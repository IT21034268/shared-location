2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this product after seeing that it had over 1,000 positive reviews. However, it just didn't work well with my LG phone. I was told that I sounded ""blown out,"" like it was trying to amplify my voice in a weird way. I tested my phone with a friend's Motorola bluetooth headset to see if it was my phone that was the problem, but with the Motorola, I sounded crystal clear. I'm returning the headset and will buy a Motorola instead. I'm giving it two stars because it was easy to set up, comfortable, and I could hear the callers just fine. But if they can't hear you, then what's the point?"
2,"Nice design, but needs more work","Nice fit, but has too much interference and a short range. Will be sending it back."
4,Good deal,"I've had the headset for a couple of months now and I am happy with my purchase.Pros:- Comfortable on the ear and looks & feels ""sleek""- Good sound quality (inward)- Acceptable voice quality (outward)- Easy to accept an incoming call (with the touch of the small silver button on the side of the unit)- Easy to switch from one ear to the other- Easy to set up- Purchase from Amazon was as expected -- Easy transaction, competitive price, tax free, quick and free shipping.Cons:- I am told that my voice sometimes sounds a little ""bottled up"", but still clear and loud.- The button to turn it on seems a little small and hard to push, although I suppose that is a good thing for those that may easily push a wrong button.Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend this to others."
4,Pleasing performance,I've used this product for around 4 months now and I am pleased with it. It provides sufficient volume for myself and the listeners on the other end. I would recommend the product.
4,"Very functional, reliable, and works well!","It took me just a little time to get used to this headset but I do love it. I have to admit that for the price, it works really well. Sometimes, it loses connection even though the power is on and bluetooth is blinking blue light, but if you reset it, it reconnects. Sometimes, I have not heard calls come in so reliability for me has been around 95%. I am giving it 4 stars because for the price and comfort, it works quite well. Watch out for battery drainage on the cell so if not using, make sure to power off the bluetooth Power On to Off. It is a concern not to lose it - it's small and without wires. I left it in the Juice store but it was right there when I went back (lucky me)!I highly recommend it overall!"
3,Still haven't found the perect headset yet,"I've had this one for about 7 or 8 months and it is comfortable, and I can hear very well, but most of the people I talk to say I sound low and I have to repeat myself over and over or almost scream at times. This varies from day to day so it could be the location or the way the planets are aligned at the time LOL I don't know. I have been considering the Jabra 250, I've heard it's comfortable and works well, but that could be just one or two people's opinions."
2,OK but mic falls short,"Everything works as expected however, after 6 months of use, I can confirm that the microphone falls short. I have to speak loudly in order for it to be clear to the listener and in this age of cubicles and less personal space that doesn't really work for me."
4,Plantronics Voyager 510,"I tried several bluetooth earpieces. I was looking for performance, people on the other end could hear me clearly. I was able to hear and understand all conversations, within the limits of my phone. All of the devices I tried were easy to connect to my phone. Looking cool was not a concern I think they all look a bit goofy. Amazon offered the best price & no shipping charges which could add quit a bit to the price. Amazon's price was appproximately 1/2 of retail store price for this product. The only thing this headset didn't offer was ability to xfer or call waiting, however it can be done from the phone, which almost defeats the purpose."
2,"Sadly, Had to Give Up on My 510","Have been a loyal Plantronics customer for over 20 years - first PC video cards, then wired headsets, and now Bluetooth headsets. Had two of the 510's. They worked great for their function, but had to give up on them.Lost one, and used it's charger on the replacement 510 I bought. That original charger died - fair enough, just got out the charger that came with the new one. After a few months that one died, too. Figuring to side-step the apparent charger problem, I got the USB charger cable. Guess what - the 510 would not take a charge. Had to retire it and the pricey USB charger cable, and give up on Plantronics. Bought a new Motorola headset, and hope it works out - at least it's charge port is a mini-USB and not that strange thing Plantronics put on the 510."
5,Plantronics a winner,I set out to find the best bluetooth for my use. This involved buying about 10 different units (which I am not disposing of) The Plantronics clearly was the best of all those I tried. Both reception and broadcast quality are excellent. Even being outside in the wind has not been a problem. I also tried the Plantronic Pro but actually preferred the older (and much cheaper) 510. I do have some issues with it separating from my Blackberry Storm but that is a minor problem. The price on Amazon was as good as any sources I checked.
1,poor charging disign,"I have had this blue tooth for about a year. The small charging connection is very poorly disigned. It ""sunk in"" within 6 months......tried to remedy it, but no such luck. Look for something more sturdy. But I will say it is very comfrotable to wear, albeit does plug the ear so it cuts down on you abilty to hear."
1,2 for 2 arrived broken,"Bought one, it arrived broken. Exchange piece arrived and was also broken, same problem. Broken power button."
1,In a tunnel...,"I hate this headset. I bought it because it had a lot of good reviews but I can't imagine what people were comparing it to. Ever since the beginning everyone has told me it sounds like I'm in a tunnel and I've tried it with several phones. I've only had it a year and now that I have a new phone, it won't pair with it. Although I fully charged it last night, it's turning itself off like it's dead. I will spend a little more money and buy something else that works."
2,hmmm...,"I'm having problems with this headset, but I really don't know if it's a compatibility problem between my E71 and this headset o if it's a headset problem. I've been trying to get some help from Plantronics... got no answer."
3,Sound volume level good But not all it is built up to be.,"The sound quality is good but on my Motorola phone, it does not allow me to answer calls or hang up with buttons as stated. Fits the ear ok and can be moved from ear to ear easily. Just wished the thing would work like they claim with my Motorola phone."
4,Not perfect but quite good.,"After much research, I bought this bluetooth headset on the recommendation of other reviewers. I am quite pleased with its performance and comfort. It does still have wind noise when outside and some have complained of slight echo when I speak, but everyone says it is minor and not a distraction. They say I am nice and clear and easy to understand as well. The earpiece is VERY comfortable and easy to keep in for long periods of time. The controls are not difficult to use although they are pretty small. The earpiece volume is excellent as well when adjusted properly. For someone who hasn't used a bluetooth much prior to this, I am very pleased with its performance."
4,Good Product,"Works very well. My boyfriend didn't like because it was a little bulky, so I took it over. It is a little bulky, but I don't mind it as much. The quality though makes up for the bulkiness of it. People can hear me very clearly and it is a lot better than the Motorola bluetooth I used to have. If you don't mind the heaviness of it, then I would highly recommend this product."
5,Great Headset !! Worth The Money !,"The Plantronics headset is one of the best headsets i have tried since bluetooth has come out. I have tried several Motorola headsets , and none of them have come close to this headset . This Headset has great sound quality for you , and the person you are speaking to .People i am talking to dont even know that i am on a bluetooth headset when i talk with them . The only disadvantage to this headset is it is a lot bigger than most bluetooth headsets , but dont let the size fool you because it is extremely comfortable , and you can forget it is in your ear .Great headset for a great price . Buy this over a motorola anyday !"
4,The right headset for the money,"The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth headset does everything I expected it to. It sounds good in all kinds of conditions, it is easy to use and it seems pretty durable (though at this point I have only had mine for about a month). Overall, I would confidently recommend this product."
4,Does the job,"I've had this headset for about one month now. It does what it needs to do but it isn't perfect. I hear some static between the phone and the headset, but the overall sound quality is good. I might try a different one in the future, but for now it will keep me out of trouble when I drive in California (hands-free law)."
3,Good but not that great,"bought this recently after reading all the positive reports. though plantronics is well known for having some of the best BT headsets and this one seems to be in that category, i was disappointed by the amount of noise that comes through the earplug, plus others on the line had a tough time reading me clearly"
5,Perfect for truckers,This is a wonderful bluetooth headset. It is by far the loudest I've have ever heard. I highly recommend it.
2,"no carcharger, bad battery","I bought this headset because I am in my car alot, and my old motorola was extremely noisy... The sound with this headset is great...no more car noise for my clients. I like the fit, and found it very easy to use. The downside is that they don't offer a carcharger, so I have to take it out of my car and find an outlet to charge it. If you travel as much as I do, this just doesn't work. Second, the battery worked great for the first couple of months, but now it won't hold a charge. Since I bought this headset over six months ago, plantronics won't help me at all. I am sure there are better products out there... I am looking myself, as this headset is not worth the trouble..."
4,Better than other !!!,Good quality while battery is charged. It's very difficult to find better bluetooth headset.
2,Passable performance,"I was too cheap to purchase the Jawbone or other higher priced BT headsets. You get what you pay for. The sound is passable, but the wind noise for people at the other end of the call make using this unit outside in even the slightest breeze unacceptable. The part of the unit that goes behind the ear is bulky and the on/off button is hard to access when the unit is on your ear. I wouldn't buy this unit again, but I don't hate it enough to replace it."
4,works great!,"It worked out of the package. It has several size earbuds so that you get the right size for you. It paired with my phone easily, and it is comfortable to wear: not too heavy and it doesn't feel like it's going to fall off any second. Great product!"
3,"Fine, except for voice dialing","My biggest frustration with this headset is trying to get my phone to understand voice commands when traveling in a car with road noise, etc. It's almost useless that way. I have it paired with a Blackberry Curve. Voice commands work great directly with the phone, but I guess there's just too much background noise when speaking through the mic. I haven't tried any other headsets, so I don't know if that's just a problem with this one, or if it's a common problem with bluetooth headsets.Added Dec. 26, 2009: I have since upgraded my phone to a BlackBerry Tour, and this headset wouldn't even pair with it. I then purchased a BlackBerry headset which works beautifully - no more problems with voice commands in the car."
4,Good buy,"The Plantonics Voyager 510 is a good buy for the money. I have been using it for approx 1 month, and no audio problems. I can hear everyone well, and no complaints from anyone listening. I lose the connection, while idle, one in a while, but it picks it back up in about 30 secs. Like others, I'm not crazy about the power button. However, overall a nice product. Very happy with it."
4,Works great,"I've tried other headsets, but I keep returning to this one. It's well balanced on the ear and comfortable that I frequently forget that I'm wearing it. The noise cancelling isn't as effective with a lot of wind noise."
4,overall good product,"great product; good sound. only complaints are that 1) it's difficult to switch from built-in car bluetooth to in-ear bluetooth and 2)it's slightly larger than other models and occasionally has difficulty staying on my ears.Otherwise, great value!"
2,nice fit. but was not compatible.,Did not work with my verizon phone and had to ship it back. Has an annoying double beeping sound in between calls. Not a good connection with my bluetooth. Great design though and good fit on ear.
4,Great Headset,"This is a great headset for the money. The sound quality is extremely good, even when used in noisy and windy conditions. Most people that I talk with don't know that I'm using a headset. I have had no problem pairing it with both Motorola and Samsung mobile phones. Hands free voice activated operation with both phones is no problem at all. Battery life is pretty good with this unit, I only need to charge it every 2 or 3 days when I use it 8 to 10 hours a day. The unit feels a little bulky at first, but becomes quite comfortable very quickly. The only annoyance is the small size and placement of the power button. Other than that, I highly recommend the Voyager 510."
5,plantronics,The handsfree is wonderful. I would tell others to buy one . I`ve been in the rain with the last few weeks and the thing is still working. So just by that i would buy another one if i need one but so far nothing is wrong with it .
1,angry,i got this product and after just one use it doesnty work porperly . it makes me very unhappy.. how do i get a refund?
1,everything that says new is not!,received the plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset that was said to be new but only the ear plugs were new. the bluetooth and the charger had obvious usage (dirty tip and loose parts)
4,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth,"An excellent bluetooth headset!. Bought two for my wife and me. This was my third one. Clarity of sound excellent. Holds well on the ear. Convenient multi-function button. Much better than the Motorola headsets I tried before switching to Plantronics in terms of sound, reliability and pure durability."
5,"Bluetooth fast, human slow.","This Bluetooth paired immediately with my LG phone. Now I need to figure out how to use it. I get confused when it is in my ear and still need to fumble with cellphone. It will just take time, I'm sure."
5,This thing is a tank!,"This was my first bluetooth and I must say, I made the right choice. The day I received it in the mail I lost it. Apparently I dropped it in my friends parking lot. She found it a few days later. It had been run over and lots of scratches...and it still works just fine! I've used it driving, outside, and just sitting at home. No situation is too difficult. The only complaint I have is that it's rather large and falls off my ear every now and then. Although, I have very small ears. You should stop looking for a bluetooth and just buy this one! :-)"
3,So So,"Good sound quality, but difficult to turn on and off. Not as easy to use as I thought. Also my ears are small, so the piece behind the ear doesn't always stay in place"
3,Disappointment,"I have used this headset for a couple of months (paired with a Cingular 8125), and it has been a real disappointment.The 'multipoint technology' is a joke. Trying to switch between my PC Bluetooth adapter and my phone just locks up both connections.Many times when I answer the phone, the other party hears a sharp growling sound for a second or two. Several different callers have complained about this -- not a good first impression if you're using this headset for business.Sound quality is no better than average. Callers notice wind noise about like most other headsets.I find the headset more comfortable than most, because its wraparound style stays on the ear better than others."
3,Not too shabby,"I've had mine for almost a year, and it holds up very well. The best thing about this handset are the battery life--I've never had it run out on me,and I spend hours and hours on the phone every day. Another big plus is the ease of use: this handset works so simply that even my mom can use it. It has a single button that is pushed to answer calls or held down to turn it on or off. However, there is one significant drawback that potential users must consider: static. As another review mentioned, while it is possible to use this phone at a range, the static in the background can be extremely irritating. I often end up keeping my phone on me when using the device, somewhat mitigating the advantage of having bluetooth. Additionally, it does pick up a bit of background noise-especially wind. But if I use my headset indoors, the interference is minimal. All in all, it works well within it's limitations."
3,Didn' t meet my expectations,"I bought the platronics 510 specficially for the noise cancellation that was advertised. Although the price was good, the noise cancellation was not. Callers that I was talking with could hear me type on the computer as I was on the phone. I give 5 stars to Amazon's return policy. They made it very easy for me to get what I wanted. I returned the Voyager 510 for the Jawbone. I guess you pay for what you get."
4,Bluetooth headsdt,"I like the product, it works very well. The only thing that is a discouraging factor with this product is I have small ears and it is very uncomfortable for me to wear. I have a motorola bluetooth and it is much better. Other than that it works very well."
2,BlueTooth Headset,"purchased this item to use skype and listen to music on my desktop computer. Sound quality on the headset is poor, sounds like a cheap transister radio, i use wired earbud and it is much better, but wired. as far as using skype with the headset goes, there is a second or so of latency, so when having a conversation, there is a lot of waiting, people will answer the phone and think no one is there. the range for the bluetooth is good but that is the only bright point in the setup. i'd wait until the technonogy is better, sound quality is a real bummer. the idea of not having wires is great but the negatives outweigh the positives, i'm back to the wired earbud."
1,Bluetooth headset unusable,"This was a complete waste of money. It runs flat after oh, about an hour, even when not being used. And the audio quality is so bad you're better off not using it anyway. I've tried using it with a blackberry and a Mac, and in both cases I've disconnected it because the quality was so bad."
4,I prefer wires...,"I have this (I own other things too), and it fits in my ear just great, and when it connects, great; but sometimes it doesn't connect as fast as I want and then it also has it's own battery that needs to be recharged and so on... For someone like me 6'3"" and brown hair and a teacher, I just prefer a simple headset with wires that doesn't need to be recharged.If we ever talk on the phone then maybe you can tell me what choice you made, while IRONICALLY you may even be talking on your headset!!! werid how life works like that"
3,okay,"this product is ok on the ps3 because whenever you turn on the headset after the controller it messes up the signal on the crontroller, so you would have to turn the controller on and off again."
1,Item Arrived Dead but its nice once I got it,"I commented on someone else review, but my headset arrived brand new and dead in the package. The company I purchased it from through Amazon immediately shipped me another via Priority Mail and the second did work. I will update my review as I use the item, but the low rating is due to needing to get the 2nd one.Things I like so far:-multiple sized ear buds-I can't wear many devices with MP3s, cd players, traditional headsets due to the size of the ear buds-I can wear it for hours and have no problem. I even wear it with my glasses-The battery is lasting a long time and I will charge it to make myself feel better and it will be fully very quickly.-I hear everyone fine and they say I come through clear.-It easily converts to the Left or Right Ear.Things that I do not like:-The on button is such a weird shape and small that it takes work to turn the device on if I am not pushing the button just right."
3,Great Headset? It depends,"I got this headset because of high praises and recommendation of a good friend of mine. But unfortunately, like all of the other bluetooth headsets that I've pair w/ my Treo 650, the headset performance was sporadic - most of the time people complain they can't hear me very well, every once in a while no problem. If you have a Treo 650, then this might not be for you."
5,Voyager 510 - Superb Product,"This is a great product! Settled on this after trying couple of Motorola products....I am glad I got this, and it does exactly as it promises. Along with its exceptional voice quality and its range, I especially like its ability to connect to two devices at the same time. This is very convenient for me since I carry two phones, one personal and the other given by my company, and no matter which of those I use, the headset is active. I have not found any other Bluetooth headset that supports two devices simultaneously!!!Definitely worth a buy!!!"
4,plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset,A very good value item. Delivery was prompt and all in good order
3,"Very good, hope it lasts","Definitely a much better headset than the other two Motorola models that I also own -- it is loud, clear and the battery lasts a good two days between stand-by and light/medium use. It is a little larger in size but it is light in weight and comfortable for extended wear (3-4 hours at a time).There is one drawback, the unusual power cord/plug. After only 1-2 months of use, the headset started to not charge properly unless the plug is connected to the bottom of the headset just right.***10/2008***I liked it so much, I bought one for my wife. Unfortunately, hers die within 2 months with very light use. And, I mean 'light' -- it spent most of its life sitting on her nightstand. The light indicator went dark (not turned off) and it wasn't picking up her voice when she speaks into it. We returned it for a replacement and this one appears to be working just fine."
4,Great Product,"This blue tooth is really good compared to the other blue tooth devices I had. Pros are, Sound quality and comfort wearing. It get connected to my sony ericsson W810i instantly. Earlier I had scala headset, which got disconnected quite often.. and i don't find a problem with this device.Good one to go!!"
5,Works well,This device works very well. Battery life is quite good and reception is excellent. It's quite a hardy little thing too.
4,A reliable headset worth the money.,"My wife and I purchased a couple different Motorola headsets prior to finally trying the Voyager 510. Allot of background noise was present with the Motorolas, i.e. road noise while driving was the biggest annoyance. The Voyager 510 models are much quieter with almost no background noise issues whatsoever. It is comfortable to wear; however a little more cumbersome to slip over the ear than others we have tried. The Voyager 510 is easy to configure with your phone and once configured, never looses synch even after multiple power on/off cycles, unlike the Motorolas we tried. It's a great little device to add simplicity to using your cell phone!"
3,A little disapointed,A friend had this bluetooth headset and reccomended it. But my friend is much bigger than I am. Althought the headset comes with 3 ear buds (which work just fine) the actual part that goes arround my ear doesn't seem to get small enough to feel like it's going to stay on. I've also had some issues with it just disconnecting from my phone while I'm talking on it. The clarity is great and the headset seems to be made well.
1,review,This unit is way too delicate. The microphone stopped working and I got it replaced under warranty--then the second one broke too and I just gave up! And I did not put the unit through unusual wear and tear. Terrible.
5,best bluetooth!,"This is my 3rd and 4th order for this bluetooth because I keep losing them! I have recommended it to all my friendsfor it's clarity of sound and good, comfortable fit, plus good decent pricing."
1,No go for Treo 700P,"didn't work with my Treo 700p. Called Plantronics - they said doesn't work with this phone. Pretty popular phone, would've helped if something was mentioned in the promo on this."
5,Great clarity,"I'm very pleased with this headset. It is comfortable and stable on the ear and the clarity is good. The volume button on the back can be tough to adjust while the unit is on your ear, but that's only a small drawback. Overall this is a great headset."
2,Great headset poor quality control,"Well, I must say I am very disappointed. All the great reviews and I picked it based on that. The first one I got the side button did not work, Amazon quickly replaced it. The second one worked great for a few days then it started dropping the connection constantly. Then I had to keep pairing it, then it wouldn't go in to pairing mode even though the buttons seemed to be working. Two strikes and your out. I went back to my trusty Scala 500. The voice quality is not as good as the Plantronics but it works every time and keeps the connection. The Scala is not as comfortable as the Voyager either. I use Plantronics BT for my home office and it is great - don't know why I had these issues with this great headset. Maybe I will try one in a few months."
3,Great sound quality at both ends but comfort may be an issue,"The sound quality is tops both at the sending and receiving ends. However, the ear hook is on the thick side. This can be a problem for ears that lie close to the head - the earhook pushes the ear away from the head. First, this does create a rather odd looking mismatched pair of ears! Second, it can become uncomfortable after prolonged use. It also poses a problem when wearing eyeglasses - one temple rests on top of the headset ear hook with the other at ear height. This causes the eyeglasses to rest lop-sided. So, buyer beware. The sound quality is great. The comfort issue could be a problem for you."
2,Not so happy,"I bought 2 of this one for my wife and the other one was for myself. The one that I have doesn't have enough volume and it is bulky and it still does work. My wifes on the other hand broke about 4 months after we got them and they (Plantronics) told me that they will not replace nor will they give any credit. I also had bought them here on Amazon for 40 bucks apiece and now I see them at 137.00, are then nuts!!, I will not buy any product again by Plantronics. Amazon has been great to me and have got other stuff from them fast and never had a problem with Amazon."
4,Okay headset.,"This was an okay headset, during my days of wanting a BT headset. It's a bit bulky compared the other higher end ones, but does the job. Mine eventually died out because I sweat a lot, and I think something shorted internally. I used it 2+ years, though. Most small electronics does not even last 1+ years."
2,Item appeared/looked used,"I purchased this headset over a brand new one because of the savings; however, I wasn't pleased with the headset. The headset was marked ""new"" but not in retail packaging some scratches due to shipping. When I received the headset it looked used, the microphone piece was filthy along with the rest of the headset. The seller did inform me there would be some dirt and scratches but to me it appeared used. I have a very old Plantronics headset for my cell phone and it didn't look as bad as this one.While I wasn't happy with the actual item the seller responded to my email quickly and credited my account, minus shipping, once she received the headset back. If you are not concerned with appearances of the headset and more concerned with saving money this is the way to go. If you are leary like I was then the new one is the way to go. I since have purchased the brand new Plantronics 510 Voyager and so far so good, it works great.Thanks"
3,Deceptive Advertising for a good product,"The headset is great, works better than I had hoped. Delivery time was even better, was in my mailbox very quickly. Begs to question the need to show it on the website with the charging base, when there is no intention of delivering one with the headset. I guess it sells product, but will never get another dollar from this customer. Great product, but I am tired of deceptive advertising."
5,best head set yet,"it's clear both ways( what you hear and what others hear), it's light, it folds, comfortable on ear, price is right too :)"
4,Awesome,"I've had this one for about 2 months now, it's pretty awesome, I use it with my SonyEricsson Xperia X10 and it works like charm, I can talk away from the phone to 8 metters, the battery life is awesome, just as described. The only point I don't like is the lack of volume, in noisy environments is pretty hard to listen. However I recommend it."
2,Eh... couldn't get it to fit my face right,"I've tried too many bluetooth headsets to remember. Seems they all have a major shortcoming... volume too low, static, terrible battery life, something.For me, the Voyager 510 sounded great, but I couldn't get it to rest correctly against my face... the mic insisted on pointing OUT, away from my mouth. Could be my big head... I'm not sure.I recently purchased the new model of the Voyager 510, the Voyager 520, and love it!It still has excellent battery life of the 510 (in fact, slightly longer battery life!), excellent noise and wind reduction, and very comfortable, all in a more traditional style.Search for Voyager 520 on Amazon, and check it out, if the 510 didn't quite work for you."
4,"Comfortable and loud, yes, but...","After one disappointing Motorola bluetooth after another it was a pleasure to find my new Plantronics 510 had much better audio quality and was more comfortable to wear. However, the lack of a call waiting feature was a minus for me. Furthermore, the confusing warning tones it issues, sometimes without an explicable reason, makes it difficult to tell when the battery is running down and when it's just beeping for the fun of it. Thus I constantly have lost calls due to the battery dying. Unfortunately the user guide is very skimpy on details as to what the warning tones all mean. At least Motorola doesn't leave you guessing in that respect. All that said, as long as you don't need to conveniently switch between callers (especially when driving or transferring the call to the phone for switching callers would otherwise prove unsafe) and if you remember to recharge it no matter what the status light says, then this is the phone for you."
4,great for the price,"great product, I had some defected ones though and this does hurt my ear some, I have to take it off after a few hours.moisture gets in the charging port causing corosion.over all it works very good if you get a good one. (pl v 510 )"
4,"Not thrilled, but satisfied","The Voyager 510 works like a charm. Connects easily and fairly quickly, I guess (my first cell phone and my first Bluetooth headset). Range is incredible, although I can't conceive any situation in which I'd need to go more than five feet away from my phone (it's usually in my pocket or on my desk). So far I've gotten great battery life. I like the blue LED.A few downsides:-Frequency range of the headset isn't fantastic. The sound quality of it is good, but not superb. This is more of a problem with Bluetooth than with the headset itself, though.-Ergonomically questionable-- it fits very well once you get it on, but it's a little hard to adjust, especially when it's on your ear. It also feels very flimsy. I wouldn't mind having a little more weight so I could feel safe just putting it in my jeans pocket.-Volume buttons and especially the power buttton are rather hard to fiddle with while it's on your ear."
3,Voyager Review,"The earpiece is a comfortable wear, but the clarity is lacking. It is a very difficult earpiece to hear with,"
2,Voice Quality is OK but its little heavy,Voice Quality is OK but its little heavy and ear pains if you wear it for long.
3,"Good, Minor Problem","Only problem is it doesn't sit down in the ear canal far enough, requiring volume to be increased more than otherwise necessary and causing distortion. Needs to be made so that the curved stalk connecting the part that rests behind the ear and the earspeaker will hold it's shape, positioning the earspeaker closer to ones ear."
2,Used this for one year-Picks up a lot of background noise-,It picks up a lot of background noise...people I call are always complaining that they can't hear me well and I end up having to switch to phone mode and then they can hear me well. The thicker part that goes behind your ear can be quite large and uncomfortable. It comes with an assortment of ear buds (different sizes) they tend to unscrew and fall off; it still works without an ear bud but very uncomfortable.
4,Very nice!!,"I tried six different headsets before this one. This is by far the best as far as noise cancelling and voice quality. I drive a Semi-truck for a living and back ground noise is a problem for all but a very few headsets, wired or wireless.The motorolas didn't cut it although the V3 did thr best job of the three I tried the others being the 750 and 850 I believe.I also tried the Jabra 525 and a $50 Nokia and a LG. None compared. My friends and family chose this one hands down."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I have used mine for about a month. I am using it with an I-Mate Jam. I LOVE IT. Extremely light and comfortable. Sometimes I forget I have it on my ear. Extremely awesome sound quality. At home, I leave my phone where it gets a strong signal.. and I can talk with perfect clarity. I love the fact that I can stick it in my pocket, and take it out just to answer calls.Great product. Worth every single penny."
3,"Great Fit, Poor Controls","This Plantronics headset is the most comfortable fitting Bluetooth headset I have ever worn. It is light, flexible, and it can easily be forgotten after a few minutes. The fit is simply fantastic.The controls however, are very poorly designed. The on-off button is so small it takes a fingernail to depress it. The volume rocker is a little bigger, but still too small. The main call button is easier to find, but very difficult to depress. On this particular headset, I had to press extremely hard to activate the voice dial on my phone.Plantronics has a winner here in fit, but I can only give three stars due to the small buttons. I ordered one, but am returning it because it simply is too cumbersome to use."
5,Great wireless headset!,I bought these headsets for my entire team at work. The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them. They are comfortable and the sound quality is good. Best of all was the price - almost half of what I found it for elsewhere!
4,User friendly aspects of Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth,"I really like the fact that this product is light weight, is soft and plyable, is comfortable to wear in my ear for long periods of time, and has great sound. I do not like the fact that the blue light on the boom flashes so brightly and attacts attention wherever I go, especially when it is reduced light."
5,good product,the item is the best bluetooth i ever owned. i will repeat buying the same one if this one goes bad after a while
5,I forget it is in my ear!,"Light weight and comfortable to wear. This is the third head set that I have owned, and I am very pleased with the product. If I could, I would do away with the blinking blue light, but that is my only negative comment about this unit.I use this while I work (a house painter) and it allows me to talk and work at the same time. I love it!"
5,Always been skeptical...but this one works well,"I've heard too many stories about poor quality bluetooth headsets so i waited a long time before deciding to plunk down the money for one. Glad i did, because this one works great.+ The sound quality is clear and the volume is strong. No complaints from the people i'm talking to and i can hear them clearly as well. You do have to put one of the ear buds in and screw it into place otherwise you will hear a hissing sound...but once its in, no problems.+ The earpiece itself is much more flexible than the picture led me to believe, so its relatively comfortable (but we're still talking about a hunk of plastic hanging from your ear). You can reverse it to wear on your left ear.- Having to hold down the power button for 3 seconds to turn it on and off is a bit of a pain...though a minor one."
1,Don't like it,Does not fit well for those who were glasses. Had it for 3 months and does not hold a good charge and it has alot of static. Hope I can find a better one that fits and sounds better without static and interuption. Would not recomend. It is being replaced under warranty from factory hopefuly this is just a bad one. Does not stay on well likes to fall off when you bend over or lean to the side.
4,"Performs reliably and adequately, but not stellarly","The title says it all. This thing works well and reliably, but often people say I sound good - though not great - and the multi-function button is non-intuitive for some of the higher functions. What can ya do."
3,Best of the worst,"Relatively inexpensive, fits moderately comfortably (6-10) and the noise cancelling feature seems to work OK. The on and off switch is terrible--it is very tight and located in a difficult to reach area."
3,Works as expected,"Works fine. But I'm still not happy. This is my third/fourth Plantronics headset.This one bought for dual pairing with my LT and my cell phone.(iPhone).It works fine with both.I am subtracting marks for the followinga) Changing charger designs. Third headset, none of the chargers are interchangeable, so I always get the AC charger, but have to buy the car chargerb) For iPhone, this works only for the phone. Music will not work. Now I am looking instead at the Plantronics 855 Stereo Headset - do handle both = phone/music and still do dual pairing with LT"
5,Excellent product,"The Plantronics Voyager 510 has excellent sound quality. It is very comfortable to wear; not heavy at all, and feels soft on the ear. The on/off button IS rather tiny, but that isn't a real problem."
3,Great sound quality.. super uncomfortable,"I had to return this bluetooth. When I tried it out, the sound quality was fabulous. Everyone on the other end was able to hear me without any problems. However, I had to return it because it was so uncomfortable and after talking for 5 minutes, I would have to hang up. It does come with different earbuds, but I could not find one that didn't hurt. So, I returned it for this reason. However, a friend has this bluetooth and does not have the discomfort.. so it depends on your ear!"
5,"Very Decent Quality, I must say.","The Plantronics is a decent headset for the price. I have used 2 Motorola headsets, and after using a Plantronics telephone headset at my office and liking it, I decided to get the Plantronics 510 Bluetooth for my cell. Compared to the Motorola, it sounds better on my end--good volume. Folks on the other end say it sounds better than my Moto--especially in noisy environments, like the car. Very decent battery life--very good, in fact. I like that they include different size foam ear pieces so that you can get it positioned with your ear, just right.Cons: after a couple of hours, it gets a little uncomfortable. And, it doesn't fold up, so it's a little awkward trying to carry it in a pocket. And, why must the light flash?--there's got to be a way to turn off the light--I just haven't looked into it. My Moto is the same way.All in all, a good value."
2,Don't buy this if you wear glasses,Pros:1. decent sound qualityThat's all I have for pros.Cons:1. Poor in-ear fit; poor fit with glasses2. Too heavy behind the ear - slipped off often3. Disconnected from phone every 2 minutesBelow average product that is not worth your time.
3,"Ok but,","Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]Well, I have use several plantronics headsets, all the in ear only fit.They have all been great, light, secure fit.When I got the voyager, I immediately found a problem fitting it in my ear. It uses ear cushions different that the others I have used.It also did not feel secure since it also goes over and behind the ear when I put sunshades on. As far as communications, they were fine. I just wish I could find a headset that had the technology of the voyager and just in the ear and secure, not also over the ear."
2,Works but not as well as I'd hoped,"This is the first Bluetooth device I've had. I got it due to the recent legislation in CA requiring handsfree devices to talk on the phone while driving.I find it clunky to wear and am told, often, by the people I'm speaking with the the sound quality is not very good.Setup was easy, battery life is so so and I would recommend a friend try something else."
2,Wasn't for me,"The power button is difficult to turn on and off, there's a delay between turning it on and it turning on so sometimes I would press the button a second time only to have it turn off on me (vice versa when I was trying to turn it off). The power button has a section that points up and hurt my fingers when trying to turn it on and off. I had a difficult time fitting the headset on my ear, it seemed to fall off frequently. In the end I decided to return this headset, too many negatives."
2,"Bad sound quality, poor build quality","I bought this thing in 2006 and I've never been happy with it. The sound in the ear bud is pretty poor and the people on the other end of the line complain about how bad I sound. To add insult to injury, the volume rocker no longer worked after about a year of use."
1,Horrible,This is the second Plantronics Voyager 510 headset that I have owned. The first one was GREAT. So after 3 years it died and I made no hesitation to buy another one. But the new one is HORRIBLE. I literally have to hold my phone in the air above my head for it to work. I cannot move more than 2 feet away from my phone before it quits working. It has a constant static sound in the headset so bad that it is completely useless.
4,Great headset,"While its size and bulk may dissuade some people, this headset weighs very little and is very comfortable. The volume at which I can hear conversations surprised me--I don't have it at full volume and I can still hear over the noise of freeway traffic, something I have until recently not expected of a headset. It was remarkably easy to link with my Motorola phone and I have not noticed significant battery drain (still running on its first charge!). The only thing keeping this headset from getting 5 stars is the fact that--like all headsets I've tried--it starts to make my ear hurt about two hours after beginning to wear it, even though it's remarkably comfortable for the first hour or so."
3,not too good,"the headset fits well and is comfortable. But, when it comes to the sound quality, I did not find it too good. There is a lot of static on my side as well as on the other side. It can in no manner compare to the quality of directly speaking in to the phone or into the wired earphones/mic. Makes sense only if you are too busy to hold a phone in your hand and also find the wired options too clumsy."
5,Great comfort and it works !,I bought this for myself but after my wife tried it I never saw it again. Now I need to buy another one. This doesn't suffer the problem of falling off your ear when you least expect it. It's a great unit.
2,Appears to have higher ratings here than it deserves,"Have been using this for a couple of months now. Not particularly impressed with it.Pro's:- Pretty light, does not feel heavy on the ear.Con's:- Pairing with my phone is very tempermental (I realize pairing is a two way thing, I use mine with the first generation iPhone).- Sound quality is not good.- Does not sit well/snuggly. Feels like it will fall off the ear all the time!I would not reccomend buying this."
2,Sometimes works sometimes doesn't,"Poor pairing signal. Sometimes I can make/receive calls, sometimes I get the ""two beeps,"" which means my device is having trouble connecting to my phone. Pretty frustrating. I've tried re-setting/ connecting the two devices multiple times, even to the point where I take the battery out of my cell phone --that sort of thing but nothing seems to make it work properly. But I shouldn't complain too much as I only paid $40 for it and it already seems way outdated. I only purchased it because I like the ear design. Buy something else."
2,Not as impressed as others,"I had been and am currently using a jabra. This was my very first bluetooth device. I was having some difficulty with answering the phone on the actual headset as well as hanging up calls. There's no sense in being hands-free if you can't be hands-free. Having looked on amazon and read the reviews I bought this plantronics device. It gets great reviews.I did not hate it. Initially I was able to answer calls more easily but hanging up was still an issue. The biggest draw-back was that, after 4 months of no complaints regarding sound quality from those with whom I was speaking, I regularly had people telling me that there was fuzz and that they couldn't hear me. I also experienced a lot of noise on my end.I returned to my original jabra, practiced, and now really love it and use it regularly. If I knew which model I would tell you. Sorry."
3,Has plusses and minuses,"This is my 3rd bluetooth headset and my 2nd Plantronics.Plusses: works really well with my phone, even up to 20' away. I've dropped it lots of times and it's holding up nicely. Easily adjusts to either ear. Turns on & off easily.Negatives: People complain they can't hear me on a regular basis (even when there isn't noise around me). Is awful with wind noise. Is much clunkier than my last Plantronics (330). My phone knows it's there but is often very slow to transfer over to the headset.Overall, I am disappointed with the headset - other than the range between it & the phone, it's is not as good as the Plantronics 330."
3,Not for small years,"I bought the Plantronics Voyager 510 based on reviews here, with my only bluetooth headset experience being the Motorola S9 stereo so was not familiar with an earpiece that fits around the ear. It is a nice headset and I was able to hear clearly, but very quickly found that it is not the headset for me. I have small ears and the bulky back fit in such a way that I had a sore spot after wearing it less than 10 minutes. Even with the smallest earpiece, I couldn't keep it securely in my ear. Probably because of the way it weighs down and kept shifting away from my head, people on the other end reported they could hear other noise around me almost more than they could hear me.All in all, I would say that the reviews are correct as to sound, but if you have small ears, take a second look before buying this one."
4,Worth lending your ear!!!,I knew that the ear will be stressed for some time - so I forced myself to wear the bluetooth for 2 days - that was the only inconveninceAfter that - I did not even feel that it was on my earSound quality - rating is 5 out of 5Has a fairly long life without chargingLooks good tooWould highly recommend
4,Good,I am very happy with the product. It is comfortable on my ear and the sound quality is great. The only negative is the on/off switch is not easy to use.
3,Fair quality,"I am having some disconnection and voice quality issues about this earpiece. I dont know its my phone's problem or this little thing's bad. Cuz my phone is pretty old(Moto V3), and often has bad reception. So, b4 I identify whose problem is, I can only give it a fair rating."
3,Plantronics Voyager 510,"First bluetooth headset I'ved own. Had problems with the Plantronics instructions, actually could not get it to work. Went to the web site - no help. I thought it could not be that hard, so I got my phone manual out and they had full instructions. Got it up within 2 minutes or less. Unit is comfortable, clear sound and easily to control. The only problem is turning it off or on, the button is very small and hard to push. Since this is done every time you use it on I knocked it down one star. But as I said it's my first headset."
2,Not Good,"Junk. Tried using for about a week, loses connection constantly. Won't answer most of the time when depressing button - had to flip open phone to answer. Big disappointment."
2,"Bad power button design, non-removeable battery","I got this headset after reading a bunch of reviews on several headsets. The headset itself is a nifty design, with good sound quality and it paired easily to my Tmobile dash smartphone. The only problem is the stupid POWER ON button, you have to have callused fingers to be able to press that thing and after two months of use, it stopped making contact and thereby, the thing is useless, have to throw it away.BTW, another problem is that the rechargeable battery is not removeable, so what are you supposed to do after it's lived it's life?For the above, I have to give it a 2, which is a pity, since the rest is a great design"
2,Plantronics Voyager,"Loved the sound quality of this, but didn't stay put securly (especially while on a bike). Maybe the earpiece just didn't fit me, but tried other sizes & still had the same problem."
3,Plantronics 510,They work great but don't last as long as I'd like. Be careful with plugging in the charger. The plug is a bad design. I keep buying them though. In fairness I'm pretty rough on them too.
3,Disconnect,"I have used the 510 with a Sony Ericsson not losing the connection.However, with the Razr3 and currently the LG Vu, the 510 disconnects at will, while I'm wearing it. I lose calls during conversation and have to answer calls on the cell phone because the 510 has disconnected unknowingly.I wonder if certain bluetooths matchup with a certain cell phone???Ray K"
2,Terrible noise pickup on microphone,"From my end, the headset works great. It connects easily, the battery lasts a long time, and the sound is excellent. The people I call, however, hate it passionately. It seems to pick up ridiculous amounts of ambient noise, far worse than any wired headset I've ever owned. This is very disappointing for a device in this price range.After a month of trying, I've retired this headset from daily use (to the great relief of the people I call), and plan to find something better."
4,"Good quality, not very comfortable","I haven't owned any Headsets before, so I don't have much to compare to. This headset is not comfortable enough for me to say that it is perfect. It might be that my ear is not big enough, but it falls out of my ear :)Sound and build quality seems to be good though."
2,Good when it works,"I bought this headset because I read alot of positive reviews. However, It think I got one of the few lemons. When it works it's great, audio is loud enough even though my wife says I'm deaf and you can't really feel the ear bud in your ear. However, once in awhile, the blue tooth connection will be lost with the phone. I just press the button on the headset to re-establish the connection but that can be a pain when you're in the middle of a conversation and that button is the same one that hangs up the call."
4,Plantronics 510 - comfort not withstanding,I really like the 510 ease of use and form fit. The adjustable volume helps in the different call scenarios. The ear piece does not fit well into my ear allowing other noie to interfere with the call. I have to hold it agains my ear to get a good fit. Same with all three supplied ear atachments (which was nice to have a choice). I mus just have a strange shaped ear.All in all. I love it.
5,My first bluetooth headset,"This is my first bluetooth headset. No complains whatsoever. The sound quality is excellent. The connection between the phone and the set never drops. My phone finds the headset very easily and connect very quickly. Highly recommend for people who want a nice design, light weight, and reliable bluetooth headset. Oh, and the battery life is long!! I can go without charging it for 3 days with moderate amount of talk time per day (about 2 hr per day of talk time and stand by all day)."
3,Good but not great,"The Good:Comfortable, light weight, great sound, easy to adjust.The Bad:When it goes into power save mode it can be difficult for it to wake up properly without powering it off and on.No carrying case or clip included. If you are not careful it could be crushed or broken easily by sitting on it, dropping it, etc. I would highly recommend a case or clip for it."
3,Voyager 510,"I have gone through three Jabra BT500's. With daily constant use, they last maybe 8 months to a year. So, I bought a Voyager after reading some good reviews. I've had it 2 weeks and it has worked fine. I am not getting the noise issue some have described and everyone tells me I am crystal clear. I did like my Jabra better but grew tired of them not lasting a year and thought I'd try another brand. The Jabra earpiece is much better than the 510 and the one piece construction (no moving mic) was nice. Forget about driving with the window down with either one as the wind noise is really bad on the receiving end."
1,Downfall,"I bought this exact model of Bluetooth headset a couple of years ago, and it was excellent. When it died on me, I ordered another one, but to my great disappointment, Plantronics changed the design of the microphone. The result is that your voice is muffled to the point where people have trouble understanding what you're saying, especially if you're driving a car, since the noise reduction has suffered as well. Plantronics effectively broke this device when they changed the design.I can no longer recommend this headset.UPDATE:Since writing the above, I have come into possession of another, identical headset, which actually works well. After examining other reviews, it seems that the problem is rather a number of 'lemons' floating around in the supply chain, which are not extracted from the batch offered to consumers in a timely manner. Be aware of this, and be prepared to return your purchase as defective if you are not satisfied with its performance."
4,Great Bluetooth,"Everything is great. Only one complaint, which I am not sure is it because of the service, blackberry equipment or bluetooth. But, the connection cuts on anf off every few minutes. That is a pain. Otherwise, it is agreat bluetooth, very convenient, very comfortable to ears, clear sound when works."
4,"great all around, but backside of ear piece is too big","Too conspicuous for public use unless you are into nerdom. Great in the car...long lived battery....very statisfied with all aspects of performance, except hard to turn on and off [itty-bittty switch]."
3,"Plantronics quality, a bit bulky","Plantronics is known for producing quality headphones / headsets and this bluetooth headset is no different. For me personally however, I found the headset to be a bit uncomfortable after a few minutes of wearing it. The body portion is a bit bulky for my ear and was difficult to wear for any length of time.Another issue I had was with my phone, (an Apple iPhone 3G). After about 2 weeks, my phone and headset lost connectivity. Now this could be an issue with my phone and not with the headset, but the pairing process with this headset is less than intuitive. Plantronics makes you press a combination of buttons to put it into the pairing mode, and with four buttons, I forgot which ones to press and had to refer to the documentation. Not a huge problem but other Plantronics headset I've used had a much simpler process.All in all, a good headset for the price."
4,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth,I have been using bluetooth devices over the past 4 years and have owned several devices. This is the second 510 I have purchased due to the clairity and durability of the product. I also have a hard time keeping other devices on my ear and the wrap around design is what I have found works best for me. The only draw back is the bulk or thickness of the base but worth the trade off.
2,Worked for 2 months,"This was great for the first 2 months. Month 3, it started dropping calls. By month 4, it was dropping more calls than it was answering. I replaced it with another bluetooth, because I couldn't take it anymore. I wouldn't recommend this. I now have the Samsung WEP and after a few weeks, no problems as of yet."
4,good product,"Nice product to use. Good voice quality. no signal problems, easy to connect to any cell phone."
4,great ear piece but needs some fine tuning.,"I get great receptions with this ear piece. people can hear me and don't think for a minute they are on some speaker phone. great quality and very comfortable.there are a couple of things that need improvement. The removable ear buds got very loose and fell off. they don't stay on very well. I lost one already. The connectiion between the earpiece and cell phone quits at least twice a day. All you need to do is turn the ear piece off then on again and you'll get it back. and last, the on/off button on the top is very small and hard to press to turn on/off. it actually will hurt your finger doing so.If the voice quality wasn't so great I'd only give it three stars. However, if i lost it I would probably buy it all over again."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I have always used Plantronics. Upon reading reviews of this model I decided to roll with it. It is very difficult to put on with one hand and then I would be forced to fix the microphone in order for people to hear me. This causes a problem when driving, which being in sales is a deal breaker. I would say that half my conversations, people continued to say that couldn't hear me. I also had problems syncing with my Motorola Q. Several times on the road, it just simply would not sync. Also, that last Bluetooth I had would beep once it's connected, with this it did not beep and would not know if the device was connected or not until I answered the phone. This could be a problem with the phone rather than the Bluetooth as this is the first Bluetooth I've synced with the Moto Q. Not sure.However, I cannot recommend this product at all just simply by the ease of use and conversations."
4,Great for travel,"Definitely a solid bluetooth headset for the price. Fits comfortably around the ear and the ear piece isn't an issue. For some reason unknown to me, it worked great while driving but not so much around the house. I wanted to use it hands free while at home but sound quality wasn't up to par with what I expected. Also, the individual on the receiving end would always complain that I sound like I'm talking several feet away from the phone. However, this issue wasn't a problem while I was in my car where sound quality and voice quality were excellent. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that needs a cheap headset for use while driving. For those that need a headset for their office exclusively, I wouldn't suggest this headset."
4,Review,"Plantronics 510 works great for me, no problems so far for this product from me. Great sound quality and noise canceling...it even plays the music from my mp3 player on my phone and sounds really good."
2,No/broken charge status,"In the user's manual it states that when charging it will flash red and when it is complete the blue led light will come on. The Manual also said a typical full charge is around 3 hours. The first time I charged it flashed red on the led for 4 hours, I didn't know if it was fully charged or what. I just tried charging again and kind of forgot about it, but I came back 7 hours later and it was still flashing red.I bought my girlfriend a motorola head setMotorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset [Bulk Packaged] that was much cheaper and has better charge indication. Also it fit on my ear better (although both fit fine) and I like how you can turn on/off the headset by flipping open/closed the boom instead of holding a tiny on/off button.2 stars for the high price, poor charge status indicator, and a worse ui than the motorola."
2,Incompatable with Treo 755P,I bought this because of all the positive reviews and was surprised when it was not very good but Plantronics does not support my cell phone the Treo 755P. It would have been nice to know this from the web site prior to purchasing. I love the sound quality of the Jawbone but it does not fit me-and many others.The hunt continues and Plantronics says it does not have any bluetooth headsets for the 755P!Caveat emptor!
3,Plantronics Voyager 510,"I purchased the Voyager 510 responding to the positive reviews. I cannot say that I have tried many Bluetooth headsets but I did have a Samsung product in the past that cost around $20 and worked very well. This product is just ""okay"". I can hear well over the headset but the ear bud seems too large. It is large and very noticable when on. I cannot say that it was worth the extra money. Stick with a smaller, less expensive unit."
3,Pretty good bluetooth,Washington state has a law now to get a headset/bluetooth is the way to go. My second day using this bluetooth a heard this guy next to me driving in traffic talking and I couldn't make my call so I had to re-sink my bluetooth and it worked fine. Now that more and more folks are getting bluetooth the more a problem will happen like this...not just this bluetooth but others. This has happend twice in the past 2 months.
5,Seriously a good headset,"I'm not much of a headset person. Motorola sent me a free one awhile back that connected directly to my phone, and the sound quality on it was terrible. I couldn't hear a thing and the person on the other line could barely hear me. This experience tainted my views on headsets in general.Well that awesome law came into effect and so i really needed one. I got the Voyager after reading the reviews and after testing it out i was thoroughly impressed.The 3 different earpieces it comes with helped with the overall fit so it said on my ear without feeling like it was about to fall off. It was also pretty comfortable.The best part about it was that i could hear everything clearly, and it was even louder than when i used my handset.I highly recommend this product"
4,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth,"Before purchasing, I researched Bluetooth headsets pretty thoroughly online and settled on the Platronics Voyager 510. After 3 weeks of using (I only use it in the car), it seems to have been a good choice so far - the price was one of the most reasonable and the sound quality is good. It also holds a charge for several days at a time, however, I do turn it off when I'm not in the car. My only criticism is that since I don't leave it on my ear all the time while I'm driving, it's sometimes a little tricky getting it on my ear when the phone is ringing and I'm trying to drive. The accessories for it seem unnecessary - I wouldn't waste the money on them."
3,LIMom,Satisfied with this purchase although surprised about the static reception when located a five or more feet from the phone. Good fit for my ear and comfortable for lengthy use. Would recommend.
1,good for nothing,"I thought about driving save with this device, but actually I only got nervous. I wasted my little money with this earpiece. I can barely hear anything with it, it breaks up all the time."
2,Just so-so for us,We ended up returning the Plantronics Voyager 510. The people on the other end couldn't hear us.
2,not too happy with it,"I bought this headset thinking it would be an excellent one after all the positive reviews. Personally I didn't find this headset comfortable to use: the on/off button is tiny, it doesn't fit my ear properly (not a good choice for small ears), and I tried leaving my phone in the other room while talking and the signal was weak hence the quality of the sound was terrible! A very fragile item!"
3,Pretty good in a quiet environment,"I bought this to go with my Blackberry Curve because unlike the Motorola's it will actually stay on your ear without superglue. It also has excellent controls, great audio and fits well. My only complaint is that the voice dial will not work very well with background noise. In my car I have to wait to slow down and decrease cabin noise before it understands my commands. If I turn it off and use the phone itself I can make calls. But because it stays attached to my head better than all the other headsets I have tried I will keep it."
4,Great big headset,"This headset is as good as others have reviewed it. Call quality is good (from my end and the caller's), it was easy to pair with my phone and it charged quickly. I liked the choice of ear buds, too. I couldn't give it 5 stars, though, because the thing is cartoonishly enormous! Maybe I just have a tiny little head with mouse ears, but there's no concealing this headset. It seems to me it could be half the size and be a little more inconspicuous. That being said, it is comfortable and it's lighter than my sunglasses. Luckily, though, I don't wear glasses, or it wouldn't be possible to wear this too."
2,Plantronics Voyager 510,I was drawn to this bluetooth device because it is made by Plantronics and my other Plantronics devices have been very good. Although this unit was very comfortable and fit snug to my head the voice and call quality was not up to my expectations. I now have an Aliph Jawbone and it is not as comfortable but far surpasses the Plantronics in voice and call quality.
3,Sounds Great,I bought this headset because it is rated the best sounding and transmits the best sound. It is the best I have ever had. The only downfall is the larger size and awkward controls. The sound quality trumps the control issues. The sound quality is great.
3,Ouch!,"I bought the earpiece about 1 week ago and wore it for a day and was very relieved to take it out of my ear after work! It took a while before I could get it to stay in my ear, my ears are small but I should not have had so much trouble. Problem #2: It will sync up with my work phone which is an LG but it will not sync with my Blackberry. I am seriously thinking about returning it. I wish I had known it wasn't going to sync with my Blackberry. Pro: The sound quality was very good, no one could tell I was wearing an earpiece. I guess I will keep searching...."
2,Poor microphone volume,"I only ever used it in a quiet room, but people on the other end complained that they could barely hear me. I returned it."
4,Good headset,"Pros:-Doesn't fall off the ears easily even for my small ears-Earbuds go inside the ears so it cuts off external noise even more-Setups up easily on my two smartphones (smt5600 and Cingular 3125)-Turn on and phone finds the headsets pretty immediately (beep in headset lets you know pairing has occurred)-Voice quality is pretty good (but I've only tried one other)-Good battery life.Cons:-There's a delay when you click the answer button on the side of the headset (so you'll have to wait 1-2 sec before you can say hello)-Not as compact as other models, but still compact enough"
4,good product,its a little hard to get the hang of the voice calling but it's a nice tool and the price was unbeatable.
4,Great Headset for the Money,"So far I've had this headset for about 3 months and I must say it is working quite well. I had one minor glitch in the beginning but was able to call the plantronics 800 number and get help immediately. The fit is very nice, I have used it on both ears and don't even realize I have it on. The sound is also pretty good, although you also want to make sure the volume on your phone is up too, as they work in concert. Overall a very good headset for the price. I couldn't imagine spending any more than this and I'm pleased with what I got for the money."
4,Works well with my PS3,"It's the only reason I bought this thing and it has greatly enhanced my game. It has yet to give me any problems and people I play with online say they can hear me clearly, so I'm very satisfied."
5,LOVE IT,"Bought it after reading the other reviews. I agree with all the positives. The sound is remarkable, comfort level is the best also. Just had a conversation in the car with both the window and the sunroof open, the party on the other line had no idea I was not sitting in my house with a phone to my ear."
2,Did not work on my Iphone 3gs,"I bought this headset after reading all the fantastic reviews and seeing it as amazon's number 1 headset. The headset fits great! When paired with my Iphone 3gs the sound was SO LOW that it was worthless. I turned it and the Iphone all the way up, and still the volume is super low. I gave it to my girlfriend and it works GREAT on her blackberry curve."
1,Terrible headset; people complain about the noise,Headset has quite bad microphone; people complain much more than with my old Motorola Headset about the voice quality and amount of noise. Not worth the price.
5,This is perfect for the PS3,"I have tried so many differnt blue tooth mics for my ps3 online gaming and i got nothing but headaches. I ended up getting a usb mic and well , it sucked for me cause I got 2 babies crawling and walking around, and they love to pull and yank on my mic cord.Well, after tons of aggrevation, I decided to get another bluetooth, cause I got friends that got one and they seemed not to have any problems. So to make a long story short,, I got this one and now I come to find out its probably the best one to get cause you dont have to keep on connecting it. Once you synch it up it stay connected,, and you dont ever have to worry bout starting the game over,, as a matter of fact, you can turn of the ps3 and it still connected."
2,Dont use it too much now.....,"I bought this item after seeing so many positive reviews primarily for using it while driving. Even though I myself do not ""hear"" any problems at my end, numerous times I have heard from the person at the other end that they could not hear me properly.I had been using a wired headset for so many years, and maybe my expectation was higher because of that.I also used the headset at home and at other times when just walking, and it has worked. Therefore, the headset did not serve the intended purpose of use while driving, although i still use it off and on.I have a Sprint Mogul phone. Maybe the bluetooth driver on that phone is not good - which could be part of the problem."
3,Exellent sound quality but very hard to use,"This product has the best sound quality I've experienced, hands down. However, it's ""single button"" usage makes it so confusing that I'm often having to look at my phone just to figure out if I'm making a call, transferring sound to phone, hanging up or in some other mode. So, as far as safety is concerned, I often think it makes me a less safe driver when I'm using it to make a call."
4,Good Connection but a bit bulky,"I've had this Headset for about a year and its impressed me in that I haven't lost it. The connection is clear and the signal is strong. The only thing about it that I lost one of the ear buds to it and now I have another one which is a bit uncomfortable, at least initially, but then you get used it. I would recommend this set because it's not too small and not too big."
4,Great sound quality,"This headset has great sound quality and the battery seems to last for a long time between charges. Setup was easy, and straightforward. The headset fit well and is light enough where it isn't uncomfortable. A little larger than other bluetooth headsets...but worth the money."
3,Worked ok for a year then magically stopped working for no reason,"Worked fine as a headset, though the behind the ear part is too bulky. I think the battery gave out, after only a little over a year. LAME. also, good luck using it in wind. Worked fine in the car / inside. Ended up replacing it with another headset, which also died. Yay. I love planned obselence."
4,So far so good,"I've been using this product for a few months now with my Nokia 6620 and mostly in the car. I bought it upon reading the good reviews about it and I agree with them. As opposed to the one I had before, I can hear people clearly and mostly people can hear me clearly as well. It connects to my phone automatically, which is convenient. Easy to charge and it lasts long. I just wish the speaker portion could come closer to my mouth so people could hear me more clearly and I wouldn't have to talk loudly at times."
4,Great Headset with one flaw,"Overall the best bluetooth headset I have tried, excellent noise rejection and very clear reception. The one issue is with the charging connection on the headset, + voltage receptical is a small pin which in my experience can be easily pushed in or disconnected, extreme care must be taken when connecting the power, other than that a great headset."
3,Not a good device to use while driving,"I am beginning to think that no Bluetooth headset works well in the noisy cockpit of a vehicle at highway speeds. I had an earlier Motorola headset that was effectively useless because people I was speaking with could not hear me. I thought that this Plantronics device, with its advertised noise-cancelling technology would be better. I was wrong. I have come to the conclusion that this device is only good for picking up my voice mails but not for live conversations."
2,"Poor Quality Control, mine was garbage","When I first recieved this item I was quite pleased with it. It was easy to set up, easy to use, and seemed reliable. Within two weeks however it began dropping calls and turning off frequently. This occured in spite of being fully charged, being within 3 feet of my phone, and my phones reception being perfect. A month later the speaker cover fell off and was lost. Now any background noise causes a hiss which makes it impossible for me to talk to people on it. Caveat Emptor if yours works then great but do expect it to fall to pieces.Edit-Cruddy quality control and dropping calls aside Plantronics has GREAT customer service. I contacted them via chat on their website and 2 days later a replacement speaker cover was on my porch. 2 star for poor craftsmanship but 1.5 for customer service- total new rating 3.5 stars."
5,The best I've ever had!,"I've had several blue tooth headsets. This is BY FAR the best. Comfort is great, I can hear the person on the other end and they can hear me even when walking down a busy street. Battery life seems great too. Can't say enough about this headset!"
3,Multi Point bluetooth,"My primary reason for buying this headset was the multipoint tech. I have two cell phones and had the need for one headset to handle both. So far the 510 is handling my needs. There are a couple of issues which may be more phone related than headset. Both phones are Motorola Razors. While using the headset to talk on one the other will disconnect, then reconect, disconnect, then reconect, making little noises during this process. Fortunately the person on the other end can not hear the noise. Every once in a while the headset seems to get overwhelmed and just turns off. This might not happen if I had two different types of phones. Of course the real solution is to have one cell phone that can handle two lines."
3,Better than other BlueTooth models but still not so great,"My husband got this so we could talk while he was driving. He previously had a different model BlueTooth headset and I hated that one because it was terrible that he always sounded like he was calling from inside a tin can and seemed to magnify all background noise. He got this model after we read about the ""noise cancelling technology"" and the good reviews here. He has a Blackberry cell phone. This headset is not that much better than his old one was. It still seems to magnify background noise. Additionally, his voice seems to come through at an even lower volume than when he talks on his cell phone without the headset. There is always so much noise that it's like he's calling from a tarmac next to a helicopter. All I can hear is all kinds of static-y noise like high winds. I'm only giving it three stars because at least it's better than the other model was."
4,Plantronics Voyager 510,The on and off button is a little awkward to find. Nice interchangeable pieces for different size ears. A little bulky behind my small ear. Very good Clarity.
3,"Great sound quality, BUT...","I can't get the thing to stay on my ear. I'm too frustrated with it, even though the sound quality is great."
3,How durable should a bluetooth headset be?,"I've had three of these in about 20 months. The first two stopped charging. I emailed Plantronics and they sent me one replacement. The earpiece now becomes loose very easily, and I've been lucky to avoid losing it. Enough.I replaced the 510 with a Jawbone Icon, ""The Hero,"" along with a box of Acoustibuds. The combination is a substantial improvement. I picked that Jawbone model because, according to the Amazon ratings, it seemed to suffer from less controversy than other Jawbone models. The sound quality and volume are much better and the speed of bluetooth connection and call connection seem faster. So far, so good.If 6-7 months is a respectable life for a bluetooth headset, then I would have to raise my star rating for the 510. The Jawbone is better, but more expensive."
2,I didn't like it,"I bought it and returned it two days later. I had to re-pair it everytime I wanted to use it, Sound was great, but out of all the headsets i've owned I never had to pair it after the original pairing"
2,A product who's quality has declined over the years...,"The quality of the Voyager 510 has declined over the past few years. I got two in 2007 and really liked them. Bottom line up-front: the earpiece speaker sound on the new ones becomes distorted once the volume is about half way up. At lower volumes it's not a problem, but get it to half way or above and the speaker sounds tinny and static-y. I still have one of my 2007 models and the side by side comparison to the new one is painfully obvious. It was so bad on the new one that I thought it was defective so I exchanged it for another: same problem. I'm very disappointed in what was once a great product."
1,Unhappy end-user,"I am going to have to send it back!!!!!The problem I've incountered is that I can hear the person I'm calling, however they cannot hear me. I checked with Plantronic,they said for me to send it back to Amazon or send it back to them.I haven't decided what I want to do, either way it's an inconvience.Unhappy Customer"
2,Disappointed,"This is the only bluetooth that has worked for me and had a comfortable fit. I drive a BIG truck and there is a lot of background noise. In the past its been the best. If you need to adjust the fit, it doesn't disconnect the call. Its always been great. For some reason this one crackles, cuts out (on both ends), loses signal often. There is obviously something wrong, but no time to deal with it now."
3,Good sound but takes forever to connect,"I use this bluetooth with my old Palm Treo. The sound quality is good both on my end and on the listener's end. I have never successfully figured out how to use the buttons on the bluetooth but that could just be me. I did want to warn people that it takes a really long time for the call to switch to the bluetooth, and frequently by the time it beeps and switches over, the person on the other end is saying, ""hello? hello? are you there?"" It's the only bluetooth I've used so I'm not sure if it's normal, but it's a bit annoying and not so professional."
2,"Good features, but not sturdy","So, my handy PL 510 is dying and I'm considering whether to get another.This thing has been on life support for months, after my toddler pulled it apart and chewed on the wires.""Not durable?"" you say, ""it wasn't designed as a teething toy!"". True, but it had been falling apart even before that, with the rubber outer covering chipping and ripping away. No abuse (other than the toddler), just day-to-day use.Great: battery life rocks. Good sound quality most times.Meh: Dang flashy blue light makes me look like a geek. Proprietary charger won't stay plugged in (have to set it just right and walk away slowly)."
2,"Ok sound quality, but it doesnt last long","The sound quality of the bluetooth is ok. If i use it during driving, my boyfriend even doesn't know im driving except im driving really fast on freeway. But it lasts for only several months."
3,VOYAGER 510,"I have used this headset for approximately two weeks and already the blue connected light has stopped flashing and I can no longer tell when I have connected to my mobile phone.This was to be a backup for when my first one quit, I am very disappointed, it still does an excellent job of filtering out wind noise."
4,Close to perfect for these things,"This product is probably as good as these things get. I think Bluetooth as a technology generally sucks no matter what brand of headset you buy. So far, it has performed better than any I've owned so far. It has better sound quality, resistance to wind noise and is hardier than the two Motorola's I've had. It fits better, too. It's a little too easy to hang up on people when your messing with your hair or whatever, but you'll get used to it and stop doing it after a couple of days. You might thing that it looks a little big and not entirely stylish, but that's a judgment call, right? Personally, I'm happy to have something that's close to working the way that these things are supposed to work."
4,Great little earpiece,"Had this headset for a couple weeks now, and its great. Better than expected battery life, clean and crisp sound. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was that I can't listen to my music over the bluetooth. But was definitely worth the money."
2,Uncomfortable with glasses,"If you wear glasses most of the time like I do, this headset will not be comfortable for you. In fact, I couldn't keep it on without constantly adjusting it. So the sound was not good. I sent it back for a Sony over-the-head headset."
2,plantronics 510,The ear speaker sounds like a broken speaker. It worked fine for about a month. I have had several of this model in the past with good results.
4,"Well designed product, good sound quality","The Voyager 510 has worked very well for me thus far. I use it frequently when working at home or when driving. I have a quiet voice and frequently got 'complaints' to speak louder with other bluetooth models. With the Voyager, I don't get this complaint anymore.Pro:- Better audio quality than previous devices- On/Off switch is NOT easily engaged. Other models turned on too easily.- The fit for me is perfect, I don't feel like it's always ready to fall off- Definitely worth the price paid.Con:- Another unique (for me) connection for charging"
3,GOOD PRODUCT EXEPT FOR,"I PURCHASED THE PLANTRONICS VOYAGER 510 BASED ON THE GOOD REVIEWS AND MUST SAY IT DOES LIVE UP TO ITS EXPECTATIONS...CLEAR SOUND, NOBODY KNOWS THAT IM ON IT WHILE IM SPEAKNG TO THEM...ALTHOUGH I'VE ONLY USED IT ABT 5 TO 6 TIMES (ONLY WHEN I DRIVE FOR LONG PERIODS)..THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT THE MICROPHONE COVER CRACKED AND CRUMBLED FROM BEING INSIDE MY POCKETBOOK... I CANT TELL HOW THAT HAPPEND I KEEP MY KEYS INSIE MY COAT POCKET AND I DONT RECALL EVER BUMPING INTO SOMETHING.IF ANYONE PLANS ON PURCHASING THIS BT HDSET BE CAREFUL, THAT MICROPHONE COVER IS VERY DELICATE. I HAVE A PIECE OF TISSUE AND RUBBERBAND TO KEEP IT FRM GETTNG DAMAGED."
4,Well worth the price!,"An excellent, handy guide for those interested in basic Ukrainian. My husband is a native speaker and this is a great help in my beginning attempts at conversation. I have tried several other books, and tapes but this one gets you going immediately."
4,Excellent book but hard pronnounciation.,Yhis is an excellent phrasebook for those intrested in learning the ukrainian language quick and easy.It is also a good travel book if you are visiting Ukraine.The only flaw in this book is that the pronounciation is somewhat difficult and it will take a little work to pronounce the words corectly.I highly reccomend this book.
4,Worthy Read,"The book is full of interesting details and sidelines, yet it also allows the reader to glean broader patterns of social history."
4,Recommended for circus fans and political biography buffs.,"Dan Rice: The Most Famous Man You've Never Heard Of is the fascinating and informative biography of a circus man whose fame became so great (seen as he was by more Americans of the time than just about anyone else) that at one point he ran for presidency of the United States. This compelling and superbly presented biography traces the life of Dan Rice, his rise in the public eye and the reasons behind his eventual descent into total obscurity. An amazing cultural history of America in the mid-eighteenth century as well as a close personal look at one flamboyant man who struggled through the roiling times, Dan Rice: The Most Famous Man You've Never Heard of is a biography especially recommended to circus buffs, as well as students of 19th century American life, culture, and politics!"
3,Not the same as the hardback,I ordered this for my husband becuz all his friends had it and were ranting and raving about it. I give it to him and he is really stoked and calls his brother to talk about some famous car in it. Well this is when we find out there is a big difference between the hardback and the paperback. The paperback doesn't have all the pictures in it that the hardback does. Very disappointing for my husband.
1,Don't waste your time,"Sorry, I got sucked into this because I was desperate for something to watch, should have read a book."
2,What A Stinker,"I gave it 2 stars because the horses are beautiful but they do not compensate for the lack of any real mystery or plot. The ""love"" scenes are contrived. Bruce Greenwood with his shirt off and his hair in his eyes washing a horse with the sunlight glinting off of his chest hair is just silly. Buy Last of the Dogmen if you are looking for mystery, love, dogs, horses, Indians and a chic flick even guys like."
2,Okie during the 1940s,"The author is angry about her backgroud. Her anger is very apparent in the style of writing. It is always interesting to read something from an author with a strong view point, such as the communist, socialist view. This book was used as a textbook in a family history class. Several students in the class have family members from the OK, MO, KS, TX area. How different the viewpoints and memories. We would like to read a family history from Dunbar-Ortiz's family member that became a veterinarian or from her other family members."
3,FAIR,"I guess, for the price, this is alright. Not, very adventurous. I'm beginning to think people ought to just leave Motown alone. Nobody can really recapture the magic."
3,"5 for concept, 2 for execution","Pooh's Five Honey Pots rates a 5 for the originality of its concept - affixing 5 sliding plastic pots on an arc at the top of the book, so preschoolers can count along with Pooh and his friends while pushing each one to the opposite side. The story, however, is little more than turning pages as Pooh downs the honey 5 times in a row. Simplistic, greeting card style verses repetitiously accompany the illustrations, and this is the part that could have been much better. Not a bad book, just an ordinary one, except for those cute little pots."
1,The seller was great but....,The seller's response was speedy enough but the quality of the purse was far less than I expected. It looks much more substantial in the photo than it is.
3,It's a Scream-fest!,"Unfortunately, this is my least favorite Leap Pad Book --- The screaming of the characters really gets on my nerves. Leap Pad has many other books that are enjoyable to play."
4,Monstera Inc,My son loved the movie so he just got sucked into the game on a 4 hour car ride it kept him busy for about 1 1/2 hours.
5,Great blanket,My granddaughter really loves it. She uses it every day and brings it with her when she comes to visit.
2,Disappointed,"The quality of the blanket is cheap. It's like a piece of printed material. I was very disappointed. The person that I gave it to was excited that it had gymnastics on it, but as far a warmth goes....unsatisfactory."
4,Sisterly Love.,I liked this movie. My only criticism is that Rick Springfield was a little over the top. How interesting it would be to have an exact twin to step into your life and make things right.
4,Change of Place,"This is a romance for a quiet afternoon, with good acting and a simple story. The plot is no surprise, but still nice."
1,My greatest shame in life...,"... was not when I saw the 3 Stooges 50 years ago (I didn't know a thing about them at this time), but when I realized I was sharing a planet where (not so human) living beings could get entertainment from garbage only fit for braindeads finding usual TV crap too much intellectual and lacking excessive vulgarity. To watch this as some study experiment might be understandable, to enjoy it should be subjected to institutionalization."
5,Great Information,This book is a great resource for beginners and advanced chicken lovers. There is a lot of great information and it's worded in a way that normal people can understand it!
4,The Chicken Health Handbook,I purchased this book for my sister for a Christmas present and she was very happy with the gift. She is a hooby chicken farmer and thought that this book would be a great help understanding chicken illnesses.
3,The Chicken Health Handbook,The book was very well written and will make a good resource book for illnesses.
4,Chicken Health Handbook,"This is a very practical handbook, both for backyard poultry keeping as well as for commercial poultry farmers. It is quite complete in the various health aspects, with excellent drawings and overviews. It is well updated in technical information. Excellent value for a very nice price."
5,Excellent Reference,This reference is a must have for anyone raising chickens. The author goes into great detail on problems that might affect a chickens health.
3,Hoped for more user-friendly information,"Although there is no doubt that the author is very knowledgeable on her subject, I found the book not very user friendly.It was purchased with the intent of having a guide to go to when I had health issues with my chickens. There is much information that is technical and unless one wants to study it and try to commit information to memory, it is not a quick reference guide in emergencies.I also found that many of the medications recommended for treatment of a problem I took time to diagnose, were unavailable; thus rendering the information useless at the time I needed it the most.Although disappointed, I am unaware of any other current options for chicken health books; I give it a three star rating due to the vast knowledge given."
5,A great book to have around !!,I will be 13 next month and we have about 30 to 40 full size cickens and 10 bantams and when ever I have a qestion I always rent this book because it is so basic and has so much information !! it has stuff about chicks all the way up to full grown and between .
5,The Waltons Season 2,I have shared the viewing of this beautiful series with my two young children and it is a wonderful bonding and sharing time for us. They learn and I reminisce. Absolutely fabulous!!!!
4,Prompt delivery and . . .,This item made it promptly after being ordered. It is a Christmas gift so it will be a while before it is opened and enjoyed. I can only assume it is the same high quality as was experienced in the first season of DVDs.
5,The best WALTONS season ever!,"This is the best season of the best show ever on TV! The technical quality of these DVD's is truly astounding, just superb!! I could just watch these episodes over and over, especially the ""Ghost Story"" episode! This series such a powerful and amazing show! I really hope that all the other WALTONS seasons get released soon!"
3,Walton's 2nd Season,"The Walton's 2nd Season DVD was overall very good, with the exception of a few episodes that the color was lighter and more pale and was not as good as the 3rd Season which I purchased out of a store."
3,Family Stories,This is a classic series of family life in the 1930's. Wonderful stories the whole family can watch. The actors play there characters with so much enthusiasm so it wraps you into their lives in the depression era.
4,LACK OF BONUS MATERIAL KEEPS ME FROM RATING THIS GREAT SHOW 5 STARS,"This show is great,but with most of cast still alive its a shame they can't get some of them together for some inside information and other bonus material for these season sets. One of the best seasons though."
5,Love the Waltons,"My grandmother introduced me to the Waltons back during the 70s, while the seasons were first aired, and I liked it. While I think the ""Good Night"" scenes at the end of each episode are a bit corny, I especially like the grandmother Ellen Corby, and her strong temper. She's the star of the show IMO, with grandpa not too far behind. Each episode is another story from the depression times in Virginia, mostly involving the family and community. And they are interesting. I also recommend watching the Homecoming, which is a Christmas story that inspired the series. It's hard to pick a favorite episode, but if I had to it would be ""The First Day"", John Boy's first day at college. And ""The Car "" when John boy works for his first car."
4,"wholesome, clean shows","I am glad to have been able to purchase The Walton's complete second season. It was offered at an affordable price and I've had it only three days now and am viewing the 2nd dvd. I have to say that everything appears as it should. The theme song is the real thing, the color, quality are all worth the price."
5,Just as expected,The 4 Fruit design plates were just as expected. The plates and quality matched the description and the picture. It arrived just as promised.
2,Do not buy this book -- info is already in every other cat behavior book,"I came to this book wanting veterinarian-type insights into the fascinating behavior of my cats. I was beyond the average books, and wanted more! Although this book has lots of fancy words, the actual information is not anywhere near insightful. In fact I knew most of the information from another behavior book I had read. The research is horribly out of date, and who knows what exciting new findings have come up in the past 20 years -- certainly not Dr. Beaver. I am a researcher and writer myself in another area, and this is just unforgivable."
3,Motion sensor didn't work but it's still an upgrade,"The motion sensor didnt work on my 1995 lift master. I read up on it before purchasing to make sure I bought the right one, but despite it saying it should work- it doesn't. If I was more diligent I would return it. Easy installation if you have the existing wires from the opener. Lights on the push button make it nice to find in the dark (wouldn't be necessary if the motion sensor worked)."
4,LiftMaster 98LM,"Not much to say! This is a nice ""add-on"" for an opener. Turns the light on when one enters the sensor (infrared, I believe) area. Selectable ""on"" time.Had one of these for a number of years. The motion sensing segment malfunctioned...stayed ""on"" all the time. Bought a new one...good price! Got it fast, hooked it up...problem solved! :)Only reason for ""4 Stars"" is failure of identical unit, which has no relays, no moving parts. Just...failed! :("
1,Pure Junk. Turns on without any movement!,"I didn't heed the bad reviews of others and purchased this item. Worked for about 30 days and then the light started coming on by itself. Mind you, a sealed garage, no pets, no ventilation and doors alarmed and yet to walk out to my car parked in the driveway in the morning and to see the two 100w bulbs in the garage door opener glowing away, presumable all night, it's extremely frustrating.Please look elsewhere for the switch because this one will only cause you anger and frustration."
5,Best so far,"I found this handheld device to be one of the best so far. With its new Xscale PXA255 CPU, the speed is amazing (nearly doubled in some tasks) and it also uses about 30% less battery power (1.3V instead of 1.5V for PXA250). The new 3.8"" transflective LCD makes it the largest and one of the best screens in the U.S. Market (not including e550G from Toshiba Japan. The reflective LCD screen was one of the major draw-backs for the e740.) To correct viking632, the e750 has 64MB RAM + 32MB NANO RAM + 32MB for the OS. Most of the issues e740 had (1% battery, ActiveSync drop) have been resolved for the e750/755. With the added value of Wireless LAN, USB, (VGA with expansion pack) and removable battery, this is the BEST Pocket PC in the US market right now (Q1 2003). Highly recommend!"
1,Wireless Lan Utility Error,"After only a few days use, the Wireless Lan stopped functioning and I recieved an error of ""ENUM Interface Failed"". I called customer service at Toshiba only to be told that ""this is a known problem and a software fix will be available in the future"". Well the future can be a LONG, LONG time. From the number of used e755's for sale on E-bay, I don't think I am the only disatisfied customer!It is no wonder that the price is dropping on this model!"
5,Toshiba out front,"Toshiba are the industry leader. This machine is fast, the screen is great, and the memory is completely serviceable. It gets an enum failure error which requires a soft restart from time to time, but it is fully functional, top-of-the-line. I will be upgrading to the 805."
2,"E755 is bad for Gaming, bad buttons!","You cannot press more than one button at a time, so this makes playing any kind of game impossible. This is especially unforgivable since this was a major failing of the e740, an earlier Toshiba unit. If you do not like to play games, and firmly belive you never will, then this is the pocket pc for you. However, if you think you might ever play a game on you pocket pc, avoid this one like it has SARS. My three year old palm pilot is better for games than this thing.However, besides gaming, this unit has it all, wifi, lots of memory, a fast processor an every option except for good buttons...its a shame because for me that means I have a expensive paper weight."
2,"If you are used to Palm, forget it",Over all it appears to be a good machine. However I returned it three days after I purchased it. I'm used to Palm so that may be the reason but I found it big and clunkie and slow compared to the Palm. Also it was fairly unstable with an interface that was not intuitive. I ran it side by side with a Tungsten C and at that point returned the Toshiba and bought the Palm. If you are used to PPCs you'll problably love it but if you are used to Palm I really don't think it's worth the money and the Palm is just a much better machine with a better OS.
4,"Not just the two ""sides"" or a salad","The nice thing about Verdura is that it has everything-- Antipasti, Salads, Grilled Breads/Sandwiches, Soups, Pasta, Rice/Polenta, Main Dishes, Sides, and Desserts--featuring vegetables cooked the Italian way.Other than the Chinese, I think the Italians have the best feel for how to bring out what's wonderful in a vegetable. I love the cauliflower with lemon dressing in particular, and the squash recipes as well.The pizza basic recipe is really great. We made it last night and it came out so well. (We did use a pizza stone, which really makes a difference.) Next time we will try the Arugula version of the pizza. Arugula is a pungent green, looking a bit like dandelion leaves and it not only tastes great, it is really good for you."
4,great cookbook - note this is the British version tho,"I love this cookbook. A friend gave it to me and I've used it and enjoyed it over the years.This year, I decided to give this book to a family member for his birthday. I mulled over giving the paperback or the hardback version and I elected to go with the hardback because I thought he'd use it a lot. I gave the one with the artichoke in the white ""colander"" on the cover:VERDURA: Vegetables Italian Style (hardcover published by Grub Street Cookery).When I gave the gift, they asked me for my favorite recipe in the book. When I went to point it out -- I was a little surprised to see that my favorite recipe called for courgettes instead of zucchini and rocket instead of arugula. This copy is the BRITISH version, which is perfectly understandable except when it isn't.I would recommend the version of the book I have over the one I gaveVERDURA: Vegetables Italian Style (hardcover published by Ecco).Be aware."
5,My daughter loves it!,My 2 year old daughter dances and sings to it and even tries to say the animals names! She's watched it so many times-I'm glad it's a DVD!
1,Don't even rent this one!,"What a piece of crap! This is a wanna be porno, but doesn't even make the cut there. Nothing but a serious waste of time here. Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. One star is too generous."
1,Cheaply made and poorly written,"I just rented this video expecting something a little campy and fun. This thing was an abomination. The acting was terrible and the writing was substandard at best. It was so disjointed and bizarre. No character developement. It seemed as though the whole of the movie was flimsy bridge to make it to the final act in the cabin which, I admit, was hot but soon got very boring. It seemed like this director was really wanting to do porn more than anything else. The sad part was I saw great potential, but it was all so terribly wasted."
2,Arrived broken,"Packaging seemed perfect, however 1 glass was shattered. When I called customer service they requested photo proof of broken glass. I never got around to it. So they get this review for not accepting my word."
1,One month past and still don't have it!!!!,"The book actually is pretty good and I know this because I had to purchase it somewhere else. I ordered the book on 8/18/09 and I still don't have it. The response I received when looking for the book was ""it was being sent media mail and was within its delivery date"". I order online alot and have never heard of this type of shipping, especially a book. I am assuming it is in someone's backpack and they are walking it across the country to deliver it to me personally. I ordered two other books at the same time and received them within the week. I will not order from this source again. I will be sending the book back as soon as it hits my doorstep and not via media mail."
4,Nice Grain on Cedar Post & Arm,The Cedar Post and Arm that I received had a unique wood pattern which looked nice. The anchor that was included was of poor design and I discarded it. I went down to my local hardware store and bought a sturdy anchor that the 4 X 4 post set into and clamped tight around the post. It made the post more solid and sturdy compared to using the anchor that came with the kit. If it was not for the flimsy anchor that came with the kit I would have given this item 5 stars.
5,Tale of a hungry fish and a little girl who rescues him.,"This book is so wonderful that I cannot imagine it being out of print. It is a rhyming story and my children loved it so much that all 3 of them, now in their 20's can still chant it all when they are having fun. My oldest daughter has asked me to get it for her new baby. The story has a message regarding a hungry fish being bullied by ducks and swans,girl falls in pond, fish rescues girl, girl feeds hungry fish. Pictures are bright primary colors. Children love this story and so do I. Please find one for me."
5,Cornerstones of Theory and Practice,"Investors in general and beginning investors in particular are largely ignorant of the works of perhaps the most important men they could read, one of whom is Justin Mamis (another is Richard Wyckoff). This is due at least in part to the fact that most of the works of these two men have been out of print for so long. But three of Mamis' works are now back (cross your fingers for When To Buy, the only one still out of print) and increased profits are a virtual guarantee for anyone who takes advantage of this opportunity to obtain these foundation works and commit their lessons in strategy to his own plan for trading and investment.Very highly recommended and cheap at the price."
3,Overrated,"I am relatively new to trading and I have read a bunch of books and have a pile of unread ones that I still need to work my way through. I was eager to read this Mamis book because of the almost unanimously glowing reviews.The actual work, however, did not live up to its reputation. In the mid-70s, this might have been a brilliant treatise on the market. In the 90s, the second edition might have been worth reading. But today there are, as the previous reviewer mentioned, much better books to choose from. Stan Weinstein bought Mamis' business from him. I would recommend Weinstein's book above Mamis's. Sure, Weinstein might have had the benefit of coming after Mamis. This is no way oppugns Mamis. But, if I want to learn calculus, I am not going to read Newton or Leibniz in the original. Likewise, today we can read Stan Weinstein, Mebane Faber, and others who have taken Mamis's salient ideas and structured them into a more coherent form."
1,Story Teller,"I think it's a novel about some studya cases. Beside the awful graphs (it's not that important if there would be good information, but it is not the case) the author just become a story teller.I have read a lot of good books (from Elder, Marcel Link, John Murphy, Mark Douglas, Peter Linch, John Carter)but this is very bad one. I finished becuase every book I start to read I have to finish anyway.I know nothing about the author, may be he's good investor, trader and writer but this book is not good at all."
1,"Comments on ""MEDITATIONS FROM THE ROAD""",I was disappointed in the meditations. They consisted only of exerts from the author's books. I was hoping for personal thoughts form the author on each exert. I would not recommend this book as a source of thought for meditations.
4,Hot!!,"Kieran is so hot!!!! I love the album, especially Let's Get Away, Breathe and Missing You. R U Awake is amazing too. I definitely recommend this cd."
1,Another medicore CD from a talentless R&B singer,"Kieran is another singer with no promising value. I would expect since the CD featured production from Johnta Austin and Scott Scorch the CD would have been somewhat decent, however it's not and it's no wonder why his carrer went nowhere."
3,Decent effort.......,"He's new to the scene and trying to make a name for himself...there are definitely a few cuts on this ablum that will accomplish that. Not the best cd by far but not the worst either. He has a lot of potential and room to grow. There is about 4 songs that I'm am really feelin' on this album, everything else is filler tracks. One thing I really feel is lacking on this album is song material....which most album these days are. Mostly about relationships and everything surrounding that. There's really not much more I can say about it, the few songs that I like are not enough for me to recommend someone to buy the album. I would say take a real good listen first before you buy, as I was on the border line and just wanted something new, so I got it. But don't expect greatness, just a nice effort."
1,irishploitation,"We heard Nollaig Casey, fiddler and Arty McGlynn not too long ago in Coepnhagen playing two beautiful acoustic sets of Irish music. On this record they do the same except it's all drowned in studio washes of conventional, contemporary pop music ranging from new-age Enyaism to blah-rock. Casey's beautiful vocals are not trusted by the studio so soulful new-age echo (oh, those lonesome Irish moors!) is added. Musicians are credited with playing instruments on the record. Perhaps. A synthesizer might have produced the same sounds. An unimaginative, unambitious record. Shame on all the people involved!"
4,Never heard of before...,"...that is until I began watching what has got to be one of the most awful campy, cheesy zombie flicks of all time, ""Zombie Honeymoon"". So naturally I had to watch the entire movie to behold it's crimes against cinema and the zombie genre. A delicious agony to be sure. Anyway, Maw and Paw did not even get a mention by IMDB or any other resource I searched for. A blogger by the name of Adam Tyner (tyner@wittydomainname.net) was kind enough to provide the entire soundtrack to the movie. I found Maw and Paw to be rather enjoyable to listen to. Kinda sounds like someone else but I can't put my finger on who. Amazon.com does not list all their music so go to their MySpace page: ([...]. In my humble opinion they are really rather good."
4,Very good slowcooker cookbook.,The recipes in this cookbook are easy and healthy. The only reason I gave this cookbook 4 stars is due to the fact that the recipes are primarily for a 3 1/2 quart or 4 quart slow cooker. I prefer to use a larger slow cooker since I like to freeze part of the meal.
4,Slow Cooker deluxe!!!,"Probably not for everyone....although saying that I love this book. This has some fantastic recipes in it, amazing tastes. If you have a slow cooker just to throw things into and turn it on this isn't for you... However if like me, you enjoy cooking and don't mind a little extra time to make a simply succulent dish this is the one."
4,For the gourmet or foodie with a slow cooker,"The slow cooker is another kitchen tool. I noted that several of the previous reviewers criticized this book for being too difficult and requiring too much work. I disagree. Delicious, richly-flavored food will take some effort. In the case of Mr. Rodgers' recipes, the effort is minimal and definitely worth it when you taste the results. This was a wonderful cookbook for me because it provided many ways to use the slow cooker as a tool to maximize flavor and minimize prep time. I learned how to use the slow cooker as a bain marie from this book.This book is NOT for those who want to throw all the ingredients into the slow cooker, plug it in, and then return to the resulting gruel."
2,Pot Size Matters!,"I received a nice, 6 quart slow cooker for Christmas, and ordered this book for it as I wanted recipes a bit more than ""dump in one pot."" Well, I wish the description had mentioned that nearly all recipes in this book are for a 3.5 quart slow cooker! And it emphasizes how using the right size pot is important. As I'm not going out to buy yet another slow cooker, this book is a big disappointment for me."
2,very time consuming set up.,"If I wanted to be that complex I would forget the slow cooker, and just cook the traditional way. This book is a disappointment. Most of the recipes sound great, but my schedule doesn't really permit me to spend two hours prepping then have everything the crock pot with 8 hours slow cooking time then another 30 minutes of hands on prep before dinner. This book needs another title. It's title is deceiving. These are not meals that cook themselves."
4,Count the prep time,"The prep time for the Indonesian Stew (I used chicken, not veal) with Coconut and Peanuts took me about an hour probably because I doubled the receipe as I was using a 6 quart cooker. I couldn't find unsweetened coconut so I used author's suggestion and rinsed mine with hot water. That also accounted for some of the prep time. The results were excellent, however. And the leftovers were even better. Note - don't eat the raw peanuts until they're cooked!I want to try the Daube de Boeuf and that one takes 3 days of prep time!"
5,A Surprisingly Wonderful Cookbook,"I bought this book not expecting it to be as good as the reviews I read here. After all, I couldn't imagine yet another crockpot cookbook to be different from the 6 other crockpot cookbooks I own...but I was wrong. The first dish I tried, Bistro Beef Bourguignon, was simply fabulous (even my fussy teenage son liked it) and our house was filled with the most mouthwatering aroma.I agree with the other reviewers that you'll spend a fair amount of time putting everything together before you actually create the finished product, but it's time well spent. Too, you'll probably need to cook these recipes on the weekend, as they're not of the throw-everything-in-the-pot-and-walk-away kind. If you enjoy cooking and eating truly wonderful meals, this is the best book of its kind out there."
1,Crockery Cookbook,"I returned this book I was so disappointed with it. It is not the prep times before or after preparing a dish, that is to be expected with anything you cook unless you pull a frozen dinner out of a package. It was the overly done up recipes, sounding too much like fine gourmet cooking. I want down home, tasty, simpler recipes, meaning ingredients I normally have on hand and ones my whole family will eat without begging. I have other crockpot cookbooks I much prefer like the America's Best Slow Cooker recipes and Pillsbury's One Dish cookbook, these being my favorites of all crockery cooking books."
1,worst book ever on crock pot cooking,"I have never seen a collection of recipes before that are so unappealing. What the author calls sumptuous meals I would call really groce. What about Beef Bourguignon where we use NO french herbs whatsoever, just half a cup of red wine per 2 pounds of beef and Mr Rodgers wants us to cook the mushrooms and the broiling onions for 7 to 8 hours. I mean, REALLY? Well, the book is old and there is a reason why the price is only 47 cents these days. It is not even worth that amount."
1,Not home town cooking.,"I have a family who likes the very basics, meat, potatoes, very basic vegi's like corn...and corn...so it just wasn't the recipe book for us..."
5,"WOW, for Beet","I really think Beet is great, I loved it. I got it for my birthday and my friends like it just as much as I do. I saw that the guy that is the producer is the same guy that did a bunch of my dragon ball z vids, great job, keep them coming!!!"
4,HE SHOULD STAY A BACHELOR!,"Good story but THAT MAN needed a swift kick! He cheated on her after she refused to leave with him when they were in high school. He became a work-a-holic to ""prove"" himself. Each time they were together, he'd display his jealous streak or have a temper tantrum if the heroine didn't agree with him about something. In the first love scene, he got a phone call from his foreman and just completely tuned her out. If some man jumped out of bed like that and left me cold, he'd never get back in! Even though they ended up together, I can forsee problems in this relationship."
3,Too short of time using product to judge,I am giving this a shot because I have heard so much about using these products. I think one needs to give something like this several months to give it an honest review.
5,Great product,"I used Culturelle for years and then switched to see what else was out there. At the time I didn't like having to go to the pharmacy to get it. It was always stored behind the pharmacy window, even though was an over the counter drug. I did find something comparable to it but was very expensive. It has been years of trying other probiotics and nothing really compares to it.. I love it!"
5,100% satisfied,bought this for my 5yo son who was having a lot of digestive issues. His DAN doctor recommended this brand. In less than a week we were back to having normal bm's. NOTE- he also takes a digestive enzyme aid. I like that I can open and pour onto applesauce since he isn't into swallowing pills yet. I have everyone in my family taking these now. 70% of our immune system is in our GI tract so let's take care of it.
3,Its ok,"I really needed the enzymes along with a probiotic... This just help part of the issue. If this doesn't cure your issue, try enzymes and eliminate gluten and processed foods from your diet."
3,"it,s ok","It's ok,but did not improve a lot my condition with abdominal pain ,gas ,indigestion,diarrhea,ect.this is one of most studied probiotic bacteria ,but we have in our gut more then 450 spiecies ,so this one is only one positive added to gut,we need something more wide spread to help people with those symptoms,but this one is still ok ( on the top after Florastore)"
1,' not helpful',"I had used this product before, during, and after the use of antibiotics - 'It was not in any way helpful!"
2,Beware of vender but good product,"I have used the product before so let me begin by saying that the product itself is great. The negative review is for the vender. If you purchase from Amazon, make sure it is not the DAB unlimited third party vendor.When I finally received the packed two week after ordering, it was crammed into my mailbox in a tiny plastic bag. The product was crushed and flattened AND it was the wrong product (different type of probiotic). A quarter of the pills were near powder. When contacting the vender, they never responded. I filed a claim and the vender finally responded after two weeks. By this time Amazon already refunded my money."
1,Must be kept below 75 degrees,"I ordered this product online. It arrived on a 70-80 degree day in the spring. The package says ""Refrigeration recommended"" and ""Must be kept below 75 degrees"". I'm betting that it warmed up over 80 degrees in the UPS truck on the way over to my house. I'd recommend ordering this product only in the cooler weather months. I'm afraid I received a dead product and have not bothered taking it since I know it was exposed higher temperatures than stated on the packaging. I'll buy locally next time - I have a grocer that refrigerates products like this.<Update 7/30/2010>I'm updating this review since I added an image to the product page in response to Toni's comment ""I do not see any indication of refrigeration being required"". The back of the box clearly shows what I say above. Maybe Toni was unable to read the fine print."
5,GOOD SOURCE FOR GOOD PRODUCT,"THIS WAS MY 2ND SHIPMENT OF THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SOURCE, AND ""SO FAR, SO GOOD"". THE PRICE IS VERY COMPETITIVE....MUCH BETTER THAN MY LOCAL PHARM, THE SERVICE FAST AND THE MEDS FRESH."
2,Absolutely No Results - Positive or Negative,"I have been taking Culturelle every morning for 30 days and have seen no improvement in my frequent bouts of digestion problems. That being said, I am giving this product two stars because even though I haven't seen any positive effects, I also haven't had any of the frequently described side effects. It just didn't have any effect at all.It seems that this probiotic isn't the right one for me so I will be switching to a different (and less expensive) product."
2,gave me a bad stomachache,"Purchased for my IBS. After only 1 week of using it had very bad headaches and stomachaches. I just ""felt funny"". Threw in garbage, within a day all symptoms went away. I'd rather eat yogurt."
5,Recommended to me by my doctor,I was perfectly happy with this purchase & good price! This product was recommended to me by my doctor at Mayo Clinic because I will be taking several antibiotics for many months for a serious disease .. this will help with oral thrush and yeast infections!
5,culturelle probiotics,Culturelle probiotics have helped my digestive problems for the past 2 years. I think all Americans should be taking this product- especially those who have recently taken antibiotics.
3,Didn't help much,"I purchased this item in hopes of decreasing the ""bloaty"" feeling that I often have in my abdominal area. I took it religously every day for 2 months and did not notice any change. Considering the cost of this product and the ""minor"" thing that I was trying to treat, it wasn't worth it. However, as a health-care worker, I believe it may have benefit for some people out there and could well be worth the cost."
5,Culturelle supplement,We take this supplement regularly. It is especially good after taking a course of antibiotics. The seller sent the product very quickly and in good condition at a great price.
5,An Exceptional Telling of a forgotten American Drama,"To be brief; I read this book when it first came out in hardback. I found the story to be both compelling and inspiring. This book reinforced my sense that the curriculum setting process in american public education is so narrowly focused as to create cohort after cohort of ill informed and historically ignorant citizens. Stories such as this would inspire our children to take an interest in history and to provide a framework for them to understand the political, economic and social ties that make this country what it is. Context is everything. This book is all about context.After reading this marvelous story as told by an exceptionally talented story teller I went on to read every one of her books. I cherish my copy of this book and wish that it had received wider circulation."
4,The Dubliners as geezers!,"Now,anyone who dosen't like this collection is an idiot.But anyone who likes it just for what seems to be the featured song,""The Rose"",is a bigger idiot.I recommend ""The Pool Song"",""The Sands of Sudan"",""Barley and Grape Rag"",""Death of the Bear"",""Phil the Fluters Ball"",""A Wee Touch Of Paper and Paint,But then Again Maybe That's Me"",""Will the Circle be Unbroken"",""Deportees"",""Dan Murphy's Door"",""I'm A Man You Don't Meet Everyday"",""Mancester Rambly Guy"",and best of all,""Whiskey in the Jar""."
5,"Wonderful, Faithful Version of Ausen's Work",The performances of Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant make this rendition of Sense and Sensibility. This is my favorite version of this work by Austen. The absolute best! Buy it!
4,Headsets in general,I like this headset a lot. It isn't perfect but it is good. It picks up noise from in front too much to be a four star review but it is comfortable and does work well.
1,I was told i was going to get a refund but never did,This product is awful!.It ruined my Levis skinny jeans.I was then told i was going to get a refund and never did.Horrible seller DONT BUY!!.The tye dye was gray and it turned my jeans BROWN.
1,Brown NOT Grey!,"I would give this no stars if possible! The package says it is GREY dye, but it is NOT. I dyed a white cotton shirt and it came out brown. It isn't even a shade of brown that is close to grey, it is BROWN BROWN BROWN. If you want grey clothing (like I did) DO NOT use tintex grey fabric dye!!!"
3,Evil Incarnate,"This Emperor Palpatine figure was part Kenner's 12"" Star Wars Action Collection line. Kenner's figures aren't the works of art that the later Sideshow figures are, but I really enjoyed collecting the `90s 12"" figure line.Pros - The Emperor figure is pretty well detailed, especially his face and hands. His robe is well done too.Cons - The hood of the Emperor's robe is sewn onto his head. There's just no reason for that. His gnarled cane is a pretty lame accessory too. Some snap-on ""force lightning"" would have been a better addition.It's not the best of the Action Collection figures, but your collection really isn't complete without this master of evil.NOTE - Emperor Palpatine was previously available in an exclusive 2-pack that also included a 12"" Imperial Guard."
4,Pretty good!,"This movie's setting is in the 1970's, but it is still good. Yasaku is sexy & ruthless, and it has a good surprise ending."
2,Too Little and Too Basic for QA Engineers,"Although this book provides you some basic insights about customer-oriented quality assurance concepts, it offers too little and too primitive basics for someone who want to learn solid software QA basics, processes, methods, and metrics, and standards, and quality systems. It does not provide fundamentalbasics for you to learn how to work and perform as a SQA engineer."
3,A book only addressing QA from a customer view,"I am an instructor who trains software QA and test engineers.After reading this book, I got an impression that this is a very basic book addressing product quality factors andattributes from the customer perspective. In addition, the author also touches the other SQA topics, such as processes,and CMM and ISO. However, these topics are covered withoutdetails.If you are looking for a book offering details about know how to be a good SQA engineer, or how to solve the detailed SQAissues of a project, product, or an organization,then this is not the right one. However, if you are looking fora book addressing a customer's view of software product quality.then, this book offers you the information in informative way."
2,Disappointed,"I have not finished the book. I have just finished chapter 16, but to this point I am disappointed. Instead of identifying some of man's sin struggles, all responsibility has been put on the church. The church is all wrong and men are just right the way that they are.I can't believe all of the scriptural values that are made fun of and thrown to the wayside. I wouldn't be suprised if the fruit of the Spirit are thrown out next for being not ""manly""Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.These are the kinds of things that the author claims to be not masculine. I can only hope it gets better, but I won't get my hopes up."
2,A bit narrow,"The book has some good principles at the end about the needs of men. But, it is terrible in application and simplifies things so much so. I think it could cause another worship war. The publishers are probably glad for the ""shockjock"" type tone. I am not. What about hispanic or other cultures? The author really did not think too well about how diverse our nation is and did not acknowledge that he sees beyond a white-middle class culture.Besides the negative, I do think he brings out a very important discussion. I just wish he was more culturally aware since he most likely is preaching to a choir that already hates anything that is too creative and is looking for validation."
4,Some excellent points,"I don't know that I agree with everything the author has to say, but he makes some excellent points. I think the hardest part is getting the clergy to acquiese to these ideas. I don't know any off hand who could actually pull this off. The ideas however are very pertinent and if the church could do this I think we would all benefit by more men in the pews."
1,"This book is POINTLESS, MEANINGLESS,","This book is only good for firestarter.The tone of the book is such that makes the auther sound like he just ""wanted to write a booK"". Sort of like somebody who speaks just to hear the sound of their own voice.The points in the book are shallow and worldly. Not once is there an exhortation for men to be drawn to Christ. The theme of the book is program, psychology, male vs. female differences, etc. Christ, Who is the true reason for a church ""service"", isn't even considered in this guys book.The men he speaks of in his book do not like going to church because they are probably not even Christians. But then he offers no effective suggestions to remedy this.The book is a waste of money, time, and even the effort to write this review. I decided that I would go through the effort to save others from the experience.THIS BOOK IS SHALLOW."
2,bogus book,"What is overlooked is the historical record: male clergy have always attracted a lot of women and fewer men to church. His convictions are based on a lot of assumptions, one being that men are 'created' to lead and rule over other genders; white men over other ethnicity/races?! This 'ruler-ship' mentality is the original sin. We need men to PARTNER with women and stop trying to assert their chest-thumping-aggressive-territorial dance. Grow up guys! You are MEN by modeling Jesus. He was fully human and fully divine. Our Savior to follow, a man of compassionate, caring, fierceness, who gave up POWER for the sake of the powerless. My church has a balance of men and women and the pastor is FEMALE!!! Guys love her and lead beside her! Everyone should read the:-Ten Lies The Church Tells Women - Rev"
1,Don't waste your money.,"This book is not without some good points, but it is mainly a bunch of opinions by church growth writers strung together in a new book. It portrays church as a woman lead mafia with men as figureheads in the pulpits and calls for men to be allowed to take on leadership rolls and use the gifts they have rather than try to do what women are good at. If you can remember that then you don't need to buy the book."
2,An unpleasant gotcha experience,"If you are looking for the 2004 edition, DON'T BUY THE KINDLE edition. I thought that I was getting an updated version of the book. It was very disappointing see that it closer to a REWRITE than an update. The chapters don't match. The narrative doesn't match. The flow doesn't match. The content was so different, and so much from the first book was completely left out. For example, the first book has the phrase ""Dangerous Men"". I couldn't find the phrase in the ""update"". Looks like the author ""feminized"" this release. Very disappointing. If you need an ebook version, buy a paperback and scan to a searchable PDF. I wish that I could get my money back."
3,Fresh views on men and church.,"David Murrow""s ""Why Men Hate going to church"" brings a refreshing approach to a subject that challenges the traditional churches in many countries. His reflections on the preferred lifestyle activities of most men and how these relate to their attitude towards church attendance cuts much closer to the bone than many more academic books on the same and similar subjects. This book will assist pastors and lay leaders."
5,Excellent thought-provoking book,"Although the author tends to overstate things at times,I found this book to be very thought-provoking.Some of my favorite nuggets:Instead of discipling people, we teach them.Howard Hendrick's quote on pillars and caterpillars.After years of safe, practical decisions, a church begins to decline.Make men think! Like toddlers, men want to do it themselves.Shift from learning about God to having adventures with God.We are changed by service, not sermons.Deepest relationships are formed though suffering."
4,Why Men Hate Going to Church,"I think he's right on target. This is a ""must read"" for church leaders serious about reaching men."
1,Simplistic view of why men leave the church,"I was able to read this book...or I should say, some of this book. I only read three chapters of this book and was deeply disappointed in how this book portrays the church and the simplicity of the lack of men in the modern church.Let me give you an example from the third chapter:""So men avoid church-and suffer for it. Men are more likely than women to be arrested, die violently, commit and be victims of crimes, go to jail, and be addicted. They also die more often on the job, have more heart attacks, commit suicide in greater numbers and live shorter lives than women"" (Murrow 23).So, men, if you want to live longer and not die on the job, you better get yourself to church!"
2,Out of the Box Solution???,"If you think there is an ""Out of the box solution"" to the lack of men's involvement in the church, this is the book for you. Otherwise, hit your knees. (Luke 10:2) Then ask yourself,""What did Jesus do?""No amount of mental gymnastics, programs, puzzles, tests, giftings or gimicks will get anyone engaged. That is all this book contains.If you can imagine any of these things helping your church or group grow (mature), then this is the book for you."
3,Common Sense Approach,"This book provided some insight into ways to get men back into the church. After reading this I couldn't help but look around my church and notice that there are more women than men. In fact, this is the case at most churches I have visited and not just recently. In my experience, there has always been more women than men in church. When I was younger I thought the absence of men was due to the Sunday sports TV line up. However, as I got older I realized this wasn't always the case.Murrow provides a good, albeit general, argument for reasons men are absent from church and also proposes ways to get men back in the church where they belong. He not only alerts us to the problem but proposes some viable solutions that are worth considering for any ministry seeking to amplify it's male membership population."
5,Amazing book. Powerful solutions.,"Growing up in the church, I was used to a lot of things mentioned in the book. However, I was certainly not comfortable with some of those things but struggled to put a name to some of the things that bothered me about church. This book helped me identify those things and give me an action plan for how to solve my concerns. Simple, easy, and cheap things. While not everything mentioned in this book is a negative for me, as I work in a secular world, I see and hear these reasons for my non-churched, non-christian friends frequently. And they're right. Now I see a way to make a difference. I've bought 8 of these books and began passing them around the church. I'm going to make a difference."
5,A must read.,"Insightful. Too true. It has validated my own experiences, in a more diplomatic, if not understated way. The work meticulously details the problems yet is careful to illuminate the path out of this natural disaster of our time. You must read this book."
3,why men hate going to church,"David murrow has written a book called, ""Why Men Hate Going to Church"" I am a pastor so it intreged me. I read it and it was well written and had plenty of stats. I do feel that he stereotyped most men. I do feel that men do need to step up to the plate with teh church but most importantly in their relationships with God.I liked this book but it was on teh verge of men bashing. I am sick and tired of men bashing. guys, lets just step up to teh plate so they dont bash us any more.I would recommend this book for mens groups, maybe take some guys through this at Men's breakfast or Sunday school. If you are a pastor, buy this book.I recieved this for free through www.booksneeze.com in exchange for an honest review."
3,Calling All Men,"There is a need for the church to address men's issues. They are losing their males. There is a gender gap. The problem is discussed and solutions suggested in Murrow's revised and updated book ""Why Men Hate Going To Church"" I highly recommend it. Read it and implement the suggestions to grow your membership."
3,Why Men Hate Going to Church,"I received Why Men Hate Going to Church by David Murrow by mistake from Booksneeze. They were nice enough to let me keep this book and send me the correct book I requested. The book is written in a way to help men realize the excuses they're making for not attending church, while helping women realize they contribute to the shortage of men in churches. Murrow goes on to explain how the churches have become 'feminized' and tailored towards women. He goes as far as to say churches have been 'softened'.Murrow explores why men make up less than 40% of those who attend church and what it is that drives men away from attending. He brings up many issues that churches of all denominations face, including failed leadership, churches that place themselves up on pillars and become ignorant of today's culture and lack of opportunities for male fellowshipwithin the church community.This was an interesting book on an interesting topic."
4,Boldly honest,"It can be rare, I believe, to find a book about the Christian church or the Christian life that dares to be human, that offers up original insights. This book does just that. For years, I struggled with my place as a man in the church, but reading this book really provided much light... and hope for guys like me. Just as importantly, Murrow has plenty to say to church leaders, too. It's a fact that churches fit with women's personalities, thought processes and social needs much better than with men's. Murrow reminds us to, in effect, remember that if the church wants to continue getting what it gets (ever declining interest by the menfolk), they should stop doing what they're doing -- creating environments that conflict with masculinity. God bless all the men who have grown disallusioned with the church for some of the issues that Murrow brings up. This book, in the end, offers them hope."
3,Three stars and three cheers for David Murrow!,"David Murrow identifies one of the failures of the contemporary Christian church: its failure to recruit and retain the young adult male. While I agreed with many points made by the author, such as excessive activity organised around and run by women, I did not agree with his premise that structured, liturgical worship will not work with this age group (I'm Anglican). A good read for anyone involved in evangelism or church planting. Mr Murrow makes some statements you won't hear made (audibly) in the typical church."
3,Helpful But Pandering to Fallen Machismo,"After 13 years in the pastorate, my conclusions about this run counter to several of the author's. Most of the spiritually reluctant men I've known have been simply afraid of any challenge to their own control over their lives. Some men hate going to church because the Gospel challenges them to be truly strong and self-giving, like Jesus, instead of just macho and self-absorbed with their toys, their bigotries, and their egos intact. Still, this book is good, and helpful in its limited way."
4,the church needs men!,"This book is probably the beginning of deep thought for many. Why do women outnumber men at almost all churches in the US today? The book explores some possible reasons, and offers some suggestions to fix the problem."
4,Excellent Book. What can I do - Get off the sidelines.,Excellent Read on the downfall of Men in the church. If you are looking for ways to stay relevant with the men in your community pick this book up. It will get you on the right track - asking the tough questions of your congregation.More than anything this book revealed where I am sitting on the sidelines. How can I jump in.
4,Practical Ideas,"Very useful as we re engineer the men's ministries at our church. I particularly like the practical suggestions of things to do, and not..."
2,As a male church goer...,"I have to say that I believe the biggest reason men do not attend church is that they do not know what they are missing. You hear people talk about having a personal relationship with Jesus, and yet they are unwilling to spend even an hour with Him during Mass and to have the most personal relationship possible in receiving Him in the Eucharist.How can you not want to go? To hear the word of God, the greatest collection of love letters ever written and then to partake in the same wedding feast that exists perpetually in heaven.I'm speechless."
3,when men dont go to church,"it was used as a church study group, we ordered 15 copies, and they said it turns out the classspend too much time on the subject"
5,This book is SPOT ON!,"I am posting this under my wife's account, but I swear I am a man! :)Murrow has definitely nailed men's ministry and he understands men and their needs. If you lead a church or are involved with ministering to men, this is a MUST read. I bought his DVD and his book, the dvd was great, agreed with 99% of it, and I am currently half way through the book. I am underlining probably 30-50 words per page. 5/5 STARS!!!"
3,My review,"First off, this isn't a book I really wanted to read.I would say this is a good book for all Christians to read. It talks about differences in men going to church and women going to church. This book has many graphs and charts comparing a topic between women and men. I am a christian and I go to church.This isn't a book I could sit down and read chapters at a time, it was very slow for me, I just couldn't get into very well. If you go to church and want to know why some men don't like going to church, then you should read this book. I think I will give this book for some else to read, I had my use for it and I think someone else could enjoy it!I received this book for free from Thomas Nelson and their program, BookSneeze and was not required to write a positive review. And even though I had received this book by mistake, I still decided to review it."
4,Great book!,"Thanks so much for writing on this topic! I think David has touched on a topic where few ppl would dare to, for fear of feminism. In the modern society, men are also required to shape up (a typical father's day msg) while women has constantly being empowered to fufill their destiny, find their identity etc. But David shows us that men has so much potential, if only the environment would change to bring out the potential in them and stop blaming men for being passive. Great work!!!"
4,Laughably True!,"This page turner is a must for any Pastor or Mens Ministry Leader. I can't tell you how many times while reading this book I have burst out laughing from David Murrows candid observations and illustrations! In many ways I'm thankful that my own church is not guilty of many of his observations, however many hit the mark.We are currently ramping up our own Mens Ministry and this book has given me some great guidelines and things to watch out for.If you are serious about drawing men to your church (and you should be!) you need to read this book and prepare yourself for some possibly painful reality checks.Thank you David Murrow for being so transparent with your own life. Reading this book is more like having a conversation with a good friend than a ""what to do/not to do"" book."
2,SCOOBY-DOO WHO DUN IT,"When you have only one real suspect, it is easy to figure out the killer. Rule of thumb...If you are going to cast people who can't act, cast women with lots of cleavage. Dumb males have deep pockets.They get to the island for a Survival reunion and find the hut is trashed, a warning ""You will all die"" written on the wall and the water is poisoned. So they opt to spend the night there instead of on the yacht that brought them. So the next morning, the boat is gone! So rather than stay together as a group, they all split off into couples and wander around the island into Rambo style traps. Meanwhile there are remote cameras all around the island filming everything (where did he get those batteries?).It is a yawn from start to finish. No real gore. No nudity, but with all the plot and acting of a ""B"" porno movie."
1,Jumping on the bandwagon,I knew this was going to be a low budget independent production coming out of Australia. I got it because of the one cent price.. I figured what the heck.All I can say is that all of the reviews were spot on.. And the ending was just flat out illogical and dumb. You cannot cut up everybody into body parts.. without having at least one survivor. If you like murder and mahem try an episode of Dexter. DO NOT GO TO THE EXPENSE OF BUYING OR EVEN RENTING THIS DVD. You will be waisting your time. This will be especially true if you watch it.. as I hate to admit that I did.
2,OK while it worked,I bought this for my son whole is a little rough on electronics. It was repaired once and then second time I think he got it wet. In any case it was not real durable as it only lasted a couple of months.
4,Smells like leather,"Pretty good quality, kind of bulky but any of the cases for the vision:m are bulky. I got mine about 3 months ago, still smells like leather!"
2,Not very impressed,"Nice leather but I had to widen the hole at the top so that I could open the flap to use the buttons when the headphones were plugged in. You can't dock to add music or recharge the player when it's in the case. You end up removing the player a lot.The small side buttons on the side of the touch part are almost impossible to use when in the case.Good but flawed, will do until something better is released."
4,Effective,"Read the directions carefully. Don't take 4 at one time or you'll be sorry. It is an herbal laxative, try two at first. It's better to eat figs or prunes before bedtime. Much easier on the stomach.Here's a better way than laxatives. Add a tablespoon of Natural Toasted Oat Bran to your cereal every day. Oat bran is cheap. You won't need laxatives."
3,Good for non-professional,I gave this product 3stars because the latching part of the connector will not latch into the equipment. Have to bend and manipulate the little release/locking arm to get it to work. Some won't at all. Not worth my time and trouble to ship back to seller. They are nice in that you can push your individual wires all the way through the connector to make sure that they are arranged correctly by color code etc... I have used half the box so far and probably half the connectors have the locking problem. I had better results with RJ45 connectors from Lowe's at nearly the same price. Shipping them with other items on free shipping swayed me to buy them through amazon. Probably better connectors on line with amazon but liked the idea that I could identify my wire colors in the right pin locations.
5,Taking cable ends into the future,you wouldn't think a cat5 connector couldn't get any better... its like redesigning the wheel. these cable ends are the only method i will ever use to create my runs. pricey but worth the money spent.pros: no need to purchase the pricey crimp tool. works with standard cat5 crimp tool. works with solid copper. extra long release tab works with end cap boots.
1,strut,this item is not so good is make sound like you never replaces them i will not by this item again
5,Transformers Animated Season 2,"I have been a Transformers fan for many years. However, when I first saw promos for this series, I was a little skeptical. The animation made it look like it would be a goofy kids series. Boy, was I wrong. This series has plenty of action which reminds me of the original 1980s Tranformers series. Thank you for sending this out to me."
3,Not what I remember,"The episodes are OK at best. I compare them to the first the first two seasons of the SIMPSONS; Homer has the ""different"" voice and Bart is the main character. Here, Optimus Prime sounds ""funny,"" Megatron does not look the same, Starscream is nowhere and they all work with and fight with humans. I know the later seasons will be much better."
2,Oh well,"I also have the earrings to match, however the pendant is peeling which is not very attractive..."
3,Cube block,I would have liked this much better if the silver coating had not been on two sides of the crystal cubes. You have to make sure it doesn't turn on your neck and the crystals are hidden behind the silver coating. It was okay not what I expected though.
4,This is not Cremation Jewelry,This item is listed on Amazon under Cremation Jewelry unfortunately it is not. When I went back and read the description of the pendant there is not a claim that it is Cremation jewelry which leads me to believe it is just incorrectly categorized. It is very pretty so I chose to keep it and I have gotten a lot of compliments.
1,CHEAP ITEM BROKE within 4.5 months time...,"Item purchased on July 10, 2012, by November 28, 2012 it had broken...GEM AVENUE will NOT honor cheap quality product...DO NOT BUY from GEM AVENUE as they are more interested in the money; NOT the customer..."
4,Dante would be proud.,Thigpen does an excellent job challenging our own private image of hell. Superb. Just wish I could find it in hardback because I've worn my poor paperback copy out.
4,A Journey Through Hell,"This was a very good book. I just couldn't put it down. My one problem was the ending, I wanted to know more. It left me empty, expecting more. I will buy the next book if its going to be a series."
3,nice for a little piece of art that will last for a little bit,"I guess it was my own fault, 10 by 8 is not very big, but I agree with the other person who posted-my print looked like it was carelessly packed and shipped haphazardly-how hard is it to send a poster safely if is your job?"
3,The Other Baker Street Detective,"First of all, the title is a misnomer- Sherlock Holmes has virtually nothing to do with any of these adventures of a former Baker Street Irregular turned (surprise!) consulting detective. Nevertheless, this book is still a moderately entertaining, if unchallenging, read. (The Scottish accents get a bit tiresome by book's end, however, as do the never ending barrage of pipe and tobacco purchases ...)"
2,Where's Sherlock?,"This is the first time I've read a book by this author and based on it, I wouldn't be likely to read another. A amateurish attempt to copy Conan Doyle's style, featuring an immature detective with petty, boring cases. Bought it 'cause I love Sherlock Holmes but this was a poor rip-off."
3,Broken white boards,I bought this for my two year old. It arrived with a broken white board. When I called for a replacement they said they were having trouble with their white boards and bc of that they won't be available until June 2010. They are shipping me a new white board in June.
3,70's Horror/Exploitation Adventure from Shaw Bros.,"For fans of Ku Feng, Lo Lieh, Ti Lung, Lily Li, Tanny Tien or low budget 70's horror/exploitation. Several breasts make an appearance and there are some amusing gross out shots as well. It gets a bit slow in the middle. It's not really good cinema so I can't recommend it to most but Shaw Bros. fans and those who find this kind of thing a guilty pleasure will have fun."
3,Different....,"Well, the only thing i can say is that ..its different!..that's for sure. Not a great film, its just OK. However, if you are looking for classic 70s horror..look some where else. This movie however, does have its moments, but, tends to drop the ball a lot. If you are a Shaw brothers fan you'll like it, cause again, its different since we are use to their kung-fu films...this one is truly an odd ball. Rental Only!!"
1,Nice ...at first,"Great fit. OEM look. My customer was satified at first,until the mirror started getting black spots on them that will not come off."
5,Sooooo Very Good,"Tanya Ann Crosby writes the story of two people who have insecurities and secret dreams hidden in their hearts. They are real people with real heart desires. Each finds the answer to their questions in the other and fall in love in the sweetest way. It's very passionate and very funny. Highly recommended. I've read it a couple of times.Also recommended: The MacKinnon's Bride, On Bended Knee"
5,Lyons Gift was awesome,I would highly recommend all the books in the highland bride series. I couldnt put the book down and looked forward to the next one. Read them and you will also love them. This book is a must read. Highland Romane books are my favorite and I have read hundreds of them. This was excellent
5,Love it!,Another very good story! Meghan was adorable and Lyon was very likeable. Looking forward to reading the next book in this series!
3,Piers and Mehgans story,This is one of the series of books. Book 2 I believe. I didn't like it as well as some of the books. I liked book 1 far better. Still it was worth reading.
3,An OK story,"This book was not bad, but neither was it as engaging as the first book of the series. I missed the humor that permiated the first book, the characters seemed flatter in this one and I found myself skimming through the pages more than once to get past excessively long ranting passages where characters were trying to figure out their own feelings/thoughts."
2,Just ok,A little boring. The first one in the series was far better. I am undecided if I will continue the series.
5,Great wheat alternative,Healthy. Tastes great! Great price compared to health food stores who price gouge! Thanks Amazon!
3,Does the job,"Good book to explain first communion. Was not what I would call a beautiful book that your child will cherish and look back on, but does what it sets out to do, talk to a child about first holy communion"
4,Cracking read,"Vidal effortlessly dismantles Christianity's pompous and often trite traditions and beliefs in this most enjoyable of iconoclastic romps. Ironically, he puts religion per se into a perspective that most non-believers can have some kind of faith in. Religious believers will condemn him for his blasphemy, which one can only assume would be the most satisfying aspect of the book for him. The language is smooth, the innovation compelling and the overall effect satisfying on every level. Not a classic but a great two-fingered salute to the hypocritical, conservative and wholly irreligious Church Establishment. Blue-rinsed church wardens and dubiously motivated church council members will hate it, which I am sure will make Mr. Vidal very happy."
4,Non-stop laughs!,"A great book! I'm sure a lot of people would find it blasphemous and insulting, but I have never seen such a clever satire of all religions taken together. The only drawback is that sometimes it's hard to follow the story. Other than that, I loved the unexpected twists and turns and mockery of the religious Establishment."
2,Big letdown from Vidal,"Why Gore Vidal, one of our greatest writers, would waste his time on this sophomoric exercise in tedious blasphemy, is beyond me. It isn't funny and strains to be blasphemous. It only ends up being a bore. Read Kalki for a better satire by Vidal."
4,Oldie but Goodie,"This little book was a must have back in the 1990s when the Chinese language was just coming on the scene in US colleges and universities. This book has real writing with real authors, not edited by a bunch of professors twisting around text to meet teaching needs and objectives. In fact a language placement exam for a prominent university in the midwest actually contained a selection from Glimpses of China. The book may be old but the stories are still good reading for today's times."
2,Lower cal equals lower taste quality,"Save some calories for real ""guilty"" chips if you can, because these aren't the greatest, taste-wise. It's nice to have options for lower calorie/fat tortilla chips, but it's just not the same. To me, not worth the sacrifice when I want some tortilla chips. Also, it took FOREVER to eat all of these and everyone was totally sick of them by the time we got to the third or fourth bag, let alone 12 bags!"
2,"Hey, its a textbook...its supposed to be dry","I came across this little gem during my MBA program, and kept it around as a desktop reference. Mr. Steele attempts to write a guideline for managing technology from the perspective of the mid-level manager, from innovation through integration. The book is dry, and not really positioned for the individual entrepreneur - its more of a large company mid-managed type book.Remember in the movie 'Dead Poets Society' how they had to read a book on how to appreciate poetry, and it was very militaristic and tedious? This is the technology management version of that book.I've referenced it a couple times, but there are far better guidelines on the market."
2,Virus Taxonomy Classification,Physicians and other people this book is very descriptive and places viruses in each specific catagory. We keep a copy of the set at my lab. It is very good to read.
1,Looks great but...,This is a bathroom light. It should stand up to the steam and moisture in the bathroom. Not even a year old and we have rust on the light and need to replace it. :(
5,Best Scar HEALING gel ever!,"Of course everyone has a different response to treatments but this has been the go to gel for minor scraps & bruises for the family.It's amazing as upon immediate application its soothes the wound and eases pain,all while healing and lessening the presence of a scar.It's a must for first aide kits and medicine cabinets especially if you have kids.I even used it on minor burns and yes, it works like a charm.Gr8 product!!Also if you have body aches,cramps or muscle pain try arnica tabletsArnica Montana 30x 250 Tabletsnow these little tablets out weigh any other pain relief tablet OTC."
5,Great Product,I am now taking a blood thinner and this work great on my bruises. I will be ordering more this week.
5,great stuff,this really works...it really helps aches and pains. in my house we use it alot..it is not sticky and it is odor free.
3,Boericke & Tafel Arniflora Natural TopicalPain Reliever offered Some Relief,"I used for irritated shoulder muscle strain & it helped some to relieve the pain. the 2nd use was for what I thought was a strained bicep, but it turned out to be a tear & did not relieve or lessen pain."
5,Pain relief,Arniflora is great for relieving the pain of arthritis. I have been using it for years and have introduced it to other sufferers. It gives you quick relief with NO odor or greasiness. I have also used it on bruises it really helps to relieve swelling and the bruise quickly disappears. This is a wonderful product !p.s. don't try any other arnica based product the best is Arniflora Gel the others just don't work as well.
4,For Severe Fibromyalgia Pain?,"I have severe fibromyalgia and am basically bed-ridden. If I have to do anything physical, my pain is increased a lot. This oderless gel helps a bit in relieving the pain and stiffness after carrying something heavy. It's probably more effective if I use it for the everyday pain that my pain medication doesn't touch. It boils down to having to have a whole arsenol of pain relievers, and with all of them together it can be quite effective."
5,arniflora,This stuff is wonderful. I woun't ever be with out it. I have giventubes to friends and family and they love it too.
3,Not Effective For Me,"This pain reliever did not live up to my expectations. I was impressed with the fact that it is a natural pain reliever; but it did not help me. I did not have a lot of soreness; but expected it to relieve the little that I was experiencing. Quite frankly, I was disappointed."
3,Just ok,"Used the product only once and I could not tell if it was effective or not. Would not recommend it based on my usage, but the jury is out on it."
3,It seems to help,"This gel does seem to offer a measure of relief, but not for an extended period of time. It is a clear gel and has a pleasant smell, is not greasy or oily and does not burn or sting. It works best on my lower back and occasionally helps with pain in my knee and leg. It seems to help me with pain while sleeping and while doing chores around the house. The pain relief is not dramatic, but does feel soothing and even a slight relief in pain can make the difference in how you feel and in what you can do. My mom also suffers from pain, and I am going to send some to her. I also plan to buy some more when I run out of my current tube. Overall, I like it and would recommend trying it is you suffer from either chronic or acute pain."
2,Doesn't work for us,Friend told us this works for his aches and pains. We bought 2 tubes for my husband's arthritic knee and it doesn't work any better then over-the-counter stuff; which doesn't work. Everyone is different but I still cannot see how any topical will penetrate deeply enough to work.
1,offered zero relief,i have used arnica products in the past and they did help my joint and bruise pain. but this stuff was just sticky and stinky and didn't help even a little. i get more relief from aspercream or ben gay. i was very disappointed.
1,Homeopathic!!!,"If I had known it was homeopathic before I ordered, I wouldn't have. Why? From Wikipedia (as of this review date) - ""Homeopathy Listeni/'ho'mi''p''i/ (also spelled homoeopathy[1] or homaeopathy) is a form of alternative medicine in which practitioners treat patients using highly diluted[2][3] preparations that are believed to cause healthy people to exhibit symptoms that are similar to those exhibited by the patient. The collective weight of scientific evidence has found homeopathy to be no more effective than a placebo.[2][3][4][5][6]""Note: ""...no more effective than a placebo.""The product says Arnica montana 1X % in a witch hazel base. So maybe witch hazel or placebo helps some?For me this product did nothing. No warm, no cooling, no lessening of the pain or stiffness. The massaging to rub this in did more then this product. Oh, and in case it matters, I used this for lower back pain."
1,garbage,"does absolutely nothing. i've been rubbing it on my knees, lower back, right shoulder, all to no avail with no relief whatsoever. i was hoping for a little something to ease these little nagging injuries due to years of weightlifting. there were many good reviews so i am bummed out about it."
1,BE WARE: this is HOMEOPATHIC,"Oops. I mistakenly purchased this and later saw that it was Homeopathic. So for me that means it is useless because I do not believe in homeopathy. Homeopathy means that the active ingredient was repeatedly diluted in water and shaken many times, each time removing and adding more water - before being added as an ingredient into the gel. In homeopathy, it is believed the water has a 'memory' of the active ingredient that was once there before dilution and it remains powerfully curative. Apparently this particular cream is only diluted 1x (one time) so there is probably a weak or small amount of active ingredient arnica in the gel, but probably not very much. Anyway, if you're looking for basic arnica gel, this isn't it. Buyer be ware."
1,Litereally does nothing,"Homeopathic remedy, literally does nothing. It contains zero arnica, which can be an actual medicine when present in the product."
1,When will the DVD come?,"The movie is a 5 star, so why did I give it 1 star you ask? Read on please. I saw part of this movie on television years ago and fell in love with it. I surely would love to purchase it but not at the outrageous price listed above and certainly not on a vsh tape. Why oh Why is the movie not on dvd? Maybe the better question is when will Amazon release the movie on dvd?"
3,"Real women, real passions","A collection of erotica written by women who were tired of porn written by and for men. Primarily vanilla in nature, these stories give us a wide range of fantasies which many women may be able to relate to. The focus is on the plot and the characters, the chance for women to make their voices heard. However, those voice sometimes seem more interested in making a political and social statement than expressing sensuality. Not the best choice to turn one on but a good choice to investigate what real women may fantasize about."
5,Best commentary I've ever read.,"For me, it has been hard to find a commentary that goes beyond the traditional expositional style. As I read this commentary, I gain the sense that this is inspired by a man's immersion in the Word for many years of growth. And because of that, it makes me desire that."
5,Awesome Bible resource,I love this so much. I have also bought the kindle version. If you want to really understand the bible. This is for you!
3,honda dashkit,Item was ok I only had installed it for few minutes but had to change it because my after market radio did not fit.
1,Hit and Miss,"Not all that great to be honest. Each issue is short, about 30 pages or so. The only thing about it that is consistently worth reading is Stanton Friedman's column, although it gets repetative pretty fast because he constantly uses his own set of personalized ufological ""buzz words."" It seems like in every column he mentions ""tribal warfare,"" ""3,000 trace cases,"" ""SETI cultists,"" ""long term survival,"" etc.Occasionally interesting articles will be published, but mostly it's just Stan Friedman, a star map and accounts of UFO sightings. And honestly, UFO sightings aren't that interesting. One can only read ""I saw a weird light zipping around in the sky"" so many times before one would rather be anal probed than keep going. It would make a good free newsletter, but it sure as heck isn't worth $[...] bucks for a subscription.If you're still interested in it despite my review, visit the Black Vault Wiki where PDFs of all of the pre-2008 back issues are available to download for free."
4,great condition,The item was delivered quickly and in the condition promised on website. I was pleased and will use this vendor in future.
5,Awesome,This CD is a good one. I can listen to it all of the time in my truck. I like the bass it puts out. Also I like this cause I know some of the towns they are talking about. So I say buy this CD it is worth your money
4,Deep in Kentucky Mud,"Watermelon, chicken, and grits......What more do you need.....Nappy roots brings country and hard times to the mainstream......Awnaw is a great song, and Marcos from p.o.d. gives it a rock twist......4 stars"
4,One of the most original hip-hop CD's out right now,"Most of you have probably heard ""AWNAW"" but you need to listen to the rest of this album as well. Nappy Roots has a very similar sound to Outkast, and they are incredible lyrically. I can already tell that if for some reason this group were to have a falling out, at least 3 of them would do very well as solo artists. Big V has a Scarface/Xzibit sound, Skinny Deville sound like the third member of Outkast, and Prophet's unique reggae style sound would make him an outstanding session rapper (such as Nate Dogg). Give this CD a listen."
4,True Kentucky Sounds,"In the state where bluegrass was originated and hip-hop artist are hard to find, Nappy Roots Comes with a true Kentucky sound. The Bluegrass roots are an eminent pat of there sound, yet bringing out some of the best contemporary hip-hop today. Nappy Roots gives a fresh new sound, and keeps away from the monatony of some of todays hip-hop. Instead of rapping about cars and girls, Nappy Roots comes correct with lyrics tha compliment there way of life... just ordinary country boys. The group charmonizes well with each vocalist showcases a different talent. They definately surpass the last Kentucky artist Buckshot, who as well came with his one unique sound."
4,Mrs Mallory series is charming,"I have read all the Mrs. Mallory books and this one in the series is delighgful. there is something about a geriatric widow sleuth in britian that is engaging for a quick and happy read. the plots are plausible and the snippets of her personal life, with her son and his family and her friends and pets enhances this cosy series. You don't have to really read them in order as they all do provide some background for your reference if this is a concern to your reading regime."
4,Great for Educational Purposes,"This book a good introduction for blueprint reading, there are 2D and 3D drawings that help readers to visualize the information on the drawings. At the end of each chapter are review questions and definitions of key words, which are useful especially for students.It comes with large construction drawings on three projects that were actually built. Although they should have printed them on separate pieces of paper instead of having them on both sides of the sheet, this makes it hard to compare and study those construction drawings.Also, the paper used for publication I find is a bit thin, you have to read the textbook on a flat surface, otherwise it will curl up. The same goes with the construction drawings, after a couple of times of folding and un-folding, the papers tend to tear easily.I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the building industry."
5,Exceptionallly Great and Educational,Purchasing this dvd made for one happy grandchild.It has made very clear to him just how one should handle ones emotions.Having learned several spanish words from Blues Clues dvd he is very excited with having learned Mandarin words with Kai Lai .A plus when it comes to diversity.The shipment arrived very quickly and the cost of this purchase was great.
1,Ni hiao Kailan,"I ordered this product to assist my children in learning basic chinese, however, as we live in Australia the product could not be played due to a mismatching regional code. We are very disappointed that we cannot use the purchase!!!"
1,Review,"I have listened to the approaches of james white and his mis quotations of Harold Camping. In listening to Dr.Whites approach,he does not aknowledge the Bible alone and its entirety, he adds his church confessions as well as twisting scripture by not examining the ones he quotes in light of the whole bible to form a conclusion. If we listen to Dr.White, we are to worship the church doctrines and confessions and people with Degrees because they are the ""Pillar and ground of truth"", not Gods Word which is THE BIBLE ALONE AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. Rev 18:7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow."
1,"Dr James White is the only one who is ""dangerous""","I was absolutely SHOCKED beyond words when I read this scathing attack on a ministry like Family Radio. Here is a ministry that has devoted itself, under the impeccable leadership of Brother Harold Camping, to being as faithful to the Word of God as humanly possible. And what a fine job they have done! If Dr James White can find anything wrong with such a noble pursuit (especially when churches everywhere have put their ""Confessions"" above the Bible itself), then I would ask Dr White and anyone who agrees with his nonsense (Mr Horth) to ""make your salvation sure"". God bless Family Radio, and God bless Harold Camping!"
1,Theological Credentials,"I would really hate to make this a forum for a defense of a great teacher, but I had to address the comment that Mr. Camping, was not a credentialed theologian. The amazing part is that if we are believers...true believers...we would know that God will use a rock to get His message through to His people. How important really are Mr. Camping's credentials? He does one thing consistently though...says and does nothing without referring to The Bible. We would all do a lot better to do that."
5,An important book,"The phillipine war fought between America and a series of guerillas between 1899 and 1902 is one of those forgotten wars that is fascinating and should be studied as a classic anti-insurgency campaign. It was also a war against Islamic insurgents, the Moros, in the south and one in which General 'Black Jack' Pershing led the Americans to victory.A fascinating book this is a true military history of the background and events and shows how the American army defeated the irregular units arrayed against it and how it also used incentives to draw the people to the side of the Americans so that in the end the insurgency had very few backers.Seth J. Frantzman"
2,Good but missing pages,"Very good book but when I got to chapter 14 on Samar, several pages were blank. Pages 308-309, 312-313, 316-317, 320-321, 324-325, 328-329, 332-333, and 336-337 were blank pages. This is unfortunate because my research paper is about the Balangiga battle which in located in Samar."
2,The apologist/centrist view from the West,"Although Linn and supporters of this view (including elitists such as the editors of the Council on Foreign Relations' Foreign Affairs)consider the deliberate provocations and genocidal fury of the United States, exhaustively detailed by Stuart C. Miller and other critics of the war, to be a ""myth"". This is an outrageous assertion, that Linn fails to support, while attempting to quietly paper over the history and repair the reputations of the Americans who killed a military disadvantaged opposition with brutality. Linn brushes off the butchery of Samar as no more than ""harsh"", while pushing the idea that Filipinos actually welcomed the US. Linn's bias in support of ""benevolent assimilation"" is clear. This dry blow by blow of military operations does not go into the much more important decision making at the all-important policy and geostrategy level."
2,Fails to Cover All Events,"I bought the book because I was interested in the battle of Malabon. Specifically, to get a history of the 71st Company, Coast Artillery Corps and the 3rd U.S. Infantry involvement. The battle for Malabon is not mentioned in the book even though companies of the 2nd Oregon Volunteer Infantry and the 1st Washington Volunteer Infantry were engaged on 25 March 1899. There is no mention in the book about the C.A.C. and just two brief entries about the 3rd Infantry. A definite waste of my money."
1,Almost blew up my houses,"We bought 2 of these sixteen months ago and the one installed by my gas stove died completely. I was smelling gas, and called the gas company who fixed the leak, discovered this faulty device and told me I was blessed not to have killed myself as well as my neighborhood. Please beware, don't buy this SafetySiren HS80504)"
3,Too Dark!,"They look great, easy to install. But they claim not to have any loss of light luminescence, and when they are on I cant see anything at night. Not safe at all."
4,Very well done,"Obviously if you don't like history, you shouldn't read this book. But if you are like me, and love to learn about history, then this book is a must. Do you want to talk about diving head-long into the Roman society? Do you want to talk about the beginning of the rise of the Caesars? Do you want to talk about all the gods and their influences on the ancient Romans? Then pick up this book and read it! Rome, in all its glory, comes back to life as you flip through the pages. The whole idea behind immersing you into the Roman civilization is astounding; Mrs. McCollough does a FANTASTIC job! I almost gave the book 5 stars, but I held back because it is incredibly long and sometimes overly complex or redundant. But other than that, I absolutely loved it! I am currently reading the next book in the series: The Grass Crown. So far, it is also excellent. Read On!"
1,Anachronistic and shallow,"I did not find the book rewarding, although I completed it. It read somewhat like an introductory textbook on ancient Rome written for young teenagers. I found the prose flat, colorless and wooden, anachronistic in some cases, shallow in most cases, and the characters more like twentieth century Brits, at best. In my opinion Ms. McCullough did not make any effort to delve into the minds or characters of these persons. I query whether Ms McCullough has studied any of the literature of the time or any scholar treatises on such literature, or on the events subject of the book. I have not yet read the sequels and am reluctant to buy the books, although I have deeply enjoyed study of this era and the Latin language for many years."
5,marvelous historical fiction,"I have never read a better series of historical novels than Colleen McCullough's ""Masters of Rome."" As both an enthusiastic fiction reader and a doctoral student in history, I stand in awe. To recreate a historical period in the kind of living detail McCullough provides is a daunting task; to do it and to make it riveting is little short of miraculous. I discovered these books recently and out of order, and immediately had to buy all five; when ""Caesar"" ended after the battle of Pharsalus, I promptly got online to find out when the next book was coming out, and was very relieved to discover that I have only two months to wait. It seems a very long time. All intelligent readers of historical fiction owe Ms. McCullough a debt of gratitude for producing art of this caliber."
3,"Tame stuff, these Romans","I seem to have made the mistake of reading a great book that wasn't the first of a series, and now I pay the price of treading back to the very first one, which leaves me disappointed. I first read ""Caesar's Women"", then backtracked to ""First Man In Rome"". While the former had me sneaking off every few minutes to catch up on some delightful reading, the latter left me rather moribund. I can only assume the series gets better, but the portrayals of Marius and Sulla could have used a touch more brevity. Sulla, in particular, whether one likes him or not, was one of the great men in history, and yet I didn't feel the author had a grasp on him. Doubtless, the next book in the series will illuminate this despot, but I haven't gotten there yet, so I cannot truthfully give this a big thumbs up. However, the author's research alone is worth the read, as it is quite stupendous. She displays a love of the time period of which she writes, and that's worth a read right there."
5,Outstanding,"Mrs. McCullough did an outstanding job in placing the reader in the subject period. It is obvious that much painstaking and detailed research went in to the writing of this book, and it was done so with what I believe is a smoothness of story-teling that even those not well versed in this period of Roman history can not only understand, but relate to.The tangled web of family ties and intrigue is tough to navigate, which is quite understandable from a modern perspective, being detached by 2100 years of intervening history, but still the best was done with what must have been difficult to write about.I also came away from reading this with a better understanding of the time period myself. The best sort of fiction, I have discovered, is one which keeps you entertained and increases your knowledge at the same time."
5,Wonderful book,This is definately a masterpiece of stortelling. It is an incredibly engrossing book that makes you want to learn more about ancient Rome. When you begin to research the history - it becomes clear how much of the story is based on actual history. This makes the book even better! Can't wait to get the second volume of this work.
5,Absolute Brilliance,"Colleen McCullough is a genius, a modern day Plutarch with an innate knowledge of the human condition. No historical writer has attempted a work on this scale, and few -if any- other than McCullough could pull it off. My only regret is that with the October Horse, she has brought this series to an end. I would have liked to see McCullough writing about Rome straight through the emperors, and even on into the survival of the Eastern Roman empire.Colleen McCullough educates, entertains, and has brought such a polished maturity to the historical fiction genre that was sorely needed. Her characters and historical detail are immaculate, so much so that when she does contrive an idea, it goes almost unnoticable. The amount of research in the pages is awsome.If you are tired of the recent quasi-historical drivel that has been popular of late, then look to Colleen McCullough as your guiding light."
5,The First Man In Rome,"I have read reviews of McCullough's Roman Series which range from the highest praise to a little critical. My rating is extraordinary for the series and extra extraodinary for the first two volumes (The First Man In Rome and The Grass Crown). Is anyone not hoping for another installment? Mrs. Augustus, who was dealt with a little in the McCullough's last Roman Series volume, may have been the most influential woman in history. Her creature, Tiberius, stood at the apex of Rome's power, but was the harbinger of Rome's nadir. There is plenty of stuff there for another volume of a great historical fiction series..r"
5,One of the best Historical NOvels,"I finished THe First Man In Rome in one day I couldn't put it down. I neglected my chores and homework to read All 1,000 pages. I am an avid reader,expecially of historical novels (being my age that's hard to belive)This is definatlly one of my true favorites. My favorite charecter was Sulla. A very flawed man man with a certain brillance. i was sorry to see this book end"
4,"solid background, too many characters","Once more McCullough has done here research and provides a fictional account which few historians would moan about. However, her character list is overwhelming at times, sometimes a new character is examined for only a few paragraphs then disappears entirely from the book. This can be very confusing and frustrating to a reader."
2,This is a tough read.,"And not very enjoyable either. It's interesting in the fact that I love the subject matter (ancient Rome), but it's just not a compelling story. It reads more like an annual account of what went on in Rome during this time frame as opposed to a rich story that you just can't put down."
2,could not get into this book,"am I the only one that just couldn't get into this book? I can certainly see how people loved it, but not me. The names, places and people were just too much.....I was planning on reading the others in the series, but not now."
1,Just not interesting,I tried to enjoy this book I really did it was just to much. One almost needs a degree in teh subject ini order to figure out what the heck is going on half the time. All the names are so similar and there is at least 3 so its confusing to figure out who is who. Such a shame but to difficult for the average person
5,"Superb, presentation of charactes & period captivates","I'd read the book 6 or so years ago and loved it. My recent reading brought me to appreciate not only the presentation of the characters and period, but the level of historical accuracy involved. Read this book and you'll be left HAVING to read the entire series and WAITING for the next book!!!"
3,Misunderstanding Sulla,"While this work is fun to read, and for what little is known about this great man, as Sulla was, Colleen makes him out to be a murderer and nothing could be further from the truth, unless you can call war an act of murder... Too many authors and historians of the period make the mistake of judging the man based on the morals of their current times. If any actions of a Roman general can be considered barbaric, then just keep in mind that in those times, Rome was still the closest thing to democracy and civilization in existence then. Everyone else were mere wild animals by comparison."
1,Anything I can't finish gets 1 star,"Rather boring. I was excited about the story line but was dissapointed by the actual writing. All I remember about this book is ""this person marries that person and gets some money. Then there is some battle and something about some mushrooms."" For such a long book there is a surprising lack of detail or drama. I got within 50 pages of the end and ask myself ""why bother?"""
2,"Dull, dull, dull!","In her attempt to prove she did her research, she turns what should be a fascinating period in history into a profound snore. I could hardly plod on to the end, and I won't pick up another in this series."
1,A snore,"I listened to this book on audio while commuting to and from work. When the author wrote about the relationships between the main characters it was OK, but the political speeches were so long and so boring I actually couldn't wait to get to work so I could turn it off. Everyone's name started to sound the same to me. I have a policy of always finishing a book that I have started, but this one really tested me. I will not be listening to any more books in this series."
1,Very tedious read,"I purchased this book to learn more about early Roman history prior to a trip planned later this year. This is one of the most tedious reading experiences I have ever had! It provides limited background and understanding to the culture, and instead is a boring composite of internal issues between several primary characters - none of whom are developed to the point that I cared about them. Dealing with the 3-4 word Latin names for each character (many of which were almost identical), added to the torment. I rarely do not finish a book - but after 600+ pages, I give! And unfortunately, I asked for (and received) the entire series for Christmas. What a waste!"
5,"Epic and grand. Any fan of HBO's Rome would love McCullough's style and accuracy, a stunning blend of fact and character","Any classics scholars who have plowed through some Livy will see here the same format, told in annals dated by the Consuls. See Marius and Sulla rise from peasantry and poverty to become Rome's first military leaders to really bend the state to unknown boundaries - Marius was elected consul 5 straight terms, the first to ever be even elected back to back. This is a story of the great men who began as strong allies and, thru fame and age, grew apart. The characterization of Sulla is amazing - McCullough's skills are most clear by the way she builds his character, as we see him kill those closest to him and remaining a shark of a man - efficient and brutal. A great book to tear through in a couple weeks, this one requires a fairly serious attention span, especially for those not familiar with the major players. Very, very good."
1,drill that does not work,"The item was described as used and had some scratches. We were not dissappointed in the appearance of the drill. The motor seemed to be fine;however, the chuck was frozen. It is impossible to put a drill bit in the chuck, therefore the drill is not usable. We contacted the seller and hope to get either a refund or a way to make the drill operable."
3,For my Visual Languade class...,"The book came a little too late, but other then that it was in good condition. The content in the book is kind of boring and I know the updated version is suppose to be better but this version was cheaper."
4,Seeing is Believing,"It's good to have eyes that work reasonably well, and a ""user's manual"" such as this to learn how to use them."
5,excellent!,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in media studies. The language is simple and articulate. The authors provide plenty of visual evidence in each chapter. If you enjoy reading about popular culture, even advertising strategies- this is the book for you."
4,Mass Media and the Public Sphere,"Sturkin and Cartwright have excelled in this chapter alone to define and classify the media landscape in a pedagogical sense. The chapter provided a clear, insightful, and through objective view point of mass media and its impact within the context of our post modern age. They laid out succinctly the historical battle lines drawn between the utopian and apocalyptic prognostications of mass media, and addressed the problem of democratizing mass media through the public sphere. The defining point made within this chapter was the emphasis on media usage being the catalyst for negative or positive future outcomes."
4,"Chapter Eight Scientific Looking, Looking at Science",Science plays an important role in life and over time it has grown in how we view scientific images in the world. From the ideas of photography and archiving people based on appearance and discriminatory matters to viewing images as evidence to explain truths science has come a long way. Science has also played a significant role in raising issues about abortion and how we view the fetus in relation to its mother. Through genetics and digital forms of viewing scientific data it is shown that we do not always have to rely on what we see but the ideas that lead up to or are raised because of these images. Finally scientific knowledge has helped to create entertainment purposes by distorting science and in helping to sell products through advertisements. Scientific viewing is all around us and through science images of people and the world are always changing.
2,Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture,I actually returned this book after leafing through it. It was a little disappointing and did not have much information other than common sense kind of info. Where was the meat?
3,Does the job but be careful!,We bought this for our office Kegerator.It totally does the trick but it is EASILY overtightened. You need to turn the key JUST enough to stop the beer from flowing when you pull the handle.We had 1 key break off in the lock within the first month.Eventually this thing completely broke and got stuck on our kegerator and had to be removed via hacksaw :)Still recommend this product (we will probably purchase another one because it lasted a fairly long time)- just be really careful when tightening it!
1,Bare Metal on Metal Binding Scratches Tap,"Immediately upon installing this tap lock I realized that I had to return it. It's a metal on metal screw-in binding lock and in no way would I want this on my tap. It's practically asking it to scratch it up. The lock and key turning is also difficult, felt like I was going to bend the key."
2,lock up,"A key is meant to lock and unlock. People have a tendency to turn the key too far to achieve a tighter fit. The threaded section that comes out is of a different metal than the brass section that turns. If turned too tight the threads freeze up. When this happens, the key is hard to turn thus twisting the key. If this happens several times the key can actually break off in the cyclinder. Then you have to use a screwdriver to push in on the part of the key that is broken off inside the cyclinder and turn to open up the lock. Then unless you can get the piece of broken key out the lock is useless."
4,Works like a charm!,"Easy system to use -- you screw the lock into place and then pull out the key (just don't over tighten) -- decent system to keep ""unauthorized"" access to your favorite brew. Only wish it came with more than one key. If you are looking to just have a locking system, this is a good product to use for the price."
1,Hated it,"Okay, I can grasp that Farley, the villan, used Madeline as a pawn after he ruined her. Where things go awry for me is that she is from a quality family and is whored out by the guy. What? Devlin wins his time with her while gambling against Farley. After he goes in to make good on his winnings they have this absurd interaction and dialog. THEN she offers to 'make love' with him very willingly and has mind-blowing sex. Now, keep in mind she is about 15-16 at the time. Fast forward to Chapter 2. Three years pass when Devlin wins gambling yet again, well, what do you know, he is offered Madeline who happens to have a toddler. I just can't go on relating all the dumb stuff.Everything about the first 3 chapters sucked. None of the characters had qualities that made you care about them. Trite dialog and far-fetched and contrived situations. Did not continue to read after Chapter 4. Do not recommend."
2,Deuce Anyone?,"If Devlin said 'deuce' one more time by the last page of this book, I think I would have screamed. Not to mention the MC was a spineless pushover. I give this book two stars and I'm being generous."
5,a real man's man,"is there anyone who could ever delight an audience like albert salmi? this lovable tough guy was a movie staple until his apparent unhinging. this book really fills you in on the life, loves, and tragic end to a real actor's actor."
3,Good but not great biography,"This biography of Albert Salmi was easy to read. As a Finnish reader I appreciated the fact that the Finnish names and words were right with only a couple of mistakes. As a psychologist I am not particularly keen about the idea of national characteristics, though those used to describe the Finns are quite benign ones. The distribution of personality traits are surely as wide as in any other countries. Salmi was really a great actor which is convincingly shown in the book. In the early part of the book large patches from the autobiography of Salmi himself is used, which was a bit odd way of writing a biography. The author obviously interviewed many known actors and directors, but their comments are usually very short ones. Too short for my taste. The afterword about Salmi children I found unnecessary. If you are familiar about Albert Salmi, by all means read this biography."
5,You will not forget these characters,"Highly entertaining peek into the art world -- what is art? How do you find it and create a market for it?The artists in The Last Folk Hero are charming people whose talent is brought to light by an unlikely character from Atlanta.Well researched, well written and fun read."
2,Rough read,"This book contains some very graphic and unpleasant scenes. There seems to be a theme of misogyny and bitterness about relationships in some of Barnes' books, which sometimes rings true and adds depth (e.g., ""Earth Made of Glass""), but this time just seems nasty and relentless. Another reviewer said the harem scenes were played for laughs, but I sure didn't find the humor. Not as good as ""The Duke of Uranium"", and the series so far is much weaker than the 1000 cultures series or the Orbital Resonance / Meme Wars series. John Barnes generally seems to be following in the footsteps of Heinlein, but if so, this is his ""Sixth Column"". The first John Barnes book I didn't finish."
5,Amazing,"This book describes all details of ballet movement with great clearness.It's a good option for ballet students and teachers who want to reach perfection.The method of Agrippina is famous and efective, so...Get one for your practice and grow up."
4,Excellent for teachers and dancers!,"It dose a wonderful job showing how each movement is suppose to be done step by step and showing all the names of each movement. Even if you do not know how to read you can look at the pictures, which show how, do every movement. The one thing I was disappointed the translator did not explain about the expression of each movement such as effacee expression is proud. The expression of each movement is something unique to the Vaganova Syllabus."
3,Not the best book for reviewing the basics!,I would recomend ballet basics. This is better illistrated!Ballet teacher in Tx
5,A ballet classic!,"Agrippina Vaganova is legendary in the world of Russian ballet and, in fact, the Russian style of ballet is usually called the Vaganova style(the term ""school"" is usually used instead of style). The reader should keep in mind that this is a classic and not a modern tutorial; nevertheless, it is so well written that it is still useful to today's students. In these pages we can learn many little tips not found elsewhere. The book is amazingly complete, despite its small size. The book will be most appreciated by the more mature sudents of ballet. This classic is ALWAYS included in any serious ballet library!"
5,Musical Story Hours,This is my favorite of Mr. Painter's three story hour books. It has excellent ideas for incorporating music into the lives of children / adults during story hour. It's a must read!
3,Super Reader,"Raven is a deadly female warrior woman, and Spellbinder is her Warlock partner. Unlike Red Sonja, she is not the chaste or shy type, and they have an open relationship as they go adventuring."
4,A helpful perspective,"in regards to the large anount of books available on the indians of robeson county, this one was one of the better ones, to me...the writing is fairly thick so for those not wanting to wade in there may be other books more to their tastes but i found it definately concise and informative..."
4,A Good Conclusion,"As twin boys come of age and step-up to their destiny, love, adventure, magic, and loyalty step-up to them. Sword and Shadow was an incredible read! A wonderful conclusion for those who have followed the Sword in Exile Trilogy. The characters seemed real, and, as often happens, they became my friends. I shared their trials and their joys with my heart racing and my mind spinning. Often during reading, I would laugh or jump up and down and then look around and realize that I was in my own house, and not on the battlefield with my favorite heros and heroines-a good feat for an author. The reason I give this book only four stars is that, as is often characteristic of Marston, the ending left somewhat to be desired. The epilogue gives a quick explanation of the years to come, but I, of course, yearned for more. Perhaps this is simply the mark of a good writer, but I think the story would have been enhanced by added pages. A wonderful read- enjoy it!"
4,A wonderful world full of loved ones.,"Gah...the ending. I first started this series with Kingmaker's Sword back when I was about 13, and found a dusty copy in a library. I was hooked, it became my best read ever, and I swiftly bought my own copy, and others to come, and read the whole first series. When the Sword and Exile series came out, i was devasted. So many of my favorite characters were being killed of like flies, Red Kian and Kerridwen of old age. (Needless to say Kian was my favorite. *hisses at Kerri*)The series came to a stunning conclusion that left me in tears, I am sorry to have left this world."
2,"I'm so, so terribly sorry.","If you have bought and read the rest of these, and you're wondering what the last ever is like, I'm so, so terribly sorry for you. Because this book is a complete cop out. Now, don't get me wrong, I love EVERYTHING I have ever read, but this *was* a cop out. She got to the end, and went, ""Oh my god, the end, better finish!"" and that's all I think I can say..."
2,What's the difference?,"Reading all six of Ann Marston's books is like those games in magazines and newsapers ""Spot the difference"". All the books are alike except some minor details. It's actually quite boring reading these books when you already know exactly what happens only by reading a few chapters. And to finish: an advice to all you fantasy readers out there - Books that evoke a sort ""prophecy of a hero that will defeat evil"" or something like that gives away the ending already."
5,A Newby's Perspective,"Workflow Handbook 2004 is perfect for someone in my position. I am trying to get up to speed in workflow technology, for I believe it will totally revamp IT and the way business is performed. Most books in the field offer one author's opinion, but the Handbook provides dozens. Plus, it provides the definitive work on BP notation and other fundamentals. The Appendix contains a veritable who's who in the workflow community. This book will come in very handy here at the Workflow Institute."
2,Too much or not enough...,"I recently purchased this to add variety to my exercise DVDs. After I talked myself passed the cartoon looking characters, I found that the high intensity option was too much jumping for this 54 year old. The low intensity option, however, didn't even raise my pulse. I was frustrated that I wasted a perfectly good hour, set aside for exercising, on this DVD."
5,she is a legend,jane fonda has still got it even better now on dvd great workouts i just wish she had her original workout on dvd her very first workout was brilliant and i would love to get it somehow
5,One of the best work out videos..,"I've been working out with Jane Fonda's fitness video for the last 11 years... and the result afterwards is really something. I actually saw my body transform!! Though i stopped 3 years ago and gained some weight afterwards, i m really looking forward to working out with Jane Fonda's fitness videos again now it's on DVD! Don't go wasting money on silly videos that you'll finally end up throwing away! The Jane Fonda Collection is the IN thing!!! I'de give 10 stars if possible!"
3,Not what I wanted-- but not that bad,"I was looking for a different Jane Fonda workout...but this one is kind of fun, actually it has two separate workouts on it and the price wasn't that bad. To be perfectly honest it is worth its price just to see the outfits and hair from the 80s!!I don't see why they don't put all of her old videos on DVD."
5,Jane Fonda is still the Queen of Workouts,I used to work out to all of Jane's workout tapes 20 years ago. Unfortunately all of my workouts are on VHS. I was so happy to see 2 of her old workouts converted to DVD.They should all be converted to DVD. I would be among the first customers.While the workouts are more challenging now with age and weight gain. I feel a burst of energy and motivation just being able to do these tapes again. I actually look forward to working out now. The crazy-eighties music and leotards make me crazy in a good way.
2,"Okay workout, too much fake squealing!","I wanted to enjoy this workout - I love workouts that include both cardio and strength training - but the ""eee-yahs!"" were just ridiculous. What makes it even worse it that it is obvious these sound effects were DUBBED IN afterward! You never see anyone actually making those sounds -- in fact, everyone seems to be to busy concentrating on what they are doing to stop and give a ""yee-hah!"" about it. I also found the big blonde who led the high-impact aerobics to be somewhat fake. Ride 'em cowboy?!? It seemed to me that the brunette who led the low-impact aerobics was also mildly irritated at her ""partner's"" over-enthusiasm for aerobics. Oh well, at least the DVD didn't cost me very much!"
5,jane fonda dvd,"the item came in a timely fashion, was in excellent condition and nd appropriately wrapped."
1,Outdated aerobics vid,"Crappy, outdated, 80s aerobics workout repackaged to appeal to today Mom's. Don't waste your money - buy my copy cheap!"
3,Talk about flash back ;-),Right back into the 80s here. I used to do Jane fonda when I was little with my mom. I was excited to see it on DVD to try. Unlike a lot of the newer videos I have.. I really like Jane because she tells you why you're doing what you're doing (ie. she points to the muscle groups.. tells you what they're for... how to know which weights to use).Compared to videos today-- this ones a bit cheesy ;-) I laughed a lot. But the workout is still there-- and so is the info.
1,WTF,"So, I purchased this DVD back in 2008 for the low price of $6.97 as a gift for my mom. My review is not for the quality of this product --which my mom loved so much that the DVD now skips -- my complaint is the ridiculous price of $112.00. I really want to buy my mother this workout DVD because it seems to really help with her back, but there is no way in hell that I'm going to pay this much for a single item."
2,Save your money,"Buy the real work of Joe Ross (Trading the Ross Hook, trading by the book,..), not the weak copy ""TNT"".The illustration is very poor (no time no price on the charts..?) the introduction up to page 113 is useless (if you like you can read for Mark Douglas instead). weak language not at all what Joe Ross used in his real work.too much marketing and advertising for the seminarsAppendixes are copied from trading the Ross Hook. All in all it is a very poor version of the original work of Mr. RossSave your money"
4,A little celtic.,"This is a pleasant little CD, good to listen to ease the tension of rush hour traffic."
4,This book will take the fear out of investing,"Most people are afraid of what they don't know and they don't understand the Stock Market and so they don't invest.

5,Time capsule into forgotten entertainers.,"Enjoyed this collection of shorts very much. Great to see entertainment as it was in the 1920's with many long forgotten Vaudeville singers, musicians, comedians and others doing their thing in talking film at its infancy. These shorts are a rare insight into 1920's popular entertainment. The quality of the subject matter is variable with such a huge selection on offer. Many are good, some bad and quite a few with the power to still shock. These films are restored to a degree and the sound is surprisingly good. This 4 disk set is well worth owning."
2,The very beginning of Patterns movement,"This book is really reserved for pattern's fans, because material inside is essentially focused on processes patterns, and design materials are expressed in a textual way. Anyway, some ideas are good to be kept aside, but amount of such ideas don't justify the book size."
4,Semi-Good Stuff for the Late Nights,"I got hold of the CD thinking that it was an all-electronic chillout compilation. Seems like I was wrong. There's some really good chill-out track on the disc, but there's also a few tracks that more or less ruins the mood. Tracks like ""Day By Day"" and ""Cookie Rave"" really gave me a nice feeling, while I was sitting at a friends house enjoying my Rum & Cola. But then other tracks started playing, and some of them were actually what one could call ""scary music""... Something that would belong in a church or a horror film. No good, and that's the reason why I only give this disc 4 stars. If a few of the tracks had been exchanged with some more relaxing chillout tracks, it would have been a 5-star... But not this time, Café Del Mar :)"
2,Not the strongest in the series,"This is really more electronic background music than a listening experience. I buy it for my friends who own restaurants, and put it on the hold music for my company."
2,Don't Bother!,"I am giving this record two stars instead of one because there are definately worse ""down-tempo"" and ""chill"" compilations floating around, but this is the worst Cafe del Mar CD I have heard. There is nothing new here. It sounds as though the DJ's could not decide if this was supposed to be funky chill or new age music. It reminded me of the band ""Delirium"" with Latin vocals. I truly do not recommend this album. It was given to me and I gave it away. It was that uninteresting! Try Volume Six instead."
2,What can i say....different,"I have been a big fan of Cafe del mar for the past couple of years. My favorite albums would have to be volume's 6 and 7.Volume 8 on the other hand, is a very big let down. It has none of the flare of the other volumes, giving the audience the impression of being a movie soundtrack instead of an album to listen to after a night of clubbing.The songs were weak and mis-matched, reflecting poorly on the skills of the two no-name DJ's who put this together. With the exception of a couple of songs, such as ""Any Other Name"" by Thomas Newman (Which was incidently taken from the American Beauty soundtrack) i was dissapointed with the album.Long gone are the days of Jose Padilla and his musical genius for matching together songs for his albums. However, even without Jose Padilla, Bruno Leprete did an excellent job of volume 7. I just don't understand why they didn't get him to compile Volume 8 aswell. I hope that this error in judgement is corrected for Volume 9."
4,SLEEPY SEAS,"This album is chilled, shaken (not stirred) and served up on a silver platter for consumption while by the sea or before you go to bed (or just being introspective). There are tracks from Goldfrapp and Dido on the album. A remix of ""Utopia"" by Goldfrapp that is pretty good but I didn't notice that it was really remixed. Basically, the album is woman-vocal-driven with smooth jazzy beats and a tiny bit of trip-hop influence. Over all a great album in comparison to the other CAFE's which have also have been up to par groove-wise."
3,"Café Del Mar, Vol. 8.....","I am a big fan of Chill out music and lounge. I have most of the Café Del Mar compilations. But having bought this latest Café Del Mar, I must say that I find it a bit too boring. Do not hear it if you are too exhausted! It is very comforting and relaxing music. But to me it is far too slow and especially without any surprises. So if you are going for a good Café Del Mar I would not recommend the latest one."
2,Not Up To Standards,"I found this CD to be disjointed and confusing in it's ""feel"". Not the type of Cafe Del Mar I enjoy."
3,"laid back, not ""chill"", nor ""ibiza""","I have Cafe Del Mar from V.1 to V.8. This album is a bit of disappointment to me. The first thing I notice is they changed the DJ. Overall the album lacks the sophisticated ""ibiza"" feel. Some people say it's too slow. I think it's too pop. Previous Cafe Del Mar defined the ""trend"". This one only followed the ""trend"". There's no music element that I've never heard of before in this album. But if you just like ""laid back"" music, this album is still pretty good.3 star is what I gave it."
3,"laid back, but no ""chill"", and no ""Ibiza""","As a big chill out fan, I own Cafe Del Mar V. 1 to V. 8. This album is a bit disappointment to me. The first thing I noticed is they changed DJ. Overall, this album lacks the sophisticated Ibiza feel. Some other reviewers mentioned it's too slow. IMHO, it's too ""POP"". Previous Cafe Del Mar releases defines the trend, this one follows the trend. That is the difference. I didn't find any music element in this album that is new, that I've never heard it before. It is definitely not as good as previous volumes. But if you like the ""lay back"" kinda music, this album is still pretty good."
2,Getting worse,"It seems the Cafe Del Mar series just gets worse. Aside from Goldfrapp's introductory track (mesmerizing), and a funky Digby Jones track, this CD does not impress. It has a nice variety of musical styles, which I can appreciate, but get the first few Cafe Del Mar CDs before this one."
3,Some gems amongst the fluff,"This year's hit-and-miss addition to the long-lived Café Del Mar compilation series. Historically the series has been an bell-weather of best and brightest of downtempo artists, but recently it's allowed more mainstream artists through the door (Exhibit A: Dido). Having said that there are still some treats to be found in this year's model, including a brand new, nearly-acoustic track from Lamb."
2,Not good enough,"Track 1-4: Volumen Ocho wants to set it off with some downtempo songs. These songs are so light (read boring) that I skip these first 4 songs everytime I listen to the CD. These song dosen't belong on a lounge CD.Track 5: Mari Boine - Gula gula on the other hand is an excellent track, and really the only reason for buying this CD.Track 6-11: The rest of the CD is more uptempo, but still lacks quality. A decent track is Digby Jones - Pina Colada, while Lamb - Gabriel is listenable.All-in-all the Mari Boine song safes this CD from getting 1 star. This CD can hardly be called a lounge-CD, and resembles more the ""Pure moods"" and ""No stress"" compilations. For true lounge you would be much better off with an older Cafe del mar compilation (4-7) or try instead all Hotel Costes (especially vol. Quatre), Buddha Bar (II), Om Lounge (2,1,3), Thievery Corporation ""The mirror conspiracy"" or St. Germain ""Tourist""."
5,Amazing,"This album is a great album. I love the music of Cafe del mar, not only this volume but all of them, and even I love more to go to the real Cafe del mar in Ibiza and listen to live music. This is an incredible and relaxing DVD. I had it since 2001 since it was released and I love it. I hugely recommend it.Este álbum es un gran álbum. Me encanta la música del Café del Mar, no solo este volumen sino todos ellos e incluso me gusta más escuchar música en directo en el Cafe del mar en Ibiza. Este DVD es súper relajante. Lo tengo desde el 2001 y me encanta. Lo recomiendo."
5,"Great CD, but beware...","I love this CD. It's one of my favorite works by Jeff Mills. But if you're a big JEff Mills fan, and want to own every CD with his name on it, BEWARE: This CD is Waveforms Transmission Vol. 1, it's exactly the same, not only are the songs the same, the packaging, booklet, everything. Why this is issued here under the name Apollo EP (it doesn't say Apollo on the CD) is beyond me. So,...great CD, but if you already have Waveform Transmission Vol. 1, you might not want this."
3,Lund bug shield.,"The item was exactly as described, the delivery was slow for my impatient personality. Overall good."
5,traditional excellence,a beautiful compilation of traditional irish music. bought specifically for the exquisite vocals of Liam O'Maonlai on track #8 (Ar Bruach Na Laoi) which is both masterful and soulful.
1,horrible,"Honestly, this is the worst quality wig I've ever seen. Took it out of the bag and was shocked. Beware, they don't let you return it. Do not buy it."
4,fun fro,"I have had a lot of good times in this fro! Not the most realistic looking wig (the hairline is a little wonky and obvious sometimes- but not too bad), but most folks aren't going for natural when wearing a fro. People still have asked if it's my real hair, it looks rad, is sturdy through high winds and lots of dancing and biking (I know this must be important to a lot of people ..hah...), love the color, the curls are cute, and the foam inside helps it keep a nice form... I ordered a new one since my oldie has lost some oomf after lots of wear and travel, but that's to be expected from this kind of hair hat."
3,Nice book,There are a number of valuable tips and suggestions that will help anyone that presently has or is interested in starting an herb related business.
2,Very Basic,"This book is written in the typical step by step ""how to"" style. Nice for someone who doesn't have a clue how to start a business or develop a business plan. I returned it as I found way to basic for me."
4,ABC's of Women and Islam,"This is a very informative book on the Islamic religion. I learned many things from My Sister's Lips. The writer does not try to convert the reader but goes into great detail to impart her beliefs and the reasons for those beliefs. I always say a person cannot be against a thing if they know nothing about it so, even though I have no interest in conversion to Islam, I was interested in the whats and whys of the religion. This book touched on many topics that I had questions about and spoke from a woman's point of view. It answered all my questions and gave me a glimpse of a world I was previously ignorant of. If you want the basic ABC's of Islam, this book is ideal."
3,Fair Album at Best,This album was a letdown after the marvelous Coming Up album that preceded it. It's not a bad album but has no great songs. Most of the album is fair at best.
4,Feeling safer,This product is exactly what we were looking for. Easy to install and get working. Feeling much safer having it in place.
4,Classic Fairy Tale With A Dora Twist.......,"Dora embarks on a super sized fairytale, adventure,along with her Monkey Pal Boots, and Swiping Fox Swiper. They must return the items Swiper took in the story book village. Most importantly,the group needs to get to the Three Little Pigs, who need their bricks back, to protect them from the Wolf.Dora and friends use the map,as they move through the different fairytales. As they pass, and complete tasks they move closer to their detestation.A little bit of Spanish,and other educational elements are used to complete their mission."
1,DVD was not working,The DVD was not working jumps from one scene to another. It was a total waste of money. I got ripped.
2,watch review,"the watch is ok except for the thermometer, it registers several degrees above actual temperature, I emailed the customer service dept about this problem, they replied that it was reading my body temperature also and to take the watch off to get an accurate reading, after taking the watch off it takes several minutes to get an accurate temp reading, there should be a temp compensator on the watch, I know there is such a thing, because I've had one before, from the same manufactorer.It makes no sense to have a thermometer on a watch if you have to take it off to get the temp."
1,Me or the watch,"I have no way of check other feature on the watch, but I don't think that the temperature is accurate. When I am wearing the watch and when I take it off, I get a different temparature reading. There is a diference between the temperature reading from my house thermostat and the watch too. The reading is different from reading when I go to my friend's and relative's house. So, sorry, I bought it retail, and I going to try to return it. Another thing, it only has 10 lap not 100 lap."
1,This Product Stinks,This product stinks. It is virtually unwatchable even when played in an upscaling DVD player. It's playback picture is totally washed out and the focus is so bad that the picture can't be watched. Contacted the vendor twice via Amazon email in this regard but never got a response. My recommendation is do not buy this item.
3,"Like the movie, not the transfer","If you just want the movie than it's worth it since it's not in any other form, but as a warning the transfer is not very good and is obviously from a videotape. The picture is clear but not digital so the image isn't greatly defined."
1,Pathetic video quality,"Like the other reviewers, this is a horrible video transfer. What a waste of money."
4,"well written, but out of date","Since this book is from 1998, it's quite out of date and doesn't cover many new media or ideas from the last few years."
1,Poor Photography Ruins Book,"Very disappointing book. Comes across more as a gimmick to make some fast cash by self publishing a book that includes the authors photos combined with Christian ""inspirational wisdom"" scattered across the pages from Lewis, Mullins and others.The best thing this book has going for it is the cover design. It's downhill after that. The photography is poor at best. Several images are blurry, while many suffer from poor exposure, lifeless composition, and a printing that renders the photographs dull.If you are looking for a gift book or coffee table photo book with eye popping photographs with ""inspirational wisdom"", this book does not deliver. Do not buy this book based upon it's cover.Highly disappointed. Not recommended."
2,Heh...whatever,"Well, first off, i don't want anyone dissing me because said bad things here. That is your warning.This toy is ok. I like the monster, but as far as the kit goes, i don't like it. The y-dragon and x-cannon are both ok. Nothing's wrong. It's the z-tank part that has the fault. My model was manufactured whong, so one of the two treads can't fit into the maing body. The hole is to small. It may have just been mine. It may not be though, so keep your recept. You may need to make a return trip."
4,Dr. Dave is a credit to Parents & Their children,"I found this book, especially the specific exercises to be extremely helpful. However, as an avid reader of all of Dr. Dave's work, I still think his first major title is his masterpiece, Selling Out America's Children. While this title has many positive messages for parents and their children, in his earlier work Dr. Walsh prophetically outlines the longterm effect that the media have on children. Reading it now is especially enertaining because it shows how on the money he was over 7 years ago. This current title takes his work to a new level, but once you read it, be sure to check out Selling America's Children!"
1,Another dumb book about controling kids,"Come on! This is junk! This book is all about how to limit your children from what's going on around them 24/7. It's about sheltering your child from stuff that they are going to see everywhere. How can you stop your children from seeing this stuff? Well, you can't. This book is aimed at insecure parents who don't trust their children and can't make their own decisions. It's another pointless, dumb book aimed at pissing your kids off and further ruining your relationship with them. Don't buy this book. If you want to limit your kids intake of violence, move to Montana and live on a secluded ranch."
1,screwed,"I was just stupid, I guess. It seemed to me from product info that there would be more than one bucket; but, alas, I paid more than 10 bucks for a 2 buck bucket. Also bucket is poorly made. I would not purchase from ace again."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this book partially based on good reviews. I was very disappointed. It was OK, but nothing spectacular, as I expected from the reviews. I do not recommend it. There is a lot of setup without a satisfying conclusion."
4,I loved it too,"I got this for Christmas and just finished it last night (my husband grabbed it first!). He spent time in Afghanistan as an attaché and he says the descriptions about the country and people are right on target. I loved the story, and especially the touching ending. I'm just starting Ascent from Darkness and so far I like it even better. I'm not sure what floats the previous reviewer's boat--maybe Twilight or some other fantasy read--but we couldn't disagree more about Winter in Kandahar."
5,Review of Winter in Kandahar by Steven E. Wilson,"Very rarely have I read a book this engrossing. Winter in Kandahar has it all---an internatonal bio-terrorism plot replete with devoted patriots, a secret hidden in the lining of an old coat, a dangerous stowaway, a friend's betrayal, a swift seduction, the machinations of the CIA, a shocking murder, a masterful disguise, an innocent child born of rape, several hidden hypodermics, and three pairs of lovers with very different fates. From Kandahar to Settle to Venice to Amsterdam to Santa Fe, I see in my mind's eye a thrilling movie with gorgeous sets; I'm already guessing who the studio will pick for the leads!"
5,A great adventure-war-romance-novel!,"This was one helluva read. I've been meaning to read it for sometime, but just couldn't get to it until a couple of weeks ago. Once I started, I could not put it down until I finished it. Great plot, great descriptions of exotic places and a couple of romances to boot. I could see this as a great movie. Highly recommended!"
2,Average Story,"I can only give this novel an average rating because I found the writing style stilted and the characters a little pretensious. It's more from the author's view of how struggles take place rather then having a feel of experience. Still, it's probably worth reading if you like that sort of thing."
3,Winter In Kandahar,This book says something. The only problem is that it starts slow and becomes very predictable. I wish that the author would of spent alittle more time telling the stories of the people and less time making this a stealing of the vile book!
1,"Bad, bad, bad","I always read reviews when choosing my next book to read. Often I ignore the poor reviews and give the book a try anyway. In the case of this book I should've listened! This book is just bad. I can look past the many typos but the writing itself is so amateurish it's hard to stomach. Shallow characters. Soap opera names. Ridiculous plot. Pointless sex. I gave it one star only because I couldn't award less. Read it if you want, but don't say you weren't warned!"
5,Winter in Kandahar,As good as any action novel I've read. It is so timely and insightful. It amazes me how Wilson was able to acquire all that knowledge of Middle Eastern culture. I loved the ending!
4,An excellent thriller and Benjamin Franklin Award Finalist,"This is an excellent thriller that centers on bio-engineered germ warfare directed toward a specific major population group within Afghanistan and Pakistan. Written by a medical doctor, the scientific aspects of gene manipulation are both understandable and believable. We are shown the centuries-old conflicts and grudges between different tribes in the region and why lasting peace is so unlikely to happen. The roles of the CIA and US special operations in the area and throughout the world and the lifestyles required of their families allows the reader insight into this covert world. The book's surprise ending is both entertaining and poignant.-Bob Spear, Publisher and Chief Reviewer, Heartland Reviews,"
2,"Interesting Concept, good attempt by novice.","I read lots of thrillers and this is a good first novel to a point. The plot is a bit far-fetched, like a romantic fantasy from a serial from the 1930's. Coincidences are stacked upon coincidences until deus ex machina applies throughout far more scenes than the final.Editing suffers and I agree with a previous review about the stilted conversation that is totally out of character from the characters using that dialogue. It's just not believable dialogue.The book is published by Hailey-Grey Books, and a Google search for them turns up only winterinkandahar.com...apparently the novel is self-published, which while not necessarily a bad thing, explains much of the draft style dialogue.Overall, its an okay book for reading if you're killing time waiting for your flight.I'm hoping Steve Wilson improves with effort."
5,"Wonderful, smart read!","I learned a great deal about the people and history of Afghanistan and the war on terrorism, while at the same time being captivated by the fascinating story that is the fiber of this book. The love stories were believable and enjoyable, especially the ill-fated romance between the protagonist Ahmed Jan and Shakiba. I read The Kite Runner when it first came out and I loved it too. However the focus of the two novels and the perspectives they bring about Afghanistan are very different. I highly recommend Winter in Kandahar."
2,Desperately seeking editor...,"Timely topic with great opportunity, but it let me down. disappointed. The excessive medical details and unbelievable love story were too distracting to enjoy the story line. How about more history, description of the people, culture, and events of the time? I started reading the book with an idea I could gain a greater understanding of the subject, but was sorely disappointed."
3,"Good Idea, poorly written, be sure and read all the reviews!","I give it three stars because of the story which is entertaining and very timely. In fACT that is why I ordered the book, plus it was being recommended all over Amazon. The story has great possibilities but It is poorly written, shallow characters who are not belivable. I hate to be mean but it did not grab me like a thriller should. It got me wondering about the recomendations all over amazon, heck best selling books don't get the recomendation this book has, must be the author and his friends. The only problem with this type of marketing is I feel duped and probably would not buy another book by this author. I also checked out this supposed Ben Franklin award deal, It is some small pubilshers marketing association promoting books I have never heard of, and no where did I see this book listed??????"
2,Disappointing Novel,"I purchased this book because of Amazon recommendations, based on my history of reading other books with plots centering on Afgan culture and political struggles in Afganistan. Dr. Wilson's description of biological warfare interested me, but the story otherwise fell short, lacking necessarty plot development. I would recommend that Dr. Wilson take a class in writing fiction and work on developing convincing characters. His development of Afgan women did not seem to coincide with the cultural ideals and deeply ingrained religious beliefs, but rather he portrayed all the women in this story as shallow and loose. What's the purpose of exploring another culture, yet obviously developing your characters from a western man's point of view?"
3,"Story 4, Writing 1","You will enjoy this book if you can get past the elementary school level of writing. Mr Wilson spins a good yarn, but needs some work on building compund sentences and getting better flow. Take some proceeds from this book and take some college level writing classes. Oh, and maybe get an effective editor."
3,Dr Wilson Pls get a MAP!,"I thought this was an entertaining book but there were MANY inaccuracies.A google map would have shown that the Hindu Kush is nowhere near Kandahar! It is north and if Ahmed was entering Afghanistan from the Hindu Kush he probably would have entered through Jalalabad. The Pakistan city of Chaman was spelled about 3 different ways in the book. Also, wikipedia could have told you that ""the"" Bagram airbase is also nowhere near Kandahar, it's up north close to Kabul. With so many maps available on-line, it wouldn't have taken much to verify the geographic locations. The Teresa and Shane characters were VERY weak, what were they brain-dead? I'd like to think that if someone approached me to help them commit genocide, I'd say NO! Good effort though for a first novel."
3,An interesting perspective on outing.,"There were some problems with the author's basic argument. For instance, he argues that no one has a right to the closet and the media are guilty for covering for people, but then the authors refuses to name many of the sources in the book."
5,"Unforgetable Musical Portrait of 1689 Seige of Derry, Ireland","The Relief of Derry Symphony commissioned by the Derry City Council and recorded live by the Ulster Orchestra at the Derry Guildhall is an incredible and unforgetable musical experience. Commissioned to celebrate the Tercentenary of the Siege of Derry, the composer Shaun Davey paints an extraordinary picture of the 105 day seige in 1689. One need not know the actual history of the seige to visualize the events portrayed. This recording is a must for anyone who enjoys Aaron Copeland's Fanfare for a Modern Man or Tchiachovsky's 1812 Symphony."
1,Very Disappointing,Mostly a collection of patterns that you can draw yourself or free download from the web. For fourteen dollars? I don't think so. Only two poorly illustrated and poorly explained demonstrations. You won't learn much from this.
3,Gardner's Garden Men,"The book illustrates in excruciating detail the steps necessary to carve the Greenman shown on the cover. I had hoped that it would have had, instead, patterns for more greenmen rather than so much detial on the one."
1,"door still slams shut, just more smoothly.","Not adjustable, sounds like air in the cylinder. I had to put the 20yr old Stanley one back on. I see its made for Stanley in Taiwan.I chose the most expensive one out of three thinking I'd get what I paid for. I'd gladly pay more for a quality part made here in the States, like the name Stanley used to be known for."
3,only will adjust swing in,"This door closer only will adjust the swing in, it will slow the door but will not adjust the latch, so the door slams into the latch.A good door closer has three adjustment settings; 1) swing out adjustment, 2)swing in adjustment, And 3) latch adjustment"
2,PAL FORMAT WON'T PLAY IN USA,"I ordered one of these w/ this cover from a different vendor as I wanted the original uncut version of this excellent DVD. Sadly, I neglected to look closely at the photo of the back cover. It identifies the disc as a PAL version which makes sense since it is a British import. PAL discs won't play on NTSC players sold in the USA. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news . . . I'm certain this seller is unaware of the problem."
1,Bad,"It would not work on our laptop, it kept freezing and locking it up. Would not recommend. Will not buy."
5,Excellent DVD,"Excellent DVD, and the first one in my NFR collection. I have all of them from 2004 thru 2011. The most disappointing of them, in order are the 2008 (50 year Anniversary NFR DVD), then the 2010 and 2011 DVDs. Quality has gone way down, and the prices have gone way up since the first series of DVDs. The 2008 50th Anniversary DVD should have been the best, but it is the highest cost and poorest sound quality of them all --- don't waste your money (on the 2008, 2010 or 2011 DVDs)!"
5,An art form,"And three of the finest artists in the world...that's way hokier than I had intended it to sound. This is a wonderful wonderful album, I lost my copy a while back, and am ecstatic to find I can replace it, i've found this album hard to come by. I took it to a musical, populated by kids who like Pop music and Alternative rag, stuff I can listen to and enjoy sometimes, but nothing I can throw on the stereo on repeat and use as a backdrop for my life, and all these kids, sitting there in the dressing room, enthralled by the sheer vocal talent, adn stylings of these three great men. It was a kodak moment."
1,Keep looking,"I'll just get to the point. This is a crappy product. I took this seat to a NY JETS game and it only lasted the first quarter, and by the 2nd quarter it was warm, and at the start of the 3rd quarter it was cold. I should have done better research on this product on the net. I've found some other bad reviews online."
1,Item did not worked as advertised.,This item did not worked as described on line. It did not stay warm for more then 30min at a time on medium setting. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,"History class, nothing more...","Acting- no good.Plot- no good.Scenery- ok.Watch it only if you have no other options for a saturday night movie at home, alone.The historical facts are very well presented, but there is nothing else to gain from this movie. Well, on second thought, Malcovich's final close up is great! jaja."
3,"Not incredible, not horrible","WARNING: If you haven't seen this, be aware some other viewers have damn near spoiled the film by giving away too much. Proceed with caution.But the film definitely has a message, and takes it's sweet time getting it across. That's OK, though; the pace is, as someone else said, as relaxing as a cruse. Granted, some things don't ring totally true, but that's OK; the film makes it point through its fundamental and total normalcy. I do think it ended a bit abruptly, however, despite the plot."
2,"A tepid, awkward travelogue interrupted by tepid, awkward dinner-table philosophy","A tepid, awkward travelogue interrupted by tepid, awkward dinner-table philosophy and put to rest by an awkward ending apparently intended to imbue the film with meaning through tragedy. The only success in the film was capturing John Malkovich's expression at the end of the movie and holding that one successful moment frozen through the credits."
3,A STRANGE PICTURE,"A Portuguese woman and her young daughter take a Mediterranean cruise ship while absorbing ancient historic sites and artifacts. Slow moving and clinical, the emotionless dialogue and blase photography forces the viewer to concentrate on the history lesson of western civilization, which evolves into a thematic comfort zone of it's own, until the preposterous climax, sure to incite emotion in the unsuspecting, and sedated viewer. ""A Talking Picture"" leaves one speechless."
3,Good/Bummed out,"I use to have this movie growing up but my VHS was so old it stopped playing. I was excited to see it available on here to rent but some of the major scenes were cut out. I dont know if it was my computer or the way it was displayed but it jumped ahead cutting out important parts of the movie. I did however really like the hosting parts from the movieScreams group, reminded me of early 80's/90's t.v shows. Brought me way back, gotta say loved that part just wish they included a list of the the other movie clips they were hosting so I could check them out later. The movie the Cursed is still an awesome low budget movie that doesn't get enough credit, so good and so under rated."
2,bought for husband.,"i do not like this kind of movies, but my husband watches them so, what you gonna do? got it for him and i just make myself scarce while he watches . too much violence and bad language."
2,The Stranger starring Cold Stone Steve Austin,The dvd was in great shape I was disappointed in how boring this movie was with my wrestler in it but the all can be HHH or John Cena! lol Thank you
3,Good movie.,"I only watched this movie one time, but it was over all a good movie. It could have been better."
2,Different????,"The movie was about a man that did not remember his past after a hitman tried to kill him but instead it was his wife and child, after the wounds healed and he had therapy he seeked revenge had flashbacks of the crime but could not remember who was after him and why they wanted him dead. The trouble with this movie was it was all over the place. At times it seemed to follow the plot but got lost with too many flashback scenes which was hard to follow through the movie it was only at the end it connected. To sum it up it got lost in translation I bought the movie hoping it was like condemmed The Stranger was lack luster."
1,A very bad film in all ways!!!,"Wow!!!! ,this is one of the baddest film ever made by Steve Austin .....this is a totally desaster movie ,low bugget ,low quality screening and acting ,,,,,where is the action here????,my advise to you? ,,,dont lose your money!!!!"
4,The stranger dvd,If you like Stone Cold Steve Austin this movie will not surprise you. It is Stone Cold being himself in odd situation. You will like this movie.
4,Those things they assume you know,This book is full of the answers in plain English to those items 'they' assume you know. It is nice to have information that is not geared to the 'professional programmer' but to those of us who like to program.
4,A practical approach...,You should have a basic knowledge of C++Builder before youget this book. Very specific solutions are given to very specificprogramming applications. The book has some wonderful sourcecode for practical programming. I've seen several programs in thisbook imitated and offered as shareware on the internet.Using various Win32 API functions with C++Builder is demonstratedand the examples are easy to follow. The book's format sets up aprogramming problem then shows the techniques used for solvingthe problem. The book does not cover every aspect of C++Builderprogramming (None of them do) but much insight can be gained from this book.I prefer this writing style over the other C++Builder books I have read
3,Missing Threads,"This is a quirky, interesting novel. The characters are well-developed, but the plot line is less so. Many threads are left dangling, and I had a feeling of disatsifaction at the end. Many questions were left unanswered. For a first novel, it was good. I'd watch for more from this author."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"Really smart lyrics, great guitar, great vocals. I love this band. I had them come and play at Columbia University for a formal...they were hot, both physically and musically. They are all really nice guys, and super talented. I suggest checking out their website www.jonfrederikband.com and checking them out in concert.This album is awesome!"
3,Passable but limited,"The authors clearly have personal experience of the subject, but their book is written too much from that experience and not enough from wider research. Similarly, since they both apparently have army experience, the naval and air force aspects of the joint-service enterprise get shorter shrift. Furthermore, too little attention is given to the actual application of what was learned in those classrooms.Pity, really: it could have been a much more engaging read."
2,Not what I wanted.,"These people need to update the title of what their selling. I ordered one of their Haynes manuals for (what the title says) a Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon, 1978-1990. I thought thats what I would be getting. Instead I didn't get the manual I needed and instead got the Dodge Omni. On top of that the sellers said the book was new, but opening the poorly taped together packing, it looked as if it had been used. I liked the Haynes manual just fine the book would be a great help if it was for my Plymouth Horizon, 1988. I hate to return things, but it is going back!"
3,verrrrrry rare stufffff,"although he's done better than these selection of tracks, this is still an excellent find when it comes to the Detroit old school. The last track will make it worthwhile, sort of."
2,POETRY AND DISASTROUS FIRES-I DON'T KNOW,"When I first ordered this book, I neglected to note that it is largely a book of poetry. Obenzinger describes great New York Fires from the 1600's to the 1980's but does so through poems and period writings. I would much prefer to have skipped all of that and actually learned something about these fires. Some of the stories here are good but fire buffs will be dissapointed. Save the poetry for another book!"
2,Not as comfy as it looks,My dog won't use it. The fabric is almost rubbery. Best thing to do is just spend the money to go to a pet store so u know what u r buying- u can see it in person.
4,Happy Puppy,"Great bed for the price, but I do wish the sides were stiffer. My Collie likes to press his back up against the wall of his old foam one, so it took him a few days to find his new ""comfy"" spot ;)"
2,Not really washable,"Bed is pretty comfortable and a good size. But the fact that it is so large makes it impossible to put into the washing machine. Not going to go through the trouble of taking it to the laundromat, so, unfortunately, I""ll be buying a new one and throwing this one out."
1,NOT AS PICTURED!,"The image of this vest shows two straps which buckle underneath the torso but I the item I received only has one strap and does not provide enough support for my dog. It also arrived dirty, looking like it's been used before. NOT HAPPY."
5,dogs love it,"this is the second one I've bought. I let my dogs swim in a lake and jump off our boat all the time, and although they are good swimmers I didn't want to worry about one of them drowning. It doesn't restrict any movement and if anything it makes them swim faster."
3,I'd recommend another brand,"I bought this for my 75lb pit bull and 12lb shit zhu. The Large life jacket I got for my pit bull/bull dog fit him great, however the jacket was so thin it really didn't give him to much boyoncy. He still had a great day, but one rescue and his jacket got a tear in it at the seam wear the nylon strap meats the body of the vest. I also later bought him an EzyDog Doggy Floation Device and although it doesnt fit as well, it is constructed much much better and about 3x the bouancy. For the shit zhu, the extra small jacket fit fine only ok, our shit zhu didn't seem to enjoy the water as much."
1,Returned/never rec'd credit!,I mailed the life vest back because it was too small. I have never heard anything and my card has NOT been credited. This has been well over a month ago and no credit! Beware
2,JMAX,Overall it fit the puppy fine. However the third time we used it the ring that you clip the leash to broke loose and we almost lost our puppy.Poor quality. Purchased from Amazon.
3,a nice discovery,"I never understand Criterion's choice of releases but I'm very glad they included this because this film was certainly well worth a watch. It has that kind of appeal only independent films have. It has a lot of twists and humor. The camera work and score are also very interesting. If you have never seen it I suggest you do. If you have, well, blu-ray is the perfect way to revisit it."
3,Scotland anyone?,"As for why I chose to move and live in a foreign country is as follows:DiversityEconomyandSex.the latter of the three is a masculine joke I'm forced to use, and as for the brute force and historical ""right of passage into manhood"" shone in this film, one might be able to say, the dark and somewhat obvious humor of such a piece of work would dissuade a liking to the style.As for my slightly biased (Danny Boyle) point of view,I can say no more other than watch it and realize why it is anyone has friends or, as it were, avoids friends."
3,Thriller Too Arty For It's Own Good,"""Shallow Grave"" falls in the category of flicks that I admire but don't particularly like. Director Danny Boyle displays some artistic fluorishes here but you sense that he's still getting his feet wet. He seems to be riffing off of Hitchcock and he just barely escapes parody. Considering the film is barely over ninety minutes the story seems incredibly thin. Money is the root of all evil? We get it. The central characters are spoiled yuppies who at their core are psychotic greedhounds? Real original observation. Recommended for Boyle completists only."
2,"Very, very shallow","Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge have proved that they make a great team on their others films like ""A Life Less Ordinary"" and ""The Beach"".But, this first film of theirs -- a moody thriller about greed and mistrust -- completely misses the mark. I never found myself caring about any of the three main characters and I was quickly hoping that they would kill each other and end the movie.Danny Boyle shows off his brilliant camerawork in this debut film, but the unfocused story seems to enjoy showing us just how gloomy the weather in Scotland is.The camerawork and editing shows, once again, that director Boyle works well with restrictions and a small budget. But, this story is so poorly written that the film is difficult to enjoy.Avoid this film, and check out the filmmakers other, better films."
5,A sordid look into the darkness of the human species:,"Better than ""A Simple Plan"" or ""Heart of Darkness"". This flick takes a look at just how bad human beings can be to one another when money is involved. Well acted, well directed, well shot. It doesn't get any better than this!"
4,You have to cover the trail!,"This little Scottish gem is worth watching more than once! I'll not bother recanting what it's about, you can read that above. This is a delightful example of how greed and peer pressure can twist and stain the human soul with ugliness. Most of the movie takes place in the three roommates' flat in Scotland so it has a real claustrophobic feel to it. The plot is simple, watch the three characters crumble as they're affected by their decision to keep the money and dispose of the body. Strongest scene: when David comments about the dinner after having to hack up the dead body ""It tastes different."" Possibly meaning both the dinner and everything else about his life. This film has a nice ending, not a phoney one just to keep everyone happy. Technically, the digital transfer is mediocre. The sound is quite low. I have to turn my TV up pretty high to hear it, but this could be due to poor production on the set. There are no extras included on this DVD."
5,Another brilliant film by director Danny Boyle!,"A movie about three Scottish flatmates who find their roomie dead; with a suitcase full of money stuffed under his bed. Then they have to decide what to do with it-- and if they keep it, how do they hide the body? A gruesomely well-written script and extraordinary acting by Ewan McGregor, Kerry Fox, and Christopher Eccleson make this movie a definite must-see for psychotic thriller fans. Ewan McGregor stands out as Alex Law, the sarcastic and verbally abusive character who knows exactly how to get rid of a corpse. His dry sense of humor and bad timing will keep you laughing throughout the film."
1,"Boring, Lethargic, Unconvincing, Over-Hyped Rubbish","I absolutely hated this film. I can see what all the fuss was about though. When a film brands itself ""contraversial"", ""hip"" and ""different"" it is bound to be popular even without proper scrutiny. For a start the plot is predictable and slow (McGregor, Fox and Eccleston spend ages interviewing and intimidating prospective new flatmates which is just unbelievably tedious) and all the characters in this film are deeply unpleasent, vicious people for whom I felt no sympathy. Add that to poor storyline development, an unconvincing and irritating affair between Fox's character and both male leads and you have a complete hour and a half of garbage."
2,"JUST ,WAS A OK TRILLER !!","You know when comes to thriller & suspense movies, nothing comes close to American movies. I saw this shallow grave , week ago in my friend house. Glad didn't buy it or waste my money on it. Was ok, Not much shocking or good suspense to this movie to real looking forward to it. .Ewan McGregor ,gives a good act in this movie & is all about it. is ok thriller about average !try ""WILDTHINGS"" ,""THE SCORE""/2001those movies is superior and good scrip to this mess.!!"
5,Verry Good,I had receved this early form Animeigo and to say the least i'm quite pleased with it. after going threw the 24 hrs of the TV sieries and the first OVA this was a great lead up to the movie but i won't spoil it for anyone you'll just need to see it for your self.. as a sugestion i would see the TV sieries befor watching the OVAs or the movie.. becouse the OVAs contenue off the TV sieries
3,not for a knee transplant,"For the last year, I've exercised every day with my neighbor, a 65 year old lady with a knee transplant. After the first day using this DVD she complained of pain. After the second day she had to take a break for a few days because she couldn't sleep at night due to the pain.Its a great workout and I enjoyed it, but it even made my hips hurt. We much prefer 30 minutes of Minna's Quick Fix workout. We do their crunches, weights, and buns exercises with no issues."
2,Not very fun,"Not one of my favourite dvd for exercising. I remember some of her old tapes were so fun. Found it boring for me. i prefered tamile webb workouts especially ""i want those series"""
4,Just what it promised,"If you can get past the old style clothes, the workouts are classic, easy to follow and very effective. Worth the time & money."
2,Not for me,This DVD just didn't have enough working for me. High impact was too much jumping and low impact didn't offer enough calorie burning.
3,Jane Fonda Workout,"Jane Fonda has some great workouts. This one didn't meet my needs. It's not that it's a bad video, there's just not enough ab workouts."
4,"If you want loose weigth or maintain it, this DVD is 4 U","I'm not fat, but I have a couple of pound to loose, and this DVD help me enough to get in shape, and like I'm looking for a baby, the section about pregnant workout is fabulous for me and for other person that doesn't have the habit of workouts, because is low impact."
5,Still a great workout!,"I recently dug up my old workout tapes and found the three pack of Jane Fonda smiling up at me. I figured I would pop one in and give it a try, see if the old girl could still give me a run for my money. You know what? I had a fantastic workout. Here is the deal, three tapes: Low impact aerobics & Stretch, Abs, Buns & Thighs and Total Body Sculpting. Each tape has two different workouts on it. The genius of this trio is that it comes with a workout plan, at least my tapes did and I assume the DVD does too. Because you have two workouts on each tape, if you follow the weekly plan and vary your workouts it keeps the ""workout boredom blues"" at bay. I assumed that a workout tape from 1995 would not be that great compared to all the ""high impact yoga"" and Pilates that is so popular now but it was refreshingly simple and fun!"
3,"decent workout, but...","It is peculiar no one mentioned the inadequacy of the organization of this DVD. Both ""Abs, Buns & Thighs"" and ""Total Body Sculpting"" consist of two separate workouts, but you can't access them from the menu! You have to fast-forward to the second workout in each section. It's unfortunate the makers of this video neglected to take advantage of the digital format."
4,Pretty good workout,You'll definitely generate a sweat with this workout. The mix of toning and aerobic work on the first set is really great. It keeps you motivated and the steps aren't very hard to learn.I do wish there was more ab work though. There are alot of squats. For the first section you'll just need a chair for support. The third section gets into weights for your legs and arms.
5,Happy to own this,Spectacular art Superb story truly one of the best story lines of this team my sole regret is that i have not purchased the hard cover volume this book does not disappoint
2,Messy Re-boot,"I was hoping that this series would pick up after the first volume, but no, it doesn't really work. For George Perez fans I'd recommend going back to his first run on this series and skip this one."
5,GREAT BOOOOOK,"Locker 13 by:R.L Stine is a very scary book, furthermore, the story is so interesting that you'll want to read it all in one day. I will provide you with a short summary that will give you an idea of what the story is about .Luke is starting his first day of school. Of course he always wants good luck. But this year is the opposite. First his locker number is 13(unlucky number which brings bad luck). Second he always fails his tests and his friend Hannah is getting 100% without studying. Why should she get the good luck? After a while Luke finds a skull that brings good luck, but not for long. Something terrible happens.I found that this book was great and I enjoyed it very much. I recommend this book to anyone who loves GOOSEBUMPS."
1,Puke!,"This book is the worst book I have ever read, and I read a lot. When I read this book, I fell asleep! I rate it zero starsc but it doesn't have that for an option. Read Scare School by R. L. Stine instead."
5,The Best and Safest Way to Learn How to Astral Travel,"This book, which is the perfect compliment to the online course, is a most practical and efficient guide that one could ask for. In it, Belzebuub explains the step-by-step process that teaches us how to Astral travel. Many techniques for the actual projection are given, as well as useful exercises that can be done during the day to increase our chances of successfully projecting. Again, 'A Course in Astral Travel and Dreams' is a one of a kind treasure and though just signing up and taking the course online is in itself great, the book is the perfect supplement to the free online courses offered by Belzebuub at Mysticweb. Enjoy!"
5,A Literally Cool Cap,"The ""Mesh Ivy"" cap is nicely made and good looking. It's best feature is that it keeps my head cooler in hot weather than my Kangol Tropic 504 Ventair does. When there's a breeze, I can actually feel air flowing between my scalp and the crown of the cap! I'll be adding another color or two to my collection. (I only wish it was available in a wider ""Big Apple"" style too, so more of my skin could be protected from the Sun. At least the brim is 1/2"" longer than on the 504 Ventair.)"
5,A wonderful shaving balm,My husband has used this balm for many years. He also uses another balm and likes it as well. He uses one of the balms daily.
1,"TERRIBLE, STILL WAITING FOR DAMAGED PRODUCT TO BE REPLACED","I ORDERED THE PRODUCT FOR XMAS, KNOWING IT WOULD COME IN JAN. IT CAME WITH NO PRODUCT LEFT IN TUBE. THEY PACKED IT IN AN ENVELOPE AND NO PRODUCT WAS LEFT IN TUBE. STILL WAITING FOR MAILING LABEL TO GET TO ME TO GET A REPLACEMENT."
4,"Overall, good","A little bit of a funny taste, but if you dilute it enough, you don't notice it. The ingredients are mostly good, with the exception of the maltodextrin. Overall, this is a good, worthwhile product."
5,Easier than pills!,"I add this to a nutritional cocktail that I take at night. I like that it is buffered (need that), and the price is reasonable. Shipped promptly."
3,RIP,"Despite its format, the Corpse never had that hot-off-the-press feel of the 60s mimeographed stuff (Mother, The World, countless others); even the smarter Art & Literature, Z and Unmuzzled Ox felt more subversive (authentic 'ragged school' Left Bank bohemian). What of the present collection? Chunky yet wayward, with a preface by raffish-yet-versatile NPR stalwart Codrescu (né Perlmutter) that oozes self-congratulation, which may very well be in order, but how readable, actually, are the pieces in this cabinet of curios? I found myself trawling through a little desperately looking for Sharon Mesmer (and failing to find her). Ach, machts nicht (German for 'forget it'): I actually went back to reading Mother! (Review to follow.) In the quiet dignity of its Black Sparrow livery, this would suit the coffee table of the maturer hipster. Worth a prayer"
3,wall of micromachines?,"This set of little figures from the classic Armored Trooper Votoms series is perfect for the aging geek who needs Japanese toys in his cubicle at work, but is too old school for the half-naked fully-developed pre-teen girl figures and brooding anorexic boys with oversized phallic weapons that dominate anime since ye old 1990s.However, these are typical of the Japanese toys of the early 1980s, where measurements are off and pieces don't quite fit together. Although they are capable of moving, once you've posed them, leave them alone. Don't geek out and start playing with them. Put them on their stands, join the stands into a wall, and leave them to collect dust. Remember a time when hard core military science fiction was in vogue in anime, before it became a wish fullfillment war between catholic school girls. Is Japan entirely populated by misunderstood Mary Sues and Gary Sues?"
4,repair manual,"I like that it is organized and easy to use. It's not as detailed as I had hpoed it would be, but for general maintenance, it works quite well."
2,PINBALL MISSED THE TARGET,Found this game to be a let down. Would like to have the fullscreen available to view while playing. Found flipper action slow. Best feature the multiball play where you have more than 3 balls simultaneously running on a play. Graphics are pretty however I found some areas of the board alittle difficult to focus on while playing (deadzones vs. livezones). Good bargain price but not an item to keep. Try EXTREME PINBALL instead.
3,at least its a complete season in one package!,"I agree that this was put together with little effort - the discs are not numbered and there is no summary of the episodes included. But I'm happy to see the complete Season 3 in one DVD package. I've just bought Season 4 on Amazon.De - Germany. It was expensive, but I wanted to see the rest of the series. That DVD set is in English and German, with German subtitles. Its not Region 1 (USA and Canada). Instead, its Region 2 for Europe only, so you have to have a no zone or decoded DVD player to watch it. In Season 4, the discs are numbered and an episode summary is included (in German but it was pretty easy to figure out the titles, such as ""Die Neue Generation"", ""Die Wilde Frau"" and ""Kannibalen"".) That makes me wonder why the same level of effort wasn't put into the USA release of Season 3."
3,Careful - season 3 should have 22 episodes - (not enough info given),"Amazon's description says ""Psi Factor: Season Three"", and then later on in the details it says ""Number of discs: 1"".I am most definitely a fan. I have been looking on eBay UK for all 4 seasons and would figure out how to watch them in the U.S. later. I am most grateful we are getting something here. It is my understanding that all 4 seasons are 22 episodes *each* and I don't think one season can fit on one disc. I have seen on eBay/UK something like, PSI FACTOR SEASON 3 VOLUME 3.7 EPS 3.20 TO 3.22. Another example SEASON 2 (5 disc-set 968 minutes). So ... know what you are paying for so your not surprised and then kick back and enjoy what I call a *great* series."
5,Great book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is surprisingly good considering the movie was terrible. The story line just kept me going where I can't put the book down. Very well written and definetly one of Crichton's best work.
4,Rising Sun,"This book deals with everything from murder to racism. It especially deals with the ongoing battle of business between the United States and Japan. Just when you think that you know what is going to happen next, a whole different thing happens than what you expected. What's great about this book is that it is non stop action from the beginning to the end. Whether it's a high speed chase or bodies that are found in swimming pools to people jumping off of buildings, this is the book toread if you are looking for these kind of things. Now that I have read this book, I know how serious the Japanese feel about business and believe, they take it very seriously. Ifyou are looking for abook with lots action, this is the book to check out. You won't be dissapointed."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An ok cop tale, partly based around some American Japanophobia. Throw in the beginnings of the technology for faking video evidence, and some corporate stuff. Then there is the auto-erotic asphyxiation gone just a bit too far problem for one of the visiting business types. Naturally one of the main characters is a Japanese liasion expert, throw him together with a garden variety cop type and there you go."
1,Rising Sun is a miss,"Michael Crichton's books are hit or miss. Rising Sun is a miss. I think it's supposed to be taking place during the mid to late 1980s when there was an influx of Japanese business ventures in the United States -- especially in California. I remember the xenophobic response from some people of my parents age and especially of people my grandparents age (not everyone, of course). As a teenager, I was surprised, confused and later embarrassed by the reactions of my relatives.Rising Sun is clearly playing into those sentiments and frankly I don't like it. Both cultures, American and Japanese in this book are reduced to stereotypal representations making for a boring, predicatable and insulting read."
2,Poor excuse for a thriller,Rising Sun was a terrible read. Crichton uses one device throughout: the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him. It's tiring and monotonous. Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures.
5,Didn't feel rascist... but I'm not Japanese.,"Its weird. I never felt the Japanese were evil when reading this book....Most people did.Instead I was impressed. If the stuff in the book is true, then they are truely brilliant, and simiply awesome at corperate affairs. The book never said the Japanese were evil, it said they were smart. He did do lots of research for it, whether he extraveggated or not I can't tell.The actual story is compelling and keen. It's been awhile since I read it, but it was barely under par next to his other novels.To any Japanese people reading this review, some how or another I have gained even more respect for your culture and country by reading this, though I can easily see why it is offensive."
4,The movie ruined it,"If you read the book, don't see the movie. Crichton has a flair for writing, unfortunatley not all of his books are easily transformed into movie format. Don't let this discourage you from reading and buying the book, it's very good.In his first attempt in giving an accurate look and sound to how frustrating, disgusting, and difficult an investigation for murder is, Crichton breaks the mold from other earlier books that he has written. Crichton uses foul language and explicit details into what appears to be a sexually related murder. This book is definatley not for children that might have read Jurassic Park and other Crichton novels, or for those with sensitive ears and eyes.If you are looking for a thrilling man hunt for a man unknown, a great murder mystery with action and incredible details, this book is for you!"
3,Fun Mystery,"Rising Sun is not a great book, but it is certainly worth reading. I struggled between 3 and 4 stars, and for me 3 stars is just good while 4 stars is real good.The whodunnit is really quite enjoyable and will keep you guessing, but for some reason I just didn't get engaged with the characters. Crichton just doesn't give enough meat in the character development to support what is a great plot. It is disappointing to be sure.As far as all the criticism over ""...-bashing"", don't buy it. Crichton is critical of the ... at times, but I think he's fair as a whole in his portrayal."
3,Mystery Novel Of Easy Value,"Sometimes when you figure out the mystery to a novel, it takes away some of the bite the book has. In Rising Sun I was not fooled at all by the tapes and the Eddie Shakurmura character. So that takes a little away. Also, Lieutenant Pete Smith is one of the worst, dragged out characters I have ever encountered in a book. Then again, John Connor is one of the best characters I have ever encountered in a book. Rising Sun is a split for me. I didn't know who really killed the girl until the end. But I knew everything else that leads up to it. An okay novel by Michael Crichton."
4,"Enjoyable, exciting, and scary!","This was a great surprise. I have to say that I just picked up this book because I received it as a gift and it was collecting too much dust just sitting there on my shelf. Plus it looked sad. But WOW I am glad that I read it. The pages flew by because I constantly wanted to find out what the next page held. There were countless twists that kept me on the proverbial ""edge-of-my-seat."" I like Crichton's writing and I thought that the soft and easy way that he took the reader through some of the more complex parts in the book was a necessary and uncomplicated way of handling it. I was scared only because I really hope that the U.S. isn't being taken over the way that many of the characters in the book say it is. I understand the need for fair competition but I hope that, unlike the book, there is a lot of ""fair"" involved. Good book."
2,didn't come true,"Many of the predictions in this book about the Japanese ""taking over America"" by buying it up have not come true. Indeed, with Japan's current economic decline the alarmist tone of this book is quite laughable. I remember reading it at the time and being somewhat skeptical, but in 2008, this book has almost no relevance except as an example of fear-mongering from a prior decade. The mystery story itself is only so-so. Stick to Jurassic Park or the Andromedia Strain."
3,Gripping but not great,"(Thriller) At a Japanese-owned building in Los Angeles, a woman is found dead. Two detectives must pass through a whole series of cultural barriers to solve this mystery. Lots of twists and turns, but I didn't find it so amazing. Generally entertaining, but the language was too much for me.Potentially offensive material: Continuous strong language, some violence and sex (brief but quite graphic)"
1,I didn't like this book,I am Japanese and I think this book is a disgrace to my family's heritage and all of the principles that I stand for.
5,A great book by a great author,The book is an great primer for anyone studying Japanese-American relations in the last 25 years of this century. The people who often complain about the book are people who are quite willing to sell anything for any price. The book points out that America is the land of Corporate garage sales that will eventually weaken or destroy the fabric of American society.
4,"Page-turner. Not great Lit, but wonderful summer stuff...","Clever story, good juxtaposition of Japanese culture vs. American culture. Technology thrown in adds some nice twists. As usual, fun book, terrible movie."
3,Least favorite but interesting,"Not really a book about science. If you want to learn about another culture (Japanese), Crichton does a great job informing and teaching in this. How to put this quickly?Story was boring and not very engaging (his other books were great at engaging), EXCEPT for the very end. The very end got your attention and made the book worth it.Characters are unimportant like al his books (for the most part, mirror images of State of Fear). Do you learn from this book? yes. Is it interesting? For the most part. If you want to learn about business or Japanese culture, read this. It is NOT xenophobic. Complaining about one or two aspects about the culture does not make him anti-Japanese, especially when he compliments them so much."
4,rising sun,"I love Michael Crichton and this is one of lesser known gems. The book only took three days to arrive, and is in exceptable condition."
4,Not Crichton's Best.....But.....,"Although the technology in this book is now dated, the story still can reel you in. I have read a few of Chrichton's books and this one certainly isn't his best, but it also is not his worst."
2,Outdated,"I found this to be one of Crichton's most disappointing books. When it was published, it may have found an audience that could relate, but with a currently different economical situation, most of the story is too outdated for a reader to appreciate. The mystery is thrilling, but Crichton ruins it with characters like Graham, who fits the racist anti-Japanese stereotype, and Connor, the enigmatic, all-knowing Sherlock Holmes. Even Connor treats the Japanese like a bit cruelly, referring to them the way a scientist would describe the characteristics of a strain of bacteria. I can see how certain qualities of Asian culture can be annoying, especially in business, but had Crichton written with a bit more diplomacy, his book would be a lot more popular today."
3,Quite possibly his worst,"It's a toss up between this and ""Congo"" for Crichton's worst novel. Saying that, ""Rising Sun"" has some style, a good plot, and a nice mystery--it's just not as original as his other stuff. I can think of a dozen better Crichton novels--""Airframe"", I suppose, would be in a similar field. Sort of. And ""Aiframe"" is his best ever.But this book just lacks a special something that makes Crichton's best THE best. He's followed the same path as in all his other novels--TONs of detailled research and some quite profound observations mixed in with his clipped (and rather monotonous) narrative--but still, it's just not as good as his other stuff.However, as we all know: Cricthon's worst is still miles ahead of some others' best I could mention. Worth reading."
2,Got to hate it when history proves you wrong,"The author was in good company when he wrote the book. Unfortunately, for him, things did not turn out as he had predicted. The economic postulates of this book are quite obviously, flawed. The United States was not bought by Japan. If they were indeed fighting a war with us the ""bomb"" we hit them with was the dot.bomb. Of course that had nothing to do with the ten year decline that they have been experiencing. One wonders who will be to blame for the next round of economic malaise.As far as the story itself goes, it is well written and interesting. There are a number of plot twists and turns and the reader is kept guessing. The dialog was authentically vulagr. Overall not nearly as good as some of the author's other works but a fun read."
3,...but not as good as the movie,"This was a good book, with one of Crichton's trademark page-turner plots that keep you wanting to read on to find out what happens. Lots of interesting science stuff, in which you never know how much is real, or potentially real, and how much is pure fiction. Crichton masterfully blends fiction with science fact. The only reason I gave this three stars instead of four is that he, unfortunately, inserted long paragraphs of dialogue that sounded too much like lecturing or preaching against the Japanese business practices. If you can look past that, the book is fun to read and worth picking up."
4,rising son raises the bar,"Rising son raises the bar on hi-tec crime novels ;although set in the mid-90's this novel is ahead of it's time,there is a murder in a japanese building and the japanese executives are the main suspects.The book's main character pete smith is a flawed fairly honest cop where as the secondary character, john connor, is the stronger of the two.Without giving away the plot, have yourself a good read about how the japanese will get even with us for being a super power.konichiwa kohai."
2,"engaging, but soggy and dated","Crichton departs from his usual formula in ""Rising Sun"", and the changes are not good ones. Instead of casting his big-plan-gone-wrong plot in some arena of science - scientific history, scientific future, medicine, technology - he chooses politics. Perhaps the story worked when it was first written, but ten years later it comes off as reactionary and outdated.Worse, instead of focusing on the nuts-and-bolts action of his story, Crichton makes a foray into more emotional territory with a first-person narrative that includes multiple love interests and parenting issues. He fails, however, to make his character either a believable man or a believable Crichton hero.But the book is not a failure: Crichton does still succeed at what he's always been best at. ""Rising Sun"" is an entertaining, quick read with plenty of twists and turns. For readers seeking only a quick thrill, the book offers more than enough."
2,Homework Helper Challenge Mazes K-1,I purchased this for my 5-year-old granddaughter. The mazes were so simple that she went through the entire book in two days. I don't think she learned much from it because it didn't offer too much of a challenge.
3,Not as good as King's novels,"I enjoyed all of the stories execpt for Rage. He had a good story, but failed to tell it well. However the other stories are interesting, especially The Long Walk. If you like King, stick to his novels, they are developed much better."
5,A book to be read again and again,This is a wonderful book for anyone who likes suspense. Be ready to lose sleep reading chapter after chapter!
4,Great break time reading,"This book is great for break time,lunch time,bed time or toilet time. The long walk was a little long, and it made my feet sore. But it was well worth it."
3,ok so far,"So far, I have read (& watched) Rage & The Running Man. In both stories, SK showed us his wide & varying writing styles. Readers will definitely tire of his stories if he compiles those with same plots & styles together. Rage is patterned after Carrie -- almost too similar. Characters, venue & plot are continuation of the original ""telekinetic"" novel. As it was, it became too predictable. With the Running Man, it was quite different. Here, SK gave us a glimpse of what the future would be if dishonesty, greed & poverty overtake the world. Our hero of course takes a strong hold at the center of the story - an innocent being trapped in a ""greedy game"" where survival of the fittest rules. Despite the absence of paranormal activities here, violence still exists. But the end redeems the entire story when good wins over evil. As it should be."
3,This book was very good,I like the book because it was the kind of book that left you in suspense and kind of horrified if life in the future would really be like and also what the game shows would be like. I think the book reminds me of hunting because they have this poor man running around like a deer or some other kind of animal for his life just so he could get money for his family just so his daughter wouldn't die. I think that this Stephen King book is not one of his usual kind of horror books. I think this book is a good one for other people to read.
4,Great insight in to modern-day tragedies,"Of the four novels, Rage was the most interesting and most important. The recent school shootings in Arkansas, Oregon and other areas of this country seem unbelievable and insane. One look inside the mind of the student who takes his class hostage in Rage and you begin to get an insight into a plausible, thought disheartening explanation. Those people trying to make sense of the random acts of violence need to read these four novels, especially Rage and Roadwork. The other two, The Running Man and The Long Walk seem unlikely to take place in the near future, but I wouldn't hold my breath. People need only look at the syphillis experiment in Alabama and American Gladiators as two example of what humans truly crave: control and violence. If a writer can create stories like this, who is to stop the government from controlling our freedom? Sounds a bit pessimistic, but only if it comes true."
4,Roadwork is the best,"This collection is, as you've probably read, the only way one can read King's controversial Rage. I bought this collection for that one, even though I had read the other three books included (The Long Walk, Roadwork, and The Running Man). I thought he could have created an incredible story with Rage, but found it to actually be pretty dull. I wasn't impressed. The Long Walk is a really interesting idea, but the story is pretty severly overrated. It's an enteratining read for sure, but it's definetely not one of his better books. The Running Man was quite good, and I absolutely loved the ending. Roadwork, the story of an angry man who self destructs, is the best of the bunch, and one of King's top ten best novels. I don't understand why it is so often cited as one of his worst books. I loved it and have read it a few times now. Sadly underrated."
4,"2 really good books, two lesser books.","These are 4 books that range in quality from moderately good to great. I heard SK (or RB) wrote running man in two days. It was so action - packed, it took me about as long to read it. That's gotta be my favorite(and if you saw that Swarzeneggar movie and think you know the story, you're wrong, the book is totallydifferent). Its also got some good ideas about class distinctions between rich and poor and is good Sci - Fi, futuristic tale. - - - - - ""The Long Walk"" is really good too, disturbing also. ""Rage"" and ""Roadwork"" are OK, luckily they end before they get too boring."
3,This book is not as good as King's other books.,"I think that King should stick to the really scary and unbelievable stuff.I really loved 'The Shining','Salem's Lot' and 'Four Past Midnight'.Why does he have to write these boring suspense books?.I just hated the long walk. It made me feel like I just camefrom a long walk myself."
3,The Long Walk,"The Long Walk is a good novel. It is not King's best by any means. However, it is an interesting novel in that it was written while King was pretty young, and you can see his style in its early stages of evolution. If ""The Long Walk"" is nothing else, it is an average story with great characters."
4,Great collection but with a series of low points,This collection showed the style and genius that is King but it dragged in some points and others never took off. The Longwalk is a must read though.
4,teen terror collection,"Great collection of late 50's scifi/monster movies. If you like the grade juvenile delinquent 50's schlock, you'll love this. Recommended."
5,Fills a definite need,"I had lost my wire attachment some years ago, I even have two staple guns and missplaced both attachments that came with the guns, and have been hanging xmas lights etc without one for too long. So I finally got fed up occasionally stapling through the wire and decided to order two through Amazon. These work great. I only wish they could design one that is attached to the gun and folds out of the way somehow so it can't be lost. Good product."
5,Heroes:50 stories of the American Spirt,"Execellent!! This book is truly a gem full of the stuff that courage under fire brings out of the human spirit. I could not put it down; each story brought me to the scene, living the amazing journeys that this courages everyday people went throught. As a witness of Sept 11 from my office window reading this book brought me a healing and an awareness that 911 can happen to anyone at any time and that the human spirit is truly undefeatable even if the body moves on.It's a must read book for anyone who is alive!*****"
5,Simple and effective!,"Great book with many recommendation for exercises, diet and equipment. Every exercise is illustrated well and the models are not bodybuilders that help to establish realistic goals."
1,oh vanity of vanity,"Another one of Kenneth Copelands vanity projects where he gets to strut around dressed as a cowboy and play the hero as extras who get paid scale look on and try not to laugh. The point of this debacle, presumably, is to provide some type of edification through a hopelessly outdated style of film...the serial western, but who knows. I get the feeling that good old Ken just sort of felt like playing cowboy for a few days.This would be fine if it wasn't financed by the social security checks of poverty stricken widows and dying cancer patients. I think this years Oscar is safe from Kens searing rendition of Wichita Slim, but if your idea of a perfect afternoon is watching a dumpy senior citizen with a bad dye job pretend to method act his way through a sub-standard Roy Rogers script, then maybe this is for you...."
5,Perfect Toy Box!,"I purchased this toy box just this past week and it arrived in just a couple of days--assembling it only took my husband about 20 minutes and it was so easy!! It is very durable and has wheels also--the removable dividers are perfect also!! I have to say the paintings of the farm scene and animals is just adorable--and is very well done!! And one of the best parts aside from this just being the most adorable toy box ever is that it has a safety lid--when you lift the lid, it will not slam down or close on its own-when you let go of the lid it only drops down about a couple inches and you have to very gently push it down to close it completely, so my son will never slam his fingers in this one--it's perfect!! I give this product absolutely 5 stars all around! And the price here on Amazon is better than the price if you buy directly from the company so buy it here!"
5,High quality and fine craftsmanship!,"This set is absolutely adorable. Looks even better in person than in picture. Sturdy too! (My husband 6' tall and 200 pds can sit and play with our daughter - wow!) Some of the animals are raised and our daughter loves to touch them. Another nice feature is the safety latch. We accidentally broke a part during assembly and the company rushed a replacement free of charge even though the damage was our own fault - Great customer service! Speaking of assembly, it was very easy with thorough labeling and instructions. I put together the table and chairs by myself while my husband assembled the toy box. This set will last a very long time! Love this product!"
2,The flavor =(,My opinion of this is not of it doing or not doing what it's for. I just don't like this flavor.
2,seems not to work,I bought a bottle of this as my sleep is totally messed up. At first I tried 2 capsules. Subsequent days I took four. It did nothing to help me sleep more soundly nor to get me back on a decent sleep schedule. Also it tastes horridly.
3,nice table for price - get a pro to install,"After shopping around abit, I chose the ' Vegas pool table for self & family.Once the table is together, you can appreciate the play. PUTTING it together, with lack of direct instructions, including things like 'how tight for the bolts' etc as there are many using different materials. No instructions for the felt. very lacking directions. But if you have the time to work at it, and are very mechanically inclined- with the right tools, it can be done alone. I just finished assembling one complete. the (3) 1"" slates are approx. 150# each & you need to physically lift each onto the table. One man CAN do this but surely not recommended.Enjoy."
4,Good buy laadie,"Being someone who has most of his CD's, I must say that this one is really nice, but not one of my favorites. Taken so, I am not extremely hot on straight traditional piping, which he does a good amount of in this album. Still, he has a couple of masterpieces in there that display his true talent of mixing magical Celtic moods with less traditional influences. If you like traditional, this is definitely one for you."
3,the least best <grin> Spillane CD,"In saying this is his (IMHO) least convincing CD, remember that makes it at least twice as good as 90% of the other dross out there. The mood just doesn't sustain, and there's a little too much of the headbangin'. Go listen to Pipedreams or Atlantic Bridge, see what I mean. BUT when the low whistle calls, you'll know it."
2,I bought the wrong product,I bought the wrong product and what I read for the return policy of the co was that Idid not qualify to return it.
3,Look at your prongs before odering,"I am not an electrician. When I looked at my dryer, I counted three prongs. It did not notice that one is curved.I think this unit is for 30 amp connections. My dryer has a different three prong plug which I think is for 50 amp connections.Too bad, I was really excited about this unit. Just a friendly heads up."
1,Outdated,Outdated publication. Maybe suitable for collector. Business strategies covered do no longer apply in fast changing IT environment.Decent hardcover quality. Content well structured.
4,Very good microphone,"I am a movie production teacher, and take lots of video for friends and family. I bought this microphone to improve the sound of the HC42.. It did the trick. The wind screen that comes with the mic does a great job, and is a conversation piece (looks like a dead squirrel) The bottom line is that the sound is noticeably better! Isn't that the point?"
3,Sony stereo microphone,"This mic worked fine for my application, but for most home movies, I really don't see the necessity for it. It did remove any noise associated with the camcorder, but still left enough hiss from the tape that you will need to eq the audio when editing."
2,Could not hear much difference,"I have not had the opportunity to use it much, but I am a little bit dissappointed about the sound quality, I was expecting clearer sound, the performance seems to be too similar to the embedded microphones to be worth the money"
1,HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED!!!,"First off, I own a HDR-HC3 sony camcorder. My initial problem was that after recording footage, I would easily hear the sound of the internal batter in the camera rolling. So after doing much research on whether to buy this mic attachment or the Stereo Gun Zoom Microphone by sony too, I decided to buy this one.PROBLEMS WITH THIS MIC:Even with the wind protector, it records even more fuzz and noise than the camcorder does without it. I am still baffled because the microphone is suppose to eliminate the various surrounding noises. Instead, it picks up the surrounding noise clearly ruining the dialogue spoken from your subject.ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE MIC:It records the sound of the person much clearer and this is quite noticeable.I am returning this microphone and hoping the shotgun zoom microphone will do the trick."
1,Research based?,"Given that a majority of dog trainers, and now a majority of veterinary school graduates are women, I suspect that there is no research that proves women have a harder time controlling dogs than do men."
5,Uno de los mejores Cds de este grupo,"Muy buen cd, sin ser solo de canciones que ya habian grabado. La cancion ""asi soy yo"" es un canciononon. Definitibamente satisfecho con la compra"
4,Lunch and easy,"I have prepared some recipes taken from this book, and they are easy and full of taste. This book is fun and have many tips for an easy and enjoyable meals."
1,Horrible!!! DO NOT BUY!,This book is horrible. There is almost NO English in it. I'm not sure how you're supposed to learn a language if the book doesn't tell you what it means in English. I literally mean there is NO English translation for what you are learning. There are only English descriptions of grammatics. Its unlike any other language book I've ever used. DO NOT BUY THIS! It also relies heavily on the CD. (which I did not receive with the book.) It would be impossible to just learn from the book. Don't waste your money.
3,Why don't we just study from Gilberts?,"Short review while I study contracts out of this book. The book is poorly written, where oftentimes the question of law is presented before the facts. Facts, though not what you should take with you, focus you to the event. Law with no facts is meaningless, and we might as well read out of the Restatement book. Sometimes the cases are pointlessly long, sometimes elusively short. Always confusing, never well written. Why put in 1st restatement when we are on the 3rd? Why tell the story out of order? Why give the procedural history before the facts? My questions go unanswered. However, as Contracts go, some of the cases they choose are interesting. Imagine if every single case was about breach of renter's agreement, or arbitration clause. At least there are some fun wheeling and dealings in here."
3,Good but cheap-feeling,"The content in the book is pretty good, though I'd prefer more meat and potatoes and less unnecessary discussion. It is interesting reading, but I prefer guide books to be more utilitarian. It also has a cheap feel to it--the paper is thin, sort of like newspaper. Lonely Planet feels sturdier, yet is thinner and has the same things to say. Let's Go also sells far too many advertisements in the book. I would understand seeing an ad every other page if it were free, but I paid for it and expect very few (if any) because of that."
3,funny,"this movie is unrealistically funny. it has that overexagerated jap theme to it, but gets 3 stars because there are parts that drag on. it is a good laugh."
3,Pearls,"They were beautiful, nice round pearls, but the colors were off. The black looking one in the picture turned out to be a bright magenta, and the silvery ones looked just like plain white pearls. That was kind of disappointing, but it might've been only me that it happened to. Otherwise, I'm pretty satisfied."
4,great,value for my money. with some chipped area on its cover but only tiny one. colored pages and easy to understand.
5,Amazingly fast delivery,"I was expecting to receive the book in two weeks, but amazingly someone knocked my door and handed the package to me the next day! Very happy customer."
5,Lively and joyous,The Reggae musicians recorded here seem immediately comfortable with the Dead's material. I guess that shouldn't be a big surprise--it's loose and open. The passion and joy in this music did surprise me.
4,Dreads do the Dead,Excellent covers of Grateful Dead songs by artists who have as much fun playing as The Dead did. Easy to smile when reggae music is coming out of my speakers with lyrics I know know by heart.
4,Flamin' Groovies - 'Backtracks' (Renaissance Records),"Can't believe no one has {up to now} reviewed this 'should-have' fifteen track Flamin' Groovies compilation CD. My guess is these cuts are a collection assembled by a band member (or two) of rarities, b-sides, covers, etc. Either way, 'Backtracks' is a fine pick. Look at the asking price here on Amazon. You cannot lose. Tunes that make this disc a keeper are the Paul Revere & The Raider's hit ""Kicks"", the foot-stomper ""Bittersweet"", the Beatles smash hit ""Money"", the live recordings of ""A Million Miles Away"" and ""Somebody's Fool"" and ""Tallahassee Lassie"". Better than I had anticipated. Really thought this was going to be one of those cheesy crappy budget releases. Glad that I was wrong."
1,Not a Happy Camper,"Right now, I am not very happy with this purchase. We have been unable to read the cd's to install the game. I have had to reorder the item in hopes the new one will work."
5,A must have for RPG fans,"I love games with infinite re-playability, and this is one of them! It even has an editor where you can create your own worlds! If you have not played this game, give it a try!"
1,Please be careful,"Although it is a great concept if it worked, I and others who have bought it have spent all of our time trying to get it fixed. Replaced wireless card, changed IP addresses, and found out it needed software update and now have to send it in because it freezes movies. Since it is past 15 days it is my dime to get it fixed even though it has never worked and I have been calling since day one. Anyway, you make the call, but I think it really needs more time in development - the price you pay for being an early adopter!"
5,Pants-wetting funny,"If you have asthma or a weak bladder, this DVD is not for you. You will laugh so hard that you will either die from lack of oxygen, or ruin your couch. For the healthy people - this DVD is GREAT! I bought one about two months ago and we've watched it 6 times already and we just keep laughing like it's the first time we've seen it. I only wish I could find more Mike Armstrong on DVD."
3,NO Question,"Good vocals, music. Excellent listening. They should bring out another album. On the same level as UNV etc. Collectors item."
5,A LONG TIME COMMING !,"I KNOW THESE BROTHERS,THEY HAVE PUT THEIR TIME IN AND BEEN PATIENT AND THE RESULT IS A MUSICAL COMBINATION OF SMOOTH VOCALS, BRILLIANT SONG WRITTING, SLAMMING TRACKS AND A LOVE FOR WHAT THEY DO. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THESE 4 BROTHERS ARE GOING TO PUT PHILLY BACK WHERE IT BELONGS (ON TOP OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY) CONGRADULATION FROM S-N-S PRODUCTIONS !"
2,Very expensive repeats,I really love Libera but I can't see the price I paid for this particular CD just to hear repeats of 7 cuts from other CD's. I would have given it 1 star but they get one for the video clip.Save your money or buy the other 4 Libera CD's and get more bang for the buck.
3,Fine but rare album,"Mainly the spacial of this album is that the main soloist in this album is Micheal, which means that the songs have been record for awhile. Micheal known as one of the soloist in Libera who can peform 'Far Away' the best in all time. Micheal's generation already past away, but it is reasonable for this album contains such a old song, because one, this album really has been out for awhile, second thing is that Japanese really knowing Libera as Micheal and Tom, Josh Madine and Ben and Edward Day aren't known at the period when Libera EMI produce this CD. So, I think this album is a rare album that has sung by rare soloist who no longer sing for 2 or more years. Now people who buys it may just want to have it in their collection, or who really likes Micheal. But the price is too over I think."
3,possible error on description,The list of songs you have for Fire on the Mountain 2 is the same as for Fire on the Mountain (1). You may want to look into this.
5,Great Movie!,I haven't seen this movie for years and loved it growing up. The movie was in great condition and I loved every minute of it.
2,Totally silly,Had a huge crush on Deven when I was little. Silly little movie with very little plot. But Brought back found memories.
1,dissatisfied customer,"Disappointed in Amazon and Longstreth Softball. Ordered the item, paid for it never received it. Was sent a completely different item and when I called about it I got the run around. The company finally sent the return label and only after they received the wrong item would my money be refunded. Amazon was no help and made it extremely hard to contact them. The Amazon customer service department must be located overseas and were absolutly no help. Altogether a dismal shopping experience."
5,Progesterone Cream really helps anti-aging,"I recommend progesterone cream over the counter as alternative hormonal therapy for women who have ceased with menopause, to replace the natural estrogen that helped keep the signs of aging at bay and return to younger looking skin, soft and feminine. The scent of rosemary is delightful. I wish I had known about this product when I was taken off estrogen by my physician several years ago. There is no need to succumb to secondary masculine traits. I advise you to check with your doctor to make sure you can use the product. The low amount of progesterone in this product is safe for the majority of women. I hope you try it. I also use phytoestrogen from the same company for the same reasons. One half teaspoon rubbed once or twice a day to the soft skin of the arm or legs is recommended. A 4 ounce jar lasts several months. Great product and price."
4,Pretty good so far...,"I purchased this product with some skeptism, but I wanted a natural progesterone product. I applied it as prescribed and I felt that it did help give me some hormonal balance during my menstral period, as I am perimenopausal and have an over production of estrogen. I felt much better than I usually felt during my cycle without the cream. I will continue to use. Additonally, the price was right."
5,Natural progesterone is the way to go,Tried both natural and synthetic progesterone creams before we learned that synthetic progesterone has some pretty serious side effects. This cream worked much better then expected and within 48 hours my wife said she was less stressed and more easily excited than she had been since we started having kids.
2,"Works, but...",The Natural Radiance brand smells SO much better and works almost like a moisturizer on your skin. This stuff isn't nearly as smooth and the odor of it is like medicinal rather than delicate.Effect is the same though!
2,Progesterone Cream - Personal thoughts,"I guess I was hoping for something short of a miracle. After using this cream for a month, I can't say I notice any difference. I plan to use for another 30 days. I've been told by my doctor there are better creams than this one - - particularly because this one has a slight smell and I understand it should not."
3,slow shipper,The product is fine but the shipping was slow. I have received purchases from Florida faster then from this company.
2,I don't really think this is helping,"This didn't really seem to help very much. My cramping was a little less severe, but still pretty bad, and it didn't do much to really reduce my other symptoms either (which I don't care to discuss in a publicly located review) . It helped a little, but not nearly as much as I was hoping. After my disappointment using it last month, I decided to not use it this month, and I am much worse than before. I would also like to note that it smells horrible."
2,Didnt notice any difference,I purchased it hoping it would help but didn't seem to do anything at all does have a nice smell
3,Natural Progesterone Cream,"I had hoped that a progesterone cream would help alleviate menstrual cramps and nausea, but it didn't. I will try a different brand after I use this one up. To be honest, I only used the cream once a day for two weeks. I was supposed to use it twice a day."
2,Didn't do much for me,I gave this to my sister and it helped her. Everyone's different so what works for one might not work on another. It is worth trying to see...
5,It works for me,"About 15 minutes after I put it on, I start feeling calmer. I'm sure everyone around me appreciates this stuff as much as I do!"
1,This brand doesn't work for me,"Although some people found this cream to work wonders, it didn't work for me. I started out with Emerita brand and it changed my life, I had more energy, slept better, had better memory, all sorts of things. I had purchased that at a health food store. I saw the Source Naturals on Amazon at a much better price and decided to try it. I do like that it's in a pot and it does have a nice smell but ever since I switched I've been feeling worse and worse. I don't know if it's the quality of ingredients or if it's the fact that Emerita comes from yam and Source Naturals comes from soy, or if there's another reason I haven't even guessed at. Everyone is different so if one cream doesn't work, try another. Going back to Emerita!"
5,Love it!,"Love it! I have had so much energy since I got this that I have had to tweak the dosage a bit, but that means it's starting to work."
2,Not for me.,"This product caused me to break out pretty badly. I only used this product for a month. I did notice increased energy, and I was really hopeful, but I couldn't handle the breakouts. After trying a different brand, I realized this product had quite a few added ingredients. It just wasn't for me."
3,Not sure,"I've been using this cream for about a month not sure that I see any changes @ all.I'm having a lot of trouble staying asleep not sure if this product contributes to that but my heat flashes have not subsided either. So for me I doubt that I will buy this cream again, but for some women I guess it may work, you'd have to try it for yourself!"
5,Progesterone Cream,Works good...no hot flashes when I use it consistently....I really notice a difference when i forget. I'm not crazy about the smell though. It's not bad...just not good. Adding a little lavender or orange oil would help.
5,an older women's best friend,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! it is the answer to my prayers. no more painful sex... I only brought one but now I am going back to have it shipped monthly because it is the absolute best product for women who suffer from 'dryness'
2,No.,I think that I need the estrogens more. This cream smells bad and it seems to do absolutely nothing. I think it actually cancels out my Estriol cream from Smoky Mountain so I have discontinued.
4,Prompt,"I gave it 4 starts ONLY because I'm not sure if it's as good as Progest (which I normally buy).I guess I'll never know unless they do a double blind study. However, Progest is the cream the scientists use that that's my standard. Bought this brand to save money."
5,really helps,"Great smell. I use the product twice a day everyday except my cycle week. It made a dramatic improvement in my moods, no more break thru bleeding. Overall a great, helpful product. I recommend to friends."
2,Amazon Removed My First Review. Caveat Emptor,"For an unknown reason (to me) Amazon removed my review for this product, so I'm writting another review. I bought the cream, and I'm on the second jar, but I still don't know if it's working. The amount of progesterone is not listed on the product, and when I contacted the manufacturer, it claimed that it was proprietary info. This leads me to believe that there is less than 450 mg of progesterone in the product. I will be buying another brand that lists at least that amount on its label."
1,Not for me.,"I know this has helped some people; however, this made me feel absolutely horrible. I would not recommned it."
1,false hope,"since the reviews for this product were so good, I decided to try it only to find out it has zere effect. it did not bring any energy or sex drive back. It infact allowed hot flashes and mood swings. I will go back to sarati brand progesterone since I have used it before. it was an old bottle and I hope the new formula works as good as the old one."
2,not sure if i want to use,i just received my tube in the mail and read the back of it and it says in California progesterone has been linked to cancer. I thought this was a bioedentical form from plants not chemicals now i'm not sure if I want to use it. I think I should have bought the wild yam cream instead.
3,Good product,but i used too much i think and wound up getting a rash all along my arms... This is now filler space. The end. This is now filler space. The end.
3,Good but a little out of date...,The book is good but was published in 1983. Since then there's been some pretty major advancements in filtration and overall care for saltwater aquariums. It is an interesting read though and you can tell the author really cares about the marine aquarium home habitat. If you're looking to learn about marine aquariums there are some books that are better suited but if you're looking to learn more about how the hobby has grown it would be a good read for you.
3,"Warshawski is alot like Kinsey Milhone, but less likeable.","V.I. Washawski is another tough woman private eye who lives without much of a social life - except for the old widower who thinks of her as family. Sound familiar? It did to me. V.I. Washawski is practically interchangable with Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone. In Blood Shot, Kinsey even gets an honorable mention. I don't know which author is copying whom, but I know I prefer Kinsey to the humour- and friendless V.I Warshawski."
2,Basic cliche ridden detective novel,"This is your basic private detective story. All the cliches are here. Getting involved with the old neighborhood, the old aquaintance being murdered, the rich guy that tries to buy off the PI, the PI is always broke, organized crime and crooked politicians, the PI getting beat up, the gun battle in the end and a few threads left hanging. Alot of the ""mysteries"" are fairly obvious and you know who will be killed but there are some twists in the end.The story does move along and rarely drags. But it is never exciting enough where you can't put the book down. And it never pulls you into the PI's world. The writing style is a poor imitation of other detective novels.The novelty of the book is that the PI is a woman. But the way the book is written, it doesn't really add anything to the story. The PI could have been anyone. I didn't hate the book but I would never buy another by the author."
4,Another Good Book in the V.I. Warshoski Series,This is another great V.I. mystery. It keeps up thesuspense until the end. The characterization is goodand their are subtle nuances of personalities. It isgreat fun and a good addition to this series.
3,not bad but hear better,War is classic rock/funk at its best however this CD isn't the best choice for it. A couple songs stand out such as Low Rider and Why Can't We Be Friends but they have so many other soul/ old school songs that one Cd can't capture
4,One of the best LOTR figure,"This one of the best LOTR figure. The detail sculpture, Painting & articulation are amazing!!"
1,Think I wasted my money,"I cannot see that this makes a difference. X10 products that could not be controlled from 1 room to another before, still cannot be controlled from 1 room to another."
4,These are Nice sleeves...but,"I ordered these sleeves for my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.. Turns out they are a bi too large for them. Sure I could use them, but for Yu-Gi-Oh cards, your sleeves MUST match up with your cards in size.. If not, it could cause your cards to bend more when doing things like shuffling your deck. I'm going to sell them to a friend who may have a use for them."
4,Ultra rare early rock n' roll Xmas songs!,"I have a fairly large collection of Christmas CD's, especially Rock and Roll Xmas CD's, and this CD is one of the best. There's only two songs on this collection that I have on other compilations, and only two other covers that I have other versions of elsewhere.This disc has unknown songs by mostly unknown artists from what sounds like the late 50's and early 60's (that's my one complaint, that the liner notes don't include more info on the artists and the recordings, just a few photos along with the titles and artists).Most of the songs fall into the rockabilly category, but some are more western swing, and a few are mainstream pop, doo wop, or even early surf...a few of these are strange demented novelty tunes, but the rest just plain rock!"
5,Rocking and hoppin Santa,Very please with all tracks. I am amazed some did not make it big. This on is on my top five Christmas music list IF you like rockabiilly
4,A lotta fun,This cd presents a wide variety of artists performing the 50's rock-a-billy style. I like to listen to it over and over because of it's variety. It's a fun break from tradtional christmas music
1,Look Elsewhere for Light Recipes,"I bought this book used and, after having read through it thoroughly, have come to the conclusion it would be overpriced at 50 cents. Almost every recipe calls for hard to find ingredients. Many are neither low fat nor low carb. A few recipes even call for deep frying. Unlike every other cookbook that provides nutritional information, this one gives the calorie/fat/carb counts for the entire recipe, not just a single serving.Also, the ""witty anecdotes"" from the author (which were one of the things I was really looking forward to) come across as very pompous and self-agrandizing. Mr. Giobbi finds fault with everything from the spelling of broccoli rab to the poor quality of chickens available in local stores.An absolute waste of money."
5,A Modern Classic,"I love to ""discover"" modern composers writing great classical music. This is one such example.The playing of Lin, Fan, and the Kansas City Symphony is wonderful. In my opinion, Lin is the greatest living violinist, and one of the best ever. I haven't heard a disappointing recording done by him.And, as usual, the Naxos quality is evident in the great sound.Highly recommended for classical music lovers."
1,Absence of java examples frustrating,"This book is basically Microsoft propaganda for their Biztalk.If you do MS Biztalk and use exclusively MS tools, this is your book.The soap spec in the appendix was the only useful part of the book."
2,"Extremely dry, sterile and boring.","The first Tinfoil to Stereo contained many errors, but it was a fun book to read. This one was written presumably to correct the first one but in the process all the meat was removed leaving only unpalatable bone. To make matters worse the book ended in the mid 1950's leaving one with the feeling that the second half was missing.I collect phonographs for enjoyment and to have fun. This book induced thoughts of a totally sterile environment which abounded with facts sans enjoyment. If you found the previous sentence enjoyable, read this book."
2,BORING!,"As a recording engineer by profession, the promise of this book was absolutely thrilling. And while I did enjoy some tastey morsels, it was so painful getting to them. For me it WAS worth the trouble reading this book, but the ratio of interesting to tedious was much lower than I had hoped.The book wasn't just dry. It was a labor to read. Imagine the worst features of history and intellectual property case law -- combined.The author can be commended for detailing the complex dealings within the recording industry of the past. I just wish the writing had some hint of passion for the subject. Too bad."
1,Nonsense,"This movie doesn't make a lot of sense. The motivation of the principal actor remains completely unclear up to the very end of the movie. In addition, he looks more like a US Marine than a Native American. The only notable performances come from Adam Beach and the congenial Raul Trujillo. Trujillo would deserve to get better roles!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,Very slow and we lost interest. Never even finished the entire movie.The scenery is however beautiful.
4,The Song of Hiawatha,"An interesting look into the authors portral of the legend of Hiawatha, who above all else dedicated him very being for the good of his people. His conflict with intertribal weakness was an interesting incertion, which help the story."
2,Disappointed,"Definitely not adult fare, though perhaps suitable for young children. I expected more. The acting, with a few welcome exceptions, was stale. There were some interesting landscapes and sets, but the special effects were weak, some reminding me of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""."
1,Get Smoke Signals instead,"First off I'd like to commend all the native American actors that were in this film. They did their best with one dog of a script. With that said I can now say that I'm embarrassed for anyone involved with this project. Did the film make sense? No! I'm just so flustered I can't write anymore, except to say, ""We need more films like Smoke Signals!"" Get Smoke Signals instead. You won't be disappointed."
3,Hiawatha,"Episodes are not well integrated - the story does not flow. Images are too literal and shallow. When the corn came and they tasted it they somehow knew exactly how to eat the kernels. If I had been presented with a strange new food such as an ear of corn, I would have taken a bite out of the top. Characters were never adequately developed to become real, and engaging. Situations failed to explore the depth of the poem. Maybe a good high school intro to the classic."
2,Too dark,"""Before I forget"" is a depressing, dark and, in some moments, very slow picture. I am pretty sure it won't get a wide audience due to its plot which concerns around life of old fags (one of them being former giggolo).World (shrinks, hustlers, whining old gays, cash cash cash) presented in this movie is completely unattractive to me, thus my low rating."
4,"Avoid ""Blue""'s Review!","Lovely film, gorgeous central performance, this is poignant and moving. But for f***'s sake don't read ""Blue in Washington""'s 'review', s/he has the thoughtlessness to reveal, as s/he puts it, the content of ""the final few frames"". Are you simply trying to prove you actually watched the entire movie, ""Blue""? Why else would you risk ambushing others' enjoyment without even the courtesy of indicating ""spoiler ahead"" at the top of your review???"
5,Very imaginative!,"This may not be the most accurate account of Mary Magdalene, but it sure is the most interesting. If you are looking for great fiction and will realize that this is purely fiction brought to life by the author's imagination, you will enjoy this book."
5,Magdaline takes you there,Very well written. Highly recomend this enthralling story of this historic time and personalities. I learned so much more about the culture of the time when Christ lived as man on. the earth. A historic fiction based on the true story.
5,Very Interesting Book!,The Biblical skeleton of Magdelene's story is accurate and Mrs. Hunt has put ficticeous meat on those bones that really could have happened. It was very thought provolking in light of all the various ideas of who she was and what were all the circumstances. A very interestin book.
3,Good read,I really enjoyed this book. Such a different perspective to read from Mary's point of view the events of the day. It's nice to try to put yourself in the time and place and see things through the eyes of someone who lived it.
5,Wonderful book!,Angela Hunt write such a wonderful books about biblical characters. She brings so much life to them and really brings out their personality. It is exciting to get the book free!
3,Not Her Best..,"I was anxious to read this book, because I wanted to read something from the Christian persuasion that didn't portray Mary Magdalene as Jesus' wife or lover. Well, it did accomplish that, but the story is contrived and the flow is not as good as most of her books. I am normally a huge fan of Angela Elwell Hunt books, but this one doesn't compare to most of them. Save your money and buy Uncharted, instead."
4,Good Knife,"The knife is good, but I felt that it was too bulky, and i disliked the spring mechanism, I'm more of a classic non-assisted folder guy."
4,"great knife, obtrusive lock","The Flash II is a really great knife, particularly the assisted opening.BUT, the lock is a real liability in a self-defense situation. The lock doesn't really stay in the ""off"" position. If you carry it in your pocket long enough the lock will activate itself, preventing you from quickly opening the knife. In an emergency, this could mean the difference between life and death.However, this problem is rather easily solved. Just remove the 5 hex screws on the side of the knife, take one of the handles off, and you'll find that the little red lock is not attached to anything and very easily removed. Put the handles back together, screw on the hex screws, and you're done. Yes, it really is that simple.I hope this helps anyone out there who was wondering what to do about the lock situation."
5,Awsome,"This knife exceeded my expectations. It is very solid, and opens super quick. Easily concealable. I highly recommend for any purpose."
1,SOG Knives are total junk,"I purchased 3 sog knives and have had to return all of them for warranty repair. The older sog knives were great I have an old one I purchased about 5 years ago and I am still using it. The new ones are made very cheap. I have not even had a chance to use them and they are all defective. After a few uses the spring assist stops working and you will have to return it for warranty work.Nothing against this seller, they are very good but sad to say the SOG knives are junk. Dont waste your money on it."
1,Blade Did Not Open,"I obviously have a defective unit because the blade is locked down and will not open. The blade safety is off but the safety slider does not quite cycle as clean as it should, meaning it is stuck in the ""safe"" position. Also got a Trident from SOG to see which I like better and it opens fine.Quite surprised that a new knife from a ""premium"" manufacturer would arrive unable to open. You would think for the price they would at least have someone open and close each before packaging to make sure they work. Missing a small defect I could understand...but something so fundamental tells me quality control is grossly inadequate. What else did they miss?Mine is going back for good."
4,Present for Dad,"My dad isn't a technology nut, nor a hardcore knife-guy, and he loves this thing. The easy-assist blade release is awesome, and your can lock it if there are kids around or you just want protection.Admittedly, for $40+, you'd think you'd get a slightly nice plastic shell. That's my only beef. It feels like a toy."
4,Great knife for the price.,"For the price and blade quality, you can't beat this knife. It has a great edge. I'm not to crazy about the pocket clip being on the butt end of the handle but its a nice low profile so I can live. The handle is comfortable and thing. The blade is a little thin for my taste but that also helps with it being light weight. Overall I would recommend this knife."
1,don't pay extra for shipping,"Don't pay extra for faster shipping. I did and my order was pushed back 4 days, Why does Amazon fudge the shipping? I'll stick with my usual vendors. At least I can call them and talk to a person."
5,Use it everyday,"This is a fantastic knife, and is just the right size for use with a few bigger jobs, without being so bulky that you can still carry it around wherever. The assisted open is fantastic, and is very quick and reliable, and the knife just stays sharp, period. I use it everyday, even for a lot of things that I shouldn't (I used the back of the blade a few times when I didn't have a flathead screwdriver available to me), and it still cuts perfect. I have been using it for almost a year now, and have had 0 problems. This is actually my second one of these, as I lost the first, and I will buy another if that were to happen again. I highly recommend."
4,High quality and very handy tool,"SOG is known for making high quality knives and tools and this knife is no exception. Very lightweight and well designed, it works quite well as an everyday carry knife. It's easy to forget it's in your pocket due to it's light weight but when it comes time to use it I really appreciate the full sized blade and easy handling. The blade deployment with the SOG Assisted Technology (SAT)feature could not be easier and smoother. All-in-all a great knife and an excellent purchase."
4,Good product,"Well made, light, extremely easy to carry in practically any pocket. Opens almost as fast as a button operated flick knife. It has some wiggle, though, and for that reason I can't give it five stars."
4,Awesome tactical blade for the price.,"I have several knives, and I rotate out regularly. Sometimes I carry more than one blade. I have some really expensive tac knives, and for the money, this is a pretty darn good blade. The assisted opening is really fast. It's almost a ""switchblade."" The blade quality is excellent, and the serrations are a good addition. I prefer a smooth blade for some things, but having the option of cutting a seat belt or rope is good. It's size is perfect, and for as big as it seems, it's really light. Great knife. I'd definitely recommend it."
4,Like a hot knife in butter.,"This is probably the best knife of it's type being produced today. I like the locking mechanism which prevents unintentional opening. The design was well thought out, and fits well in my hand. The blade assisted opening (S.A.T.) is very convenient.My only reservation is that the blade is slightly smaller than I am use to. I prefer a knive with a blade closer to four inches. However, this blade stays remarkably sharp."
2,Nice knife but go find another,"I have owned this knife just under two years and I can say that this knife is very dependable, feels great in your hand, stays sharp and clips into your pocket comfortably. However, I will tell others to go find a different knife. There is one huge problem with this knife that makes all of the positive characteristics obsolete. While the blade is locked in the open position there is about a 1/4"" amount of play. The movement in the blade is not side to side, but up and down or in a open and closed direction. The amount of movement has increased with time and I will be getting rid of this knife entirely. I don't think I will ever buy a SOG again because of this product."
5,Best knife,"The best knife I have owned. I am a recreation director and use the knife daily. Fits in pockets and is not too big. Great for cutting ropes, opening boxes, etc..."
5,Excellent knife,"Length:: 0:52 MinsSOG Flash 2.5 knife is one of my favorites. It is made in the United States. It has a 3.5"" assist opening serrated blade. It is a very lightweight knife with a carrying clip. I had the 2.5"" blade SOG and it was just too small for an assist opening blade."
5,Great quality Knife at a low cost,This knife is high quality and the price on Amazon is unbeatable. The assisted opening makes all the difference not to mention the Zytel handle makes this knife extremely lightweight. the blade is razor sharp and so far it appears that it will stay that way for quite a long time. Great buy!!!
3,Awkward Safety Switch,"I admit I am not a knife aficionado. Ths SOG Flash II was the first knife I bought in years. I bought if from Amazon, so I didn't have a chance to handle it (big mistake). I liked what I saw in the pictures and the reviews were all very positive. When I took it out of the package, I had difficulty opening the blade. Don't laugh, the safety switch is very small, and I feel, in a awkward location. I can't remove this knife from pocket and quickly open it with one hand, I need two hands (maybe I'm a spaz). I have to hold it with one hand, flip the tiny safety switch with my other hand and then open it. I actually like everything else about the knife. It has a good feel, it's not too heavy, and it is razor sharp, but I don't bother carrying it. It's just too cumbersome. It has a place of honor on my dresser collecting dust. I suggest trying this knife in person before buying it."
5,Holy ****,"Light, sturdy design. Good balance and reversible pocket clip. By far the sharpest knife I've ever bought. Great spring assisted design with an easy closing mechanism that puts a liner-lock to shame."
3,Like it but . . .,"Others have already provided highly detailed reviews, but I will add some of my own impressions after receiving the knife today. There's a small amount of play in the blade before putting it to any tasks. The opening and locking mechanisms are easy to use and provide a very fast open. I'm disappointed with the handle though. It (the zytel handle) seems quite light. I would prefer it if it had more heft."
5,"My Guy higher on the ""Mr. Cool"" list with this Awesome Tool","My guy thought he was getting cologne, which he never uses. I asked him to open his gift in front of his guy friends, and you should have seen his eyes light up with excitement. The other guys also want such a cool gift and my guy shows it off to ALL his friends.Way C-O-O-L !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SOG Specialty Knives & Tools TFSA-98 Flash II 1/2 Serrated, Black TiNi"
5,love this knife,"i have had this knife since Feb. of 2005, and has never let me down yet. i have also never sharpened it and is still very sharp. i use it alot and when ever i need it. cut small wire with it. being in the automotive field and cutting valve stems with no problem. when i first got it i touched it to see how sharp it was and got a good slice on my thumb. overall it has been good, been through hell and is still in excellent shape and highly recommend it and im here to buy another one for spare."
4,Flash II KNife,I bought this knife for my day pack. It opens lightning fast and is very sharp. I haven't had much chance to use it. If you are looking for an everyday carry this knife is on the large side. I would recommend the Flash I for an everyday carry knife.
2,Not quite up to standard,"As an old fan of the band I have enjoyed listening to theCD, but to get the best of Restless Heart, you absolutely have to go back to the old albums. The spark is not quite there anymore, Sorry!"
4,hey I have it on vinyl,"I still have this edition on vinyl featured Purple guys like Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Glover, Lord. The recording was made in an alcoholic consume. many purple fans love it, this rare edition is a MUST for all purple fans."
4,Love NOW,"NOW vits are great. Love supporting them. The calcium pills can be a bit stinky in the bottle though. Otherwise, their products are perfect."
2,Not what I was hoping for,I was hoping this would had been similar to what you see on HGTV but it wasn't. It's very old and it wasn't quite as hands on. There was more talking about why they used a specific design that was already done instead of showing you the process and talking about it. It just wasn't my style and I didn't make it through 1 episode. It was boring and nothing about the hosts held my attention.
4,Riveting Setting & Strong Heroine,"This is the first of his four books (Single to Paris is the fourth). He creates a realistic setting and one holds one's breath as Rosie narrowly escapes capture in all the books. My only complaint, for which I give his books only four stars, is that he overdoes his descriptions of each and every road and street. What makes this especially frustrating is that not all are mentioned on the map encluded. I adore maps but not if most of the places mentioned are not listed!! Otherwise a good story which highlights the dangers all the women and men of the SOE (and our OSS) faced."
3,Just Soap,"I don't believe the caffine in this soap helped anyone awake in the morning; however, I like the minty smell."
3,Only order one!,"I purchased four of these soaps but only one was shipped in the box, even through it clearly states four for the shipped quantity on the package slip. I called the customer service number on the package slip and they said they couldn't help me (couldn't find my order even though I had a packaging number, account number, AND order number!), and gave me a ""different"" number for assistance which was the SAME number as the one on the package slip!! So, I'm working through Amazon to get some resolution, but BEWARE!UPDATE: Working through Amazon, I was able to get the other three bars of soap. They came within a week of the first bar. The soap itself smells great and I certainly recommend that...maybe just not from this seller."
1,Another money making scheme from this C rated artist,"If it wasn't for that NEA controversy, Finley would just be some C-list artist that makes every art student hate performance art.From her CDs, to her books, to her 1900 number, Finley puts out bad art, funded in part by Non-Profits in awe of her NEA battle decades ago, in order to earn herself a pretty penny at the expense of intellectual art.Listen to the free Amazon tracks above for an example of adolescent-at-best, self indulgent, shallow ranting."
3,"Not as good as ""Battlelines""","I've enjoyed listening to John Wetton for a number of years. He's made great music with Asia and UK. Some of his solo stuff and the Wetton/Manzanera stuff has been so-so. However, I was very impressed with ""Battlelines"" and didn't think I would ever get a copy of ""Arkangel"". I was hoping ""Arkangel"" would be ""Battlelines Part 2"" but it's not. Where many of the songs on ""Battlelines"" (like ""Crime of Passion"", ""Hold Me Now"", and the title song) jump out at you, ""Arkangel"" only has a few songs with the same emotional punch. I like ""The Last Thing On My Mind"", ""I Can't Lie Anymore"", ""Arkangel"", ""Emma"", and ""Nothing Happens For Nothing"". This album seems slightly darker than ""Battlelines"" but does occasionally rock out. The main problem with the album is that you won't remember many of the songs after you play them unless you go back and play them a few more times. The album does grow on you. It's just a shame you have to play it so many times to remember the music."
3,Suspense story,"In this movie, Meg Tilly plays a struggling young artist who is hired by an extremely wealthy widow, Ellen Burstyn, to paint a large ballroom. What appears to be a dream job gradually turns into anything but as Burstyn's character's manipulative and bizarre behavior emerges. Barnard Hughes plays a friend of Tilly in a relatively small character part but the movie is almost entirely centered on Tilly and Burstyn.Both actresses are very good in their parts, espcially Tilly. Like many suspense movies, this one will have many moments when the viewer asks ""Why doesn't she just leave?"". This is an entertaining movie, not a great one and it will certainly fans please fans of Meg Tilly as she is onscreen almost every moment of the movie."
1,Don't insult the Prince,"True Prince fans will find this CD as an insult to The Artist Formally Known as Prince. If you are going to do a tribute make it worth while. While most of the songs sound like 80's retro techno..only two songs save this CD. Adeva does a funky dance remake of 1999 and Rebecca Romin Stamos does a great (lesbian) version of Darling Nikki. The rest of the songs are truly a waste of time. There is no heart and soul in cuts like I Would Die For You, Pop Life, or Controversy. I do give a hand to Buddy Miles for his take on Baby I'm a Star. 3 out of 13 selections does not provide a real positive tribute. Next time get some real artist that can sing to real music."
3,Mixed Bag...Mostly Coal,"As you can see from the other reviews, this album seems to have a track or two for each listener, while the rest is apparently garbage. For me, the hands-down winner is, oddly enough, Sigue Sigue Sputnik's ""I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man."" I honestly can't get enough of it, and it makes the whole album worth the price of admission. Honorable mentions go to Rebecca Romijm for ""Darling Nikki,"" which isn't exactly brilliant, but the backing band is solid and her delivery is suitably sexy, and Dead Or Alive's ""Pop Life,"" which sounds exactly what might have happened if Prince had offered this song to an '80s synth-pop band. Not brilliant or anything, but interesting. And that's this album in a nutshell - not brilliant, but interesting. Two stars for the bulk of the tracks, five stars for Sigue Sigue, so a three star overall. Well worth the buck from the used sellers, particularly for people who make mixes and like to have a library of odd-ball covers to pull from."
1,Waste of Money,Gary Numan doing a Prince song? You do the math-- and I like Gary Numan.There is little here that does justice to the originals. A complete waste of your money. Seriously.
1,a bad bad joke,"prince deserves better than this.if you want a true tribute get D'angelo,Maxwell&T boz and keep buddy miles.getting has-beens&3rd tier actors is a bad bad joke.this must be warner brothers doing.no wonder why prince got out of dodge? who else's music will be trashed next? you know it's the Puffy Era."
4,Batten down the hatches! Heavy Waves Ahead!,"Are we heading into the biggest depression of all time? Is it preventable? Who will be affected the most?GUESS! Mr. Arnold addresses these and many more questions in this book. His analysis is so simple enough that anyone can understand why there is cause for concern. With the amount of debt being financed by the US and taken on by other countries, we are definitely waiting for the great vacuum to suck in every investor. From Social Security deficit to the GOld Standard, Arnold hands out reason enough for every American to reconsider their investment strategy and think long term, very long term!This is required reading for every American.Mason JohnsonPresident, www.TomorrowsGold.comYour Online Source for Gold News, Knowledge, and Resource Links"
3,Not Bad But Too Short and Too Extreme,"Let me start by saying that this is a pretty good book for the price and if you don't know what is going on in the economy. The problem is that the book has very limited data to back up the predictions. If you are going to make huge predictions you had better justify it with a lot of credible data that has been referenced. As well, some of the predictions are just too extreme. However, all of these shortcomings aside, the author provides a nice short treatment on what will most likely occur; just not to the extent he has presented in my opinion. Of course, opinions are like debt in America - everyone has their own!A much more useful book in my opinion is ""Cashing in on the Real Estate Bubble."" It not only shows you many different ways to profit from the current bubble collapse, but it also shows a lot of detail about the economy and how to profit from America's overall credit bubble.Cashing in on the Real Estate Bubble"
3,Another dire prediction,Interesting statistics but the time has come and gone and the bust is not here yet. Neither is the end of the world orthe second coming of Christ. Many are still waiting. I'm grabbing another Miller Lite.
1,Book based on a false premise,"The main idea behind this book is that a particular age group (45 to 54 yo) are soon to be withdrawing their money from the market, which will make a huge hole in it and cause a crash. This can only work if there will be no one to replace these people. The fact is, more people are being born and living longer who will replace these people.I am not saying there won't be another crash, simply that the theory this book is based on is far too simple and incorrect. The market has never been seriously affected due to one event only, but always because of a variety of things happening at the same time."
2,No Dow Snap Back,"Although I agree with Mr. Arnold's ultimate conclusion and found his demographic research useful, it should be apparent now that the increase in the DJIA, which the author asserted ""must happen,"" has not materialized.Where has all the money gone? Another new bubble has been created- this time in real estate.I suggest digging your financial foxhole now."
3,Some time the truth will hurt if you don't respond.,As a 78 year old man I can still rember the tines in the thirtys (1934 up) I've read this book three times to absorb all thats in it. Things are sure to be worse consitering the debt the government has imposed on our children & grand children. I think the debit is now 7.8 Trillion & climbing. We didn't have that debit in 1929. Thank You.Frank Dietz
3,"One Dimentional, Short, and To The Point","If you are into reading economic doom and gloom books, this will provide some interesting reading. The Coming Generational Storm, The Party's Over, and The Dollar Crisis are all recommended if that is your cup of tea.The book pretty much maps a graph of the number of 49-year-olds over the years with the performance of the stock market. The graphs do correlate well and suggest a good stock market until 2010-2012 when the market will crash. There, I just told you the entire contents of the book. It makes no mention about the dollar crisis, the energy crisis, or the generational crisis."
4,Excellent Read,"Pros:1. Brief: to the point, no fluff book(let)2. Logical: Numbers support theory all along3. Simple: Easy to understand4. Value: Could save your shirtCons:1. May sound too negative2. May not consider all factors into forecasting"
4,Pretty close for a 2002 prediction,"This book is a small 55 page (large type) book that can be read in about thirty minutes. The author uses lots of graphs and census data to support his theory that the US economy simply follows the demographics of the 45 -54 year old US population. Although the concept sounds strange at first, he does a good job of supporting his claims with data.The most interesting thing about the book is that it was written in 2002 and called for a market peak around the 2012 period and then a huge fall off and then all sorts of h3ll, death, and destruction. Perhaps his dates were off by a few years but it would be hard to predict Fed intervention (which is probably just accelerating the dates.) I think it would be hard to forecast 10 years in the future and anticipate the crazy response from the Fed and Congress. Nevertheless, the book was thought provoking and adds another good data point to the warnings from many knowledgeable types that we are in for a rocky road ahead."
2,Interesting theory but...,"This book is short and easy to read. The author has an interesting concept that the stock market follows the number of Americans at their peak buying age. His graphs and explanations on modifying factors make everything fit. I agree that some correction of our economy (inflation, recession, or worse) is likely in the future, but I feel other factors (energy issues, our national debt, terrorism, etc.) will come into play that he has not taken into account. I also don't agree with his investment suggestions and feel they may be reckless.If you're concerned about possible bad times ahead, this is one book that may helpful, but I better liked the reasoning and proposals on what to do in Stephen Leeb's bookThe Coming Economic Collapse: How You Can Thrive When Oil Costs 200 Dollars a Barrel."
5,Very logical description of the BIG PICTURE,"I thought this book was very informative and logical. I think that the ""experts"" sometimes get lost in the details and completely ignore the BIG PICTURE. It's like they are laying sandbags along a swelling river in front of them and ignoring the growing leaks in the big dam behind them. I realize that this is not an exact science, but the author seems to recognize that as well. Given recent events, he is looking pretty smart right now.Though the thought of a coming bust is troubling in some ways, I found this book to offer some hope. The author not only outlines the reasons for the coming downturn but offers good ideas for avoiding financial catastrophe. I only wish that I had read it a few years ago."
4,This booklet has some good points,"The ideas in this booklet have some ground. I wouldn't swear by the correlation between demorgaphics and Dow Jones Index, but there is some sense. Worth reading to be better prepared for the upcoming events."
4,Definitely worth reading,"It is hard to rate this book. At only 54 pages, it is little more than a pamphlet really. Still, this is all the space the author needed to make his point - and a very interesting point at that. It is hard to deny that his arguments have the ring of truth. In his book, the author does not plug any financial services or related books or anything like that. In fact, much of what is in the book is free of charge on his website (http://www.thegreatbustahead.com/).I worry about his prediction that we will emerge from this depression around 2025. With the peak oil situation, I wonder if we will EVER emerge again into a familiar world. One way or another, the future is going to be tough, folks. Books like this only ask you to be prepared. Well worth reading."
1,Disappointing [short book],"The author basically has only one theory to discuss in this [short book], and once presented in the most simplistic of terms, he does not feel the need to discuss it further. His theory is that the DJIA can be predicted based on the numbers of 45-54 year olds - ""big spenders"" as he calls them. When the numbers of this age group goes down, so will the economy. The rest of the book describes in overly dramatic terms (complete with excessive exclamation points and bold print) just how bad the depression will be when the numbers of this age group declines. The author predicts the worst depression in history will occur sometime after 2010 (when the numbers of ""big spenders"" will decrease significantly.) Then he throws in a paragraph or two about what to do before the depression (invest in stocks) and just prior to the depression (sell your house by 2010 and invest in Treasury bonds.) That's it."
3,US Population Only?,"When you consider we now operate in a global economy, looking at just US demographcs is faulty. I am much more concerned about an ageing Chinese and Indian population than an ageing European and US population. Luckily the demographic bomb in Asia is farther away than that in the US and Europe, by some 20 years. It's implications are far worse however. In any event, one should look at global demographics rather than local demographics when analyzing macro-economic trends such as GDP growth rates."
4,Worth the Read,Daniel Arnold has some great information in this easy to read book. However his recommendations for the future are very slim - hence the name of the book implying the heralding of the doom. One important factor that he doesn't mention in the book is the fact that when the collapse happens treasury bonds will be a safety net however having enough food and water at hand will be the order of the day.
2,"Cool Cover, Fun Writing Style, No Actual Content","I was drawn to the book because of it's fun approach to what are often dry subjects. What I found on the inside were a few good jokes and lot of shallow assumptions. I can't see a benefit to anyone that is seeking any sort of actual understanding of the issues discussed. This book will serve the truly dedicated that are seeking solely to reaffirm their faith, not to actually learn. If it were not for the humor in the book I would have given it one star. If you must buy the book, get the Kindle version, at least you will save a few dollars."
5,"Inspiring...And, of course, VERY FUNNY","I used to be a christian religious fanatic...Then, about 7 years ago, I had a tragedy in my life that turned me off to the whole 'God' thing. I wondered how a loving God could allow something so hurtful to happen to myself and those effected around me.When I read this book, it inspired me to give God another chance... John's convincing argument that God has to allow evil if he is to allow free will in this world showed me that God isn't necessarily evil and cruel just because of my experience. He, instead, is loving and patient and humane.Thanks, John, for your inspiring story."
1,outdated,Back in the 90's I would have found this book funny. Today it just seems trite and shallow. Not worth the read.
4,Christians can have a sense of humor too!!!,"I enjoyed this book. It was refreshing to read a book with a spiritual message that was not ""preachy"" but down-to-earth. Often times, when I am done reading a book with a christian message, I feel like a child that has just been given a lecture. This was nothing like that. It was thought provoking and intelligent. It was also funny. It was nice to know there are fellow christians out there that remember that God gave us a sense of humor and it is nothing to be ashamed of. I recommend this book for both believers and non-believers of any age, but I especially think that generation X needed something like this."
3,Interesting premise but long winded as usual,"I have read much of Greg Bear's work and the same criticism applies to this book as to all the rest: It' too long! Not a lot actually happens in the book but you'd never know it by its length. This book would be fantastic if it were about 200 pages shorter. He explores some interesting concepts and writes some good hard science fiction, but between the brilliant moments are chapters of superfluous filler that are pointless and make the story much longer then it has to be. Many chapters were hard to plow through because they were just so boring. What would otherwise be an excellent 200 page book is a mediocre 400 page book. Maybe the publisher makes him pad the book because longer books sell better or something, I don't know. I believe a book can have a great plot and wonderful character development and still be concise (see Isaac Asimov). Overall, it was a decent book, worth reading once, but I'd never pick it up again."
3,"A good book, not a great book.","The beginning and end of this book are ""5's."" Between that, and the epilogue are ""2's."" The character's weren't that fascinating either. Few of the characters were believable, the main character, Arthur Gordon, just giving in to the aliens, come on, shsssh. Like I said the beginning and endings were excellent. Quite a hook, when the first scene describes a scientist getting a phone call telling him a moon of Jupiter has disappeared. The ""end"" of the world was quite moving too. In between, oh well, ho hum."
5,A classic from the eighties,"The eighties produced a lot of really good science fiction. It was perhaps a third wave in the modern genre, anfter the blind belief in progress of the fifties, and the dystopian visions of the sixties and seventies. Greg Bear is but one great name of that era. He wrote several very different books. Perhaps Forge of God is one of the best. Bear is here reminiscent of Clarke with his vision of a wast uncaring universe which impacts on an unsuspecting humanity. He does introduce hope, as a few humans are saved - not out of any altruism, but as recruits in the hunt for the shadowy civilization that runs amok among the stars.Many characters in the book die. I think he wants to stress that hope and success go hand in hand with failure and disappointment. And, sometimes, being a little person, your part tend to be little, but it is still an important part.This book has served as an inspiration for the fim Independence Day."
3,"Good concept, but flawed writing and a touch too long","I thought the concept behind this story was very good, and it is a very imaginative plot. However, the writing was not as good as I would have liked. The dialogue was especially simplistic, trite, and sometimes hokey. And it could have been edited down a bit as well. I could definitely see this as a sci-fi film though. With a good screenwriter who could pare down the excess and improve the dialogue, this could make for a pretty engrossing film."
2,Slow slow slow,"Oh my gosh this book is slow. I made it half way through then gave up. By then I had taken to skimming with short pauses to read when it got interesting. If you like fast-moving action then I can't recommend this book to you, at least not the first 200 pages. There are a few interesting developments in the first half of the book, but it's mostly extraneous description and dialog that do not advance the plot. Endless speculation about what might be happening. Long descriptions about characters that I don't care to read about. People talking on and on pointlessly. It's maddening because you want to know what's going on but that core part of the plot unfolds very very slowly. I read the back cover of the sequel, Anvil of Stars, so I know how Forge ends but I have now unfortunately lost any enthusiasm for these two books."
2,"This is not a critique of the text, but the presentation.","After being told that I should read this series I decided to do so. I previewed this digital edition, and then purchased the full version. I'd noticed some grammar and punctuation problems with the text. Nothing major, but errors still. After a coup1e of chapters it became more obvious what these errors appeared to be: 0CR problems with similar characters being confused (B becomes 13, for example). Every chapter, every sub-chapter had some of these and they became increasingly annoying. It's as if either the publisher didn't bother proofing this before submitting it, or this was not submitted to Amazon by the actual publisher.If you're a pedant and/or don't appreciate lazy publishers, pass thi s one up and pick up the paper copy.A Note, three examples of the errors have been intentionally inserted into this review. If you spotted them immediately and/or they annoy you after you spotted them, get the paper copy."
1,Girly-men burst into tears as they await the apocalypse,"If you want to empathize with weepy girly-men as they await the apocalypse, this one's for you. This chick-lit story tells us all about every minor character's emotions, appearance, attitude and thoughts, even when they don't matter. Passive, helpless men burst into tears at the slightest excuse. Characters are acted upon, rather than act to survive. The aliens are never shown and their machines are harmless. There is no attempt by humanity to survive. Everyone just sits around singing hymns, pontificating and looking at the scenery. The suspense at the start of the novel promising so much is squandered in meandering and meaningless plot twists, none of which goes anywhere. If you are one of those who want to slip into the skin of decent, strong characters striving to survive in a world gone mad, then trySisters of Glassor early Jack Vance."
2,2012 meets Lucifer's Hammer minus cannibals minus realism,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***Our planet is going to be destroyed. The aliens set up distracting arrivals but it's never clear why the distractions are important as there would be nothing we could do to prevent the destruction. The dialog and intervening scenes are so blatantly filler that it becomes impossible to turn the pages fast enough to avoid the deadening while tracking the plot. This was surprising both because Bear has written some good ones and also because he received (so he acknowledges) advice from several experienced SF writers. Unfortunately, I would recommend many of the $0.99 SF novels on Amazon before recommending this one."
3,Sci Fi,"It's OK, not a keeper. It gets pretty boring at times. Bear is usually better than this. Stick to Ringo and Weber."
4,A fragmented view of doomsday,"Aliens arrive to the Earth, with the intent of methodically dismantling the planet: the novel starts pretty incoherently, too many plot points, too many actors, too many information crumbs here and there, but when it reaches its final climax it manages to pull its act together and I find myself caring for both the heroes and Earth itself; which is a good thing. Probably if nanomachines started destroying our world, it would be like this - though I prefer the more ""usual"" approach, death by comet (Lucifer's Hammer) and Niven's extremely detailed and more linear style."
3,Novella on Steroids,"If this book were a 150 page SciFi novella, I'd give it 5 stars. Unfortunately the publishers encourage bloated beach novels. Bear does his patriotic duty :) Since The evil Aliens cannot be stopped why are we subjected to 250+ pages of characters wandering around aimlessly. I agree with another review: read the first and last 25% and skim the rest. Follow this advice and you will experience an excellent Novella."
4,Great sci-fi book,"I'm surprised by the some of the reviewers that said the book was overlong and boring. I thought it was fairly well written ""hard sci-fi"" novel with ok, but in some cases, weak sub-plots. The author did do a good job getting me to care and I was affected by the ending.The explanation and descriptions of the science seemed plausible and I enjoyed the descriptions very much."
3,Forge of God,The story is original and character development helps with this story but the technical information on astronomy and geology is at a high level and should have been brought down to enable a better understanding of how the forces at work were destroying earth. Overall I enjoyed reading this book I will probably read more of Greg Bear's writing.
4,"Goodbye, Earth!","There are a number of books that deal with the topic of how humans will face the future once there is definitive proof that ""we are not alone."" In The Forge Of God, Earthlings don't get much time to mull this over.Space transports suddenly appear on the planet. The entities that emerge from these transports are not identical, and carry different messages, of hope or utter destruction. Who do you believe?Contrary to the Star Wars-type planet busters, planetary destruction is not a simple process. Greg Bear plots out a process and mechanism for this. Are we that powerless? Are others that powerful?In The Forge of God, readers are introduced to The Law, which is a major part of the sequel to this story,Anvil of Stars. I didn't even know the book had a sequel, and that discovery was pleasant. The Forge Of God itself reads as a complete, independent story.Enjoyable as a story, not as a prediction of the future!"
3,"gripping, yet dissatisfying and overly long","This novel started strong, as the aliens ""invade"" and sceintists and politicians attempt to deal with it. Actually, as other reviewers have revealed, it's more of an execution than an invasion. Two thirds of the way through the book I sudddenly realized ""Hey, they're not actually going to save the earth, are they?"" Okay, so I was a little slow on the pickup. From that point on I realized that there really wasn't any point at all to any of the plot twists and characterizations that had already happened or were yet to come. Still, Bear kept it interesting and I actually finished the book in a couple of days. But I would not recommend this book as it requires an emotional investment, then kicks you in the stomach for a payoff."
3,Mother Earth?,Didn't do much for me. A average read of alien invasion of earth. It's sort of a mystery on who is doing what to whom. Who are the good guys and who are the bad? The best part of the whole book was the theories of one character on what was going on. Sort of a Mother Earth type theory. Very provacative.
3,some sf novels do get better than this.,"1. If you are ""into"" sf, this book deserves reading. 2. The end of the earth scenes make you remember the book which through them manages whispering you after you part with it, uniqe in books, i dare say. 3. The book IS a rush, you run almost ""amok"" reading it. 4. The charachters are quite credible. 5. The pilot is ""weak"" . 6. The main problem, as with the ""anvil of stars"" is, the book is not a clever one. It has gaps, some quite concrete and deep, which reminds you meals looking good - served well but you certainly decide to be less than ""tasty"". The development of the story is less than average. No well defined and sized bookmarks around depicting the steps of the story, you read on and on. 8. Thank you bearing with my review."
4,jacket summary,"from the back cover of the June 1988 Tor paperback editionjacket art by Alan GutierrezJune 26, 1996: One of Jupiter's moons disappears.September 28, 1996: A geologist near Death Valley finds a mysterious new cinder cone in a very well-mapped area.October 1, 1996: The government of Australia announces the discovery of an enormous granite mountain. Like the cinder cone, it wasn't there six months ago..."
1,A Good Book but $9.99 is ridiculous,"The Forge of God is a classic, but it was published TWENTY years ago. Don't you think that is is rather greedy to charge $9.99 for it? Buy a paperback version for 25 cents"
3,only because i had to for school,"I read this book for a college class I'm in right now. The book itself was well writen and easy to follow, minus the scientific crap. The plot I found to be well described yet most of the details were useless. The book could and should have been summed up sooner but due to wordy-ness it wasn't. Having read no other sf books I cannot form an opinion on his writing except for this book. I believe it had the potential to be better and for that reason I gave it 3 stars. If you have to read it for school or whatever else well, have fun. If your reading or going to read it for fun I suggest you should reconsider your choice."
5,An unforgettable masterpiece,"I read The Forge of God years ago. I've never forgotten it. It remains one of the finest pieces of fiction I've read. It attracts you into a thoroughly researched, fully imagined near-future and fires your imagination as it hurtles you straight into the ultimate horror. It's Bear's best, and I've read a ton of his stuff. Don't miss it."
3,Not bad but......,After having read this is one of the all time classics I was a little dissapointed but I did enjoy the story overall. There's some cool concepts explored of the motives and methods of the Earths alien invaders. The story has enough twists and turns to keep it interesting but is never truely involving to the reader. I would say just worth the buy.
5,my Frodo,I am always looking for anything LOTR so when I saw this of course I had to have it and add it to my collection it's great and hope to find more of the same kind of thing
3,Enjoyable - but the not best of the Bolithos,"It would surely have been over-optimistic of Richard Bolitho to have expected that the brief period of the Peace of Amiens might have afforded him a degree of rest and recreation - and, sure enough, he finds himself embroiled in treachery, dilemmas and fights to the death in the West Indies and the North Atlantic. There is action aplenty in this story - almost too much of it - and compared with many of the earlier works in the saga the plot seems a little contrived. Though not the best of the series it is however always entertaining and the usual cast of characters make their appearance and act and develop credibly. Affecionados of Bolitho cannot afford to miss it and will look forward to further defeats of Bonaparte's global ambitions as renewed hostilities gather pace."
2,Mostly a history book.,"There was some good info here, but I was disappointed to find so much of the book (maybe half) is about rifle and cartridge history. I wanted more of a how-to book, not a history book."
4,The Hunter's Guide to Accurate Shooting,"Excellent book! Well written by an experienced and knowledgable shooter. Filled with common sense advice. An easy read. Useful for the shooter who knows it all as well as the beginner. Lacks lots of pictures to illustrate the principles, but I did not find this a problem as the writing is clear and comprehensible."
5,SWEET GUNDAM!!!,"I ordered Gundam MSZ-006C1 Zeta Plus C1 and got it in no time. Just got back in to Gundam models, this is my favorite so far. Loads of detail for this model. I really like the ""hydrolic lines"" in the leg joints. It also transforms into ""Wave Runner"" aircraft with landing gear which is sweet looking. Took me about 10 hours building including doing the decals and going through the panel gaps with an ultra fine black sharpee. I would highly recomend this Gundam. Definitly looks unlike any other. Best part; MASSIVE BEAM CANNON AND DUEL BEAM SABORS!"
5,time consuming,"I got this from the local anime store. It was alot more challenging to construct than other Master grade kits. It is a marvelous looking kit when it is done, but its arms and the leg guns dont want to stay on, and the butt armor wont snap in. I think that since these kits were developed years ago they are a bit lacking. I was missing quite a few ""PC"" rubber pieces from the molds. thankfully there were enough extra to substitute similar ""PC's"" in the jointsMAJOR NOTEThis is the first gundam kit I have ran into that has screws. you will need a small screwdriver like the ones for repairing electronics or eyeglasses to screw them in flush so the body panels can go over top.Overall this kit well exceeded my expectations. it is a FULL transforming kit, unlike HG Delta plus that has a separate piece to attach legs, arms and shield to in order to achieve flight mode.the unit stands at about 12"" tall and is almost 18"" long with a 10"" wingspan in flight mode."
4,The Glory Years by Margaret Miller,"It is no doubt Ms. Miller has knowledge of horses. I love the fact that ""The Glory Years"" is told from the horse's point of view. This is not just for young women who love horses, but mostly for people of all ages who have a special bond with a pets."
4,Excellent History,"The summary is a bit misleading (hence only 4 stars) in that it states that it will explain what it was like for people living in the time. It didn't do this (try reading Fever 1793, a fictionalized account of the yellow fever epidemic for this) but it did provide an excellent historical account of yellow fever and the attempt to deal with it. The book sometimes rambled, giving the history of where people were born and such, that was not important to the historical accuracy of the book but it was not annoying enough to make me stop reading. This is not a light read - I have no medical background and struggled with some of the terminology but found it a compelling account. The author did an excellent job of turning something that could be boring as sawdust and making it come alive as the men struggled to put an end to this devastating diease."
3,It's a post and will hold a mailbox.,"This post will serve the purpose, but there are nicer ones out there for about the same money. The rod that you hammer into the ground is fairly small, so if your yard is soft, it might have difficulty staying upright unless you embed the rod in concrete. Also, the board that the mailbox actually fastens to is made of untreated pine; granted, the mailbox will cover it and keep it somewhat protected from the elements, chances are it will end up rotting, which is bothersome considering the rest of post is cedar and will most likely never rot. I would recommend painting or varnishing the untreated pine board prior to fastening it to the main post."
2,Waste of time,"I bought this low priced pedal mainly for my daughter as a starter. To my surpise, there was no power supply included! Not even a battery. No mention on Amazon's product description that a power supply for the unit was not included. I also bought the other two models... One of them picks up a radio station and broadcasts it thru the amp, yet, there isn't a radio station tower within 5 miles of my house. All in all, I feel I got ripped off. If I had known they did not come with power supplies, I would not have purchased them."
5,Carefree Koolerz Mint Splash,My girlfriend loves this product and I wasn't able to find it anywhere!! I'm so glad that I found it on Amazon for a great price. It was delivered quickly!
5,Buy this!!,"This is my favorite documentary I have ever seen. If it looks at all interesting to you, but it. You won't regret it."
2,Too many unanswered questions,"I bought this after watching Season 4 of The Wire (for the second time), looking for another angle on possible solutions to the problems of kids in Baltimore. While ""Boys of Baraka"" is a documentary, not a television drama, I felt it didn't even meet the standards of daily mainstream journalism, let alone a documentary.This film is simple observation without insight or perspective. I did not get answers even to basic questions, such as how the school started, who started it, why the founders picked Baltimore and Kenya, who funds it, why almost all the teachers and counselors were white, what their background is ... etc. etc.I'm not asking for hyper-attitude Michael Moore here, but I expect more from a documentary than following people around with a camera. (Google to find Time article from Oct 2000 and recent article from Baltimore Sun)"
4,Yes - to be seen,"I liked the movie a lot, but felt something was missing. I felt that the story was very worthy of coverage and it was harsh that the program had issues, which were interesting to follow in devising new solutions. It, for me, was kind of sad to see minds ending up in such a mess - as portrayed in this movie.In addition to special schooling there should be special programs for parents. It is too bad that efforts like these are not done on a wider scale as many nations, especially the US, is willing to spend a billion dollars a day on a losing counterproductive war - but is not willing to spend a few million helping the brilliant families and minds of potential laden children that will be tomorrow's community leaders."
4,Excellent Movie,I watched it with my teenagers and we enjoyed it afterwards we had a positive discussion about the film.
3,Better altertative,"I bought this product along with the cusinart tongs, with a metal spring hinge. I found the cusinart to be eaiser to use for a wide varity of bread products then these tongs.However the cusinart doesn't have a magnet if that is important to you."
3,Back-up tongs.,"I just reviewed some bamboo toaster tongs, these were bought at the same time so we could choose which one to use first. The bamboo won ! These work OK, but they require more pressure to grab stuff :( The magnet to stick them up is a plus though."
4,Bagel tongs will prevent burned fingers,"I purchased this wooden bagel tong to remove bagel halves, english muffin halves, or toast from my toaster. It is a good tool to use to prevent fingers from getting burned from removing hot food items from the toaster. The tongs are well constructed. It has a magnet that will allow you to attach the tong to the side of a metal toaster. The disadvantage of the tong design is that you will have to place your hand closer to the tip to pick up thinner slices of bread. These tongs are also expensive for its simple design. This is why I rated this bagel tong 4 stars."
5,A wonderful inspirational CD!!,"I purchased this CD several years ago and it is one of my favorite relaxing CD's. I love Pachelbel's Canon and this is a refreshing mix of a classic. It encorporates the electronic music, with violin, and vocal. You don't get sick of it!!"
4,Not what i expected,"I was very surprised to find that this music is almost danceable...or rather that it is not the music that I expected which is that one could listen to it and relax and ponder one's proverbial naval. It is well done ,however, and would keep one awake if one needed to unlax. It is not for everyone but I have certainly kept it in my KEEPERS pile."
5,Most incredible CD's you will ever hear,"This is one of the most relaxing CD's you will ever listen to. Whenever I have friends over for dinner and we are relaxing around the fire with coffee, they ask that I play this CD. It is great for a wind down and couples find themselves cuddling up and falling in love again. Trust me, you will not be disappointed if you buy this CD!"
3,"If you like Pachelbel's Canon, there's a good chance you won't like this","Disappointing, given the mostly favorable reviews. Mediocre percussion and synthesizer overlaid on top of faintly recognizable bits from Pachelbel's Canon. Listen before buying."
4,Great book,This book really helped me sort out issues with class. The reference info is very usefull. I purchased this book as a kindle version. Many of the figures and PPs are too blurry to read clearly. Fortunately the figures and tables aren't critical to understanding the material.
5,A Must Read for Every Spirit-Filled Christian,"This book is one of Brother Hagin's best. It gets to the heart of motivation in ministry. Aptly titled, ""Plans, Purposes, and Pursuits"", this classic explores why many times God's will isn't being carried out on the earth. This a great book, but know ahead of time that some of the information in its pages is not without controversy. What you read may shock you."
4,Works for me.,"I purchased this book for school and it has served me well. It was just what I needed and it arrived in a timely manner. No complaints, works great."
3,"Conservative, old-school material, mostly checklists.","This book is not geared toward modern, big-ticket, ultra-risky venture capitalists. You won't find any eBay case studies here, nor any advice on how to finance such.Instead, the author's focus has a small-time, mezzanine debt flavor. Think lower-risk, low to mid-tech deals; smallish companies, such as printers, with existing business models and revenue streams, in search of expansion capital.The proposed structures are safe (secured, convertible debt) and the bulk of the book consists of due diligence checklists.The writer's conservatism is both the virtue and the limit of this book. Depending on your needs and beliefs, you'll find it either reassuring and methodical, or stodgy and old-fashioned."
4,Motel Lovers: Southern Soul from the Chitlin Circuit,"My father was from arkansas and when I was a kid this is the sounds around our house late at night, from 45's LP's, back in the 60's and 70's.After hearing the review on NPR it was a must have. In the morning I'm headed to arkansas seeking those clubs back in the woods that host these artists and thier music. Its sad that this is an import. After years of hearing radio's pop/rap/R&R; music, I feel a need to take part and understand where they all came from. see you on the circuit."
3,Not quite a Coleman big brother,Lighter weight than I thought it would be. 7 out of 8 wind shield screws had fallen out. They were installed with plumbers tape wrapped around the screws and still fell out even though the packing of the stove in the carton was good. The latch to hold the lid down had to be tightened so as not to fallout. Might go back to the thrift store and buy back my 15 year old Coleman as a back up. I thought the Brunton would be a step up.
5,No complaints,"We got this burner to replace a single burner stove my husband bought last year. This one looked more stable on the table. My husband, who's not very mechanically inclined, got this out of the box and put together all by himself, not that it looked very difficult. He hooked up the propane tank and had it running within minutes. The starter worked fine. The burner worked exactly as we needed it to. The windscreen is a nice addition which we didn't have with our last burner. I really have no complaints.After using the burner, the whole unit folded easily back down into an easy carry case. This was good value for the money and I'm glad we got it."
4,works great,"i have owned this stove for over a year and it has worked wonderfully for me, it's lightweight, easy to clean, and yes it dents if you drop it on the campground fire grate, but it still works fine !"
4,Great little camper stove.,"Took it out for a week while elk hunting with a friend.Good stuff. 2 burners was enough. Got the coffee hot quickly every AM, cleaned up in a jiffy."
1,a nice looking doorstop,"It seemed like a great idea: Accurate to 1 second every 60 million years!But i guess that should read, accurate every 60 million years!Even a broken clock is right twice a day, but because of this one's unpredicability and habit of moving rapidly on its own, its not even right twice.There's a setting for ""manually"" setting it, and I'm sure whatever genius designed it can do that, but normal earthlings will not be able to figure that one out.Where's the manual? Or user-friendly controls?I have better luck with my sun-dial.Steer clear of this one!PS. The atomic radio signal works fine, unless you happen to live in a house with walls. I recommend this clock for homeless people only."
2,Looks like a big white clock to me,"The photo on Amazon isn't representative of the product I received. The frame is white, or an extremely light silver. I also bought a LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock, which didn't match it's photo either, but at least I like it."
5,works like a clock!,"As it should, I suppose. We bought this to put in our 5-year-old son's bedroom. It has worked flawlessly so far. It's perhaps a bit large for a small bedroom, but our son seems to like it and it has kept perfect time so far, and that's what matters."
1,Will be a piece of junk after a couple years,I bought a dozen of them and gave them to all my friends for a purpose. Almost all the clocks stopped working when the time was changed in the first week of March. I did all I could do.
1,Lacrosse Technologies Equals Hideous Service,"We have a Model 2315 weather station from Lacrosse Technologies that worked for us for a couple of days, and then stopped working. We tried calling their help line, beginning 1/20/06, and it's true they tried to call us back 1/24/06, but I was unable to take the call at that moment. I called back a couple of times that same day and have yet to hear back from them. Pretty pitiful service! I tell anyone who's interested not to buy anything from Lacrosse Technologies.One reason I'm so irate is that their help line seems to be designed to infuriate their customers. In the early stages of a call, the caller is given the option of leaving a message or waiting for the next available service person. Then, after investing maybe ten minutes of one's valuable time waiting, it cuts you off and forces you to leave a message (which might be answered a couple of days later, but likely not)."
1,It didn't last a month.,"I purchased this as a present. Less than a month later, I went to wrap it, and found that most of the face of the clock had come unglued from its backing. There seems to be a quality control problem at the LaCrosse factory. I contacted the LaCrosse customer service satff about the problem and they wanted me to pay for shipping for warranty repair even though it was new. Fortunately I bought it through Amazon and they were responsive enough to pay for its return. Don't think I'll ask for a replacement."
1,La Crosse Replaced Clocks with Bad DST,"The face is made of paper and is poorly glued on causing ripples and warping.Although under normal cirumstances it receives a signal and adjusts to the signal properly, IT DOES NOT ADJUST FOR DST, thus making the clock virtually useless now. If you live in other time zones other then EST, you could at least choose a different time zone to compensate; if you live in the EST time zone you are SOL. Other than the DST issue clock has been very accurate.Update: La Crosse sent out new clocks to replace the ones that did not adjust for DST because of the new date changes. Any company that does this is tops in my book. Changing rating to four stars."
1,This clock does not keep the correct time,"When I purchased this clock, the directions made a specific point that, really, all you need to do is put a battery into the clock and it will begin working over the next 24 hours. It did begin working, but when faced with daylight savings time (east coast), it would keep the regular eastern standard time. (so for 6 months+ out of the year, the time is wrong!!) What's with that?? A clock that cannot give me the correct time is worthless!"
1,Great when it works,"I bought this in 11/2006. It automatically adjusted and kept precise time out of the box. That is until DST this year. It is 1 hour behind and will not adjust. They've issued some ""emergency"" instructions on their website that try to fix the issue but they don't work. Also, they say wait 5 days before contacting them if the clock doesn't adjust right away. 5 days to update? I have an atomic weather station and had no problems with it adjusting automatically to DST. Stay away from this model. It doesn't work for DST and most likely never will."
2,Analog La Crosse Atomic Wall Clocks,"In my experience the failure rate for Analog La Crosse Atomic Wall Clocks is 100% between 3 months -24 months. In the past few years I've purchased several analog La Crosse Atomic Wall Clocks. Each has worked fine at first but then after a relatively short time each has failed to display the correct time. I've tried new batteries, resetting, changing the time zones and moving the clock to a different location. Often the ""broken"" clock will return to the correct time but fail again within the next day or two. These clocks have been purchased for Glen Ellyn, IL and Jacksonville, IL. They are nice clocks but their working life is too short."
5,Wonderful Clock!,I like the clock because it has large black numbers and black hands. I have another atomic clock (for travelling) and it works great. I am hoping this one will work as well or better. Great gift for senior citizen or someone with impaired vision.
2,stop working a year latter,"I love this clock for it blends well with my walls, and it's been working almost perfect.Now it's dead . . . I mean dead. I replace the battery, reset and wait, and repeat with new battery for 2 weeks, it's dead."
2,Everybody is laughing!,"When I bought this clock, everybody in my house is admiring. Auto Daylight saving, clear finish, precise time etc. Now everybody is laughing out loud. My clock is an hour late than other clocks. I live in EST. Don't know how to reset manually either. Buy this clock at your own risk."
2,Clock radio is not sensitive,"We live along the pacific central cost about 1000 miles from WWV. We should have no problem getting the signal, but the clock has not worked well.When we got the clock we put a battery in but it never set itself. We contacted the company and were told to use a fresh Alkaline battery, not a rechargeable one. And apparently it needs to be super-fresh---with an exp date at least 6 years in the future.We got a new battery and put it in and the clock did not set itself for 3 days.Today is the change-over from Daylight Savings Time to Standard Time. The clock did not change over.Tech support for the company is weak. The company did not respond to emails. We called them and left a message on an answer machine. They called back, but a day later.I like having a clock that sets itself by radio, but I think that this clock needs either two batteries or a better antenna. And the company needs better tech support."
3,Neat Clock but...........................,I think i got this clock pretty cheap that's why i bought it. It is pretty neat that it sets it self automatically . i never have to worry about it until recently. i got this clock maybe 2-3 months ago. its now 11-9-06. i just notice that the Sec. hand is not moving anymore. I replaced the battery with a fresh one thinking it might be the battery but its not..the other hands are still keeping time though. its odd. its a good clock very clear and readable. i only gave it 3 stars cause in only 3-4 months it has already sort of broke.
2,Lasted only a year,"The second hand stopped working after a year (just after the warranty ran out!).In the first year, the clock worked fine except during the 2 days in the year when the time changed; on those days, the clock changed back/forth by an hour several times i.e. sometimes during the day it was off by an hour... weird!Like the look - hence the 2 stars."
4,Nice Clock !,"This is the first atomic clock that I've ever purchased. After reading all the reviews I thought I would give it a try. I took it out of the box and put the battery in just like everyone said...For some strange reason it didn't move at all even after an hour so I got worried..Then I went back to the instruction again and realized that I have to leave it at a place where it is six feet from any electronic or computer. I immediately placed it in a room near the window where there is no electronic device..and Voila..it reset itself after 30 minutes..I guess it was searching for the signal...Anyway, I like the idea that I don't have to worry about accuracy..and change the time during daylight savings..."
5,Great product,The clock is a great product and it came in record time. I would recommend buying from Amazon.
5,clocks,"These Atomic clocks are doing better than expected in our school that has trouble receiving cell phone calls.Good delivery, helpful company."
1,Deserves ZERO stars,"Here's what you get - a clock that doesn't sync to the new day light savings time beginning in 2008; non-existent customer service; and my warranty card was sent back to me stamped ""return to sender - address does not exist."" and to boot...you won't get your money back. I have purchased about 500 items on Amazon and have been completely satisfied with every purchase - except this one. This clock and this company Suck."
2,Takes 4-5 days to 'automatically' adjust Daylight Savings,"unbelievable, but true. you have to wait 4 or 5 days for this 'atomic' clock to adjust to daylight savings. during that time, you have to put up with having the wrong time on your clock. Here is their explanation..[...]"
3,They are okay,"Bought 4. All of them had problem with 2007 DST change. 1 remains unadjusted on 4/11/2007. Might have to RMA it. The clock face is a piece of vinyl, which is curling up around the edge."
1,back paper warps badly. New DST time is not working,Bad quality and not bad (or lie) info. New DST is not working. Doesn't matter how many days you are waiting.
1,Daylight Savings Time Nightmare!,"I don't blame the manufacturer, but U.S. Congress, but still...The clock has an internal computer chip which would not recognize Daylight Savings Time at the correct date.... meaning either the beginning or the end of DST. There was going to be such a delay to get a new chip and/or clock that we just returned the clock. Disappointed."
4,Ghost adventures,"I am a HUGE fan of Ghost adventures, after having watched every other ghost hunting show on television, I finally ran across this one. I really wanted to see the entire documentary since I have seen many other episodes. I really liked the documentary and as an added bonus I got a whole bunch of other movies, Some of them were kind of cheesy and boring but got the documentary and that is all i wanted."
2,It was OK,"It was OK not what I was expecting. I thought it had to do mostly with Ghost Adventures, it was a bunch of different ghost hunters and their experiences."
1,Don't waste your money....,"Firstly, let me say I love anything paranormal...I have found this subject to be fascinating to the extreme. I have first hand knowledge of several paranormal sightings and experiences. Have been most interested in tv shows like ""Most Haunted"" from the U.K. and Ghost Adventures from the USA.When I saw this collection, I jumped at the chance to see something a bit different, and the price was good too.It was the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to actually pay money for...sub-standard quality and dull specials."
2,Could have been better.,"I read through this book thinking that it was going to be a solid repair manual telling me what has to be done and showing me what the part I'm looking for actually looks like. Unfortunately this is not the case. If you're a mechanic certainly this book might be of some use but if you're looking for things like ""how do I change my spark plugs"" or something silly like that don't expect a detailed list of what parts you have to move to reach down into the tight area that you might need to get to. Most things are very general in this book so it's not recommended for people new to cars, get a Chilton's instead."
1,Index leaves a lot to be desired,"The index of the book is difficult to use, and the detail information is lacking. This could be a good book for the very basics, but if you're planning to do advanced work or anything requiring a great deal of troubleshooting, take a look around to find the factory manual or try Chilton's."
2,Get a Chilton instead,"this book is helpful , but is completely blown away by what the Chilton manuals cover. However its not a bad book to have."
3,Good Solid Book,"Good information for third gen owners. A lot of thought for the f body repair. Need more info for the 89 year, but helpful just the same."
3,Quiet and mesmerizing music,"I recently started to watch the Anime Series - Mushishi. ""Mushi"" means worm in Japanese. Actually, here the worm is more a legendary creature, a type of microorganism. Invisible to ordinary people. Only Mushishi can see them. In my opinion, ""Mushishi"" doesn't presents audience a great story. However the music catches my ears. The opening song - The Sore Feet Song (by Ally Kerr) is very ""Simon and Garfunkel"". You know, easy on human ears. The rest of the CD is pure music. The musician's name is Toshiro Masuda. You can see the musician made a lot of efforts when creating music for the Anime. Each episode has its own theme. It is very quiet music, which matches the style of the Anime. When watching Mushishi, it is like going into a world of Classical Chinese Paintings. Very relaxing. A tint of green always mesmerizes me when I watching Mushishi. The music has the same effect on me."
2,Pretty Pictures and little else,"The diagrams are the only reason I gave this book a two. There are some useful tables and figures that help clear up the gibberish that is the text. There is so much context that you cannot find the science. Also, when you can find the science it is occasionally wrong. Coulomb's law was listed and explained as depending on 1/distance between the charges not 1/(distance)^2. This is an egregious error. There are better books out there that you can learn from without having to question the validity of what you read."
1,Chemistry: The Science In Confusion,We used this book for a chemistry class in college and always ended up looking on the internet for further explanation of the concepts. This is not a good book for beginners! Also- there are SEVERAL errors as the book I had was a first edition- countless errors in fact. Makes doing homework stressful. Explanations are not well stated and example problems don't help when you get to the homework. The only benefit to this book over the new one they use for chemistry this semester is that this book pulls out vocabulary words and puts them in the margins of the text- that is the ONLY plus I see. Don't buy this book if you can avoid it!
2,Review,"Aside from typos and wrong answers, I have other issues with it. I doesn't explain concepts in a way that makes chemistry seem exciting; it attempts instead to couple chemical concepts with various human contexts (e.g., ""Properties of Gases -- and The Air That We Breathe""...it's like this for every chapter). There are no given pathways to external sources to learn more about a concept. All deep connections chemistry has to other subjects (and to the world in general) are lost.The only good thing about this book so far has been the fact that concepts and terms are clearly found in the page margins.Overall, this text book is pretty bad. (Also, the cover is ridiculous/stupid looking.)"
3,not as great as i would think,The textbook has a informal tone that I do not like. The index is not as helpful as I would have liked. Overall the book explains concepts well.
4,"Good Book, Great Price",The book was shipped really quick and in the condition it said online. Only thing is that on review it did not say that the binding was loose. But other then that I was pleased.
2,Way too expensive!!!,"I can get adult size gloves made of the same material, with a double layer which are much warmer for $1.50 at Target. Unfortunately it is very hard to find babies gloves with fingers and bought these in a pinch. They are thin and not very warm. They are ok for Florida winters which is what I bought them for, but would not recommend for colder climates."
1,Last ten minutes,"A waste of money. What a disappointment. The back zipper broke the second time my son used it, and it didn't inflate well from the beginning. I don't know how the photo was taken unless they had a different product from the one we received. Junk."
1,First they take your money...,"Ordering this item and getting it quickly was no problem even great. However, then things went south. Upon receiving the filter I realized that either they or I had ordered or sent the wrong filter. Upon reviewing the order I realized that I hadn't paid attention that the filter I ordered was only for a two cup machine while I had errantly thought I was ordering a 12 cup filter. Upon realizing the mistake I contacted the sellers to which I have never received a response. It cost me over $20 for this item and all I wanted to do was send them the two cup filter and have them send me the 12 cup filter. Seemed simple enough to me, but I didn't even get a response saying that they don't do exchanges or allow returns. Seems to me they took my money and ran..."
3,Associate professor,"Theoretically, the flow of explainations is Okay. The problem is that it contains too much material for one semester course(for an introductory couse), too much math and examples. It also lacks a CAD package such as matlab and simulink to support the book. The package becomes a must for a current textbook nowadays. More clear concepts rather than too much math examples and more practical application examples are hopeful."
3,"Math, Math, Math, Few Concepts","Overall this books is only okay. It emphasizes formulas and procedure way too much. Concepts are short, if concepts are explained at all. Basically, it lacks the necessary theory."
4,Not a bad book,"Using this book for my Signals and Systems class. Not a bad book, plus you can find the solution manual on the internet for free. =) The book skips a few steps in most examples - don't always show the step by step on how to derive each problem."
3,Mediocre Book with Bad Binding,"In the paperback version, this book is very likely to fall apart on you by the time you are finished with a semester. As far as content is concerned, it is a mediocre book with a lot of confusing wording. Some parts of the book make a lot of sense and others just go completely over your head. It often seems somewhat disorganized and poorly written."
4,Book or a hook?,"I have read the majority of this title, and I appreciate it for its brevity and simplistic approach to Astral travel and dreams. As a novice on such topics, but having had ""experiences"" with both, I am keeping an open mind to the possibilities that Belzebuub knows of what he speaks, as well as the point of reference needed to communicate effectively to an inexperienced audience. I find the writing style easy, and the contents relevant and effective. Coupled with the free online course, this companion book offers explanations, exercises, and questions and answers sections. I have enjoyed it thus far, and I will continue reading and practicing..."
1,A Course in Astral Travel and Dreams,"This is not a book to instruct you on how to achieve astral projection. It is a mish-mash of things about what you can expect if you are successful in astral projecting. I have yet to find a book that gives a simple procedure that will result in successful astral projection. I have done astral projection in the past but am having difficulty as of late. I must question whether the author is a successful astral projector or if he is simple writing from other works that he has read. I suspect there are a lot of fakes out there just trying to make a buck from gullibles such as I. If anyone has done a successful astral projection using this book, I would like to have them present their case as a review. Anyone that uses a crazy name like Belzebuub to hide his identity must be highly suspect."
1,...Be very careful with this author!,"Although the content of this book may seem harmless, this author actually has taken the information from another author and tried to make it ""his own"". That author is Samael Aun Weor.The problem with the writer of this Astral course is that he and his followers have and have tried over the years to take legal action against anyone who speaks against them! A quick web search and one can find all the shady dealings with Belzebuub ""aka Mark Pritchard"", his followers and their organization.Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"right size, bad colors","These earrings were the perfect size, unfortunately, the colors were so pale it was hard to tell one color from another. I returned them."
5,Nice pearls,I got this set of earrings about a year ago. They are all good quality and look very nice. I am very pleased!
1,Very dissapointing,I returned the pearl earings. They were of very poor quality. The colors were not pretty and the shapes were not even.
4,Real Pearls.,"As with all natural pearls, the shapes are not perfect. Only cultured pearls are perfect, because man controls them. The dye is uniform and the size is perfect, big enough that they can be seen easily. The colors; pink, white, gold, and lavender are clear. Even the green is a clear green, just not my favorite green."
3,"I really wanted to like them, but...","they just weren't as vibrant of colors as pictured. Maybe I got a bad set? The differences between the yellow, pink, and white were minimal. I kept them for a couple days to look at them and hope that maybe they'd grow on me, but they didn't. I'm submitting them for return, with the hope I'll find something here to take their place. On the other hand besides my disappointment with the color, they were good quality earrings."
3,not an earnest advertisment,"although the blender works quite well and cleans easily it is rated for 500 and not 800 watts as the ad claims. it is ample power, however i chose the unit because of the claim of 800 and was some what angred at its 500 watt rating."
4,good product,"Its a good blender. We bought it for preparing indian style mixes(dough/batter) and powders. it serves almost all our purposes. Main difference compared with mixers is that its blades are orinted straight upwards, where as in indian mixers you have two sets at two different horizantal levels. because of its blades orientation it doesnt crush the batter with out lot of water. You can use it as a mixer cum grinder but only disadvantage is you have to dilute the dough/batter a lot."
3,Not quite right,"It's a good machine, but unfortunately - it's kinda hard to deal with. It's too powerful for its settings it seems and it takes a really long time to crush ice.Not to mention - the Travel Cup is a pain in the butt to screw on with all the extra parts.Overall - it does the job for the price, and it is really powerful, but I've used much better blenders."
3,This 18 speed not as good as 12 or 14 speed for Indians,"This Product looks good but not good for making dosa or idli because i got 2 of them in 18 months both r gone smoking while grinding rice for dosa.1st one came around 8 months then again i bought the same one because i can use the jars and travel cup but this one also came around 10 months. This one is good for who don't cook indian food. I gave 3stars because this one not made for help indian cooking (indian dosa or idle or snacks). This works good crushing ice blending things.compare to this one i used 12 speed it came around more than 4 yrs grinding batter and all other things.18 speed one has a glass jar it is heavy to handle, 12 speed one has Styrene jar light weight and easy to handle.one more bad thing is u need to add more water when u r grinding, if u pour more water it leaks bottom of the jar."
5,Pass It On,"An accurate account of dating life from a woman's perspective. These types of things have happened to me too, but, I'm not nearly the storyteller that Ms. Ring is. A witty, charming, honest, entertaining and fun expose on dating. A ""How-To"" book for men - pass it on to your sons, brothers, male friends, nephews - save them from making the same mistakes."
2,Apply that clever wit towards fiction,"You have a very clever wit and a good sense of humor, but unfortunately, writing a self-help guide for single men doesn't really give you the opportunity to express either to their true potential. Perhaps that's why the chapters are all so short. I'd have to call it more of a dating ""pamphlet"" as opposed to a ""book"". The parts I enjoyed most though were your story telling abilities, but no sooner did you start a funny story, did the chapter abruptly end with a quick broad brush recap of the chapter's ""theme""."
4,"Oh One Star Reviewers, Where Are You Now...?","Interesting that there are no one star reviews after the economic downturn of 2008--present day. We see only what we want to see, t'would seem. Thus, when Bartlett and Steele's ""doomsday"" arguments bore fruit in 2008, we ought to note that they were on to something. I read this book when it was first published as a serial piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer, and then later in the book form. I've been citing their work for just as long.Can't wait to see Bartlett and Steele's latest work: What Went Wrong: The Betrayal of the American Dream. They're working with the Investigative Reporting Workshop of the American University School of Communications. Bartlett and Steele are true examples of what used to sell papers--smart, in-depth reporting that never flinched."
5,Should be required reading,When you're ready to go beyond the talking heads and sound bites this is a must read for anyone who cares about this country and what happens to it's people. If you believe that everyone really matters regardless of their wealth then you need to read this book and understand what has and is still happening in this country.
1,"Sensationalistic ""journalism"" at its worst.","One of the worst thought out books I ever read. Makes excessive use of case study, focussing on the story of a single individual, without attempting to dig into the more general experience of the population. It's section on the deregulation of the airlines was especially dishonest, as it examined one route where prices went up, without ever refuting or even discussing the broad evidence (that now should be apparent to everyone) that ticket prices fell with deregulation. This is classic doomster writing, and an excellent case in point for the position that economics should be left up to economists."
1,Typical Gloom and Doom by Economist Wannabees,"This is one of the silliest books I have read in a long time. Maybe worth buying if only to get a feel for some of the nonsense that people with connections are able to publish. What's wrong with America????? not much thank you!! Pulitzer prize winning authors just ""ain't"" what they used to be."
3,if only there had been a catalog number,"I needed a piece titled something along the lines of ""roumanian folk dances"" so i thought, oh yay here it is and by a really good editor, too!! well... i needed op 8a this is sz 53 (i think) i really wish in the title or in the description they had given the catalog numbers and i bought the wrong piece of music because of it. This would not have been a problem if Bartok didn't write like a bazillion ""romanian dances."" but, that's why one should always have that catalog number.however, i am keeping it because this is a good piece of literature and it's edited by a wonderful editor and it's only four bucks. amazon.com will not be the first place i go to, in the future, to buy scores from."
1,Who were the ad wizards that came up with this one?,"Okay, so what the hell? Goth is not Pink Floyd and Pink Floyd is SO not Goth. Even if this weren't the case, any cover of any Pink Floyd song would fail to do the song justice. And that's all I got to say about that."
1,Why?,"Ok, so, I haven't heard this. But I know all of the original songs very well, and I have heard some of these bands before, and all I can say is: WHY? Why would you put together a pink floyd cover cd made up of goth bands? Pink Floyd is in no way, shape, or form goth. At all. Not even a little. What's next, a Motzrt cover cd with Limp Bizkit and Korn?"
1,Oh dear,"A bunch of people, none of whom are terribly famous or very good at what they do, get together to knock off yet another Cleopatra Records ""tribute album"" to a multiplatinum group.Cleopatra Records, which has done more than its share already to molest the Pink Floyd legacy (their wretched ""best of Syd Barrett"" cd still reeks), tries to cash in once more by repackaging a previous release of Pink Floyd covers. The original, I believe, was a 2 disc set, which didn't sell. I suppose the reasoning was if they trimmed it down to a 1 disc collection, somebody who's a fan of one of these groups might buy it.Give yourself a break and pass on this sadness, and let these folks (and Cleopatra Records) lapse into the obscurity they deserve."
1,Just be thankful...,"Just be thankful you all didn't waste your money on the 2 cd set entitled A Saucerful of Pink... it has this cd (the one being reviewed here) and a 2nd disc of the same stuff... I agree for the most part that this compilation should have never been made, but, what do I know? I am just an Average Joe-Pink Floyd fanatic/musician/consumer..."
2,a collection of great dance songs perhaps?,"When I first heard about this cd, I thought it may be interesting. I liked Alien Sex Fiend's version of ""Echoes"" and Nik Turner's version of ""Careful With That Axe Eugene"". Maybe even The Electric Hellfire Club's rendition of ""Lucifer Sam"". The rest of this cd is lame. Din's version of ""On The Run"" doesn't even sound like anybody did a cover of it. It sounds like they just added the drum beat, kind of like the dance version of that Shania Twain song. Don't even bother with this cd unless you're already a fan of the bands on it. There's a better Pink Floyd tribute out there called The Moon Revisited with much better bands on it. Still, nothing is better than the real thing."
2,Save Your Money,For the same price you could get the new Tin Huey album and be much happier. They don't do tributes to Pink Floyd - they ARE Pink Floyd - re-incarnate.
2,There's a better deal out there,"This album is an abridgement of a 1995 album called ""A Saucerful of Pink,"" which I bought for less. Some of these tracks are interesting, some are just silly. They left out my favorite, Ron Geesin's original ""To Roger Waters, Wherever You Are."""
5,Excellent...captivating. maravilloso,"I love this cd. The selection of music that Jimmy's band brings is excellent, the sound quality, etc... is very nice. This is a cd that I could listen to over and over again nonstop, it is a cd where my love for latin music and the rest of my family's love for jazz mix, and we can share this cd!"
3,Core latin music but hardly danceable,"This album is really a very good sample of unadulterated salsa music, however it is hardly danceable.From the 12 tracks that it contains only the no 1 'La Cacharra' and no 11 'Sigo Cambiando' can be considered as almost decent dancing tracks, and those for the very hardcore salseros.The rest is just a good latin music album for collectors."
2,Celtic women Cd,An older CD. The girls voices are not as good--the songs not so great. Stick with the new cds
5,Beautiful Music,I have hundreds of CD's and believe me this is one of the most enjoyable CD's I have ever listened to in my life. Very relaxing.
4,"Rich, lush, etherial - but is it really ""new""?","I stumbled across Celtic Woman on PBS last night and was captivated by the lovely sound. I will buy the DVD. However, it all had a ""been there/done that"" vibe to it. The Enya selections sounded like Enya's arrangements, ""Theme From Harry's Game"" sounded like Clannad, and all the arrangements sounded like reprised Riverdance. Those aren't bad things, of course; the ladies and their voices/playing are lovely and the chorus and musicians are excellent. It just sounded to me like 5 new performers doing Enya, Maire Brennan/Clannad, Katie McMahon/Anuna, Eileen McMaster/Carol Lavelle, etc. They most certainly did it well. For me, ""There's A Place For Us"" (exquisite) and ""You Raise Me Up"" were more exciting."
3,Pleasant to listen to...,"..but not enough diversity in the songs for me. I kept waiting for a few of the songs to really strike my fancy but the ""same"" kept going on and on. I like Enya's version of their Sail Away better than this one and found the cd is great when one has problems falling asleep. Yes, their voices were ethereal but I need to be in a certain kind of mood for this kind of music which means I won't be listening to it that often. Still am glad I've added it to my celtic collection."
2,Bad Lip Sync,"As many others have commented the bad lip syncing just makes it seem so...well, fake. As another reviewer commented, it was empty and soulless to me. It's like they wanted to remove the possibility of making a singing mistake and concentrate all their efforts on looking beautiful. I want to see performers singing a song not pretending to sing a song."
1,Celtc Woman,CD never arrived! CD case entitled Celtic Woman arrived with a rap CD inside. I returned it to sender assuming a natural mistake and asking him/her to replace the correct CD....IT HAS NEVER COME! I paid for an item I never received nor have enjoyed. Please reply.Mrs. Gerry Gray-Lewis
3,Problems with Amazon.com,"The CD was fine, but I will not purchase anything more from Amazon.com until they stop selling materials promoting illegal animal fighting, blatantly peddling dogfighting videos as well as cockfighting magazines. These materials are not only offensive because of the cruelty they glorify, but their shipment is also a felony under the recently-enacted Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act."
1,This is garbage,"These songs are NOT performed by the original artists, know that first of all. As such, they sound cheap rip offs (because they are). If this is the kind of music you're after, you are MUCH better off to by it by the artist's themselves or off of other compilations."
1,In A Word...BORING!!!,"First I'd like to say that these womyn have lovely voices. That being said however, I have to say that this is one of the most boring, vapid, souless performances I have ever seen!It was almost like Celtic Muzak! And they even had the nerve to take one of the Divine Sarah's songs, Nella Fantasia, which she convinced the composer to allow her to turn into a song, and take all the passion and pathos that Sarah's voice brings to it and turn it into a real yawner!It was kind of like watching a group of lovely robots with perfect voices sing.The only song I even came close to liking is You Raise Me Up, which seems to be the only song that is sung with any feeling!"
2,way overrated.,I watched this and found it to be way overrated and you could tell it was all lip-synced.
1,what the......??,"like listen to singing robot, no matter how different, every song just like the others. singing like spring rewind clock tunes, so mechanic and so deadly mindless."
5,Celtic Woman,"Without a doubt, this was the best concert I have ever heard. The stage presence of the women was awesome. The quality of their voices was off the chart. The orchestration was fantastic."
5,Celtic Woman DVD,Excellent DVD of the 1st show by outstanding artists. Provides an interesting history of each artist and how they came together to become the premier Irish women group.
5,Ordered for my teenaged son,"My son (15) and I had originally watched this program on PBS. I had changed the channel from something completely mindless and thought my son would get disgusted and go to bed. However, he continued to watch and made several comments to me about how he ""liked"" Celtic Women. I thought he was being sarcastic, but soon realized he liked the songs, the presentation, and the nice looking Celtic Women. I surprised him for his birthday and got him the DVD. He wants the CD also. The music touched his musical side and he now wants to join choir. It is certainly a very good DVD, no inappropriate content, can be viewed by all family members. I would recommend this for anyone who is tired of seeing too much sex in music and really wants to get back to a beautiful concert and appreciation of good musicians. Jill"
4,Great songs for creativity,"As an insomniac, I was flipping through my television one night and caught the middle of the PBS special featuring these artists and songs. I was so swept up in the songs that I immediately got onto Amazon.com and ordered it for myself.I have been thrilled with the songs and often use the CD while I'm painting and drawing. I'm really fascinated with all things Celtic, so I have many CD's. But, this one is one of my favorites!"
5,The Voice of Heaven,"Celtic Woman features voices as pure as a cool, crisp breeze in spring. It is refreshing and invigorating music.I very much so delight in the DVD and corresponding CD."
5,A Bit of Heaven for Your Senses,"I think I originally bought this because of the cover girl's gorgeous curly red hair -- no not really! BUT the cover did catch my eye and then I listened to the snippets that Amazon offered to those who have a sound card. I bought it and have not been disappointed with it. The varied artists have the voices of angels! I listen to it often and confess to track 10 - 'SOMEDAY' probably being my favorite song, but they are all beautifully done - even if I don't understand the language on some. Gorgeous music - soothing and at times invigorating! -- I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this beautifully done set of perfectly performed Celtic music!"
5,Celtic Woman are great,I love the Celtic Woman CD the singers voices are fanastic. I listen to the CD in my car while I am driving to and from work. I liked it so much I have purchsed more CD's for relatives and friends to enjoy.
5,Celtic Woman DVD,Excellent! The music is perfect with full orchestra and the voices are crystal clear! The harmony is excellent between all the woman. I have watched the DVD several times and it is great for all ages to enjoy. Would make a perfect gift for anyone. I would hightly recommend this DVD. I also bought the CD for use in the car and at work.
3,Good Clean Pictures,"I think this one was the first video of celtic woman, and many good songs that sing beautifully."
4,music as beautiful as the women who sing it..,I purchased this for my husband who doens't miss Celtic Woman when they are on PBS. He was very pleased.
4,"Not as good as ""Live at Slane Castle""","A worthwhile addition to a Celtic music collection, but not on par with ""Live at Slane Castle"""
4,If Mama's happy.....,A real wife pleaser. She raved about it after seeing the show on TV. I got it for her. I'm a hero.
5,Beautiful!,"I watched part of the Celtic Woman show on tv and thought it was fantastic! The 4 women have amazing voices, and the 5th, who plays the violin, is incredible! It made me get goosepumbs; I was unable to speak (especially on the song Nella Fantasia - that woman has the most beautiful voice in the world!)On tv, the cd (or tape) is being sold at 75$. On amazon, it's at 13.99$. I'm going to buy the first AND second cd here and pay much less than I almost did for just one!!Every single song on this cd is beautiful! It is worth every penny, and it's a great deal! I love it!"
4,Celtic Woman is a great video,"This video is for those lovers of Celtic music and beautiful, talented women. It is entertaining and conforms to the Celtic tradition."
5,Lovely,"I absolutely love this collection of songs. They are lovely and soothing. I wouldn't quite call them ""Celtic"", but they are wonderful nonetheless. Their singing voices are all beautiful. I play this whenever I need a calming atmosphere."
5,Fantastic Music,"Having been teased by this performance on PBS, I found the DVD delivers all that it promises. Great music performed with stirring passion and nuance. The arrangements for the orchestra and supporting choir behind the soloists is remarkably entrancing."
5,Celtic Woman,"I watched them on the PBS station when they were having a fund raiser. My daughter and I absolutely loved this concert, but could not financially afford to purchase it then. We were told that it could only be purchased from them. Then we found it on Amazon.com. Had to have it. The women's voices are absolutely beautiful and breathtakingly clear and the music is an added bonus. If you enjoy Celtic music, I strongly encourage you to purchase this CD. I listen to it a lot through the week and my daughter who is almost 8 yrs goes around singing the songs all the time."
4,Fine Musical Celebration Of Irish Celtic Music New and Old,"My cynical side will say that this is just a blatant artistic attempt to follow in the wake of ""Riverdance"", Enya and Frank McCourt's superb writing, to say nothing about other superb Celtic music groups such as The Chieftains and Altan. However, I caught this DVD when it aired as part of the annual summer pledge drive on my local PBS station and I was instantly hooked. Instead of making comparisons to ""Riverdance"", both critics and listeners should regard this concert as a fine musical performance by some talented young Irish women who are superb singers and musicians; or to put it more simply, they are as talented as the young British singer Charlotte Church. I'm not sure whether I'll have a chance to hear them when they perform this spring at New York City's Carnegie Hall, but I have no doubt that their live performance here will be a resounding success."
5,If angel sang.....,"I'm not one for purchasing female vocals, but I heard these angels sing by chance and knew I had to own it to repeat the pleasure again and again. They are as pure as chimes, bells, a harp song...you get the picture...pure and smooth. A joy to listen to and affordable."
5,Celtic Women is my new favorite CD!!!,"This album is unbelievable. I ordered it because I had seen the special on PBS and loved a few of the songs they sang. Now every single song has become my favorite. My roommate and I fall asleep to it every night. If you love good music and soothing voices, this is DEFINITELY worth the money."
5,Simply Amazing,"As seen on PBS with a few additional songs and interviews with each of the girls and David Downes, their talented musical director. I ordered this DVD after I'd seen the group's second PBS special and I have to say, this one is actually better. Pop it in the DVD player as background entertainment while you're having a get-together and you will get plenty of compliments!"
4,Celtic Woman review,"This is a beautiful recording. I only wish there were more duet or group pieces - while the individual voices are lovely, there is sometimes some fullness missing. Chloe's voice is sweet, but lacks the depth of some of the others."
5,Celtic Woman DVD,David Downes is a genius at arranging. The songs have a modern feel to old Irish classics. The ladies all have voices of angels and David made sure they were featured on their best songs. Superb concert and great camera work to capture this wonderful Irish experience on DVD.
5,Beautiful Irish singing,"If you like the soothing sound of Irish music, this concert is definitely for you. If you want pop music or something more upbeat, then look somewhere else. Celtic woman is a talented group of Irish singers who sing a selection of pop, new age and traditional Irish songs in this concert. They are classically trained, immensely talented and sing beautifully. My two favorite songs are Send me a song and Nella Fantasia."
5,Wonderful Women,"These are wonderful women to listen to. Their voices are strong and beautiful, and they sound best when they are all put together."
3,Celtic,"This is not as good as the Celtic Woman Christmas DVD, but it is a nice one. It was interesting to see and hear the interviews with the performers. These ladies really do have beautiful voices."
5,Loved it,Great ladies group ever. Love there music. They are awesome and there music is like listening to angels sing. Will buy every album they put out.
5,Breath taking,this cd is wonderful. beautiful music and it makes it easy to see why these girls keep making great music.
4,CD Celtic Woman,"Fast service, good price with good packaging and tracking of delivery.-Carroll Satterfield"
3,Good Start for Celtic Novices,"Some of the songs on this album are original. Some are canned goods reopened again and again. Do we really need another Ave Maria? Chloe's rendition of this classic was flat, toneless, and lacking in any emotion. Her refusal (or inability) to add some color and vibrato to her impressively clear voice becomes annoying, as she could be singing these pieces so much better. She needs a little more training before I can listen to her singing without cringing. The next Charlotte Church she is not.The other vocalists, however, offer great performances, but I wish they would have picked some more Gaelic/Welsh material. Meav has an amazing crystal clear soprano and sings her pieces with ease. She and Orla have very pleasant voices. Mairead plays a mean violin. I recommend this album to anyone interested in expanding their horizons and needing some music to relax to. (I certainly enjoy singing along to it!)"
2,very happy with how quickly it was delivered,"the album was a huge letdown, i will not purchase any more albums from this group."
5,CELTIC WOMAN SHARON,"TRULY WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL TALENT, AS IN ALL THE WOMEN CELTIC MUSIC, IT IS HARD TO FAULT. ANGELISTIC VOICES, BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, MAGNIFICENT!!!"
1,Not a good representation of Celtic music.,"If you're looking for ambient music, buy this. It is not Celtic music, at all."
2,Where is the a capella Somewhere?,"I was listening to a pledge drive-rendition of this show in the background while working on the computer, and was all of a sudden rivted by the four-part a capella harmony on Bernstein's ""Somewhere"". Wow! Concert? I will go! I went to buy the recording, but that number is not present. Huh?? I listened to the rest of the show, and I would say 75% of it is powerless elevator music. Sigh. I would spend much money to go listen for hours to these women sing spot-on harmony like that on Somewhere, despite the lack of open throat. There was so much could have done here. I just don't understand it. Who picked this music? Who picked what was to be included on the CD?"
5,Stays with you,"Days after listening to this CD I can hear their voices in my mind. They have a rare gift for song. Not just the simple emoting of words but that rare conjunction of harmony and spirit.Each could stand alone as a master of her craft, but together they synergize into something more. A fusion of styles centered around the Celtic tradition. Though the word ""Celtic"" fails to do their genre justice because they expand far beyond that boundary.While those looking for traditional Celtic music may not find what they are looking for here, anyone who enjoys classically performed music should find something to love.And if you have an eclectic love of many styles then at least try out the samples. There is a good chance they have something to offer you.All I truly know is that I love listening to the music, and I love the way their voices stay with me. I hope you enjoy this music as much as I do."
5,Celtic Woman,"This Music is incredible! The voices are pure, the music wonderful. I saw the program on public TV and had to have the album. I am not sorry I ordered it, and will definitely watch for additional titles."
5,Celtic Woman in 2010-2011,"WOW is the first word that comes to mind when you hear the very first note from the ladies of Celtic Woman. I am so fortunate that more than 10 years ago, I was turned on to Enya and branched out from there in Celtic music. A few years ago I had the privledge of finding Celtic Woman. While the members have changed some, the outstanding voices have remained and outstanding is an understatement. These ladies simply have some of the best harmony and voices in music today. In 2011, Celtic Woman will be touring the USA and I plan to go to one of the shows as you have no idea how good they are until you see them up close and personal. The siren's simply can sing.Buy the CD's, Watch them on PBS but do Not miss Celtic Woman. They simply are remarkable singers whose talent one should not miss."
3,Re: Audio dubbed on Celtic Woman DVD,"I am responding to D. Henderson. You are partially correct. Actually, this is common in many if not most ""live"" DVD concerts, that they have dubbed over sound and/or video. If they have the budget, this may encompass many performances over several dates. However, this was billed at one location. In that case, they may have done a song two or more times to get the shots they want. As for the audio, they will take the best performance of a song, and ""sweeten"" it, by doing in-studio overdubs or cutting in from the alternate live takes. The editor is then responsible for adjusting the lip sync to within an acceptable range. Some editors are better at this than others, and sometimes its the monitoring that can affect the outcome. In reality, it is rare that a performance is transfered to final video output ""as is"", regardless of the performer."
4,Awesome Talented Singers,"Absolutely wonderful voices raised in song, but not quite as bright and lively as their other DVDs."
5,"Most incredible, memorable concert!","I initially saw this on our local PBS broadcast and was totally captivated even though this is not my usual genre of music. The DVD was very well put together--the best concert DVD that I've seen that was so well done both musically as well as visually. As for the CD it has the same songs in a difference order, and I must have listened to this CD a 100 times before I could put it down and listen to other artists. It's a must have for your collection!"
5,Cetic Woman the Best of the Best.,THIS IS A REAL EXALLENT SHOW TO WATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. I HAVE WATCHED IT AT LEST TWICE. THIS IS A REAL GOOD BUY FOR CETIC WOMAN.
4,Melodic and haunting,"Found these gals on public t.v. They are just wonderful. In a time when you can't make out most vocals of current pop music, you'll enjoy being able to understand and appreciate these lovely songs and very gifted singers."
5,CLASSICAL REVIEW,"WOLNDERFUL CONDUCTOR, TALENTED PERFORMERS, AUTHENTIC INSTRUMENTSEXCEPTIONAL IN ALL WAYS."
5,Heavenly!!!,I've watched this 5 times in the past month by sharing it with everybody. Even my country/western fan son loved it.
3,Celtic Woman,"Good music, but didn't like as many songs as was on Public Television program. Maybe I'll try the DVD next. Celtic music is a favorite of mine."
3,Better without the visuals,"I saw this on PBS and was unfortunately struck by the ""theatrical"" performances of the women. Particularly annoying was the blond fiddler, who seemed to strut, overact with her body, and look directly into the camera saying ""Yes, I'm beautiful, and I know you want me, so by this DVD"". Cloying is the word I'd use.Some of the other performers seemed slightly smug, or overly coached on how to emote their songs. Probably the best of the lot was the blond singer who sang ""She moved through the Fair"".I just listened to the cd online, and, had I only heard it, without the ""performances"", I'd likely have bought it.But now, I don't care to join the rush to the new celtic Spice Girls ensemble. The performance I saw felt totally contrived, packaged, and marketed."
4,"Tasty, like soup!","You know, I don't think there's a single woman alive who's dead. Knowing this as well as they (obviously) do, Celtic Woman has created a musical masterpiece that doesn't sound ANYTHING like dead women.By singing into microphones that sound as though they were plugged in at the time, the Celtic Women were really able to capture their unique sound. Their singing ability is surpassed only by their ability to surpass singing ability.This is highly, lowly recommended!"
1,I was a Celtic woman.,"I was a Celtic Woman until July 2002. Unfortunately, I had to move upstate to Albany and they gave me the boot. My name is Sheena McDoogie, and be sure to look for my new record coming out in 2006 tenatively titled ""Burning Bush - South of the Border."""
5,Saw it on PBS,"Saw this special on PBS, loved the performers, costumes, musicians and most important the music. Bought the dvd and the cd , happy with both."
3,Good CD but,Some of the women singing on this album do not seem to have quite the vocal range needed for the songs. A good but not great listen.
1,Lip-Synching Galore,"After watching this DVD several times, I am disgusted at how pre-recorded this concert really was. These women don't even sing on this DVD, they lip synch more than any other artist that I've seen. Even Britney Spears attempts at least ONE live song, as horrible as it may sound.These women take the marketable Celtic concept and deliver a DVD that rips off customers. Yes, the music is beautiful and ethereal; no dispute there. But if you're going to put on a concert, sing the songs live to your audience. I hope these women can really sing in the first place and were just suffering from acid reflux.I give this DVD one star because of the money I paid for being ripped off with lip-synched vocals and pre-recorded performances. These ""Celtic"" women should be ashamed of themselves. Absolutely ridiculous. I saw something similar to this on Saturday Night Live a few months ago with Ashley Simpson."
5,Features the Incredible Fiddler Mairead Nesbitt,"This is a wonderful CD containing a variety of traditional Irish, classical and contemporary music. The majority contains vocals by some of the most talented soloists Ireland has to offer, but some of the tracks are fantastic instrumental numbers by the groups violinist, Mairead Nesbitt. She will delight you with her traditional sound and her mastery of the instrument."
5,Features the Incredible Irish Fiddler Mairead Nesbitt,"Mairead Nesbitt has been featured in Lord of the Dance, Feet of Flames, Dance Invasion, and other fabulous Irish shows. But this DVD contains some of her best work. You will be absolutely enchanted as she prances around the stage like a pixie all while fiddling and never missing a note. She is accompanied by some very talented soloists with angelic voices. This DVD offers something for everyone."
5,Celtic Woman,"I thought that I was getting a cd when the dvd was ordered. That was a wonderful mistake! My wife and I watched it the next Saturday night, since we can't afford the tickets for the real concert. We recommend this video highly! Even if this is ordered by mistake, the experience is worth it! The Irish have a really wonderful group of talented women and the world is lucky to be able to enjoy their music.Celtic Woman"
5,Angelic Voices & Heavenly Music,"I caught the performance on my local PBS station and was absolutely blown away. I just had to buy the DVD. Chloe, Lisa, Meav and Orla have some of the beautiful voices I have ever heard. Combining this with Mairead's musical gift brought the entire thing together for a phenomenal performance. From the start you are mesmerized by the sounds of angelic voices and beautiful music; you just wished it would go on and on."
5,Celtic Woman,"I researched all of the singers, names pictures and Blog. I also purchased the Celtic Woman: Live at Slane Castle DVD. This I have waited since 12/16/2006."
4,I bought it for my wife for Christmas,It's constantly played in her car and in the house for our newborn child.
5,Ireland shared the voices of angels with the world.,"The women of Celtic Woman are fabulous. Their voices brought me to tears, especially Lisa Kelly. And, David Downes is brilliant."
3,Beauty vs. Beast,"The leads' voices are indeed angelic and incomparable, solo and united. The music selection is also quite worthy of this title. But the general audio mix leaves a lot to be desired. At best, it is unwieldy, with the orchestra and back-up choir frequently overpowering and smothering the lead(s). Visually, the mix is similar. The cameras seem to spend much more time on the support element (orch and choir) than the leads, with harsh fades between the two. The strength and high quality of the lead voices is what brings this production out of the basement."
2,not traditional celtic music,"I haven't listened to the entire CD, but I felt I had to comment. While many of the songs are traditional celtic songs, the arrangements, the production and vocal stylings sound closer to a Disney movie than traditional celtic music. I hate to be such a snob, but this music is so watered down, that I feel the spirit of celtic music has been lost here."
3,Celtic Woman DVD - Blinding,"I purchased the CD and DVD of this concert. The music is wonderful and varied enough to listen all the way through at one sitting. The DVD has some extra music, but is hard to watch, since the staging of the show was inappropriately done like a rock concert, with rotating spotlights that randomly and continually flash into the camera lens and thus into your eyes. This music and the singers deserve better than this."
2,"Celtic Woman - ""OK""","I heard the advertisement for this CD on a local christian radio station. The few snippets they played caught my interest. However, once I bought the CD and listened to it twice, I had enough of it."
1,Mediocrity sells,"In addition to what others have said about the lip-sync'ed, faked performances totally devoid of soul, the fiddler was not exactly ""there"" either. You can tell when the cameras zoom into where the bow is sliding in the wrong directions along the strings. If the microphone had been turned on, it would have picked up nothing but screeches. It seemed that her role there was to provide flashy displays of flailing hair.I like Enya's music and performance. I might have liked ""Celtic Woman"" a little better had I not seen this ""concert"", but just heard it. But then, what I would hear are diluted versions of the real thing."
1,"""Live"" concerts are lyp-synced with this group","Just a warning to anyone wanting to see this group live - I saw them in concert last year with a friend at the Greek Theatre and my pleasure at the singing and fiddle-playing quickly turned to disappointment at the obviously lyp-synced vocals and dubbed fiddle. Their CDs are probably wonderful, but their live performances are apparently not live at all."
2,Vegas on the River Shannon,"I bought the DVD. Individually, they are very good, perhaps even great. But the concert didn't work. Visually it was awful. Too flashy. Think of Danny Boy. A song invoking fraternal love between rural lads and fear of parting by violent death, sung by women in glitzy dresses on a Vegas-style stage? Come on! When they sing, they don't seem to know what to do with themselves so they kind of wobble around. The cameraman-ship was 2nd rate. Audience pan shots reveal a lot of folks sitting on their hands. Closeups get too close. The blond fiddler played great but the very regular swooshing of her long hair seemed too affected, especially when playing slow pieces. Ugh."
1,Elevator music,"This is ""Easy Listening"" music, the kind of stuff they play in an elevator. I say skip it because you can do better.You would be better off listening to all the Enya they are ripping off. She does it better anyway. These ""Celtic Women"" are about as Celtic as Brittany Spears.Heck they sing ""Danny Boy"" for goodness sake. Only people pretending to be Irish sing ""Danny Boy."" You want to listen to what Irish people like? Try Flogging Molly. Try The Saw Doctors. Heck try U2."
1,Vapid and saccharine,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who point out (rightly) that this is not Celtic music, and that the performances are weak and uninspired. The PBS show was mildly entertaining for a few minutes, but it became obvious quickly that these interpretations of traditional music are more ""lite commercial pop"" than anything else. The derivation from Flatley's shows was obvious. Also I agree that PBS has so diluted its offerings in fine arts with this, Andre Rieu, Andrea Bocelli, Charlotte Church, and other ""pseudo-classical"" performances that it is deeply disappointing.Instead of this drivel, go for music with real substance, including really traditional Celtic music (without the soft haze of easy listenin') and the enormous treasure of art music (renaissance, baroque, classical, etc.) which reward repeated listening with new discoveries. Other reviewers have made fine suggestions."
1,Very dull and cheesy,"As a big fan of Enya, Lorenna McKennitt and other celts, I was very dissappointed with this CD. These women's voice have no depth or character, they sound like 12 year-old boys. Doing covers without adding anything new or intersting is a waste of money. Especially the cheesy remake of Orinoco Flow. I was very let down."
2,VERY POOR,SONGS WERE TO FOLK LIKE THERE WAS NOTHING NEW OR EXCITING THERE ARE FAR BETTER ALBUMS DONE BY THE CELTIC WOMEN THIS WS THE POOREST SO FAR.Celtic WomanCeltic Woman
5,Just another wonderful Celtic Woman in the same tradition,"Altho I gave 5 stars, because I love all Celtic Woman, some are better than others. Check the minutes, especially on CDs.Also, the sound is better on everything done since 2000 or so. The best video is the one made at the beautiful castle. They showed the construction and preparation as a side extra."
5,"Angelic, Heavenly, Breathtaking!","The beauty of this music and the angelic voices never fail to bring a surge of emotion that wells up inside of me, almost to the point of tears. This is as pure as music can be, as perfect as human voices can be, embodied by these four heavenly artists. My words only hint at how this music has affected me. Breathtaking!"
4,an ethereal pleasure,"Although I have seen the ""Celtic Woman"" cd in the store, I did not listen to it thinking it another derivative celtic music collection. However, I caught part of the PBS broadcast of this show and was totally mesmerized. The new spin on such classics as Ave Maria and contemporary classics like Ennio Morricone's Nella Fantasia, Enya's Orinoco Flow and Josh Groban's You Raise Me Up brought me to norvana. The soprano's(Chloe, Meav, Lisa Kelly) voices are crystal clear and Orla's harpistry is divine. Mairead's fiddle playing brings this cd back to earth with its foot stomping earthy, cetic and vibrant flavor. My only regret is that they did not include the stunningly beautiful Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring that was featured in the PBS special."
5,More yeas than nays - Yea!,"I watched this on PBS three times. I ordered it from Amazon immediately. If it was patched, so what. The final take is captivating! Everyone in my family gets it for Christmas.I did tell the family to be sure to watch with a good sound and video system. I have excellent sound and graphics systems with my pc.And watching in full screen letterbox really increases the enjoyment. The quality of sound and color graphics with better equipment is astounding.I do aggree that subtitles of the lyrics would be nice (or maybe publish the lyrics with the DVD). I agree that the flashing spots were distracting and more close ups of the musicians and chorus would improve the presentations.However, those of you who were distracted by the lighting, synching, etc., just listen.... Don't watch. Just to listen is enchanting."
2,Celtic Lite,"Put me in the ""unimpressed"" camp of listeners to this album. As a fan of REAL Celtic music (Chieftains, Altan, et al.) I too find this an amazingly bland performance. The vocals are uneven - Lisa Kelly's voice, for instance, is pleasant and warm enough, but Chloe Agnew, who seems to be touted on this CD as a headliner, is no Charlotte Church - her teenage voice is thin and tentative. The orchestral arrangements are at times sappy and overblown, sounding like ""Riverdance Lite"". Some of the instrumental work is competent, like Orla Fallon's harp and Mairead Nesbitt's fiddle, but it's not like I haven't heard better elsewhere. My overall impression is this was an assemblage of pretty faces whose primary purpose seems to be to create another popular PBS pledge-drive special. Pardon me if I offended anyone - if this happens to be your cup of Irish tea, please indulge. As for me, I'm going to put on an Altan CD."
5,ADDICTED,"I WAS IN BED WATCHING FLIPPING CHANNELS AND CAUGHT THIS ON PBS. I COULD NOT CHANGE THE CHANNEL. I JUMPED OUT OF BED AND PUT IT ON THE BIG TV IN THE L.R. AND TAPED IT. WE WATCH IT AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. THESE GIRLS HAVE BEAUTIFUL VOICES AND HIS BEST FRIEND FEELS JUST LIKE US. I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN MY HUSBAND SAID HE SAW AN AD ON TV WHERE WE COULD PURCHASE IT CHEAPER THAN ON PBS, I KNOW THEY NEED DONATIONS BUT IT WAS RIGHT AT CHRISTMAS AND I DID NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO SPARE. I WILL BE SO GLAD TO GET THIS AND BE ABLE TO PLAY IT IN MY CAR. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE FROM THESE 5 GIRLS. IT IS LIKE LISTENING TO ANGELS SING, AND FOR (MY HUSBAND THE ROCK AND ROLLER TYPE) TO BE EXCITED LIKE I AM SAYS A LOT FOR THEM. HE LOVES LISTENING TO THEM AS MUCH AS I DO. ANYBODY THINKING ABOUT ORDERING THIS YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
5,Celtic Woman,"I recently saw the show on PBS, and was simply blown away. The cd is absolutely amazing, and unlike other groups such as the Three Tenors, Celtic Woman blends all the voices beautifully. Their different renditions of both the Irish songs, and the modern songs were well done to say the least. The sound of Celtic Woman is where tradition meets the modern world in beautiful harmony."
5,AMAZING PERFORMANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is without a doubt one of the best performaces I have ever seen. The music, the stage, the ladies were absolutely beautiful, everything was simply top notch! The singing was out of this world! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD!!!!!!!!"
5,Celtic Woman,"This is beautiful music that is relaxing, soothing, and refreshing. The young women are excellent vocalists and present a concert that is from the heart. The orchestra and other singers are supurb. This is the best CD I have purchased in a long time. Hope they do another one soon!"
5,"For this price, think of it as a CD with moving pictures.","I saw this on PBS last night. Lip synching or not, it's beautiful to watch and great ""chill out"" music to listen to.I plan to listen to it more than watch it. I've got my DVD player sound running through a quality 1970's era stereo system, and the picture through a little 15 flat panel tv, so I'll just treat this as a beautiful music CD that I can also watch if I want to. The price is right."
4,Celtic woman,Awesome music and well done on the recording. Something I will enjoy for years. I love to expose my kids to different types of music and this is a great one for any music library.
3,Good visuals but problems in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound,"Agree with ""Go Bears"". Video quality is very good but I am having problems with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. I can clearly hear a very short distorted sound on the middle of the second song ""Walking In The Air"" (and other songs too). I do not have any problem when I switch audio option to regular stereo sound.I don't have a home theater system. All I have is a Sony Wega TV and a cheap Apex DVD player. Maybe ""Balanced Reviewer"" is correct on the equipment part of his/her review. However, I don't have any problem with other music DVDs (such as Hayley Westenra's Live From New Zealand).Still, my wife and I are very happy with this DVD. Who needs Dolby Digital 5.1 anyway?"
1,Tink Mats,"Does not hold any dirt. Mats are smooth and flat so the dirt simply slides right off onto your carpet! Cute mats, wish they were made like the others with raised areas and soft rubber."
2,crazy heroine,"The heroine of the book seemed to react to everything with illogical melodrama, more like a five year old than a grown woman. She decides that her cousin's husband is a murderer with no evidence - just the fact that he married for money (something the bride knew in advance). The hero, who obviously is a decent sort, treats his brilliant, blind son with common sense and devotion, but nothing changes the heroine's opinion until nearly the end of the book. What the hero sees in her is beyond me."
5,"Rediscovering America: The Salem Witch Trials, Hosted by David Hartman","This was the first documentary on the Salem Witch Trials I ever saw. It started a continuous journey of research on the subject that continues to this day. While this might not be the best documentary by way of accuracy ( This came out in 1997 and other documentaries have been done on this topic since then) its a great introduction to what happened in Salem in 1692. The program itself is interesting, wonderfully filmed in a way that gets the viewers attention, and it never gets graphic. ( The show does include an execution scene which is mostly done in shadow so not much is really shown).I'd recommend this to middle school teachers, even college professors of American History. Id also recommend the History Channels documentary entitled "" witch hunt"" Both make excellent teaching materials."
2,"Lionhart, please","This lionhart, is a blowhard.His arms are too small for pads, he looks like HHH, and he bends wierd."
3,A decent read for Spider-Man fans...,"This is a decent read for Spider-Man fans. All the stories are varied and use a good variety of villians. None of them are anything to write home about, but are good filler on a boring day. At least the book is enjoyable."
3,Great At First,"I've had a set for three years; two with heavy use on a gas range, and one year in storage. Not sure when it happened, but both plates are warped. I also have a set of the less expensive Nordicware, and while they're not as efficient (especially on a low flame), they're in better shape after equally heavy use."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"Horrible writing, really bad acting, and a very poor look to it. Obviosly, a very low budget for an ambitious, but not very interesting plot. I would not have even given it one star but the Amazon system does not offer that option."
2,watch HBO or Cinemax,If you like this type of movie (and I do)you'll get more excitement from a T&A late show on cable. Rent it and see if you agree.
