1,"Come on,this group can't sing","In my opnion,this group is terrible.They can't sing.When they sing on tv,it sounds like lipsynching.Don't waste your money.Buy LeAnn Rimes' new cd,it is worth the money"
3,Is this a live CD ?,"First of all I love the Dixie Chicks and saw them live in Dublin and they were great. However I was very disapppoined with this live CD, it could have been recorded in any studio. There was only one occasion on the whole Cd where they interacted with the audience. Audience participation and interaction with the performers add the enjoyment of a live album, sadly this was very much lacking on this CD. If you are a Dixie fan and want to buy this CD for it's 'live' value don't bother stick to any of their other CD's."
2,"Close your eyes and listen, too distracting to watch.","The ""concert"" is a compilation of numerous concerts and edited into one. The constant hairstyle and clothing changes from the respective concerts are more disruptive than anything. It takes away from the music because you are constantly distracted by the editing. It's done in a ""music video"" style and NOT as you would expect to see from a concert. It makes you wonder about the audio tracking. The audio track is seemless, too seemless as this is a compilation of numerous concerts. ""Is it real or Memorex?"" Save your money on this one and buy the ""Evening With The Dixie Chicks"". That's a concert and basically the same material."
3,Visuallydisappointed,"Although I don't get into the Political aspects of any Musician or Actor, I truly like the Chicks music, and the talent level is so far above so may ""young"" acts out there now, that the musicanship will take your breathe away.My problem (I guess being an old fuddy duddy) is the editing of the DVD. Is it the ""IN"" thing to do to show every Camera Cut away to show the Chicks at a Different Venue? Seeing Natalie sing one song wearing 15 different outfits and wearing her hair who knows how, is one of the most distracting things I have ever seen. It is obvious that the vocal track is from one venue, so seeing the editors trying to match the playing and lips in sync with the track is beyond annoying. Maybe it would have been better to do each song from a different venue. Seeing all the different outfits the Girls wear during one song is unbelievably distracting.Am I just showing My age, or do people really like this??"
5,Can't get better than this,"WOW! Talk about talent. This CD is incredible. This is by far the best live CD I have ever purchased. I can't believe that this was not remastered in the studio. Natalie's voice is incredible. I also can't believe that they have this many songs on one CD, for such a low price. Great CD, Great Price!"
5,Love this Cd...,"Great value, great service! Regardless of the political controversy, I miss the Dixie Chicks. It's time to forgive and forget...."
5,Superb Quality,"The sound quality on this CD is superb. It brings out the best in the Chicks wonderful harmonies and instrumentation. The live versions of these songs incredible. There is a new song included on this CD entitled Mississippi, which is one of my personal favorites on the CD. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Jada Greenway-online disc jockey-acoustic paradise radio,"Travelin' Soldier is my favorite song by the Dixie Chicks--it reminds me of another song I heard before I ever heard Travelin' Soldier called ""Soldier And The Fortune Teller"" by the artist ""Rhiannon""---Like 'Soldier And The Fortune Teller'....'Travelin' Soldier' is a wonderful bluegrass song with beautiful imagery, outstanding instrumentation...and out of this world vocals...this is by far their best work ! hear it -love it-buy it !!!"
2,Talented but can't listen any longer!,"How could anyone say the Dixie Chicks have no talent? They clearly have a unique sound in country music. My problem is I can't listen to them any longer without cringing. Natalie Maines comments regarding our Commander in Chief just keep ringing thru my ears. She said she feels ""vindicated"" on her opposition of going to war in Iraq. On a day like today, when that tyrant who murdered hundreds of thousands of people is captured, her lack of compassion for the Iraqi People makes me sick. So......there are good songs on this cd, but it is not selling real well, is it! I just can't listen any longer. Get the new Johnny Cash or Toby Keith cd, they're great!"
1,CHICKS Are Not Country,"By there own admission the Chicks turned their back on country music (Joining Leanne Rimes, Faith Hill, SheDaisy, Shania Twain and Deanna Carter in that failed endevour). Wide Open Spaces was a great CD, but their music and politics have went down ever since. They all copy Shelby Lynne and the ALT country movement, or think they are Brittney Spears. If you want country please try Sherrie Austin, Gretchen Wilson, or male singers such as George Strait, Toby Keith, or Alan Jackson. I would not put one red cent in the Chicks purses."
2,Worst Girl Group Ever,Girl groups better than The Dixie Chicks:1. TLC2. EnVogue3. The Supremes4. Xscape5. SWV6. The Bangles7. The Pointer Sisters8. Sister Sledge9. Destiny's Child10. The Go-Gos11. Blaque12. Kut Klose13. The Pussycat Dolls14. The Spice Girls15. Dream16. 3LW17. Heart18. Changing Faces19. Eden's Crush20. Salt N Pepa21. Vanity 622. Apollonia 623. Brownstone24. Total25. 70226. The Donnas27. Allure28. Martha and The Vandellas29. Cleopatra30. Divine31. Jade32. The Mary Jane Girls33. Bananarama34. The Judds35. Any imaginary girl group I think up.
4,"Chill-inducing, foot stomping, hand clapping at its best!","I, like some of the other folks who have reviewed the Chicks, have never been a country fan. I snobbishly chided my father when he started getting in to Garth Brooks, Dolly Parton....and the Dixie Chicks. Once I got past my own prejudices about country, though, and listened to the Chicks' music, I was hopelessly hooked.Maines' crisp, electrifying voice and virtuoso ornamentation give me chills every time I listen. The Chicks' lilting harmonies and old-timey instrumentation make for just the right combination of beauty and block party. Every song on this recording is a gem - I'm so glad I found them!"
5,The Music DOES speak for itself!!,"This new disc from the Chicks is great from start to finish. If you didn't get to catch them on their Top Of The World tour (as I didn't) then this CD is a must, if you DID catch them, you'll want this disc. If you're one of those fairweather fans you turned your back with all the controversy, maybe you should give them another shot. This album has all the stuff you'd want and it's a fun listen. You will want to pick up the companion DVD as well, it's a few songs shorter, but you get to see the Chicks in action (very well shot by the way) and you get to see their very cool new video for ""Top Of The World"". Just a great recording!!!"
4,a welcome addition,"Great to have a fistful of Dixie Chicks tracks. Would have been great if it had included their apology for ""w""statement, but then again it's just as well to just have their incredible presentations."
5,none better,"Mr. Oliveira is one of our greatest violinists. I now own three copies of this (1 in storage, 1 given to a friend and 1 in rotation). A brilliant performance all around and lovely recording."
2,Luftwaffe Light,"The first third of the book is not about the Luftwaffe at all, but rather the Nazis' rise to power. It is almost too easily-digestible, but if one needs a fast-reading primer (as opposed to wading through ""rise-and-fall-of-the-third-reich"" type books), it could serve. It is a non-biography in the sense that you're looking at Goering from 3 miles away instead of 1 foot away -- i.e., you don't really come to know the man intimately. The Luftwaffe portion of the book is no more than a backgrounder, but could be useful if that's all you need."
5,Junie B. Jones Gets Smashed,"I really like it. It was funny when Christopher Columbus swan to America. I thought the story was funny. My favorite part was the real play when Junie B. got all smashed up with May, Sheldon and everything. Junie B. is the best girl and the funniest girl."
5,Sharon - former educator,"I purchased the first Junie B book to read over the phone to my granddaughter. I chuckled reading them, sent them on and her mother laughed like crazy reading them to her. Now, this book is purchased for her Kindergarten sister who has received her set, and her mother giggles just as much reading them to the next one. Yeah for Junie B. Don't know if I could pick a favorite -- other than the first one. To read Junie B is to love her. Books never get stale. Always a new idea for Junie B."
5,"Perfect, as always","I am a 47 year old man with a 6 year old daughter. I must confess that I read Junie B Jones to her as much for my own enjoyment as for hers. She loves the books and the character, but a good bit of the humor goes over her head. Like Junie B, she is in the first grade, so what seems so funny to a reader a little older just seems like the way things are to her. But we enjoy the books together.The best part of Shipwrecked is when the school play actually takes place towards the end of the book. Hard to keep reading sometimes because my daughter and I were both laughing so hard."
1,I like this book but....,"I like this book but, come on, THROW UP!!?? I got a sample and read it at the wrong time, IN tHE CAR! Ugh, my thorat, I almost did the same, Barbra Parks, you need to remember that 4 5 6 7 8 9 and older read this, and youngers do not appriceate that, or the olders."
2,It was O.K........,"I didn't really enjoy this Junie B., First Grader book as much as the other ones. I read the book to my little sister, and she thought that Columbus REALLY did swim to America. Junie B said it herself: YOU CAN'T CHANGE HISTORY! Yet Columbus didn't swim to the U.S., but the Junie B's class ""changed history"". I'm twelve and it confused me why Junie B took the blame, and seemed to make herself look good to do that and wanted people to thank her from taking the blame to make her look good. She is such a show-off, and Renée (my little sister)got mixed-up and thought the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria really did shipwreck. And she didn't get Junie B's grammer/speech."
3,Exaggerations; self-awareness; high-powered.,"High-powered playing; good ensemble; beautiful tone. But hardly one of the better sets of LvB quartets. Others may find merits in their style, but I don't. Indeed, I'm thinking of selling these 8 CD's as soon as I get around to it.What's the problem? Expresssive exaggeration; dynamics exaggeration; and too self-aware. And the speed is so broad that it's close to being annoyingly slow. Take the first Rasumovsky quartet (Opus 59, #1). The Orford takes 43 minutes to play it, about 3 minutes longer than most other ensembles. Consequently, no grip, a loss of tention, resulting in a complete lack of excitment.Presently I have 12 complete sets of these Beethoven quartets. And I rank the Orford at number 11, better than the Amadeus, slightly worse than the Hungarians, but a long way from the Budapest and the Italiano."
1,Hard-driven & Uninvolved,"I place this set with that of the Quartetto Italiano's performances of the Beethoven string quartets. While Italiano's set is just plain beautifully boring, the Orford set is equally boring because it is simply uninvolved. The Orford set is more ""high-powered"" than that of the Italiano, but the end result is the same. Slow tempos don't necessarily translate into ""expressive depth,"" and fast tempos don't necessarily equal ""exhilarating spirit."" Better performances and recordings abound at lower prices."
1,Very poor quality.,"I purchased this rifle and the mechanism that holds the BBs in place to be loaded into the chamber jammed. I swapped it out for the same model. After about 25 shots the pump would no longer pump. I never pumped it over 8 pumps and most of the shots only did 3 pumps. The manual suggests less than 10. I tried oiling it with a few drops of oil, but it still wouldn't hold air. The bolt isn't smooth and feels like it's about to break off when you pull it back to cock it. The scope is flimsy and slides out of it's mounted position. The accuracy grouping is poor. I stabilized the rifle with sandbags and used the scope to aim. Even at 25 feet it had 3-4 inches of drift in the grouping. In summary, two out of two of this rifle has been of very poor quality. One jammed after the first shot and the other failed after about 25 shots. I finally just ended up purchasing some shotshells for my .22 rifle and returned the Airmaster 77."
1,this gun does not work!,"I bought this gun for my husband some time ago for Christmas , unfortunately my husband was hospitalized and he has finally had an opportunity to open all of his presents. He tries to fire the gun only to find out it will not hold the air, there is no pressure at all. Can I still return the gun? It has never been fired."
4,Great pellet rifle,"As others have said, you probably don't want to shoot BBs out of this thing as it may damage the barrel. Others have also said that this scope is not the greatest and they're correct but with a gun with a muzzle velocity of 755 fps how good of a scope do you really need?I've shot about 350 pellets at this point and this gun is accurate (after adjusting fixed sights) and powerful. If you are looking something with more kick than a Red Ryder but less expensive than an actual gun I would recommend this."
4,Cant go wrong for the price,"This gun overall is great, but the scope is crap! I've tried to adjust it so many times, but it never comes close to the center of the target even at 10 yards!!! Maybe i just got a baad scope, but it is a very cheaply made.Now, the gun. It has great accuracy and groups very well. It also has good power after 10 pumps. It is kinda hard to pump, but it shoots sbout 800fps. Its great for goofing sround in your backyard or controlling pests. One bad thing about is that its pretty loud!! Its about as loud as a .22. Overall i think its a good gun, but terrible scope.Get a 3-9x40 scope"
2,remington air master?,I purchased this for a pest problem and the stock broke after 1 WEEK! no mistreatment unless you consider pumping it 10 times mistreatment... you can kill a squirrel at range.
4,good rifle but..............,"this is a very accurate rifle but the scope sucks, i recomend to buy another one like a centerpoint 20 bucks scope, it will work better than the original."
1,not so hot for me,"I guess it is completely possible that I could have just gotten a bad one, but this gun was bad enough for me that I'm not taking a chance and trying my luck with a second one. Gun returned."
2,"Good Value, If It Continues to Work","Once I got the sights adjusted, accuracy and repeatibility of aim seem better than my ability to hold the rifle steady. Construction seems solid. However, plastic gun stock is much too light affecting the overall feel and balance. Noise of discharge is much less than what I expected given the other reviews. Scope is made of relatively cheap materials but it seems to do the job. As mentioned in other reviews, getting the pellets in right can be a bit tricky. If it doesn't go in the right way, just dump it out and try again. For the price, I've no complaints.Update - Two weeks after using this product, it jammed on a pellet and there didn't seem to be any way of freeing it. Wound up throwing the gun away rather than incur all the time and expense it would have entailed to fix it."
1,what a piece of crap,"Remington should be ashamed for marketing this junk. I bought one and right out of the box it wouldn't pump up; the plunger had disconnected itself from the ram. I took it back got another, it work fine for about 25 shots and the same problem occurred. The only reason I gave it 1 star is so that this email site didn't think I forgot to rate it, and there is a possibility to sell this thing for parts if I find another misfortunate who was duped by the Remington name on it. Very disappointed and I refuse to buy anything labeled REMINGTON in the future because we all know how the ""screw me once, shame on you ........"" saying goes. Now figuring Remington's questionable reputation, I realize this thing was probably crapped out of China so Remington could make tons of money screwing the Americans; very disgusting business practice."
1,very bad QA,"Seemed like a great deal, great price, and a good brand reputation, but when my son opened it on Christmas, the gun had been assembled minus some rather critical parts (the pump tube was visibly empty--just a rod and nothing else). Either they shipped me a non-functional display model or Remington/Crosman has some poor QA. Sent it back for a refund and now have to look for another present. Tends to kill the mood. At least Amazon is good on returns (and thank you to customer service)."
5,Miss O'Day with an afro-cuban jazz quartet...,"O'Day sounds delighted in this sensious session, Anita never sounded as sensual as she does on this very jazz oriented set. Highly recommended as are all of her Verves. If you like Anita O'Day you might also try her latest CD on Pablo ""Rules Of The Road"" and if you want to see her live she performs regukarly at The Atlas Bar & Grill in Los Angeles."
4,Good Product,"I am very pleased with the product, I notice on the driver side, the lip seems to fold down a bit easier than I expected, but overall very pleased."
5,Fascinating View of Another Culture,"This was an excellent, enjoyable story. The close-knit Massachusetts community, engaging news reporter heroine, and focus on Cambodian refugees made for an engrossing, fast read. I could not guess whodunit and was swept along in sleuth Zoe's quest for the truth. In particular, I loved the references to Lois Lane. I used to read Superman in my younger days, so I understood Zoe's admiration of Lois's courage. I'm looking forward to another absorbing story by this author."
2,"Big promises, big print, big rip off.",Biochemistry made very easy is a very seductive idea. This book readsas a series of answers to the essential points covered in a typicalBiochemistry book on metabolism; almost like study notes on thesubject. The author makes no attempt to reveal the logic ofmetabolism and provide understanding that makes learning the subjecteasier. No chemical structures are in sight! Without structures everytransformation is a new chemical name without connection to thechemical name before it! This book does help you focus on the mostimportant parts of the material and doesn't overload you withdetails... The author self published this book and I think it'sbecause no one else would. He really is trying to make money withoutdelivering much. Disappointing... There is still a great niche herefor anyone with the talent to write a great book on Biochemistry madevery easy. Don't waste your money on this book!
1,Advertisers get positive reviews,"I've noticed a pattern over the years with Philadelphia Magazine: The biggest advertisers get the best reviews. The best restaurants who do not pay for add space, do not get good reviews or the ""Best of Philadelphia"" placards. I would not buy this magazine nor would I read it any more even if it were free. Get the ""Philadelphia Weekly"" or the ""City Paper"" for the most current advice on what to do and where to go in Philadelphia. They are what the ""Village Voice"" used to be: gritty, down to earth and very irreverent toward things we're supposed to like.I followed the bad advice of Philadelphia Magazine for the last time years ago. People who've lived here in Philadelphia for a long time, and are in the habit of going out, do not respect the integrity or quality of this magazine. I'm only reviewing it because Amazon insulted me by asking me to subscribe."
2,mag,each issue has huge ad promotion for lawyers or doctors also gives dates of events that have passed useless information classifieds are always the same pretty boring!
2,Shameless overlap between advertising and editorial,"While there are a few good articles each month, the magazine routinely runs features touting advertisers who just happen to have paid for ad space in the same issue. Many in-depth articles focus on Main Line social angst. Extensive advertising `special features' (which look surprisingly like articles) are regular features. I don't trust their restaurant picks - again, the longer reviews tend to go to the restaurants who run ads. I find the reams of ads for plastic surgeons and cosmetic dentists to be off-putting; I guess this reflects their target audience?"
1,Have not received,"This sounds like a great deal for the cost, but I have not received one magazine. Hope to see them soon!"
3,Disappointed,"While the item was shipped quickly, the color of the shirt was misrepresented in the image, and nowhere in the description does it mention the true color; pink. And when I say pink, I mean pink."
4,Myzery,"Uhhh, this CD was released on Psychopathic Records, so obviously it'll be reviewed good by juggalos. But otherwise, it's not a bad CD. It's got sweet beats and he raps awesomely in Spanglish (mixing english and spanish). Pick it up if you want somethin' new and fresh."
4,IT'S GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST,I am soooo down with the clown but this really isn't the best cd they have.
1,MISERAY IS A B*TCH @SS JUFFHOE CRACKHED EMINEM LUVIN B*CH B0Y,YO MANI HATE DOZE N|GGAZ MISERAYIPC N EVERY ONE KILLA HATES THEMi m GONNA CHOP OY0R CHICKN NECC UP B|CHI HAT UJUFFAHOEY0JULGG0ZGO BUY THE NEW PCI ALBUM : THE CLAMMFFSCL
4,This is far better than ICP- buy this instead,"There are far too many young people listening to ICP who have not already heard the prerequisite James Brown's Funky People vol 1, 2. Public Enemy. Souls of Mischief. Pharcyde. DeLaSoul. Tribe Called Quest. Eric B and Rakim. DJ Red Alert. Wu-Tang Clan. Search Amazon for one of these other artists and buy a record from black rap artists and not white boys (apologies to Beastie Boys and 3rd Bass). Then there are Funk essentials also: Isaac Hayes. Curtis Mayfield. Barry White. mid 70s Marvin Gaye Temptations. Bootsy Collins. George Clinton. Funkadelic. Ohio Players. and more. Please do not buy any ICP records until you know the roots of the medium that they are trying to ""Pat Boone."""
3,"Myzery is tight, but this isnt his best work...","aight, myzery has mad skill, but this is not his best cd to date.. if you want the best cd he made you need to find ""the red eye"" good luck tho cuz its so freakin rare. this album is good and i would recommend it to anyone into horrorcore or spanish rap. you can see hie new york style coming out on his rhymes on this cd. picture scarface meets wu tang and you go this album. its fresh but i would not pay over $25 for it. these people got you tryin to pay in reaches of $80 for this when you can go to ebay and get it for less. if you like icp you may like this but its not in icp style... the only song they are featured on is witching hour and thats nothing like the other tracks. if you can find tracks from his red eye lp than you are set and dont need this one."
5,This is a must have for beginning to advanced guitar,Artie does an excellent job in giving a blue collar description of essential guitar riffs for the acoustic guitar. I got a great deal out of it and I have been playing for 23 years. Well worth the investment. CD comes with it and helps the learning process greatly. A++
2,Just Another Riff Book,"I have about seven years on the guitar and am always looking for new material to study. I ordered this book, flipped through it a few times, and put it on the shelf with about twenty other books that cover the exact same ground. Just your generic, run-of-the-mill, riff collection. The majority of the riffs are just scale runs in different keys! I suppose if you're just getting started and looking for blues/rock ideas this may work (though there are thousands of these types of books out there)."
1,As expected,"Korn did it again. Same riff's, same sound, same lyrics, same style! Please Korn renew!! The first 2 albums were great, then it was time for a renewel because many bands stole the 'Korn Sound'. Korn didn't renew themself which means that they are musically dead. A pitty."
2,"I'm sorry, but... no...",I count this able as another Life Is Peachy. KoRn is a great band but this album was just... no... it was just a lot of yelling. I hope KoRn can come back and make another album that is better next time. I guess this one was just rushed.
2,Rap\Rock Heros Falter,"Korn musically, are at their peak! They can play and write excellent music! I can't stand ""Take A Look In The Mirror"". It sounds to rushed in production and sounds too campy! Jonathan Davis can't sing, stick to screaming! Take notes from bro Marky Chavez from Adema. He sings and writes kick ass songs! Korn is over and nu metal is fading. Bands are going back to metal and rock! Queensryche, Godsmack, Adema, Anthrax, Disturbed are most bands of 2004. Korn enjoy the money while it lasts. You may need day jobs! ""Issues"" is all this cd is about. Cloning unsuccess!"
1,Honestly.......,Come on face it... this cd suckskorn is only getting worse i mean think about itkorn - great albumlife is peachy - really good albumfollow the leader - plenty of good songsissues - .........like 5 good songsuntouchables ...... couple good songstake a look in the mirror ............... 1 good song (track 1)people will never stop debating it but there are 2 different types of fans out there.. the ones who like the early stuff.. and the ones who like the later stuff... there arent to many people who like every album except for those who just want to back the band up because of the real good songs they have made
1,"Metal? Well, I don't think so.","What can I say?! This album is a total crap! What happened to Korn? What happened to ""new metal""? Jonathan's vocals is extremely boring! This new stuff sucks, sucks and SUCKS! So far away from debut self-titled and Life Is Peachy!"
5,wow......,"when a band normally says there getting back to their roots its normally a lie, korn however did a good job at it. this is by far their best cd yet! its got everything old korn cds did, heavy vocals, heavy bass and g-tar and it has kick ass drums. this cd is perfect....my only problem is that they put ""one"" on there like 8 mins. after the last song...thats alittle annoying. but any ways you should definitly check this cd out. and dont listen to that dumb ass that just put down HAHAHAHA as his review."
5,"Undeniably, the most definitive album in stores","This cd has got to be one of my most worthwhile purchases of the year. So many bands have released new albums this year, but Korn's Take a Look in the Mirror stands above the rest. They have reinvented themselves, and proved that they will stand the test of time. When I heard that they were producing the album themselves, I was a little hesitant, especially after hearing Metallica's latest attempt which was ""under produced"" as well. Korn truly proved themselves to be excellent musicians, from a technical side as well. If you don't have this cd already, you should by it immediately. It will not disappoint. The bonus track, Korn's cover of Metallica's ""One"" is spectacular, considering the fact that it was recorded live."
5,Brilliant!,"Take a Look in the Mirror is brilliant. After very disappointing ""Untouchables"", Korn is back with their second very best album ( after ""Korn"" obviously ). The album has 4 masterpieces:Right Now 7/5 High energy son, very catchy, awesome vocals!Everything I've known 7/5 ""THEN WE FIGHT"" line sounds unbelievable.Did my time 7/5 Awesome song.Let's do it now 7/5 One of the best Korn songs, ""Break you downMercy, I cannot allow"" sound great!Great songs:Ya'll Want A Single 6/5When Will This End 6/5Deep Inside 5/5Counting On Me 4.5/5Here It Comes Again 4/5Break Some Off 4/5Absolutely stupid songsI'm Done 0/5Play Me (featuring Nas) 0/5And , yes, the bonus track ""One"". I'm speechless, I'm a very big fan of Metallica and Korn outdid Metallica here, WOWSo don't listen to people who don't like the album. It's an absolute must for a metal fan.Forget about a couple idiotic songs like ""I'm done"" and you'll get yourself a CD that is worth your every penny.Bravissimo, Korn! 4.8/5"
5,good komeback korn keep it goin!!!!,"this is a classic korn sound right here! this is what korn sound is supposed to be about! the last two albums were good, don't get me wrong, but they seemed to leave the sound they normally used, which is ok, every band likes to experiment. I hope korn sticks with this style and nothing else. Keep it up brothas, the your only ten years deep in album sales and the fun's just begining!"
2,pretty thrown together,"i didnt like this album at all. the only song i like is counting on me, i find it nice and depressing. the live performance of ""one"" is also ok, but id rather just listen to metallica sing it. besides that all these songs seem pretty thrown together. korn hasnt had a decent album since issues, and its starting to get pathetic. the only reason i didnt toss this cd was because of counting on me and its such a good song i rated this album 2 stars instead of 1. well anyways, if your looking into buying a korn album id try getting KoRn, Follow The Leader, or Issues, because as i said, this album sucked"
4,This is Good,"Dudes, noones ever going to agree on whether Korn is the dogs bollocks or not, so leave it! They havnt really taken a different direction, to me it seems like theyve mixed up all their old styles - and to be honest it is good music. now ure all gonna rant on about how much better thrash, hardcore and that stuff is, i listen to it, and i do love it, but i love this too! and there is nothing wrong with that. You are right, those bands are much more complex when it comes to instruments - but many of them dont have that something which korn does have to make all of their songs likeable. Ihave loads of Cd's with only a handful of songs that are really good, surely this is the case with every band? So give this album a chance, and to be honerst if u know u dont like korn, why bother writing a review, its just a chance to start slamming the 'grungies' for liking a band! Dudes, this album is good! dwnload stuff, like it says!!"
3,Good but not great,"Each of the previous Korn CDs has shown their development into the premier rap/metal band. Korn really put out a great CD in Untouchables, but I was afraid that there was no way they could match it. I was right. Take a Look in the Mirror is a worthwhile effort. It has a couple of songs with the intensity and attitude that was evident on Untouchables, but it isn't nearly the start to finish masterpiece that its predecessor was. I think that Take a Look in the Mirror will grow on me, but I was really hoping that Korn would take it to yet another level. I was disappointed."
3,IT WASNT THAT BAD,"YOU KNOW WHAT?!!! IT WAS JUST AN OK CD, I WAS A BIG FAN OF THEM WITH THE FIRST 3 AND MAYBE 4TH CD TOO BUT AFTER ISSUES, THINGS WENT DOWN THE DRAIN. IT DOESNT SEEM LIKE JON HAS ANY INSPIRATION, HE IS JUST TRYING TOO HARD, HE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE BASICS OF KORN AND DEDICATE MORE TIME IN MAKING MUSIC AND NOT MAKING ALBUMS FOR MONEY. I DONT WANT TO THINK THAT HE IS A SELL OUT AND KEEP THINKING THAT HE IS JUST NOT INSPIRED BUT HE DOESNT WANT TO BE FORGOTTEN."
4,A good album.,"KoRn as allways been my favourite band they allways have made great CDs but Untouchables was kinda bad, so i was ""affraid"" of this CD(Could it get worse?), let me tell ya that this is a great CD, not they're best, but a good one. If you like heavy music you should buy this now. The Old-School KoRn fans should also take a look cuz the band is getting back to the roots.""Take A Look In The Mirror"" Gets an 8 out of 10."
1,Blah...,Korn sucks. Korn has always sucked. Korn will forever suck because they make the same whiny music about a childhood so bad that having a mansion and a happy family won't make them forget about it. Wahhhhhhhhh.....
1,Not worth a dime,"I listened to this cd at the shop with the hope that Korn might actually be playing music after all these years and completely disliked it. This is a great idea to rip off cash from youngsters. I try to give a ""useful"" vote to every comment against Korn on these pages. Thanks guys, all you who have written what a piece of ***t this type of music is because I wouldn't bother to do it. Leave alone the people who listen to this because they are a lost case in terms of good music appreciation. By the way isn't the singer rich enough by now to stop bitching about how life sucks and stuff."
1,"Wow this CD is good, only not really","i have respected korn cds such as follow the leader, issues, and their first one. THis new cd is so horrible it is a whole bunch of crap mixed together. there is no talent within this cd, it isn't even catchy. i mean i know korn isn't some band with super talent and crazy guitar solos, but they have made good songs, especially on issues. i just want to say that a true korn fan would dislike this because they know what korn is about. korn is about making very rythmic melodies and melodic vocals to go with it. take a look in the mirror has neither of these, except for did my time. and that metallica cover was a mistake, mainly because the song ""one"" isn't very rythmic and has fast guitar solos, which korn is just the opposite. if you consider buying this cd i dislike your taste in music."
3,average!,"well,we will see...1)Right now-in my opinion, a rip-off of 'here to stay'2)Break some off-a death metal experience3)Counting on me-excellent Korn song4)Here i comes again-yes,here it comes again...the same old boring formula!5)Deep inside-this is good, a tortured soul communicating with the outside world6)Did my time-heard it b4,it's OK7)Everything i've known-zzz...8)Play me-hip-hop korn...aaaaaaaaaaaahh!9)alive-cool10)let's do this now-good n angry11) i'm done-OK12)YWAS-cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!13)When will this end-brilliant finisherbonus track:ONE-awesome!mmmmmmm,korn have a lot of pros (best band around,etc) and cons (they're old,and runnin outta ideas!)"
5,The Best Korn CD yet,"It's realy heavy, and the sound is realy good, if you are a real korn's fan this cd is for you, i got all korn's cd's and this is realy realy good, this is by far their best cd yet! its got everything old korn cds did, heavy vocals, heavy bass, guitar and it has kick ass drums. this cd is perfect....my only problem is that they put ""one"" on there like 8 mins. after the last song...thats alittle annoying. but it doesn't mathers, it's a Great album! Very rude!."
2,"Not really my thing, but don't let that stop you.","I'm a death metal fan, so take into account that I don't like Marilyn Manson or Slipknot. What I DO like are bands like Opeth, early In Flames, Edge Of Sanity... basically a band that's in your face but has melody to back it up. When I listened to Korn on the radio, all I heard was repetitive chord structures and excessively downtuned guitars. In my opinion, Korn is an overrated band, but as I connect better with Opeth's emotion and melody, my musical views are likely different than yours. I would recommend this to a nu-metal fan... but as a metal fan in general... no, sorry. 2.5 stars."
1,This is Terrible!,"I checked this cd out, because I have some of their old cds and I like some of them especially their self-titled debut. If you compare this to their awesome debut this cd is absoulotly nothing. They said that they would get heavier on their next cd, and then they go out and do a song with Nas? That's really heavy. I would reacommend you to stay away from ""Take a lok in the Mirror"" and if you don't have their self titled debut then you should go get that!"
4,Great Buy,"I keep things short and sweet. There were no scratches on the CD. It was in perfect condition. I would most definitely buy from them again, and probably will."
4,Awesome,"This is one of korn's bests cd's. Korn has finally decided to break away from the lighter stuff (issues, follow the leader) and returned to how the use to sound. It is refreshing to hear the raw energy and emmotion that hasn't been present since life is peachy. For all the people complaining about numetal bands like korn who did not even bother to buy this cd, why do you review this just to complain about korn? No Korn is not as hardcore as brutual death metal bands like cannibal corpose who pound the living crap out of their drums at about 500 times a minute. DOn't get me wrong i like death metal although death metal gets tiresome because it has no varation and It is literally impossible to tell one song or band from the next. At least korn has varation"
3,Ok....,"This cd is ok..... Korns old stuff is way better. Im not saying they are sell outs now (but everyone thinks they are)but they are just not as good as when they started. People are starting not to like this band because of songs like Yall want a single. Even though that song may sound like a sell out, the song really has a strong meaning."
5,Great cd,"For the longest time ,korn said that their trying to go back to their roots.Well they finally did,but with some tweeking.there are two things they should have done.Alive - was a demo from 1994,but done a little different.Yes it might have been awhile since the last time they played it ,but they could have used the demo and tweeked it a tiny bit ,they new version is a little low ,but hey its alright.One - Since they did the metallica cover ,they should have kept the live version on the ""Did My Time"" EP and they could have re-done the song in the studio and put it on TALITM.other than that the cd is very good"
4,Korn has better cds but that dont mean this one is bad,"they said it best about untouchables ""this is our masterpeice"" and after listening to it, it really is (except the god awful remix).when i first got this cd and saw alive was on it i was so happy but then after listening and jon sang instead of head it was disapointing (he did on the original demo which is much better) but songs like right now and did my time show korn can still make some great singles singles and there cover of metallica's one was a nice finish."
2,For KoRn an ..Peachy fans,"This review is just intented to early KoRn fans (from the first two albums, and follow the leader).I'm sure you guys are expecting some return to the old korn, because that's what the band's been selling in this album..well remember Metallica with St. Anger? ""this is our hardest sound and hardeest album"" well Anger sucked and sucked BIG TIME.This is almost the same...but not entirely. I'm sure you all hated Issues and Untouchables as i did but this cd is not that bad. I actually could hear it interely without really hating all the songs. J.Davis is screaming a little bit more like he used to, the guitars are a little bit more decent aswell as the bass and there's bo synth sound for our luck.Jon still sings some verses horribly but not as bad as Issues and U.If you want you may download some songs but DO NOT buy the album. Instead you could user your money in The Mars Volta or something like that."
1,"Don't go off what I say though, judge it yourself.",A Faith No More rip off with a wasp on vox and a diesel for sound Nothing you can get from more talented bands such as Slayer or Monster Magnet. Variation is less than the sights of a dry river bed with the personality to match. A lack of musical talent only rivaled by Slipknot's refusal to display it. And the cut myself thing works for emo bands in their first few releases and no one else. Nu Metal is a sinking ship and the bands are like rats.
2,|2.5| Korn's new effort is effortless...,"I definently looked forward to Korn's new release, 'Take a Look in the Mirror'. I've always enjoyed their heavy grooves. Unfortunately, Korn's new effort is effortless. The material here is straight up pointless, formulatic and flat out boring. You'll find plenty of catchy grooves on this album to be sure, but once you've heard it once, you've heard it enough. Creativity is lacking, and it seems like they made this album in two days just so they can go all out in concerts. There's simply no passion or dedication in this release; only pointless, heavy ramblings. Pass on it, even if you are a Korn fan. |2.5|"
2,korn on the slide,"now youre bein a bit harsh if u say 'korn' and 'life is peachy' are korns only truly great albums. 'follow the leader' helped kick start all that nu-metal and brought metal back to the masses. 'issues' was a retread of 'follow the leader' and only at times managed to match the quality of the bands first 3 albums. but even the most die hard fan would find it hard to defend the rest of their albums. 'untouchables' was at times lame and this album, dont even bother.what was that about burnin out rather than fadin away?....korn seem like theyre tryin their luck with the latter"
5,BLEW ME AWAY,"This album blew me away... I knew it was going to be good because I read all the hype but it is amazing. Hands down the best Korn album and the best album this year. It is heavy, intense, and angry. It has everything on it that one could want, heavy riffs, great bass, bagpipes and even a little rap thrown in. ""Counting on me"" is one of my personal favorites but it is a hard decision. If you like metal, GET THIS ALBUM."
2,What happened to you Korn!?,"I was disapointed when I heard this album. Korn has lightened up a little too much. I mean songs like ""Yall want a single"" and ""Right Now"" are really stupid. I gave this cd 2 stars cause I liked Break Some off, and One with Metallica. But other than that this album is really not good. Hopefully Korn will go back to their old self on their next album. I liked untouchables and all their other albums, but this album is just bad."
5,KORN IS AWESOME \m/(><)\m/,"it's an all together good album, what the hell is it with people giving it bad reviews.....some people can't just simply enjoy music, have to judge every way they possibly can i guess , anyways great album get it :)"
2,Only for a Die Hard Korn fan,"I loved the first 3 Korn albumns. They had something new and different to the music scene. Now...they really remind me of Metallica. Trying desperately to stay in a scene that has moved on without them. Issues was okay...saved only by 3 songs. Untouchables was god awful with no redeeming songs. So where does this CD stack up? Well it's a lot better than Untouchables, that's for sure.There are a few good tracks on this CD, so if you like Korn, it's probably worth the buy. Try to find it used though. After a while, all the songs seem to just be noise and a bassline that sounds cool, but don't stay in your head. Yeah, it's heavy, but what good is heavy if the songwriting sucks?I'm giving it 2 stars because it was better than I thought it was going to be, but definitely a lot worse than their hey day. Go buy the latest from God Forbid if you want the new breed in metal."
1,Garbage...,"I really consider korn to one of the worse bands and im also talking about their first cd which was terrible too and i dont know why people thought that korn's self title album was their best ? All of their albums are terrible period! I have listing to this in the cdstore because i knew they werent going to do noting for me so thats why it was given zero stars from me! There's no good songs here and if you want to be bored to death buy it but if you want some good music skip it!!!! Insted go for deathmetal because that's real music not this talentless nonsense... I would beg you guys not to go buy it but i know most of you are 13 year olds and nu-metal idiots with brainless music taste,that thinks korn as well as limp bizkit,linkin park etc... Are all good bands! Support deathmetal and leave the trash where it belongs!"
4,best korn album to date,"a massive improvement on untouchables wich was, in my opinion, i piece of s***.my favourite songs are 'break some off', 'alive' and 'when will this end'a must buy!!!!!"
1,Purely awful,"I was a Korn fan, a big fan until this album came out, don't these guys ever grow up? There is no real emotion anymore out of these guys, its all just talking about how insane you are, how many times have we heard Jonathan Davis say, "" I feel so insane""? It was very poorly produced, i can barely hear the drums, not that i would want to, they are hardly memorable, the guitars, pure garbage, creepy intro, chugging, dull, repetitive riff. they had the potential to be so much better but are confined to the image they wish to maintain. They used to evolve with every album, then they wish to sell more records so they ""go back to the roots"" what a bunch of sellouts. This is Korn's St. Anger, a joke of an album made to ""go back to the roots"" so they can win back the old fans and sell more records, both records were complete abominations and we are all dumber for having listened to them."
1,Sorry for my earlier Review,"But, the truth is that these people don't have ANY talent. Anyone could pick up a guitar, and play the tune of 'Did My Time.' Anyone should know that. And, it surprises me that they need 2 guitarists to lay the rhythm down. It's just the truth. And the drummer... I could do that stuff. Don't take it as an insult to you fans, I'm just telling the truth. And Death Metal has my support. Long live Extreme Metal."
2,Disappointment.,"Korn's new CD Take A Look In The Mirror was a big disappointment. Don't get me wrong there are some really kick ass songs on this CD. I was just expected more from an awesome rock band. Most of there songs have a similar sound. Songs that I really liked are:Right NowCounting On MeBreak Some OffDid My TimeYa'll Want A SingleDisappointing CD, but I am still a fan of Korn."
2,No use for a release.......,"You know Korn is a great band and all but I see it this way, ""Did my time"" , and ""Ya'll want a single"" are the only good kick azz songs on the album. (and oh ya whatever crapsac said that Korn did better on ""one"" than Metallica can suck on my sac)If Korn is gonna release a cd with only 2 good songs....well their is no reason to release or even buy this album. In my opinion ""Follow the leader"" was the best korn album ever. If you want a 5-star all trax kick azz album go and check out, Killswitch Engage......no better band than them!"
1,What is this?,"Are you call it rock music?Is it actually music?I think this is just a piece of crappy noise.Anyone can play this crap. Just buy a dicent guitar than bunch of sequencers, guitar synths, and aother stuf, and hit the strings. I'm sure you can be another korn musician, just call your band different name, something like ""Onion"", or ""Carrot"". Otherwise, these korn company will sue you for using they so called music.Have a nice day."
4,great cd,"one would say this cd is very good, it has many great songs but 'did my time' surely has potenital for being the single. its better than any other song on the cd. other songs like 'yall want a single' or 'Break some off' or 'Right now' will totally break peoples necks if listened to loudly. if your a good korn fan this a good one to buy but save a few dollars and get a copy. thats what ive been doing lately ;]. Dont buy the new slipknot cd it sucks."
3,Kinda dumb,"I love Korn. They are one of the pioners of nu-metal. I love all of there albums, except this one. Sure, there are some good songs, like ""everything i've known"", ""did my time"", and ""when will this end"". But, then there are the down sides, such as ""alive"". Has anyone else noticed that the guitar and drums in the chorus to ""alive"" is exactly the same to the chorus from ""need to"" from there first album. Also the lyrics to these songs are idioticly stupid. like from ""counting on me"", oh god the feelings i feel, will get me thrown in a cage. Honestly, who can rock out to those lyrics. I fell in love with korn's deep and intracate music, guitar, and lyrics, but this album is too dumbed down for my taste."
2,Not what i expected,"Wow, i was torn apart when i got this cd. It was pretty weak, even though yall want a single, lets do this now, are great songs, but korn could have down ALOT better. If u have never heard of korn before, dont buy this cd, go buy issues or follow the leader. This cd is weak, and doesnt live up to korns potential. Maybe its just me, but this cd defiently isnt like Korn, and is pretty pathetic...Other notables bands to mentionCoal ChamberStatic XMushroomheadPowerman 5000Skrape(great band)1st cd, not 2ndSlipknot"
2,"Well, it's heavy...","What can I say about KoRn's latest effort? Well, it seems as if KoRn are trying to please the fans that abandoned them after their first 2 albums rather than trying to better themselves as musicians. Sure, it's some of the heaviest stuff they've ever done, but that's about the extent of it. Nothing new or innovating and the quality of the music isn't that great, but it is loud, heavy, and angry. Admittedly, the first time I listened to it, I was blown away by the heaviness, but after a while I began to notice the same tired lyrics of pain and despair, the simple song structures, and that every song sounds similar. I would only recommend this to diehard KoRn fans. If you're new to the band this is definately not the place to start."
2,god what a mistake,"... the instrumentals for this cd are HOTT... but the lyrics suck so much... They ruined Alive, demo version is way better... and the only decent song really was ONE which is a cover by Metallica... Damn the next one outta be better"
4,They are back on track,People think that I am lying when I say that KoRn is the next metallica. They have reinvented heavy metal music over the last decade. Granted I will admit that untouchables was their worst album to date. But I do believe that metallica and all other bands have their bad albums too. To me this is KoRn's best album since their first one in 1994. This album has kick ass drums by david and fieldy really rips the bass g-tar in many songs. Head and Munky really tare it up on the g-tars and like always the lyrics on this album are deep and are really emotional. This is not their best album but it is really close. It is a definate buy if you like anything about KoRn or any of their past albums.
1,The fall of Korn...,"Wow...this is bad, and not in the good way!Every track sounds exactly like the previous one, all choruses are almost alike, Jon yelling and swearing perhaps to prove a point..but it get iritating to listen too...What happened to the choruses with meaning and complexety..(Freak On A Leash, Falling Away From Me etc.), maybe it's about getting hard and heavy and return to the roots... but this sounds nothing like early Korn...The first album rocks, this one sucks...big time! Untouchables was more enjoyable than this even though it wasn't that good. I've listened to the album three times, just to get something out of it...nothing!!! The track with Nas is the worst rap-metal mix ever!The album is the last Korn album i'm gonna buy, and this one will become a dusty one on the shelves...Korn have fallen, and they can't get up..."
1,Garbage...,"...Exectly where albums from korn belong, in the garbage. I find quite amazing that people actullie enjoy such godawfull ""music"" and call it good?Come on, whats matter with you guys? Korn has talent? No. It requires no talent, whats so ever to play anything from korn and not only korn songs makes you yaw but depresss you and gives a headache in a bad way! Folks, what korn does, is not music but simply noise of the worse kind. Do not by any chance support this trash!! Death to nu-metal !"
1,sell outs,After follow the leader korn sold out they say they went back to there old sound but I think they sold out there old sound in Korn and life is peachy is different I have not nor will I ever buy another korn album if you want a good korn album check out the above mentioned
1,Korn has lost it's edge,"I used to like what KORN did : Dark, profound, the sounds were various and innovative.... this album is a man yelling most of the time at the bottom if it's lungs with a non inspired band..... I bought this album blind folded I will be more careful next time"
1,Korn....Buddies....whats happened to you?,"Um, how should I say this so it'll make since to both sides of fans. Me, I'm an old school fan. I loved Korn and LIP, Follow the Leader was pretty good, but took a little getting use to. After that we all know what happened. They lost old fans and gained new. I had hope for them until Untouchables and then I just gave up. I stand by that statement. This is a not a good cd. It wouldn't be as bad I don't think if they had said (along with everyone else) that it was gonna be like the first two albums. You know if you say that, you have to live up to that statement. But they got the old school fans hopes up and then BLAH! It sounds almost death metal in some parts. I think they've made their statement and did great things for music, and now it's time to say goodbye. I hate these last three cd's, but still respect them totally. Fans since FTL, don't forget to eat your Korn."
1,HAHAHAHAAHA,"Korn suck man. HAHAHHAAH, Jon said this would be very heavy AHHAHAHAHAHHAHA, and theres a song on here with Nas! HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA, Yall' want a single? HAHAHHAHAHAHA. Oh man, this CD is hilarious. HAHAHHAHAHA"
5,Korn is metal,"ok...if you don't think korn is metal, what do you categorize them as?? they're harder than punk music, harder than emo and all that other b.s. you listen to metallica??!!! metallica is a piece of ****. They're last album sucked! you must not listen to good music if you think korn sucks. he's not complaining about anything, and his life did suck, he was molested if you didnt know that. that really messes a person up. the lyrics he writes are from feelings inside, you could never write half as good as him. the new cd is awesome all the songs rock, i suggest you actually buy the album and listen to it before judging them by what you've heard before, they are back to the basics."
2,Not So Good,"This modem is NOT korn..... It basicly is korn trying to make a rebound from UNTOUCHABLES. Intouchables made korn look like little girls...... After the release of that korn needed to find a way to make them seam hardcore again. So they threw together a quick album, never really put any thought into it. They released this album, and a sic video just to boost their image.In summary this CD is NOT korn, just something they came up with to boost their image."
4,Good but not great,When i first listened to this album i thought it was awesome. but after a while it gets boring. i think nas sucks and that most of the songs sound the same. If you are a real korn fan you should buy this album like i did.
1,bad one,"This is possibly the worst Korn album.. another Korn album in 18 months. All the songs sound same. The album has its moments but falls flat. Don't buy this one. It cannot please the hardcore Korn fans like me. What do Korn, Godsmack, and Staind have in common - they all sound same after couple of albums. Buy old Korn stuff. It sill rocks."
2,The Truth,"Dont listen to all of these Korn fanatics. Because no matter how crappy the cd is..they'll rate 4 or 5 stars . Honestly this cd didnt suck as bad as the previous 3 . But that doesnt mean this cd is any good. Its like they took their first cd and crapped it out and out came this cd. And it isnt even half as good as their first one, which isnt saying much. Korn..please, do give it up..you havent put out a descent cd in almost a decade."
1,Pathetic...,"This pathetic excuse for a band has been around since '94 and honestly? They never had any good songs. Korn's ""Take a look in the mirror"" is full of teeny ""angry"" songs that sounds very whiny & just plain annoying. I do not recommend."
5,Take A Look Into KoRn,"I own this cd and God!!!!, this was a friggin awsome cd. I've listened to it like God knows how many times and I love every single track on the cd. God it friggin rocks!! I love the range of singing Johnthan Davis has from hardcore rock to soft melodic, and back. Just three words sum up my review: ""This"" ""Friggin"" ""Rocks""!!!"
4,Another Great Album From Korn,"When Korn first came out I wasn't into them at all. I was still in the grunge seen. It wasn't untill 2000 when i saw them live I really got into them. Personally I think this is there best album to date. Its got great guitar riffs, great bass lines and jonathan davis does only what he can do on vocals. The only bad thing i found about the album is the stupid rap song with nas (i think it was nas) It is out of place in the album and isn't Korn's style. Probably Fieldy's idea, but overall if you are a fan of Korn its definately a must to have next to Follow The Leader, Korn, and Issues.(...)Peace"
5,Y'all want a single????,"When I first heard the snippets off the Korn website, I was peeing in my pants, it was like Korn the way I've always wanted to hear them. Finally got the album, all I gotta say is DAMN. This album is heavy, its fast, it has NAS and it even has the best cover of a song I have ever heard, Metallica's ""One."" This album makes me kinda glad they did Untouchables to make them realize that they can't put out crap like that anymore. I'm still debating if this album is better than their debut....just get it already.Standout tracks: Play Me, Y'all Want a SingleBTW: They also brought the bagpipes back!"
1,Are you people deaf?,"All right let me lay it out for you, Korn has lost it. Stop buying their poopy cds and move on. They were once a great band and now they are garbage... and all you people who are like wowzers what a great cd are idiots... clean the poop out of your ears and realize your a tag along fan that knows nothing of what this band once was... Compare their first album and their latest and you retards listen really closely maybe you will see the difference."
2,I Have not listened to this yet,But i read the review and had to comment on it. I write a review on a previous Korn album express my views on thier down fall and it is people like that Fred durst biggest fan that makes me Sick. Early 2003 he said he was a fan. I hope that he was being sarcastic. I first seen Korn on the MegaDeath tour as a opener in 1995!!!!! I hope that they will once agian put out a good album like there first but i also hope that i will get a bj at work while the world watches but neither will probally happen. Face it Johnathna lost his agnger and music skills.
1,Absolute Bollocks,"I will some this up pretty quick.If you like P.O.D. (and other crap like that), and you disliked korns early albums (s/t @ follow the leader) you will like this album.Those people who still have taste and ears, dont buy this, its bollocks. Korn have sold out. As you know they went down hill on issues and havent improved since, including this album."
2,KoRn Return With a New CD of Recycled Trash,"KoRn started out strongly with their self-titled debut. It was new, angry music that today's youth could relate to. Life is Peachy and Follow the Leader were a bit downhill, but they came back with the unique melodies and rhythms of Issues and The Untouchables. Now, however, they go back to sounding exactly like they did almost ten years ago. It's like their style never changes. They sound like the gimmick's up...nothing new is to be found on this album. It consists of different lyrics plastered on top of the same drab, boring riffs. And the whole quiet verses, loud, angry choruses thing is more than old hat by now. For a lover of angry, pointless, headbanging music, this might be okay. But for someone looking for a step up for KoRn, your best bet is to stay far, far, away from this old recycled trash."
3,not as good,ok...i was reading a few reviews and someoen said that this was there best album yet. another person said that korn is one of the greatest rock bands ever. youre both wrong. there only really good stuff is there old stuff. now its like pop music. its not rock and roll. they have nothing to say. its all the same. liek a few songs on there cds a little before this were all about raping girls. there pathetic now. they are nothing as good as what other bands are. this album does have a few decent songs on it though. and thats why i gave it 3 stars.
4,No se azoten!!,"Es un disco diferente a los anteriores, parece que se estan separando un poco de sus ritmos tardicionales, acercandose cada vez mas al metal tardicional, haciendo una mezcla unica y diferente. Deberian buscar a otro productor como Terry Date o Trent Reznor. Pero es bueno que sigan experimentando con su musica, es buen disco, pero no el mejor."
1,Unlistenable,Simply unlistenable. Stupid lyrics. All the songs sound exactly the same.Avoid this album.
1,sup,"korn is the worst band that has ever been on the face of this planet, called earth. we eat korn not listen to it. i hate to inform you all, that korn is good on the cob. but not good on a record. and korn is not spelled with a k, but with a c like such C.o.r.n. they suck...hahahahahhha"
5,Another underrated Korn Album,"Well not as good as ""Untouchables"" this album is right up there with ""Issues"" and their self titled debut ""Korn"". Yet again you get these so called Korn fans who think that anything the band does differently is bad but then complain when they sound too much the same. There is just no pleasing some people. This album has some stand out tracks such as ""Counting on me"", ""Im Done"", and ""Everything Ive Known"". These songs just make up what is overall a very solid album. Ture it is everyones right to dislike an album but when you get these zero star reviews from people claiming to be true korn fans it makes you wonder. What's funny is that some of the negative reviews are from people that openly state they are not Korn fans. Well then why buy or listen to an album you know your not going to like and waste your time with a negative reivew?? This album more than stands up on its own and shows that Korn is just getting better with time."
3,Their best is behind them,"As the 1st person to review this album I gotta say I love Korn but their day in the sun is over. Korn helped usher in a new style now called Numetal. Unfortunately like the genre Korn helped spawn they are now stale and without any fresh ideas. They blamed downloading for Untouchables not selling, when really the album sucked. Take a Look in the Mirror is an improvement over Untouchables but void of the energy and creativity found on the 1st four albums. If you are new to Korn get their self-titled debut, Life is Peachy, Follow the Leader, and Issues. Those 4 albums feature Korn at their peak. This album has nothing new or original."
2,Is this the turnback to the early years?,"Korn fans, I'm dissappointed. I was looking forward to the cd but there are only a few tracks which I really like:1. Did my time2. One (the Metallica cover)Grap the old stuff! You'll be better off!!"
2,Tisk Tisk Tisk,Dont get me wrong.. I love(d) korn.. but i mean come on. The lyrics are repetitive and so are the guitar riffs. There is like 2 good songs. And the rest are about how much Jon Davis's life sucks. LOL HE IS A F**KIN ROCKSTAR!!! GET OVER IT AND STOP WHINING!! Bottom line: Dont buy it download some songs and then go from there. Peace
3,Mediocre 6th Album,"As I said in my other reviews, Korn has always been one of my favorite bands. The problem is that the (...) on MTV got them overrated. I'll list the good and the bad about this album.Good:""Right Now"" is a great track that brings them back to their roots.""Ya'll Want A Single"" is a pretty funny track.Bad:Was it necessary to have Nas in one of their tracks?I don't like ""Did My Time"" that much.The band isn't what they used to be.What sucks even more is that Brian ""Head"" Welch ""found Jesus"" and left the band. He was a decent guitarist, but I got to admit that the death of Dimebag is even more sad, as that guy could wail on a guitar like no other! I have to admit that Pantera is better than Korn...Anyways, I'd only go for the songs ""Right Now"", ""Ya'll Want A Single"" and ""Everything I've Known"". The band isn't what they used to be anymore. 'sniff'"
2,consistent but a step backwards,"this album was consistent but a step backwards, all the songs sound a little alike - I thought the last 2 albums were taking them in new directions - this was a dumbed-down regression -what a dissapointment - there were moments it seems of brilliance and Jonathans vocal work shined nicely but the album tracks gave away to sameness.the song with NAS was interesting and the hidden live metallica cover were nice"
1,Why???????????????,"This is metal? Sounds like a cross between Metallica and Poison. Want real metal? Listen to Skillet's new one ""Collide."" Want it hardcore, Demon Hunter and Living Sacrifice are bands with real sound."
2,Another Korn CD,"Take a look in the mirror is by far the worst Korn CD to date. It sounds just like the first two. I'm guessing these guys are ready to retire, because they definitely have nothing new to add to the world of music. Why bother producing something that sounds rushed and unoriginal??? I love Korn, don't get me wrong I'm just pissed that I wasted money on this CD, just so it can collect dust on the shelf."
4,Not bad so far,"My Ranking of Korn CDs on 1-10 Scale (10 = best)9.9 Issues9.899 Korn9.880 Follow the Leader9.5 Life is Peachy8.0 Mirror2.5 UntouchablesI've listened to Mirror a few times through now and like it better each time. A good sign.At first I was afraid it was just more Untouchables. While it does have some similarities, fortunately it's got a lot more going for it."
4,Korn's 2nd best Album,"Yep, second best. for those who says that it sucks are haters.My favourite songs areRight NowY'all want a singlePlay meOne (LIVE)best will be Right nowMUST BUY ALBUM."
4,Forced Anger!,"I love Korn. Imagine being Korn. They are successful by any measure. They have a huge and loyal fan base, they are excellent live, they are respected by their peers, and they changed metal forever with Follow the Leader. Clearly their best work and for me it was their peak. How many different ways can you say I am in pain, life is a brutal prison, I hate you, etc.? They rock and will always get regular play in my house. I have read all the reviews that trashIssues and Untouchables and I don't agree with any of them. Korn was perhaps the most influential band of the 90's - they changed music forever. Think about metal before Korn. I hope they continue to experiment and evolve and look forward to the next step. To me Take a look in the mirror seems like a step backward - maybe that's what they needed. It is ALL-good though - if you like Korn pick this one up."
3,Lacking,"I hate to say it, but it looks like Korn's developed into one of those bands who's only hope at this point is to start producing. After peaking out with their last album, ""Untouchables"", they can't really go anywhere but down. Straight down, obviously. There's nothing new or innovative here, and Korn still hasn't taken advantage of the fact that they have TWO guitarists and should actually try harmonizing to produce a more intricate sound then the same old power chord riffs (guitar lessons, anyone?). In fact, the chorus for one of the songs (I forget which one) is remarkably the same as was used on one the songs from the first album. Wow. And though it is nice to hear them cover ""One"" by Metallica, they really dumbed down the song as only they can do. Like Metallica's ""St. Anger"", ""Take a Look in the Mirror"" is the result of a rushed album with little effort, but a least the production value's better...."
4,Old School,"Korn's getting back to what is KoRn on this ablum: pure dark and heavy rock.From a vocal standpoint, I'm not entirely sure I like the new vocal styles. There is alot of screaming among other tiring qualities.I personally feel this ablum is step back from Untouchables as far as vocals go (hence the 4 star rating).While the guitar riffs become rather familer by the end of the ablum, the rythem section takes a huge step forward, particularly the bass playing with both it's great new tone, and catchy grooves.This ablum is truely a combination of Korn's many musical era's and I feel it's a worthy addition their already diverse discography.In conclusion:I'd highly suggest sampling this ablum before you buy it, it's definitely not everyones cup of tea but it's none the less an excellent ablum by an extremely talented band."
3,koRn losing it,"i 've liked korn since before i could walk but this album is good but nbot good enough what happend to good old fashion KoRn . Why don't koRn write songs like Clown, TWist and Blind anymore ? Don't get me wrong this album has good songs like y'all want a single and especially right now but songs like did my time and alive are just a waste of space. I think KoRn's next album should be recoreded properly like the old korn albums or else it will be the end of a great band it will also be the end of nu metal"
3,GAmma Ray is beginning to sound repetitive...,"The production quality here is amazing, but Gamma Ray is repeating its formula, as most German metal bands are doing nowadays... ANyway, Kai Hansen is one of the most charismatic guitarrists of the world, and it's great to hear his voice and guitar all along this record."
2,LOST ALL THE MAGIC TO ME...,"When GAmma RAy began to replace musicians at will as somekind of modern BLACK SABBATH, I realized that thing would never be the same again. This album is clearly inferior to LAND OF THE FREE."
5,Sheer power and emotion,"From start to beginning, Gamma Ray knocked me right off my feet with this one! Fast, heavy guitar riffs and drums fused with an uplifting atmosphere, and Kai Hansen's flying vocals... need I say more? Gamma Ray have quickly become one of my favorite bands ever, with this album being a major contributor along with other albums such as ""Powerplant"" and ""No World Order.""I highly recommend this album. HIGHLY! Gamma Ray are without a doubt one of the most amazing bands out there, and if you ask me, they deserve to be as followed as Iron Maiden. Power metal seems to be a genre that is horribly under-appreciated, and because of its highly uplifting themes, there is no reason for most people not to enjoy it.Here are the three strongest songs on this album, as seen from my own perspective:1. Shine On2. The Guardians of Mankind3. Beyond the Black HoleUP THE RAYS! \m/ \m/"
4,Awesome Metal!,"Some really incredible stuff on this album. 'Beyond The Black Hole' and 'Somewhere Out In Space' are, in my opinion, among the best metal songs ever recorded. Other notables are 'Valley Of The Kings', 'Men, Martians and Machines', and 'Pray', but there's more goodies to be found here. Unfortunately, the last few songs feel a little forced. It's nice to get a CD with 14 songs, but quality is better than quantity, and there are a couple of real boners in there that kept me from giving this CD a '5'. But the good ones make it worth having in your collection. You'll never get enough of them."
1,Mammography,If you plan to take the national registry boards for mammography this is definitely not the book for you... I studied this book from cover to cover and not one question was remotely close to the info in the book... this book is just outdated and the registry test is extremely hard..
2,This book is written in the 19th century,"This book is written in the 19th century, and can be found free on the internet. As such, 71$ for a 100-page 100+ year old book is way too much. 7$ would be much more like the actual price."
3,Worth A Listen,"For the amount of press Lil Buddy and this album received, sales should have been much higher than they were. I think he sold 8,000 copies the first week after Lil Buddy's video was played almost hourly on BET and he was the featured artist in the then renowned ""Source"" magazine. It's too bad he was sent to federal prison for robbing a bank a couple of years back, especially since he had just signed a deal with Interscope Records a few months prior.Anyways, the main problem with this album is the mixing. The single ""Woo Woo"" was produced the same guy who did every other track, only it was mixed at Flyte Tyme Studios, the same people who help create Janet Jackson, Usher & Mariah Carey albums. Clearly the only radio worthy song on the album, most of the album was sonically one dimensional. Lyrically, it held it's own against many big selling artists of the time such as Nelly (Country Grammar), Jay-Z (Vol. 3), and DMX (...And Then There Was X)."
4,Good Wallet,Bought it for my wife and it met all my expectations. The quality is good and it goes well with the Small Pouch.
3,"Inexpensive, and built that way","Reasonably priced, but has somewhat cheap construction quality and feels cheaply made. It's already showing signs of wear after less than a week, and threads are unraveling."
2,Frustration,This game is very frustrating I used to play it on the original sega genesis and It was not very fun. My brother almost beat this game however if you want to play this game the mega sonic collection plus has this game it's still frustrating.
3,Sonic The Pinball,"The Game is decent however it can get boring at times and a little frustratingthe Graphics are decent, the Music is pretty cool, the Controls are a little 'rough'.all in all, if you want a pinball game, I'd go find an actual one3/5 (meh)"
4,Best if you're a fan of Sonic AND pinball,"Sonic Spinball is a game that fuses pinball and SEGA's mascot in one game. It has 5 levels, each made up of different boards. There are also 16, yes, SIXTEEN Chaos Emeralds to collect in this game, which, compared to the 7 of the others (not including Sonic 1), makes the game more tedious due to that it gets extremely annoying to collect the all-blue emeralds. Rings re-appear, but serve no purpose except for points. Experienced pinball players will take some time to adjust to the...different...physics for both Sonic and pinball.If you're a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, be weary of buying this game, same if you're a pinball fan. But, if you are fans of both, I can't recommend this game anymore."
3,Mostly lame,"About the gameplay: I'm not really sure what the point of this game is, but it is still pretty fun for a few minutes here and there. It is similar to a Pinball machine game, except that you are trying to progress through a level(s) by accomplishing tasks that are not made very clear at all. It seems like there is too much luck involved to make it a legit game, sometimes you will spin into the toxic lava stuff and there's nothing you could've done to prevent it. It also seems pretty random whether or not you hit the things that allow you to progress. Replay value is pretty low.Otherwise: The graphics are pretty terrible, probably at or below par with Sonic 1. The sound is kinda cool but pretty repetitive. The controls are simple like all Genesis games.Sonic fans, pinball fans, and collectors rejoice; everyone else stay away."
3,Mixed Selection of Food Writing,"This is a mixed selection of food journalism, with some very savory good food expose, and the other rather bland. The problem is that the book is 450 pages long, so sorting is necessary. The titles are deceptive. By them, this would be a fantastic collection. But they are deceiving, and the delectable title does not guarantee savory reading.I've consumed about half of this collection, and find some very sumptuous cuts, including a most delightful work by Escoffier on the Art of Cooking in Modern Society as well as John Ash's lovely story on lunch with M.F.K. Fisher.This is diminished by repeated bland works. Thus, unless one is willing to sort and read, this book becomes tedious and makes the price and effort less palatable except for the most interested."
4,Entertaining Reading for Foodies,"With Mark Kurlansky's reputation as one of the best food writers today, it was only a matter of time before a collection of some of his selections of good food writing came together. ""Choice Cuts"" is entertaining reading, especially for those who are interested in the history of eating and food. There are few recipes in this book, but this collection is more of a book that you sit down with a cup of coffee or tea after you've finished the dishes."
3,"Where is the ""world"" in writing from around the world?","Having been very impressed by Kurlanksy's earlier works, Cod and Salt, I picked this one up with much anticipation. Sad to say it does not live up to its word.Kurlansky's coverage has a decidedly Eurocentric tilt (read French) despite the occasional word from Nigeria or a quote from India. This is not ""writing from around the world."" There is also a lot of coverage devoted to MFK Fisher. That might be a good thing but it looks more like Kurlansky has decided to slap some nuggets together in time for the holiday shopping season. His usual exhaustive research is not exhaustive enough."
1,Do yourself a favor and leave this one alone,"I only have three words for this bit of tripe Boring,Boring,Boring."
1,Double Mijwiz,It's not playable...The mouth pieces are not even hollowed out.I'm returning it to the company.
2,You Get What You Pay For...,"I recieved an unplayable instrument, both pipes were not tuned to unison. I was told by the seller that they ""came like that"", and that I could return mine (at my own shipping cost) for a replacement, but with no guarantee of better quality. At the low cost I paid for this instrument, I was not about to waste more money on sending it back for another instrument of indeterminate quality."
1,very poor quality,"there is obviously no quality control step before shipping. my instrument is imposable to assemble because the bamboo itself is warped. even if i bought new reeds they still would not work because they will not fit into the instrument.i filed a claim to return my package, and they expect me to pay shipping. im not going to pay shipping twice to fix their mistake. i should have read the other reviews before buying. even though the flute is cheap, with shipping it was right around ten bucks. not at all worth ten bucks for some useless bamboo. i can get free bamboo just about everywhere in the world. i don't at all recommend this seller."
5,Review,"I really like this instrument, but it is really hard to learn.The instrument it's well made and has a good sound."
5,"Read it years ago, and it still sticks with me","This is one of those books that i have read once and still think about a lot. It was a wonderful book. However, the ending is gripping, and obviously incomplete. I have searched frantically for the sequel, but i too have been unable to find it. ..."
2,"Gory, Bloody, and Unsatisfying","Lori Martin, on some levels, did a good job on her book ""The Darkling Hills"". For example, her writings of the gods (given as writings from The Book of Gods)clearly and almost lyrically explain who the gods are and what they represent.Unfortunately, this book was a tad too gory for my tastes- anyone who isn't too keen on seeing the blood of a lover poured out onto someone else (from the flasks of an old woman, no less, while a girl's friend watches and claws at the walls) should skip that part of the book. Perhaps Rendall's death is necessary to the plot, but we are not told how he dies- just that he gives himself to Sanlin to save his beloved and their unborn child. In the end, the beloved dies anyway, after having birthed twins in the midst of a war that her people are losing, while being chased by her psychotic, murderous uncle..."
5,This is the BEST album I own,"Even though many people in the states have not heard of this truly great artist, I believe that she is worthy of fame even in the states. This is a great album and it is a bit more rock than the rest of her albums which I think makes this the best album she has ever made. Every track on the CD is great. I like the track ""Welcome to my Truth"" the best though. If you have only heard a few songs like ""Left Outside Alone"" and ""Sick and Tired"" and loved those, you will really love the rest of the CD."
5,Super!,"I did not really know Anastacia's music until recently. A few weeks ago I saw her in concert in Slovenia and was just amazed at the voice, the music and the fantastic person behind it all. I bought this CD and have listened to it constantly ever since. It is a really great piece of work! I especially enjoy sick-n-tired and heavy on my heart."
3,"Amazing Voice, Uneven Album","As with her previous CD's, Anastacia's latest sports impressive vocals but, often, less than stellar songs. With a strong and soulful singing style (yes much like Taylor Dayne) Anastacia can elevate plain songs and make them more interesting. A true credit to her talent and charisma. But once again she fails to write or receive A-list songs that match her A-list voice. With the exception of Left Outside Alone and Heavy On My Heart, I found myself wondering and wishing she had written with more standout and experimental producers. More often than not Anastacia's music sounds as if it is ten to fifteen years old-a dated sound (by album three) that I am now wondering if she is responsible for encouraging. Still, if you are a fan of power vocals and a truly engaging vocal style this CD is worth buying."
2,Anastacia Back!,"The third time around Anastacia releases a self-titled album that has a couple of hits but fails as an offering. The only two tracks worthy of release are the ones that have been. ""Sick & Tired"" is arguably the powerhouse diva's best song, carefully structured and multi-influenced. ""Left Outside Alone"" is another perseverance stand with loud vocals.The rest of this new release relies on producer hand-me-downs and mushy material. The hits, however, are worth the time."
4,Great product,"Bought this product hoping my daughter would get interested in the outdoors, and it worked. She went around collecting bugs and such asking all kinds of questions."
3,Bug watch,My children were very excited to receive these watches. The only problem I came across was that the netting is very delicated and quickly became damaged with holes.
1,horrible,"This is an unbelievably cruel and thougthless thing - it's torture for any animal. Think, feel - and DO NOT BUY!"
3,Why cut the songs in half?,"This is a wicked cd but why did ICP cut the songs in half? This album contains all there singles from ""The Tunnel Of Love"" way back to ""Dog Beats""(When they were Inner City Posse). ICP tried to fit to much on 1 cd so they cut the songs in half all accept ""The Neden Game""(Alternate Lyrics)which is a rare track and House of Wonders which is also on ""Forgotten Freshness"".Why the hell did they not release a 2 cd album with all the songs in full? If you want all the rawest sh*t, buy ""Carnival Of Carnage"" or ""Beverly Kills 50187"". If you are a collector like me you should buy this to get ""The Neden Game""(Alternate Lyrics). I only gave this 3 stars because of the songs being cut in half and also they don't even list the song names on the back(!), but this is still a heeps cool cd!"
5,whoop whoop,"Love this CD, i will be down with the clowns till im dead in the ground. whoop whoop. Much Clown love"
3,A good product,"I ordered this one in the Winter and tried it on my right knee and worked pretty for the first two time. But it slided down on the third time,luckily I wear pants so it didn't show in front of friends. I don't wear it when I go out anymore."
1,Don't Bother,"This story made no sense at all. The end message seems to be that the fatter and lazier you are, the better! The illustrations were bad, the writing was poor, and the story was boring, convoluted and with the aforementioned nonsensical ending. Blech. Just blech. Don't bother with this one."
1,Buy something else,"I found this book to be somewhat horrifying. I couldn't even finish more than half. If you are having serious problems with your marriage this book is not for you. Joyce promotes giving up your needs for your husband's and constantly defering to his opinion, which won't likely work unless you have an honest, intelligent, hardworking, compassionate, reliable husband. Save your money. See a Christian counselor. And try Joyce's book ""How to Succeed at Being Yourself."" I liked it very much and I think you will too."
1,"Help Me, I wasted my time and money!","This book is basically the story of Joyce and Dave, an emotional basketcase who is saved by her saintly husband. The whole thing seems to be therapy for the author while dispensing very little that isn't obvious or just silly. For example, when discussing conflict- ""If your husband's face is all contorted and you think, My, he looks strange, you are probably making him mad and should back off."" She later goes on to state that if your spouse has a different personality trait than you, you should ""forgive"" him, and a woman should never be too tired for sex. Most of her advice is only applicable if you have a perfect husband and you are willing to fully submit to him. Instead of buying this book, take your spouse on a date, it will be a better use of your time and money."
2,Out of reach,"I listened to this album a few years ago, but in contrast to all other HB records, I didn't feel the need to buy it. Some tracks contains these cheesy, standardized pseudo-techno beats, pretending to be modern. The melodies are weaker than on other HB albums, and the whole CD sounds as if it was done in a hurry. Better check out HB's collaboration with XTC's singer Andy Partridge, ""Through the hill""."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!,Boring! Absolutely nothing worth while here. I hate that little drum and base beat that permeates this CD and a million other ones. Also greatly dislike the phoney vocalisations with pseudo-emotions. Some of the synth effects are allright but not worth the purchase of the CD. I thought I should warn you.
5,Who doesn't love Shirley Temple?,"This is a great collection and a MUST have for any Shirley Temple Collector! But who doesn't love the original Child Superstar? She is funny and timeless, way before even my Mom's time and both my Mom and I and my nieces love her! This is a non-generational must watch family movies, that not only are funny, fun and entertaining, but help instill values that seem to have been lost in our times! This collection will make you laugh and cry as Shirley draws you in with every word."
5,My Table and Chairs,It's beautiful ! It goes with my carpet and house great. It's easy to clean. I don't know if it was easy to put together because my husband did it.
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"It seems every time Special Agent Antonio Burns goes climbing somebody happens to die. You would think he would learn his lesson.I wasn't excited to read this book. I am not a big fan of climbing or camping or outdoor sports. I enjoy legal thrillers and thought I would trudge through the obligatory adventure scenes. Surprisingly, it was the action that takes place on the mountians and lakes of this book that win you over. Burns is an instantly likable character. What makes him even more likable is the people that surround him. McKinzie has a knack for creating extemely dispicable character. During the reading of this book and his other Burn's book Edge of Justice I found myself getting really angry at the corrupt characters. At points I was squeezing the edges of the books until my hands turned red."
2,My First And Most Likely Last Book by McKinzie!,"Point Of Law is the first book by Clinton McKinzie, which I decided to read based on the positive reader reviews it generated. Unfortunately for me, I didn't enjoy it very much and, thus, will probably be the last book by Clinton McKinzie I'll read (at least for the foreseeable future). The plot started off interesting and exciting; however, what ultimately developed was mostly predictable. Further, I found the characters to not be particularly well developed, resulting in my not caring one way or the other about what happened to them. The main mystery for me was to see if I could make it to the end without resorting to skimming pages. I must admit that I did not succeed in doing so. If I was to rate this book with a word (rather than a number) I'd assess it as a ""fair"" read. With so many books out there and so little time to read them, my recommendation is to skip this book -- unless you have a strong interest in rock climbing."
3,Unuseable,I'm sure this slide copier is an excellent product but I cannot try it out because the wrong size adapter ring was sent with it - my Sony DSC R1 has a 67mm lens so I need a step down 67-58 adapter & not the 58-52 I was sent
3,Nice contraption but does not work on my Sony DSC R1 camera.,"The price was low enough so i can just shrug off the fact that it doesn't work on my camera. Maybe I can make a lamp out of it! Ouch, a big woman just sat down next to me and crushed my hat. I'm falling asleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
4,"Incomplete, but a good intro","This book gives a well-prepared introduction to CORBA. In that role, it succeeds admirably. Be warned, this book should not be considered a complete overview. There was a lot of info left out: error handling, optimization, ORB configuration and others. But, if you do want an intro into the world of CORBA programming, and just happen to know how to program Java, this is where you should start."
1,"Trash it guys , its outdated",The Book is really good if you HAD bought it 2 years back. Now the corba 4.0 has changed most of the keywords and this book doesn't help you now.
2,A big book with little detail,Most of this book simply compares various client/server technologies. If that's what you're after then this book is for you. If you're after some good info on CORBA then find another book.
5,Very good for beginners/intermediate users,"I would definitely recommend this book, especially for the beginner-intermediate level. The concepts are covered well, but a bit more complicated than needed. This book gives you a lot of very useful examples and I found minor bugs in very few of them. Overall the book would be good as both the desktop reference as well as a study guide."
3,No focus on CORBA,"Good book to introduce CORBA and some advanced features of Java (e.g. JDBC, Java Beans, EJB...). It introduces also a brief description of CORBA competitors (DCOM, RMI...). It will deceive those who are only interested in Programming CORBA with Java."
2,Check carefully,"You may think because of the book's title, that this will teach you programming client/server.It won't.If they would call it 'proof and compare client/server programming and architectures' I would give it 5 stars. It also might be confusing if you aren't familier with this things, because there is now explanetion about the code ,so you must have written some client/server if you going to buy this book."
1,This book is BAD!,"The author is more like a car dealer rather than a technical writer, the book is hollow and this guy used to write some volume also very bad, such as Client/Server programming. I regret so much that I waste some time on this.This book is junk."
2,Not very good,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It seems like quite an accomplishment to pack so little info in so many pages. First of all it left out many of the very essential parts of CORBA and instead concentrated related technologies things like EJB.In addition the comparisons ranged between slightly inaccurate to completely inane. They were so CORBA-centric, that they neglected to acknoledge the weaknesses that it has. And they compared things that don't warrant comparison such as Servlets and CORBA which are in NO WAY competing technologies.The only parts that I found vaguely useful were the tutorials some of which were well thought-out."
4,Quite big but good.,"This is a huge book. But as I started reading, every thing started making sense. I have heard/read some nasty things about the ""runnability"" of some example code. But that does not bother me from giving a good rating. Because all I am after is only the concepts not some reusable sample code. People who might use CORBA may also need to pickup conepts related to their application server environment as well. It will be good if authors can include a review of all application servers that incorporate Java and CORBA in to the middleware solutions."
2,Too verbose to be of practical use,"Orfali and Harkey tend to be too expansive. While this could be OK if what you're looking for is detail, the time needed to get a simple answer from the book on any given question, makes it prohibitive to use the book as a reference. Even as a textbook, the book is too verbose and details things in such excruciating detail that turns the hurried reader away. People who are in a hurry to get a jump start or quick answers should avoid this book."
3,good ideas but code is not for UNIX people!!!,"Let me be critical. This is not a serious book. I had a tremendous difficulty trying to run the examples on UNIX (IRIX), and I finally gave up. The authors obviously had WindowsNT in mind when they wrote this book. I finally could have some code compiled under NT.I am pretty sure most users have given up trying to run the examples in the book.Finally, I did not find the book as invaluable as when I first looked at it.This is my opinion but I believe many users have the same feeling.Zebulon"
1,Attempting to stop the unstopable,Very biased unfounded claims about Java RMI's future. The practicioners of the old paradigm try desperately to throw dirt on the new one. They never established why doing CORBA with java would be a good idea. CORBA fans might find it very biased towards Visigenic
4,The best CORBA book for the starters so far,"I believe it's the best down-to-earth book so far for anyone who wants to start learning CORBA. Don't expect anything fancy from this book, but once you're done reading - you may start actually looking into vendors documentation."
1,"Made Cat Sick, Cost $200 to Fix, Company Wouldn't Reimburse","I purchased a bag of WellPet's Wellness Complete Health (blue bag) dry cat food at a local pet store. I wanted to bring my experience to your customer's attention so that others won't have the same problem. The food caused my cat to have a serious urinary tract infection that required a vet visit and special food to cure. The total cost to me in out of pocket un-reimbursed expenses was close to $200. I contacted Well Pet several times to request reimbursement, but they ultimately refused even though my Vet told me that the food was likely the cause of the problem. Please advise other customers of this potential problem so they don't waste their time and money on the product, or cause their pet to become painfully sick."
5,After Hartshorne!!!,This book is very good for the secondary course after learning with Harshorne's Algebraic geometry.
3,Fire Lover,"Transaction was good; however, I would not consider this book in ""good"" condition, as stated when I bought it."
2,Not so hot!!!!!,"The first half of this book is riveting. It tells of an arson expert who sets his own fires. The book tells where and how he did it. He was always the first one on the fire scene and knew exactly where the fire originated. I have a high respect for Joseph Wambaugh, and am so sorry that this book didn't do anything for me. The second half of the book is just so boring with legal turmoil, and finally a conviction. But now I do know how to set an arson fire and not be caught Woo hoo!!!!!!! Save your time and money. It's just not that good."
5,One of the Best Salsa Albums of 1997,"A cliche for a lot of albums is that the first song is the best one; that is true in this case. Tracks 2,3,5-7 and 10 are decent songs also."
5,worked fine,I bought this and had no problem installing it. Clear instructions and saved a of money doing it myself. You can do it yourself also.
5,Good People of the World unite behind Lord Wizard,"I could not put this book down! The unification, at least temporarily,of forces of Christendom and Islam to protect the Holy City,Jerusalem, was a masterstroke by Stasheff. If you love the historical ""what if"" he puts into this series then this is his best work to date! The story unfolds with a little girl being given up by her mother in the care of the Elements [literally] to protect her from the evil Horde! Now an orphan in the world,little Balkis is cared for by Nymphs and Dryads. Most of the old favorite characters make appearances and there are several new ones introduced, most importantly we get our first real glimpse of Matt's children."
2,a disapointment,"The first book in this series, ""Her Majesty's Wizard"", is excellent. This book is not. Contrary to the cover and the opening chapter, Matt plays a supporting actor, not the title role. Matt's interesting personality, actions, and introspection do not appear in this book.""The Crusading Wizard"" focuses on a girl wizard who can change into a cat. Her personality is flat and uninspired, both as girl and cat. Much of the charm of the first book in this series was the portrayal of a midieval society through another mind set: angles & devils are living creatures, ""good"" and ""evil"" are absolutes, and kings rule by divine right. Discarding that whole notion, ""Crusading Wizard"" is simply another midieval fantasy world with magic, nicely executed but bland."
3,Moving up to a larger stage,"Book after book, Matt Mantrell (from our Earth) has been saving Merovence (France) from evil. Now, he has to save civilization from the mongol hordes. He and his wife Queen Alisande lead the Frankish armies to join in a Crusade allied with the Arabs, against the Turks and Huns.Unlike some of the WIZARD AT RHYME series, this does not go much into the Catholic way. It suffers, however, from Matt having too many friends, all powerful, and all willing to pitch in and help out. I'm a fan of Stasheff and think this is one of his better series but I agree with the authors who say that it's getting old. Introducing new characters (especially Saul way back in Book 3) helps (I'm not that big on Matt's parents--they sort of remind me of the left-over lovers in a Romance Novel sequel), but I think Stasheff will want to leave Matt alone and focus on other characters altogther if he doesn't want this to become just another hero wading through evil series."
4,"1/2"" walnut flat top plugs","Plugs showed up in good order. Plugs were consistent with advertised size and shape, making them easy to work with. They were used in combination with a rustic hickory plank, and the walnut coordinated nicely. Sanding to a flush finish was a breeze, and we had no chipping or splitting issues like you sometimes see in cheaper plugs. Much quicker and cheaper than making our own plugs. Doesn't get a five star because the shipper takes what seems like forever to get them in the mail. We waited 10 business days for delivery on an in stock item."
3,Romance for 4-8 years olds ???,Janette Oke is a wonderful author and this is a well written series. The reading level is for ages 4-8. My concern is whether it is wise to introduce romance to girls at such a young age? I don't think so and hence my lower rating.There are plenty other excellent historical fiction series and clsssics for that do not contain romance that I would rather see my daughter reading.
5,Christian non fiction,Great book about a young women and her brother and the sacrifices they make to raise their siblings after their parents die in this time period. Love the series and all of her books. Good character development. You feel you understand what they are going through.
2,A critical analysis,"In reality, I think SOME of us have learned so much about Pokemon already that we don't need this book. I also think that the author isn't asking the right kids for his books. For example, in the first book, there was about 5 pages citing kids arguing on which Pokemon is the most ""powerfulest"".The question on whether this book is helpful or not is completely based on how much the reader actually knows already. In my opinion, his view towards Pokemon is not a strategical view, and if it is, it's not enough."
1,Awful!!!!!!!!!!,"It is so awful that it only gives you tips by things you would already know. It shows you stupid qestions that you don't need. all it shows you the basics and stupid stuff that you could already know. Sorry if I'm using ""stupid"" so much it's just so useless. The only thing is useful is the checklist.I recomend do not buy it or you would waste your money big time."
5,FRAMPTON COMES OF AGE AND AGILITY,"I truly enjoyed this Peter Frampton album! Like alot of people I got really burned out on ""Frampton Comes Alive"" back in the 70's because of the constant airplay and it's POP music venue.Being a guitarist myself for 42 years I practiced and played to always reach a higher and more professional creative level.Frampton has done that in this album.It's entertaining but it showcases Peter's true playing ability and his creative ability teamed with fellow composer Kevin Savigar.When my friends hear this CD playing in my truck they are very surprised to find out that it is Peter Frampton & usually want to know where I got it.Very entertaining,excellent songwriting, great guitar chops,great arrangements,somewhat pop-rock but not repetitious nonsense that is so prevalent these days,also has some great blues tunes.Great listening experience over and over again."
3,its OK,"Not want I had expected...NOT the energy that is in Peter's ""live in Detroit "" CD. Would not bought if I had heard the selections beforehand."
4,Frampton Still Alive!,"After being put through Pop Star Hell by eager promoters, Frampton returned to making the kind of music he loves. Unlike many others among his contemporaries, he has continued to grow as a guitarist and all-around musician.This album is a fine collection of different musical moods and textures that explore many sides of this multifaceted artist. Frampton even includes a hot guitar instrumental that harkens back to his days with Humble Pie, as well as his earlier influences (Hank Marvin in particular).I highly recommend this recording."
5,Best of Tozer,What's not great to say about Tozer. He is one of America's Greatest Preachers of all time. Read slowly for full impact. Definitly not a fast book to read.
4,Dickie does major damage to evil do'ers,"Dick Marcinko and his band of merry men continue the legacy of beer drinking, nasty talkin', hard hitting action in the pursuit of the evil doer's of the good ole' U.S. of A. Just so I don't give away the plot and have Dickie visit me at my own abode some night with a C4 suprise package, I'll just say this adventure tracks right along with his usual style of commentary and Navy SEAL tactics until the bad guys end up properly chastised (and dead). If I didn't have it on good authority that Marcinko really is as nasty as he presents himself to be, I might wonder if these guys really are presented in a realistic manner. Since I DO know an ex-SEAL that IS acquainted with Dick, I guess I have to believe these guys really are nasty bad a-- m----r f-----s that I hope never to meet except maybe at a book signing fair. (Please Dick, if this review offends in ANY way, I profusely apologize and promise only to read the book and never write again."
3,SAR,Same old same old. If I had to choose between watching paint dry and reading this book I would choose the book. Too much unreal drama. I would prefer to hear more about the authors military service which I'm sure is quite a story itself. The book IS advertised as fiction and it certainly is that. I don't recommend it. Save your money. Demo Dick has plenty.
4,Task Force Blue is entertaining,"In the way that karate movies are entertaining. Lots of cool action parts and a storyline that doesn't quite make it to good.The writing style is very similar to all of his sequels to the original Rogue Warrior book. Not quite redundant in my opinion, but almost.A decent enough story, really good slam-bang double-tap action, I'd only recommend this book only to fans of action-adventure books and fans of Richard Marcinko."
2,Sequels always seem to lack,"Rogue Warrior was a great book. Red Cell was not bad. However, Task Force Blue is not only redundant, it is redundant. If you know what I mean, gentle readers. Do not expect the same true life, fast action as the original Rogue."
3,"Great Playing, bad recording.","Shiflin is an amazing artist, probably among the top 3-4 Clarinetists preforming today, but the mixing on this recording is terrible and muddles his sound."
5,Lovely,"I love anything by Mozart. Recently I wasviewing on DVD The ""Inspector Morse""series from England. You probably know howmuch the Inspector loves opera and classical music. When I heard this piece inthe background I wanted to know what it wasand then something that rarely happens;he was asked the name of it. By the way,the ""Inspector Morse"" TV series is absolutely the best series ever made. Theacting and scripts are magnificient."
1,Bad Low Freq. Hum,"Returned this years ago due to the very bad audio rumble of the recording. Playing was great, just a poor audio recording"
3,Not the authority on Mozart,"I will admit, Shifrin provides a fairly musical rendition of the Mozart Concerto and Quintet. However, there is too much rubato used which is not stylistically appropriate for Mozart. Also, as a clarinetist, I have always looked to the true master of Mozart's clarinet works: Robert Marcellus. John Manasse has come close to the perfection displayed by Marcellus, but Shifrin cannot quite compete. There are undeniable intonation problems in this recording of the quintet, which is difficult to avoid, but not worth paying $15+ for."
3,More for the professional than the lay person,"This is something of Will Eisner's lifework, the non-fiction complement to his wonderful work from the 1950s onward with _The Spirit_ through _A Contract with God_. Herein, Eisner describes the means by which his stories work, what makes them flow and live. Before Scott McCloud's _Understanding Comics_, Eisner was the standard bearer for the explanation of how comics achieved their effect. But this book never got the acclaim that McCloud's did, for it is not necessarily directed at the public, but at the would-be comics professional. In fact, most of the book is a reworking of Eisner's lecture notes from his teaching time at New York's School of Visual Art. The general public can still glean some great information about the medium from this book, but McCloud has supplanted Eisner as the popular textbook for courses on comics."
5,"""Comics and Sequential Art"" is a fantastic book.","Eisner is an acknowledged genius in the field of Sequential Art. His graceful and knowledgeable approach to his craft make this text emminently readable, and you never forget for a moment that you're learning from a master. Filled with fantastic and dramatic pages of his own comic work, the book effectively imparts the technical understanding you need... with concrete examples that are FUN to read. I've been drawing seriously for over 15 years now, and found this book tremendously helpful. I think anyone would."
2,What a disappointment...,"After reading the reviews of this book here on Amazon, and running across mentions of this book in lots of other places that talk about comics & graphic novels, I was really looking forward to reading it. But on the whole, I've been very disappointed. Although the book covers a lot of relevant topics, it does so in a way that seems sloppy and self-congratulatory. The book could do with a thorough proofreading to catch the numerous typos and other errors, and the author seems more concerned with impressing the reader than in making the topics easy to grasp and apply. I'm really surprised to find that this isn't a better introduction to the art & craft of visual storytelling."
2,Not the best,"It was the best book to get. I needed it for my class and didn't refer to it much since it didn't even help.My copy was also in very bad condition. Taped and was previously wet so yeah pretty bad.It was also a different printing, so it looked old."
3,pretty good for beginners...,"I rank this book at the same level as Understanding Comics. Both are good texts for the novice or someone with little knowledge of how panels, pacing, etc. function. However, for someone really serious about getting into comics I would suggest books such as The Five C's of Cinematography (as well as books dealing with the understanding of basic storytelling from scriptwriting to crafting short stories) and any of the reprints of Alex Toth's various comics work. What these influences add are both a better understanding of specific types of shots and framing (both Eisner and McCloud strike me as too vague) and an understanding of how and why comicbooks adhere to certain principles of filmaking (both in terms of layout and storytelling) and still must adhere to the limitations and advantages of the printed page, which Toth handles masterfully."
1,Absolute garbage!,"These are absolute garbage! I purchased them on accident while trying to buy the 5-in-1 test strips, but thought I would go ahead and use them anyway. I have followed the instruction perfectly while testing water from my 150 gallon Fahaka tank, and the reading shows the maximum, 6.0ppm ammonia each time. Any puffer would be long dead as those levels! I have 2 different chemical master testing kits, and both show ammonia is 0, so these strips are complete garbage, and not worth the money in the least."
2,not too happy,I place an order for test strip ammonia and 6 in strip for my aquarium. I olny received the ammonia test strip . I would like to know where the rest of my order is.thank u anita singh
2,Complete and utter over-hype,"while the graphics are good and hd output is detailed, in no way do the shipping games take advantage of the expensive technology in this console. They probably won't for another year or so. It also does not play many of the older PS games as Sony had originally promised. It is way overpriced for technology that does not increase the gameplay and fun.Then the console itself is a hunk of swooping black glossy plastic and placing it in your living room make you look like a dork with questionable taste.If you want a truly innovative approach to games get the Wii. Or for the same price as this doorstopper get the Wii and a Xbox360, so you can both have family-friendly innovation and cutting edge games for adults."
2,no upscaler=pleez spare me,now you have to upgrade your tv too...i wished sony made this know first..no scaler chip so no updates! lol
3,Why is Sony spending money to advertise?,"For the company that has dominated the industry since PS1, Sony has really screwed up on the release. Why are they spending a dime on advertising on TV when they can't even get enough to the market to satisfy the word-of-mouth and Internet-news demand? Schmucks...Other than that, the system looks great, and the less noise and heat factor alone almost make it worth more than the 360."
3,gotta be a sony/ps lover,"for the price, lack of game selections and sparse network service, ps3 looks like another over-hyped piece of machine by sony. the game demos downloaded from the network played on 1080p monitor/tv look nice. however, the games don't look to be made using ps3's full potential in terms of details. another minor issue with the machine is loading time. it takes a long time to load games even through the hard drive. i would tell you to wait a year before jumping into the sony's next-gen, but then it won't be next-gen by then."
2,Initial problems with our set,"Hi,I purchased the PS3 two weeks after the release from local retailer. We have two problems with ours. #1. The HDMI port on the PS3 is defective. Nothing from this port at all so we had to search for the alternate HD cables. For the money, Sony should have given the cables with the set.#2. The unit runs very hot. We've heard that you can fry it by running it a long time. We have it elevated and well vented so we'll wait and see. After the holidays ours is going back.We have Madden 07 and now that we have the HD set up, it looks and plays great. My kids are very happy with the wireless controllers."
2,I guess I have too much of a LIFE,"We bought this because we wanted a Blu-ray DVD player and since this is $500 (as opposed to $900 for a Blu-ray player), and plays the Blu-ray, we went for it.We've bought 3 PS3 games that didn't work wothout additional accessories...Long story short--go buy another $300 bucks in cables, wires and cords to get it to work right...then the games are $60 bucks a pop...we would of been better off spending the cash on the Blu-ray DVD player in the first place!"
1,"Awful price point, huge device","Remember the GI Joe Aircraft carrier from the 1980's? Well the PS3 is the 2000's version.. over priced and huge in size. Not much going on here other than a cheap next gen DVD player that may at this point become the Beta tape version of its generation.Save your money, buy an Xbox360 or Wii. Buy both and save money over buying 1 PS3."
1,"ORDER WAS CANCELLED, TITLE NON-EXISTENT","I ordered this product, and the order was cancelled. Not exactly what I would consider acceptable customer service."
1,Sony/Microsoft/NIntendo Class Action Lawsuit,The big 3 should be sued for not making a sufficient supply available before release
2,IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"why buy a [...] from sony when you can buy a WII! its a new system right? sony must be a idot tsame old controler, same old sit in front of the T.v. and press buttons!!!! The grapics are cool. but the SYSTEM! ####!"
5,Sweet,Ps3 is the best console out there.Xbox 360 is good.wii sucks and it's pretty boring after a while.so buy s ps3 or a xbox 360 and you will be happy but not the wii you will regret it after a while(that happened to me).
3,A good overview but the original material is much better,"Although I agree with Dr. Laura in her position on parenthood, I thought the book was weakly written. I have been reading a lot of the source material for her book, books such as ""The Assault on Parenthood"" by Dana Mack, ""Domestic Tranquility"" by F. Carolyn Graglia, etc. and they not only provide in-depth analysis but are much better written books. This book serves as a good introduction to the subject of current family issues and indentifies the leading commentators on the subject. The book is a quick read, but do yourself a favor and seek out the original texts that she quotes in her book. It will be well worth the effort."
3,Writing by Proxy,"Dr. Laura gets a lot of supplemental material for this book from a variety of resources (magazine articles, psychological studies, news accounts, etc.) and so the book can be difficult to get through as you switch from her straight-talking (writing) style to the styles of so many others. However, I do agree with her message and would recommend it for anyone with a family."
1,"Negative, Negative, Negative","Tone is terrible, information is poorly organized and repetitive.I had great anticipation for advice on positive attibutes and practices of good parents, but disappointment continued as she offered only gloom and doom news articles, quotes from worthless TV hosts, etc.Purchase 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families, Stephen R. Covey, an excellent alternative!"
1,Umm... I don't get it,"I don't get it. Why the venom about same-sex parenting? I personally was raised by two wonderful women who were ""their kids moms"" and I am a healthy, happy, well-adjusted, successful woman. I own my own home, am married to a wonderful man, and am planning on having my own child soon. Why does everyone think that lesbians and/or gays can't raise good children? It's simply not true! My moms were better parents than 99% of the straight parents out there! I defy Dr. Laura to do a study that proves that children raised in same-sex households are any worse off than their counterparts. I 100% promise that she would find some very surprising answers. My house was filled with love, and I am a happy, productive adult. It is funny to see someone talking about something they have absoultely no experience with and know absolutely nothing about!"
5,I agreed with everything she was saying about parenthood,"I do believe we need to do more for our children and parents, especially for the mothers. This book talks about the importance of having a dad in a child's life, stupid reasons why to have kids and why we need to be there for our children and raise them also. I also agree with her that a child needs both parents, a mom and a dad."
3,Her case is weakened by poor research,"I was disappointed that Dr. Laura didn't cite much (any?) solid research to back up her views. Her ""references"" are newpaper articles and other sources in the popular media. She attacks views she disagrees with as being backed up with sloppy research done by people with a specific agenda to push, but she uses the same kinds of arguments to support her views. Furthermore, I was stunned to see that she advocates hitting children (spanking) as an important and effective form of discipline. If you're looking for a book in defence of stay-at-home parents, I suggest Being There by Isabelle Fox instead."
3,Best veiwed as a guideline for would-be parents,"The best use this book can be put to is as a guideline/cautionary tale for childless people contemplating parenthood in an era where the workplace is becoming indistinguishable from home, and often preferable to it. I am not going to dispute the virtues of full-time parenting by those who do it well, and have the luxury to choose it. But many people do not have a choice, and to summarily condemn everyone who does not emulate June Cleaver is arrogant and self-serving (two adjectives that unfailingly describe Dr. L.). Families with two employed parents can make it work very nicely at home if they really try, instead of throwing $$ at every problem."
1,"I gave it a chance, but found her advice unconstructive","In an honest effort to find good guides on parenting, I took a look at this title and ultimately came away disgusted. Not so much with her advice--in many ways Dr. Schlessinger's advice is quite good. But her tone is often insulting and the way she makes fun of people who have made bad decisions is unconstructive. I would rather not improve my sense of parenting by gloating over the terrible mistakes of others--rather, I'd like to learn from them. On an aside, Schlessinger's writing does seem to be a bit out of synch with advice I've found in other resources, and upon further investigation I discovered she isn't a psychologist at all but a physiologist. That explains a lot really: this is a sensationalistic book born of her sometimes-cruel radio persona, not a book born of a thoughtful and well-informed background in self-help and psychology. My advice is to forgo this book and rely on other, better-informed self-help guides."
2,One Long Whine,"I have been an at-home (feminist) mom for all the years I have been a mother. I think there is great value in being at home, and I am enjoying this season of my life tremendously. This book, however, doesn't say anything at all new. To be sure, Dr Laura does have the anger/whine thing down really well. If you are a hard-working parent trying to make ends meet, reading this will make you feel pretty awful--like a dog whose master just found the pee on her rug. There must be selfish people dropping their kids off in day care, but all the men and women I know who use day care are thoughtful, loving parents. If you want to be castigated for trying to manage home/work, by all means, read this book. If you want to read something that takes into account a complicated world, where most women aren't lucky/talented enough to make big money hosting their own radio show (where you only need to show up during the hours the kids are in school), I advise a great big pass."
1,Faulty Assumptions,"While Dr. Laura does have some good thoughts in her book i.e. discipline in the home, spending time with our children, she also makes very faulty assumptions throughout the book. Especially in her section on childcare, she makes these very broad assumtpions. The reader is led to believe that all children in day care are raised by the day care. What if a child stays in daycare ten hours a week? Does that mean they are being raised there? What about a child that is there only 20 hours a week? Surely a child is not raised in that time. I find Dr. Laura's tone to be very offensive and her black and white assumptions to be ones that are hurtful and inaccurate."
3,A shrill voice of reason,"I really wanted to like this book. And, to be fair, I agree with most of the conclusions. However, Laura Schlessinger has the bad luck to blend the acerbic style of Ann Robinson (""The weakest link"") into a subject that requires the most compassionate understanding of one of life's greatest emotional challenges, i.e., child rearing. There is too much lecturing, off-the-cuff examples of obviously bad and irrational parenting, and simple overkill. The good news and important lessons are lost in the rhetoric. The world certainly needs better parents and families. More traditional methods of family formation and parenting have grown out of fashion and need a clear, fresh, positive re-examination. As much as its needed, I doubt this book will become the manual for many of those (prospective) parents."
1,does she practice what she preaches?,It seems to me Dr. Laura is and was a working mother... go figure.
2,doctorate in physiology,"dr laura has a phd in physiology, but also spent 20 years as a marriage and family counselor. that may not make her any more qualified than a friend to give advice, but it probably means she knows a thing or two about families.i'll be finishing the book today. It is certainly a quick read. I'm interested in her evidence on parenting, because i maintain a website warning mothers about the harm to their infants from too early separation from mom. i doubt the ""reviewer"" above has read the book yet."
1,OOOGBLECH!,"Do we really need another Dr. Laura book? Where this preachy hypocrite finds the gall to tell others how to live and raise their children is beyond me. Yet another example of a narrow minded person who is convinced that her ""morals"" are the only ones around. Do your kids a favor and skip this hatefest."
1,Sad,"The reality and life as Dr. Laura wants it are two different things. Her reasoning is confused and conclusions are faulty. If your kids are in daycare, they are still your kids and you will be responsible for their actions, not their caregivers.Her mean spirited and shrill complaining is mostly preaching to the choir. I don't think anyone should write a parent book until their kids are 25.Finally, the book will make some pat themselves on the back, while others will turn away in disgust."
3,Dissapointed,"Bought LL550C 50 along with Reliance LL550P 50, unable to connect until i filed the Prongson the male plug (LL550P 50)."
3,"ferry, stick to djing","yes, there are some good songs: Rock your body rock, right of way, its time, but this album is not worth the price. This production is not all that good, okay, but not good. Ferry, stick to djing. Your mixed live in LA is very good. Anyone who doenst know this artist buy that album or global trancemission 02. You will not be disappointed with that. Ferry, again, dont produce. The only dj ive know to pull off half way decent songs that got playtime is tiesto and some of van buurens work."
3,Wrong Way,"I was very excited to get this CD after seeing various great reviews here, but when I got the CD, I was sorely dissapointed. Ferry should stick to his melodic synthesized trance that I'm use to hearing at parties. I don't like it when an DJ, whose known for their particular styles decides to use a CD as a forum for artistic expression. Come one dude! We buy your CD's cause we like your track selections and mixing, not because we care about your attempts at being groundbreaking and try new stuff on your tracks at the expense of having other good tracks. The tracks with the girl vocals are painful and belong in a 90's slow dance compiliation. The best track is probably Kyoto. The Rock Baby Rock track is a wannabe pop rip off....Let's get with the program Ferry!"
5,Great for arthropod lovers!,"We can't get enough of these habitats! They are so convenient! We usually have three on hand, with one always in the minivan. They work so well because they fold down and go in a storage bag when not in use so that they can be stored almost anywhere very easily. They give whatever is in them a nice airy environment, and the white mesh and clear top make for pretty unobstructed viewing. The only drawback is that the mesh, as can be expected, is not the sturdiest of materials and can be ripped. We have taped a couple of small tears back together, but they do eventually become beyond repair. However, for the price and the fun, good use that is gotten from them, they are a great buy."
3,Insect Lore Pop-Up Port-A-Bug,The Insect Lore Pop-Up Port-A-Bugwas smaller then I though it would be.It worked OK though for one caterpiler.Thank you
3,homeschoolmom,I have purchased these habitats in the past. This pop up was a bit smaller for the price and it does not stay closed like the pop up's I purchased in the past so you will have to use the bag to contain it. These are great for putting little insects into and observing. I would not recommend for caterpillars because they can be easy mushed in the zippered area of the bag.
1,v,"This came and was way too small. Doesn't hold much, and can't support weight if you hang it. Don't recommend."
3,Smaller Than Imagined,"Overall this is a good product.We were surprised by how tiny it was. We previously owned a butterfly pavilion (which looks identical) so expected this product to be similarly sized.When we opened the package we laughed hysterically at the ""little shot glass sized"" item.The product comes in a cute (but worthless) little pouch with a belt clip. We would suggest nuking the bag and attaching the same clip to the product iteslf. This would allow little ""hunters"" to have 2 free hands during the hunt."
3,Not what I expected,"I ordered this to hatch out preying mantis eggs in. It is made well, and pretty resilient. The whole thing collapses down and fits in a little pouch that it comes with. The only problem that I had was this it is smaller than I expected. For what it cost, I was expecting it to be a bit wider and easier to get into."
4,This Is Another Greatest Hits Album,"This is a pretty good cd. The only thing I don't like about it is the song ""We Two"" is a totally different version from what I've heard before and I don't like it. The rest of the songs are ok. Has a few hard to find songs, like ""Piece Of The Dream and St. Louis""."
1,"Actually, most of the 1st nine have been released","""Marcie"" and ""Night in the City"" were released on an Ashley Hutchings compilation. Hard to find cuts poorly recorded. Great performances though.The only one I've never heard before is ""Both Sides Now"" with Judy Dyble on lead vocals.The 3 Joni Mitchell cuts are the only rare ones. All of the rest are readily available elsewhere. Most of this is just recycled tracks from the Cropedy 3 disc set.Very bizarre compilation. Don't understand it at all.Wish there was an easier way to get the 3 Joni Mitchell covers!"
2,"Thanks, but no thanks!","This is one of the few Fairport Convention albums of the last three decades which disappoints. It consists of alternate recordings of old favorites, nearly all of which were done better the first time. It is particularly disappointing to hear Sandy Denny's solos done by a less competent vocalist. My advice: stick to the original recordings like Leige and Lief and Full House--they are Fairport at their best!"
1,"Book looks great, but faulty DVD-ROMs and lousy service","If I ever get working copies of the two DVD-ROMs included with this book, I look forward to actually starting to use it and giving a better rating. But so far, it has taken weeks of emails to receive ONE of the two replacement discs, with no explanation or indication of whether I will be receiving the other one. Apparently there is occasionally a bad batch of discs, so check as soon as you get yours that all the files copy across to your computer correctly."
1,Difficult,"Hard to understand. It is nowhere ""selftaught' whatsoever. U will need a teacher for thisThere is no way you are going to learn this on your own. I found out the hard way"
5,Great Book,This is a must read for anyone interested in raves.Michael Brianson's review below is WAY off base.Buy this book.
4,ravers and non-ravers will be interested,"Both ravers and non-ravers will find much of interest in this comprehensive, informative and entertaining look at the rave scene."
2,just more pap.....,"one more book pushing old quotes and usless info about a dying dope scene. if you are looking for an educated veiw of this scene you won't find it in this book. it could also use another edit to help with the flow and grammer, but next to that it does not present anything new or truly useful."
4,High quality Stoki,"I had this arrangement when it was available on Decca/London. I did not enjoy his Shostakovich Symphony No. 5 as much here as the version Stoki produced on Everest but many others did. A lot of critics called this version more impassioned and with deeper attachment that the seemingly more laid back Everest production.This is a concert reading of Stoki's rewrite of ""Pictures At An Exhibition"" which excludes a number of the pictures and takes a more Russian view of the score than Ravel's more international approach. By Russian I mean Stoki uses more low strings and woodwinds to make paint the portraits.All told, this is the old wizard in concert doing a pair of cornerstones of Russian music. If you've never heard this one it will give you an idea why any Stokowski performance can be such a revelation."
4,The Search for Bridey Murphy,"A provocative account by Morey Bernstein of his hypnosis of Virginia Tighe and her regression to childhood, infancy and--unexpectedly--into a previous life. Tighe (referred to as Ruth Simmons in the book) recounts a life as Birdey Muphey in a previous century in Ireland; and while research could not verify Bridey's life or death, Tighe' s Irish brogue while under hynosis, and the places and events that were later verified, make for fasinating reading and begs the question: Does the soul survive to live after death?"
3,"Interesting book, but the real story is a letdown.","This is a really compelling book that started a huge craze of interest in reincarnation in the U.S. in the 1950's. Though this was not revelaed until after the book was published, it's really too bad that Bridey Murphy turned out to be Bridey Murphy Corkell, an Irish woman who lived across the street from the house that Virginia Tighe grew up in, and Virginia's recollections were childhood memories of Mrs. Corkell's stories told to her as a litle girl. It just goes to show how desperate we all are to believe that there is ""something out there."" 'Tis a pity, but it was all showmanship - smoke and mirrors."
2,"No, it really is bunk","Actually, the reviewer below seems to be misinformed about the reviewer below him/her being misinformed, unless he/she has access to some credible but obscure source (which should certainly be named if it exists, since the closest thing I've been able to find to a refutation of the contra Bridey Murphy argument is some X Files slash fiction.Sure, the paper that came up with the damaging claims against the case was a rival of the paper that popularized it: does that prove that they were wrong? Remember Occam's Razor."
1,Utter Disappointment,"Total absence of theory. Algorithms very poorly documented. However, it does open the eyes to the available algorithms in image processing. If you want to know how they really work, look elsewhere. At > $30, this book is an utter dissaapointment. At $3., it would have earned 4 stars. The least the authors could do is publish a CD to go along."
3,Different,"Funny, I bought this album for one thing the song Chinese Wall but, I have a friend to like his music so it was a good gift to him."
3,He misses his mark on this one,Philip Baily has a awesome voice for the right songs but only ones that were awesome is one written by Phil Collins & one after that.The rest of the songs were just so so.I believe on his next cd if he makes another without E.W.F. it could be awesome with Phil Collins & him writing together on a whole cd.
1,unrealistic and silly,Mary Jane from the block kmeeping up with Green Berets? Yeah right. Hollywood shows itself detached from all reality!This is just more propaganda by people who've never served in the military to push for women in combat roles- a singularly bad idea.Matt Dedinas3rd Infantry Division (1996-1999)
3,so-so,i just didnt think this book was that good. Some of the chapters were too long and detailed; I also didnt believe the ending; showing up to a wedding? random.
3,Boring,"Its boring, even if the subject itself is not. Most of the students in the class, including myself were frustrated with the layout. This is important because when you are trying to memorize charts and things, a good layout makes it a lot easier. Felt like giving up at times."
2,Deeply flawed but with flashes of genius,"Kate Bush is a phenomenal songwriter and musician but overreaches here with a rather pretentious attempt at directing what is really little more than a colection of six music videos from the Red Shoes album. Trying too hard, Kate looks tired and out of her depth in a series of rather risible scenes which rather obviously ape Michael Powell's style. It is a pity that Kate did not limit herself to what she does best and bring in an experienced director. But here it is, complete with self-congratulatory credits and lamentable design, ham acting and cliched photography. Kate Bush fans will love it (but they are hardly an objective bunch) while it is hard to imagine anyone else taking it seriously. What a sad waste of resources."
1,Yawn. Wake me up when it's over,"You remember Kate Bush? She was the stunning 19 year old who made a hit debut single 'Wuthering Heights' and then never really lived up to the promise. Now she makes a new album about every seven years (maybe) and fills in the time by pretending to be a film director. This is a pretty awful piece of work which has one or two hummable (but forgettable) tunes and not much else. Kate's slightly loopy fans (see the postings below for examples) will think that this promo video masquerading as a movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but that doesn't say much. Curiosity value only."
1,Ridiculously poorly indexed; writing's not much better,"This is one of those amalgamated code books that seems to have been put together for no other reason than to enrich the authors. It is not comprehensive, it provides no insights into best practices, and, worst of all, it can't even be used as an effective reference because of the really astoundingly bad index. Look at the Bill Vaughn book for something really worth reading."
2,Average,"I'm an experianced programming who was looking for a book with lots of technical depth on ADO. Whilst there are some good chapters in this book, generally the topics covered are not examined in detail, mainly because the coverage is too broad (eg. covers ADSI, Exchange etc etc). Everytime I use this book I find myself having to search MSDN to really get the details I need. aarrgghh!"
2,Nicely written but dated.,"As the previous reader wrote, this book is a homage to Robert E. Lee which exactly don't make it a very good biography if the author was too much in love with his subject. Certain sense of objectivity goes out the window. It doesn't helped that the author proves to be rather pro-southern in outlook which heavily tainted his approach. The book read very well though but much of the author's work sounds very dated compared to the newer works on Lee - that reduced Lee into something more human. I think authors like Clifford Dowdey seem to be outdated as the Civil War moves into a more objective outlook."
2,Could be better,Worked OK for a couple of weeks until the plastic tabs that grip the belt lost their strength. I would not buy this again or recommend it.
5,Very happy with these,Thesedo the job well and I don't have to sew my pants to make it happen. Holds up my gun belt well.
3,Bought this album for one song,"Bought this album for one song,,, kinda wish I would have checked out the rest of the tracks before making the purchase"
4,"An excellent, straight ahead jazz recording.","Steve Kuhn has made another fine CD of straight-ahead jazz. An excellent CD of jazz piano trio music. On a scale of one to ten, it is a nine. You will not be disappointed."
2,Nothing new here.,"A fairly comprehensive recitation of literature in the field, but lacking in original voice and too politically correct for my tastes. Would make a good college text if paired with a dissenting voice for a more balanced presentation."
3,Interesting and Informative,"I found this book easy to read and even though I thought some of it's idea's a bit out dated, it was a very interesting insite to gender developement."
2,Nothing new here.,"A fairly comprehensive recitation of existing literature in the field, but lacking in original voice, and too politically correct for my tastes. Would make a good college text if paired with a dissenting voice for a more balanced presentation."
2,ripoff,"this is one expensive cd to be as weak as it is. i was a dj during andy's earlier steed career so i got to hear all the singles that were released whether they sold or not. baby how'd we ever get this way. rainbow ride, tricia tell your daddy, and a rocking number that was big in memphis where i worked, it's your life are all absent here. yeah, be my baby, and baby i love you and baby how'd we ever get this way are nice, but this ain't no greatest hits--frankly, if i never hear rock me gently again it will be too soon. where the ... is rhino when you need them. i guarantee you there is an audience out there for a real greatest hits."
3,"""Greatest Hits"" - almost","As has been mentioned earlier, I also find the term ""Greatest Hits"" in this context slightly deceptive, since there are only 5 of his 14 U.S. chart singles on this CD, and his very first Top-40 hit, ""How'd We Ever Get This Way,"" was omitted. I suppose licensing rights may play a part, but until a more comprehensive ""Best of Andy Kim"" CD arrives, this CD is worth having. It's also worth noting that EMI in Canada (Kim's native country) or the U.S. did not release this particular compilation...A great addition on his next ""Best Of"" CD would be not just his other Steed charters - like the excellent 'bubbling under' single ""Tricia Tell Your Daddy"" - but also his only charted single for Uni (MCA), ""Who Has The Answers?"" (charted #111 in 1972). Some of his 1980s material when he was known as Baron Longfellow would be splendid to add, too...Until then, we can always listen to his Greatest Hits vinyl LP on Steed (or ABC), plus the fine selections on this compact disc."
3,"""Greatest Hits"" ?","It's great seeing Andy Kim on CD, but I find the title of the CD very disappointing and deceptive. I have good junior-high school memories of ""Rainbow Ride"", ""So Good Together""... I thought ""How'd We Ever Get This Way"" and ""Tricia Tell Your Daddy"" were hits too. I guess I'll continue listening to my vinyl from ABC/Dunhill."
2,Missing key elements in Kim's discography...,"A good collection of hits -- but for the price, why aren't they all there? In particular, what about ""Rainbow Ride"" and ""I Wish I Were""? The former, a great psychedelic pop song, the latter probably the best ballad Kim ever did. Why buy a ""best of"" if it isn't?"
2,Poor quality,My last one was excellent and lasted ten years. This one fell apart after wearing it just five times and the side support would always slip out. Very unimpressive.
4,A Well-Built Knee Brace,"This is a good quality knee brace. I have torn ligaments in my right knee from my basketball playing days, and I've been using it for workouts with my personal trainer to absorb some of the pounding that affects my knee. It supports my knee pretty well. The only down side is that I wished I would've ordered a smaller size. I measured my knee prior to ordering, and according to this company's size chart, I needed to order an XXX Large. However, when I tried it on, it was a bit too large. I didn't return it for a smaller size because I read other reviewers describe their difficulties working with this company to get exchanges and/or refunds. For now, I just tighten the straps really well and that seems to do the trick."
2,"Helps, but no more than a $10 one","I used to wear a $10 one that I bought from Walmart. But I wanted something that gives me more support and comfort. I decided on this product primarily due to the good reviews. Based on manufacturer's web site, I found that my size is right between medium and large. I ordered a pair of large first to be on the safe side. But oversizing is not a good thing. Even if you can strap down the top and bottom, the middle portion is still too loose to provide adequate support. I returned it back to the 3rd party seller for exchange ($5 fee). The medium size fits snug on top and bottom without strapping down. The knee portion is tight enough provide a good level of support, though I do not feel any improvement to what I used to have. On top of that, this product is heavier, harder to put it on and off, and can get very warm and sweaty in the summer. Had I known what I know, I would have saved the money for the upgrade."
2,very unhappy,"The company sent the wrong color for starters. The brace was so big that, even wearing it over my pants, it slid down. I called the company about the problem and they refused to even listen. So now I am out nearly $60 for a product I can't use because it is too big. Even if I'd not worn it they said they would not take it back. I think this is most unfair. I will never deal with them again."
3,"Not the best brace I've ever had, but not bad for the money","The brace is a little loose for the size (all my braces are the same size and this is by far the loosest of the 4, so take that for what it's worth). If I wear it over one of those ACE compression sleeve braces it fits perfectly, so that's not really a giant issue. Just an annoyance. What is driving me insane though is the constant squeaking. It squeaks every single time I bend my knee, and we're not talking little squeaks. But considering it was half the price of my other braces, I don't know that I can complain that much. I only use this one for wearing around the house anyway on days my knee is acting up.Having said that, it gives decent support and it's pretty comfortable to wear even if it is larger than it should be for the size."
3,Perhaps the standards were too high...,"Starting in early May, late April, Sr-71's first single ""Right Now"" hit the radio station which I frequently listen to. It was perhaps one of the best songs that I had heard lately, seeing as how I am a huge Blink 182/Goldinger/punk fan. It was (and still is) a fine piece of punk. Then, on June 21, after weeks of waiting, I purchased the full CD ""Now You See Inside"" at Best Buy. I was confused. What had happened to the Sr-71 that were responsible for ""Right Now""? Almost the entire CD is filled with struggling lyrics, unimpressive hooks, and hardly a trace of punk. But, after listening for a couple of days, I grew used to the fact that it is essentially punk free, and decided it is a decent modern rock album--if only the standards were not set so high."
3,This is a SR-71 cd,"I sold this cd. I don't regret it. It wasn't really a bad cd, and I don't think it was ""misleading"" as others put it. It just wasn't as grandiose as i expected. I mean if someone gave me this cd I keep it, but I only listen to it like every 8 months. It's just sort of dry. I don't really know what that means but its hust lacking something."
1,What is this....?,"I bought this CD thinking it would be Awesome! But I was wrong, It was a bunch of... Nevermind... But don't get this CD it's horrible! Right Now is the only good song on this album, but I don't like it now because it's WAY overplayed on the radio. I found out that SR-71 are a bunch of posers too, trying to be like Blink 182, Sum-41, and Linkin Park and all thoes other bands that Preps love. I despise all of this horrid music. If you want good music check out Pennywise, Offspring, Papa Roach (Their New CD), Nirvana, Adema, and KoRn. Thoes bands are great, but be warned, their not for Preps :)"
1,What is this nonsense,"Oh man i have never heard such blatant noise that has the means to destroy all music. What has this band done. They have one good song and another ok one and then well and then the cd should have just stopped. I would rather shove a pencil in my ear to destract myself from the pain of this cd. If you have it i am sorry, if u dont well then you have not missed a thing!"

2,Enjoy the 15 minutes,"Wow,this cd overrated.It is not nearly as good as everyone claims it is.Ok,it has two or three catchy tunes on first listen.But let's try to listen to them a few more times and tell me it doesn't get old!Pure crappiness at its most marketable.These guys sure do know how to sell out,I'll give 'em that.At least when Blink did it,they still sounded solid.SR-71 is just another band getting some limelight after Blink's success.Right Now is capable of being a Britney tune if you take out the guitars,along with Last Man on the Moon.Although,I have to admit,Fame(What She Wanted)is a huge guilty pleasure which saved this cd from getting a big,fat 1!It's inventive,humorous, and impossible not to hum to.Well,1 out of 11 ain't too bad...NOT!!!Punk fans,don't buy it!"
4,Great music,SR-71 has just outdone themselves this time. I have heard them since their beginnings in Maryland and this cd is great. I love all the songs and am sure you will too.
5,Best new band on the alternative scene,"Powerful thought provoking lyrics accompanied by mood altering guitar tracks. Add in the vocal harmonization and this will quickly become a favorite in your CD collection. Standout tracks include Last Man on the Moon, Non-Toxic Ordinary Day, Politically Correct, and Empty Spaces."
4,They're pretty good....,"Well, I heard the CD at my friends house, and I was quite amazed. I never heard the band before, and I was shocked! The enthusiasm and energy of these guys was at a very high capacity. I couldn't believe it, I actually believe that they could be the next Blink182, or Lit. My friend, of course bought the CD the day it came out, only because he was practically in love with their latest hit, which is also one of my favorite songs. I expect them to have a great success and hopefully their Cd's in the future would be just as good."
4,Good Vibes from a good band,"SR-71 is showing off their music tallents in this soundalike album to Green Day or MxPx, but hey, they're all good."
5,Fantastic Debut!,"SR-71's debut album for RCA, ""Now You See Inside"" is a must buy for fans of alterna-pop music. But unlike much of your standard top 40 fare, SR-71 could also be categorized as a straight out rock album with an edgy quality that works perfectly alongside the group's well-harmonized, instantly catchy melodies. In addition to the current single ""Right Now,"" tracks ""Politically Correct"" and ""Empty Spaces"" are destined to be hits, but every song on this album has the potential to get radio play. Incidentally, the album was produced by Gil Norton, who also produced albums for The Foo Fighters and Counting Crows. Fans of those albums will undoubtedly enjoy this one from SR-71.The group is going on tour this summer with Stroke 9 and Nine Days - an excellent bill all around."
3,Two Words: Let Down,"You should pat yourself on the back for reading these reviews! I didn't and heard a cool song on the radio(Right Now) and bought the cd, hoping for a Blink 182-esque band. It's a waste of money, the first 2 songs are cool, the rest are just craptastic! Unless you are in to the boy-band, slow stuff, look elsewhere, such as MxPx, NoFX, Blink 182, etc."
3,average,"Don't get fooled by all the 4 & 5 stars. Most of them are from people from the band's hometown. This CD is ok. The problem arises right after the first two tracks...right now and politically correct. The rest of the album is awful. Since you can hear Right Now all the time on the radio..and I am sure politically correct soon enough, you may want to reconsider spending the 15 bucks on the album."
1,not what i expected,the single from this cd is great. The rest of the cd is not anywhere near what the single sounds like. Olny buy if if you like soft rock.
4,What's in a name...,"Pop, punk, rock...who cares. I won't bother trying to compare this band to others or figure out what their sound is. This is just good music. I have been looking for something fresh for a while now and this is it. I was fortunate enough to listen to ALL of the tracks before I bought this one so I had no expectations based on just the first few tracks. This is definitely an album that gets better after a few spins. Give it a chance and you'll be playing it over and over."
5,SR-71=GOOD MUSIC,"This is undoubtedly the greatest album to ever exist. Right Now and Politically Correct combine fast-paced rock with amazing lyrics, and form a stark contrast to songs such as Empty Spaces, which uses amazing lyrics and a steady, slow tune. They have soft songs, hard songs, and varying shades in-between."
5,Love It,"SR-71 has great sound and original, beautiful lyrics. On NOW YOU SEE INSIDE they range from heavier topics (What A Mess and Last Man on the Moon) to more fun songs (Fame). Their lyrics are poetic and blend well with the sound of each song, and their instrumental and vocal skills are extaordinary. This is -by far- my favorite CD."
5,perfect pretty muchs sums it up,"I have a cd collection of over 1000 cds, and I have some serious classics, and this album is definetly in my top 10. They are not like all the punk/emo/hardcore bands (which I really like actually) you see everywhere. They are different, better. Catchy tunes, powerful lyrics, simple and yet perfect songs. Writing a song and filling it with wonderful huge solos, makes the song amazing, if you have the skills, you can do it. Making a simple song with simple chords and simple riffs sound as great as sr-71 does, however, that is what I call the work of a genius. And there's Mitch Allan of course. You just don't expect someone that hot to be that talented."
1,What the...................,Ok i had heard the first two tracks just around (right now and politically correct) and i thought the cd would be really bad as$. I finally got to hear the other songs. I was shocked. It wasnt how good the rest of them were it was how bad they are. And tracks one and two sound like a rad band but the rest were pretty much crap. If they put out more stuff like those two then they will make it.
1,Hated it,"The first 2 songs and maybe one other (Last Man on the Moon) are good. The rest is what I would classify as sissy-rock. Yeah, that's right, sissy-rock. If you're a woman or a man with bad taste, this CD is the one for you."
2,Blink Fans Beware!,"I first heard ""Right Now"" while driving on vacation. I really liked it. A few days ago, I was in the local record store and noticed the CD, Now You See Inside. I remembered how much I liked the song and purchased the album. Aside from the first two tracks, the rest of the album sounds more like NSYNC with guitars. Blink 182, NOFX, Goldfinger, etc. fans should beware. This album is decent, but it's hardly comparable to Dude Ranch, Enema of the State, or other albums in this genre. Not all of the songs are fast and upbeat. Again, it is a decent first album for a young band, but it's not quite what I expected after having only heard ""Right Now."""
1,music fan,"When I bought this CD I was expecting a CD which had music on it such as ""Right Now"" the single that SR-71 has on the radio. The first track was also a good tune ""Politically Correct"" and then came ""Right Now"" and I was, at that point expecting a good punkish-pop album. NO. Every single track after that is soft lyrics and music not close to punk or rock stuff. Personally I prefer rock or punk. This is not even close to Eve6 which is also recomended on the page. Some reviewers have called these guys the missing link to the Goo Goo Dolls and N'SYNC or even closer to the Goo Goo Dolls side, what are you guys drinking? This is N'SYNC with instruments except for the first 2 tracks, they are the only reason I am giving this 1 star. If you are looking for rock or punk with more than 2 songs of good music dont get this cd. If you like softer more pop stuff than this is good stuff for that, I'm not saying SR-71 are not good musicians they just dont make my kind of music."
5,SR-71 is supersonic,the band SR-71 lives up to the supersonic jet that they are named after. their music is fast and very high flying. i've heard them live and they are definately headed to the top!
4,Never heard of them before but it's good,"I don't know where this band came from. Out of no where they came out with the single Right Now that's pretty popular in Sac town. Definetly catchy but some songs lack lyrical sense. Songs like Politically Correct, Empty Spaces, Another Night Alone, Fame (sort of), and Right Now don't really have that problem. The only song I can't make sense out of that I enjoy is Last Man on the Moon only because it's catchy and that counts for something. All the other songs are bland and hard to enjoy without listening for awhile but I can't easily listen to this cd when its on random. Go out and get it damn it."
2,2 good songs,"thats it folks, 2 good songs, track 1 and track 2. I had first learned about sr-71 thru their amazing sophmore release ""tomorrow"" and thought I'd give this one a try. Needless to say, I was very unhappy. I'd recommend tomorrow over this one anyday, and if you have a little extra to spend, pick up ""here we go again"", which steps up the pop-punk even further and rivals albums by blink and simple plan. bottom line, THIS ALBUM IS NOT PUNK. Its like boy-band pop meets matchbox 20, if you catch my drift."
3,What a disapointment,"I bought this CD because I liked the song Right Now. I thought this CD was gonna be a copy of Eve6, which is a great band. However, when I bought it I found out the only other good song was an ok song called: Politically Correct. This CD sounds NOTHING like Eve6 other than the song Right Now. The only reason why this is a 3 is because of that song. Which happens to be one of my favourite songs. Don't make the mistake I made. If you like the song Right Now just buy the single and stick to Eve6. I also recommend Blink182, Bad Religion, Pennywise, Green Day and the Punk-o-Rama series."
2,"Okay, but not what I hoped for","When I first heard ""Politically Correct"", I thought this band was an awesome punk/pop rock band. So I got the CD...and I was off by some. ""Politcally Correct"" and ""Right Now"" are by far the best songs on here. The rest of the music on here is kind of a rock ballad type. ""What a Mess"", ""Alive"", and ""Non-Toxic"" are pretty good songs, and the rest suck. In ""Paul McCartney"", whats with them saying ""Things would be so much better if Paul was still alive""? He is still alive! Listening to these songs, it gave me the impression that Mitch Allen and company had great trouble writing these songs, and used a dictionary to find words that rhymed. At the beginning of Right Now, ""She clings to me like cellophane, fake plastic submarine""...what the heck does that mean? Download ""Politcally Correct"" and ""Right Now"" somewhere, don't waste your money on this. The lyrics sound forced, and the words don't sound right."
1,good thing I didn't actually buy it,"I heard it at a friend's house thinking that it was all gonna be kinda pop-punkish like ""Right Now"". I was totally disappointed. The rest of the album is wicked light. I'd say it was N'Syncish, but too many people actually like that group and calling SR-71's album that might actually sell more albums. It was worse than the GooGoo Dolls, and I really don't like their music..."
4,REFRESHING OLD SOUND COMES BACK IN THE FORM OF SR-71.,"SR-71 is a new band with an old twist. It brings back that 80s new wave sound with a rock twist.With inventive lyrics and sounds this band is on its way to hitting the big time.Great songs include the first single ""Right Now"", ""Non-Toxic"" and ""Empty Spaces"". A very refreshing album that plays good throughout.A definite thumbs up!"
4,Very Good- Very Surprising,"This is a very good cd. However, the whole cd is not like Right Now. Right Now is by far the best song on this cd, with Politically Correct and Paul McCartney also earning good reviews. Politically Correct and Right Now, the 1st and 2nd song on the cd, are peppy. The rest of the cd is kind of mellow. But a good mellow. All songs have a catchy chorus, but are kind of mellow. Some of the lyrics are a bit strange, take for instance:""I'm one of those things you'll save forever, but never need like an old newspaper no one has time to read."" But, this is a fantastic cd, strange lyrics or not, and i do recommend getting it. However, if you're expecting a cd full of songs like Right Now, you'll be dissapointed."
4,the best punks i've heard for a while!,"sr-71 are a very strong band because of two factors, one the songwriting is strong, two the songs are varied, some fast,some slow, some loud, and some soft.1.pollicially correct: great opening track,fast and ultra catchy.2.right now: best track on album, fast, amsome guitar riff3.what a mess: slower, murky,but very catchy4.last man on the moon: upbeat, great chorus5. empty spaces: great pop song,sweet and sour thing going on here.6.another night alone: one of the best,loud7.alive, good, but not the best8.fame, very popy, bit too popy for me9.go away, good tune,good verse guitar riff10. non-toxic: very upbeat, catchy, good vocals11. paul mccartney: slow but still good.buy this if you like, sugarcult,blink 182,lit,less than jake, american hi-fi."
2,SR-71,Sure Right Now is a good song but the rest of the album is to soft. I bought this cd right off the bat and I was dissapointed. I don't think they're anything like Blink 182 or Fenix tx SR-71 is a lot worse and I would know I have Blink 182 and Fenix tx.
3,disappointing to punk fans,"I'll have to agree with Dave from New Jersey. It's a good CD, but it's not punk. I went to the music store looking for a good CD to buy and previewed the first two songs on SR-71. Hearing ""Politically Correct"" and ""Right Now"" I thought to myself ""If the first two songs on this CD is so rad and kinda punk-popish, then the rest of it can't be so bad, either."" So I bought it. After ""Right Now"" it gets a bit slower. Don't get me wrong, tracks 3-11 are great songs but I was expecting more similar songs to the first two. If you're a Blink-182/Fenix*TX fan, and you enjoy ""Right Now"", I suggest you stick to recording the song off your radio. But if you're the type of person who listens to a little bit of everything, this CD'll be great. I'm a punk-pop person, but ""Now You See Inside"" grew on me, so it might just do the same for you."
2,One long excruciating non-stop depiction of horror,"This is a non-stop narrative, just one chapter, no breaks. Semprun never learned the name of his companion on the box-car ride, so he simply calls him ""the guy from Semur."" Sadly, the guy never got out of the box car. Semprun survived the box car and spent more than two years in Buchenwald, which he hardly describes.But Semprun achieves literary stardom in his depiction of the S.S. murder of 15 Jewish children who somehow survived the voyage of horror -- without food or drink.There is just one flaw. The gate of Buchenwald did not say ""Arbeit macht frei!"" It quoted Shakespeare: ""To Each His Own."" (""Jedem das Seine."")"
4,VERY NICE - TOUGH,"PERFECT FOR 10"" STAINLESS STEEL GAZING BALL. THE PRODUCT IS POWDER COATED, AND HOPEFULLY WILL NOT RUST FOR MANY YEARS. I REALLY LIKE THE SINGLE POST - EASY TO DRIVE AND VERY NICE LOOKING DESIGN."
1,hey nekroman! get your head out of yer butt!!!,"this album is to be avoided at all costs. in fact this band is about the gayest thing around. kim nekroman proves once again that married old rock n roll guys let their wives destroy them. instead of working even harder to make nekromantix a household word he hits the road with a bunch of psycho-douches. ""hey lets try to get ""psychobilly"" on the radio! i have seen these losers live and it was worse than the records. miss day cant play her standup bass half as good as lee rockers left nut. if you own this your either a fashionable girl or an idiot. say hell no! and look elswhere."
4,Hope I don't get sick of it...,"I've been listening to this album for a couple of days now and I'm really digging it. Its bouncy and fun. There's enough variation in the tracks so that they don't all sound the same and the energy is good. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it is so catchy and so ""pop"" that I'm afraid I'll get burned out on it. I'm not sure why some people wrote that they liked the first half of the album but not the second half. ""Dotted With Hearts"" has a great sound, like listening to music from ""Grease"" with power. The surf sound of ""Horrorbeach"" is cool and ""Emotional Abuse"" is really sultry. Well, everyone is different. I'd recommend this album. I've sent copies to a couple other people already."
1,Radio Pop,"This definitely isnt psychobilly. More like rockabilly influenced pop music. In fact, Id say this is the record No Doubt wouldve made if they got into that scene instead of ""ska"".still, it has catchy songs if youre into that. Im not... the songs stick in my head and drive me crazy."
5,Totally B!tch!n',"This album is awesome! The problem is with many people who buy it expecting to hear psychobilly. This is a side project w/ members of other psychobilly bands. This is supposed to be a mix of new wave, punk, and just good old fashioned rock n' roll and it delivers everything that Kim Nekroman (guitarist) promises. All the tracks are great, especially the surf rock-esk track Horror Beach.If you like The Nekromantix you'll like this album. If you like Blondie... you'll like this album. If you like any punk, rockabilly, or psychobilly get this CD.Contrary to popular sceptism, there are no links between Patricia's attitude and Gwen's attitude from No Doubt. I've heard No Doubt, and I've heard the HorrorPops and I can honestly say that people who claim there is a likeness in attitude are just plain wrong. Patricia has a style all unto her own."
3,I dunno.,"I basically agree with what many others have said. I like their sound, and they certainly have potential, but only half of this cd is good. Tracks 1-6 are great, and from then on it's absolutely terrible. Especially Kool Flattop.It's still an alright cd, though. The Horrorpops have a very unique sound that can appeal to many different types of people."
3,Pretty Rad.,"I have mixed feelings about this album... to put it simply, I love tracks 1 through 6 and strongly dislike tracks 7 through 13. The obvious best song is Where They Wander, and, well... then there's Kool Flattop.They do, however, have a very original sound. I really don't understand why there is so much comparison between Patricia and Gwen Stefani. I am a huge fan of No Doubt and just can't hear a similarity. If anything, I'd say she sounds more like Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo. All the vocals and instrumentals are of bitchin' quality.This is a fun, high-energy album with a unique mixture of sounds. There is something on it for a fan of pretty much any genre, and I'd recommend it to everyone."
1,Sooooo Booooored,"I bought Bring It On a few months back, and I absolutely love it! So, I decided to buy Hell Yeah based on that. I was so disappointed! This CD is just plain boring. There is little variation between songs, and it feels like the lead singer didn't change her tone, pitch or inflection throughout the entire album. Especially disappointing is Psychobitches Outta Hell, since if they had put any effort into making it a good song instead of just a song, it could have served as an anthem to an entire demographic of chicks (like me). So much potential was wasted with this CD. I would advise people to just buy Bring It On, and leave this one alone."
3,Just Okay...,"It is a well built mailbox overall, however, the locking mechanism did not work when I put it together. Yes, you have to assemble this. I basically had to rebuild the mechanism. If you are not mechanically inclined - do not attempt this mailbox - that is, if you want it to lock. It is designed so that everything must work precisely, but the parts are not made so precisely. I had to put a large plastic washer on the flag since it scraped against the box and was removing the paint. The paint job is very good and the box itself is strong."
2,3-Ring NFL Card Binder,"Purchased for a B-day gift. When I received it packaging was in great condition. The 3-Ring binder cover was split at the seams and it had a layer of dust on it like it was pulled out of an attic. Clearly this should have been noticed before shipping out. Now I have to go find another with limited time. In my opinion, this should have been caught and prevented."
3,Okay,"This binder suits its purpose, but it did arrive in not so good shape. There were smudges and streaks on the binder and it looked used. Not what I expected when I purchased new."
2,its an ok disc,"I've had this CD for years and pop it in occasionally. Its a pretty diverse compilation of some rather interesting stuff...more hard edged old school techno. Not particularly sophisticated, hard edged and up tempo. Its not one of of my faves..."
1,what a waste,What a waste of money. The CD is misleading... It was produced over 10 years ago and doesn't sound good at all.
1,WHERE'S BUD?,"This is not a CD for Bud Freeman fans, or even tradtional jazz fans. These recordings are merely popular numbers recorded for the public and you can hardly hear Freeman's sax. The five DeMarco sisters sing on some of these! I want my money back."
4,"Buy it for the Bonus DVD, not the biopic.","The biopic isn't very exciting, maybe even a little embarrassing, but I noticed that much of the dialog is taken from Meredith Daneman's very good biography of Fonteyn. If you read it and Julie Kavanagh's biography of Rudolf, you will know as much as there is to know about these iconic dancers, personally and professionally. I actually read both of those books twice because Kavanagh's led me to Daneman's, and that made me want to read the Rudolf bio again, etc. Time well spent, too.The best part of this pair of DVD's is the bonus disk featuring Fonteyn in segments from three ballets. My favorite is Ondine. For a terrific review of the ballets on the bonus disk, I recommend Ivy Lin's review. In fact, read all her ballet DVD reviews, you can learn a lot from them and be guided to some other DVD's you might like to add to your collection. Expert information."
2,Mixed Feelings,"First off let me start by saying that the extra dvd is fabulous and is worth the purchase for that. There are some lovely performances from Margot in it that are a must see. That being said the movie itself is cr*p! Horrible movie, inaccurate in conjunction to previous biographies, gratuitous sex scenes that make her look like a tart, poor acting, little to no dancing and I was literally embarassed to be watching it with my mother in law. In the end I threw away the movie and kept the extra dvd."
5,An excellent guide,"This book is a must for everyone that wants to know, go or went to Rome. I enjoyed it so much!"
4,Pretty cool.,"This sounds like industrial Motley Crue, honestly. If you're going at this expecting something super thought provoking, you're not only barking up the wrong tree, you're in the wrong forest. However, if you're looking for some cool electronic beats, flashy guitar, and solid vocals to have some fun to, you'll like this. It's the kind of album you'd drink beer and hang out with strippers to. It's some solid ""don't think too hard"" fun. Skold went on to KMFDM (I think, I don't like them), and Marilyn Manson (the album he did with them is not my favorite of theirs by a long shot). I'll be honest, I got this in a bargain bin, and I dig it. It is what it is, and they're good at what they do. Just don't think about it too hard."
2,Somewhat atonal metal,"This disc is a radical change from previous work. The singer has changed, and the music has lapsed into ""industrial"" metal, which is OK if you like the change. The singer sounds like he's trapped in a bottle or at the bottom of a well. Not nearly as good, to me, as ""Second Coming""."
4,Very cool for any Clapton Fan,"If you have a few Clapton DVDs/Videos then you've seen small parts of some of these interviews. What is interesting here is you get the entire session on some of these. You see Eric interacting with the interviewers as if the camera is not on. Plus there's a few interviews, like some looney UK TV show, that people in the US wouldn't have seen.The portrait displayed is of a genuine man. It's very cool, while I'm sure EC isn't entirely off his guard, he is very casual.And while the only music is supplied by a 'TV show band' playing a bad rendition of Layla for 10 seconds, this is well worth it for the EC fan.And yeah, it does say 'INTERVIEWS' on the box. Couldn't be clearer!"
4,Interviews with Eric,This is a very good DVD - it contains interviews from about 1986 through 1998. There is a portion which was done one year after his son's death - and the interview was handled very well - and Clapton's responses to the questions give a very good insight to the man himself.The last interview leaves you rolling. I am unsure of who the personalities are - but you laugh until you cry. Eric can laugh at his own mistakes.He is human - and a good person. This is worth the watch.
4,No Music -- Only Interviews --->DUH!!,"This is a rather interesting look into the character of music icon Eric Clapton. Through various interviews, the viewer learns more about the man AND the music. If you are a Clapton fan, this is nearly required.The other reviewer is an IDIOT!!! It clearly says on the poster icon and the description that these are INTERVIEWS ONLY, NO PERFORMANCES BY THE ARTIST. Well, I guess it is too much to assume that someone would actually read the poster and the description of the product."
2,Not up to its reputation,"'The Celestial Toymaker' is a Doctor Who story which has something of a strong reputation based on the eponymous villain. Sadly, the Toymaker is really the only worthwhile element in this story.The story features the TARDIS crew, captured by the Toymaker, and forced to play against the Toymaker and his servants in a series of games. If they lose, they will become the Toymaker's playthings.The games are largely English school games and while this may have worked on-screen, the description of them is pretty unengaging. Unfortunately, most of this story no longer exists in its original form (and the one episode I have seen is pretty boring, too) so this may be the only way to enjoy this story.The Toymaker has been popular enough to return (in written form) a couple of times: you might want to read 'Nightmare Fair' or 'Divided Loyalties' to see him in a better story."
1,"Yuck, yuck, yuck!","I could only force myself to read the first two stories. There may be hidden gems here, but I'll never know. I like creepy. I like strange. These stories were just ugly, nasty, and stomach-turning. It felt like I was reading the mad ravings of a lunatic. Not in a clever way--just seriously disturbed."
3,cool but not perfect,"i've had this phone for about 4 months and it does turn heads. that being said i must also warn you that they have 2 main problems that i've experienced.1.-the joystick is on the outside and it's small and not flat to the phone which means it's easy to snap off. mine fell off after 4 months of just taking it around in my pocket.2.- the phone flips up with quite a bit of force and after a while it's not as ""tight"" as it used to be.so those are the things i dont like about the phone, what i do like are bluetooth,camera,triband,rhythm lights,looks,web access and mp3 ringtones. so basically it's a great phone just as long as your careful with it. i'm getting a v600 now for my work phone which is basically the same phone but quadband and a clamshell design but most importantly damn near indestructable."
4,"So, It's a Diffuser.","This is a 8.25 cast iron disk pretty much as shown. It works fine for turning the ""simmer"" flame on our gas range into a wider heat source that doesn't burn stuff in the pan. Since we do marinara sauce a couple times a month, this is important. Won't work on a flat ceramic cook top."
5,Great item..,"Well made, works great. Well packaged. I can now work outside and let the soup simmer without fear of burning. Rice does not burn. Wish I had know about this before."
2,book contains blaring inacuracies,"This early '70's caving guide did much to factionalize the colorado caving communtity. Parris' desire to print cave locations did much to contribute to cave vandalizim due to the lack of conservation content. Luckily, the poor maps and inacurate info helped save some caves."
2,"Love the band, not this album","Great band, but this album is for the diehard fans only. Too many skip-over songs. In fact, I really only repeatedly listen to one: Starseed.I prefer three of their other albums much much more: Clumsy, Gravity, and Healthy in Paranoid Times."
2,"Shaky debut album, disappointed after hearing the last 2","I didn't even know that Our Lady Peace had another album besides ""Clumsy"" and ""Happiness..."" until a few months ago. When I found this out, I was elated, because those other two albums are amongst my favorites of all-time. They are both basically flawless albums. After finally picking up ""Naveed"", I was greatly disappointed. This album has bascially nothing to offer except the title track, ""Naveed"", which is an awesome song. ""Starseed"" and ""Julia"" are decent, but absolutely nothing like the tracks Our Lady Peace put together on their last two albums. To compare this album is unfair, but it's truly not a good performance by Our Lady Peace. Most of the songs sound like the same song on a continuous loop. For fans who haven't yet bought this album, wait a few months for Our Lady Peace's 2001 release to come out."
4,"a nice debut, but they get better","this is a grunge album. OLP had not yet come out of their grunge shell to become what I consider the reigning kings of alternative rock. the track ""hope"" is the best song, with raine ripping out ""MY GOD SHE SAID!"" it takes your breath away. a good debut, but like i said, primarily a grunge album"
4,SOLID DEBUT ALBUM FROM OUR LADY PEACE,"Haliing from Canada, Our Lady Peace plays a catchy brand of rock and roll that is best described as a combination between Live and Stone Temple Pilots. Their debut album is full of raging rockers like ""the Birdman"", ""Starseed"", ""Is it Safe?"", and ""Julia"" as well as slower, introspective songs like ""Hope"", ""Naveed"" which has a great hook and chorus, and ""Denied"". Overall, the album is a quite a find as the production is solid, the lyrics are solid, and the playing is excellent."
5,A high energy jolt of alt rock,"From the opening track The Birdman to the last Neon Crossing each track on Naveed boils with an intense energy that most rock bands are lucky to reach on one song. Guitarist Mike Turner cuts loose with some wicked laser sounding guitar solos and Raine Maida's vocal performance can only be summed up in one word: passion. While OLP may have tempered their sound on Clumsy and Happiness... in order to hit the mainstream, anyone who considers themselves a fan of the band knows its trademark moment comes on the title track as a rumbling bass line leads into a cathartic call for freedom. A portrait of a young band bursting with energy."
5,"Pricey, but worth it.","This is a very light hold product; not for anything going up. I use it in combinations with medium hold products to achieve very soft styling's. This stuff lasts a while, so don't be put off by the price. It also smells great, unlike a lot of cheaper hairsprays."
2,Get the Uk series,"xYour best bet is to have a region free player and get the Uk discs. They're up to season 8.One day the complete series will be available here and there, so best bet is to wait."
3,It'll be dark by nightfall,"This is a one-disk collection of episodes beginning with the arrival of Foggy Dewhurst as Cyril Blamire's replacement. I didn't enjoy it as much as the Vintage 1995 collection, but it has it's moments. The quote ""It'll be dark by nightfall"" is one of Peter Sallis' throwaway lines that returns to the mind like a boomerang."
5,"Relaxing, peaceful, enjoyable !!!","So nice to have something to watch that is so relaxing. No killings, car chases , or violence, just a goofy group of geezers enjoying total freedom from job or family responsibilities."
5,summer wine,"It is one of the best British tv comedy series I've seen in a long time and I loved every story. I wish they would make the whole series available on DVD,I would be one of the first to buy them."
5,Great Resource,We purchased this edition because it includes the music. We have used it at home and in our Church with the children. I would recommend it.
1,broken,"My very responsible 10 year old only used his controller 5 times, for about 1 hour each time, and the analog stick broke. You would be better off buying a plain factory made controller and adding stickers to it. This controller is made very cheap. Buyers beware!!!!"
4,hot uncle #1,"Here's a blast from the past for me. I used to really love this series. My tastes have changed somewhat over the years so I haven't re-read this for quite some time, but, if nothing else, I think this may have been one of the forerunners in series about a family (both the men and women eventually having their story told.)As I recall, Anthony was the suave one who fell for the hot, Scottish chick. I think the main thing that annoyed me, tho, was her Scottish accent (spoken is fine, written is kinda hokey for me.)"
3,Not my favorite Malory-series novel,"I've read the Malory books out of order, and was interested to hear Anthony's story... And, of course, everything works itself out in the end. But I didn't entirely enjoy the process of getting there.There were bits and pieces of this book that were a bit different from some of the others, in terms of setting, background, and so on. But on the whole, it was pretty formulaic to the rest of the series. This Malory family member is about as condescending and high-handed as most of the rest of them, and his intended-beloved is sort-of likable at the beginning; they actually get married, and all of a sudden, she turns into a psycho-jerk. I really wanted Anthony Malory to throttle her. I found myself rooting for him, and wanting her to get her comeuppance. I'm not sure that was the author's goal."
4,Uncle Tony's own seduction,"Sequel to the first Malory novel- Love Only Once. The story is heart warming, definitely not to be miss by Lindsey's fans and those who dearly loved the Malory. Better than before,this story revolves Anthnoy Malory, the uncle to Regina Eden and Roslynn Chadwick, a Scottish heiress. A whirlwind of instant attraction and bold romance between both of them will ties them in a stormy marriage. With Roslynn's little trust on her own heart, she defies Anthony even after the marriage. Thier marriage was definitely having lots of ups and downs, and doses of adventures before both knew that their heart was stolen by the other. Definitely a keep for the Malory fans!"
5,one of the best,"I HAVE READ ALMOST ALL OF THE MALORY BOOKS. THE ONLY ONE I DID NOT READ WAS GENTAL ROUGE AND THIS ONE. I HAD WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND CHECKED IT OUT. I AM DEFINTLY GOING TO BUY IT FOR MY COLLECTION.ROSELYN IS A FIRY SCOT THAT HAS BOTH ANTHONY AND JAMES INTEREST PIKED. IN THIS BOOK THE PLOT IS BOTH WONDERFULLY MADE AND WELL THOUGHT OUT I CANNOT WAIT TO READ THE ""GENTAL ROUGE"" IF IT IS AS WELL WRITTEN AS THIS ONE I WILL ENJOY IT EMENSLY.THANK YOUDE"
4,Loved it! malory's are the best!,"I didnt give it 5 stars because it isnt my favorite, but I loved it never the less. Malory books are very intriguing and keep you interested. This one is the 2nd in the series. I loved Anthony, he's charming and sexy. Roslynn is someone you'd like to know in real life. Nothing bad to say about this book, enjoy!"
2,"In the beginning, I didn't like the hero...","... but in the end, I really disliked the heroine. And Anthony didn't really grow on me either.I don't think there is anything to recommend Anthony - except of course for his good looks and his skills as a lover. But apart from that? He is an arrogant, selfish bastard. He doesn't do anything useful with his time - or his life - but prances around seducing women, gambling and drinking. He knows Roslyn desperately needs a husband, and knows that he won't marry her, but is still trying to ruin hewr every time they run into each other. That she 'can't resist him' is not an excuse. I really really disliked him. Towards the end he redeemed himself a bit, but by then Roslyn became a complete shrew. I was all so stupid. But what do I expect from a 'big missunderstanding' story. Reasonable heroes would obviously be too much to expect."
3,"I liked it overall, but there were parts I didn't like.","CAUTION SPOILERS:I didn't like Roslynn holding a grudge for so long. Also, I didn't like Anthony not defending himself. He could have provided witnesses to Roslynn about the barmaid coming to him and his refusal of the barmaid. Roslynn and Anthony should have talked openly instead of fighting for several weeks. I did like the way Anthony beat up and lied to Geordi to get him to leave Roslynn alone.Sexual content: not evaluated. I read this book before I began counting sex scenes and describing the language. As I recall, it was probably mild. Setting: 1818 England. Copyright: 1988. Genre: regency romance.For a list of my reviews of other Johanna Lindsey books, see my 5 star review of ""Gentle Rogue"" posted 6/14/08."
5,Tender rebel,Tender rebel what can i say only wow the way johanna lindesy pulls you in to a book is amazing
1,Awful,"I Hated the Narration of this (cassette) story, I will never buy another narrated story again, by this woman. She absolutly ruined the story for me (what I actually listened to. I couldn't stand 5 min. of this story.) She gave me a headache because she talked entirely TOO FAST, she had NO emotion what so ever, I couldn't tell when she was finished with one character and on to another. Uterley disapointed to say the least. I should of bought the book, now its too late. I have read Johanna Lindsey's books faithfully, I assumed the cassette would be good for travel...WRONG. I will continue to buy Johanna's story's by the book only."
3,Not Bad,"I love Johanna Lindsey. I read my 1st romance book through her. I loved Gentle Rogue and I really couldn't wait to read this. I liked the book but it just seemed like Ros could have had a little more self respect than getting busy at a ball and she hadn't really known Anthony that long. If she could have also had a little more spunk to her to match Anthony's wit, it would have been nice too. In the end, not a bad read but it seems like Johanna is losing her enticement instincts in her novels. We'll see on the next book."
4,Anthony .....sigh.,I enjoyed this book because Anthony is a Rake. And not a rake because of some horrible secret...he has no despondant past...he just loves women. I loved that it wasn't Roslynn's job to fix him in anyway. I hated that he came home with a blonde hair on his coat...I couldn't have delightfully skipped over that half of the story but in the end they are in love ...exactly how it is supposed to be...Good book.
3,It lacked a bit,"Okay... This story lacke a bit for me. First, Roslynn was really self centered and was hard to like, and have empathy for. Anthony was pretty predictable, and was an okay hero. I found myself not being able to fully picture scenes. While the story was okay, it lacked in the telling of the story. After 2 Malory novels, on to a different author. Maybe I'll come back to this family, but I need to read some better stories first."
5,Great Book!,I loved this book and hope the full series is just as good. Looking forward to reading the next book.
5,James Mallory in Love,"He's a brat. He's spoiled. He's RICH!(Not to mention handsome as all get out with his long blond hair and gold earringas well as being huge.) He's in fantastic physical condition and will fight anything and anyone....and win!He would defend the woman he loves with his last breath, much to Georgina's exasperation.Johanna Lindsey has family dynamics down to a tee and her character portrayals are quite realistic. If I can Imaginea character from his or her description and like them, or not as the storyline dictates, then I am transported to another time and place. What a boon! This book does just that! Read and enjoy."
4,Fun read.,Johanna Lindsey is entertaining and writes a great story. Her characters are well portrayed and I like reading stories about this period of English history.
4,Fun Fun Fun,"Full Tilt is another fun book by Janet Evanovich. If you read Full House this brings back Max and Deedee, but 20 years later. Frankie, Deedee's husband, is running for mayor and begins a search of missing tax dollars. His brother-in-law, the infamous Max Holt, comes to town to help him out. Of course Max meets Jamie Swift and is instantly attracted. The story goes from there and it is a fun read...but no steamy sex like they claim on the back cover!I couldn't put the book down and had to find out who was responsible for the attempted murders and missing tax dollars. Evanovich scores again with this murder mystery hijinx story. You can always count on her stories to be fun and entertaining and this one is."
1,No Thanks,"I'm a huge Evanovich/Plum fan. But this book was a huge disappointment. While Evanovich has been masterful at developing zany characters, the collection in this book suffocates. Too many, too condensed and often, too incongruous in the display of their personalities. The plot fed the reader a literary diet of constant crisis that left me feeling over-stuffed, uncomfortable and yearning for some sort of mental Maalox."
5,ENTERTAINING STORY,"While different than the Stephanie Plum stories, this book is a lot of fun. It keeps you guessing and laughing. Highly recommend."
5,"""Hart to Hart"" in Paperback But Better","What fun! Evanovich's wit with characters, dialogue, and circumstances is evident throughout. The characters are edgy but believable and lots of fun. While the back jacket promise of ""steamy sex"" isn't fulfilled, the rest is true. It was a quick, fun, LOL book. Evanovich and Hughes are a great team. I'm looking forward to ""Full Speed"" and hoped to pre-order with ""To The Nines"" but will have to be patient."
1,Full Slide!,"Boring! Hardly worth writing a review. I have about 50 pages to read and I don't even care if I finish it. Big disappointment. Stephenie Plum & Co. are the lights of my reading life. What happened here? I see other reviewers putting the onus on Charlotte Hughes for this dud. I don't think so! I have read a number of Ms. Hughes books and have always enjoyed them. She is a good writer. I just don't think two people can write a good book. Instead of getting the best of both, I think that here, at least, we got the worst of both authors. Too bad. So sad."
2,A disappointment,I really felt this was just a bad take off from the Stephanie Plum series. It was the same characters with different names and different foibles. I took a chance and paid for it. I won't fall into that trap again.
1,Stupid,"I adore the Stephanie Plum series so I thought I'd try the Full series. The first one was so-so, but this one, the second, is just plain stupid. I especially hated Muffin, the talking computer."
1,A real let-down,"What a disappointment! This book cannot be written by Janet Evanovich, it must be Charlotte Hughes' baby.It is the characters that are the worst part of this book, they are wooden. Worst of the worst is Max, the ""genius"", who never speaks in anything but cliches and platitudes. A close second is Muffin, Max's car's Artificial Intelligence system with a dumb blonde personality.It finally grated on me so bad that I abandoned the effort part-way through. Not something I do often."
1,Double Dumb,It's sad and annoying to see Evanovich use her name and reputation to put out such garbage.The humor isn't humorous. There are none of the laugh out loud moments that've become trademark with the Stephanie Plum series. This is a weak attempt at comedy that comes off looking like tragedy.As Jamie would say...double damn. This series is awful.
2,Full Tilt,"Tedious, belabored. Completely missing the fun and spark of the Stephanie Plum series, this book would more likely appeal to romance fans."
1,The authors have plumbed new depths of mediocrity.,"The kindest word I can think of for this tripe is 'lame.' Never mind the authors, they aren't supposed to be objective about their work, but the publisher ought to get, as Earl Emerson would say, ""five knuckles to the snot locker."""
1,Don't waste your time!,"I love Janet Evanovich! Her early works were great and her Plum Series was evan better. Even Full House was okay. This book was a huge disappointment. The writing is choppy, the humor is corny at best, and the book was difficult to finish because it was so boring."
1,Waste of Your Money,"I can only assume Janet Evanovich has lent her name to ""Full House"" and ""Full Tilt"" and let Charlotte Hughes do most of the writing. Because the person (Evanovich) who has written the great Stephanie Plum books, cannot possibly have lent time and effort into this junk.I read ""Full House"" because Evanovich's name was on it. It was sorta cute.I read ""Full Tilt"" because Evanovich's name was on it. It was pure waste of time.I've purchased my last Evanovich/Hughes collaboration. Don't waste your hard-earned dollars, people."
1,"This was bad, folks","FULL TILT: wasn't worth the trees ruthlessly killed to make the millions of copies of this book. Heck, it wan't even worth it for just my copy. The plot was flimsy, In fact, I couldn't even tell you what it was about. I think it was supposed to be cute and zany, but it was really just confusing. The mistaken-identity-aka-""you lied to me, I'll never trust you again, kiss me you fool"" card was used up in the first few pages. After that, I don't have a clue what happened. Something about small town politics, professional wrestlers running for office, and other such nonsense. The editing and sentance structure was downright bad, and the characters couldn't hold my attention for 10 minutes. I ended up skipping to the end. Maybe I'm just not in a contemporary romance mood, but I found FULL TILT to be boring and silly."
5,Full of fun...,"Max, the boy-genius from Full house, is back and he's all grown up! He's in Beaumont, South Carolina to help his sister's husband find out who wants to keep him out of the race for Mayor. Max is also checking on his interest in Beaumont's paper...and a growing interest in the paper's owner, Jamie Swift. Missing tax dollars, would-be assassins, and a talking car...Jamie and Max are hot on the case. And maybe they're a bit hot for each other??!!Evanovich and Hughes are a powerful writing team. Full Tilt is full of fun!!"
1,Very bad mixture,"I bought this book only because I was stranded in an airport for 2 days. I totally regretted buying it! Really poorly written...authors seem to have tried to bring in humor, sex and mystery...but didnt really suceed in doing so.I hope the authors try to be more consistent in their writing in future."
2,Full TIlt,"For Stephanie Plum fans, this book will be disappointing. Evanovich had not hit on her literary style when she wrote this story, which is an unrealistic romance with none of the excitement or pizzaz we love. A quick read with little substance."
2,I had hoped for more!,"I am a true fan of Janet Evanovich, and will continue to read her work, but I kept reading Full Tilt hoping I'd get to the good part, but the good part never came! I'm giving it two stars just because I know there's a story in there for Max and Jamie, I just didn't find it. I look forward to Full Speed, not to mention To The Nines (love you, Stephanie!)and hope the next installment will be worth my time."
1,What was she thinking?,"I was so mad after reading this stinker I mailed it back to the publisher. Evanovich must really like her ""good friend"" Charlotte Hughes if she lent her name to this thing, which can't possibly have much Evanovich writing in it. Insipid, plodding, a compendium of trite -- maybe it's supposed to be some kind of send-up?"
2,So incredibly bad,"This story is so bad. The plot is lame, the scenes are poorly conceived, and the dialogue is downright pathetic. It's so cliche and unrealistic--like something a 13-year-old would write. I wish I'd read the reviews before I got it. The only good thing about this book is that I didn't pay anything for it--just borrowed it from the library.Don't bother with this book!"
2,Not Plum,"Not as good as the Plum novels. I bought this book because I was waiting for the next Stephanie Plum book to come out and needed something to read. It's ok, but doesn't come close to the Plum series."
1,"Max, sexy??","Sorry, I just couldn't buy it. He's the kid-genius from ""Full House."" We're flash-forwarding some twenty-years (I would have LOVED to know what happened to Nick and Billie), and he's hot? No. I just kept thinking of the kid from the first book. Perhaps, it's different if you've never read the first book. The characters didn't appeal to me at all either. Sorry. Some people really seemed to like it, but not this reviewer."
1,A Disappointment,"I'm very disappointed with this book. The plot was ridiculous, boring and convoluted. The characters lacked any kind of chemistry, and were completely uninteresting. I don't know how Janet Evanovich can do such a good job with her Stephanie Plum series, and be so consistently disappointing with her other work."
2,Evanovich Phones It In,"What a shame that such a talented author has co-written such a lifeless, unfunny story. The premise, genius Max Holt from ""Full House"" as a grown up zillionaire inventor, is so promising, but the writing is boring! Where are the off-the-wall characters, zingy dialog and screwball situations J.E. liberally flings into her books? Come on, Janet, you know this isn't good writing!"
2,Not up to Plum,"Full Tilt is a mildly entertaining read. You'll get a couple of chuckles, but thats it. Janet evanovich's Stefanie Plum books are much better. I love the Plum Books and so I picked up Full Tilt, thinking it had to be great, I was very disappointed. there is not much in the romance department, And not much in the mystery department. The charachters are pretty flat and one sided and the whole novel seems to fall on its face. Don't be fooled by Evanovichs name on the title. Full Tilt is definitly not up to Plum."
1,A Stinker!,"I'm not sure what these ladies were thinking when they wrote this. I love the Stephanie Plum novels, but I absolutely hated the character DeeDee! She is so annoying I can't overlook her; all of the characters seem way over-the-top stereotypical. There's the gay assistant, the political ex-wrestler, the richy rich guy with only the best gadgets. Pass on this one."
2,Mixed Bag,"Like many of the other reviewers, I was disappointed in this book. The heroine, Jamie, is not particularly likeable and was such a shrew to Max most of the time, that I had a hard time understanding his attraction to her. I particularly cringed every time the woman said ""double damn"" and stamped her foot. Come on... how old is Jamie supposed to be? Also the writing at times was sloppy. Max and Dee Dee's cousin Nick was once referred to as their uncle and then again as ""Max"". More careful proofreading, please.That being said, I _did_ enjoy the story. I'll buy the sequel because I think the Jamie/Max duo has promise and the storyline itself held my interest. At the end, I was ready to get in the car and go off with them. I'm just hoping that their next adventure finds Jamie in a better mood."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was sooooo disappointed! I buy the Stephanie Plum books in hardback so I know that Janet is usually good for the investment, but this book was BAD. The writing was so poor, it made me cringe. Didn't anyone edit it? The plot was weak and unoriginal, but I could never seem to get past the junior-high level poor grammar and cliche-ridden writing style. I rarely find it hard to finish a book--I'll slog through almost anything--but I skipped a large portion of this one to read the ending. The first book in the series was an acceptable early Evanovich. My advice to the publisher is to kill the rest of the series now."
2,Let down...,"I, too, struggled through this book and was disappointed. It is very distracting when the lead character's brother-in-law is called his cousin sometimes and his brother-in-law at other times. It was a little difficult to read and it was the second book by her that I've read where there are inconsistencies. Why isn't the editor catching these errors?"
1,Not Janet Evanoviches Best by far!,"This book was very slow and while it was supposed to be written in light of the Stephanie Plum books it had very little ""laugh out loud"" parts that I always found in the Plum series. I was pretty disappointed"
5,Another great book by Evanovich,I have enjoyed all Ms Evanovich's books. They are all very funny and hard to put down. Another great read!
2,You're better off waiting for the next Stephanie Plum,"Billionaire with a feminine version of a Knight Rider car drives into small-town newspaper editor's life, and it's mostly annoying.The book doesn't COMPLETELY lack a hope of romance or a mysterious element. And perhaps Full Tilt would have been better if we didn't already know and love Janet Evanovich and her ability to create a relaxed mystery with scandalous sexual tension. Chances are, you'll be disappointed at the cardboard-cutout characters, the substandard mystery and the perimenopausal automobile.Full Tilt wants to be a fun book, but really isn't."
1,What a disappointment,I started reading this hoping for the snappiness of the Stephanie Plum series but gave up before finishing. This series is just not worth the time.
5,Riveting,"This is one of the best books I've read by Janet Evanovich. It may be the addition of 's Hughes, but the characters and the storyline are excellent."
4,ITS DIFFERENT,ITS NOT A PLUM NOVEL SO DON'T COMPARE THIS BOOK /SERIES TO THEM. Every author writes in different styles and I am great full that Janet and Charlotte have come together to create this series. I am glad that I didn't listen to the reviews I read before I purchased this book. I like the fast pace action and the surprises that are at every corner. The book keeps you guessing as to who done it and why......but you really dont find out the truth until the end. Great book for teenagers as well as adults who dont like detailed sex in their reading.
5,Fully Tilted Book,A great book. Theses two authors our meant to write together. I love the characters in this series of books.
1,Too Little Too Late,"My friends and even my mom love Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books. At Christmastime, I read my first Evanovich book--her ""Christmas"" Stephanie Plum novelette--and loved it. I picked up Full Tilt and expected the same quality, but no. I read half way through the book and put it down. There was no hook, only meagre characterizations and ""been there, done that"" storyline. My advice to Janet E.--write books on your own and save your friends for shopping and lunching out."
3,"Not fantastic, not horrible just hummmm","After reading all the reviews I guess I'm just a middle of the roader. This book is definitely not in a league with Ms Evanovich's Plum series. The characters were not as vivid,the dialog was not as laugh out loud funny, and the romantic tension in ""Tilt"" was tepid rather than steamy (be still my heart Morelli and Ranger). But,I've read far less engaging books, a back handed compliment if ever there was one. So, hopefully the second book, and I will buy it, will have gotten the kinks out and will begin to come up to the level Ms Evanovich's readers know she is capable of producing."
1,Full Tilt(ing) downhill!,"I love the Stephanie Plum books and have read them all. Didn't care that much for the Christmas book but at least it was all Evanovich. I read ""Full House"" and while it wasn't on the same level as the Plum stories, it was entertaining enough. But this one has gone from fair to really poor. I do like romance novels as well as mysteries, but believe me this book missed in either genre. I think Evanovich is coming up with the characters and Charlotte Hughes is doing the writing. Full Tilt is missing something romantically. I didn't feel a real attraction or sexual tension between the main characters (not like what there is between Stephanie and Morelli or Ranger). Also, the computer in the car was stupid. Muffin didn't come accross as real at all. I definetly will not buy the next book in this series!"
1,Very disappointing,"I squirmed through this book, and wish I hadn't bothered. It's a dull psuedo-romance, neither ""wacky"" nor an ""adventure"". The situations and characters have potential but evolve into nothing, flat and lacking in interest, sex, and humor. I disliked Full House just as much--but a fabulous series like the Plums seemed to warrant a second chance for this series, too. I will NOT invest in a third Full-whatever if and when it appears.Maybe Evanovich helped outline, but if she was involved in the actual writing I'd be surprised. If this is representative of Hughes' writing style, I'm avoiding her books forever. If I could speak to the authors, I'd ask them to see if they could be more engaging and less annoying in the first person, rather than than the traditional romance-novel third."
4,Great take-along,"This petite paperback easily fits into a purse or on the car dashboard for wine-tasting trips, and just as easily on the bookshelf for quick reference. It's concise and informative, including addresses and phone numbers of wineries - great for when you're lost on a wine country road, searching for a hidden tasting room, or when you just need to find out the winery's hours of operation. It also offers a quick glance at specific, highly rated wines and specialties from each winery. The book's only unavoidable fault is that it's slightly outdated. Since it was published in 2003, hundreds of new wineries have popped up around the Northwest, and some older ones have moved, closed or changed phone numbers. Overall, though, it's an excellent guide, especially to the older, more established wineries of the Pacific Northwest."
3,works well on MOST breeds....,but after giving it to my mini schnauzer for several years i found out that it has ingredients in it that contributed to my dog's high ph levels so we had to stop using it. they have come down closer to normal since i stopped giving it to her. do your research before giving this to your pet.
1,This product does not give you all the important details...,What insects lore does not tell you is that they will not ship the larvae if it is colder than 55 degrees. That became a problem for me since i purchased this to be a Christmas present.
2,Bad Design,"I bought this kit for my daughter and we all had great fun watching the larvae grow and morph into lady beetles. Unfortunately, the container is poorly designed. When you take the lid off to give them water, the lady bugs (at whatever stage) wander into the crevice meant for the lid. They are then squished when you try to replace the lid. Out of the 10 larvae, we ended up with one lady beetle to release. The rest died in the manner described above. If the container was designed a little differently, we would consider buying more."
1,Don't waste your money. Disappointing,My daughter got this as a present. I had to pay $5 to get the ladybug larva delivered. Feel the first shipment should be for free. Then I had to put tape around all the seems because they were able to slip under the lid and escape. When they finally hatched from the cocoon stage they were brown not the typical red and black. I know that ladybugs come in all colors but his is designed for kids which expect red and black. It's cheaper and more fun to go to OSH and get a bucket of lady bugs which have about a hundred and then put those in the container. Would not buy this again I would just stick to their butterfly land
1,"Tried it Twice, Disappointed","After the first disappointment, I decided to try again and order the lady bug larvae a second season. Just the larvae cost about as much as the entire kit itself. When it arrived, we followed the directions exactly. Sadly, there were only 4 living larvae (whereas the material promised something like 15) and they all died within 3 days. Even more disappointing, I wrote a letter to the company explaining my unhappiness, and they never wrote back. After mostly dead larvae twice now and poor customer service, I cannot recommend this kit."
5,Grands love it,"Bought this in conjunction with the butterfly garden. the children loved watching the little ladybugs hatch and grow. Good learning tool, especially for those of us who home school our children."
5,Great,I love our ladybug land. This is the second one as we donated the last one to a classroom. Great for kids.
1,Sometimes Cannibals (but not always)!,"Our ladybug larvae seemed to prefer to eat each other rather than the food which came with our shipment of ladybugs. It was rather gruesome to watch, so we let the larvae loose outside. The company representative we spoke with had no explanation for the phenomenon, but was willing to ship us another package of ladybugs free of charge. I don't think we can handle watching a repeat of the cannibalism.The new larvae behaved themselves (i.e., they didn't eat each other). They grew to maturity and we relaeased them into the backyard. I guess ladybugs, like love, can be better the second time around."
1,Not Pleased...,"My husband and I bought this for our 4 year old son for his birthday. The land arrived withen only a few days. We sent off for the ladybugs that night and the wait began. After a week, I checked my bank and found they had cashed the check, so I waited some more. I called after about 10 days and found out the ladybug had shipped. The ladybugs arrived 13 days after shipment and most were dead. My son was vey upset, he was looking forward to having his ladybugs. We did what we could to help the 2 that made it here alive, but it was to no avail. The paper that comes with the ladybug started to grow mold, as did the sponge inside. We also found out the ladybugs are allergenic, so parents be warned. This was a waste of $20, I wish now I had bought my son something else."
2,Dead larvae!,"Like another reviewer, I also received a tube of what looked like dead larvae. Only 1 was alive in the end. I called up Customer Service and was on the phone waiting to talk to a live person for 50 minutes! Finally got through to someone & they said they would send some more. Nothing yet though.The actual ladybug land is very cheaply made and the children can easily pull the top off & then the ladybugs can escape. So just beware."
3,No Ladybugs in the Land,"I bought this for my niece, Alex, in 2004 when she was three. She had just dressed up as a ladybug for Halloween and I thought it would make a fun project to work on in the afternoons with her grandparents.The day the toy arrived, Alex was ecstatic, however, first the larvae would have to be ordered. Her ecstasy subsided over the period of SIX WEEKS that it took for the larvae to arrive.Once the larvae arrived, Alex's grandparents followed the directions perfectly. No matter. The larvae sprouted, stumbled around Ladybug Land for a couple of days, then died.The habitat was adorable. The bugs just didn't want to live there.It was a disappointment for everyone, though, at times like this, we should look to the wisdom of children.Alex: ""All of them died but at least we still have their house."""
5,Great educational tool!,"I purchased this for teacher appreciation, the kids had a blast learning all about the lady bug life cycle. Makes a great teacher gift ."
3,"nice, but not great","I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old niece. It was smaller than expected and the magnifying viewer is useless. She liked it though, and that is what's important."
3,Not a great design,"I was very excited to order these for my kids this spring. The concept is great. The problem I had was when I poured the ladybug larvae into the habitat, it was very hard to not dump it over the water sponge. Once I put the ladybugs in, I couldn't take apart the habitat to clean it and within a few days, there was mold growing in the water sponge.Aside from that, my kids thought it was really neat to see the transformation from almost microscopic larvae to beautiful ladybugs. I will try this again in the spring and try to be more careful to not get any stuff from the tube in the water dish."
1,Ladybugs never came,"I am really disappointed and more importantly so is my 5 year old son. We had bought a butterfly kit from Insect Lore last year and had great luck with it and loved it. So I bought him the Ladybug Land for his birthday in July. We sent off our card and waited for our ladybugs to arrive...and waited...and waited...and waited. Finally I contacted Insect Lore who said the ladybugs must have got lost in the mail and sent me a coupon to order them again. They asked that I wait until the end of September to order so it was cooler (we live in Miami). So I waited until the beginning of October, sent our card in and again waited for nothing. Now they're saying the ladybugs got lost AGAIN. My poor little boy gets excited every time I check the mail hoping they'll be here and they never will. Now I'm trying to find another company we can order the larvae from in hopes we might actually get them from someone else."
4,Ladybugs are so weird!,"I bought this as a shared gift for my two girls who are 2 and 8 for Christmas. After the initial disappointment that there were no actual ladybugs included in the set, their interest was renewed when the larvae came in the mail a week & additional $5 later. Even though we have a book about ladybugs, we didn't know how they actually change. Currently they are all balled up and stuck to the walls in our ""Land"" slowly morphing into flying spotted insects right before our very eyes! Every day they change a little bit and they aren't in a cocoon, so you can actually see it. I'm just dreading coaxing them out of the tiny little hole in the top once they have grown. I guess it's a good thing little fingers can't access their home, but it sure would be nice to pop the top off to clean the home for the next batch. Next, hissing cockroach land? ... nah."
4,Lady Bug Land,Great for kids. I bought this for my nephew and he's having a ball watching the lady bug lands. I suggest this for kids. Entertaining and leads to educational conversations and he loves it - most importantly.
1,dead bugs; disappointed grand-daughter,"After you buy this item, you must pay another $5.00 to get the ladybug larvae. I did. When the bugs came, in a plastic tube, half were dead. There were about 5 live ones left. I tapped them into the enclosure, with the sponge dampened, per instructions. When I looked at them, later that same day, all of them were dead. Zero value for my money. I will try to get a replacement from Insect Lore, since Amazon doesn't cover it. Wish me luck."
5,Loved this toy,"My 6 year old daughter loved this toy. She is having fun studying the bugs from our garden, we did not even receive the mail order bugs yet."
1,$5 processing and handling fee,"Once this had arrived, I was ready to fill in the coupon for the lady bug larvae when I noticed that there is a $5 fee for getting our ""free"" lady bugs. If you go to the website to order the larvae, it does show a $0 amount for the larvae in the shopping cart, but when you go to check out there is a $5 processing and handling fee. I find it very dishonest that Amazon and Insect Lore do not bother to tell you that you have to pay an additional fee to get your lady bugs."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun",I bought this for my 3 year's birthday. She loves ladybugs. The larva arrived about 3 weeks after sending in the money. They are easy to care for and fun to watch develope so fast...
3,Too bad the company that delivers bugs doesn't care...,"Bought this for a Christmas present in 2010. The kids I gave it to really liked it, but the ladybugs didn't show up for two and a half months. I called the company before ever buying the product to make sure the bugs were shipping and was told that they would have them. I was later told that they couldn't ship them due to the weather. Had the bugs showed up faster it would have been a 5 star rating. The kids absolutely loved it and got a chance to watch how ladybugs develop and grow. The dome itself is durable enough, however it would be really easy to smash the ladybugs if your not really careful. If you buy any of these products (they also have butterflies and praying mantis kits) just don't give it to the kid until you have the bugs. Also... There isn't any reason that you couldn't reuse the kits. Either buy more bugs or even see what you can find outside."
3,Great Gift!,"I have 15 nieces and nephews so you can imagine Christmas is hard on the pockets. I try to get the kids something of educational value. I came across these looking for butterfly kits, and fell in love. This product came well before the estimated delivery date and I couldn't beat the price! All the kids loved them as did the adults. In fact, I sort of wish I bought one for myself. Durable plastic, yet light weight and easily portable. I can't wait to give them something else from this company next year!"
3,a little more info please,"I purchased this as a gift for my grandson. The ladybug larva arrived dead. I did not see in the online literature where it was best to purchase this item in the fall/winter seasons. I did see that information on the praying mantis literature. I'm sure this product is great, he enjoyed the butterfly larva we purchased in the past. But, it was a big disappointment to him not to be able to see anything or use the circus I purchased to go with it."
2,Smaller than it looks,They make it look much bigger in the picture and was really surprised when I opened the box. Guess I should have read the dimensions.
3,You will pay three dollars extra for your larvae!!!,False advertising. Three bucks isn't a big deal but the package says the larvae are prepaid... I would have rather paid three dollars more for the product than have to send a three dollar check to this company! So ridiculous. Will not buy again-- what if this were a gift!? Here you go-- a gift the recipient has to help pay for! UGH. Full disclosure would have been nice.
3,A little boring--kids review,"I couldn't wait for when the lady bugs arrived in the mail. When they finally did, I was grossed out at the fact that they were tiny larvae. There wasn't much to watch besides the fact that you had to feed them everyday or else they'd die, but reaching my hand in there was probably one of the most dreaded things of the day...especially because nobody else would do it for me!A lot of people complain that the ladybugs didnt live but I think all of mine made it to the ladybug stage. It may have been a disgusting process, but it felt great to finally let them go.I recommend not getting these if you are not going to be willing to feed them and see white larvae."
2,AMAZON/INSECT LORE FAIL!! DOES NOT INCLUDE LADYBUGS!!!!!,"Buyer beware! Order this kit at least 3 weeks before you want the ladybugs as you have to use the coupon code included PLUS pay an additional $5 to get the ladybugs shipped to your home. My son was checking the mail daily and then in tears when he realized he had no ladybugs to start the kit with. Amazon should include that as part of the main product listing to help potential buyers, as well. Insect Lore Ladybug Land WITHOUT Live Bugs would be more accurate of a description. HOT SOUTHERN & SW STATES ARE RESTRICTED for bug delivery during certain months--another reason to order your bugs asap! Insect Lore's website offers Ladybug Land with the larvae for $19.99 and you only have to place your order once. Two stars all around. [...]"
1,Rip OFF!!!,"We ordered the Lady Bug Land for our daughter for Easter. There were no lady bugs included! NO WHERE on the order form in their catalogue or on their website does it say anything about the lady bugs NOT being included. So they give you a coupon and an order form that says you have to include FIVE DOLLARS for shipping and handling of the lady bugs, after we already paid $19.99. TOTAL RIP OFF. Do not order this product. If you want your child to learn about lady bugs, you're better off just walking out to your back yard in the spring and get your own lady bugs!!!"
3,Almost Perfect,"The text and the price were right for a new text, but this text was supposed to have the ""My Developmental Lab"" CD and access code since it is new and stated it in the description. Check with your professors before buying it here because my NEW text came opened and with out the My Development Lab products that were necessary for my class."
4,Development Through the Lifespan,This textbook has a lot of information packed inside. It also contains a lot of interesting personal stories that sort of breaks up the monotony of scientific language.
5,book,By far the best purchase I made on Amazon. Saved about 98% buying this book. It was a dream come true. I couldn't be happier and the book looks brand spanken new!
2,The Good and the Bad,"I like how this book begins each chapter with a personal story, and how everything is related to life experiences that Mrs. Berk has had, but I found it very difficult to get through the chapters, because so much of it seemed like unnecessary or uninteresting elaboration, and her personal views on controversial political concerns (health care, for example) were quite clear, with little representation from opposing views. I often found myself pressed for time, and the sheer volume of each chapter was frustrating, such that I often skimmed for context, copied definitions, and then read through the summary for all the important things. Furthermore, I found that doing so was an effective way of studying for my class.I know that the subject material is interesting. I just feel that this book did not bring out that aspect of Developmental Psychology."
4,its a must to have,its a need product and I am happy to get it for my full set! will buy more when times come!
2,"Beautiful book, literary failure ...","I was really dissapointed by Allendes latest book. I am an avid reader, and besides ""Paula"" I've read all her books. Some of them I loved, some of them i just enjoyed, for her style of writing is unique and masterful enough to keep one wanting to read on. The ""Aphrodite"" however was most dissapointing. For me, it looked more like an unedited, hastily printed diary, then either the cookbook or a study of aphrodisiacs, as the book appears to have been intended. Sure enough, Allende hasn't lost her wit or the ability to write compelling stories. It had probably more of the ""personal"" touch then most of her previous books, and that I found quite compelling and worthy the time spent. However, the book as a whole seems to lack something, it feels just too ""loosely"" bound ! I'm hoping that her next book will not be more ""commercial"", riding on the fame one. Give us another ""Eva Luna"" Isabel. I love your books too much to believe that ""Aphrodite"" is ""IT""."
4,"Interesting ""cook"" book",Interesting book. I will try some of the recipies. It was recommended to me and as much as I don't like to cook I am making list of groceries and I will try few recipies. Arrived promptly and in good shape.
3,Love and food,"Two of the most exquisite pleasures put together ! Through receipts coming from all over the world , Isabel Allende is funny and writes an enjoyable book . But in the end , the reader has the feeling that all kinds of food can be aphrodisiac . Of course , the reader may also conclude that love is more in the mind of each one than on the specific food you eat ."
3,Not her usual,"Ms. Allende is an excellent novelist. Her books are sexy, romantic, and surreal. Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses, is more like a text book or a coffee table book. A good book full of sexy recipes with exotic ingredients and interesting insights about her personal life, with comments about her husband and her upbringing. Definitely worth reading for any Allende fan."
5,Too delicious to put down,"To say I love this book would be putting it mildly; I just adore it. The recipes are sinfully delicious (and calorie-laden), and the tales are tastefully erotic and funny, just as I expected from the author. If you haven't bought it, do it now; even if you don't like it, you still could learn a useful thing or two."
2,John Grisham He's Not,"My first impression of Steve Martini's writing style was certainly not a good one. I have a pretty good opening sequence where two lawyers are gunned down gangland style, the story creeps into a boring state. Shallow character development and poor introduction of other players in this novel cause me to wonder,""What's going on here?""A few action scenes emerge to wake me from slumber. The description gets a little better. An interesting betrayal than takes place. However, the ending is about as realistic as a poor Stephen Segal movie.I will consider try reading another book by Stephen Martini. He seems to have several legal thrillers on the market. However, The Arraignment novel did not strike my fancy in the least."
3,Madriani should stick to the courtroom,"I quite like those Madriani novels that stick to the courtroom, but the ones where he goes galivanting off to Mexico lose me. Fans of the series will want to read this. Action fans will probably like the windup, but will likely be impatient with the earlier part. In short, this is too long, inappropriately titled, and basically disappointing."
2,Not so much court-based...,"I've read the whole Madriani's episodes and I think this is the less interesting. In general, Steve Martini is really bright in portraying the defense-prosecutor in court fight. All of his ""trial-based"" books are very entertaining. I can't say the same of this one - that is, in fact, a bit ""far"" from Martini's usual milieu. It is, nevertheless, a good reading, but don't expect Madriani at his best!"
3,Dana Rush loses height,"On page 5, author Martini describes Dana Rush, the trophy wife, as ""four inches taller than Nick"" and ""tall and tan."" But on page 56, she is ""slight of build, five foot three in stocking feet...would weigh no more than a hundred and five pounds soaking wet."" Does this mean Nick was four-eleven? No, I think it means no one ever edited this book. Also, there are countless annoying editorial lapses: who's instead of whose, it's for its, and the like. Book is lively and vividly written, but I am shocked that G. P. Putnam's Sons did such a poor job."
1,Disappointing!,The story started off with great promise. Then it just died. The last part is so disappointing that I can hardly finish reading it. The writer didn't seem to know what he wanted to say or how to end the story. He just made up some totally ridiculous plots to try to tie everything together. And it doesn't work!
2,"Plodding, Boring, Low Tension ""Thriller""","This is not one of Martini's better efforts - very plodding plot, and pretty [weak] most of the way. I often put the book down for days on end, with little desire to get back to it! That is very atypical of me when I am reading a well-crafted thriller. This is a legal hackpiece that is hardly worth the effort."
2,Uneven,"With Steve Martini's The Arraignment, I found a very uneven mystery. The characters seem flat and shallow, although maybe you have to read from the beginning of the Paul Madriani series to get more background on recurring characters. The writing seems rather bland and dry. Some parts were very predictable and I figured out the villan halfway through the book (something I don't usually do). The first half of the book showed great promise, and then proceeded to sink with each successive page. The plot was very convoluted, and even at the end when things were somewhat explained, it still seemed totally unbelievable. Too many questions were left unanswered and the entire plot didn't make sense. As someone who reads dozens and dozens of mysteries every year, I wasn't impressed with Mr. Martini."
4,Paul Madriani is back!,In this compelling legal thriller Paul must find out who killed his friend on city streets. Madriani is one tough lawyer and his friends murder left up to him will not be unsolved. He will encounter many dangerous characters including people who murder for money. What can I say I love all of Paul Madriani series. He's always in the middle of a mystery. This was definetely a page turner.
4,Average,"See storyline above.Though I usually really like a Martini, this one did not mix as well as his previous works. It didn't have the smooth flow I'm used to. The story was good and overall easy to read, but it just didn't have the catch I really like. Maybe next time."
2,Like Martini - but this one was weak,"As others have mentioned, Martini does a good job bringing the reader along but starts to lose grip of the story and the reader when he goes to Mexico. I can't recall an ending like that ever. It's like he didn't know how to conclude it properly, so he just had to explain everything at the end without incorporating it into the plot. It was easy enough to know Tolt was a bad guy, but you can't save all the facts for the last page or two. Just very disappointing and not worth the read I'm afraid."
3,"Not Bad, But ....","I had high expectations for this book. I have enjoyed others by this author. However, I had to force myself to keep plodding through a cast of unsympathetic characters, little emotional depth, and an ending I guessed early in the book. I kept reading thinking it must get better. There were a few intriging chapters, but only a few.The ending was not satisfying, there were many unresolved, disjointed story lines. I still give it three stars because Martini is a good author, this is just average work when compared with his other novels."
3,The Arraignment,"This story starts off a little slow. You get to know the characters and get a feel for the setting. It is all based around this lawyer named Nick who gets killed. And how his friend Paul Madrini tries to help find out who did this. He gets into a couple of difficult situations in between.Paul has to go through a whole bunch of people to find out all the missing links of the murder. He has to deal with insurance companies and Nick's wives. Both his ex wife and his widowed wife. You have to sit tight and make it through the beginning chapters before the story really starts to pick up.Once you start getting towards the end of this book the story starts to move at a very quick pase. When in the beginning you wanted to just put the book aside, but now yo0u can't put it down. There are some pretty crazy action scenes towards the and then it happens. You find out who killed Nick and all the other guys and boy does it surprise you."
2,Boring,"This book was highly recommended but I was totally disappointed. It started out okay but then got boring. There was no character in the book that I cared about or frankly, how the story ended. It went 100 pages way to long. It was dragged out, to wordy. Not sure I would read his books again. After reading just a few pages, I would fall asleep. Found this book to be a great cure for insomnia.I have read better murder mysteries."
3,Lawyers as Action Guys,"This was my first Steve Martini book and I listened to the audio version. The audio is an abridged version so I am always a bit apprehensive as to what was left out.I found the story to be interesting and it moved quickly. It was OK for light entertainment which is what I listen to when I am on the road and need to stay awake.There were some technical errors concerning the weapons and their usage and the bad guys were really bad guys. I always have a little trouble with attorneys as action guys. I work with them all of the time (attorneys) and they are not very good as high speed low drag action oriented individuals.But, I would definitely read another Martini book with the protagonist Paul Madriani."
2,Not that great,"I picked up this paperback in the airport while my flight was delayed and had high hopes for it.Like most have already said, the first half of the book looked good, but fell apart at the end.This was the first book I have read by Mr. Martini and may be the last.If you like this sort of book, go for David Baldacci instead."
2,Legal thriller that misses the mark,"Heard the taped version of THE ARRAIGNMENT, a legal thrillerby Steve Martini . . . it again features a recurring character (defenseattorney Paul Madriani), yet this time there's more adventurethan courtroom drama--leaving me disappointed . . . also,the plot was overly convoluted . . . it starts off with the murderof a friend on a crowded city street and winds up on a questfrom California to the jungles of Mexico . . . the only savinggrace for me was in the fact that Joe Mantegna's reading wasexcellent."
2,not for bigger framed individuals,"it seemed to sit on my wrist bone quite uncomfortably. I asked my friend, who cuts lawns, about it and he loves it. His frame is quite a bit smaller than mine, though."
4,Great product,"This is a high-quality kitchen tool. It's expensive but you get much better performance than lower-cost food mills. Not to say that a cheaper one won't do the job, but it may take longer, require more elbow grease, and clog up more. If you're only an occasional user, maybe you don't need it. But if you do preserving/canning, make soups or sauces, etc., on a regular basis, you might find this is well worth the money.The only thing that knocks a star off my rating here is the plastic clip that hold the grate in place. It seems cheap and easily lost or broken. It doesn't affect the performance at all but it sure seems like they could have come up with a better solution than what looks like a plastic hair clip."
3,Need to Make Individual Parts Available for Purchase.,"I like this food mill except for the fact that the little clip thing on the bottom isn't made to seem so essential! Somehow the last time I used the old mill, we lost the little clip thing. I tried to purchase that clip part but there isn't anyway that Cuisipro allows you to do this so it is a real bummer. I had to purchase and entire new system because they don't offer parts. (Besides being very small it is made of plastic so it could become damaged or broken.) Cuisipro needs to make parts so that we can purchase them individually because the rest of the food mill is very sturdy and nice. Now I have two mills but just one clip. Sort of a rip off in my opinion and Cuisipro needs to have a customer service line or something so you can order this part individually. If they don't start doing that, this is the last time I will order that food mill and I'm disappointed with the company. If it wasn't for this I would have given it a 5 Star rating."
3,Review of food mill,"I bought this because of the review from America's Test Kitchen. It works as promised, but it's too much food mill for my kitchen. I now wish I had purchased something smaller. This is great for professional kitchens, people who cook a lot of food, or someone who has to have restaurant-grade everything. However, if you're like me (a regular cook) you'll do better to get something smaller and less expensive."
3,Pricey for the Product Results,"I tried the mill right after it arrived. To be honest the scraper is worthless. It's easier to use a spatula and more effective. The grind seem fine enough and I like the ease of assembly. Now the real proving ground to me will be in the longevity of sharpness and how well it works for other projects, but for the money I was a little disappointed."
2,Flimsy,"I have the previous version of this food mill by Cuisipro, I've used that one for a little over 1 year and the knob on top has already popped off and it is impossible to get it to stay on anymore. It looks like they changed the knob design since then but I would still stay away from this brand. I was expecting this food mill to last much longer considering the cost."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought the mill to make sauces and mash potatoes. It looks good and well made on the surface, but has ridiculous design flaws. When you turn the mill, the knob unscrews no matter what you do, so that you have to constantly screw it back on while you are trying to grind the food. This makes it virtually unsuable. Not only that, but the blades do not gather up the food, so that you have to constantly feed the food into the blade. For such an expensive item to be this poorly designed is unconscionable. I then tried another one with the Bed, Bath, and Beyond label, $50 cheaper. The knob didn't screw off, but still the blades did not grind the food. I'm going to stick with a regular food processor and an old-fashioned hand potato masher. I'm fed up with food mills."
2,Knob Unscrews--Frustrating,For the price this food mill is a frustrating piece of poor engineering. Cuisipro missed the mark. I have to spin the knob back down when using it every few turns or it will unscrew and come off. Not real efficient when working with hot food and potentially dangerous.
5,High Quality Food Mill,Really was very pleasantly surprise by the weight and quality of this food mill. It works terrific. We have a pomegrante tree and it was delightful to get the juice out of the fruit with such ease. There are a lot of food preparation items which we can envision being pureed with this product. Stainless steel made with high quality perfection!
4,Tiny Euroface,"It's quite a nice product, but is really small for a standar room. I'll have to buy a bigger bulb."
5,Wonderful family story!,I bought this book for my daughter since her grandmother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She and I both read Trudy together and fell in love with the story-especially the main character. I felt that the portrayal of Alzheimer's was accurate and honest. I'd definitely recommend Trudy to children and adults who are dealing with illness or who are looking for a beautiful written story.
4,Trudy,"A thoughtful first novel about a young girl who has problems at school and is also coping with elderly parents, one of whom develops altzheimers. Good material for PHSE in school - and chapters can be isolated to discuss different issues. A favourite read with mature 5th grade girls."
3,Just a plastic jar - needs magnifier,"I purchased this bug jar with a bug vaccuum for my son. I serves its purpose and contains bugs and has a breathable lid. But, it's just a simple plastic jar. I wish it had some type of magnifying lens so he could see the bugs up close. It also comes with a plastic praying mantis bug in it. My son thought that was cool and thought the bugs he caught would be scared by it."
2,Best Ever Bug Jar Review,"I was disappointed with this bug jar from the beginning. The green handle comes off quite easily and often. It goes back on but will not stay due to it being cheaply made. If the handle stayed on all the time, my kids and I would love it."
1,mr,"I am unable to install the product on my computer.The disc that was sent with the product is not loading, and the computer is unable to locate the drivers. I need to know how I can have this problem resolved, and get the product working."
1,WARNING! Not compatible with Windows Vista!,"According to Sima's technical assistance line, this product is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS VISTA. There is no fix, patch, etc."
2,NEED A REFUND,"I returned this item for a refund, I thought I was ordering th CT-2 model---- I received an email from amazon that they received the item back and would issue me a refund, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REFUND YET , IT'S BEEN ABOUT A MONTH . WHAT HAPPENED ???"
1,does this work? does sima still make copy devices like the one I bought at best buy a few years back?,you simply plug in a scable or yellow rca jack in the input and use the end from the output to a stand alone dvd burner and I was able to record most things. It helped take out the copyprotection etc. Some disc/ even vhs 's were to protecte to copy or my machine went out. it' only lasted about two years. This seems like a differnt model.anyone ever get the refunds ? thanks for your feedback or answer's to getting around the copy protection thanks.
2,The low side of Howe,"S.H. did not record any solo albums in the 80's, after 2 in the 70's. Then he did one instrumental album and this one. The early 90's were a tough time for most bands and artists -(whose early 90's albums rate high among their previous and future work?..) So, this is true for this album - unspectacular songs, not much great playing, and a weird, cheap sound to the whole thing. Interesting, but not very good."
2,Same Program from 2003,"Don't get me wrong, it's a great program, so when I saw that they were releasing a new version on April 1, 2012 I immediately pre-ordered it. Turns out, the only update is a new cover photo. If you already have this, don't buy the new version. If you don't already have it, then get it--and use it along with GTD to really get the right things done."
4,Focus: Achieving Your Highest Priorities,"Good content, helps to have a background in the Franklin Covey system."
4,Its really good except for 1 track.,"Most of the songs are excellent, the only one I have a problem with is ""You can't hide"" I am sorry but this song is the worst song I have ever heard, but I don't blame Jade or Sweetbox for this the person who wrote this horrible song should be shot. I got this album like a lot did because of Final Fantasy X-2. My favorite song is ""Real Emotion"". I love its upbeat tempo. Other than the one song I would give this album a 4.5 out of 5 stars. If Jade keeps going like she is she could easily overtake the Britney's and Christina's in the industry."
5,Love this product,"I love this album by Sweetbox. Perhaps one of the band's greatest of all-time. Tracks like ""Lacrimosa"", ""Liberty"", and of course the full versions of ""1000 Words"" and ""real Emotion"" are real catchy and are tear jerkers, especially ""1000 Words"". I highly recommend you buy this CD as soon as possible.Kevin R."
4,If you like mystery & Ancient Egypt this is a fine choice,"Huy had been a scribe during Akhenaten's reign. He survived the bitter return to the old ways, gods & a new pharoah's reign under the yoke of rivals Horemheb & Ay, but at the cost of his profession. Unable to live by previous means he is 'unofficially' asked by a Medjay policeman to assist in solving the mysterious deaths of young beautiful girls.The deaths are due to unknown cause & pressure mounts to find the guilty party(ies) quickly. Huy uses keen observation, commonsense, contacts and instinct to probe the frightening murders.The author sets the mood & period very capably. Dialogue & descriptions are very readable & are void of distracting 'modernisms' & comparisons.While not a 'classic', it is a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon distraction & a pleasure to read."
3,Does not work in DVD player,"For some reason this DVD did not work in my DVD player. It didn't work in the 7 others I used either. But it does work on my laptop. It is a wicked silly DVD, especially when David Bowie is miming. Classic."
4,From Long time ago...,"From Long time ago... this is the last album where we can find the colaboration of Jeff Porcaro. Also, from several years (10??)that we didnt know anyting about TOTO, this is the return of one of the best rock bands."
5,A good opportunity for Steve Lukather,"Steve Lukather, the guitarist of the group Toto, hasn't had any real occasion to show his talent during these 15 years in the band. But we must admit that Toto wasn't an hard rock band, so there wasn't any room for guitar riffs. So this is the occasion for him to express himself, on both guitar and vocals.4 singers have been in Toto from 1977 to 1992, but I'll give you a honest opinion : none of them were -to me- as talented as Steve Lukather. He has a great emotional and strong voice.And this album is huge change in Toto's carrier. You can forget the past pop albums; this one is hard rock.The main highlights are two great ballads ""Don't chain my heart"", ""2 hearts"", two great rock songs ""gypsy train"", ""never enough"" and the tribute to Jeff Porcaro ""wings of time"", the drummer who recently died."
1,The Worst Toto album,I'm a Toto fan so I can say without hesitation that this is clearly the worst Toto album. It sounds as if they were trying to fulfill a record contract - too many unforgettable filler songs. Avoid this one!!
2,The other perspective,"If you are in the group of fans who thought that Toto IV through The Seventh One produced some of the most airtight performances on the planet (and I'll throw out ""Waiting For Your Love"" and ""You Got Me"" as examples), then I strongly advise you sample whatever sounds you can from ""Kingdom of Desire"" before purchasing. When I first put it on I thought I was listening to any one of a dozen early 80's rock bands. I warmed up to it a little at around the 8th track - there is some nice work from this point on, and there is plenty of good material for David Paich fans on this cd.In my humble opinion, Toto are one of the most talented groups ever assembled (in any of their incarnations) but I wasn't thrilled with the Rock direction they took on this album. It seems almost like a step backwards for them."
5,Gift,This is my daughters favorite perfume! She loves it! It was a gift to her.This was a gift my daughter love it!!!!Can't say anymore!
5,kool,this cd is so kool i really like it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i think it is some good punk music !!!!!!!!! so if you don't have it go get it now1!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,This is for absolutely beginners only,"If you are an absolute beginner and need to begin from a chair, then this DVD will have some useful information for you. Having said that, I need to say that I was disappointed in the content, as I am a certified yoga instructor and was looking for some fresh ideas for chair yoga since I teach this, as well as floor yoga, on a regular basis. The problem, as I see it, is not so much with the DVD as with its description. If the description had said this DVD is for beginners only, I would not have purchased it, and therein lies my dissatisfaction. It was also my understanding that this comes with a book. It does not. You get the DVD with some simple instructions, and that's it."
1,Disappointment,"Total disappointment. Wish there had been more of a preview availabe so I could have saved my money, I was looking for something that mimiced full yoga poses, modified to chair."
1,Very Uninspired,"This DVD was a total disappointment and contains very little information. The two very short sequences that are uninspired and then broken down step by step to total the ""100"" minutes. Get another one! Liked ageless yoga."
1,For Total Beginners Only,"I am a yoga teacher with 20 years experience; but after a prolonged illness then a foot injury, I ended up off my mat for 2 years. I was looking for a seated practice that would support me in easing back into poses. This DVD did not do that. It is appropriate for *total* beginners only. Each of the two classes lasts only 10 minutes and is so basic that it really only hints at asana. Several minutes on each are dedicated to *very* simple breathing. One class spends 2-3 minutes on meridian tapping in the hands that is more like qigong than yoga. The majority of the DVD is spent on the instruction segments (35 minutes for each class), again aimed toward total beginners. I found the instruction uninspired. This DVD might be appropriate for someone who has never done any yoga and whose mobility is significantly to extremely limited."
3,A couple great the rest not so much.,"It's tough to review an album like this since it's completely subjective. I bought this album for 1 song, Here There and Everywhere to use for my wedding. I wanted to legally obtain a copy and I did that. However, I personally did not enjoy the rest of the cover which makes it hard to rate the album as a whole.Here There and Everywhere by Belarus is an incredible cover and in my case made the purchase worthwhile, but in my opinion the rest of the songs were just yet another attempt at Beatles covers."
3,REVOLVER RELOADED,"Taxman (Catfish Haven), Eleanor Rigby (Handsome Family with The Rivet Gang), I'm Only Sleeping (Neal Casal), Love You To (Sukilove), Here There And Everywhere (Belarus), Yellow Submarine (Chris Eckman), She Said She Said (Mark Mulcahy), Good Day Sunshine (Lampshade), And Your Bird can Sing (Jim Reid), For No One (Michael Weston King), Doctor Robert (Luke Temple), I Want To Tell You (Thea Gilmore), Got To Get You Into My Life (Green Pajamas), Tomorrow Never Knows (Jason McNiff), Rain (Ed Harcourt)."
5,The hottest of Mic Geronimo,"This is personally without a doubt Mic Geronimo's best album. Real fresh lyrics and totally on top production. I really suggest this if you're a hip-hop fan. Also, this album introduces the one and only Royal Flush in which would be a good collection if you peeped his Ghetto Millionaire first somehow.But, as much as Mic Geronimo proved how good he could be in this album, collaborating with Jay-Z (whom personally I ain't a fan of) just shows that he's been quickly going into mainstream and not only that, but falling from his popularity. No personal remarks based on.If you enjoyed this album like I have, peep Vendetta. But, that would have probably be it unless the Masta I.C. starts to bring back that real hip-hop feel."
4,4.5 stars,"Mic Geronimo first LP is tight. The beats are tight, the rhymes are tight but it lacks something that makes it a classic. ""Whenever you are"", ""Masta I.C."" and ""Men vs. many"" are three very good songs and the others are good too. This album is before that Puffy-watered-down bullcrap that MIC did on his sophomore effort 'Vendetta'. [Forget] a second album! This is the real dope from one of Queens finest. 4.5 stars."
4,A Great One to Read and Reread and Reread,"I have always loved Madeleine L'Engle. I started reading her books when I was about ten and still go back to them now (I'm 20). I love her no-nonsense take on love and how hard life can be. I love that she doesn't hold it back just because her readers are young.This book especially has always been one I come back to. Flip's story is totally compelling. I wanted to have a dashing and mysterious friend like Paul when I first read this (indeed, when I read it now!). This is a good one to read on a rainy day."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book very much, but I liked ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" and ""Zia"" more. I think those are L'Engle's best books (she did write them, didn't she??) Unlike the other reader, I found the beginning to be slow, actually, the whole book. But it was good nonetheless. Now I have to go write a report on it! :0) I just came here for an idea of the theme. I think that knowing you're not alone can help a great deal."
5,wonderful,Madeleine L'engle does it again! She has written a book that all can relate to. I liked it b/c it took place in a diff. country and had to do with all kinds of diff. things. I could really relate to Flip. GO READ IT NOW!!
5,Just As Wonderful on the Third Read!,"As an avid fan of Ms. L'Engle, I have read and re-read many of her titles. This one is a particular favorite. I especially recommend this book to any pre-teen/teen girl who is having trouble finding a place to fit in the world. Flip is a character you will care deeply about as she struggles to adjust to life at a Swiss boarding school after the death of her mother. She finds friendship in the school's art teacher, Madame Perceval and Paul, a boy without a past or identity. Experiences with these memorable characters teach her that she can be happy if she puts forth the effort. I just finished it for the third time and it remains high on my list."
4,Sweet,"My daughter, 13 , enjoyed he book and the love story. The setting was great and so was the story. It kept her reading and that's always a plus."
4,A band that deserves to be famous but probably won't be...,"I don't really understand why this video exists or what it was intended to be... the Charms are a fantastic but unknown rock band, with no real monumental story here, (at least not on the scale of the ""Dig"" documentary of Brian Jonestown Massacre""). I loved the video cause I'm a big fan of the band, and it was great to learn more about them, but I can't help but think that the market is pretty small. They should come out with a live concert performance video... I'd buy that!!"
1,Smell is Sickening - Threw Away After Using Once,"I picked these up at my local heath food store, thinking that if they sold them at the health food store they must be good. However, they had an overpowering flowery smell that made me downright sick. The smell was so bad and so powerful that I had to immediately go over the surface I had cleaned with another cleaning product to get rid of the smell of these wipes. The only people who I could imagine liking these are those who like really heavy, flowery perfumes. Not me. After using just two wipes, I threw away the whole package. Getting my money's worth from the package was not worth the headache they gave me."
5,Nice Murder Mystery!,"I really enjoyed the adventures of Caroll Davenport and the turns and twists of ""who done it"". Nicely written and great book to read on vacation or a wintery day. I picked up Wanda Canada's first book in the series, Island Murders, in a book store while on vacation in South Carolina and it made me want to read more about the characters adventures. I am waiting for the third in the series."
5,AND IT GO'S ON,"CARROLL DAVENPORT IS A GREAT CHARACTER. THIS BOOK TAKES OFF AND NEVER STOPS, I LOOK FORWARD TO HER NEXT BOOK. IT IS A GREAT READ AND VERY FAST."
4,Memories of Wilmington,"I enjoyed my first experience with a Wanda Canada novel, Cape Fear Murders. Having lived in Wimington, it took me through familiar streets to some of my favorite memories of that gorgeous city. I look forward to reading more Canada!"
5,Can't wait for a return visit to Lambert!!!,"I know this was supposed to be the last book in the Lambert series but I, for one, hope there will be a few more visits. I really enjoyed following Nouri and others from book to book. I. like most of this writer's many fans was sad to see this series end. I'm hoping Ms. Murray will change her mind and write a few more books in another week of the life of Nouri St. Charles Sommers from Boston!!!"
5,I Want More!,"I read the first 3 in the Lambert series,along with my on-line book discussion group, but could not wait for the others to catch up, and went ahead with #4, whic I read in one night. That's how good it was. What's next, Ms. Murray? I want more! This is one fantastic series that will keep you entertained throughout! I am a huge fan!"
1,poor book,"I have ordered many many things on Amazon, but this is my first time ever to write a review. I ordered this book because it had very good reviews (like 165 5 star out of 167 total). So I thought it must be good and since I like mysteries I should enjoy it. I was surprised how much the reviews can be missleading! This book is all about sex and alcohol. Yes, there is nothing wrong with those two, but everybody sleeps with everyone (at the same time) and everybody is getting drunk all the time. Nothing deep or tuchy. The author uses the same words and expressions throughout all the book. Boring, not a pinch of excitment in this book and I couldn't find where the mystery was??? This book is like a very very bad soap opera."
5,"The colorful characters are sizzling,","I had so much fun with the LAMBERT series by talented writer Victoria Taylor Murray. Like most of this writer's many fans, I, too, was sorry to see it come to a close. Maybe Ms. Murray will do us all a favor and bring Nouri, Gabe, Charles, Clint, Mai Li, and others back again. I'd really like that! The Lambert series by Victoria Taylor Murray is a must read set of 4 books that will leave the reader begging for more, more, more! Get your 4 book set today! You'll be glad you did."
5,I'm such a LAMBERT fan!!!,"The reason I read stories like this one is because they sweep me away from the same ol' same ol' of everyday life! My one true passion in life is books like Le Fin. This writer is great! I enjoy her unique style of story-telling. Her characters are believable, fun, hot and exciting. Her plots are edge of your seat during the reading of the entire book, and her dialogue carries me contentedly through the whole book. I think I must have devoured this book in record time! I look forward to Ms. Murray's next offering or passion and romance with an edge!"
5,Why does it have to end here?,"Darn, I finally find a romantic suspense series that I was really getting into and then it stops! BUMMER! Hope Ms. Murray changes her mind and brings the Lambert series back again real soon!!!"
1,"Very, Very Disappointed",Nouri and Gabe are no Scarlett and Rhett. I couldn't even finish their story or get a good grasp on their personalities for all the grammar and mistakes in this book. I don't think it was edited at all.
5,Romantic Mystery I Couldn't Put Down !!!,"The Lambert Series consisting of; ""Thief of Hearts, Frobidden, Friendly Enemies & Le Fin,' is intriguing and fun to read. What a unique combination of characters and situations! I was on the edge of my seat until the very end of the on going soap had come to an end. Highly recommended and I look forward to reading more novels by this writer in the near future! (Love your stories Ms. Murray, I've become a fan!)"
5,Will true love prevail?,"The last book in this series is the best! All the questions the loyal LAMBERT fans have been asking themselves all along about Nouri and Gabe, Nouri and Charles, and Nouri and Clint, surrounding the triangle of star-crossed lovers will be answered. All loose ends are tied up in a nice little package and the ending will surprise everyone. Terrific ending to a terrific series! I can hardly wait to see what Ms. `Murray comes out with next!"
5,As promised by this writer early on...,As promised by this writer early on this series had an ending I simply could not imagine and you know what? I just loved it! I hope Ms. Murray hurrys up with her next book whether or not it is a series doesn't matter to me I just love her style! 2 thumbs up for The Lambert Series!
5,Murray is tops in my book!,"Ms. Murray does a masterful job of building suspense and she's a wiz at creating believable, unforgettable characters!"
5,Loved It!,"I just finished this today, and it was the first book I read by this author, but it certainly won't be the last. I wonder how she even thought of such a good southern name as ""Della Boyd Biddle"", and in true southern tradition, she was almost always addressed as ""Della Boyd"". Catherine was delightful with her outspoken ""all about me"" persona. Then there were Eldeen, and Hardy, and the twins, all such unique and well developed characters. I loved the characters, and the story."
4,I Loved This Book!!!,Alot of people find Jamie's books hard to read but of all of them this one flowed the best. She got to the point and I really cared about the characters. I was so happy to see all my favorites especially Magaret(Some Wildflower in My heart) and of course Eldeen. Jamie's books always make me remember God's grace and how He can work on the coldest hearts. I recommend this book.
5,great movie for school,"My students mentioned this to me when I began teaching my first year. They had watched this, or at least they got to sing the song 'Follow the Drinking Gourd', and it was my only request from them. Wow, was it a hit! We watched this during Black History Month, and it went perfectly along with our lessons. It makes the underground railroad concept more real to them, and they love singing the song. I would suggest this for any music teacher, or classroom teacher- this brings up so many teachable moments. I also recommend the book that goes along with it!"
4,Another Good Bechet Disc.,"This is a good Bechet disc, again featuring some longer tracks of over 4 mins. duration. Worth having."
5,sounds like a younger Fischer-Dieskau,"This album of Finnish folk songs is amazing. I had not heard of Gabriel Suovanen before I listened to this cd, but at only twenty-six years old, he has a lot of potential. His voice sounds very much like a younger Fischer-Dieskau. Some of the repertoire is not my favorite, but extremely enjoyable to listen to because of Suovanen's beautiful voice. The Sibelius songs are definitely the highlight of the album."
3,Don't buy it for the beautiful maps,"I'm not sure where the other poster is saying is illegal trail...Maybe he should have said?The chosen routes are good and cover basic to advanced (although much more intermediate/advanced aerobic/technical, as that's what Santa Cruz has to offer).The maps themselves suck. Looks like GPS waypoints over blurry pictures of another map with poorly rendered red and blue squiggles.If you are looking for step-by-step recommended rides, head this way. If you think you'll get lost, bring another map."
1,BIKERS BEWARE,Some bike trails in the Santa Cruz mntns that are touted are ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. The sheriff WILL BE CALLED. Your transportation vehicle WILL BE TOWED/CITED. You will be subject to TRESPASS LAW. Don't ruin your weekend
4,Pretty good.,"Hardly anyone without jazz afficion knows about Nick Brignola and his baritone sax, but he's worthy of note. The touchstone in baritone sax jazz has, justifiably, been Gerry Mulligan who makes a baritone sound like it ought to, a big beast of an instrument, huffing away. Mulligan lacks nothing in the way of technique or inspiration.Brignola, however, approaches the instrument as just another saxophone. His touch is lighter. And he isn't given to counterpoint. I first heard him on an NYC jazz station about ten years ago, his version of ""Star Eyes"", and I wondered who IS this guy. The tempo was fast, and Brignola threw away little pieces of the melody that could have been milked for sentiment.He's got a first-rate percussionist on this album. ""Poinciana"" demonstrates his range and is, alone, worth the price of admission.Well worth adding to your collection."
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get a book with sugar-substitutes however I was incredibly disappointed when they almost exclusively used ""equal"" or granulated frutose. I only found a handful of recipes that used natural sweetners (like juice concentrates).I understand that fructose does not raise blood sugar as quickly however it is just as bad as sucrose which I am trying to avoid in my diet.I would recommend this for diabetics only; for those that are thinking about buying this book for a life-style change and desiring to eat healthier, try ""Feeding Your Family"" by Cynthia Lair. She actually gives natural sugar-subsitutes and offers a great about of recipes for a healthy life-style."
2,Not as great as the reviews say,"I just wanted to lend another perspective to the reviews written here for this book because I bought this book based on those reviews and was very disappointed. The majority of the recipes call for sugar substitutes such as Sugar Twin or Equal, which is okay, but I was expecting more recipes involving natural sweeteners, like juices. A lot of the recipes are not really recipes - for example, fruit jam roll-ups are simply refrigerated crescent rolls with no-sugar jam and nuts - wow, I needed a recipe book for that? Also, the recipe instructions are annoyingly vague - I can make up my own recipe and estimate and correct for, but when I purchase a cookbook, I expect exact and detailed measurements and instructions. Overall, it certainly isn't a 5-star book, and I just wanted to write this review so other people thinking of buying this book would not be disappointed when they got it and tried the recipes. I wish I would have looked for a Splenda cookbook instead."
2,No sugar - but lots of white flour,"I was disappointed that most of these recipes still use refined white flour or cake flour. These refined carbohydrates can spike blood sugar too, just like sugar does. Probably the only recipes I'll be able to use are the ones for custards, etc."
1,Loaded with White Flour!,I was shocked this cookbook was loaded with white flour in most of the recipes. We all know that white flour turns to sugar and spikes your blood sugar. Very disappointed in this cookbook. I haven't made 1 recipe because of the white flour. I'm getting rid of this cookbook.
5,Arleen Auger and Dalton Baldwin-Love Songs,"A lovely collection -very varied. Arleen Auger has a beautiful voice and Baldwin's accompaniment is wonderful. The 3rd track, by Jayme Ovalle, is, as it says in the accompanying notes, bewitching, and is actually the reason I bought the CD."
5,A Slash Across the Cultural Vein,"In this early collection of mainstream fiction, Harlan Ellison looks at the violent subculture of the punk, the addict, any person who finds themselves of the underside of life. Mr. Ellison has gone underground as a member of a street gang, among other jobs, and his experiences ring through in every story. HE pulls no punches, and the cumulative effect brings a truth to these urban fables."
3,CANNOT BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE,"I have read all of this book a number of times. It is highly mixed concerning the accuracy and honesty of its contents. The article on Slavery, for instance, does say that Torah discourages Jew by Jew enslavement for debts unpaid.Then the unmentioned: Torah (Books of Moses) specifically permits enslavement of non-Jew by Jew. Later (Circa time of Jesus) Jewish Law prohibited giving freedom to a non-Jewish slave. This is informative if one appreciates the concept ""Chosen"" as having ethical meaning Jews are chosen, others not. If one appreciates this, one has gone the first step to understanding. The first reviewer, as a religious teacher in Christian Church, states that he uses this text as an information source. For this purpose it is highly inadequate. The text is part factual, but at least as great a part propaganda. If it gets anyone to read Spinoza, the author of the modern world, it is worth it."
3,Garage door carriage,"Product is great price compared to Sears and you don't get fleeced with shipping charges. However, product is poorly designed for working with a steel screw drive garage door opener. Not their fault. You just as well order 2 or more because shipping is the same cost as one and the new one will fail soon enough."
2,LIftmaster carriage,"Replacement part for much less than Sears or a local garage door retailer would charge. Sears is around $20, a local garage shop actually asked $45. I always order two now at a time. The installation is very simple, I would estimate 15-20 minutes and definitely doable for anyone with basic mechanical skills.The problem as other reviewers have stated is with the design. The carriage should be made out of brass to extend its service life. In the plastic version I am changing the carriages out every 2-3 years as a preventive maintenance step even before they fail (you should expect them to fail after 3 years under normal use, better to do it before the door comes crashing down)."
5,"High quality part, low cost",I bought this part to replace an old used up part and it fit right in and started working like what it was designed to do. I'm pleased with the over all product including shipping.
5,Great Blu-Ray Player,"I just picked up this model a few weeks ago, and so far I'm very impressed. Standard dvds look amazing and Blu-rays look absolutely stunning. I've read some complaints about the audio options, but I don't know what that's about. I have it hooked up through digital optical and multi-channel, and the sound is phenominal. Also, the setup menu options are very user friendly. I don't know why more people aren't buying this model. There's my 2 cents."
1,Won't play my Blue Ray discs,"I bought this player in June, I did not get a 1080p tv until Dec. The player plays my regular dvd's fine but when I tried a couple of blue ray discs I discovered. 1.The third Pirates Of The Carribien movie would only play the previews and the bonus disc, and 2.The third Resident Evil movie will not play at all. I called Phillips customer care and they sent me another player ( this took 10 days ). The replacement acted exactly the same as the first. After another call to Phillips I was finally told that this was a known problem and they would be getting back to me in a day or 2. I am still waiting for them to resolve the problem."
1,Won't Play Some Discs,"For the money, I am pretty disappointed that this player will not play some discs. The discs are brand new, but shows like Weeds simply will not play. I signed up for Blockbuster to get blue-ray discs in the mail, but canceled the membership when the admittedly roughly handled discs would skip or lock up. Very unsatisfied."
2,Bogus Sale,"I never could get this product to play my Blu Ray discs. It plays my regular DVD's just fine, but for Blu Ray, I would recomend something better."
1,Beware,"All current Blu-ray players are not capable of firmware upgrades, BR playersare not capable of of a lot of special features that HD-DVD is capable of, look at the announcement of the HD-DVD for Blood Diamond and compare it to the BR version. BR players are not worth it right now, starting in Nov BR players will have online and will be able to compete better with HD-DVD."
2,Not up to standard,THE SHIRT IS VERY THIN AND TO ME KIND OF FLIMSY. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A THICKER MATERIAL. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.
2,Buy her foreign language releases instead of this one,"Here's another Sony release marketed to the young American audience, who is already going deaf from the repetitious beat of pop/rock. It hurts to see such fantastic talent as Lara Fabian mismarketed so sadly. Buy her foreign language recordings to really hear what a tremendously passionate performer she can be. There is no better singer on the international stage today."
5,Amazing album!,"The second Lara Fabian's english album have a lot of beautiful songs! I don't understnd why it's so eclipsed by the first one... ""Conquered"", ""Silence"", ""I Guess I Loved You""... they're quite inspiring."
3,lara fabian is back,"i purchased A Wonderful Life in hopes of getting that chill down my spine everytime i heard Lara sing Your Not From Here or Adagiolike i did on her 2000 album.although her voice is spectacular as usual,I didn't get that chill on any of her songs on her new album.none of that deep powerful voice of hers and was a little dissapointed.but the music is fair and her voice is as always fantastic.the album is still a must purchase if your a fan at all of her music...you cant go wrong...love you lara"
5,Solid Adult Pop,"Lara's sophomore Eglish-language album may not have a single as successful as ""I Will Love Again"", however, ""Wonderful Life"" far exceeds my excepations. There is not a unpleasant song here. Her vocals are on point and the lryics suite her voice. The first single ""The Last Goodbye"" has wrongly been overlooked by radio, but is one of the many stellar proformances of this album. This is a vertually flawless album which is perfect for any Adult Contemporary fan. Other tracks worth mentioning are ""No Big Deal"", ""Conquered"", ""Intoxicated"", ""I Am"", ""Walk Away"" and ""I Guess I Loved You."" If you are a fan of this style of music, get this album!"
3,Learn to speak better English,"If Lara ever wants to be as big as Celine or other singers in the same venue, she should learn to speak better English. I can hear sounds from her songs but can't hardly understand anything she sings. There are a lot of people wanted her to succeed. Bad enough to have her first English album repackaged (with a color picture cover) and re-issued when it was not selling with the original black and white cover. She also sings duets with just about anybody (Richard Marx, Josh Grobin etc..) but stardom will elude her the way she is now. The new album is really quite ordinary."
4,Best cat litter I've used,"Ever Clean is the best cat litter I've used - between switching to a high-quality cat food and using this litter, you wouldn't even know I have cats."
2,Clay just isn't good no matter how prestige.,"I tried this litter and it was supposedly the best out of all clay litters, my problem is even for the cost, it doesn't do very well with odor. Your home will smell like litter all day. I will admit, I am not a fan of clay litters as they are much too dusty. Natural pine and some corns are much better, I also recommend using some Dr. Eisley's Cat Attract temporarily on top of the litter if you want to transition your cat to natural litters."
3,Matches set well!,"This lamp matches the Starlight set well. It was a little rickety though. The shade seemed to tilt to one side. We were able to bend it a little so it isn't so noticeable. It is not the greatest quality for the price though. You could probably get something similar at a discount store and paint it to match. Overall, I am satisfied (mostely because it was a gift and I didn't have to pay for it)."
5,Beautiful lamp,"Yes, it's a little expensive, but it is SO hard to find any good green and yellow baby accessories. I love it and have had no problems with it."
5,Toward Healthy Aging: Human Needs and Nursing Response,Easy to read and understand and pertinent for the class that I am taking. This book arrived in pristine condition.
4,Sally,"Its fairly difficult to find a Sally - this is by far the easiest/cheapest way to satisfy the Sally fan in your household. I don't know if there's limited production or what, but they seem exceptionally rare in all stores we've hit.The paint chips pretty quickly when hit together with other cars, but the axles seems quite strong (have survived without a bend so far!). Like all other Cars from the series, they're slightly larger than typical matchbox-type cars with extra-wide wheels, making a lot of accessories/playsets you may already own not work.If you have a need for a Sally, I'd certainly recommend this set!"
1,Not a good Buy But Quality from the seller was great,This product was sent to me in great shape still in the package (NEW) but the first time my son rolled it and not hard i might add it hit my tv stand and most of the paint started chipping off but I know its not the sellers fault the blame lies with the company that made it and thier poor quality
3,Nice toys but too small sizes,"I had intended to buy one that is around 4'', but was misled by the seller on Amazon.com to order this smaller size. They measure only about 3''. If you are collecting those bigger ones this is not your best choice."
3,it leaks,"I got a first 1, it was empty.. then they change it... but it has like 1/2 of liquid !!it leaks in travels.. :/But still a excellent perfume !!"
5,Allah's Fire,"My dad flew airplanes and dropped bombs in WWII. I don't think he ever dropped any bombs but he got injured which is why he got a purple heart. That's why I thought he would like this book because it was about war. At first he said it was very complicated because of speaking of Allah and to many characters. However, he finished the book, which I didn't think he would. He told me it got better the more he read it. I'm not sure I will read it as it's not my kind of book. It arrived in perfect condition. I would buy from this seller again."
4,Action Packed,"This was pretty much a non-stop mover! The mid-east setting and focus on their culture was an eye-opener. I can't say I understand it much more now than before, but the author did a great job of portraying their inner motivations."
4,"a ""getting started with TINI"" book",Describes from a user's point of view how to use the TINI environment and board which Dallas Semiconductor has developed. This system utilizes a small Java system to make it rather easy for users to develop network attached sensors and adaptors. The book is quite readable and provides an excellent series of increasingly complex examples. This is the sort of book that should exist for every environment!
3,Didn't receive it.,Order was never received. Granted amazon gave me a complete refund but vendor was very slow to deliver and when the product did come it was the container for the brace but no brace. The box that it came in was not tampered with so someone shipped it knowing that this brace was not in the display container and of course they didn't have anymore in stock. I cannot review the product because I never received it but watch out for this vendor.
3,Like it BUT pain to put on...,"Ok I love Mossy Oak stuff. My hubby bought this for me to match the seat cover that he got for my birthday. Love that fact that it is cling ""adhesive"", however when I put it on my car (which I'm sure is older than most) it was too straight, is the best way to put it. It did fit the shape of the winshield. There was a gap everywhere except the middle. This is a nice looking product but make sure it fits your windshiel shape."
2,Well-written but inevitably lacking,"I ""saved"" this book for several years, thinking it would be another Rushdie book to savour. When I finally read it, I felt that it was mere journalism, OK, maybe well-written journalism, but.... I did not find the flavour of Central America (though I have never been to Nicaragua), but rather the observations of a keen mind in a situation that was quite unfamiliar. The resulting book, I fear, shows that unfamiliarity. I thought, ""Yes, Rushdie, from another Third World country with a certain style of contradiction, would understand Nicaragua and the revolutionary process with a special eye."" I think the latter (process) turned out to be largely true, but not the former (Nicaragua). I would recommend this book to all authors who might feel that they could produce an excellent book on a place they know little about. Travel writers are excused, because they write about travel, not necessarily deep insights. But a major novelist ? I thought it would be better."
4,nicaragua during the war,Rushdie provides a balanced view of the conditions in 1987 that coinside with my seminar work there in 1988. The 1997 preface to the original is helpful. He captured the sence of it.
4,"Book, subject even more so, deserves reevaluation","I just saw a film on present-day Nicaragua, a country that's no longer flavour of the month, at least as far as the world's press is concerned. It's been at least 15 years since I've read this book. I liked it fairly well then, and feel that, though Rushdie might have been a bit too kind to the Sandinistas (who deserve much of the criticism they received) the fact that Nicaragua was robbed blind by Somoza (who stole relief money for the earthquake that hit Managua in the 1970s)and, it seems, by the penultimate president, Aleman (convicted of financial wrongdoings but certainly not jailed)gives the Sandinistas' programs (redistribution of land,literacy, and the equal participation of women in Nicaraguan life)some credibility."
5,One of the best supernatural (scary) books ever written,"Granted I read this when I was 10, but this was scary like the Final Destination movies later turned out to be.A corpse in the morgue is somehow not real...until it turns out to be an apparition of what might be if someone gets on an airplane that is destined to crash...This is one heck of a scary book. I highly recommend it to all ghost story aficionados."
5,Highly recommend,Does a great job of cleaning and protecting my Hypalon tender. I have used it for several seasons and it looks like new.
5,Great for your Hands!!!,I originally purchased this product after hearing good results. I have very dry hands and this is the only lotion that will keep my hands moist and crack free. As for the shipper. they were very accomodating and fufilled all my requests. Will order from them again.
3,Nails,I have been using this but have not seen any strengthening of my nails. It is very soothing for my hands.
3,stranger than strange,"two years ago i purchased a small tube of mane and tail lotion from a local beauty supply place. the first time i used it the tube crumbled in my hand so i put the lotion in another container. a year ago i purchased the same size fromt the same place. the container, again, crumbled in my hand and the contents had to be put in another container. this time i thought perhaps if i bought on line, i'd get fresh packaging. i ordered 2 huge pump jars of the stuff. when it arrived, the lotion was all over the inside of the box because the lid to one of the plastic jars had cracked in several places and simply fell apart. good news is that amazon let me keep the good one and was happy and quick to give me a refund of the broken one. They also made it way easy to return it. end result- the lotion is like no other i've ever tried- truly incredible! the packaging? stranger than strange..."
5,The best Brazilian singer,"All his three albums are great. This one is full of passion and his lyrics make us think about ourselves. It's really worth it buying it. If you start listening to his music, you won't be able to stop."
1,Dumb,Nobody will ever pay this much for those resident evil games. i own every single resident evil game to date and i know that no one out there will pay this much. ur just ripping people off. specially when ur Resident evil 3 is missing the booklet. and ur resident evil 1 is a greatest hit edition. i have the original with booklets for all of mine. and people can find those anywhere and buy all for and only spend less than 60 bucks.
3,nice book but...,"The book was awesome but i thought i was buying a ""CD"" soundtrack due to the title of the product. So kinda disappointed about that."
2,Long and Cumbersome,"This is little more than an extended Griffiths. I gained very little from this book. Most likely you are buying this for a class, but you would be better off with Griffiths or maybe Sakuria."
3,A Grounded Review,"Let's be a little realistic. The other reviews of this book makeQuantum Mechanics sound easy with Shankar as your quide. This is NOT TRUE. To get anything out of Shankar you must spend hours reading and doing his problems. I'm sure compared to the other indecipherable tomes out there Shankar looks like a Godsend to the experts, but a student must still work hard to begin to understand QM. Shankar simply makes that work doable."
2,Needs 3rd edition!!,"I had this book for my first quarter of QM (undergrad level), and I had Griffiths for my 2nd quarter. If I had had Griffiths to start, I wouldn't have even opened this book. It is a very well rounded book, but not very good for an introductory text. The print/font made it impossible to try to find something when flipping through the pages. Quantum mechanics can be very interesting and intriguing if presented properly. This book did not. It was like reading the dictionary, whereas Griffiths or even Gasiorowicz was like a good novel: you wanted to keep going and learning more... This book is tedious. BUT it doesn't say ""Introductory"" in the title, so maybe my review would be higher if this had been my textbook after becoming familiar with the subject."
2,The Fine Print,"From the outside, this book appeared to be identical to that of my colleages. However, a quick glance inside immediately shows its inferior nature. The print quality is horrible. It is much less clear than the rough draft setting on my hp deskjet at home. In some instances, the fine print is rendered illegible. It is particularly problematic when flipping through the pages in reference or review. The fuzzy print makes it difficult or impossible to find what you're looking for without carefully reading the page. This unfortunate feature greatly diminishes the value of this otherwise excellent textbook."
2,Not great for first time QM students,I am taking a class that reviews QM but unfortunately I never took QM as an undergrad. So this book isn't very good if you are trying to get a comprehensive overview of QM. It seemed to have a lot of derivations and information though so if you are looking for a more in depth course this will probably help.
2,Shankar lacks empathy,"A 2 because one of the first lines state ""this book is selfcontained for someone with no knowledge of the subject and blah blah blah it should be readable and easy"" this book is mightly confusing and rather boring. Shankar's style is akin to trying to give someone directions in a totally strange land to a unknown place by waving their hands in the air and telling you which way to go. This type of thing may be fine if you're speaking to someone who knows the land--a professor of the subject maybe, but is flirting with confussion for a student. A 2 simpling because this might be a great book--once you know the subject."
2,Just Okay,"I got this book for undergrad because it had a perfect score back then and I needed something to help explain my required textbook. I admit it helped to a certain extent but not by much! However, in grad school it didn't really tell me anything new. The author I think over explains things, which depending on the subject in quantum can be needed but often times can be boring! While this author does try and explain a lot and I can't fault him for that this book gets a low rating because it fell apart on me in the middle of the semester and it fell apart on my fellow students too! Be forwarned that if you buy this book chances are pretty good that it will fall apart on you too! So while it may have a good intro and stuff this book is just destine to break apart. In retrospect, giving this book 2 stars may be generous!"
2,Warning Not For Those Who Are Struggling,I bought this book when I tried to learn QM by myself. I am not stupidand I know how to differentiate and to integrate but boy is this bookhard to understand. This is a book for people who already understandthe subject not for those who have major problems understanding it.If you have an IQ of 170 then this book is for you. If you are aroundthe 120-130 mark and have trouble with advanced math I recommend startingwith Linus Paulings - Introduction To Quantum Mechanics.You have been warned :)John
5,Awesome introduction to field using Dirac notation,"Shankar has produced a lucid examination into the field of quantum mechanics employing Dirac notation from the very beginning. His initial 80-page introductory chapter on the mathematical notation needed for quantum mechanics (inner-products, Hilbert spaces, Hermitian operators, etc.) is the best I've seen (and one of the only) written for the introductory student. Much better book than Gasiorowicz, Bohm, or others I've seen as introductions."
5,very probably the best QM text book.,This book is great for beginning graduate students ofphysics who wish to go beyond Griffith level of knowledge.Mathematically rigurous without boring you.It is well worth the effort to spend time with thisbook reading the physical explanations and doing theproblems. Because you will be awarded with the FEELINGthat you've got a SOLID undestanding of QM.Not only that. You will find yourself picking up this book from the bookshelf quite often even after years of having taken the course.
3,Super Reader,"It's all about the gold mine.When the Lone Ranger and Tonto find a young girl alone in the woods they soon determine she is in need of help.Given that some of the men causing her problems are named Tombstone, Ripper, Scar, and Mace, it isn't hard for our heroes to tell that there is more than a fair chance these gentlemen are of the 'not pleasant' and 'rather likely to be dishonest' persuasion.This certainly turns out to be the case, and a certain amount of escapology and gunplay is required.Said no-good varmints also learn the particular importance of literacy and good spelling.Also, of course :-A moment later the canyonwas in darkness and the sound of wild hoofswas dying away in the distance. Suddenly aclear voice rang out above all the othersounds of the night: ""Hi-Yo, Silver--away!""3 out of 5"
1,Doesn't fit bottle,The pump does not fit the 64 oz Torani pumpkin spice sauce container. The diameter of the lid is too small. I just threw it away.
5,La Noche de los Tiempos,"The english title for this masterpiece needs to be changed. I read this book in spanish as a kid and could never forget it. I re-read it countless times and always enjoyed it, I'd love to learn french to read it in its original language. You would not be disappointed."
5,Found a long lost friend,"I found this book in my junior high library, and even though I had never read any SF, I read it again and again, and have never forgotten it. Off and on over the years I have looked for it, never quite sure if I was even remembering the title correctly. When I decided to look for it at Amazon, I was worried that I would find it and that it would not live up to my memories (as books you read as a child often don't), but now that I have read all of the other reviews, I am dying to get my hands on it. It was beautiful and moving."
5,A Masterpiece !!,"I am french, and i also did read that book 10 years ago, and still can feel deep inside of me how intense that book touched me. I am actually trying to find it for my girlfriend too who is american. And i am please to see so many reviews from americans who loved that excellent book. I was afraid that the translation would somehow change something to Barjavel's magic. I am also convince that this masterpiece would do an excellent movie, and thought myself of writting the script version of it. And i'm glad that many people think the same way. Now there is no doubt this would be an hard task. But if it could be done as it has been done for the English Patient this would be perfect."
5,Timeless,"The story of mankind and it's best and worst, as told in a fantastic adventure that spans eons. This book will remain on my Read-It! list for a long time."
5,The best book I ever read!!! ASIN: 0688018602,"I read that book some years ago...I read it in Spanish (Nuit des Temps), so when I was looking for an English version, it was very difficult...Who can belive the name that it has in English? After reading some review I understood The Ice People, must be the book I loved. It was great to find people thinking the same about it.Now I will tell my best friend to buy so she can read in English. (Of course, I will ask her to let me read it again)THE BEST FICTION BOOK!!!"
5,For the seekers of Truth,"It took me a good year to get through the book. I would read maybe a chapter every night or so. Every section/chapter is loaded with meaning. It presents the reader with a spiritual path, a path of renewal. Anyone searching for truth should read it."
1,Boogie Down The Pounds by Richard Simmons,"This DVD's sound system is horrible, compared to the original (or earlier) Sweatin' To The Oldies Workouts by Richard Simmons. I can barely hear the music, plus it is not really ""boogie"" choreography. The quality of the DVD is questionable... it froze up on me and then often gave me a message (skipping over the damaged areas). Maybe it is because it is a ""Time Life"" DVD. It say's on the back.... ""New, pumped up versions of the '70s hits"".... But, IMO, it is a watered down and muffled version! Or maybe the quality of the DVD (damaged) causes the poor sound system. Don't waste your money like I did. I'd give it a NO Star rating but the system won't let me! Stick with the original Richard Simmons Sweatin' To The Oldies!"
4,Awesome and Fun,"Boogie Down the Pounds is my third Richard Simmons' dvd but ultimately, my favorite so far. Every routine was fun and at times, I forgot how much my arms were burning! It was very nice seeing some of the old crew and being surprised at how much weight they have lost. It was very motivating. I love the song selections and of course, the dancing.I'm just getting back in the game and every day is a struggle. Richard Simmons' is helping me to become active again and I love it. It feels weird saying this but I look forward to working out every morning.I would definitely recommend this to anyone. It really helps to work out seeing people who look like me and also where I would like to be one day. Thanks."
3,Quite a workout,I commend all who participated on this DVD. It is an extensive workout. I need to take it in smaller time periods.
2,Disappointed by the Richard Simmons tapes,"Sadly, this didn't do it for me. Found the video quality to be that of an old VCR tape that was several generations on from the original. Also, I found the steps were hard to follow with lots of quick, unnecessary changes. Just didn't flow for me."
2,Hard to follow,"I really hate it when a workout video goes right into the music and does not show you the steps. Hard to follow. Easy workout, but hard to follow."
4,Makes me want to work out!!!,Best workout for beginners!!!! If you are a couch potato this is the workout for you. Easy to follow. I want to workout everyday!
2,Boogie Down The Pounds,It was ok for a beginner like me I liked the music takes me back top when I was younger.
5,Humor a la Addams Family,"This book is well worth the out of print cost! A varied collection of dark humor and twisted poetry, one of my favorites is ""Little Thomas"" ...in which a young boy eats too much, and bursts... to the dismay of his housekeeper. If you like the Addams Family, you'll love this book!"
4,The Dawning of the 20th Century,"This is the very first of the Pulitzer Prize winners for literature. It is a portrait of life as it looked to those at the dawn of the new century. Roger is a widower with three adult daughters, each representing a different cultural norm of the time. First there is Edith, the eldest. She lives apart from Roger with her husband and five children. She represents the traditional values of family living of the time. Next, is Deborah a woman dedicated to the poor and unfortunates of the time, a social crusader pretty much in the mold of Jane Addams, more interested in making the world a better place than getting married to her doctor suitor. Last, is Laura his youngest daughter who is to become a woman of the world in the style that those looking back would recognize as the flapper girls of the 1920s. The characters are richly portrayed which is the strength of this novel."
4,Excellent Study of the Perils of Middle Age,"It could just be that the main character is about the same age as I am, but I loved this book, and swallowed it whole in a couple of days.Unlike other novels of the early 20th century, the writing in this book is stylistically modern and accessible. The central character is looking forward to a peaceful journey into his twilight years until his plans are confounded by the trials of everyday life and world events that change everything.It is a sad reminder that death, war, poverty, and all that those events bring are bound to confound our best laid plans.One reviewer commented that ""nothing happened."" I disagree. A lot happened. What I found most compelling is that that author was able to get into the mind of Roger and demonstrate how events that might seem ordinary to the world around us are often most extraordinary to those living through them."
4,Good for Beginners,"This book is certainly not for people rated expert.. or even intermediate users. Those two groups are already using email and browsing the internet. They are also able to find out most of the information written in this book by basic internet searching. I would however recommend this book for beginners.. whether absolute beginners or those who are still struggling to do anything worthwhile.The book is well laid out, simple to follow and does have some good tips. However there are also common sense items discussed like how to name the file you are saving and where to put it so as to find it again.Minor point, but part 1 discusses printing a document, however it is not until part 10 that it touches on how to connect and setup a printer :)"
1,coffee pot,"I do not like this because when I pour EVERY cup of coffee, it has a stream of coffee that runs down the side of the pot and all over my counter and myself. Which is not good when I have to change shirts everytime I poured a cup of coffee. It is the pouring spout, somehow it leaks everytime.My sugesstion is NOT to buy this certain 4 cup coffee pot. I paid 25 + dollars for it and now it's sitting under my cabinet."
3,Ok for the price,"It is a nice eye-catching red and the stainless steel carafe means no more breaking and replacing the glass ones. However, I find the 30-minute cut off very annoying. But for the price (I bought a refurbished for less than 20.00) it is OK."
1,Cuisinart: good / This coffemaker: bad,"I agree that the coffee spills all over the counter when poured. What could be more basic to product testing than that? Jeez, cuininart, what's up with this bad product? I bought it for the brand (and the price) but I almost (and this is a big almost) would have been better off with the Black-N-Decker. Materials in this coffemaker feel pretty flimsy. I don't like that you can't tell if there's any leftover coffee in the pot. I can't tell you how many times I thought the carafe was empty and I brewed a new pot into yesterday's leftovers because I forgot to check. Yes, my flakiness, but still not a great design. I bought this new at Kohl's."
1,Very Poor Research and Delivery,"I picked up this book at the local library because the title and brief description on the cover sounded interesting. I started reading the book and was amazed at how poorly written it was. Typos, bad logic, and a general tone of delivery that made it difficult to continue reading. Later, I skimmed the remainder of the book to make sure I wasn't jumping to conclusions. This book is very bad. I was curious to see what other readers thought of the book on Amazon -- I can only guess that some of these five star reviews are from the author's friends."
2,Be clear about what you expect from this book.,"I was looking for insights into how the mind works, or implications of modern science on the mind. The book started off, however, talking about the brain and its functioning. That was interesting to me. But after the first few chapters, it ends up turning into a textbook-like piece, simply classifying and grouping habits of the brain. If it isnt outdated yet, it will be outdated shortly."
5,Reality Check Is A Good Read,"Reality Check by David L. Weiner is by far one of the better books I have read on human psychology. After working in Rehabilitation and Corrections for a number of years, I know what a psychopath is. David L. Weiner tells it like it really is. This book is an excellent read for anyone interested in learning what makes people become what they are. I am confident that you will not be disappointed."
3,interesting but very broad,broad and eclecticnothing originalnothing deepgood for it's references to other books
2,What ever happened to the Character LISTS and MAPs?,I am a avid reader of this author. I have collected all of her books and continue to search for more. I was a little dissappointed with this one. The romance was not there as is in all her other books. Whatever happened to the sequels to Across A Starlit Sea??
2,"Not near as well written as Dust Devil and Love, Cherish Me!","She built up the character's life so much through the book, and then it was so quick to end, no additional chase or being held hostage. I liked the other books I've read because they were just so mis-matched and destined to be together, but then torn apart so tracigally, only to wind up toghether again. This was along those line of current-day era like Dust Devil, but I felt like I was weeding through a long 16 years to get to the finale. But I still like her and won't let this book disappoint me. I've gone searching for more."
1,Not One Of Her Best,"Rebecca Brandewyne was one of my favorite authors. Her first books were excellently written and researched. This is not the case with her latest works. Especially this book. Her characters are not developed and the way they talk to each other in this book is a hoot! No one on earth talks to each other like that. It's stilted and uncomfortable. I wish she would go back to the way she once wrote , until then I will not be reading any more of her books!"
1,Stupid and Farfetched,"This book has to be one of the worst I have ever read. The characters and the plot were unrealistic. Leah and Hawk were like cardboard cutouts, unexciting and bland. I was greatly disappointed at the end."
5,A Gift From the Gods,"This is something you should own if you merely like Gentle Giant. (Are there such people?) If, however, you see Gentle Giant as an essential component of the Cosmos, then, well, this is something you simply have to have. Your life will not be complete without it."
3,Quality car seat,"We bought this car seat for our 9 month old daughter when it was time to switch from the infant carrier. Rear-facing, the seat was very comfortable, but as other reviews say, quite large if you have a small car. When we switched it to forward facing, it is still very comfortable for her to play and sleep in for long trips. I also like that you can tighten and loosen the straps fairly easily. The one thing I don't like about the seat is that the buckle is a puzzle. I have to have a in-depth demonstration for my parents or in-laws each time they transport our daughter. Further, if our daughter is throwing a fit while we are trying to strap her in, it is quite difficult to get her buckled up. If I had it to do over again, I would probably buy a seat that is easier to buckle (though it is a comfortable, affordable seat)."
2,This seat drove me crazy!!!,"It's great in concept...a seat that should take you through to 80 lbs...but I can't stand using the seat. The reclining is non-existent, my eight-month-old can't sleep in it because he falls forward and gets ""jello neck"".The biggest trouble: The belt buckle is completely annoying...it is like a puzzle - this is even how the in-store Babies R Us employee explained it (as a puzzle) - you have to put the pieces of the buckle together just right and hold it together while you buckle it between the legs. It is too difficult to hold the top of the buckle together and try to push down to get it buckled at the same time...you would need three hands.I did like that it was relatively easy to install and the aesthetics are great, but it's just not practical. Thank goodness for Babies R Us' 90 day return policy - I'm on my way now to return it."
5,I HAVE TWO AND LOVE THEM!!,"I have 2 boys, my oldest was born in 2001, and my youngest in 2004--this seat is great, and VERY safe! It is also rated as outstanding in crash test ratings. I am VERY over the top when it comes to child safety, especially my own, and this is one thing I recommend to ALL people I know that are expecting. My 4 year old still does not weigh quite 40#, so he is still in the 5 point harness, and at a very tall 44"" (for his age) he fits in just fine! I LOVE THIS SEAT!! Very easy to adjust the straps, we live in Alaska and our boys are ALWAYS bundled up in the winter, we get temps of -65, and even in all of the snow gear, I can get them in and out of their seats with no problems/ hassle!"
2,Hard to Use,"We bought this seat on the recommendation of a friend. We liked that it is rear-facing and converts to a booster, but we hate the car seat. Our daughter is still rear-facing and it is difficult to put her in, the straps are always twisted (a safety hazard), and it is difficult to install and adjust. We are now looking at the Britax Marathon and the Evenflo Triumph."
4,What's the problem?,"I've read many of the reviews and don't know why so many people are having problems with the seat being backwards facing, or how the buckle works.My son is 4 months old and the seat is easy to get in and out of my Suzuki Grand Vitara and my Subaru Outback.Sure it's a tight fit in the Suzuki, but it fits. If it was forward facing I'd have no problem.Also, the leveling was easily adjust using a couple of Pool Noodles.Overall, I'm happy with it, and my son is happy since he now has room to move his arms and play with things, something he could not do in a tight infants seat."
2,Complicated and Frustrating,"I am a new mother and of course I want nothing but the best for my son. The salesperson at Babies R US recommended this seat and said it was the top seller, plus it had a weight capacity of 100lbs. My son has out grown his infant seat, so one evening I tried to install the Cosco seat. It took me 30 min to get the infant head rest out, another 10 min to separate the seat from the base, and another 10 min to adjust the straps. Not to mention I could not even get the seat belt to secure properly in my Jeep liberty ( the latch belt is too short)! Needless to say it is going back to the store! The car seat is very complicated and frustrating!"
3,Do the TWIST!,"I like everything about this car seat except the straps. They are constantly twisting, and it is nearly impossible to keep them from it. This is unsafe, and it takes a LONG time to untwist sometimes. They have a mind of their own. I have to say, it is otherwise a good seat, and my son has been comfortable in it since he grew too big for his infant seat at 8 months."
2,This is horrible!!,"This car seat is really a pain. First of all the lower buckle is so difficult to attach when baby is wiggling and screaming!! Second, my straps keep twisting!! We chose this car seat based on looks and price...but I would much rather pay more money for the Britax. We will be returning this carseat tomorrow!!!"
1,I Hate This Carseat!,"Not only was it a complete pain to install, the straps loosened up while I was driving and my 10 month old worked her way out of the shoulder harnesses. In addition, it is TOO DIFFICULT to get my daughter buckled up - it takes so long to get the complicated buckle to latch that the last time I used it (before I returned it) someone in the parking lot actually ended up helping me buckle it! So it wasn't just my imagination - even they said I should return it!DO NOT BUY THIS CARSEAT! I did only so we would be saving money in the long run and it ended up wasting time and energy instead."
3,not bad if it is installed correctly!,"I had just installed my alpha omega elite, It seemed difficult at first with all the straps and than I realized that my Ford Explorer dose not have anywhere to clip the straps to, so I used my car seat belt threw the back of the car seat, and it seems to be in very tight. I do plan on having it checked by someone. One of the things I am unhappy with is the Plush infant insert dose not come off of my car seat, it is stiched in, and when I put the pillow over it, it is way to bulkey to rest his head. I wonder if they are all like that? Plus the carseat dose not recline once it is installed. I guess I like the car seat otherwise. If it is in correctly. I do plan on having it checked out before I put my son in it.(I will hold on to the box and recipt just in case!)It dose seem like a lot of trouble for the money I paid for it."
1,Impossible to use correctly rear-facing,"The seat cannot be reclined back far enough to use correctly when rear-facing even by the manufacturer's standards. When in a fully reclined position sitting on level ground, it does not recline far enough according to the level guides on the seat. Almost all rear seats in cars cause it to lean forward even further. This causes the child to slump forward when sleeping. The only possible way to position the seat correctly is to prop items under the front of the seat. This seems very dangerous considering the props could fall out and the car seat would then be loose. Ours is going back tomorrow."
1,Busy Mom,"I am the mother of three young boys (the oldest is 3) and have 2 of the Alpha Omega carseats. The car seat is a nighmare, the straps twist and it is nearly impossible to get the children in tightly. I have to pull it apart at least once a month to untangle the straps. I have even tried ironing them but nothing works. I know at least 5 other moms with the same seat that have the exact problem. Save yourself headaches and buy another seat with thicker straps that don't twist so much.I hate these seats so much I am actually buying new ones for my youngest two because I can't imagine dealing with this for 3 more years."
3,WILL NOT FIT PROPERLY IN REAR FACING POSITION!!!,Everything I read about this car seat was great! EXCEPT that in my Jeep Grand Cherokee it will not properly fit in the rear facing position without moving the front seat forward as far as it will go...which makes sitting in the front seat in front of the car seat impossible. It fits great in the forward facing position but I won't need that for six more months. I'm searching for one that fits or else searching for a new car?
3,Maybe it will work better for older babies??,"I have had a hard time with this carseat. It doesn't recline enough to accomidate for the way seats decline, and everytime my daughter falls asleep she slumps forward. I don't know about you but I'm not about to have her asleep in the car like that for a long period of time. It is also way to big, we had to move the front seats up just so the seat would be able to fit between them. I am hoping once she gets bigger and maybe when i can face it forward it will work better. But until then it STINKS"
4,Nice but a little bulky,"We really like this car seat and the fact that it ""grows"" with our son. The only complaint I have is that it is a bit bulky---maybe that is because I have a small car? But even with that, we don't regret our purchase one bit."
3,Price to high...nice features...not worth hassles,"I bought this car seat for my 6 month old, who is almost too big for the infant carrier. Thought it had great features and because it went up to 100 lbs that it would save me money eventually but when I went to install it in my Chevy Tahoe the problems began. First, I have been installing car seats for 12 years and I thought I had this one belted in great until I went around a corner and the seat rocked over about 6 inches! In my truck, the carseat sits almost vertical, even when fully reclined as is required to be for his age/weight. His little head flopped forward when he went to sleep!! It's going back today and I'm getting something else. My advice, don't buy ANY carseat until you try it in your vehicle!"
1,Don't buy it,"This seat takes up too much space. But the biggest drawback is that the seat cover doesn't come out. So, if your child gets sick in the car, guess what.... You get to give the car seat a sponge bath. We found this out the hard way. The smell is virtually impossible to get out. We are now looking for a new seat with a washable cover."
1,Must READ.....VERY DISTRUBING,"Recently, I got into a car accident with my infant son while using this carseat. I do not recommend this at all for anyone. Not only was the carseat destroyed but it did not hold up in the accident. Later the fire department told me that the carseat did not pass highway standards for 2002. That is enough information to avoid this carseat at all costs."
4,car seat,I purchased this car seat for my newest grandson. It works very well and it is easy to adjust and lift off the base. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had one more position to recline so a newborn would lay more flat and therefore less likely to slide down or sideways.
2,Pass on this seat if you need a rear facing restraint,"This seat sounded like it was just what I was looking for because it could accomodate my infant son through his toddler years and beyond. Once I brought it home though, I felt differently. It is IMPOSSIBLE to install this as a rear-facing restraint!!! The manufacturer wants you to thread the seatbelt under the padding of the seat itself which seems physically impossibe for most people to do (unless your hands are the size of a toddler's and you don't mind a little bleeding). I've read other reviews that said it just took a little patience to install this seat, but I realize it takes much more than that. This seat seems to be made for the forward-facing position and as a booster seat so if you're interested in a rear-facing seat, pass on this one."
1,FRUSTRATION!!!,"I am a new mother of a 6 month old. I did exactly what every mother would do for the safety of their child and did my research. I found the reviews pretty good so I went ahead and purchased one. I have to say that everytime I put my son in there I get so frustrated!!! The ""puzzle"" buckle is not the problem, it's pulling the strap that makes it secure. Also, my husband had such a problem installing it and he is a very handy man! It wouldn't be tight enough or it would wiggle back and forth. Finally after about the 5th time and a few choice words, he finally got it secured. Well you know the cold weather we have been having? Well let's just say that everytime I put my son in there, I work up a sweat. Maybe it's our bad luck, but I would look around before purchasing this seat."
3,Works best foward facing,"I purchased this carseat for my daughter, needless to say she could not use it until she turned 1 (6 days ago) because it would not fit rear facing in the backseat of my 4 door topaz.Now that she is foward facing it is working fine for us, the buckle is a little difficult at first but, once you get the hang of it, it is a breeze. Other than the buckle we had no problems."
1,Doesnt Fit,"I was so excited when I bought this carseat. My 5 month old son had just outgrown his infant seat and this one came highly recommended to me. I tried putting my son in it in the store and he loved it. Unfortunately I had to return it. When I went to install it in our Subaru Forester it wouldn't fit in the rear facing position. In order for the ""level to the ground"" bars to be level to the ground the foot of the carseat had to be almost 1/2 way up the back of the seat of the car! Not only that but the front seats would have to pulled up so far that were unusable. I think that it would fit well in the forward facing position in just about any vehicle, but if you plan to use it rear facing you need a vehicle with a LOT of room between the front and back seats (minivan, LARGE suv, etc...)"
5,"#1 carseat out there, in my kids eyes!!!! Extremely safe !!","I currently own 2 of the alpha omega's and will be purchasing a 3rd here shortly! I have a 4yr old, and a 3yr old and 8 month old! I bought a different booster for my daughter sense i was going to give her's to the baby even though it goes to a booster, the new one had lights on it, and seat belted easy enough but my daughter wouldn't have it she wanted her carseat back,""take out the straps mom, i want my seat back!"" So back went her ""new"" big girl carseat and i'm on my way to get another for the baby!I love the fact i can adjust the height of the straps without ever removing the straps themselves, the puzzle buckle once you get use to it it wonderful! For a mom who has purchased over 12 carseats for her 3 children, i know and have researched and found this one to be the easiest to use, pleasant to the eyes if looks in a carseat matter to you, and a one time purchase considering it can be used until your child is 80 pounds!"
2,Head falls forward,We have used the Britax until trying this model and Britax is worth the $. We bought this model b/c of Consumer Reports and regret it. It has been sitting in the garage for instances we need to transport a friend. If my daughter falls asleep in it - her head is instantly falling forward and WILL NOT stay even somewhat up. No thanks.
2,Too big and difficult to install,"This car seat was too big to fit in my 4 door Honda Civic-which has a pretty big back seat (granted I didn't try moving the passenger seat forward, but I didn't want to crunch my husband.)We ended up keeping it because it did fit in my husbands car. It was also extremely difficult to install following the directions, we had to go to the store to figure it out. It will fit and work fine as a forward facing seat when my son turns 1 year. I ended up paying a little extra to get the Peg Perego Infant carrier/seat, but it was worth it, it installed in seconds and is so much easier to handle."
2,Buyers beware if you want to trust the LATCH system.,"We bought this car seat based not only on the reviews, but on the fact that it seats a child up to 100 lbs, was light weight, and looked good. We were told it was a new and improved model.The LATCH system on this seat does not work! The straps don't even go beyond the base of the car seat much less go down far enough to be attached to the car!We ended up using lap belts only to secure it, however are unhappy with how top heavy and loose it seems. We are having it checked over by the Highway Patrol (they will do this for free in many states) before we decide if it will keep it or not, however I see a return in my future. I should have stuck with the less expensive car seat I KNEW worked that goes up to 40 lbs."
3,Not for rear facing!,"We bought this seat when our son was 6 months, because although he is average weight, he exceeded the height limit on the infant seat. This seemed to be a good value... I liked the idea that it would be a booster seat for several years.Well, it takes up most of my backseat (I drive an AudiA4), does not recline, and as a result, his head drops forward every time he falls asleep! (Which happens pretty much every time he is in the car!!)Also we can not put the front seats back much at all!Boy do I miss the convenience of that infant seat!"
2,Disappointed Mom,"I picked this carseat based on all the reviews in magazines that I read. American Baby listed it as one of the best for children 5 lbs to 80 lbs. When I bought my newborn home from the hospital (weighing 6lbs) I found this carseat to be much too big. In addition, it was much too big for my SUV. The seat was too large to recline fully without pulling the front seat up as far as it could go, not to mention the 5 point harness is not the easiest to fasten."
2,ok... if you never need to clean it,"My biggest complaint about this carseat is how difficult it is to get all the pieces apart when it needs cleaning. My daughter throws up an average amount in the car, and taking this seat apart to clean it is a nightmare. Also, I agree with the other reviewers that I never felt like I was getting the straps tight enough, and they are constantly getting twisted. The ""puzzle-piece"" buckle is a pain, but I've seen the same thing on lots of other carseats, so I thought it must be a standard or something. I would recommend going with 3 separate seats - infant seat, toddler seat, then booster seat. This one seems like a good deal, getting more in one package, but the stress is not worth it."
3,Alright but not the greatest,"This car seat is ok but had I of not received this as a gift, I would have chosen a Britax instead. The puzzle piece buckle is a pain at first, but you get used to it. I only had the straps twist on me twice. This is a good carseat, but the complaints I have are personal, the saftey features are what is really important and this is a safe carseat.To the man who wrote in about his wife, my thoughts and prayers are with you."
1,too big for expedition,"I bought this as an extra car seat for grandmas ford expedition. And we couldn't believe it didn't fit! My daughter is 8 months old and I was tired of taking our seat (britax decathalon)from our ford explorer and putting it in her suv. We tried to install the seat in the rear facing position and to make it level with ground the driver seat would have to be pushed almost all the way up to the stearing wheel. Then when you turn the car off the seat automaticaly slides back. With the seat in the correct position the seat cannot go all the way back like it should. I am not a person hired to slam products, I am a mom tring to make life easier and the britax decathalon rated for up to 65 lbs. will last longer than any other rated at 40 lbs. and even though it is a larger seat it fits perfectly where the omega did not. britax is worth the extra money I wouldn't waste the time trying to use the omega in the rear facing position it takes up too much space!"
3,Once installed it seems ok,"I have not yet put my son in this seat. I just bought it today. It did take a while to get the latch belts in the way that are supposed to be. And come to find out they didn't even secure the seat in my Honda Pilot. The carseat moved all over. I had to push the passenger seat almost all the way up into the dash to get the seat to fit in the rear facing position. Also, if using a seatbelt to secure it is a pain to have to take off seat pads and put them back once seat is in place. Maybe now that all of the initial setup is done it will work out great for my little one."
1,Useless for rear-facing,"On the recommendation of the sales staff at Babies R Us, I bought this car seat - HUGE mistake. It cannot be levelled in my Camry. It sits bolt upright, no recline at all, even with the recline set fully back. Furthermore, the LATCH tethers are insecure - the seat wiggles all over the place - and it's very hard to install using the seat belts instead. I only found out that it won't work in my car after two solid hours of struggling with all the little bits and pieces and trying to make heads or tails of the worthless instruction manual. I would really think that a carseat manufacturer would make the seat functional for a car as popular as the Camry! Naturally I won't put my baby in this piece of junk - I only hope I can get my money back and buy a Graco!!"
4,Don't give up!,"I've read that alot of people have had problems getting this car seat installed. My husband installed it rear facing in my Suburban in the babiesrus parking lot in less than 5 minutes. My daughter is 8 months old and has been in this car seat for about a month since she could absolutely not fit in her evenflo infant seat. I feel very safe with her in it and she doesn't seem to mind it. She hated her last two car seats (she outgrew the Graco infant seat at 5 months). The between the legs latch is a little confusing but once you get the hang of it it is no big deal. If you have trouble getting it in your vehicle the customer service people at Babiesrus are very helpful and knowledgeable and I'm sure wouldn't mind helping. I think for the price this is a very nice, comfortable and practical car seat."
1,Terrible Car Seat,"This seat is a challenge to install, it is heavy, and the 3 piece buckle is difficult to use. We had a lot of difficulty with the belts twisting and like the other reviewers we could never get our daughter tight enough in the seat.The best car seats on the market are by Britax, we have 6 between our 2 young children (2 for Nana's car). After the Alpha Omega seat we decided to spend the extra money and get a good quality, easy to use/install seat. The belts never twist and the buckle is very eay to use."
4,PROTECT OUR LITTLE ONES,"Yes, it is larger than my last car seat, but this way I only have to buy one seat till he is out of car seats/boosters. I LOVE that!!!! Easy to install, change around, and I love the ease of adjusting the head rest. YES the latch can be a little challanging at times but when it is correct you know your little one is safely harnessed in. It is worth the piece of mind. He has fussed getting in and staying in other car seats and has yet to fuss in this one. I'm very satisfied and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone. I bought it for our long trip coming up & I want our gift from God to travel safely and comfortable. I know we made the correct choice!!!!!"
2,not a comfortable seat,"We purachased this seat after my daughter outgrew her infant carrier. I had it installed by the police, in which they had to remove the base and use three ""flotation tubes"" to get it positioned right. It is in the most reclined position (and the flotation tubes make it more reclined) and it is still very upright and at a very uncomforable angle. My daughter is 11 months and about 21lbs. and screams when she is in this seat and never falls asleep. She would fall asleep all the time in her infant seat. It appeared comforable at the store but do not be deceived, it is a very uncomfortable seat. I does appear to be a safe and secure seat and may be more comfortable in the forward-facing position, but I will probably be buying the expensive Britax because I dread driving in the car now. Would not recommend at all!!!"
3,Adequate but harness is a hassle,"We bought this seat based upon positive reviews when our daughter, now 2, was 6months old. The seat seems to be comfortable, fits reasonably well in our midsize sedan (forward facing), and looks nice. The problem has been with the harness mechanism. The straps are constantly becoming twisted and are a real pain to untangle. Also the 2-part buckle is a small frustration that when experienced multiple times per day adds up to another big hassle. The right and left sides of the buckle must be lined up ""just so"" in order to insert into the main buckle latch. The seat is fine, and once our little one is big enough to switch to seatbelts with if, I am sure we'll like it better. I plan to find a seat with a more user-friendly buckle for child #2, though. There are enough daily little battles without this one."
2,Pain in the rear seat,"We registered and received this car seat as a baby shower gift.We were initally very excited about it, but until we had to actually use it 4 months later, we quickly changed our mind. Once you figure out the puzzle of the interlocking harness, it is a breeze, however, untwisting in the plastic pieces is very frustrating. Also, we have a Santa Fe and the car seat does not fit well in the center of the back seat. It rocks side to side, it does not stay in a firm position, even after it is intstalled by a Fireman. I am constantly tightening it. With a second baby on the way, we need to purchase another car seat and it wont be this one again!!!!!Liam's Mom"
1,Didn't even install it,"I could not install this seat securely in TWO of our cars with flat, normal seats. I'm not a car seat novice........I tried every trick. After over an hour, I gave up. Seats aren't safe if they aren't installed correctly, and I have no faith I could install this seat correctly."
5,I love this carseat,We bought this shortly after my first child turned one and I love it. The fact that you only need to buy one carseat is a added bonus. I live in california and we have the carseat law 8 years 80 pounds and this carseat will take him all the way threw. We are now expecting our seconed child and am planning on buying the carseats for both my car and my husbands. I drive a Dodge grand caravan and it fits well on the smaller of the two bench seats as well as the captians chairs. My husband drives a 74 dodge challenger and the carseat fits well with the added teather strap attachment for a forward faceing postion( not needed in the caravan).
1,don't buy this carseat,after carefully doing hours of research on car seats i choose this one. i read other peoples reviews and thought that they weren't doing something right. the bottom buckle is like a puzzle peice and when your baby is crying and kicking it's near impossible to get to together. the straps twist too easy and although it's not hard to untwist it's just one extra thing i don't have time for. my son is 4 months old and looks smushed in it. the recline doesn't recline as much as you'd expect. the strap you pull to tighten the harness is near impossible to tug. refacing it hits the back of the seat and you can't pull up on it only out and the seat is in the way. but even with no seat it still doesn't tighten enough for my 4 months old. maybe it would be ok for a 1 yr. old and forward facing but it still needs a lot of time to figure out and adjust. im returning it and playing with every seat out there before i buy another one.
2,Horrible Car Seat,"After reading some reviews online I decide to try out this car seat. My son hates this seat, he screams everytime we set him in it. He usually loves car rides, now I dread having to go anywhere. The seat is huge and doesn't fit well in my back seat. I have a desent sized car. The buckles always get twisted and hit his legs funny, therefore almost pinching his legs. I am returning it today to purchase a britax. This is the only baby product I have been disappointed in yet."
2,Don't expect it to actually last!!!!!!,"I bought this seat because I wanted one that lasted from infant to booster. We bought it when my son was 3 months old. He's 20 months old now, and I called the manufacturer for a refund. First, the base of the carseat broke. I was annoyed, but I called Dorel and they said it is safe to use with or without the base, forward or rear facing. Then the plastic on top where you adjust the headrest broke, so the bars to adjust the headrest started falling out all the time. Then two weeks later I took the cover off to wash it and noticed the plastic buckle at the crotch was cracked all the way through!!! There is no way this seat would have lasted several years like I wanted it to. And I just used it like a normal car seat, it's not like I was throwing it around or something..... Other than falling apart, it was a nice and comfortable car seat while it lasted."
3,Help My Baby's Head Needs Support,"I have to agree with the other review about how this seat doesn't recline enough to compensate for the slope of the back seat. Even when I used a towel my baby's head hung down so low when he slept it killed me. This seat is bulky and awkward. Then the straps are uneven and when I tried to adjust even after reading the directions (and I am very, very mechanically inclined) I couldn't fix them. I'm frustrated. Hope this helps. Yes, this seat has kept my child safe but very uncomfortable."
1,childs worst nightmare,I have recently purchased this item and I was very unhappy about the product. I had to return it the next day due to the buckle not being able to unbuckle and the positon against my daughters thigh cut across her thigh and ended up snapping her thigh and leaving a bruise. There was no way to adjust this and make it work for her. It was to loose in the cheast allowing her arms to get out and to tight against her thighs. My daughter is 1 year and in the 65% for her wieght and hight so that wasn't the cause. I wouldn't recommened this product to anyone that cares about their child
1,Horribly confusing!,"My husband and I are fairly intellegent people. We both were confused as heck over all the straps. We are not rookies, this carseat is for our 4th child. Reading the instructions proved to not be as easy as that. We thought we got it, then realized we had it installed incorrectly. The first time I put our son in it, I almost pinched his thigh-good thing I was paying close attention and stopped before I clicked the buckle. We messed with that carseat for 2 days, thinking eventually a light bulb will go off, and we would figure out how to use all the straps. We got so frustrated, we took it right back and bought a Britax. We have only used it once today, and our son fell right to sleep in it. It is much softer, reclines more, and MUCH easier to install than the Cosco. My husband said, ""heck with this, Ill buy another carseat when he gets heavier than to have to deal with this stupid thing."" (edited version-as my husband was very frustrated)"
1,PAIN IN THE NECK,"I purchased the Alpha Omega Elite about one month ago for my 6 month old son. I chose it because it seemed to be the carseat that felt the most cushioned. Well, I just put it in my car today and had a ton of trouble with the belt buckle that goes between the legs. It is like a puzzle. By the time I figured it out my son was screaming up a storm......I am returning it tomorrow..."
1,The Alpha Omega is TERRIBLE!! Do NOT buy this!,"The Alpha Omega is quite possibly the worst product my wife and I have purchased for our baby, now 10 months old. The only thing worst than an overly complex (horribly complex) and crappy product is two of them...and we made exactly that mistake. My wife purchased one for her car and one for my car.The two primary reasons that product absolutely is the worst product we have purchased for our daughter are as follows:1) It is EXTREMELY to set up...this is a huge failing in the engineering and design. It is easy to make a difficult and cumbersome product; it is challenging to create a well designed and easy / intuitive product. It is VERY clear to me that the engineers that designed this monstrosity have never actually had to use it for their own families.2) You simply cannot remove the cover---in less than 1 hour."
1,"Bulky, Cumbersome, Difficult to Install",I really hate this car seat. It takes up way too much room. The only place we could fit it rear-facing and securely was behind the passenger seat. To do so we had to shove the passenger seat all the way forward so that means there is no room any longer for a front passenger. And even then the seat isn't reclined as much as the indicator says it should be (almost but not quite). I would have never purchased this seat. My mother bought it without consulting me and I used it because I'm broke. I have an incredibly small car and this is the worst seat for it. If I had an Escalade maybe there would be room. This thing is HUGE. Besides that it's difficult to get the baby in and out and adjust the straps. There is just nothing good about this thing.
2,Too Large For Most Vehicles,We have a Full Size F-350 Super Duty Ford Crew Cab. You can't get a bigger back seat but you still have to push the passenger seat up quite far. We have a TrailBlazer and purchased a different seat for that vehicle because the passenger can barely fit in the seat with this car seat in the back. The leveling is a terrible design also.
3,Difficult car seat,"I liked that this car seat converted to a booster but that's about all. It is very hard to install, the straps constantly get twisted and my son slumps over in the seat when he falls asleep. I am going to sell this car seat and get another one."
4,Great carseat for older baby!,"I wouldn't recommend this as a rear-facing seat, I simply think that infant seats are best for little babies. But I bought the Evenflo convertible seat first, and after 2 months, the recline broke and the seat was unsafe. So we went back to BRU and bought this seat. My daughter LOVES it! I love the recline option for when she's asleep. I disliked the Graco designs (only time!) because they don't recline. My daughter refuses to sleep sitting up. I love that she'll never need another seat, as this one converts to a booster as well. I do not mind the extra time it takes to buckle her in, so that isn't an issue for me. I think for the money, this is a great buy, and we're keeping ours! :)"
3,Mom's should design car seats!,"My son is 6 1/2 months old, and just grew out of his Graco Quatro Tour, which I loved so much. So we bought the Alpha Omega. My husband installed it, and it was pretty easy. We have a Subaru Outback, and the car seat doesn't seem to fit in the car properly, it doesn't recline to the right degree. So whenever he is sleeping in the car, his head falls forward. Also the material of the seat collects any sort of dust or fuzz, which is annoying. The car seat is nice, and it is also convienent that you never have to go out and buy another one."
1,Buying a new seat,"After several months of trying to come to terms with this seat, I am giving up and making a fresh start. The tether is hard to tighten, the seat is not stable in my brand new Camry, and the straps are CONSTANTLY twisted. Time to throw in the towel!"
4,Overall very happy,"This car seat does have a bad smell. I took all the covers off and washed it and it still smelled, but it has pretty much aired out over the last 3 months that I've had it. The covers are extremely hard to take off for washing. As far as the safety of it, I really feel like my daughter is safe in it. I have leather seats and I've had other car seats slide around, but this one stays put. She seems comfortable in it too. Overall I like the car seat, but washing is a HUGE pain! The safety and comfort for my daughter are what matters most to me, and I feel like this car seat provides those two things."
2,Straps twist up,"This is a nice carseat, but the straps twist up all the time. What a pain! Our $40.00 carseat from Target is so much better. Just an FYI shop around before putting this on your list."
2,This car seat has some problems,"My biggest complaint about this car seat is that the straps get twisted very easily and are very difficult to untwist. This is a problem almost everytime we use the seat. My other big complaint is that the seat is huge and impossible to use for a small infant who needs to be reclined. We have a mini-van and cannot recline it all the way.On the positive side, I like the front strap adjuster. This is much easier to use than the adjuster we had on our infant car seat. On the whole, though, I don't think I would buy this seat again."
5,Great carseat,"I had purchased 2 of these carseats for any children i may have to transport in my van (I am a nanny for twins and take my friends and their children places). On Sept 1st we were at a red light when all of a sudden we got hit from behind by a drunk driver. He had been going at least 40 kms/hr when he hit and caused damage to both vehicles. All the adults (who wore seatbelts) had back, neck and arm pains afterwards but the 4 yr old in the carseat was jumping around 10 mins afterwards. This carseat saved him from getting seriously hurt. I now have to replace that carseat and of course i am buying the alpha omega elite again. I truly recommmend it to anyone."
2,Not Comfy,"We brought this seat for our 5 month daughter,she was to tall for her infant seat. We were excited to use it, and tried it out in the house 1st, she seemed to like it. Installing it in the car was a nightmare (everytime it took me at least 10 - 20 mins). Then the true test I put my daughter in and she cried and cried(hated it). So I put her back in he infant seat, she stopped crying almost immediately. We tried a few times with this seat (she cried everytime) she looked uncomfortable and even in the recline position she looked to upright (and she loves to sit upright), so all I can say this seat was a pain, we returned it (we saved the box thankfully)and ended up with the Cascade Britax (when I put her in that she smiled at me, as if to say this is much better).So be cautious and let your child try it out (don't throw away the box in case you need to return it)."
4,HUNTER GIVES HIS APPROVAL!!!,"We bought this for our 6 month old son who outgrew his infant car seat due to being so long. We read through many reviews and consumer reports. We decided on this car seat. It was a reasonable price for us (not too expensive), yet it was still considered safe! Furthermore, he is rear facing still. I can see where it might be too big if you have a small car. We have a Chrysler Pacifica and it fits great! He can look out the window easier with this seat. He doesn't mind being in it at all. I love that there is so much space so he's not crammed in it. The only drawback is that when he falls asleep, there really isn't any place for him to put his head so his head hangs forward. I think we may need to insert some sort of pillow padding. Other than that, he weighs 17 pounds so we are hoping this will last him quite a while. So far, we have enjoyed this car seat!"
1,AWFUL carseat,"A carseat is only safe if your child is correctly fastened and secured in it. This carseat is a NIGHTMARE to get my daughter in and out of. The straps twist. The straps randomly fail to tighten, and the button used to release the straps is awkward and actually painful to use. I HATE this carseat. I am so frustrated that I've ordered the Britax Marathon. I should have purchased that in the first place. If there is ANY way to try this carseat out before buying, please do so."
1,"Bad Seat, Big Problems","I thought this seat would solve my delima with a tall baby. My child is long and lanky. Not Thick at all, and it rubbed his neck RAW! The pads moved out of the way and the straps are too close together. Also, his head flops fwd, like the other reviews have said.I had to return the seat, after 5mths use. The end of the line with it, was trying to put it in a friends van! It was sitting straight UP! I have it rear facing as he has Just turned 9mths old. We took a 2 hour road trip, and he was miserable, and that is when the straps hurt him. I would be afraid, VERY afraid if an accident had occured! DON'T Buy this seat!"
2,Too hard to install,"I bought this seat and spent an hour trying to install it in the rear facing position. I tried it with the latch and with the seat belt and either way the seat still moved around and would not stay reclined. I took it back the next day and bought the Britax Roundabout, installed it in about 5 minutes and it is very stable and comfortable for my 5 month old son."
3,multi-purpose or not?,"The thought of multi-purpose anything is wonderful, but this is not what I had in mind. I really don't recommend this to anyone who does not own a mini-van. I say this because the seat takes up alot of space and this goes for those tall people who needs the extra leg room. The chair isn't angled low enough like an infant chair, so my son it very uncomfortable. I also had a friends toddler seat in it for a ride and it was ok~ until he feel asleep. There wasn't enough padding for his head so his head would swing like an ostrich."
2,Returning this,"My 6 month old outgrew her infant seat, and we decided to get a convertible seat for each of our cars. I got this and the Britax Marathon at the store. Out of the two, I prefer the Marathon. The Cosco seat took forever to install on the LATCH, and will not recline at the 45 degree angle even with the base detached. Plus everytime my daughter has been in it, she screams until she is out or until she has thrown up. She doesn't do this in the Britax, which was a piece of cake to install. I'll be exchanging the Cosco seat for another Marathon. It's worth the money."
5,Keep this one in the running...,"I bought this car seat last week for my 3mth old who got too tall for his infant seat. I really love it. As a matter of fact, he would cry everytime we put him in the carseat/car prior to this purchase...not anymore! I, too, read the reviews, but went to my local toys r us and looked at all the carseats on display and this was the best for the money - nicely padded, I love the seatbelt because my two year old figured out how to undo his seatbelt - he can't do this one."
4,Great Car Seat!!! The Best One!,"We have now had 4 car seats for my grandson, (who is now 2 and a half) this one is very nice. It is very comfortable, he says ""I want to go in that car seat, I like it best). It is durable and so easy to adjust the straps. It is a like having a fine wine on a water budget. When we put it in the car, it really does not move an inch!!!!"
2,"Nice Looking, Bad in Use","I bought the seat and was impressed with all of the features it has, but. When I installed into my 4Runner, I had an almost impossible time getting the seat tight (don't have the latch system). After getting it installed, we put my daughter into the seat and tightened the straps. and the screaming started. the lower straps ride across the thighs of a baby and must be fairly tight for the upper body straps to be the proper tension. my daughter had a fit and wouldn't stop crying until we removed the seat and put her old back in. I went and bought the Evenflo Triumph 5 and she loved it, also easier to install.I would definately not recommend this to anyone who needs a rear facing seat. The seat should work just fine for children facing forward or who need a booster seat only."
5,great vocal mic,"The cobalt co9 simply sounds great! It has great weight and balance, excellent hand-feel and seems ruggedly built. If there is a drawback to this mic it is that it's more sensitive to feedback than other mics I've used, but careful eq at setup will eliminate that issue in most cases."
5,Funny,"After their trip to Mexico, the Chans go to New York to track down the Snake Talisman. The comparisons between Jackie and Viper as they break into the museum are funny, though Viper is actually after something else. They bump into one another and accidentally switch their items, so Jackie ends up with a rare gem while Viper ends up with the Talisman. However, Viper realizes that the talisman is much more valuable than the gem and decides to hold onto it...This episode had some great action sequences, especially when Jackie, Viper, and the Shadowkhan are fighting for the Talisman. Valmont also makes an appearance in here and a much welcome one/funny one. Overall a really fun episode."
4,Fun series,"When I first saw the trailers for this back in what was it, 1999 or 2000, I was rather skeptical. However, after watching a few episodes, I was pleased with it. The animation is smooth and the storytelling is solid. The first episode for this series does a nice set-up for the season, introducing the villians, the supporting characters, and giving you the idea of the plot without revealing too much (Shendu and Valmont's motives are not 100 percent clear in the pilot episode) This is a show worth watching, especially the first two seasons, so why not start off with 'The Dark Hand'? Truly a great cartoon!"
1,Disappointing,"Mind you, I rated one star not for the show itself, but for this DVD and the few others that were released. These DVDs are missing a few minutes, often the teasers before the theme song comes on. This particular DVD is region 2, so buyer beware. I don't understand the need for regions, and was only able to play it on my computer (and it was also missing a few minutes of the episodes due to bad editing). Why is Amazon.com selling DVDs that weren't even designed to play on US DVD players?I am also befuddled at the lack of a complete season or series set of this wonderful series. It would be so awesome if a series boxed set was released, with each and every minute of the show accounted for, and the Ask Jackie bits as well. I'm not sure why the quality of these DVDs are so poor, or why only a few were ever released."
5,woo!,"This is the conclusion to the series finale, and wow, what a finale it is! Shendu is finally freed from his stone form, and can now wreak his vengeance upon the world! Lots of things happen, but part of it is a great fight between Shendu and Jackie once the Chan obtains a spell that lets him grab talismans from Shendu's living flesh. If you liked the episodes so far, you're definitely in for a treat!"
5,good quality,Irwin tools have served me well in the trades for 40 years. I was sorry to see these are made in China but the quality is as high as ever. I especially like the quick release extensions. The 3.5 inch size bits fit my old faithful vintage porter cable screw gun perfectly and the 6 inch sizes reach recessed screws. The 1/4 and 3/8 adapters work well with my sockets and impact driver. I just wish I had bought the bigger Irwin set because I have missed several of the drivers supplied with that set and buying individual drivers is expensive. I like how the set stores each piece securely and easy to grab.
1,No butterflies came to this foolish thing!,"No matter where I placed it on my property, not one butterfly! They liked the juice from it that was left on a big rock when I moved it, but would not come to this plastic feeder."
1,Looks nice but...,"It was a nice addition to my deck, but it is very light weight even with water in it. Every time it got a little windy, the feeder flipped over and the nectar spelled over. I finally lost it during one of the storms :-( It will probably work better in areas where it doesn't storm or get window..."
3,BUTTERFLY FEEDER,"Nice looking devise, colorful but as a feeder fails due to leaks on the sides. The main unit consit of 3 parts, the handle, a top with some decors and feeders and the bottom with small nectar containers. However after filling, the unit started to leak for all sides, apparently poor assembly or no propper seals. I am using now as a decor on the garden."
1,Cheap and flimsy.,I don't think it would be possible for this to be any crappier. It leaks the nectar everywhere. It's cheap and flimsy. A real disappointment for my 6 year old.
3,"Great Idea, But Leaks","my daughter loves watching the butterflies on the back deck and her garden she is creating. this looks to be a great idea but she was disappointed when we put the water and sugar in as indicated and when she picked it up, it leaked all around the edges. so not feasible to sue when you need to pick it up and try to fill it every time and have to carry so carefully not to spill. calls for red food dye so makes a mess for tile floor when spilled. however, amazon has been great and is issuing a refund. other insect lore products have been ordered in the past, and worked very well."
2,Messy and easily broken feeder that attracts bees,"This cheap plastic butterfly feeder was a very short lived educational toy for my 6 year old daughter. It broke within the first few days even with gentle handling, it leaked and it attracted bees and we never once saw a butterfly come anywhere near it."
3,An Incomplete Novel,"I found myself interested in the book. I loved the technical info the author writes about. I wish the story hadn't splintered into the ""will the project be ended and all the people sent back to earth"" and the ""is there an alien coming back to our solar system"". The original concept for the book about a boy about to be a man and fighting to stay on the ship was interesting. I liked the characters also I wish the reader could have known them better though. I hated the ending, it was incomplete and didn't further the story or help it in any way. This could have been a really great book, it kept my attention two thirds of the way through. In the end it was just a disappointment. It is really a shame."
5,Infant Baby Car Seat,"I was completely happy with my Eddie Bauer Infant Car Seat. I needed one because my new granddaughter was visiting from out of state. The car seat looked nearly brand new. It was easy to use and both the baby and her mother were pleased with it. With the base in the car, we used the car seat both in the house and for travel safety. Both baby and her mother were pleased with it. We plan to use it for this baby, and for more grandchildren in the future."
3,Good for a little while,"I really like this product. Easy install, can buy extra bases, it is safe, and the positions are really nice. My son falls asleep as soon as we put in him. Some of the downfalls would be the handle is hard to grip and makes a big clicking sound. Unfortunally it is only rear facing and my son is three months and almost has out grown it."
2,"Great looks, poor performance","We recieved this car seat as a gift. We were initially very pleased because it is amazingly stylish for baby gear. The problems arrived when our little man did. He HATES it! The head/body support made him extremely uncomfortable- he would cry immediately upon being placed in it. We removed that. But he still cries as soon as the straps are fastened- something about them is very uncomfortable. We've tried loosening them, but there is not enough strap material to keep him safely fastened (it slips when there is too little). He's not that big a baby, but after only 3 months, we're going to have to buy a new seat! Also, the seat is enormous and difficult to carry compared with others. I don't recommend this seat at all!"
3,hate the handle,"The handle is hard to move, the grips are entirely too tight. It also makes a very loud click when it gets into place, I have a Graco as well and it is much smoother and easier to use."
1,Difficult to install,"I had a very difficult time trying to install the base in the car. No matter how tight I thought I had the seat belt, I could easily work it loose by rocking it from side to side. I spent 1 1/2 hours carefully reading the manual and then 2 hours trying to install it in 2 cars - a Nissan Pathfinder and a Ford Mustang. I called customer service at djusa and after waiting 30 minutes to talk to someone - they of course blamed me for how I installed it. I don't believe installing a car seat should be so difficult. No wonder 90% of them are installed incorrectly. This seat is too long to fit in a small back seat because it touches the back of the front seat - even when I push the seat so far forward that no one could sit there. The only way I could get a tight fit was to install the carrier without the base - and that eliminates all the convenience of a detachable base."
2,SAFE????,"I bought this car seat with the stroller as a combo. I mistakenly made the assumption that since it was more expensive and carried the Eddie Bauer name, it would be top of the line. When we came home from the hospital, it literally took us 45 mins to fix the carseat adjuster on the bottom of the base so that he wasn't sitting straight up. I don't like how the lower straps snap, I think it pinches my baby's legs. The harness straps are also constantly coming out and I don't see how this would be safe if I got into a car wreck! We don't have much money because my husband is a stay at home dad and full-time student but we wanted to make sure our baby was the safest he could possibly be. I'm so disappointed with our purchase and am now out of quite a bit of money. I thought I had investigated all of the options and thought I was getting the best and safest! I was wrong!"
3,are these reviews for the stroller or the carseat?!,"i will probably be receiving this carseat from a family member who loved it, and i thought reading the reviews might let me know how it was rated, i don't think anyones review was helpful everyone is obsessed with the stroller! anyways on the note that it slides around, all of my carseats do that no matter how hard i try to get them in right, i had the same problems with my graco snugride with my first son, the base didn't fit in my car and i just used the carrier with the seatbelt."
3,What?! No picture for Travelsys? No other place to gripe!,"I don't understand why Amazon or Babies R Us won't post a pic of the travel system AND the car seat. I registered in the store before the single stroller was available. I absolutely loved the car seat (so buttery soft!), but was told the travel system wasn't available yet. It's now available, but can't be purchased on-line, only in the store. Why not post a picture on-line and add ""only available in stores"" so that those of us who can't just trot down to the closest store on a whim, can actually SEE the item we're interested in. Also, my on-line registry (for those family & friends who are out of state) doesn't list this item until the very end with the other 'in-store only' items which, again, doesn't show pictures. End result rating? Product: (car seat - 5) Customer Service: 2 Needs work, guys."
5,Car Seat,"Very nice car seat ,not heavy as stated in reviews above(which must have been written by someone with string bean arms,typing review probally winded them).Seat is well built,straps are fine,handle is fine,easy to get in and out of truck with.None better!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"THis baby seat was basically a good seat. The only thing I did not care for was the sun shade. It would not stay UP on my seat. It kept falling down and hanging under the seat when I picked the seat up. So I just ended up taking it off of my seat and wearing hats on my little girl to shade her from the sun. Other then that, it was great. Lots of head support!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Try it before you buy it,"The LATCH system on this car seat is wonderful--it is so easy to put seat in and out of car. The problem with this Eddie Bauer seat is that it takes me 4-5 tries to move the handle --it is super stiff and the red buttons on both sides have to be ALL THE WAY IN or it doesn't click. My 6'foot, 220 lb. husband claims he can move it in one try, but I don't think it should be something you battle with on a daily basis. If you want to purchase this seat, take it out of the box in the store and see how easily you can move the handle!"
2,Unsatisfiedwithcarseat,"We bought this car seat to replace one that would not fit in the middle seat. Our son never cried in the other car seat. The only time he does not cry in this car seat is when we are moving. He is not comfortable in the seat when we are sitting still. The straps are not easily adjustable. You have to adjust them from the back whereas other seats have a strap in the front. The handle is straight across which makes it more difficult to carry. Also, the handle is very loud when it snaps into place almost always waking up our baby. I think there are better car seats out there for the same price."
4,not bad.,"We used this car seat for about a year.The color hides dirt and stains and overall was a good seat. However, the straps twist all the time and as if you don't have enough to do taking care of an infant you will also need to untangle them on an almost daily basis. We were never in an accident with this car seat and I believe that is the true test for a car seat.Consumer reports may be able to help with that info. This seat is heavy and my son was also heavy it was very hard for me to lug around. We purchased the Britax roundabout now that he has out grown the edie bauer and we LOVE IT! He is our second child and we have purchased five car seats the Britax is the best it is worth the outragous price."
4,So far so good.......,"We are really happy with this product and the tandem stroller to go with it.One point I want to make, make sure you're not using this infant seat past 22 pounds. I was a little confused by the review by the mother of a 2 1/2 year old, hope it was not in regard to this infant seat.Thanks everyone for your reviews, my husband and I use them often when shopping for baby and toddler."
4,Great Buy,"We are very pleased with this car seat. The head support works wonders and the material is very soft and cushiony making traveling for our newborn an enjoyable experience. Yes, the seat is a little on the heavy side, but that is something that I am willing to deal with considering all of the other benefits. As for the loud clicking noise that the handle makes when being lifted into place - babies should get used to noise. Over sensitizing a child can lead to you having to tiptoe around them and can make it very hard to get a child to sleep and let you have the rest needed. On the negative side - I do find the handle not quiet long enough, especially when the canopy is up. This does make it a little difficult to carry the seat for long distances. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend it for others."
4,Great Seat,"I am a first time mom. I looked at all the travel systems before buying this one. If you read the manual there would not be so many complaints about this seat. The straps have never come loose, they twist on occasion but what seat belt doesn't? It snaps easily into the base. The latch is tricky at first if you are not familiar with using a car seat. I would buy this seat again. If it were unsafe I would not put my baby in it for one second."
2,Wonderful toy!,"Bought this last spring and gave it to my then 3 year old twins for their birthday. All 4 of my kids (now 8, 5, 4 and 4) use this daily. They have a bit of trouble sharing however, so I have 2 more wrapped up for them to earn this summer. We have never had a problem with ours and I love being able to use headphones with it. As far as batteries go, we use rechargeable so the expense for the batteries initially has paid for itself many times over!"
3,Good Toy for Rich Families,"I got this toy for my son about a year ago, Yes I will admit this toy is not that durable, it does get lines across the screen often, but they always went away for us. My son loved the Videonow Jr. Player, But the way this thing eats batteries and how much the vidios cost, if your not rolling in money it's better to just get your child a handheld dvd player instead, at lease it comes with an adaptor."
2,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY! GO AHEAD BUY ONE..IF UR A SUCKER!!,"If I could give this toy a ZERO MINUS on durability, I would. I have a 2 year old daughter for whom I bought this toy. My daughter watched it all of 20 min before she sat it on the living room table and permanent lines began to come across the screen. We took the batteries out and put them back in...same thing. Are they kidding me when they say this toy is durable for preschoolers!!! Blow your breath on the damn thing and it will skip...(see other reviews). The sound quality sucks, and really the picture isn't the best either (but both are suitable for a toddler). Apparently these toys are defective seeing how the problem appears to be across the board. No wonder this thing is no longer being sold in stores. Buy one you'll see for yourself."
2,Toy not durable,"My mother (she's a great grandmother) bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. Unfortunately, at her age, she forgets to keep receipts. This item did not even work for two days. When I returned after Christmas, I tried to return it but could only exchange because the packaging had been thrown away.The second Video Jr. Now continually skips if you just bump it. I can never find any new discs at Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, or anywhere else. I put in a complaint to Hasbro/Playskool but I have never received any response back as to how to return it. I mean, it cost $40.00 and it's not worth it. I would not recommend anyone paying for something that doesn't last long."
2,CANT FIND MOVIES FOR PLAYER,MY SON RECENTLY GOT THE MOVIE PLAYER JR FOR CHRISTMAS. TODAY IS HIS BIRTHDAY AND FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS I HAVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR NEW MOVIES BECAUSE HE IS BORED WITH THE ONES THAT CAME WITH IT. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED TO HEAR THAT SO MANY OTHER PARENTS OUT THERE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. IF I HAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN I WOULDNT HAVE WASTED MY MONEY AND RENTED THE CLIFFORD MOVIES ELSEWHERE.
5,wonderful for kids,I bought this for my son for christmas. He loves it. It is durable. He has dropped it outside twice and it still works great. You cant use those cheap batteries in it thought. They wont last long. My batteries ran out fast cause i put in some cheap ones. The screen goes black and you can only hear sound when the batteries are going. I change to duracell ultra batteries and all is well. I am now looking for one for my other son and cant seem to find them anywhere. They are sold out. Movies are pretty reasonable. My kids like to watch the same movies over and over so thats good. Saves on having to buy a whole lot of different movies.
5,My son loves this!,"My nearly 2-year-old son received this as a present and loves it! Obviously, I don't let him spend all day watching, but it has come in handy when we are out shopping, or when he otherwise needs to be entertained while stuck in his stroller or in the car. He has a few of the DVDs, and watches the Elmo over and over... He's tossed it a few times, too....as toddlers will do...and it has held up fine. I'd recommend it for any parent looking for a way to keep a toddler happy when they have to be confined."
1,Mine broke.,"I just got this last week and the screen as already went out, I switched DVDS, batteries everything!!! It wont work! Just got sound comging out~"
3,A little disappointed,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son. He was interested in it for a couple of hours and then hasn't really used it since.I think it was too heavy for him to hold all the time and he also got tired but holding his head down to see the screen.I have to say it's pretty sturdy but I don't think its worth the $59.00, the Video Now for the older kids is cheaper, why?Also I find that it's real hard to open to change the disk esp if you have nails, lol. I think I'll just put it up for him until he gets older."
4,Great toy! But... make sure you buy the videos,"My daughter has the video now, so my son 3, wanted one too! My parents bought it for him for potty training, but they did not know that it didn't come with any video's. He opened it, we put batteries in it and he could not use it. It didn't even come with a preview disc. He was very disappointed.The toy is great, however it is quite expensive not to come with a disc for the kids to try."
4,love it but having some questions,I have 5 children and bought jr for my 5 year old (because he likes the colors on it) i bought the videonow color for my 6.5 yr old for christmas. are the dics interchangable. does any one find one better than the other?
3,save your $,my 2 year old got this for xmas she loves it but after 1 small fall it stopped working right it keep getting all static also the screen goes black alot so i took it back got a new one just opened it and already heard some too bad my kid likes it so much its really a piece of junk i would think for the price it would have actuly worked i guess im going to have to get the older kid one
1,Don't shop Toys R Us online!!!!!!!!!,I have been unable to purchase this from toys r us.... I have found that Walmart does allow me to buy it on-line. Why is it so difficult from Amazon(Toys R US?)
5,A sanity saver for a stay @ home dad,"I bought two of these for my two kids (ages 3 & 5)for Chistmas. They absolutely love them, they bring it everywhere that they have gone since getting them from Santa. The big ""Chunky and Colorful"" buttons are very easy for them to use. The battery life is not as long as I expected them to be but, I was prepared and bought a few large packs of batteries just in case.I was warned by a neighbor that already had one for their son that the screen easily scratched and recomended buying the case (which is very nice).I was also impressed by the selection Nick Jr and Noggin shows that can be purchased on disk. Also as a bonus you can use the Video Now Color Disks also so the kids can also watch their favorite ""Nick"" cartoons also.I hope that this review was helpful"
5,Highly recommend,This is my first meditation book and I couldn't have chosen a better one. Everyday I look forward to reading a new meditation. I use it with my ipod which helps me to block out the regular house noises. I have bought additional books to gift to my friends.
5,Relax!,I've been wanting to get into meditating because I can't seem to stop my mind from constantly racing. I am a huge fan of Sylvia's so when I came across Meditations on CD I had to get them. I have found Meditations to be incredibly relaxing so much so that I fall asleep everytime I listen to it! Which is helpful for me as when bed time comes around my mind continues to race with all sorts of pesky things making it very difficult to get to sleep. Like anything meditation takes practice and I will continue to do so. I think anyone who is a fan of Sylvia's will appreciate Meditations on disc.
5,I Fell In Love With This Book,"This is the rare crime novel that is truly funny, charming, and eccentric without being absurd.The plot is neatly turned, the characters well-drawn, and the dialogue extraordinarily deft--I don't know if this is how Mafia people talk, but it's certainly how they should talk.Unlike many humorous writers, Shames seems to treat his characters with true affection. I look forward to reading more by this writer."
1,What Happened to Bert the Shirt?,"After reading (and loving!!!) Florida Straits, Sunburn, Welcome to Paradise, and Tropical Depression, I was looking forward to more of Laurence Shames books. But he disappointed me, big time, he left Bert the Shirt, Sandra & Joey and the other wonderful characters and went on to write more violent, harsh stories minus all the warm characters he had created earlier. I don't know what happened to Laurence Shames - it's as if someone else took over the writing."
3,A disappointment,The reviews were good but I should have waited for the reviews from amazon.com readers. Their collective wisdom is usually quite accurate. The book never got off the ground. Good characters and plot.
1,Adjective-drenched Drivel,"Slogged through 12 or 15 pages of this adjective-drenched drivel. Got to the line where he describes a guy's crooked pinky finger as ""independent"" and i had to quit. This is truly awful."
1,dont waste you money,I ordered two of these one for each of my friend who were pregnant and niether worked we put it in to watch it with the babies and they both said error so dont waste your money on this!
3,Not exactly Like the title says,"I have to admit, has some interesting stuff and information on how to make the theory of Classes to Programs, but I can not agree that is novice to professional, in my opinion I would say just novice.Leaves many un-answered questions.But can work as a reference."
5,Great Book,I have bought about every book this author has written. And this started out with just one book. I would highly recommend this and her others books to friends.
2,A hard line,"Dr Laura Schlessinger recently gave an interview on revenge being sweet. The obvious question in your mind has to be 'is this woman really a bit hard on the imperfect human in a relationship?'. 10 Stupid Things Couples do to Mess Up Their Relationships, gives sound advice on how to analyse your partners behaviour and then leave or put up and shut-up. Thats about it. Short on solutions but big on critical assessment. Harsh."
2,Some helpful suggestions but also some thoughts dated 50 years back...,"I got the audio book and listened to it while driving to work. Although hearing some good points on unrealistic expectations I couln't believe my ears when I heard that ""day care is the modern version of child abandonment"" and that ""feminists have messed up so many things""... The author seem to be suggesting to half of her radio audience to give up the double-income model and move to a little town in the middle of nowhere far away from all temptations... It makes me wonder what kind of relationship the author experienced with her own parents and I'm pretty sure I know what Freud would say about this... Overall quite disppointing."
5,Great New Ground for Dr. Laura,"I must admit as much as I've enjoyed previous Dr. Laura books and benefitted from them, I could be thrown off by the occasional ""because God says so"" justifications--I've personally believed evolutionary psychology provides a much more thorough scientific / rational / ""intellectual"" explanation of behavior beyond what she's offered, as accurate as she can be in principle.However, I've found ""10 Stupid Things Couples Do..."" to be Dr. Laura's most down-to-earth, reasonable, thorough book yet. It's advice is true-to-the-bone, and my only critique is that its release was delayed by a few months, when I think it was severely needed even sooner.Bravo, Dr. Laura! If I ask anything, it is that scientific discoveries be incorporated even more into your works (things such as Robert Wright's ""The Moral Animal""). Books such as this are needed now more than ever, and I fully recommend it, be one's relationship believed to be in trouble or not (yet?)."
1,Ridiculous!,"According to Dr. Laura, having sex with multiple people, having sex for fun, practicing S&M, practicing oral or anal sex, living with your significant other without being married and being sexually experimental are all horrible, terrible things that ruin relationships. In some cases, yes, these can ruin relationships but this book makes anyone who has ever done any of the above out to be a bad person. Dr. Laura's books are a waste of paper and a waste of time."
3,Ten Stupid Things Couples Do to Mess Up Their Relationships,I really can't rate this book as of yet because I haven't had a chance to read it yet. I will as soon as I read it..
1,hated it,i hated all the preaching and negative slurs. she is too uptight and conserative. hated it.
3,average to disappointing,"I've enjoyed other books by Schlessinger, but this one seemed flat -- less focused and more repetitive than her other books."
4,Another home run for Dr. Laura!,"As a psychotherapist, I often struggle with thinking of books to ""prescribe"" to my patients. I have advised many of my patients read Laura's 10 Stupid Things books. This is one I've been waiting for ever since she started talking about it a year ago. Dr. Laura is famous for not mincing words or caretaking feelings when delivering her message. This book is no exception. At times, the constant ""letters from listeners"" can be a bit tiresome, but she manages to tie in her viewpoint with her signature wit, wisdom, and ""equal opportunity bashing."" Will this replace the work I do with couples and families? No, of course it won't. But, it does aid very well. Thanks, Laura, for another great book!"
3,Practical and secular relationship advice,"Dr. Laura is straightforward about getting your head straight about relationships, yet she's a bit crass about it. Shouldn't be too surprising, as her radio show is pretty much ""in your face."" Because of the style, I haven't finished the book yet."
4,Decent book,"This book is pretty good. It's one that I keep around and have reffered out to friends a few times. I don't think it's Schlessinger's best work, but the things she says make sense and give the reader a little insight. Do I think that it's ever saved one of my relationships? Probably not... but that depends more on the reader than the actual book."
4,RIGHT ON THE MARK!!!!!!,Success!!!! Dr Laura has done it again. Not only by using her wit but also her years of experience from her talk show to help couples avoid making mistakes! It is so amazing that if couples could read this together they may help to avoid falling into one of those 10 stupid areas!!! Bravo Dr. Laura! We are giving this as gifts to all our upcoming weddings!!!!
3,If you have major issues,Good advice for problem marriages. Not that helpful for good marriages wanting to make them even better.
5,Every couple should read or listen to Dr. Laura!,This is an awesome audio book! I really enjoyed listening to it and have loan it out to my neices and nephews that are in relationships or married!
1,Too Rush Linbaughish,Any book that recommends the bible as a follow through is not truly addressing the issues but merely echoing conservative religious beliefs for relationships. It started fairly independent but quickly turned into a sermon.It got really thick at the end.
1,More Dr. Laura Diatribe....,"Self proclamation does not a doctor make. Dr Laura's credential's are not within the field of psychotherapy-she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness, has been estranged from her own family for years. She who points the finger---has also had the finger pointed at her. Posing nude, living with a man without the benefit of marriage, having an affair, becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage, have all been written about Dr. Laura Schlessinger and made public. Noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite, unless of course, they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent."
4,Mud and THE MARCH: A NOVEL,"This is a great book which recounts Sherman's march through Georgia at the end of the Civil War. It definitely gives one the feeling of how the participants, both soldiers and civilians, suffered and survived. The characters are drawn so well that all the reader has to do is follow along. I recommend it. Of course, ELD is a unique and 'novel' craftsman."
1,Plot? What Plot?,"As a history and Civil War buff, I looked for to reading Doctorow's novel for more than a year. Disappointment doesn't adequately describe my reaction to this book. The characters are without personality, the battle scenes are dismissed in paragraphs, not pages or chapters, and Doctorow's stream-of-consciousness is his apparent excuse for a plot. In summary...save your money and your time."
5,Mission Accomplished?,"It felt wonderful to be in the hands of this graceful, stately storyteller again. I have never been much of a Civil War buff, but this novel has made me long for Ken Burns' cellphone number. As usual with Doctorow, The March presents real events as lived by a cavalcade of fictional and real characters. Pearl, the girl who finds love for the father who is also her owner, is one of Doctorow's most complex characters since Mother in Ragtime. The real miracle of this story, however, is its invocation of a less famous march than Sherman's: the liberated people that followed in the army's wake as it laid waste to the South. No longer enslaved but not quite free either, these marchers were a liability to Sherman, but also the reason for his campaign. This is a portrait of democracy on the run and a reminder that we are not the first generation to have inadequately planned for success in battle. The Stern Librarian (I take the wiki out of reference)."
4,Well-executed,"This is an important culmination of Doctorow's labors as both an experimentalist and recorder of American history. As a Southerner, I appreciated his use of landscape and the precision of description. I think it is his best book, creating American archetypes more than actual people as character and deeply impressing itself upon the reader. I do think, in parts, Doctorow becomes too sentimental and simplistic, showing his more obvious politics, but the language is so skillful and the general conceit of the novel so spectacular, he heftily makes up for these weaknesses. I recommend it."
2,This gruel,"I'm not a big Doctorow fan but the reviews were so good I thought I should read The March. It seems outrageous to say that it's a pleasant book about Sherman's march but that's pretty much what it comes to. Expecting a bracing, frightening and complex literary account of one of the most storied military events in American history, instead I read a mild-mannered young-adult novel which didn't for a minute ring true. Read Killer Angels."
2,Well written but...,"I just found it tiresome to read. Doctorow is an excellent writer but maybe a little self-important, feeling that he doesn't have to live by the rules of lesser minds. His conceit in casting aside quotation marks is really irritating; there's a reason they exist. I got tired of trying to figure out if the characters were saying something or thinking something. Ultimately I realized I no longer cared and gave up."
2,Disappointing ride,"I'm a great admirer of Doctorow and his idiosyncratic method, but THE MARCH is not in the same class as RAGTIME, HOMER AND LANGLEY, or even SWEET LAND STORIES. The characters run to caricatures or empty, illogical, non-believable ciphers, and the Robert Altman-like switching back and forth among multiple plot lines is far more distracting than entertaining. Sherman's march to the sea seems a worthy platform for his quasi-historical creativity on the surface, but Doctorow just doesn't make it work. And the African American dialect is atrociously represented!"
1,Doctorow's Weakest Book,"I have read all of Doctorow's books, and this was by far the most diappointing. It goes back and forth between the Union and Confederate armies, something I thought I would like, given the number of civilians who are suffering in our current ""leader""'s Iraq war. But north or south, white or black, there was no character to identify with and root for or against. Most reader's know what happened through history class, so there has to be something new to hold one's attention. There is little. I agree with the reviewer who said it was actually a children's book. Sherman is not much in it, nor is any other character. The cleverest device was Coalhouse Walker who appeared in ""Ragtime."" My own opinion is that this is the character who should have been focussed upon--a slave boy who 40 years later has success in New York City. I would not recommend this book. It was given to me as a gift, so I felt I had to whip myself through it. I actually felt myself skimming pages."
2,A disappointment,"While I'm not a Civil War buff, I would be willing to bet that there are better historical books written about this time and certainly, E.L. Doctorow has produced more memorable characters than are present here. People come and go, and none 'grab' you.The description of the horror and devastation are on so braod a level, that the reader cannot emotionaly identify.All in all, the book was a great disappointment to me, as I am a great fan of Doctorow."
3,3.5 stars,"Good book, amazingly written, but tough to read at parts. Definately worth all the awards it's being given."
1,Poor History,I tried to read it just as a book. But when the author uses actual historical people it becomes more than that...it becomes a historical novel. In this instance the author has portrayed historical people not as they were...but rather perhaps as he sees them. As an amateur historian I see far too many distortions...which rather ruined the book for me. I guess I could not separate fiction from reality.
2,It Plods,"Very disappointing. Numerous characters, none of which are developed, or interesting (to me), or ring true. They come and go in a seemingly random fashion, interact, and then go away. No sense that Doctorow has any feel for their internal lives, that they have any internal lives.If you are interested in the Civil War (as I am) almost any literate history is much better than this. Grant's autobiography, which is essentially a series of campaign dispatches, has ten times the life, human, historic,and literary, as this.If, as another reviewer implies, Doctorow was trying to emulate War and Peace he will have to deal with a very angry Tolstoy inthe next life. It just doesn't work."
2,If you can read his thoughts...,"I found this book to be tedious, and very hard to follow. The lack of quotation marks is very annoying, and makes the separation of dialog from description difficult (at least, for me). Also, as others have said, not at all historically accurate; Doctorow takes liberties that wouldn't be tolerated in others. But, because he's an ""accomplished author"", it's acceptable. All in all, a very tedious story, and a hard narrative to comprehend."
2,"Readable, yet flawed.","The March is an okay read. I am glad I did not purchase the book myself though. Despite the rich historical background, Doctorow fails to pen a cohesive novel. Many of the characters, as well as the plot are poorly developed. Certain characters such as house slave Wilma are dropped from the plot in the middle of the book. The reader never has a chance to know what becomes of her as the March progresses. The ending too is trite and unrealistic for the time. It is as though Doctorow threw the ending together hurriedly in order to get the book to the printer. For a great Doctorow read, pick up ""Ragtime."""
2,Disappointing,"There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself. It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling."
5,Very readable.,"""The March"" is a very readable account of Sherman's march through the South at the end of the civil war. The focus is on what it meant for the soldiers and civilians, not the politics or the strategy. At the same time, the characters are well drawn as individuals. Doctorow maintains an emotional distance from the horrors; while the reader is made aware of them, none of the characters followed as individuals in the novel starve, or suffer unbearable pain (one Southern woman is driven to the edge of madness, and several die). There are some powerful passages, but for the most part the writing does not draw attention to itself. It captures the March in a book of modest size, has interesting sub-plots, and I would highly recommend it. For a very different, but very good and more powerful take on a March, read Patrick Rambauds ""The Retreat"", on Napolean's retreat from Moscow."
2,more stroll than march,"Doctorow may be the darling of the reviewers, but The March left me flat. This is a fair book that could have been as epic as Sherman's march. Instead, it reads more like an outline or rough draft, almost as though the author had a few weeks to kill, and this was the result. As stated by another reviewer, the ""silent dialogue"" style was annoying, and rendered the characters one dimensional and not quite real. These were good characters who were cheated out of coming fully to life. Thus, the entire novel had a sleepy, documentary quality about it. For absorbing and credible historical yarns, I will stick with Michener, Jakes, and others."
3,"A gripping Story, but, the details?","I found the book fascinating both for its ability to make one feel a part of the conflict and the level of detail about the March itself. Still, some of the characters seemed stereo-typed, such as Emily Thompson and the slaves we encounter along the March. I have always given Doctorow credit for getting the details right but when he had Sherman humming ""Ride of the Valkeries"" on p. 121, a work that would not be heard for five more years in Germany, it made me start to wonder about the rest of the work. What else did he miss? Now I have to do some more research."
2,Sherman's march the skims the surface,I never really got the feeling of outright horror while reading this book. Sherman's march across the South was a gemini state of brillance for the North and a near holocaust for the South. This book never really portrays that feeling. This is more of a 'made for tv' type of book. This needed to be harsher and more cruel.
3,Phoned In,"Although he closes strong, expecially in his depiction of Lincoln, this novel gave me the feeling that Doctorow phoned it in rather than really applied himself to the task. It is a relatively short book that is double-spaced to increase its apparent length. It isn't bad but it is noticeably thin on characterizations and details."
2,THE MARCH to Nowhere,"I am a fan of Doctorow. I consider Ragtime, with its brilliant mix of fact and fiction, a clear window into the soul of late 19th century America. As an avid reader of military history, I was eager to find the soul of the civil war in Doctorow's newest creation, The March. My disappointment is on every level. The characters are shallow and often killed without any apparent narrative purpose. The war is presented as a cartoon backdrop without any insight into the stress of battle. I was neither happy nor sad at the end of the book, just disappointed that The March led to nowhere."
3,Fairly interesting,"While I found myself plodding thru some of the chapters and trying to remember who was who, I did manage to finish the book. Not a great character developer, but I did find the book to be somewhat interesting from an historical viewpoint. Like other reviewers, I was asking why the absence of quotation marks - at first I thought it was a typo of sorts.If nothing else, this book has made me want to read more Civil War historical fiction."
3,"Interesting in parts, hard to follow as a whole story.","I found this book interesting in parts, but hard to follow as a whole story. The author does a good job of describing the scenes beyond the actual battles. I had a hard time keeping up with the many characters; would have preferred fewer with more story development for the remaining."
3,The March,The March by E. L. Doctorow wasn't as new looking as I expected. I was hoping for beeter as this was gift
4,a good Doctorow read,"Doctorow has created big, complex and interesting characters, with his customary wit and depth, in a roaring historical moment that captures the awful and the mundane in war."
4,"Sherman's March, fictionalized","I read this gripping novel immediately after finishing Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals,"" her biography of Abraham Lincoln. It was fascinating addendum to the Lincoln story, and it was fun tying some of the events outlined in the Lincoln story to Sherman's march through Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.I've only dabbled in Doctorow's fiction since ""Ragtime,"" but this will likely send me back to other works of his. The story of The March, of course, is historical, but the characters he creates are wonderful and full-bodied...complex, not one-dimensionally ""good"" or ""bad.""The final scene in the book, presenting a representative (or symbolic?), personified sample of all the cultures that struggled together and with each other in the period, offers a hopeful conclusion to what could have been the dark, sometimes hopeless reality of 19th Century American history."
1,Overrated,"Ragtime and Billy Bathgate were great novels. This one isn't. I was so looking forward to reading this as I am a student of Civil War history. Instead, The March is a confusing mish-mash of about two dozen characters that a reader can hardly remember as he/she gets deeper into the book. Compounding that - it's a hard book to read. Doctorow chooses not to use quotations when people are speaking, which forces me to re-read passages constantly so that I am in sync with the characters. General Sherman and a few others are constants throughout the book, and admittedly Doctorow has a flair for describing certain incidents. In the end, there are so many characters and so many banal passages where nothing ever happens, that finally 3/4 of the way through the book, I finally skipped to the last 10 pages just so that I could be done with it. I checked this book out of the library. I suggest you save your money and do the same."
2,soap opera,"The novel is made up of several intertwined narratives, following the lives of many characters. The events take place during Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas. The book starts out with some promise, but the characters never come alive. Neither are there any compelling historical perspectives. In the main quite predictable, the book is a good alternative to passively watching television."
4,Believable fiction,"Brilliantly written account of Sherman's march played out by ficticious characters. The author made me feel as though I was there. Curiously, there are no quotation marks around dialogue so you have to adjust. But, it's worth it"
1,not very good,"this novel is not very good...weak on characterization, poor writing, hard to follow at times. find yourself another book on the civil war."
1,"E.L., Say It Isn't So.","When I saw this book was rated 5-stars, my head exploded. If you're curious about the civil war, read Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"" or Kantor's ""Andersonville""; if you're curious about Doctorow, read ""The Book of Daniel"" or ""Ragtime""; if you want fluff, read a novel by a woman with three names or ""The March"". What a disappointment."
1,A thin boring book,"If you are E.L. Doctorow, you get published in New York Cityand you will get lauded as he has been for this book. That doesnot make it a fine and compelling read. The plot and characters and scenes are known and as predictable as the ending. The hoopla for this book comes from the New York literary world's appreciation for his past writings. Just like Hemingway's Nobel for ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Awards for past services rendered. Why not a watch !!!"
2,Disappointing,"I believe E.L. Doctorow is one of the finest American authors. However ""The March"" isn't half as good as his ""Sweet Land Stories"" or ""Cold Mountain"" by Charles Fraizer."
1,"Dull, tedious need I say more","I know I should not have bought this book. My past experience with E.L. Doctorow's literary works have been less than enjoyable. His writing is consistent; dull and tedious. Since my college days, about 50 years ago, I have always finished every book that I started to read. There must be something worthwhile in every context. There may have been in this book, but it certainly wasn't in the joy of reading. I was taxed to finish reading this book"
2,A disappointment,"Another reviewer started out his review with the question: Did we read the same book? Those are my exact sentiments to the reviewers who praised this work.Doctorow has always been a difficult read to me. Although I loved the musical RAGTIME, I found the book difficult to read. At that point I gave up on his books. Had I taken that pattern into consideration, I would not have bothered with THE MARCH.As usual Doctorow has a ""shotgun"" - scattered approach to his characters. You get a little bit of various characters who eventually interact. As a result, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters, except perhaps Pearl, the mulatto former slave.I'm sure that THE MARCH will become a movie. Sean Penn will be great as Arly and Hallie Berry will play Pearl. The screen writer will tighten up the story as did the writer for Ragtime, the musical.General Sherman makes limited appearances in the story.The only strong point of the novel is the demonstration of the brutality of war."
1,Did we read the same novel?,"This novel is a great disappointment. It is mostly pretense and stereotype. This is no Ragtime. Doctorow's characters are flat and tasteless as are many of the pedestrian musings they are prone to. The March is not a tapestry of rich and vibrant characterizations nor is plot driven. There are no surprises, no great revelations, not even much of a story. It is more cotton candy than even mind candy. It is at best a callow Gone With the Wind. Doctorow has not written a story; rather he has just filled pages. Find something better. What novel did the other reviewers read?"
1,Unreadable,This book is simply unreadable. I agree with the other lower stars so there is no need to reiterate what they have said. A waste of time.
5,Sherman and the South,"This book recounts Sherman's ""March to the Sea"" in 1864, and then his turn North to the Carolinas to possibly link up with Grant. It's told from various viewpoints, there being a plethora of characters to follow during the course of the book. It's as historically accurate as possible, and is so well written that you believe in the fictional, as well as the actual historical characters. It's sad and funny and runs through a gamut of other emotions as the tale unfolds. It's not real history, but I would recommend it to someone seeking to know more about the lives of folks during that period of the Civil War."
4,Great Salsa music,"The princess of Salsa music ""India"" & the current King of NY Salsa music ""Marc Anthony"" together singing some of their best individual Salsa songs & together for others like Vivir lo Nuestro. It's a great video of Salsa music."
5,Jus as good as I remember,"I remember watching Shirley Temple's movies on TV as a child. Watching them again on this DVD, they were just as good. A great feature of this DVD is the ability to watch all the films in Black and White or Color. Overall this is a great collection for a Shirley Temple fan. I just ordered the 2nd volume of the collection. Can't wait to own them all."
4,My Mom loved it,"Hey, what can I say? I bought it as a gift for mum and she said it was fine. She had other old Shirley Temple movies recorded off the TV onto VHS, so the improved video quality and faster DVD access (no rewinding) was a plus."
4,Black and white and colorized.,"I like the black and white versions better but it's nice to have a choice. I was a bit worried when I saw the quality of Curly Top but it may have more to do with the film's age and preservation than this boxed set. Heidi was in excellent condition. My three year old niece fell in love with this from the opening credits. ""I want to watch Curly Temple again."" From the mouths of babes."
4,Shirley Temple,"Very nice set. Understandably old cinema technology, but good entertainment for young children, and always impressive talent of an extraordinary child actor to both young and old - an integral part of movie history."
2,Glitches,"The first time I played this movie (Heidi), it ran fine, but the second time, it got stuck and ""skipped"". It was not very good quality. I have not watched Curly Top or Little Miss Broadway yet."
2,Many Scenes Cut From Films,I bought these for my Grandaughter and we enjoyed them but I have watched Heidi many times over the years and scenes were clearly cut. The scene where she wanders downstairs in her night gown and is mistaken for a ghost was cut. Also the scenes where Clara learns to walk in the mountains including the part where Peter the goat boy pushes Clara's wheelchair down the mountain was cut. The scene where she climbs the church tower in Franfurt trying to see the mountains where her grandfather lives was also cut. Very disappointing. No good reason to cut the scenes.
3,Heidi/ Curly Top/ Little Miss Broadway,"Its great to have these titles on DVD now. All great classic films. The quality of the source material really isn't bad, but Fox never seems to go the extra mile with older classic film titles, giving us the extras that most people really love to have. The trailers are of very poor quality and as far as the colorized version is concerned, its of very average quality, when you compare it to other more recent black and white titles that have been converted to color (like the first season of bewitched, it really looks fantistic). But you can always enjoy the classic black and white version if your not happy with the color. But no matter its great to see Fox release these classics on DVD for young and old alike to enjoy."
5,Very Sweet,":) happy to share my childhood memories with granddaughter. I had forgotten that it seems in every movie, practically, she is an orphan or has only one parent!!!"
5,Classic for a New Generation of Children,This was purchased as a gift for a family with 3 girls ranging from 3 - 16 years old. All of them loved it! It is sweet and innocent.
2,Troubling for small children,"I thought our little 3 year old ""princess"" would love the music, dancing and singing. But she focused in on the cruel way children were treated in these stories. Even our 6 and 8 year old grandsons were troubled by the harshness of some of the adults. The difficulties faced by children in these old movies may not be suitable for young children, causing worries and distress beyond their years. We threw away our set."
1,slow shipping,I just want to know why this is taking so long to ship. I ordered it on 1/1/11 and today is 1/15/11 and it still has not shipped?????
5,Mom of Sav,We have all Shirley's movies! They are just charming for any little girl. I love them too!!!
4,Is that fiction?,"I hope Prof. Wells never reads her pupil's review. It's nice, but comes off as a sorry piece of brown-nosing. Why? Not because of the clumsy praise--that can be forgiven. Answer: SPELLING ERRORS! Two in a row (""The assiocations here characters make""). A writing professor's nightmare, I'm sure. I never thought I'd sign on here just to critique another writer, but there was no other choice.Oh, yes. Kellie's book, as the Library Journal says, is ""suitable for all public libraries."" The highest praise!"
2,Nonsense doesn't equal depth....,"I like to think of myself as a fairly intelligent reader, and I'm pretty good at understanding most fiction that is experimental and explores the existential, but I'm sorry, Wells doesn't cut it. She does have a clever use for language and vivid imagery, so I can see why she won the Flannery O'Connor award, but other than that I can't agree with the praise of previous posters. Many of her stories seem a bit hokie and too cutsie for my taste. The vagueness of her prose when trying to illuminate the thoughts and feelings of her characters substitute depth with nonsense that drags on and on and on.I hope to see bigger and better things from Ms. Wells, and I wish her the best.Buy some books by Aldous Huxley if you want experimentation and existential depth. Don't waste your time with this book."
4,The Intuition Toolbox,This book is a good resource for learning about your intuition; however actually learning & using some techniques are diffcult; it would be great if there was a way to contact the author or his web site if one gets stuck on the way to devloping their intuition.
5,The cd is very inspirational and seeing live is even better!,"The cd does them no justice. To hear the songs live is even better than the cd recording. But I recommend if you love gospel music, then you'll like this cd, I guarantee it!!!"
5,KURT CARR DID AN AWESOME JOB,KURT CARR AND THE KURT CARR SINGERS DID AN AWESOME JOB ON THIS PROJECT. ALL OF THE SONGS AND EVERYONE THAT HAD A LEAD DID AN EXCELLENT JOB. THEY LET THE LORD USE THEM IN A MIGHTY WAY AND IT REALLY SHOWS. THIS IS THE FIRST CD THAT I HAVE BOUGHT OF HIM AND BOY WAS I IMPRESS. THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE. THE BEST SONG ON THE WHOLE CD IS FOR EVERY MOUNTAIN. THIS SONG IS AWESOME. YVETTE WILLAIMS IS AN ANOINTED SINGER. THIS SONG REALLY SHOW THAT SINGS FOR THE LORD. HER VOICE IS SOO AMAZING.SO IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD YOU NEED TO GET IT. YOU WILL BE BLESS.
3,No One Else,I purchased this CD after hearing certain songs from it. I am very pleased with the music presented on this CD. It was received in good condition and in a timely manner.
4,A Lucky Find,"This book came from a 1985 exhibition at the Guggenheim. I attended the opening night of the show back then, but I failed to buy the catalog. Luckily, copies of this important book -- by the best curatorial sources -- are still available in good condition"
3,Good Book - Bad Audiobook!,"First, let me say that Daniel Ellsberg should have read the entire book by himself. It was moving, personal, authentic and very convincing. The reader hired to read this audiobook sounds unprofessional. His attempt on voices of generals and presidents are really bad and not at all well done.Overall, I learned a lot from this book. A lot! Too bad that that the US government did not learn anything from previous history."
4,"Excellent book. real issue, questionable perspective","Read the five star reviews: Everthing they say about the quality of the writing, the suspence, the detail and the ultimate importance of the Pentagon Papers is true. As a veteran of both the war and, later, the anti-war movement, I could not be more pleased that the Pentagon Papers came to light and the futility of the Vietnam War was finally made clear. ...The truth is the tragic story of the Vietnam War and the muddled decision making that got us there and kept us there. The fiction is that Daniel Ellsberg is a hero."
2,Interesting And Timely...,"...given our current circumstances in the Middle East. And it serves as a reminder that we must be willing to be ever-vigilant of our government's actions, asking the difficult questions, demanding the tough answers, and never accepting anything at face value. But, at the end of the day, to accept the author's premise that ""we were the wrong side,"" one must be willing to accept the notion that the totalitarian regime of Ho Chi Minh would have somehow been good for the world, and that we should just be willing to look the other way when evil asserts itself outside of our borders. For some of us, *that is far worse than the wages of war and all it brings with it. ~xtina"
4,Insights into government entry into a war,This is a very readable book. It brings back many memories of the Vietnam era in the United States. It also gives insight into how many members of the government can make a war happen.
1,Synthetic bedding,this stuff is no good.the poly fibers can actually cut off the limbs of babby gerbils and hamsters. Go for the natural fiber stuff made of cotton.
1,THIS CAN KILL ROBO HAMMYS :O,"i would give this -5 stars because my hammy sufferd a stroke from getting tangeld DO NOT BUY she is still recovering , but it almost KILLED HER DO NOT BUY IM NOT LIEING i forgot to take a small bit of fluff and it got tied on her foot and it turned Purple and we finaly got it off and know her foot is puffy and red , thanks alot super pet fluff >:-(NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER BUY FLUFF IT CAN KILL"
5,a good reason to buy in amazon,"i live in Peru and the bookstore charged me around 35 dollars for each dictionary, considering I have 2 kids and this book was obligatory, and a very necesary tool. I am so very thankful that amazon exists, as I paid 17 dollars for both, they were pre owned but looked like never been used."
5,Great Book!,"This is a great book for anyone, but especially for anyone about to enter adulthood, the workforce or graduating college. It debunks all the myths on how to create wealth, and teaches you how to re-program your belief system on how wealth is actually created. Highly recommended!- Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
4,One of several books I have read by the author,"I have read Robert Allen for years, and continue to enjoy his books. Some of the info in them is getting a little older, but you can still glean a lot of useful information from them. One of the first things I like about this book was that it shows us how misguided we are about how we think about money, and that is what holds us back.Paul Buckner,author of: ""From Broke To Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedom""and""Gabriel Jennings and The Ferret Freedom Fighters."""
5,You can't beat the classics!,"The excellent book by Robert G. Allen was originally released back in 1986, but the advice is timeless.Although many have attempted to copy Mr. Allen, most are mere imitations. His material remains fresh, strategies are workable and his writing style is entertaining and informative.This book had been revised and updated. I also recommend Multiple Streams of Income, Nothing Down for the 90's (still works in the new millenium) and The One Minute Millionaire.Creating Wealth is a classic and a must read for anyone who wants to create real wealth."
3,There is always something to learn,"Although i find the book to be pretty outdated and based in seller financing, there are some other topics as taxes that were interesting for someone like me that does not know much about property taxes. There are other books out there that are a more worthwhile read than this one."
3,Not 100% Relevant to buying UK Property,A comprehensive book that has a low risk ten year strategy for making a million from purchasing residential property. The chapters on leverage and tax avoidance are not really that relevant to people like myself looking to invest in the UK property market.The strategy is not just about the technicalities of buying but a new way of thinking about wealth.Worth a read.
1,Nothing new,Everything the author says appears to be correct. However I found nothing new or that would give a competetive edge in creating wealth. Two word summary: common sense.
1,2002 not 1986,"The book would be a great find if the year was 1986 (the year this book was written). As I write this review the year and date is DEC, 29 2001 - as you can tell some time has past since 1986. The year the information in the book is relevant to. Time has changed and so has the economy. To bad the author of the book has not changed with the times and updated the information. I do not recommend this book."
2,No Secrets Found,"No secrets revealed. The message is 'invest in real estate'. My response; ""No kidding. That's not a secret"". Unless you want to play in the Real Estate market, this reading is a waste of time and money."
1,Extremely out dated,"Although the cover of the book reads ""Completely revised and updated"" this book is painfully out of date. Allen's references are all in the 1980's. $39K for a single family home, interest rates at 18%. I don't care what city you live in or near these references simply don't make sense in todays climate. I had to stop reading it."
4,Creating Ideas,"Though this was a good book, and I do recommend it, it has a few flaws one should be aware of. Some of the books, forms, etc. referred to are no longer available. I also do not agree totally with Mr. Allen's opinion of using Mutual Funds as an investment tool. That said, however, the reader should not take the information provided lightly. Mr. Allen has created a simple way of explaining wealth expanding strategies that everyone can understand."
1,Careful what you read,I started to read this book. Then found out the author has had numerous tax troubles with the IRS and filed for bankruptcy in may of 96. So I can not continue to read this. To take his advice would be like listening to an insane person telling me how to be sane!
1,Poor customer service.,the product was delayed. Despite cancellation the company sent the product anyway. After returning the product they have yet to credit my account for a charge incurred on this battery. Attempts to contact the company have been very difficult.
3,not exactly the same as the 90's perfume,It smells alright but just doesn't seem to be exactly the same formula that I bought in the 90's. It is stamped 2008 on the box so maybe they tried to replicate It...
1,ewwwww,"I got this product since my mom used when I was a kid, it smelled so good that when I saw was available here I rushed in to get it, I was dreaming with it for days and when I finally got it home I opened the package with the biggest desire to wear it......OMG the experience was awful, I got a headache right away, and of course I never opened it again, I cant say that was just me cause I told my best friend to try it too and she thought the same, so at first I thought i was making a wonderful, great, smart.. deal cause it was so cheap, but at last turn out that I wasted 17 dollars :(, I hope this rewiew help u to make a good choice.... for ur own good, Pick something else..."
1,Left Wing Garbage,"I bought this book by mistake. I tried to make the most of it but only made it half way through its liberal empty spiritual new age speak. I threw it in the garbage after reading on page 59-60 (A couple of years ago, the World Economic Forum sent teams to major think tanks around the world. The researchers concluded that at the root of capitalism is spiritual bankruptcy, a conclusion that has been recognized by individuals around the worlds.) But I guess capitalism doesn't include THEIR BOOKS AND PROGRAMS THAT THEY MAKE MONEY FROM-blank out."
5,"standring's ""velvet"" touch","I first heard chris standring's ""velvet"" on jazz trax with art good 2 years ago. i ended up buying the cd and i was impressed with the talent of this young man! the title track ""velvet"" is only a taste of the beauty of this guy's guitar, to get you going you have to listen to ""nuff said"" as well as ""steven"" two other songs on this album i became hooked on after the first listens to them. standring's guitar playing and the hip-hop,jazz,he puts together on this album makes this album a bonafide must have, for you guitar fans, go out and get ""velvet"" it is a [price] you will not regret spending"
4,Funky Weather Channel Groove,"Every morning, over breakfast and paper, I tune in the Weather Channel for both near term and long term forecast and the highlight of it all is the funky sounding 36 hour forecast backed by what I call the ""funky weather channel groove"" sound. I have been wondering what this sound really is and where it comes from and this CD has it nailed. Now what I want to do is make a tape of it and then voice it over with stuff like ""rain showers likely, with possible thunderstorms"" or ""gradually clearing and warmer""."
4,"Review of Chris Standring's ""Velvet""","I really like this jazzy album especially Track 5. It is a good blend of upbeat, funky, and melodic tracks that will put you in a positive mindset any time of the day.Veronica Jackson"
4,Just the sort of music to listen to after a hard day,"Listening to velvet just melts my troubles away. A great CD. Just when you thought there were no more great jazz guitarists, along comes Chris. Lets hope he can make it over to the u.k real soon."
3,Soft but with a hard centre...,"Chris Standring serves up some typically laid-back guitar grooves on an album that falls into the distinctly ""pleasant background music"" zone - all very charming but coming dangerously close at several points to being skilfully bland. But... hidden in here is something very different - track 5: ""Velvet"". Its title suggests more of the same but it is in fact a bustling, highly distinctive hip-hop/jazz work-out that shows how Standring's softly melodic guitar playing can be made much more interesting & creative when it's mixed into a more complex, harder hitting arrangement. A stand-out track that keeps this album's head above the comfortably lush waters that threaten to swamp it."
3,OK....could be better built,"I bought this cuz my original shorted out. It was basically an exact OEM replacement of the original, however, within 3 weeks, the plastic/rubber cord casing cracked right down by the electrical plug. I was not being abusing or yanking it out of the outlet or anything like that. The whole entire length of the cord just feels really stiff, and prone to cracking. Much more so than my original AC adapter. Anyway, the nice thing about it is a)the cord is LONG and b) the box doesn't get super hot like other adapters have a tendency to do. That was a major complaint of OTHER off brand AC adapters that I considered. They overheat and then quit working. THIS one doesn't seem to have the propensity to do that. As far as the cracked cord, a little electrical tape repair and I'm still in business. Works fine. No plans to replace it till it croaks."
3,"Get ""On the Sunny Shore"" instead","First things first. This book is the same story as ""On the Sunny Shore"". A different translator, but otherwise identical. So don't buy both!Anyway, this is really a short story or novelette. It's well-written, of course, but rather slight. I enjoyed it, but this is my favorite author. I'd recommend only to Sienkiewicz completists."
4,J-Pop via Scandinavia and London!!,"Hideki Kaji is like the Japanese Davy Jones. Full of beatles-esque, abba-esque, monkees-esque pop fun, with that J-pop sound. And how could anyone that has Sarah Cracknell guest star on his album be bad? She sings a duet with him called ""Tokyo To London"" which is a cute little love story about drinking coffee, holding hands and shopping. His records are released in Japan on the Trattoria Record Label, which is Cornelius' record label. however, I wouldn't compare him to Pizzicato 5, Cornelius or any of the other most well known J-Pop artists. He has more of a song writing skill, and more of a live sound. Very beach boys, very ""boy with guitar, la la la, doo doo doo"". Catchy, fun. I can't believe he's not more popular than Cornelius or Pizzicato 5, his sound is so much more accessible and fun."
5,Great Moby Single,"Moby is the greatest techno DJ ever produced by the United States. He is able to blend so many styles into his music. Take this single for example. Moby offers up five mixes and the orginal mix of Go. The mixes are all great. Each has its on style and sound while staying true to the orginal song. My personal fav is the Woodtick Mix. I gave this 5 stars since it is the best Moby single out there. Well worth the money, so order it! *_*"
2,A Strange Conclusion,This book is supposedly the autobiography of the author's experience in the Vietnam War. But it has a rather bizzare conclusion: the author alleged that China is now a threat to world peace and may well bring the world to another World War!!The author then proposed that surrounding asian countries ally themselves to the West( ie. USA ) to encircle and contain China.This anti-China rheotric is totally irrational and paranoid. I hope that the author will further explain his weird theory in future editions of this book.
1,As Much As I Love AFS...,"This DVD is not as deep as other DVD's out there. So much of the stuff is either repetative, or really really stupid. There is one scene where they spent 10 minutes hitting the drummer, Nash, and another 10 trying to order at a drive thru. Some scene's are just over done, and it seems like the clip of ""Dreams to Make Believe"" bridge gets played about 912 times as part of their live shows.Don't get me wrong, i love the band, but this DVD could, and should have been a whole lot better."
4,Colorful and informative,"""Hawaii: Facts and Symbols,"" by Emily McAuliffe, is a good reference book for both younger and older readers. It is divided into short, easy-to-read sections and is illustrated throughout with many colorful photos. Also included is a map.The book covers a number of topics: population, crops, the state seal, state motto, state bird, etc. Included is a short list of places to visit (such as the USS Arizona memorial) and other supplements. The one thing that's missing, and which I think should have been included, is a list of famous people from Hawaii. But overall, a concise and interesting book."
4,sociology dictionary,Very easy to read and understand. Will come in very useful for my studies into this subject.
5,Useful Sociology Resource,"I have found this to be a useful resource. Perhaps there are better, but this is surely a bargain for the money."
2,Not what I expected,"I had wrongly assumed that *dictation* would come with this book, as that is what it said in the write-up. It didn't. It's a workbook, and as far as workbooks go, it seems ok."
3,Good book!,I think this is a very well written book. I think that Walter Dean Myers is an amazing writer and that it is great he found this fantastic girl that many have never heard of.
5,I cannot agree with the previous couple reviewers,"This is the most exciting music I've heard in years. Unfortunately I live in an area where you rarely hear music other than hip-hop, country, or Mexican channels. Heaven forbid you hear some new music that has a decent beat and doesn't come from the US in this area. Anyway, I had not been exposed to any of the ""hype"" of Franz Ferdinand and happened to hear a small clip of ""Take Me Out"" on KROQ (LA radio channel). I immediately liked the different sound of this band as well as the smooth, sexy voice of the singer, Alex Kapranos. I bought the album and have not been able to take it out of the cd player since (2 weeks now). I love the upbeat nature of the songs as well as the lyrics that are sometimes odd but catchy. I love the somewhat retro sound and look of the band and scream out ""it's about time"" everytime I listen to the cd. I'm just going on my gut about this band and it says it wants more!"
1,"Bland, pretentious, repetitive, and lame","""In the settlement of New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's investigation of Sony BMG Music Entertainment last week, the ugly side of an industry was exposed -- again. Sony e-mails revealed what Spitzer called a 'pervasive' practice of payola, or bribes for radio airplay."" That quote was from a story that broke on August 9, 2005 by NPR's Neda Ulaby, and one of the albums cited by Spitzer's investigation was this Franz Ferdinand record. Any album that had to bribe it's way onto the charts deserves to have the crap kicked out of it. This is what I would refer to as ""canned music."" My artistic standards are a little more lofty than this. Sorry, but in spite of its bright moments, I refuse to give this album any stars. This record MUST be punished. The hell with major labels. They should burn in hell."
4,this CD makes me smile,"I originally heard of Franz Ferdinand from Liquid Radio and totally fell in love with ""Darts of Pleasure""....then ""Take Me Out"" came out and i knew i had to buy this CD. It is pop-y, fun, and nice to sing and listen to. Even better: they are German....so my boyfriend can sing to it! :)"
1,really bad,"This is a perfect CD for people who don't have any taste in music, but want to drop the name of the CD just to look cool. It sucks... really."
1,Take who out?,What a yuppie band!Are you guys serious? Gave this album 5 stars??Interpol and the killers and modest mouse and THIS band should stop! Only rich people or wanna be rich people listen to this crap.
3,Worth the price,"If I could give three and a half stars I would. The band did well in having ""Take Me Out"" as their first single but the second-""This Fire"" sort of surprised me. I happen to think it inferior to the rest of the album with the exception of ""Cheating"". Overall the CD is fairly enjoyable."
5,Great album!,Why is it a 4 star rated album? Simple. Cos we're not in the 90's anymore where britpop ruled the earth. Same way why it hasn't been played on tv (atleast in the USA) nor in the radio due to because now these days whatever that's CRAP will get mote attention. This is a tasty britpop album with some Blur ingredients in it. If you're a britpop fan and don't own this record then you're no britpop fan at all.
3,The Strokes meet Great Britian,"This is a very familiar sound... one that we heard with the strokes, so it's not really all that new. The lead singer reminds of the guy who sings ""Puttin' on the Ritz."" The songs consist of catchy guitar riffs played repeatedly over great drum beats. They're hooky tunes with little to say, but it's just good fun."
5,Explosive mix,"This band brings light into the world of popular music. Everybody can find something for himself in it - personally, FF reminds me of The Cure. They have rediscovered forgotten way of composition - strain-building, rock riffs and, above all, PULSE! It's an explosive mix..."
5,Franz Ferdinand blows you away...,"This CD is full of catchy, totally get-up-and-move-your-body-even-if-it's-so-bad-it-doesn't-even-qualify-as-dancing songs! (Ok, that mostly applied to me...) These four guys sure bring a sweet addition to the scene! You won't regret buying this CD! I know I didn't!"
4,Wow,"I work in a bike shop on the weekends...near the college campus...Franz Ferdinand is not something I am normally exposed to, but since someone always has their iPod plugged into the stereo in the back room, I'm getting exposed to a lot of new stuff. Among the new stuff is, of course, this album, which has grown on me very quickly. At first listen, it reminds me a lot of 80's pop, and sometimes it sounds horribly horribly derivative, but when you pause and actually listen to what's playing, you'll find a suprisingly original and good album. (I'll be buying my copy on the iTunes Music Store, though, thanks.)"
2,blown away then just blown,"i had heard ""take me out"" SO many times before getting the cd. i really like that song for its inventive sounds and great vocals. then i heard the full cd. the rest is so very dissapointing. apart from take me out the only thing i liked was Jaqueline and not that much."
5,Four guys from Europe? familiar...,"Well, many great debut bands earmark this year, and Franz Ferdinand stands out as one of the most prominent of these..This Scottish four-piece has come together to make a fine album. Songs like Take Me Out gain the radio play, but others such as Matinee and This Fire deserve high praise as well, as they may be the better songs.My radio DJ once said if there is one album to get then get Franz Ferdinand. Well, I would have to agree, because pop or not this band is precociously good."
4,ok this album is pretty damn ok...,"franz ferdinand are like this year's britney spears of ""indie"" rock. last year was yeah yeah yeahs, and the year before was the strokes. i love all these bands and own all the music they have put out, but these bands are far too derivative to be ""saving"" rock n roll, or making any real mark in music other than the fact that they are all pretty ok and are somewhat popular (shock! decent music selling records?!?)and they are being hailed as rock messiahs in a britney-ruled music world. which i guess is a bit of a feat. hmmmmm. ok im rambling. this album is pretty great, they sound like stripped-down, less distorted vocals strokes. its good stuff. ""michael"" is f***ing great. so i guess buy it. these guys deserve your money more than britney or sum 41. and hey, they get indie cred by being great friends with belle and sebastian. and one last thing... how come ""take me out"" starts out AWESOME, then gets really lame?"
2,FireFireFireFireFireFireFireFireFireFireFire,"If you like music where the lyrics consist of the same four words repeated for five minutes straight, buy this album.

3,It's ok,"I guess I'll be one of the few that says that this album isn't the second coming of Jesus. I mean, I like it and appreciate the creativity in the sounds...but they don't rise to the top as one of my favorite new bands as a result. I still prefer the sounds of Interpol, The Killers, The Unicorns, etc. It's a CD that I can listen to if someone has it on, but I didn't feel the obsessive drive to go out and buy it when I heard a song from it. I completely disagree with the first review of them being way above and beyond Interpol. This coming from someone who loves the 80's music, including The Cure, Depeche Mode, etc. etc."
4,"Good, but gets old quickly","I got this album for free from a friend. That was pretty cool, considering ""Take Me Out"" had been my favorite song for a couple months. Excited, I listened to it and fell in love. The music is very unique and I liked the album because it didn't really seem to follow a formula. But, now, I'm extremely tired of the album. There are a few songs that I just love, like ""Micheal"" which is awesome and hilarious, but I never pop in this CD. My point is, Franz is good, but not great. I would consider it download-worthy and definately worth getting if it's on sale."
2,fairly dull neo-new wave band,"nothing very special about this, their melodies all sound vaguely familiar, their lyrics are pretty lame, their songs are catchy yet easily forgettable....reminds me of the strokes, in terms of over-hyped lameness....blah....check out some better scots, like arab strap, Mogwai, idlewild, etc."
5,Incredible!,"These four are absolutely brilliant. If I could write music (and I can't) this would be what it would sound like. Maybe these four would be nothing apart, but together they are masterful. There is not a weak song on this album. They are The Beatles, the best of the 80s & 90s all wrapped into one. I have listened to this for 3 months solid and can't get tired of it."
5,Heard it on madden-now enfatuated,"This was a great album i like every song on this cd, i have not bought their sophmore cd hopefully a slump is not in the future."
2,nu-new-wave,"Just what we needed, The Strokes meets Duran Duran. To be honest the album is a fun listen the first few times, but due to it's pointless lyrics and just general shallowness it gets old fast. The songs all sound very samey aswell."
3,a fun record..3.5 stars!,"i picked up ""franz ferdinand"" after ""this fire"" was a single. it wasn't the kind of thing i usually listen to but i liked the singles i had heard. from the second the bass and drums kick into the first track (which is about 40 seconds into it) i was hooked. every song is as good or better than the one before it.my favourite songs are ""jacquilen"", ""dark of the matinee"", ""take me out"", ""darts of pleasure"" , ""michael"", and ""40"". the other songs are all really good too. but they lack a bit of soemthing.in all this album is very nicely made. if it was more my kind of music i probably would have given it 5 star. i can't wait for this band's sophmore album ~ in its self the fact that a new band could create soemthing this fresh and entertaining gives us hope that pop music may finally be leaving this hip hop / crappy ""punk"" phase. sure franz copied a lot of people. but they did it very well."
4,"Fun dance band, good record","...but I agree, this album is a bit overhyped. There are plenty of talented artists out there with better lyrics, music, whatever. Mostly I hear this band associated the Killers, but the Killers are flat out pop trying to be indie (although I do admit to liking some of their songs...dead catchy, they are). This CD features quite a few good songs, and, as I've said, is a great dance record. You know those days where you just want something to get you moving, cheer you up, sort of. My favorite track would have to be ""Michael"", hands down, because it's funny, witty, and so energetic. Better than ""Take Me Out"", IMO. The guitar work is nothing new, and the vocalist's voice is typical, similar to the likes of Interpol. Overall, four stars. Nothing spetacular, but enough to warrant a recommendation. Just don't buy it because of all the hype...or the fact that they were invited to the Grammy's."
3,bad rock or good music?,this album is a return to the dark side of the 70s where rock slowly evaproated into whatever the heck the 80s were. The only way to describe this album is Disco Rock as it fuses catchy beats with wicked guitar riffs. The band evokes KC and the Sunshine Band and Blondie (especially on the track Come On Home) yet has enough skill to make sure you know that this is definitely something different. The album is consistently fun and full of energy and has enough hooks to be worth your money.
2,Just like the Strokes,"Why do I fall for the British press' exclamations of the ""next big thing?"" My simplistic review is that these guys sound almost exactly like the Strokes. From the guitar sound to the way the vocals are recorded.I was hoping for something new, different, or at least rocking. The FF cd is none of these."
1,Don't believe the hype,"I was prepared to love this cd, after reading the glowing reviews. But I don't. The songs just aren't there for me. Nothing here has a hook that grabs me, or an interesting vocal melody or lyric that sticks in my head. I have incredibly diverse taste in music, I can listen to literally almost anything, but this is just plain old over-hyped nonsense. If this is the future of Rock N Roll, God help us all."
2,Just another hot hot heat,"I've given this album a lot of chances. While having my baths. Driving my moped. Scoping chicks. And it kills me to say this, but I really feel like they're just another Hot Hot Heat (a Canadian band from the Vancouver area- it rains there a lot so bring an umbrella if you ever visit). Their fifteen minutes of fame is in countdown mode and soon they'll be joining a festering pile of fried marsbars, Haggis poutine, and other Scottish contributions to the world. But, hey, this is just one man's opninion"
1,They do write catchy songs. But so does Britney Spears.,"Franz Ferdinand's shallow debut album is arguably the worst thing that has happened to Rock'n Roll Revival so far. If they're too lazy to give any meaning to what they do, maybe we should feel too lazy to buy their records. Who said danceable music has to be music of no importance? Buddy Holly, The Beatles, New Order, Pulp... All proved you don't have to sell out to produce amazing disco tunes. I wasn't surprised to learn that Franz Ferdinand took half of their inspiration from Duran Duran. Bands who make danceable music for the sake of it ain't what Rock'n Roll needs!"
1,What?,"Basically it is just another band playing under the genre name of ""rock n roll"" who is very far from it.The only plus this album has is that the main verse for ""Tell Her Tonight"" is completely ripped off from the Richard Hell & The Voidoids song ""Liars Beware"" and that doesn't say much for originality. If you're looking for something good, then don't buy this, try reaching back to something actually before the 1970's and you might find something real."
1,How they got a record deal boggles my mind,"How does a band with A.)zero talent, B.)..... well ok i have dont have a B, but i mean common. These guys are horrible, i could play all things they play when i was about 10. The simplistic songs arent even catchy, even the strokes have some hits. Why are people buying this record!?! please if im missing something tell me!"
2,New music that still pretty much sucks,"This is bad... It's significantly better than other new music out today and they are able to pull off a few catchy rhythms (so I'll give it 2 stars), but for the most part this is bad music. Anyone who bases their musical taste on appreciation for skill, songwriting, variation, replay value, and depth in albums will not like this band. Given a few guitar riffs per song and some drum and bass samples I could see someone recreating the entire album on a computer. Sorry to crap on your taste, but wake up: this is not good music. There is very little good new music being released. You probably like this more than you should because on a relative scale of new realeases it is near the top. On an absolute scale it is probably 2 stars."
3,Something missing,"Franz Ferdinand is the kind of band that has instant appeal. The first time I heard the album... I knew I was going to like it. Its a fun rock CD, with a ""Genghis Khan - Moscow"" feel to many of the songs. They have great character on stage and the hooks and lines are really fantastic.But there is something about Franz... something lacking. It may be its formula to songs... or just maybe because they are always played alongside MTV's Britney, Steffani and Nelly...etc.I always catch myself skipping the songs half way through the track... even though I like them. Maybe its because the songs are so mono-tone, the intensity rarely dropping or raising. Each song plays the same from beginning to end.In the end... Ive found that I tell people I like Franz Ferdinand but Ive noticed I barely listen to it."
4,Give this one a chance,"Franz Ferdinand is one of those bands that can take a bit of getting used to. I bought it because I thought ""Take Me Out"" was just a catchy tune and hoped the rest of the CD would be much the same. Well, after listening to it a few times I did warm up to the rest of the songs.Franz Ferdinand are a bit difficult for me to categorize. But, they are best described as edgy, retro, and plain fun with their heavy guitars and light lyrics. Their sound is a little bit different and I think that works to their benefit.I suggest this CD to anyone who just wants to rock out and enjoy some slightly quirky songs. I somehow don't think this one will disappoint.My picks for the catchiest songs: Take Me Out, Michael, Come On Home, 40'"
3,not bad - Kind of funky,this record's not bad- but doesn't live up to all they hype. The songs are catchy enough but only slightly funky. At times the grooves are strong but there are no killer lyrics and hooks to match it. The front man is cute and that helps.I think the band has promise and will be worth following to see what they put out next. If you like guitar- funky -european music this record will do the trick.
3,"Well, I don't hate it....","What can I say? I got this album as a gift after mentioning my desire to give it a listen sometime. I listened to this album for 2-3 days of casual play, and ...I feel as if I'm done with it entirely. Some of the songs on the CD are catchy. Take Me Out was the track that lured most people into purchasing the cd, and other than this little number, nothing kept me listening. I have since retreated to the reliability of Modest Mouse and REM. I'll give this group a more cautious second glance if they release another album in the future."
4,The Return of Art Rock,"These Scottish lads sound like the descendents of David Byrne and the Talking Heads to me - and I like it! It is nice to have something to combat the doldrums of the ""Nickelback Era"" where many of the current crop of largely interchangeable modern rock bands seem to struggle to find some personality. This is a great album, and highly suggested summer listening!"
3,Decent Debut,"The debut album for Franz Ferdinand is a lot of fun and I particularly enjoy listening to it. The main problem I have is after 4 songs you begin to notice that all of the songs have the exact same drum beat and disco cool punk guitar riffs. Yeah it sounds good, but it is not nearly as inventive and fresh as the head reviewer promotes it as. At least switch things up a bit. It's light, fun, but lacking the motivation to move beyond that. I look forward to a future release when we will see if something new comes to light."
5,Ich heiße superfantastisch!!!,"Without out a doubt an amazing album. If you like anysort of punk or rock or anything thats half decent you have to buy this record. This is one of my favourite records and one of the most catchy and creative. Its amazing pop music, thats very stylish and simply divine. You cant relly compare them to other bands but if the most relavent would have to be Josef K, Belle and Sebastian and recently Bloc Party (who franz had a hand in getting exposure). Franz are one of the best bands of the past 5 years and are the cuolmination of every single band NME ever liked. Just get it!"
3,The new Duran Duran.,"This album is fun, great, and would probably spark less controversy if people would realize it's just music and it won't change your life. I think they people who give FF a bad review were expecting them to be the next Belle and Sebastian or Smiths or something. FF are a fun dance band, and THAT'S IT. Buy and enjoy. And especially enjoy the John-Taylor-esque bass lines! Duran Duran would be proud."
3,Solid Album,"I first heard Franz on the raido this summer: great energy and wonderful dance floor aesthetic. Recently however, I went to their concert. Awsome. It made me go out and get this disc but I also realized that there is something a little too homogeneous and dark about the production. That is to say, if there's potential to capture some of the feeling they create in a live show then I can't wait for the second album."
3,The Scottish Pulp?!?!,"I, like most people, bought this cd based on my liking of ""Take Me Out."" I'm a huge fan of the British band Pulp and felt the singers voice and the music reminded me so much of Jarvis Cocker and his band. He especially pulled on Mr. Cocker, I felt with ""Michael"" and ""Matinee.""While the cd does have some high moments, ""Tell Her Tonight,"" ""Come On Home,"" ""Take Me Out,"" and my personal favorite, ""Matinee,"" the album comes off as sounding rushed at some points. Would I see them live? Most probably. There's something about a group whose band members know how to dress when they really aren't required to. However, I would think twice about purchasing another one of their cds."
3,"mediocre, enjoyable","Peppy and danceable, of course. One of the more fun albums of last year. It doesn't have much staying power, though. I was pretty bored after the first handful of listens. I'll listen to it once every now and then but, really, there's only so much this band can say. The best track is probably the first one (don't judge my review based on the fact that I said the first track was the best...I have listened to the whole thing several times...). The opening couple phrases might remind you a bit of The Velvets but then it gets pretty raucous. But, like I said, old comparatively quickly.If you're looking for something in the same sort of retro-dance...uh...genre...you may want to try the new Interpol LP, ""Antics."" Sure, it's not quite as upbeat or rockin' in a genitals-flailing sort of way, but it hits upon the Franz Ferdinand sound without turning it into a monotony, as Franz themselves tend to."
1,Just the latest in a long line of recent throwaway bands,"Franz Ferdinand is without a doubt one of the most horrendous discs to pelt my eardrums in years. What makes it worse is the fact that outlets such as MTV are touting them as, for example, ""Buzzworthy"". The problem with such practices is that it seems every band to emerge in the past two or three years which doesn't sound like Creed is labeled this way.Bands such as The Strokes or The White Stripes aren't doing anything for music other than sounding different from Blink 182 and Britney Spears. They're not necessarily good bands. They're only different from the other crap that we've been abused with in recent years. The music industry is in a funk and we're being punished because of it with bands such as Franz Ferdinand.On the other hand, Franz Ferdinand's music isn't THAT bad. It just sounded a lot better in 1983 when it was something new and performed by Duran Duran."
2,Acchh Pleeez!,"I'm always astonished how certain kinds of music can create such a buzz and be so incredibly bad. I don't think I've ever seen a band that had so many comparisons made to other bands. When I saw a review mention The Jam, I nearly lost it! How do you dare even consider comparing the genius writing of Paul Weller to this stuff? I agree with several other reviewers that this music will be forgotten in a very short time and another review that comments on the incredibly weak lyrics.Sometimes people try too hard to act like they're on top of the latest music trends and if that means endorsing mediocre music so be it.I guess it is a good sign that more people are searching for a true alternative to the mainstream crapola but when something is compared to 40 different bands and still isn't as good as any of them... you do the math."
4,FF review,"Good album, came in warped but otherwise in good condition. The seller said I could return it, but I decided I could live with it."
3,i'm only pretty sure that i can't take anymore,"Nothing this addictive can be good for you. These songs are so catchy - FF are like the pop artists of a genre that can't really be called pop (in the US, at least). Yet, no matter how well-crafted this album is, it'll wear you out long before you wear it out. Burn it off a friend, but don't spend your money."
5,All Surprises,"Although I love music, I usually just listen to it on the radio. I bought this album and I fell in love with it. A lot of the songs are very exciting in that they start out with a particular sound or feel and then change into something different that you weren't expecting.While I listen, I often find myself tapping my foot to the beat. The lyrics are very interesting- a very cheerful sounding song can actually be saying something rather sad once one stops to take notice of the words. ""Take Me Out"" and ""Dark of the Matinee"" are probably my favorite songs, but they're all notable. The album seems to flow from one song right into the next, but that's not because they sound the same. It's just a logical progression. I look forward to hearing what Franz Ferdinand has in store for us in the future."
3,Gang of 4 not quite,"They are not bad, more guts than a lot of today's popular music. But they can't quite pull it off. Not as edgy or inventive as the Gang of 4 or the Jam. Has to be what these guys were listening to. Give them credit for ambition and good taste really a 3.5 get the Gang of 4 brief history cd and hope this group can rise up to that level eventually. If not it still beats the crap of anything you'd hear on top 40 corporate radio. Silly people they thought Napster was killing the industry. It's just the lack of interesting music. Franz is a baby step in the right direction."
2,I...just...don't...get...it....,"Like the Broken Social Scene, I've given this album repeated plays only because it gets such stellar reviews from people I trust. That being said, I can't get past the fact that this album has maybe 2-3 decent songs, plenty of filler, and a few tracks that are downright unlistenable."
1,Gay is the new cool...,"...and these guys are the coolest band around. I love listening to art-house bands like this and pretending to be smart right along with them. Their faux-art music videos and angular guitar work allow me the freedom to make my friends think I'm smarter than them...too bad they won't hang out with me anymore because they're at least smart enough to realize how boring Franz Ferdinand is. In addition to being derivative of any number of post-punk bands, they even had the foresight to rip a riff straight from Led Zeppelin's ""Trampled Under Hoof."""
2,don't believe the hype...,"If you dig franz's popular single ""take me out"" (it can be heard frequently on mtv), you should probably enjoy the album. If not, stay away..."
3,Uneven But Fun,"Although I was a college student in the 80's, I don't automatically get all warm and fuzzy when I hear of an 80's retro trend. I bought this album on the strength of ""Take Me Out,"" and was rather surprised by the Rutgers flashbacks I experienced. I can't say that my hand stays off the skip button, but it has entered my heavy rotation. Don't look to it for deep lyrics or world changing innovation, but certainly turn to it for a very good time. Nicely crafted, danceable pop."
5,my oh my oh my...,"i'm sure you've heard about them by now...and yes, all the hype is true. they rock, and you just cant deny it. very catchy, very hyper, very dance-able. buy it, you will love it, you will let your hair down and dance like no one is watching."
1,Probably the worst band of the time of terrible bands,"THIS BAND SUCKS. tHEY ARE SO STERIOTYPE OF TODAY'S ""ROCK"". they are very untalented and are major POESERS. If u want real music check out GRUNDGE, 80'S PUNK, 70'S MUSIC OVERALL, 60'S, AND EARLY TO MID 90'S THTS REAL ROCK 4 U NOT THIS WANNABEE MATERIAL"
1,"Please, Take Me Out too","Take Me Out. Geee, I wish somebody had done that to me before I had listened to this piece of crap. I don't know what to call there style of music except it's crap. And to the Grammys I have one question, HOW N DA H&!! Did these guys get nominated in the same catagory as Green Day? I listened ""This Fire"" and heard NO drums,Not a single drum. Hey Franz heres a hint, Ringo Starr and Tommy Lee,do I need to say anything else? Drums make good Rock music. Listen to my advice fans of Rock, if your in the mood for headbanggin',bicflickin' Rock, Buy ""American Idiot"" from Green Day, If for some reason you weren't, Buy this. It's not Pop, It's not Rock, It's crap."
2,what in the hell was pitchfork thinking?!,"This album, quite simply, is crap. It's boring and, at best, mediocre. I tried and tried to get into this, not wanting to miss out on what was hailed as such a great disc. But I just don't get it."
3,GOOD BUT...,"I think Franz Ferdinand is one of those bands that have one or two hits and then will totally dissapear. So I will say that this is just an average album that will be forgotten in some time. Their debut ""Take me out"" is pretty good also some songs on the album 2 or 3, but after you start hearing the album a lot of times it starts to get boring and in some point you will stop listening to it. If you want to have some fun for some days this is ok, but if you are looking for a CD for your Cd collection or for a masterpiece this isn't for you."
5,SCOTLAND HAS SHOWN ITS SUPREMACY AGAIN!!,"AT FIRST IT SOUNDED LIKE THE KILLERS. no way... IT ISNT. 1000% BETTER. ITS ALOT MORE LIVELY AND IT GIVES U A FEALING TO RUN.. (IF U WANT MAJOR WEIGHT LOSS, LISTEN TO THIS) I EXERSIZE WITH THIS FOR HOCKEY AND I DROPPED 5 LBS.. GREAT STUFF FOR PARTIES, REALLY GETS YOU GOING"
2,Give Me A Break,"1 good song (Take Me Out) does not a great band make!And by the way what the hell is a homoerotic dance punk bliss anyway? This is the kind of band you'd have at your prom back in the 80's. Of course since most of today's music is so bad it's not even funny, you get press hyping glorified bums like FF beyond belief. I heard people in subways play better."
2,Another overhyped Great British Hope,"My goodness, people listen to this by choice? I hear very few redeeming qualities besides a lot of spiky, punk energy reminiscent of the early eighties new wave bands. There's little of the invention that characterized the New York scene, though. These guys would have been better off taking another 4-5 years to put their ideas and musical chops together. Now on the album-tour-album cycle, I don't know how they'll do the growth necessary to make the music any better. Time will tell, I suppose."
1,heard it and sold the CD,"When I went to buy this CD I thought it was gonna be simply one band's take on all the 80's rock. I didn't realize it was gonna be exactly the same. Franz writes some great lyrics although the content pointed to some dirty stuff sometimes. ""Michael"" makes me want to throw up. The beats could have me jumpin' around the room but ""Take Me Out"" was not like the rest of the songs. I've heard that song on the radio for a long time and loved it...but the rest of the CD is not like that one song. If you are a fan of clean rock music, you won't like this CD. It has some nasty things going on in there. When I first put it in my stereo, it didn't sound REALLY good because it has already been done! If you want to hear a fresh sound, don't pick up this CD. If you like exact copies...GO FOR IT!"
5,Fanstic Album!,"I was first turned on to Franz Ferdinand when they were on tour with Interpol last year. I am a big Interpol fan, but I really got into FF from the first time I listened to them play.FF is an import from Glasgow, Scotland, and they are talented as hell. The guitar driven, fast paced drum beats and melodious lyrics are phenomonal. It has that lo-fi garage sound to it that feels raw and unbridled.I think that if you really like the Strokes, Interpol, Joy Division, etc. you will like this album a lot. There are no filler songs on this album. Each and every song is awesome. This album puts me in a good mood every time I listen to it. I like to listen to FF when I am running because it is catchy and fast paced. When I am listening to them, I totally forget that I am running. So, purchase this album and Good Luck. I hope that you will love it as much as I have."
5,Fantastic!!!!!,This is one INCREDIBLE band! It's like a mix of The Clash and The Cure with a lot of other great flavors. I can't say enough good things about this band! Thank God for some GREAT new music!!
5,Take this album out!,"Ok, it is official. The new sound of alternative rock is to sound like punk/modern rock bands from the late 70's to the early/mid eighties. The Stills sound like Joy Division, and now Franz Ferdinand sounds like the Talking Heads. Even the video for ""Take Me Out"" screams Talking Heads. This is not bad because I grew up listening to this type of music, and I would rather listen to it even if it is recycled. These top 40 pop songs and boy bands of today are so annoying that to me listening to Ferdinand is a pure blessing."
3,"enjoy 6 songs out of 11 tracks - great pop, but not timeless","i agree with the bittersweet reviews. this album has some kick ass songs on it (notably ""take me out"", ""jacqueline"", and ""come on home""), but fails to stay afloat with repeated listens.i don't agree with the strokes comparisons or the interpol comparisons - the only thing FF has in common with those bands is the size of the hype that they have received.franz ferdinand got together to write ""songs girls can dance to"" and i feel like they've done a great job. put this album on in the background at a party and everyone will be asking you what it is. put this album on with headphones and stare at it for a while and you'll get bored with the repetition. i can see their next record being better if they cut out some of the fat (i.e. over-repeated hooks). this is a fad - enjoy it for it's immediacy, get sick of it for it's lack of efficiency. at least it's totally fun and dance-worthy."
3,"Simple, fun album......not much more.","I bought this album because it has been getting hyped and praised like crazy everywhere. I listen to a lot of new music and I own quite a few albums released this year, Franz Ferdinand's self titled debut is right in the middle of them all. This is no way the best album of the year but it's far from the worst. The opening track ""Jacqueline"" is one of the high points of the whole album with a really catchy guitar part that you can almost dance to, which seems to be the focus of the whole album. This album is harmless fun. Franz Ferdinand don't stretch any boudaries here, they simply stick to a formula that they seem to do well. I like this more than anything the Strokes have done but it will most likely be lost among the many far better releases in 2004."
2,Overhyped Garbage,"I love the songs Take Me Out and Auf Asche, but for the most part this album blows, and the hype is completely unjustified. The rest of the tracks sound like something Perry Farrell or the Ghandarvas had a hand in. If you like that kind of thing, than go for it, but if you like the hits you've heard, than maybe you should avoid wasting your money."
2,"you're late guys, punk is over","even if it was 1979 this album would be mediocre. but it ain't 1979 fellas. disco-punk is dead, and retro stinks. can we stop the recycling of past rock styles right now, please? if we see another album from these guys i'll be surprised. i love the lispy accent the guy fakes on the track ""michael."" i can't figure out if he's trying to sound gay, or german. how, asexual! the only good song worth any stars is ""darts of pleasure."" albums like this have an inherently limited life span. the funny thing is, the lyrics are worse than the music. if you're young and like to rock out, do yourself a favour and skip this. go buy some ""gang of four."" trendy artists like this fail to accurately reproduce, nor enhance rock styles of the past."
5,Beatles Re-born,"Franz Ferdinand is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant world of rock. With their irresistible rhythm, lyrics and sound they are leading a rock revolution the likes of which have not been seen since the Beatles held the world's attention so long ago. Like the Beatles they bring with them a sound that catches the ear and quickens the pulse. If you listen closely, Franz Ferdinand could almost pass for the Beatles re-born, except for the fact that they're Scottish.Their self-titled album keeps you listening track after track with a multitude of style and voice packed into every song. I eagerly await the next release from this time-bomb of talent!"
4,Franz Ferdinand Self-Titled,"This album is, simply put, fantastic and fun. The band members said they were going for a sound that people could dance to, but this is more than dance hall/club music. It is really good alternative rock and roll. The songs all have a similar sound, but are quite different upon true listening.The only drawback is the similar sound of all of the songs. If one doesn't like the sound of Franz Ferdinand, don't bother listening to the rest of the album. However, if one does like the sound, it's an album that's good for more than a few straight-through listen-to's in the cd-player."
2,Definitely overhyped,"I really thought Franz Ferdinand were something more than just a copy/paste of the past. Their image, album and single sleeves, music... everything is dejavu, but repackaged to be a bit more modern. Nothing sensational, inspirational or new.Two stars for not doing hip-hop, which is the worst music ever produced."
2,Where's my handbag!?,"Heh, this album just screams broadway shows, high heels, red leather dress, and bad wigs. It's been sometime since I've seen this flamboyant of a record. I'll admit, there are one or two songs here that will get stuck in your head. Now whether that's out of sheer enjoyment, or simple annoyance, you'll have to decide. I agree with the others that Franz is a take on some of the other bands out there, like The Stroke, The Vines, and all the other recent ""The"" bands. But they aren't the ones you'll be listening to on your way to the gay clubs. Get ready kids, this CD is a wild and wacky ride into sometimes scary territory."
1,I cant believe i wasted my money on this crap,There is not one thing unique about this cd at all. I cant believe people are calling this there favorite cd ever. If you want to know who Franz Ferdinand stole there sound from listen to some Led Zeppelin. And if you want some good indie rock get Modest Mouse The Lonesome Crowded West. (Trust me its not anything like Float on).
1,Hahaha,"I made a name just so I could review this piece of garbage.This whole style of calling everything ""Indie-Rock"" when it is being shown on MTV is totally contradicting itself. Obviously when one record company picked up an artist from the ""Independent"" scene, the rest follow in suit. Unfortunatly for the world It was a horrible band by the name of ""The Strokes"" who everyone things is so ""Innovative, underground"" that it makes one want to vomit just hearing it.Anyway, this album is just a rip-off of anything that looms in the underground world of music that is good.If you want ""Dance-Rock"" listen to The Faint, or Q And Not U. Not this over-produced work of some fat ceo of a mainstream rec. label who ""Discovered"" (AKA created) it."
1,Cacophony of Crap,"This is some of the worst, most destructive garbage that I've ever had the displeasure to hear. Don't buy this cd. You would be further ahead if you would just flush your money in the toilet. The ""music"" is loud, the lyrics are stupid. If you have any peace of mind, this crap will destroy it. Franz Ferdinand may have some appeal to angry young boys with an IQ below 80, but if you don't fit that description, buy something else."
3,A Pleasant Diversion,"This album is nice, fluffy Britpop. Unfortunately, that's all it is. The songs have the feel of Blur's debut album Leisure mixed with a healthy dose of funk and the Strokes yet leaving all of the soul at the door.Don't get me wrong, it would be fantastic fun to see these guys live. Their sound is full of vintage guitars and bouncy bass and Beatles reject call-out harmonies.However, singles ""Take me Out"" and ""Darts of Pleasure"" are much more sensual and catchy in six minutes than the rest of the album put together (although ""The Dark of the Matinee"" and ""40'"" are pretty good tunes). The album reminds me quite a bit of a Cake album or the Tenacious D album - a couple of great cathy tunes and some filler inbetween. While Blur or Oasis kept their albums thematic around the singles to create a cohesive hour of music, this comes off as thrown together like a collection of B-sides."
3,It's Okay,"I obviously bought this cd because of the first single, ""Take me Out"". To me, that is the best song on the album. The first time I listened to it I couldn't make it all the way through the cd without turning it off. I later gave it another try. I can't say I love it, but it is not bad. The bad thing is, sometimes it is hard to tell one song apart from the other. They all seem to have the same type of vibe to it.Overall I would say, try and listen to the album before buying it."
2,eek,"some people will just believe anything the music critics say, this is way overhyped, and every song is the same basic tempo and dance structure.no, it's not good."
3,Downhill after Take me out and matinee.,"As stated above, these two songs, tracks three and four, are very good. Unfortunately, out of the other 9 songs on the cd, I would say that there are only maybe 3 or 4 that are above average. I first bought this cd because of comparisons to the Strokes, one of my favorite bands, and unfortunately was fairly dissapointed."
2,x,I bought this album looking for something a little different for the CD rack. Unfortunately I dont like most of the tracks on this album although the singles are OK. Maybe I need to listen to it a few more times to like it... but its just not something Im prepared to do - it hurts.
5,Good Music,"Most of the songs on Franz Ferdinand are origional, good music. None of the tracks were especially bad. My favorites are Auf Achse, The Dark Of The Matinee & Take Me Out."
3,"not bad, not spectacular","If you're relatively new to music, you're likely to find this album original and amusing, if you're over 18 and even 20, you'll find it alright but definitely not a grower and probably won't listen to it more than ten times. There are melodies, a stolen rhytms and even a songwriting talent yet somehow the band sounds more like a variety artists, they have this bleak feel to them and are just one of the many recent proofs that any real attitude is essentially dead as far as the mainstream rock and roll goes, all that's left is a bunch of metrosexual dudes without much of a personality or charisma who'll be gone and forgotten soon, forget the media hype, The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys or these guys aren't any rock saviours, rock music needs no saviours, rock music needs no home improvement, rock only needs an audience and these guys don't rock."
3,O.K. I liked It.,"I tried really hard not to like this album, and I must say that I found It much more interesting most other purchases I've made. I will not end this review without saying that some of it was really repetetive, but nonetheless a worthwhile purchase. ""Take me out"" and ""Matinee"" are good but the album offers much more than the radio will let you hear. Lets hope the come out with something else next year."
2,Why all the hype?,"I bought this album before ""Take Me Out"" had hit the radio and I was disappointed from the beginning. Being a fan of the BritPop/Rock scene I thought I'd found a new gem, but this album is nothing but a boring, ho hum effort. I don't understand why this album has garnered so much attention and critical aclaim. The only standout track is ""Take Me Out"", and the rest did nothing to inspire me or really even catch my attention. I had a tough time ""getting into"" the album and gave up after 3 or 4 plays through. Franz Ferdinand just doesn't do it for me."
1,Now I know why ipods are so popular,"This CD is terrible. I bought it hoping that it would rock like the single, but the rest is moody, meandering, poorly produced and sung work. Moody is fine if it's Massive Attack or Joy Division, but not if it's a typically bad Cure cd, as this resembles. I had to check the credits to see if, as is often the case, someone different produced the single, the excellent ""Take Me Out"", while some unfocused, art school novice did the rest. But that isn't the case, so I don't know what accounts for the difference. Either way, I'm trading it in for the CD single, as I just don't want it on my shelf. It's that bad."
5,Very Satisfied,"I have been very satisfied with this Air Filter. The price on Amazon was great. Installation is easy, and I look forward to not having to clean it for many thousands of miles."
3,"Nice Book, Little Attention to Some of the Greatest Strat Players","Overall an interesting an informative book, nice pictures and good inteviews. On the low side, some players get a lot of coverage while others get almost ignored. While we see Eric Clapton and his guitars all over the book, there's just one picture and a couple of passing mentions of Ritchie Blackmore, probably one of the most talented and influential guitar players of all time. When Deep Purple was opening for Eric Clapton, Blackmore was so incredibly good that the band got paid off to leave the tour because Clapton felt intimidated to play after Ritchie in front of such guitar-oriented crowd.Still a good read. 3/5"
5,Great book from a great writer/musician!!,"This is a wonderful tribute book with a tremendous amount of research and detail. I'm probably biased since I was a student of Tom's in the mid-70's. He was a great instructor and I credit him for my love of music and the guitar which has lasted more than 35 years.All that being said, this book is a must for any serious student of rock history. The interviews and photos included in this book are first-rate quality. Frankly, I keep this book out as a ""coffee table"" book and found that most visitors to my home invariably pick it up out of fascination. Even those that aren't guitar afficianados love looking at the photos and reading about the history of this icon of modern rock history."
5,Unparalleled compendium of the most versatile solidbody guitar,"This book is a MUST for any guitar aficionado!!!!!This is an incredibly thorough compendium of the instrument that shaped the future of Rock and Roll.Very amusing and easy to read, complemented by an excellent array of photos and illustrations. The book also includes an audio CD with exclusive ""closet classic"" interviews with Leo Fender, and AWESOME Strat sounds and effects. A TRUE MASTERPIECE by a true guitar giant like Tom Wheeler."
4,An easy reader for any one,"I really enjoyed this book as a teenager and could relate to the problems in life Todd faced.Todd is 15 years old in the 10th grade. He lives in Walden Woods a nice dressed up suburb. His family moved here because they thought it was a safe sane neighborhood to raise their kids but they soon learn the reality that no place as is safe as their own house. He is not the most popular kid in school but gets by with a few close friends and his sister Diana who is the same age. Todd developes a crush on his little sister Marnie's baby sister not realizing what she was about. Todd learnes the hard way he is wrong when Laurel, the baby sitter tries and almost succeeds in [convincing] Marnie that Holloween is bad and that the Devel is everywhere. This book tought me that you don't always know people the way you think you do and that no one is as normal as you.This is an easy reader I recomend to any one out there looking for a mind bogling plot."
3,All over the place,"The concept of this book is a good one--fundamentalism doing more damage than good when a little girl's babysitter scares her with stories of devils and the evil of Halloween. Unfortunately, Richard Peck tries to tackle way too many themes, and the result is a mishmash. Topics like censorship, fundamentalist Christianity vs. liberal Christianity, and death just can't be covered in the same 300 page novel, and have justice done to any of them. It's too bad, because R.P. is usually a terrific writer."
3,Okay,"The writing style is excellent, the characters are well created, and the story itself is believable. The only problem is that some parts are boring, like the haunted house scene."
4,this book is interesting!!,"this book kept me wanting to read.This family moved out of their town that they were in to get out of the misery they had in it. They moved to a town they thought was going to be different. It was different until they found out that the sitter they have had for their daughter Marnie was telling her that witches were real, and were getting things in her head about them. Like they were real and they will come and get you. Marnie has always loved halloween until the sitter was telling her that stuff. Marnie was changing drastically, she was changing in a bad way. She was always in her room all by herself every night and every day. The family got worried and had to think of something to do.This book was interesting to read. I liked it"
2,Okay,pretty decent.. but i think one can learn a lot just by watching movies and reading a lot of comics and then analyzing them.. that way you acquire your own taste and preference in how to tell a story
5,A Comics Pro Gives It The Thumbs Up,"As a veteran comic book illustrator (You can find my work here on Amazon.com; I am the CO-creator and artist of Transmetropolitan), I am often asked to recommend books to aspiring professionals in comic book illustration. In that case I always enthusiastically recommend any of Eisner's instructional books as essential reading for anyone serious about their craft and dreams of getting into the industry.From the earliest work of his career, Will Eisner was an innovator in writing as well as illustration. Even in his twilight years the man is still a vigorous and creative artist producing work that pros as well as fans can't wait to get their hands on.These books display his genius in an entertaining and easy to follow method, and if put to practice will inspire and reveal hidden keys to making your work truly professional grade. A great companion book to Eisner's ""Comics & Sequential Art"".- Darick Roberston"
2,Way too short,"Three out of the eight movements feature a soloist. Movement three features the clarinet, movement five features the cello and movement eight is mostly a violin solo. These movements should be played slowly and be as long as possible. On this recording, movement three is great, and at 9 minutes it is about the longest clarinet solo available for this quartet. The other two movements, however, are way too short. Movement five is 4 mintes shorter than the EMI release and movement eight is 3 minutes shorter than the Haitnik rendition. It's not because repeats were not taken, it's because it's played way too fast which ruins the mood of this austere work. Get the RCA Victor recording with Serkin on piano or the Haitnik. Even the Naxos is better than this."
1,Metallica:Phantom Puppets.,This is Phantom Garbage! It is basically some Australian put together bootleg with unseen interviews from Germany and Australia and some interviews all thrown in like a compilation.
4,As good as it gets,Excellent band though this album is very slow country type music. I think Hell Bound train is a much better album
4,Remember The L!,"I picked this up as part of a nostalgia trip...I've stayed the L-Ranko in Tama/Toledo Iowa many times in past years. Funky place. This is a sweet CD in the best tradition of American story songs. Easy to listen to again and again. Huge compliments to Ms. Shore for the exceptional timing, phrasing, and soul of her vocal accompaniment. She adds depth and a nice earthiness to the tunes. Let's have more!"
2,"I wrote these songs...beware..be afraid, be very afraid","Yes, I am the guy who recorded this album. If it was actually any good, I'd still be in the music business instead of working a straight gig. There are a couple of decent songs on it that don't [stink], so for 5 big dollars used, what the [heck].If you buy it, good [darn] luck. If you are still on the fence, and I have anything to say about it, I would suggest that you go buy something like ""Gary Stewart's Greatest Hits"" or one of those boxed sets of 70's crappy hippy rock. You will be happier, trust me.*note to others, if you really know my stuff and did hear me play, well, you know that I'm the kind of guy to write a review like this just for kicks, I'm not bitter...I got to do whatever the heck I wanted to for 15 years. And on one last note, the bass player has a truly cool band called Big Wooden Radio. Now, that's good stuff."
4,good for adults,"Not sure about kids. I like them because they are not too sweet. But my kid does not like them, probably for the same reason."
5,"I'm ""Breathless""","I love this single! It's a great come-back single. It sounds very different to their other songs they've released, alot more American-ish (I guess it's 'cos of ""Mutt"" Lange) It has a less of an Irish feel to it, but still a very cool single. 5 stars out of 5!"
4,Breathless takes my breath away...,"The Corrs are back with a typically wonderful song - this time from their new album, ""In Blue"". It is a smooth and flowing follow-up to ""Radio"", which, whilst also being noteworthy, does not match up to this breathtaking new addition to The Corrs' hit express. Great listening!"
5,Books is getting worn out,"I came to Perl from C. Some of the good things I learnt in C (using K&R; coding style), and some of the bad things, were both dealt with in this book.This book however provides the basis for developing a coherent style framework, and avoids many of the more esoteric perl idioms that have you hunting through the manual any time you see them.As a result of reading this book, I have revised a number of my coding practices, some of which I've learnt from looking at other people's code.I have been pleasently surprised at the positive impact this is now having on the amount of time I'm spending updating older code.Very well worth the money."
2,Two Stars is Charitable,". The Indians (not `Native Americans') have a problem: where are they going to get the cows, pigs, and sheep the government representative tells them they must raise in order to keep the new house and barn on which they have been forced to move? With low finances, they must use their ingenuity to procure livestock from the woods.As moose, beaver, and bear come to their aid, the message that Native Americans are more in sync with nature comes across. The wild animals act anthropomorphic and win the Indian couple their farm.It is a mildly amusing story with watercolor illustrations that will win no Caldecotts but aren't too bad. This story is freighted with heavier meaning than children will understand or care about."
5,Awesome,"I have been so impressed. I have 4 boys that are 6,5,4,2 and I watch extra 4,3,2 year olds. It is amazing to me to watch the kids all take turns and have a blast with this set. The set is big enough for multiple kids to play and share, and will grow with their skills and creativity! I am an educator and I can see real potential with this system."
5,WOW!!! What a find!!!,"This is one of the greatest CDs that I have ever heard. The stories are really fun to listen to (they never get old), but the music really speaks for itself. The songs are all fantastic stories themselves. As I sit here listening to this CD, I feel as though I am in the studio with these folks. I highly recommend this CD to everyone on the planet. It seldomly leaves my CD player, and I think that all should experience it."
5,Very god,Bushido is a German rapper and he is the best!He is better than 50 Cent.You have to buy ths album it is the best!!!!!!!!!
5,MY 9 YR OLD LOVES IT!,"I HAVE A 9 YR OLD AND THIS HAD TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF HER FAV GIFTS FOR CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR! It is not just a book...it is a toy as it comes with several small plastic mermaids. I paid 25.00 for hers at our local aquarium...wish I had gotten a better deal, but glad I got the book."
1,I did not expect it,"I did not expect it to be so child like, I thought it was better. I guess is good for a kid but I got it as reference book.I am sending it backThanksmarineus"
2,the secret world of mermaids,This is a beautifull book but mine was defective. It had double pages of half the pages and it was a Christmas gift from Santa. Guess the elves did a bad job. Tradergirl
3,Good,"We bought this book for my 5 year-old as she has had an obsession with mermaids ever since she saw the film 'The Little Mermaid'. She just loves it - we have read it again and again to her. And we have spent many hours on beaches and riversides, leaving secret signs in the sand for any passing mermaid, searching for 'soomna' wishgiving stones, and checking out local festivals for red-hatted, web-fingered families!"
4,Spacegodzilla,"We like this toy overall. However, the back of his head was painted different than the body where they connected (white meeting dark green at the neck seam). This did not bother my son too much."
5,Not a Toy....,"Considering it's size, this is a very good FIGURE to add to any collection. This was never intended as a mere ""toy"" when purchased and hopefully will never suffer that fate. It's fully posable, and while the body is made of tough vinyl I really have my doubts if the paint-job, which it's real quality is based on, would stand up to heavy-handed use.It is reasonably priced, comes with it's tag, and makes a great display piece for those trying to fill out a Toho collection of critters.But a toy? Never...."
3,Made my Grandson Happy,"I can't say that I see the appeal of the Godzilla figures, but my grandsons are crazy about them, and Space Godzilla is what the 8 year old requested for the holidays. He carries it wherever he goes, along with his other Godzilla dolls, and seems to think they are cool, especially after watching Godzilla videos on the family computer. Space Godzilla seems to be pretty durable so far - no injuries despite being taken everywhere, unlike his Kingadorrah (sp?) figure,which got a nick in one of its necks shortly after being unwrapped. My 3 star rating may be unfair, since it's a grandmother's view of the toy, not its owner's."
5,"incredible, mesmerizing music","five stars is not enough, woob 1194 is easily one of the most creative and spellbinding pieces of music i have ever heard. i find it nearly impossible to describe it: it's a crazy blend of ambient, world music, movie and television samples and more. the other reviewers are correct about the first track, 'on earth'; it's a long and amazing journey. 'wuub' will leave you mesmerized, and 'odonna' is a gorgeous, moody piece, finishing with haunting vocals that gives me chills every time. i've listend to and owned quite a lot of music, and this is without a doubt my favorite. an essential piece of any serious music lover's collection, provided that you can find a copy."
5,Parenthood,I find myself involved with the characters and the plots.It is entertaining - the facets and dynamics are relateable
5,So relatable.,"I just love this series! As a parent of a three year old, I can immediately relate to the characters and I also feel like I'm getting a glimpse into what my own future might hold. Perfectly cast, all the actors give believable and heartfelt performances. It covers a huge range of topics without digressing into the ridiculous or impertinent. The characters also span generations, making this the perfect series for almost anyone."
5,"Funny, dramatic, serious but mostly funny","Always great laugh on this show. Even when they touch on serious adult subject matter, there's always a laugh to be had."
5,For My Wife,My wife loves this show so it was a christmas gift. She lloves it. If you like the show get it for a great price.
5,Great TV Series,All in all Parenthood is a good family drama which takes you through the day to day lives of the Braverman clan (grandparents and then the familes of their four children). The characters are memorable and the acting is pretty good.I'd recommend this DVD set to anyone who's a fan of the show or who wants to get into it.
5,One of our favorites,"Snappy dialogue that rings of real life. Great acting - from the petite Mae Whitman to the long-time cranky COACH star, Craig T. Nelson. There's not a weak member in this cast. Good soundtracks, and Ron Howard behind it all. Not surprising that it's good."
4,Makes me want to buy entire series -,"Great actors working with a great script yields an episode that is incredibly touching. In this episode, family bonds are strengthened - now it's more than just one-step relations between mom/child, or spouses or siblings, but it crosses generations and in-laws and expands to show a beautiful example of harmony.I'm halfway through this season, but Zeek's (Craig Nelson) character arc is so compelling and we see just how much heart he has, along with his passionate nature -Especially as the third generation is growing up, the comparison between teen angst of first season and maturation of the high schoolers in this season may be bit of a stretch, but with such a close, tight-knit, supportive family with honest flaws, the kids can't help but to shine brighter.Recommend this season so much. Love this episode and # 8, ""If This Boat is A Rockin' """
3,They're still changing the music for DVDs???,"I didn't actually buy this DVD set myself, but a friend did. I have a few problems with the show, but I usually try to catch it. The first thing I noticed was that the title song is different. I then checked the first season set and the title song has been changed there as well.I can't believe that the studios are still being too cheap to license the proper music for the DVD release. Why do they license songs for use in the show if they're not willing to pony up the money for the DVDs? On the other hand, if the recording industry wasn't so greedy, maybe they wouldn't feel the need to find alternative music for the DVDs.To be honest, I didn't even watch any of the DVDs once I discovered that the title song had been changed. I figured that if they couldn't even bother to use the proper music, they probably screwed up other things as well."
4,Great show!,"This show is great because it's a perfect depiction of a variety of modern families. It's got comedy, drama, and then some. Definitely worth watching!"
5,"Best show---- LOVE IT!!! ""Try it, you'll like it!""","I just love shows that are as one said on here--- ""like real life""! This show is just such GREAT acting. It's superb! I can't get enough of it. I laugh, cry.... but mostly laugh!! I love seeing the interactions and dynamics of this family. It makes you feel comforted at how we are as a human race--- the relating we do with one another. I loved the show, from the 90's, My So-Called Life... the chief complaint about it's too-early-demise was that it was too much like real life(had more known about it and had the timing been later in production it would've not been cancelled).... but just, ahh! I dont know how to explain what you're missing if you've not seen this show! Check it out and see for yourself!!"
4,Satisfied Customer,"The product:- was as pictured on Amazon,- delivered in a timely manner,- a sturdy, quality item,- priced reasonablyWhile having a canoe in a red box is a little different (instead of something like sitting in blue water), this glass work matches my decor and works."
3,It's Okay,"We bought these for our daughter who Loves butterflies, but she just wasn't really into it. If you are buying them for children to play with, I definitely recommend buying a set of butterflies instead."
5,Fosters home video game style!,"Fosters home for imaginary friends the video game is fun to play. You get to play as Bloo and Mac and interact with many of the characters from the show. Through out the game you find and collect items. It does get a little repretitive at times, but when you complete a task you are relieved. The replay value of this game is poor. There are 3 mini game that you can play, but they aren't really that fun at all. I would recommend this game to younger gamers and for gamers who enjoy the crazy world of Fosters!"
5,German Castles And Palaces,"I love this book. The photography is just fabulous. If you ever wanted to know what the German Castles and Palaces look like, or are planning a trip to Germany and would like to see some of them, this is the book for you! Also, the history is very informative. I just can't say enough for this book! I am an artist, and I have never seen such an artful display of art from a bygone era. WOW!"
