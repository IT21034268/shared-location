4,Donna Summer,"This had a lot of her songs on this 2 CD, however there are several songs that I do not remember."
4,Pretty darn good,"I am pleased to see that so much Gen1 stuff is being re-issued from the series to the comic books. I didn't get to read these as a kid due to living in Europe at the time, so these collections are great. If you're not a fan of the Transformers though the stories can seem a little hokey (like Spiderman's cameo). I like that the plot is a little more developed that the show's, and the fact that not all of the humans are thrilled with the Autobots appearance. If you like consistency there are some variations from the cartoon so be prepared. Also the end of ""Beginnings"" is a cliffhanger, so you may want to get vol 2 ""New Order"" as well. All in all it a fun ride for fans."
1,too old,Okay let me just tell you one thing this book has only the oldest transformers comics in it. It barely has any action at all in it. It has the original 1-6 transformers comics. It doesn`t have better artwork or a better story line. But if you want some old transformers comics I say go for these.
4,Great product for the price,"These speakers have awesome sound for the price. The bass is fabulous. If you want good to great sound these speakers are your choice, if you want great-CRAZY sound, then the Studio Series by JBL is your choice. Be warned, the Studio Series is almost twice as much. . ."
4,Dragon Naturally Speaking 5.0 Pref. USB,"I used an older version and found it frustrating. I bought this version, with the USB connection for clearer transmission and better performance, and I am quite impressed. I use it to dictate medical notes and it has learned most of the technical/medical terms. I have spent, probably, 5-6 hours on it training and teaching it the medical terms. It doesn't cease to amaze me at how well it does. If it makes a mistake it can be corrected and will be much less likely to make the same mistake again.The digital USB converter can be a nightmare to install!"
1,Product Doesn't Work!!,"I purchased this product to assist my daughter with school reports, etc. The program installed perfectly, the instructions were simple, clear and easily followed. The problem is the product just does not produce what it says it can. I spent 6 hours doing voice recognition readings, practicing the tutorial and still the program could not produce a simple three sentence e-mail. The quality of the voice recognition feature of the product is TERRIBLE. I recommend you not waste your time and money."
4,Cook'n Ca'jun Smoker,"The cooking ca'jun smoker is a wonderful smoker. I really enjoy using this smoker to grill all kinds of meat, fish and corn on the cob, it really does the job. My whole family like my grilling on the Cook'n Ca'jun Smoker.Mike"
3,Company did not respond,"After over two weeks of waiting, I had to ask for a refund on my purchase of this product. Stay away from this company."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this product for my wife and after just two days, the top cover is peeling away from the neoprene which makes the belt useless because there is nothing to for the velcro to grab onto. I've owned other trimming belts that were 3x as thick. This is poorly manufactured. Pay a little extra more and buy one that's constructed better."
2,Not Good,"I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt. The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off, the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off. I would not advise buying this. I was dissappointed in the quality of this product."
1,Very poor quality!,"The top layer separated from the neoprene after the first use and the belt is now useless. It was a complete waste of money, so I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for it."
4,This guy doesnt know what he is gabbing about,"This gaget does actually work if used correctly. The last guy doesnt have any idea of what he is talkinga about. Simple theory, sweat more in the target area loss fat in the same area. Wear this when you work-out but all day along with a good diet and it will work. Several of my client have had excellent results!"
1,Not very good,I have had this item for about a month now. I exercised in it four times a week and it did not help at all. The material was not strong enough and ripped apart. I would not recommend this item. I have bought and tried the McDavid waist trimmer and I liked that one way more because it was durable and it really makes me sweat. This product was not worth its money.
1,Do Not Buy,"This is a waste of money, ripped apart after two workouts on a treadmill. Will make you sweat but will break apart after a couple of uses. I purchased the valeo neoprene waist belt instead for the same price and its lasted me 3 weeks, makes me sweat even more and hasn't worn yet."
3,Gofit waist away,"After using this product for 2 weeks I have noticed that the outer layer unravels.I use it while on my treadmill and you do sweat alot around the waist which does help with the water retention. The biggest thing I have found is that it is good to wear all day long. At this point I have not lost any inches, but I have not had it long enough and will keep on using it."
3,long way from a 6-pack,"The product makes u sweat when you use it for a 1hr workout, i am 134 pounds, i have used it for a month and im still a long way from having a 6-pack... and summer is almost over :("
1,Waist belt,This is not a good product. Qualify is poor. The belt torn apart and ripped after only a few day of use.
2,fat loss,"Where do people get the idea that sweat equals fat loss. Sweat equals moisture loss. As far as losing inches, that is due to exercise, not sweating. When you rehydrate yourself with water you end up putting moisture back into the tissue of your core muscles and you have added those inches back. Exercise, exercise is the only way to lose inches. I have been wearing 3 neoprene waist belts with a weight lifters belt( cinched very tight) to exercise, because of a back condition, and my waist has been the same size( 30"") for 20 years, only because I hydrate contantly and I'm as thin as i'm gonna' be. Also, if you are not sweating during exercise you ""need"" hydartion and hydrate until you start sweating again. I rated this 2 stars because of the velcro, it always wears out, catches lint and other debris and tears up the fabric of the belt. I use zippered belts."
2,Doesn't work,I have been wearing this belt for several weeks (probably more like months) and it is doing absolutely nothing to my waist. It definetely makes one sweat but that is about it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Seems like a waste of money.
2,Very short,"This was advertised at one size fits all. It is long enough, but not tall enough. I am 5'10"", 218lbs. This belt only covers about 1/3 of my core. It would probably be perfect for a lady no taller than 5'6""."
3,Sweat away!,"The first time I used this product, I could tell a difference in my waistline. You will sweat a lot! Someone informed me I was just losing water weight though."
5,4x4-evo,"I just bought 4x4 evo from Amazon.com jus a few days ago I have gone to every site on it and played it... this game just rocks you have my favorite the Dodge truck. then you have Chevy,Gmc,Ford,Toyota,Nissan,Mitsubushi and then other trucks related to that company. There is 70 trucks in all and 16 courses packed with fun stuff to do. The tracks are truly graphical and they all have certain charecteristics. From snow to mud and ice you have a sweet track. From snow covered mountains to a bright sunny day is what you will encounter a fun packed game."
2,Mediocre at best,"I don't understand why this game is rated so high. The animation is slow and choppy and there is no feeling of speed. Also, you can floor it and still take turns at 60 mph without letting off the gas. Not very realistic handling or physics at all. Also, compared to most other Dreamcast racers, the graphics are drab and flat and certainly are not Dreamcast quality.Rent it before you buy."
2,Disappointing,"Hey, is it just my eyes, or do PC-to-DC ported games always have sub-par graphics? Grainy textures, low polygon count, slowdowns, and overall bad framerates.But wait... if the game itself is good, these flaws can be forgiven, right? Sure, that was the case with Soldier of Fortune. It is NOT the case with 4X4 Evolution, because this game is not really much fun. Go get Daytona USA instead!"
2,Try Again,"I have been a long time fan of racing games, from Rad Racer all the way to Tokyo Extreme Racer 2. Never have I been so dissappointed with a game so quickly. I was very excited to see that a game was finally available that races the big trucks instead of the exotics. The only other time I remember this being done before was Ivan Stewart's Off Road. However when I think racer, I think speed. A characteristic this game lacks severely. Even when driving along at 100mph+, your truck still seems to just be creeping along your screen. The handling is sub-standard in comparison to most racing games and the only saving grace I could find in this game was the graphics. All of the vehicles are rendered exactly like their counterparts and the instant replay is incredible. This isn't quite enough to save this game and I suggest if you are looking for a High quality off road racer be patient and save your money because this isn't it."
1,Don't buy it,"I was expecting to see the 1964 World's Fair, instead I heard only people talking about the World's Fair. You only see the outside of the Buildings. If you like to hear people TALK about the World's fair and see home movies of people talking about the World's fair then by all means buy it but if you are expecting to see the rides , etc. don't waste your money. We were very disappointed."
3,SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE ROBERT MOSES ARE NECESSARY,"As a documentary recording of the Fair I found it useful and would be to anyone researching expo's, world's fairs or expositions of one sort or another.It did give me a better appreciation of just how difficult it can be to mount these sorts of expressions particularly when you are snubbing your nose at the ""official"" international organising body of such events. Us humans can and do tend to get caught up in habit which can equate with boring. Hey occasional we need to take a different path to break away from the beaten track. Otherwise it all just becomes predictable rehash. Can understand why they chose a steam roller like Robert Moses to bulldoze it through.As an entertainment the DVD in itself was pretty so so!"
2,Mildly interesting,Really kind of of boring. Much more about the building as opposed to the attractions I remember so fondly.
5,Amazing glow especially at night,Love this globe. Looks great all day and at night the light coming from the globe is really bright and lovelyl
5,The Great 'English' Passion,"Conductor-Composer Benjamin Britten and Imogen Holst took 15 years to mold this Bach Passion into a piece of reverence in Baroque music with an accurate and sublime English text. Britten as the conductor in this 1971 recording summons the brilliance of his cast, the Wandsworth Boy Choir, and the English Chamber Orchestra. This English version without a doubt rivals any of the German versions recorded with its regard for the technicality and grandeur of St. John's Passion."
3,This is not a great recording.,"I must disagree with my fellow reviewers. Although I find Britten's general direction quite excellent, there are a few recording issues that interfere with the music. At points, the balance and the dynamics are erratic, which may simply be the fault of the technical engineers rather than the performers. Although the solo sections can be sublime, the choral sections suffer sloppy cutoffs and often incomprehensible diction."
5,Lenox Nativity,The set is absolutely beautiful--every bit as perfect as I had hoped it would be! I want to get the three wise men next.
3,checks the review dates,"Just check the dates on which the 5 star reviews were written.3 on Jan 11, 2 on Jan 12, 2 on Jan 13... All 5 stars.. A bit too good to be true"
5,Delightful first novel!,"I thoroughly enjoyed E. Scott Tapscott's delightful first novel. She did an excellent job on her characterizations, and the plot provided many surprising twists and turns. It was refreshing to read a book that didn't have to rely on vulgarities in every paragraph. I am hoping to read more of her work. Thank you. Sharon"
3,Holiday Suspense,"He Sees You When You're Sleeping is a light holiday suspense about a man, Sterling who is in heaven's waiting room and his journey to gain his entrance in. Sterling is sent to young Marissa to help her out in a sticky situation involving her family and the mob. Marissa's father and grandmother are sheltered in the witness protection program and Marissa cannot bear Christmas without them. This story is not meant to be heavy by any means. The plot could have definitely been developed more."
3,Just an average story by a couple of great writers,"He Sees You When You're Sleeping by Mary Higgins Clark and Mary Higgins Clark in my opinion was just an average story by a couple of great writers.The thought of angels returning to earth to set things right for some in itself was a chilling thought to me contrary to what a lot of people may believe in in this realm. I certainly do not. That part of the story did not set well with me.But even so there were things in this story that I did enjoy. I believe the over-all plot or intended message of the story or the outcome of such is simply that of ""redemption""."
4,He Sees You When Your Sleeping,"I think this is a great book for all types of people. Sterling, the main character , had unforgetable encouters and helped the lives of several people. This book made me think of how life would be like after death and how good you should be to others. This story took place near Christmas. I would recomend reading it towards the end of the year. I recommend this book to everyone."
2,Not her best work!,"I have read most of Mary Higgins Clark books and have always enjoyed them. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to her reputation. I found the book to be very predictable and didn't feel her characters had a lot of depth to them. I was very disappointed. I think she should really stick to what she knows and does best and that's writing mysteries."
3,He's sees you when you're writing!,"Although I believe that Mary Higgins Clark is the best novelist of our times, this book was NOT one of her best. I personally was not intrigued by angels floating back to earth to set things right. Although there are touching moments in the book...I did not feel any suspense or sense of doom for any of the characters. You knew what was coming next! Definitely a book you can avoid this or any holiday season. Better Luck next time, Mary!"
2,Major disappointment,I have been an avid fan of Mary Higgins Clark for years and have every one of her books. I received this book as a gift and it was obvious that Mary Higgins allowed her daughter to do most of the writing. The book was boring and Carol Higgins is not much of a writer and only sells books because she trades on her mother's name. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
1,He Sees You When You're Sleeping,"This book is childish and does not merit having Mary Higgins Clark's name on it. It's NOT her style, but that of her daughter's . . . Carol Higgins Clark, who has written several VERY boring books. It's very apparent that mother is trying to boost daughter's ratings with the merits of her own wonderful works. Buy it used if you feel you have to read it, but you'll be ticked at yourself for paying full price! Inheritance is wonderful, but Carol obviously doesn't have it in her genes to follow her mother's writing. She should pray for a cash settlement and give up the writing."
3,Not As Good As I Expected,"While Sterling Brooks was on Earth he was self-absorbed. He cared about nothing but himself, and kept people hanging. Such as Annie, the woman he proposed to, but never married. Now up in Heaven he's paying for it. He's been in the Celestial Waiting Room for over 40 years, and has still yet to redeem himself. Until the Heavenly Council tell him to make good for the holidays with someone on Earth.For Sterling, it's Marissa. A little girl who's father and grandmother were put into the Witness Protection program due to overhearing a conversation between mobsters. A threat actually. Since then, Marissa has lost all her Christmas spirit, and is always unhappy. It's now up to Sterling to reunite Marissa with her father and grandmother before she gives up hope altogether.While this was a well written book, I found it choppy and not at the Higgins' best."
3,ok,He sees You When Your Sleeping is about Sterling who is not allowed to enter heaven. So he gets sent to earth to help Marissa get her father and grandmother back. They are in the witness protection program for knowing too much about a pair of brothers. A little predictable but not too bad. It is a little like the movie It's A Wonderful Life only not as good.
4,Christmas Fantasy Thriller,"Want an easy read Christmas fantasy? This is it. I always appreciate the co-writing of mom and daughter Higgins Clark and this is another winner. Their writings seem to complement each other and keep your attention. In this novel the hero (?) is being kept waiting by the powers-that-be in a pre-heaven waiting room. He is not wisked right in because of his poor and selfish treatment of others during his life on earth. But now, he is being given a chance to redeem himself by helping someone back on earth. He is not told ""who"" or ""what"", and is then dropped off at a Times Square ice rink to do a ""good deed."" You may be reminded of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but the Clark's filled the story out with suspense and danger. It a great read."
1,Very Disappointing,"I should have stuck to what I said last year about not purchasing any of these little Christmas book by MHC and CHC.I had to force myself to read 30 or so pages. I am a HUGE Mary Higgins Clark fan, but I am staying away from her holiday books. They are poorly written, and boring.I read the other reviews before I purchased this book, but I should have gone with my gut instinct on this one.Also, it didn't help that right off the bat, Tara Lipinski's name was spelled incorrectly. You would think that someone would have caught that."
2,"Great Start, but turns predictable...","The basis for this novel is excellent. I had high hopes as Clark hooked me at the beginning with the plot. However, throughout the book I would tell my husband, ""I bet xyz is going to happen next."" And sure enough it would."
4,Should Be Titled It's A Dangerous Life! Super Read!!!,"What super read! I had trouble putting this one down!!! The title should be compared to the Christmas movie, It's A Wonderful LIfe but with an added twist, 'Danger...' This story will get your blood a pumpin' and your heart a thumpin'. In my opinion--a must read!"
2,Not Like Mary Higgins Clark,"I read every single one of Mary Higgins Clark's hardcover books and none is like this. This book did not contain the trademark suspense thrilling storyline that I have come to love about Ms. Clark's writings. I just finished the book because I am an avid Mary Higgins Clark fan. But this book, unfortunately, was a big disappointment. However, I will continue reading anything this spectacular author produces."
2,Simplistic,"I hate to knock a book about Christmas, and angels and all that good stuff, but this is just too childish. Actually it would be good for my twelve year old grand-daughter so all may not be lost. This is the second loser by mom/daughter that I have read and I wish they would give it up. Even the last Mary H C I read was trite and poor and not worth the time. Sorry this just is not a good read, period."
3,"Funny, touching movie about faith and family colliding.","""Nora's Will"" is a funny, touching movie about faith and family colliding. More effective for not escalating to farce and/or hysterics as an American version of the story might have."
5,a classic,"I bought this when it was first released, and it has been a constant favorite that does not grow old."
5,a family favorite,"I love the music on this CD--it calms me and makes my heart sing. My kids used to listen to it every night as they went to sleep, so it has sweet memories for our whole family."
1,Why any other book would be a better choice,"I read some of the reviews and was shocked to see others giving this book a anything higher then one star. It started off in a boring setting, nothing was going on, it lead to no where. Some parts were confusing and made it a struggle to get through. I think you'd have more fun going to a movie or reading another book, anything but this one."
5,a compelling view of China's recent past,"This novel is recommended for anyone interested in China's recent past. Though the storyline is different, it has the same poignancy of Joan Chen's film Xiu Xiu the Sent-Down Girl. Lili is caught in the turmoil of China in the 1980s-- still reeling from the impact of the Cultural Revolution, and still undergoing the ""growing pains"" of transformation from a communist to free market society. Lili, the title character, is shorn of hope, someone who is utterly rejected by her society. Yet, somehow, she survives and manages to find new meaning in life. Lili is told from an insider's point of view-that is, someone who is intimately acquainted with Chinese society and culture. It is a window to an eastern culture that is at once fascinating and compelling. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in China or Asia"
1,not accurate,"i had problem reading book because of language. however, what i understand is that the story is like to many other books i have read. i was recommended this book by colleague since i am learning english. i lived during that time and the book did not seem to reflect that. it was not something that should be made fictional i think. it makes me upset to read about a painful time but not written the way it happened. i have heard many good things about author but i do not think i will read other chinese books by her."
1,Extremely Hard To Read,"I have always enjoyed reading books and have a very hard time finding one that I don't like. However, this book was horrible. It was really hard to follow what was going on in the story. I had to keep backtracking to figure out who was who. The dialect was very weird its almost as if the author is trying too hard. She is slanting the information and keeping not only the characters clueless to whats going on but to the readers as well. I wish I could take the time back that I spent reading this book and spent it on something worthwhile like rereading The Samurai's Garden."
4,Think your life's tough?,"Think your life's tough? Just look at what Lili has to deal with. Growing up in communist China, she spends all of her teen years living in a work camp--where everything is shared, and there is no privacy. Also, kids are offered rewards for ratting on their parents. She eventually runs away to live on the streets of Beijing. But it's not until she meets an American reporter that she questions herself and some of the customs of her country. Lili is both obnoxious and funny, and it's easy to have mixed feelings about her. Just when the reading starts to feel too much like an assignment your English teacher would have given you, Annie Wang writes something that truly makes you appreciate how good you've got it."
1,Uninspired,"The story of a girl turning to someone outside of her own culture for redemption is typical and overdone. Focusing on this tale and portraying it as the norm among an entire generation of Chinese people is not only inaccurate, it is insulting.The main character of Lili seems to lack perspective on everything but herself. Add to that the storytelling style and vocabulary makes Lili a difficult read."
1,Not saying much,"As far as this books go, it doesnt seem to say much to me that shows me anything that other books wont say better. The story and character never seem to catch interest or potrait the situation in a way that goes through to me.Not much seems to catch interest or set a mood for making this book a thoughtfull gift to people who might know the situation. All in all, a story that has been told by others and no doubt with better result."
1,Not too appealing to me,"I think it's because of my tastes where I didn't seem to enjoy this book as much as I would have hoped. I know it's fiction, but some images that were portrayed seem unreal and unbelievable. Lili's character was too self centered, and didn't seem like a character I could relate to. The writing style was okay, considering it is the author's second language.The story was just too stereotypical and lacked the creativity that I was looking for."
1,This movie spelled the end for the blair witch franchise,"As I sat through this movie, I wondered: WHAT were they thinking? The first movie was so original and so creepy, yet the second movie resorted to using tired old stereotypical characters - the goth chick, the crazy guy, the misunderstood wiccan - and none of those characters came across in a realistic way. The characters in this movie were so one-dimensional that it was painful to watch. It was almost as if they wanted to release SOMETHING, as fast as they could, in order to capitalize on the success of the first movie, that they didn't care about the quality of their work."
1,the winner for worst sequel ever!!!,"and in top 10 worst movies of all time!!! you will not find this director doing anything outside of the commercial realm anytime soon after this mess.and i doubt any of the actors will survive this.only the grips may walk away unscathed.i could spend a glorious lifetime detailing how awefull this was.it made part 1 seem like citizen kane!!! but i wont do that.instead ill just try and warn those who might buy this to think again.spend that money on 50 pounds of discarded banana peels,pidgeon feathers,getting drunk,or even hold up that $20 and burn it.anything but using it to buy this junk will make you a happier consumer."
1,DESERVES NO STARS,"THIS IS A TERRIBLE MOVIE. THE ACTING IS BAD, THE SCRIPT IS BAD, THE ART DIRECTION IS BAD. THE DVD, IN KEEPING WITH THE MOVIE, ALSO PLAYS JUST AWFULLY--I AM GLAD I RENTED IT AND DID NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE. THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 1ST AND HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH A BOOK OF SHADOWS. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE DOING A LIST OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER EVER EVER."
1,A Sequel That Should Not Have Been,"This ""sequel"" to the Blair Witch project should not have been made.The movie had absolutely NOTHING to do with the advertisement for it, it was as if the advertisements had been talking about an entirely different movie.There was talk of a third Blair Witch movie in the works, but nothing came of it.After viewing this bomb, you will know why."
5,A study of madness,"Did I see the same movie as everyone who so casually trashes Blair Witch 2? Okay, so it began a little erraticand strange, but once it got going, I was glued to the TV. I found it suspenseful and dramatic. To me, it wasa study in human madness; how a group of people can experience something together so markedly weird that theyslowly descend into insanity.I wasn't a huge fan of the original Blair Witch. I didn't find it as scary as everyone else. I found it to bevery...anticlimactic. They kept trying to build up suspense over and over, but very little actually happened! Iwas actually bored by Blair Witch by the very end.Not so with part two. I found it eerie and unsettling, and when the truth of what actually happened came out inthe end, I was blown away.Maybe I'm a minority of one, but I recommend B.W. 2 wholeheartedly."
3,Ok.........,"The first blair witch project was ok i guess. It wasnt terribly scary, i only watched it once. I saw bits and pieces of the second one on tv. They were both kind of the same from what i saw. if you like one of them then buy it. Its a good price for both of them. Can someone tell me why they have that double deal where you can buy this and then the first one for 30 bucks? i dont get it..."
5,Very Useful for the met scientist,"For the developer, researcher, I would like to use this book like bible. Very useful and easy for understanding. Hope to recommend this book for Met Scientist..."
4,Very pleased.,"This game is excellent. Almost every aspect of the game is enjoyable. The controls are easy to learn. The ""quests"" start of easy and become harder as you progress. The AI is outstanding. I've only had a few problems with this game:1. Ocassionally it quits unexpectedly2. I've found that sometimes certain quests can not be completed and or quests conflict with each other.3. The story line is kinda hard to followOther than that everything else is great."
2,Disappointing - the better choice is to wait for Gothic 3,"the first days i played the game, i had a bit fun because of the possibilities and the complex environment.after a while i noticed the bad leveldesign and the sterile, unemotional non player characters...most of the dungeons,caves and so on look like made out of a level construction kit! the auto-balancing feature is a matter of taste,but i didn?t like it.all in all a very complexe classic rpg without real depth and partially boring quests.i really missed the originally charakter- and leveldesign of the Gothic series!"
3,It is boring,First 30 minutes it is fun but then it gets very very boring. Quests are fun but stupid item leveling kills any passion for exploration. What sense does it make to search 21st dungeon if it does not differ from 20th and items you get depend ONLY on your level?It is not a super-cool-worth-buying-xbox-for-it game if I get bored after an hour of playing.
1,Video Issues,"I am an enthusiastic player of the previous Elder Scrolls games. I was looking forward to the latest offering. As soon as it arrived I attempted to install it on my Dell Inspiron 8500 only to discover that it would not run. The video was all fuzzy white with no texture definition. I was surprised since Morrowind ran fine.Apparently the game developers decided to require an upgrade of video cards to fairly recent models. Since my Dell is a 3 yearaold laptop, this is not easily done. Perhaps game developers should consider that a forced boost to the hardware manufacturer's bottom line by buying a new computer to run their game is very annoying. It also crashed a lot. Potential buyers beware."
2,Doesn't touch WOW or Guild Wars,"If you have never played WOW or Guild Wars, this game may be pretty good. However, just coming off of Guild Wars, Oblivion cannot even compare. The interface is much better as well as the game play itself. If you really like Oblivion, try Guild Wars (no monthly fee) or World of Warcraft (monthly fee). You will never even think about Elder Scrolls again."
1,This Game Needs Work,"I received this game on Friday the 24th of March. My computer was running Intel extreme 3D onboard chipset. I changed the graphics out to a GeFORCE FX5500 PCI graphics card W/ 256mb DDR and its own proccessor. This game turned out to be unplayable, I couldn't even develope a character. The opening sequence, the audio was broken and the video was jerky. At another place, there were video artifacts. The graphics are kick ass fantastic, its just too bad that this game was rushed to market before it was completed. Hopefully the Xbox version is better. Oh yeah, my pc is running a 2.53 ghz proccessor. Oh well, I still have alot to do in Morrowind."
1,$50 if you want to spend an extra $200,Just got a new computer on 12/28/05 has that stupid intell graphics card which this game won't support due to the lighting and shading. No way am I shelling out an extra $200 ripping up my computer just to play this game. Bethesda should be a shamed of itself foer ripping people off like this.
3,Very good if you have the PC power for all the features,"I played Oblivion for a few weeks, spending much of the time tweaking the settings, testing player created mods, trying to find a way to get the most fun out of it.In the end what was taking away from my enjoyment was not the game design, it was that my mid-range PC simply could not support all the graphic features that make Oblivion such an immersive experience. One by one I was turning down (or turning off) the graphic options to try and maintain a decent framerate. Without a good framerate combat can be a misery and eventually I just had to sacrifice too much.If you have a powerful system both in CPU and graphics you will get the most out of this game. If you have to sacrifice the visuals just to play it will hamstring your fun."
2,It has some serious issues,"Bugs. I can play about 10 minutes before it crashes and burns. I'm a software engineer, I know my way around systems, hardware, software, etc, and my system is well within the specs they demand. But it bombs, and it bombs a lot. I'm running 9 other high end games on my system, and none of them have problems, so I have to assume it is Oblivion bugs.The AI is WAY over hyped. The graphics are good. The sounds is so-so. The interface is certainly not what it could be. I'm astounded people are giving this thing nearly perfect reviews. A good game, yes, (if it's not crashing), but absolute perfection....give me a break."
4,Massive world,"This game was very fun to play. The world-map is massive and there is a seemingly endless number of quests to complete. After a while, however, I found the quests began feeling too redundant. I haven't had a chance to test out the map editor, but I have heard good things about it."
2,Very Over-Hyped,"If you played and enjoyed the outstanding ES3 Morrowind then do not get too excited about this game.Granted the graphics are outstanding to a point ... your view ""distance"" is very short to maintain graphics quality hence you see things popping in front of you very close.All loot and creatures are leveled to your level so you can beat everything in the game and you wont get any cool loot for doing so. Essentially there is no suspense that if you go through door 'A' that you may get beat very badly. It does not matter - just charge ahead, if you are level 8 then the creatures will be level 8 - No challenge at all.The wilderness is empty, I have cut across country as a level 4 and saw a total of 6 creatures in 45 minutes of random deep wilderness travel. (2 rats and 4 wolves)Overall the game is ok but will not hold your attention very long, it is way to easy and obviously designed for those with short attention spans and needless simplicity."
2,What is the point?,"The main story line is too short and too easy, there are lots of subplots and other places to go, but no reason to do them. You don't need to gain experience to finish the game. It just isn't tied together well. Here is a bag of quest you can do, or not. Here are a bunch of places you can go, or not. Linear games are no fun, but this game is no fun either, games should offer alternate paths and lots of side quests, but they should be useful or some how tied to the plot. The gameplay is fairly week too, it is like fighting on an old console adventure game. Somebody please buy Fallout III from Bethesda before they screw it up."
1,A very well thought scheme,"The Minimum Specifications of this game are a joke. I exceed all ""minimum specifications"" yet this game is so laggy on my computer on low graphics I have requested my money back. I am sure this is a very fun game, but if you buy it, you better own the most up to date computer as possible."
5,Blows other RPG's out of the water,"I've been spoiled by ES:Oblivion. No other game will satisfy me now graphics wise and story-wise.Want a game where the graphics are so realistic that you can feel the gravel under your feet while your character takes a detour off the main road to check out some unexplored cavern, guaranteed to be eerie and occupied by unsavory creatures?How about stunning architecture that's different in style in every major city?How about different scenery, fauna, flora and climates for each city depending on which region? Different concentration of races in each city?Realistic horseback riding?NPC's that you cannot help becoming endeared to?4 different major factions to join ranging from the heights of chivalry to cold blooded?I can go on and on.This is the RPG of all RPG. It ends here. Get this game NOW."
1,Horrible game.,"Beautiful graphics and nice storyline, but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful! Not to mention, the monsters level up with you so you'll never be at an advantage. You could pretty much beat the game at level 5 !"
3,Life sucks.,"Life sucks when you are a sword swinging, spell slinging, bow using, elf, orc, human with no where to go and nothing to do. Exploring just eventually gets boring. Side quests... what side quests? Two dozen maybe? For a game so big better character variation, larger side quests and more involved combat would have made this an amazing achievment. This game falls short in every category that Neverwinter 2 over achieves in."
2,"Good game, bad merchant","I bought the Elder Scrolls Oblivion for my pc a few days ago with standard shipping. I expected the game to come within 3-5 business day the way standard shipping works. I was very disappointed when I discovered that the delivery date had been bumped from the 17th to the 22nd. The shipping is very slow and you can go to your local game store and buy the game for the same price, if not less for the game and the shipping via Amazon."
5,Big,Played for over 140 hours and still HaVen'T FINISHED the Main Quest!It's so awesome! I'm so Evil!
2,Not much fun,I played for a few weeks and it never got interesting or fun. I was dragging myself through it because other people said it was so great. The caves were repetitive and easy to get lost in. The save states were pretty horrid. You never knew if what you were doing will get your in trouble with the guards. You gain skill so slowly that I didn't feel any better off the last day than the first day.
2,Get the 360 version,Had been looking forward to this one for a long time. Installed fine on a very nice and fast PC about a year old. Very good graphics card and 2 GB RAM. Graphics seemed pretty decent and good framerate. BUT -- after saving my game I could never play it again as my character was stuck floating continually. Even tried uninstalling and reinstalling it. Deleting the gamefiles... everything.Still didn't work. So that made me finally get an Xbox 360 and I haven't regretted it. The graphics are way better (in HD) and the gameplay is better with the controller.While $399 may seem a large price to pay for one game -- consider that JUST a new top of the line graphics card would run you well over $500.Great game. Full of bugs for me.
1,"BUGS,BUGS EVERY WHERE BUGS","I have a VOODOO top of the line line rig so the problems are not with the PC.IT is in the game.Freezes up,Black screen,blue screen,yellow screen,When turning half the screen goes blank sometimes.Not worth the price or effort.It got to the point that my pc would shut down on the blue screen of death.( The pc closed down to prevent damage )Near the end of the game it just quit loading. The loading bar would freeze about half way so I never got to finish the game.BEWARE THIS GAME COULD DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER!!!!!!"
2,Wait for patch,"My advice is to wait for a patch. This game looks and plays great. But catastrophically buggy is the best way I would put it. As in, put 40 or even 80 hours of gameplay in and then lose your save game or maybe just have it go corrupt enough that you can no longer do some of the quests you were working on. And on top of that, get no help after submitting issues to tech support. All this assuming you can even play the game on a system more than a year old without spending time tweaking files.Fantastic game, incredibly poorly delivered."
2,Has potential but falls short.,"While reading Operation Titan, I kept thinking of Star Wars. There were some similarities and that comparison only made this book fall short of the higher standard. In addition, I felt I began the story in the middle of a larger story. I kept wondering about the background and depth of the characters before the setting of the book. However, as a Christian I appreciated the references to Jesus Christ."
5,"BROOKLYN BABYLON, IS GREAT! TARIQ TROTTER IS FINE! AND SEXY!","THE MOVIE WAS HEART WARMING, AND PROVES, LOVE IS LOVE, AND IT HAS NO COLOR! GOD IS LOVE! LOVE SOMEONE! PEACE!"
5,Enlightening,"Although I love to read and am a librarian by profession, this is the first book that I have felt compelled to review because it is so important. I always had difficulty reconciling the God of the Old Testament with that of the New Testament. The Old Testament god is always angry and helping the Israelites defeat their enemies in battle or telling them they must sacrifice their children. He is angry, jealous, and frightening. Three of the world's major religions are based on this god. Given the state of the world today, that is very frightening. Jehovah Unmasked is easy to read and very thoughtful with plenty of quotes from the Bible to prove the author's point. Read this book with an open mind and think about it carefully. I dare you."
5,YO! Nathaniel! I read your book!,"Okay, I finally read it. You were right and I was wrong. I had a lot of fun finding out that ""God"" was the one who lied through his teeth to Adam and Eve. The stuff on God the Mother tripped me out too. I still can't stand the Bible but at least it makes sense now."
1,Avoid this book,"This is an awful extremely biased angry and bitterful book. Filled with blasphemy and the twisting of the word of God, to degrade the Christian organized church. It is true that much of the history of organized religion is awful and continues to be awful, so why waste our time and badger the reader so with it? This book serves no purpose other than for the author to vent and spew vile theories.The author presents his conclusions in a raw and unpretentious way that I can appreciate, but it's not enough to make the experience worthwhile. This is certainly not an uplifting read in any manner. The spirit of this book is altogether wrong."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book based on the rave reviews posted in Amazon. If you are looking for a scholarly, unbiased book on the origins of Jehovah, this isn't it. Most of the ""great revelations"" are well known and are discussed in many scholarly works, popular literature, and even textbooks."
3,Cooking made Simple,"Bill's cooking book is very simply written and it doesn't contain any difficult language used sometimes by famous chef. The one disapointing thing is that the book is mostly seafood and if you are not a fan you just bought the book that might not offer much to you. Overall, great book to learn from."
5,Fabulous,"Bill's recipes have simple instructions & require few ingredients. Minimal fuss & great results! We use a little less butter than Bill' recipes ask for, however the food turns out just as well. For the (rare) special ingredients required, try your local whole foods or speciality gorcer. It's not difficult to source it. Better still substitute it with some thing equivalent. My favourite recipes are the banana bread with chocolate chips & breakfast scones."
4,Great recipes,"Heaps of great recipes, really easy to follow and not needing too many ingredients that you wouldn't ordinarily have in the cupboard. Will buy another Bill Granger book!"
5,"The Best ""Time Travel Book"" I Ever Read","I have read alot of Time Travel books and this the BEST one I've every read! You can read the snyopsis of the book elsewhere, I won't bore you with repeating it. It's almost like Time Travel is an ""aside"" to the wonderful plot Banchi builds and the fabulous characters she creates. Banchi covers two different time periods and controversial racial subject matter, with style and great care. Banchi's people are memorable and so very human. I had tears in my eyes when I finished the book.Get this and read it as soon as you can."
5,I love Time Travel Books!,"I love Time Travel books and so I was intrigued when I saw this one available. When I first started reading it, I thought it might be kind of hokey, but as I continued, I got so into it, I could not put it down. It was great. The relationship between the two lead characters is so honest, so believeable, I really felt as if I knew them myself.My other favorite Time Travel books are Replay, The Mirror, Time Traveler's Wife and 2150 AD, though some of these are not considered Time Travel books, they are real grabbers!"
3,Great Phone,"This model of the LG phones is a great model. It is small and compact and can easily fit in a pocket, for men, or a small purse, for women. I have always had great service with this phone. A few problems are that it tends to generate quite a bit of heat when on the phone for an extended period of time. Try to avoid any contact with water what so ever, even down the tears, because it will cause severe battery damage. Another complaint is that there is no outside screen present, so in order to see who is calling it is necessary to open phone. This is a very simple phone, which only has the ability to make phone calls and send text messages. It is ideal for a person who does not desire all the new rage technology such as camera phones and videophones."
3,Difficult beginning,"Amazon is one of the most trustable internet shop and Verizon is one of the most trustable vireless service provider. That is why I choose this. However, the beginning is really painful to me. It wasted me more than two hours to make more than 3 pnone calls to Verizon and 2 phone calls to Amazon to make my phone work. Maybe there are some problems for the communication between them. I do not know. But I just want the phone I bought work. It seems not easy. Therefore, if you would like to choose this a little complex method, prepare to pay your time. In fact,my friend also bought a phone, but it works well. Anyway, I get it work now."
3,Daddy's Little Helper,"ISBN 0859532747 - I'm a huge fan of board books, and of little kids, and even of men cleaning the house. But this book just didn't cut it for me, to my surprise, maybe because there is no text.In cute images, a little boy and his father clean the house together.The images are nice, although nothing spectacular. The text, there is none. Endersby gets a nod for telling the story, such as it is, without a single word of text. Overall, the book's just average.- AnnaLovesBooks"
1,Tastes terrible,"I have been using Emergen-C products for many years and they are great. I take MSM for years also and thought I would try this product. I don't like this product. I take multiple grams of MSM and can only take 1000 mg of MSM because my normal dose of MSM is 4000 to 6000 mg/day and I would overdose on Vitamin C. So even if the taste was palatable, it wouldn't do the job. I will never purchase this product again and will not take what I have already bought."
4,Arrived Broken,"I really like these, the arrived exactly as I thought they would. Unfortunately on one of the two bookends, the man was detached and separated from the base. The glue that was meant to hold him on was no longer doing so.I've since then glued them together with my own epoxy, but kind of a bummer. Otherwise, exactly what I expected."
4,Pretty nice,"Not bad - they are nice and heavy and wont move for even your biggest books. They are pretty wide, so if you don't have a lot of shelf space, you might want to look for something a little less wide. But for the price, these are a really nice value and look pretty good. I recommend them."
1,What a waste of time,I read most of Dale Brown's books. They generally are OK; he is certainly not my favorite author but usually writes a decent military adventure novel. This one is just pathetic. I'd hope that he would do a better job tackling the timely issue of illegal immigration. The characters are lame and very poorly written. The talk show host especially is what the Obama administration wishes talk radio hosts were like-stupid and ignorant. Most of the military folks and even the terrorists aren't a whole lot better. Save your time and money and re-read a Tom Clancy novel instead.
1,World's Worst Reader,"Edge of Battle CD: A NovelThis was my seventh Dale Brown audiobook, and in all fairness to the author, my single star rating has nothing to do with the book content. In fact, I never completed even one CD. Anyone listening to this book through a headset will go nuts adjusting the volume control to keep up with the constant changing in voice level from screaming loud commands in Spanish to a low whisper.Dale, next time don't let your hard work crash on takeoff because of a poor reader like Michael McShane, or at least spend a little money editing the audio volume."
2,The old Dale Brown is gone...,"Once upon a time, Dale Brown was one of my favorite authors. OLD DOG was a great, and HAMMERHEADS is one of my all-time favorites. That Dale Brown is gone. The stories that appear instead are campy, overly dramatic, and highly unbelievable. On top of that, character development has all be disappeared. This novel does a poor job of using established TALON characters in a scenario involving immigration issues and a potential war with Mexico. Overworked, overdramatic, overdone. Just plain ""over."""
1,"I'm over the age of 13, but...","...if YOU are, you might want to skip this book. I love military techno-thrillers, but this isn't one. The dialogue belongs in a comic book, the characters are poorly developed, and while I don't mind a meaningful sex scene that lends something to the story, the ones in this book are sophomoric and gratuitous. Dale brown had a few good books in him, but that was yesteryear. What's that old saying about a bunch of monkeys pounding on a typewriter?For a better novel of war with Mexico, read Harold Coyle's TRIAL BY FIRE."
1,Awful. Just bloody awful.,"I have been an admirer of Dale Brown's early work and was stunned when I picked up ""Act of War"" a couple of years ago to find it a work perhaps written by a third grader. The ideas were stupid. The characters largely dispicable and the plot silly to point of absurdity.When I found Edge of Battle on the shelves at my local library I thought, ""Everyone is entitled to a bad day!"" and picked it up. Worst mistake of 2006. The people running the United States government and military in this book are morons, without redeeming social worth and should be banned from ever appearing in print again. The story is even stupider than ""Act of War"" and frankly I was hoping someone would nuke me and put me out of my misery.I turned the book back into the library unfinished and unlamented. I hereby resolve to never read a Dale Brown book again."
1,Over the Edge,"I couldn't finish the book, it was so bad. Cardboard cut-out characters, no-way-baby plot(?) and dialogue, it is far from Brown's better work. Makes me wonder if someone else wrote this for Dale Brown."
1,Edge of Boredom,"I bought this at the airport and the first 150 pages or so are quite entertaining, but it gets progressively repetitive and convoluted with each passing chapter. I'm struggling to finish it. The characters are bad stereotypes, the dialog is often silly, and the sub-plots are just unbelievable. It's also way too long--where's the editor? It's my first Dale Brown and I can believe his earlier work is probably much better. At some point, I think these big authors go on auto-pilot, who knows, but avoid it."
2,Toooo Long with toooo much dialog and little action,"Just finished listening to the Unabridged Audio book Edge of Battle by Dale Brown. Generally, I like Dale Brown's works, but, this book was simply too long with tooooooo little action. Many many long long long dialogs (a radio DJ making speeches) that hammer the same point over and over.Very little action, lots of talking. This would have been much better if it had been abridged from the current 12 CDs down to about 4 CDs. Obviously, not one of my favorite books."
1,Why do people keep publishing his books?,"My god this is a terrible book. I have to wonder if the publisher is bound by a contract to keep publishing Dale Brown's books, because I can't see how anyone could possibly like them. Ridiculous characters, fantasy-like weapons, and just a stupid, stupid plot."
1,Unreadable,"I couldn't get beyond the first chapter, where the unbelievably bad Spanish left me incredulous."
4,Techno Babble,The book was typical of Dale Brown's work. The story line is good and the reading easy except for all the technical jargan.
2,This Book Stinks,"This story stinks, I thought it was lacked a decent storyline and was generally poorly written based upon his previous books. I wonder if this book written to satisfy a contract or just to make money. Mr. Brown should go read one of Mr. W.E.B. Griffin's books to remind him what a well written thriller story looks like. Purchasing his book was a waste of my $25.95 plus tax. Hope Mr. Brown does better in the future."
5,A killer book,Amps up the war on terror...adds some much needed body count on the good guys side. This is one I ripped straight through.
4,weed identification,"Worried about buying used, but received in condition as advertised. Recommended for school, but will also be a great book to take into the field."
4,A Link to history!,"Robert Gordon had the haircut, the attitude, the sensibility of emerging mid/late 70's punk. Xcept he sang as if interpreting the Rosetta Stone of Rock and Roll. He sang Sun records, Rockabilly, Country, like he lived loved it. Purists sniffed and said, ""Oh just a pretender"" Even with legendary guitarist Link Wray at the helm!The truth is that Robert had a better, more evocative voice than the classic rockabilly/R n R, Soul,artists that he had covered. Listen to ""Red Hot"", compare..Robert Gordon is a treasure and listening to this CD is like riding top down a red Cadillac wearing black slacks a gum snappin' girl on the bench seat and a middle finger to the world grinnin' all the way"
2,Meh,"Of course, the rapturous (and LOUD) applause at various portions of the recording obviously indicate I don't know what I'm talking about. Folks, feel free to mark my review Unhelpful, but I'm handing this one off on my in-law and will look to other Tutte offerings (after I give it an extended hiatus for my ears to recover)."
5,WONDERFUL,You must hear this set even if you have other versions. It is a collector's set and a top 2 choice for any buyer of Cosi. The other top choice is the Bohm set
4,"""Great Poster Of Stallone Classic!""",Rocky is definitely one of Stallone's best and I love allthe films. I knew I had to get a poster and glad I boughtthis one. It's great and I recommend it to anyone who isa Rocky fan.
2,Disappointing but I bet you read it anyway.,This book has perverted stream of consiousness writing to rival even the best of the Gor series with the character development of a VC Andrews novel and a Rosemary's Baby vibe.
3,Good book - hohum DVD,"I have to believe that CBS News could come up with a better DVD on the events of 9/11 than this one. I was hoping to see the CBS live coverage of the tragedy but was greatly disappointed. Outside of about 10 minutes of live coverage of the world trade center attacks, the vast majority of the DVD is nothing but segments from 60 Minutes and 48 Hours. Human interest stories are great to fill out this sort of thing but there is far too much of it here. I was astounded to note that CBS apparently had no live coverage of the collapse of either tower. And no mention at all was made of Flight 93 as the events unfold in this program - such coverage only occupying an isolated 5-10 minutes halfway through the DVD. CBS had an opportunity here to give us and future generations a real feel for an historic event as it unfolded ... and they blew it."
4,A great purchase,"This book was brought to my attention at the National Review website. They thought the DVD was great. I agree. I watched the DVD and was amazed how the emotions started to well up in me. I heard the news over the radio on 9/11 so this was the first time that I got to see the ""raw"" newscast as it happened. The only problem that I have is that there is no mention to the flight that went down in Pennsylvania."
1,Dispicable,"I find it dispicable and distasteful that anyone, CBS or CNN makes any profit on the tragedy. I am in NYC and it makes me want to hold CNN in one hand and CBS in the other and knock some sense into them. The slimiest of them all shows their true colors."
2,"Good on basic, but there are better","I bought this because I thought the book would be an excellent visual account of events, but was very disappointed. The black and white photos are grainy and not the high gloss photo of say a TIME magazine. The photos weren't ones that ""capture"" any moment. You know the ones that really stayed in our minds long afterwards - are all missing from this book. It is mostly about how the news crew rememberd the day, how they covered it, how it affected them, and not the events themselves. I would say the CBS covereage of the events were poor and is probably why I watched the events unfold on another statation. I also bought a couple of others for comparison and those are far superior as a documention of the day."
4,Good insight into how the real estate legends did it!,"This is a useful and interesting book for real estate investors. The reader will gain insight about investing in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT's) as well as some practical analysis of how the big players put their deals together. Although the information is not presented as a step by step ""how to manual"", the information can easily be translated into direct investment strategies for the small investor. The author's emphasis on real estate cycles, focus (on property type), leverage and strategy are important and useful concepts for all real estate investors. Overall, a good read for those interested in real property as an investment."
2,Not a real estate investment how to...,"unless you consider some of the ""Maverick Approach's"" such as: Take your time negotiating, Work out the numbers before negotiating, Stay focused on your goals and Be willing to take chances- as advice you could only get from this book. Puh-leez.This book is interesting for the stories of various Big-Time real estate mogul types (outside of The Donald) and some behind the scenes aspects of some of their deals that it covers (Melvin Simon, Eli Broad, Peter and Steven Lowy, Sam Zell, etc. that dont usually get as much coverage as Mr. Trump.) But DO NOT buy this book for specific real estate advice."
1,more like biographies of the rich real estate tycoons,"this book is more like the biographies of the rich real estate tycoons than a real estate investing book. the author has summed up some ""golden"" principles based on these people's experiences, but let me tell you this, there is no single one principle that I could not find in any other real estate book in the market."
5,Maverick Real Estate Investing,"I've been reading Steve Bergsman's real estate columns for years and it's good to see he's finally taken the time to write a book. Probably because he knows the key players in real estate so well, that they took the time to tell him their stories - how each of them made it big in the world of real estate. Thankfully, along with their stories they were able to pass along a few tips to the rest of us. This is a good read with the bonus being we all learn a few things about do's and don'ts of real estate investing"
2,I was very disappointed in this book,"I am into reading Emmett Fox, Catherine Ponder, and Murphy and had read the reviews of this book and bought it. However, I was very disappointed. This author just sounds like he has read a bunch of other positive thinking books and have paraphrased his own book. I think it sounds so fake. I think I could have written this. Not motivating, I couldn't even stay with it."
1,A Copy-Paste of the 1791 Translation of Cowper,"This ""edition"" of the Odyssey is just William Cowper's 1791 English translation, which is open source and can be found for free on many websites.The ""editor"", Tom Thomas (if that is your real name), clearly just copy-pasted the text from the internet, and didn't even bother to format the text to make it readable.So, in conclusion, if you want an archaic English text that is more expensive and harder to read than the free internet version of it, this is the book for you."
1,A mastering nightmare...,"I was very happy to learn that God Lives Underwater was finally releasing their long awaited swan song album ""Up Off The Floor"" Then I received it. Wow. This album has THE worst mastering off any album I know. Like a reviewer said below, the songs sound like they were low bit rate MP3s that were changed to wavs to make this cd. The MP3s I downloaded off of the website a while back sound better. I am very disappointed and I actually thought that the record was a bootleg, but no, Locomotive Records does seem to exist. What a shame."
5,The best god lives underwater so far...,"If you appreciate industrial rock, you'll love this album! I've always been a GLU fan and they've definetly topped their albums with this one. It took a few listens to really appreciate this album. every song on it is good, I can't decide which one is my favorite, they're all unique sounding, there's some poppy choruses in a few songs and some nice sounding synths. These guys are really under rated, I'm surprised that I haven't heard any of these songs on the radio yet. If you like this CD, order the David Reilly's solo acoustic EP (He's got a full length coming early next year, thats the singer. You can find the cd on www.davidreillymusic.com."
3,"Very cute, Very Spikey",I like this toy but I was surprised at how sharp and spiky the spikes are. They really poke and could hurt someone. We gave it to our son anyway but expect that at some point we'll have to take it away because he's hurt someone with it. He's 14 and High Functioning Autistic.For him it's a good safe way to get a different kind of stimulation. He likes all sorts of tactile experiences. This one is sharp but it's safe enough that it wouldn't actually puncture the skin.
5,Fiance LOVES this lil guy!,My fiance fell in love with Bastardino and Porpotina! cool lil guys with sharp spikes... I definitely wouldnt reccomend this product for small children... other than that... they are great little display characters!
1,Only 15 mins. long.,This relaxation cd is only one track and is 15:55 mins. long. Not exactly worth the 25.00 dollars I spent on it. Save your money and buy something else.
3,Slightly Misinformed...,"I didn't realize this DVD was two movies, with ""Moon 44"" a non-Stargate movie. Silly me...I should have read the fine print. I do not understand why these two moves are joined together like this. Probably in that fine print somewhere...;)""Moon 44"" is a good movie...and ""Stargate"" speaks for itself...GREAT!"
3,Stargate AND Moon 44!,"The tie-in of these 2 movies is the team of Director Roland Emmerich and writer/producer Dean Devlin. Dean actually stars in Moon 44; he's sort of a poor-man's Matthew Broderick.Moon 44 predates Stargate and is much more low-budget. It is darker and a little bizarre. The premise: send a bunch of fresh-faced boy cyberjockeys to live on a mining colony in space with a bunch of burly violent convicts and team them up to pilot spaceships to defend the colony. That's not a recipe for trouble, oh no. There's even a creepy shower scene.And people wondered why they paid Jaye Davidson $1 million to do Stargate? Uh huh."
1,"Worthless, Dated, A Complete Waste of Money","Many of the people listed in the pdf. are dead; a shocking number of the supposed celebrities can be contacted only through a medium. Unless you're interested in communing with the spirit world, skip this volume entirely. A complete waste of money, with incomplete addresses, typos galore, contact numbers through agencies rather than personal info; a complete waste of your time, and your money."
2,Mediocre,"Cool to see some of the cars, but the reviews were fairly superficial and watching him tear up cars just wasn't very interesting."
3,"Generally good, but recommended with reservations","Korngold's music is spectacular, and I would recommend it do anyone. I also agree with other reviews I have read for this disc that the music for Between Two Worlds is generally well performed. The DSO-Berlin (former RIAS Orchestra) is a top-notch orchestra, but the second movement of the Symphonic Serenade is utterly amateurish. I kid you not, it sounds at times like a student orchestra. The third and fourth movements are generally solid, but overall there are many patchy parts in the playing--weak coordination, intonation problems, and so forth. But given the paucity of quality recordings of these pieces, this disc is still well worth getting."
3,"a curious, sometimes frustrating mix","What my title means id that some pieces, or parts of some pieces, sound to me like Korngold at his inventive and lyrical best, while others sound trite or like 2nd rate movie music.K. is, as we know, an expert orchestrator & these pieces show that,which makes the shortcomings more frustrating. Do I consider the disc worth buying?If you are a K. fan, yes. If you are not familiar with his music, try something like his opera DIE TOTE STADT. ANd go to the library and check out some other titles. You may find things that appeal enough to warrant buying them."
1,Tastes healthy too!,"I have tried several recipes out of this book and have decided that I can do better. Some of the recipes are average and some are almost inedible. True, they do seem rather healthy and I have lost weight trying the recipes, but it is probably because I'm not eating much!"
1,"File pockets? No, just one","This is a single, unpackaged,paper file folder.Can't believe I paid over $5 for only one folder. Sure missed that in the fine print."
4,K&N 57-2519-3 Fuel Injection Performance Kit Gen2 Air Intake Kit,"I bought this product for a 2003 Ford Mustang GT. It took about an hour to assemble and attach. The only issue I had was getting the filter, 2 gaskets, the heat shield, and the maf sensor on together with the screws they gave me. I can tell a difference in the hp and its too early to tell on mpg. I would recommend this product over the other intakes out there because of the warranty and that the product lives up to its guarantee."
2,Less than,"I purchased this for my now ex. At the same time, I purchased a heat shield or window shade from another vendor for a BMW that was slightly more expensive. It is now more than a year later.This Jeep window shade does work. Unfortunately, it is flimsy and thin. So with usage, it has several creases and flops over if not installed just so. The BMW window shade is at least three times thicker and with a felt-like interior, reflective exterior. Its cardboard like construction allows it to stay in place with careless installation. Its thickness contributes to a cooler interior.While the Jeep ""heat shield"" does reduce interior temperatures somewhat, in comparison to another, it is not nearly as satisfactory."
5,Another Great Book by Shirley Jump!!,"As usual Shirley Jump came through with another great book! Easy to get into, hard to put down-I don't think any serious contemporary romance reader will be disappointed. I wasn't!!"
5,They just get better and better!,"What an awesome read!! I have read all of Shirley's books and they just keep getting better and better! I would have to say that this is my favorite so far. I loved the female main character, Olivia, and how she comes to really learn about her true self. The twist with the male main character, Daniel, near the end, was a huge surprise - but one that added a great turn of events. The story is a fun and fast read, filled with great recipes and lots of fun romance between Olivia and Daniel! Highly recommend!"
1,Expensive piece of junk!,"My wife and I did a bunch of research on this piano, and read many reviews. Most seemed very favorable. She also noticed that it won a Dr. Toy award. Imagine our surprise when we received this piano and half of the keys produced basically no sound. They produced a dull thud of a noise, but certainly no real piano sound. The keys were all extremely loose and some did not come back up once they were depressed. Each key had approximately 1 inch of movement in all directions.Now I have no idea if were just very unlucky and got a dud, but at $200, this thing is worthless."
4,great cooker,"got this to brew with and a 60 quart pot. the burner is very good and it pumps out the heat. at 60,000 BTUs it matches the 10+ gallon brew perfectly. you can go smaller for a 5 gallon batch, but try to match the pot size to the BTUs so that your time to full boil is quick. i do get a little flash back when i am turning this off. slower shut off seems to reduce that. seems like i get 4 full 5 gallon beer batches out of a propane tank with this on high for most of the time. heat plus boil time is taking about 1.5 hours. it's stable. you do have to reach in a ways to light it with a lighter (the long kind)."
3,Pretty Good Product,The burner came packaged nicely. The only problem was the actual burner is held on by 2 small tack welds which either broke in transit or were not properly tack welded from factory. So now I need to take it to a buddy's house to get it welded. Not worth the hassle and waste of money reshipping it for a new one. It looks great and hopefully my experience is just a random one. I would probably recommend it to a friend but only because I know that if something happened to it we can weld it or whatever needs to be done. If someone isnt very handy or have the correct tools I would probably recommend shopping around and doing a thorough review of products available before buying this one. Like I said though I probably got the unlucky one out of a thousand.
2,Mostly Common Sense,"I really didn't find anything too helpful in here. Most of the information was common sense or for people who really don't have a clue how to run a therapy session. If you just go to a session or two as a patient (instead of a therapist), you will have this book down."
5,Great,What can I say. I'm a big fan of Brian Crain and love every album recorded by him. A must buy album.
2,"bland, poor tasting cherries",I ordered these because I love dried cherries to eat plain and to bake with as well. I was disappointed when I tried them after having arrived - they taste like a cross between raisins and dried stawberries. I would not recommend buying this product
3,Not for Itsy Bitsy Babies,"So, this is a board book, and quite a cute one at that, and the colors and stories are very much for young children, but due to construction the warning, ""Not suitable for Children Under 36 months due to small parts"" appears on the back cover. We noticed it after purchase and now have to wait to give it to our son. We were very surprised that the book appeared to be created for infants and then wasn't. Five Stars for Content and color. Negative two stars for making it for older children."
4,Braided contacts,They work ok.They are kind of tuff to put on the car.They are just like the originals that are on the new Revell cars sold today.
3,More about Mingus,"An important contribution to the existing material about the great jazz composer/bassist.I give the book a medium rating because it can't seem to decide what it wants to be -- a love story, a ""portait of the artist as a dying man,"" or collected anecdotes about a master musician and enormous personality. My bias is that I was hoping for the latter.There's stuff here about Mingus that you won't get anywhere else because it's written by his soulmate. Sue Mingus may tell us a little bit more about herself and her background than music aficianados may want to know, but she is a very good writer and has quite a story to tell."
4,Really interesting.,I'm finding it difficult to pick it up but when i do i find the anecdotes interesting and well written.
3,Dry bones,"Well written, just not very interesting. I was led to this book by Peter Hessler's third book, Country Driving, which was far more involving and exciting to read."
5,EXACTLY what I need to succeed!,"A rare find- if this is the only book you buy on creating high-impact presentations, it will be the best investment you ever made for your organization! I have been following Mr. Endicott's articles with PRESENTATIONS magazine for some time now, so I was excited to see he was sharing his expertise by authoring ""The Presentation Survival Guide"". The book is small enough to fit in a briefcase, laptop bag, purse, or even pocket. It is a perfect tool for creating professional presentations, and presenting them confidently. The substance, invaluable tips and easy-to-follow, precise content make this book impossible to pass up. Mr. Endicott's reputation as a respected industry expert is only solidified further with his latest piece of work. You will be amazed at how it transforms your presentations- it certainly has for ours!"
2,Concise is not always better,"The book comes in a surprisingly small package. It can be easily slipped into a pocket. This attracted me to it and raised my hope that it would be practical and to the point. Unfortunately, it was not even a rehash of other guides to presentation skills. It spends too little time on the nuts and bolts of preparing and designing the presentation and too much time on the audience. It gives precious little attention to styles of the presentor. After reading the book twice I realized that I got what I paid for, an inexpensive book with little new or useful inofrmation which did not really add much to the already available literature on the subject."
4,My Girlfriend loves this...,Anime isn't one of my favorites I'm more of a sentia/Power Ranger guy my self...but my girlfriend loves these movies I couldn't have found a better Christmas gift. And the seller was awesome received it sooner then I thought I would and he was prompt on the shipping proccess as well...
5,Purchase of Sailor Moon: Dream Set Edition,"I received my purchase with in the allotted time, I really haven't looked at it yet as it is a Christmas present for my daughter, but, my daughter had this particular edition before but it was ruined by her youngest daughter. To be honest, I like Sailor Moon also, and was willing to replace for their and my watching enjoyment."
5,great movies ever!!!!!!!!,The movies where one of the greatest things I ever saw because when I was just 5 years old I started watching SAILOR MOON from season 1 an is one of the greatest cartoons I have ever seen on T.V in my in tire life? My next thing is to show them to my future children sow SAILOR MOON will still be remember.
1,Bad News For Believers and Skeptics,Yet another video from UFO hangers-on who drain others of information they have spent years collecting and then present it as their own. Believers and UFO Buffs will find this boring and useless. Skeptics will not even waste their time trying to wade through this endless video nightmare.
2,"I could ""identify"" most of these unidentified flying objects","If you expect to see the strange ""jellyfish"" UFO cloud that's on the cover of the DVD, you won't, it's not in there. Most of these UFOs are planes, helium balloons & weather baloons, high-tech projections, however there are about 4 footages that are really amazing."
4,"A great collection of UFO footage, but beware!","I anxiously awaited the receipt of this DVD. Imagine my surprise (and irritation) at discovering this material was released on VHS as UFO-The Footage Archives (with an added CD-ROM contained the MJ-12 documents and other material). I bought that set (3 volumes) less than a year ago, and gave it a good review (published by Amazon) then, so I am giving it a good review now. In fact, it is recommended over the VHS version. It has added material, can be slowed down for frame-by-frame viewing, and cost less than the tape set. Still, it is irksome to find that the same material has been repackaged, renamed and resold. Someone is making money off the UFO phenomenon."
2,"boring, explainable, fake","This DVD was originally released on VHS under the title 'UFO: The Footage Archives'. It has about five and a half hours worth of footage on two DVDs.I got this from an amazon seller for just a few dollars. Personally I don't think it's worth it even if you can get it cheap. Alls this is a collection of mostly uninteresting video clips from about the 50's to almost present day, with objects that they claim are UFOs. This doesn't really have any commentary, it just has text that shows up on the screen like a story right before the video clip is shown. Watching this is like watching a project put togeather by high school students. The title claims this is evidence but there is really little evidence. Just a collection of questionable, boring, poor quality video clips."
1,Awful. avoid it,"My first contact with Ute Lemper was ""Berlin Cabaret Songs"", a fantastic disc that I listen often.Afterwards, I bought ""But one day..."". It is not in my collection anymore.I bought ""City of Strangers"" given the good critics it has in Amazon, specifically by Mr. Marols.Well, it is a question of taste: if you like music without rythm, without armony, and without anything else, this disc can be for you. If not, avoid it."
1,I DONOT WANT IT. I TRY 5 TIMES TO CANCEL IT.,I DONOT WANT IT. I TRY 5 TIMES TO CANCEL IT. IT WOULD NOT LET MY CANCEL IT. PLEASE CANCEL IT.
5,good movie,I have always loved this movie and the quality of this dvd is very good. I'm glad I found it to own here.
1,The Yearling,This product came in VHS I don't have a machine to watch it. I could not find any information telling me it was not a DVD. so I am vary unhappy with this product.
2,Everybody Dies,"My cousin and I nicknamed this movie ""Everybody Dies"", because it's true, too many people die! It's very sad! I've seen movies where one of the main charecters dies, but this was just ridiculous! Disturbing, and occasionally farfetched, I would NOT recommend this movie. Buy something worth watching with your money."
1,This movie made no sense,"I don't understand what the big fuss is about this movie. It took more then an 1 hour to establish the plot and anyone that knows deer's it was only a matter of time before the deer was going to start too acted wild. I also didn't understand why the father didn't call his son by his first name. He kept calling him boy through out the entire movie. I guess back in the 40's that children called that parents by Ma and Pa. The parents didn't call there children by there names either they said son or daughter or I guess boy and girl.I'm not going to tell you how it ends but there's not much in this movie that will keep you interested. I loss interest about 15 minutes into this movie because there's no action, rhythm or anything at all as I said before to keep interested. Base on that and I'm indeed being nice about this I give this movie only 1 weasel stars."
1,Wretched,"They feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions. They blame bears and deer for ""misbehaving"" by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger."
2,"Not much plot, bad acting","I saw this movie on one of our TV movie stations about a month ago. I don't know why I watched it, it was a waste of time. There didn't seem to be much of a plot and the boy was an absolute horrible actor."
2,"Will Make You ""Cry""","This movie will make you cry, but not for the reasons stated. I thought this would be another ""Old Yeller"" or ""Where The Red Fern Grows"", but it just doesn't come close. The main reason: the boy. He cries too much, and sorry to say, he acts like a girl. It was hard for me to overcome this and enjoy the movie."
4,HUH ?!,Does it strike anybody else kind of odd that the DVD cover art for this film features a mountainous background ? The entire story is set in Florida !?
5,perfect transaction,"The Kiss by Tanya Chalkin poster I ordered arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I am very pleased with the process, thank you."
2,"Bowie fans, add as many STARS as you want...","First I am not a Bowie fan but I do recognize his artistic merrit. I am familiar with all his hit songs over the years. For sure the 62 year old glam rocker has been resilient for nearly forty years, forever reinventing himself. ""Collection"" is not the disc to begin with! This set is an insider between Bowie and his most devoted fans. The program encompasses selections of the twelve albums from ""Space Oddity""(1969)thru ""Scary Monsters""(1980). There is nothing on this CD that would make me want to run out and buy the complete albums. Not a single tune stuck! No lyrics or annotation is included so there is no chance of absorbing any details, for a deeper feeling for Bowie beyond his hits. Instead the packaging strangely lists the tracking for each album and nothing else. So in my opinion this is not the place to start your exploration of the evolution of David Bowie's music. Please Bowie fans don't be insulted!"
3,"Okay, but the battery compartment costs it some stars","This brush works great when it's fully charged. It leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.HOWEVER, once the brush runs out of batteries, it is a struggle getting the battery cover off. Actually, neither me, nor anyone else in my family has been able to complete that task. I've had to replace the brush about three times, because it was THAT hard to get the battery cover off. So, my recommendation is, if you are a weight lifter, or you are really good at tug of war, then this toothbrush is for you. If not, have fun replacing it every two months."
3,There's Better,"This brush was okay, but I don't recommend it if you have sensitive teeth of small ( not adult ) teeth. I suppose it is worth the money, but if you have extra to spend, buy the Sonicare or something. It is very loud and, oh, well, I guess it's allright, but I personally prefer a reg. brush."
2,For Strong Hands Only,"Good luck pulling off the battery cover in order to replace the batteries. Maybe it would be easy if you have super hand strength, but the mortals in my family find this to be a daunting task. If not for this rather poorly designed battery cover, the Spinbrush Classic would deserve two additional stars. I have not yet tried the Spinbrush Pro, so I have no idea if it is any easier to remove its battery cover."
5,Accessible ad Lively Translation,"I have a hard time reading poetry of any kind, so this translation really resonated with me. Plus, Lawrence was a man of action as well as scholar and intellectual, and I feel this gave him greater insights into the travails and adventures."
1,Don't trust this guy,"This book is not very good the same information can be found in five minutes on the internet. Any Dr. who uses an honorary degree after his name is suspect. Dr. Garry Gordon does not hold a valid MD degree, he is a DO and should only use that degree after his name. Although a DO deegree is an equivalent medical degree, the fact that he uses a fake MD degree shows his insecurity about his credentials. Further, his is a strong proponent of chelation therapy which is a fraudulent medical practice. He is a radiologist not a heart specialist as the commercial states."
4,It's a hub. 'Nuff said.,"It's a hub, and it does it's job well. Only one weird thing I'm noticing is that it appears to support only half-duplex (instead of full-duplex) on it's ports. But other than that, it works great. Just plug in all your stuff, and off you go. The network traffic indicator lights are great for seeing what's going on and how ""strained"" your hub is. This is perfect for a small office or home network, but if you are going to be dealing with nonstop traffic/bandwidth, I would probably go with buying a switch instead of a hub."
5,WOW! DIDN'T KNOW I COULD HAVE SUCH A STABLE AND FAST MODEM!!,"i can't believe it! i have a cable modem that i used with the hub and connected it to 5 other computers. it works great and the modem is very stable... i highly recomend this to anyone that wants home-networking. it is easy to use and i connected a cable modem to the hub using a router and with no hastle, it worked like a dream!"
1,uninspired and inaccurate,"Far from depicting the life of the founder of the Zen school of Chinese Buddhism, this film is more or less a glorified kung-fu movie in the typical fashion of that genre of chinese films with interspersed lame attempts at philosphical discourse, and offers little insight into the character of Bodhidharma, Buddhism or the beginnings of the Zen School in China."
2,How not to win friends and impress people.,"I met the author of this book in Finland recently. I thought, when I was given the book, that I was going to experience something extraordinary. What a disappointing book this is.I always imagine performing artists to have big generous natures. This was blown to bits by reading about the mean spirited activities of this author. Does he realise that he comes across as a most unpleasant person? He mows down everyone in the path of his fearful egoism.Helsinki is a small town, and now I cross the road to avoid the author when I see him coming."
5,Franois Couperin !,"Franois Couperin is one of Frenchs best baroque composer. He is not widly known, but his music is one of the most expressive in that era. This edition contains all the orders from Couperins first too ""books"" plus the first order of the third ""book"". Of all the pieces, I think I can quote ""Les baricades misterieuses"" (the misterious barricades), of the sixth order, which is one of the most popular and enchanting pieces Couperin ever composed.In conclusion, Dover reached it's goal by offering musicians the best music at the lowest price possible in a fairly good edition."
1,zero stars,"unfortunately, there is a tendency to believe that just because something is about God it is actually good. This simply is not the case. the poetry is bad--I've heard better from highschoolers performing.The author, who I actually saw live, is an egomaniac using God to benefit his own ego. Only too ready to talk about his suffering and inability to make it big, the greatest moment of irony was when he whined about being an outcast and didn't even mention a certain outcast who was crucified for walking with the most hated and downtrodden of Jerusalem's population."
2,bleck,"I am not real crazy for the ""taste"" or lack there of of this product BUT I am paying for the healthiness of the product so I guess what did I expect. This is the first coconut chip I have ever purchased/eaten. So I am going to suck it up and eat them. They are good for me you know."
2,Was this a Porno or Dance Tape,"Oh my Goodness, good thing I am good with that sort of thing and I own my own lingerie site too. But the moves were not more than about 10 minutes if that, and all of a sudden they were practicing at home and getting it on, all body parts out, nothing to the imagination. If you want this to explore other things than dancing then get it, but if you TRULY wanted to learn some erotic moves look elsewhere. I am looking for something that actually does show ruotines for dancing ONLY. I can rent a porno if I wanted it for the rest of this."
1,The movie Showgirls has better dance instruction!,"Starry Night described everything perfectly. When you can find it new for under $10.00 with shipping it reminds you of the addage ""You get what you pay for"""
1,Unfortunately I can't give it 0 stars,"We have used this textbook in teaching an accounting course for many years. This edition has completely dimmed our view of the publisher. They have eliminate the T-accounts and debits and credits sections and moved much of the other materials to a website. The question is why would a person pay more for less.The good news is that the editor of this edition was fired; the bad news is that we are unable to switch texts so closely to the beginning of semester.My advice - buy the 10th edition if you can obtain it. It is much more user friendly and contains solid information, the differences are minor and you actually get more material for your money."
4,Recommended text at USC's Executive MBA program,"I didn't buy this book - it came as part of my tuition at the University of Southern California (Go Trojans!!!) Marshall School of Business's Executive MBA program tuition.I really liked the book whenever I did manage to find time to read the text. The example are practical, and I now see how a good knowledge of financial accounting can benefit a General Manager, especially when it comes to valuation of securities, and even general accounting principles.It helped that we had an absolutely amazing professor - Mark DeFond - teach us the subject.Cheers!Kirit."
2,Get what you pay for (if you buy used),"I do not recommend buying this device NEW.Bad:* My device's video recordings have no audio. Works when you do a factory reset then the installation of Palm's software and sync.* Audio cable hookup to listen to music fails* Audio recordings of any kind frequently fail* Poor reception* Software keyboard is impossible to get to, which makes unusual characters impossible (e.g. the tilda ""~"" or any bracket characters {, [, }, ].* Hard to use, unintuitive, not very drag-and-drop friendly, pretty much not an iPhone in any way shape or form* Can't seem to set the volume of the ringer, seems to keep resetting.Good:* Its a Palm device that works with most Palm stuffThere's a reason its so cheap."
3,book full of misspellings,"Though I have this book and love it,I would not recommend this particular item since it is full of mistakes in spelling and punctuation. I do not see how this book slipped past the proof readers. I ordered 3 of them to give as gifts and had to return them. Please do not misunderstand. This is an excellent book and very inspiring. It is also very hard to find. So far I have been unable to find good copies, but I am still looking. I would buy 5 at least for gift giving."
5,Enables you to revisit the 1996 presidential election,"I got to revisit the 1996 presidential election when I listenedto THE CHOICE, Bob Woodward's insightful account of therace between President Bill Clinton and Senate Majority LeaderBob Dole.It was a behind-the-scenes view of what took place in eachcamp . . . though the outcome never seemed in doubt, I stillliked how it made me appreciate the ups and downs ofwhat has become a two year trek to lead the nation.I also became more aware of Clinton's political brilliance . . . inaddition, THE CHOICE made me think more highly of Dole--alongwith his wife Elizabeth (who methinks might have been aneven better candidate for the top spot).The narration by Tony Roberts added to my enjoyment of this book."
4,The choice is clear: Woodward is great!,"Engaging, insightful and entertaining. The Choice is a fast-moving book which clearly defines the stakes of the 96 elections and the strategies used by both democrats and republicans to win the White House."
4,Still instructive. Get it before you vote.,"I have read several of Woodward's books over the years and each new publication seems to surpass the last in its hurried prose. Woodward and staff were obviously in a race to get the book in print as soon as possible after ""the choice"" became irrevocable. Still, the book gives us a good sketch of the character of two men, and to some degree their wives, who will continue to influence the lives of all Americans into the next century. Recommended reading before you vote in November"
4,Very impressed,"Dated, yes, but well researched, well written and lots of learning lessons for todays campaigns. Each organization has fairly similiar issues-communications, goal setting and achieving, execution and more. Campaigns have all this but are temporary and time/deadline based. Decisions will results in wins or loses and the learning lessons might take years to learn. While Mr. Woodward does not have a monoply on the study of campaigns, he shows by his constant meetings with the campaigners of 1996 an inside view of the deicision making process. Well worth the time to read."
2,For hardcore political junkies only.,"Want to relive all the action and excitement of the 1996 Republican primarieszzzz...? That's right, over 400 pages and it doesn't even get to the general elections! (Which were pretty boring, too, of course.) A few telling observations, which can be summed up here and save you from reading the book: First, how Clinton and Dick Morris made an end-run around campaign finance laws by having the Democratic Party pay for ""issue"" ads slamming Dole and Gingrich. Second, how the Republican Party establishment felt it had to prevent party outsiders like Buchanan and Forbes from seriously challenging for the nomination.At one point, Woodward refers to the phenomenon known as MEGO (My Eyes Glaze Over). He could have been talking about his own book. Do not read before operating heavy machinery."
3,Ultimate Bass Boat... Maybe,"Not what I expected, not the depth I wanted. This would be a good book for someone who is getting into the sport.It is a very broad overview of what a bass boat is, the various components, i.e. motors, engine, electrical, etc. There some tips to help organize and rig your boat, maintenance schedules.Negatives , particularly for the cost of the book, was lax editing, many photos had the wrong caption, type set inconsistent, predominance with one brand of boat. I felt I was reading an advertisement at times.If I had a chance to thumb through it at a store I probably would not have bought it. But I am an engineer and I have restored a couple boats in the past years.Bottom line... if you are a novice, and want to know more about your boat or are planning to purchase a boat then this book would be a good addition to your library."
3,Andalucia Travel Map,"In July, 2005, I travelled to Andalucia and as soon as I arrived in Sevilla I also bought the Andalucia map by Michelin, and, since I used both, I can tell you that the Michelin is MUCH better. More detailed, easier to understand and to follow, more precise."
5,Great books,My 7 year old granddaughter fell in love with this series this year. She will be ecstatic to receive this set at Christmas.
5,Good book series,Magic Tree House books are always a hit with my grandkids. They read them over and over again. The price I received on this set was really good.
4,Great books!!!,My mom bought me these books separately. Wonderful books for 5 to 8 year olds. I really liked them. I had my mom read them to me and then I read them myself when I was old enough. They are great books for kids who like to go on adventures.
5,Great books for little boys.........,"We read one or two chapters a night to my 5 1/2 yr. old son everynight. He loves all the topics that the books cover....dinosaurs, pirates, ninjas,etc. Great for any little boy!"
4,Magic Tree House,"This set was sent to great-grandchildren I never see, and they were elated with this set. Will send them more."
5,Great books!,We got these for our 5 and 6 year old nieces for Christmas and they love them! These were priced amazingly as well'
5,Reading Books beats watching TV!!,"I purchased the Magic Tree House books for my eight year old granddaughter. She actually started reading other books by Mary Pope Osborne in first grade. She loves Osborne's books, so we decided to get the Magic Tree House Series and see if she enjoyed them as much as the others she had read in first grade. Well, she loves them and has them by her bedside and reads them every night before going to sleep. I plan on purchasing them for my other 6-1/2 year old granddaughter real soon. Fun, fun stories!"
5,This is a Christmas gift.,My daughter suggested this series because my grandson loves them. That's all I can tell now.
5,"Great Price, I paid under $15. for the set w/free ship!!","Nice giftable presentation when it arrived, just a bow and go!My DS is 9 and reads well over his 3rd grade level, however, he and his classmates are all raving over this series and the Magic Schoolbus too."
5,Great Books for a young boy to read,"It takes a lot for me to get my son to read anything. But with these books he read them with euthusiam and read each one within a week.Magic Tree House Boxed Set 2, Books 5-8: Night of the Ninjas, Afternoon on the Amazon, Sunset of the Sabertooth, and Midnight on the Moon"
4,Great concept!,What an interesting idea for the kids to escape to a new imaginary world in each book -- at least that's what I gleaned from a very quick review.
5,Child's Books,These books were requested by my friend for her child for Christmas. Must be good to request same.
5,Nice books,My 6 year old female niece loves these books. They are good quality paper books for the price.
5,Great children books,"These books are great, each and every one in the series. My kids read them over and over again."
3,Okay,"These books have a LOT of good points, and I won't dwell on those because so many other reviewers have done so. My kids enjoy them, they're full of actual information, and they have a lot to offer. I am continually disappointed by the grammar and usage errors found in these books. It seems to me that you can still write in a lively, simple fashion without fragmented sentences. Young readers need the best examples available to immerse themselves in so they can easily learn to use good grammar themselves, and to spot errors instinctively.I don't mean to be hard on the author, these are really great books, I'm just always frustrated with this one factor."
4,Love 'em,My son loves these books and they make good book report material and I don't mind the stories either.
5,HE LOVES THEM!!!!!!,"My kid adores these books. Hes in the first grade and asks, no begs to read at least5 a chapter a night."
4,Good country cooking and warm country memories!,"This book was a life-saver for a woman who married a man used to country cooking! The author grew up about half a mile from where we live and his memories of how life used to be around here are fascinating. The book is full of humor and, of course, plenty of wonderful country recipes (I didn't even know there was such a thing as wilted lettuce until I met my husband's family!) Great read for historical value even if the recipes aren't what you are looking for."
3,"Wonderful music, but not the best choice","A CD with a similar title (Psycho: Great Hitchcock Movie Thrillers) includes the exact same five tracks on this CD plus 2 more:SPELLBOUND Theme (Miklos Rozsa) (4:46) - Stanley Black & the London Festival Orchestra and Chorus (arr.: M. David), 1963ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS TV Theme (Gonoud: Funeral March Of A Marionette) (4:39) - Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Conducted by Alexander Gibson, 1965"
3,Too wordy!,"Ok, so I think the recipes in the book are worth the buy. However, for a seasoned cook this book is a little hard to swallow. I like the recipes and use them for inspiration. But whenever I read a recipe I roll my eyes because of how the recipes are written. I can't stand recipes that tell me that I need to peel an onion. No..... REALLY? Or a recipe that tells me how to pound out a piece of chicken. I am sick of reading the same sentences in these recipes. If you want me to add chopped and/ or sauteed onion to the recipe then please specify in the ingredients list so I know how to prepare it. Otherwise you are wasting my time. I thought the point of this book was to help me get dinner on the table faster. Reading pointless directions like these is really off-putting and redundant."
4,^-^ MKR2,"Yeah, I love MKR. Season 2 is good, but doesn't follow the Manga close enough...I still like this. I find that Nova, Hikaru's...uh...shadow is an awesome character, but she wasn't in the manga...but hey! It is still an awesome series from CLAMP and is worth every penny.Dvd boxset box looks MUCH better than the first season's did. Pretty...picture. (I'm obsessed with pictures, fyi.)One of my most hated moments in this season. I'm sorry to say this if you haven't watched this is that different from the manga, Eagel dies, which I hate! Thus why this is my least favorite of the MKR collection.My MK Rayearth rankings:1: MKR Magna (Direct from CLAMP's minds, of course.)2: MKR TV Season 1 (Yeah...it's BASED on the Manga by CLAMP)3: Rayearth OVA (Screwed up; twisted revamp of the story. Still cool.)4: MKR TV Season 2 (Yet again BASED on the Magna; THEY CHANGED IT TOO MUCH FROM THE MANGA!)"
4,Shoujo and RPG,"MKRayearth is a good start point to learn about different way to conduct a story. Sometimes it's very slow, as a way to show us that to solve a problem is not only a matter to have the answer. It's a way to show us the other Non-players characters, too. The western world usually thinks that coadjuvants are not important, so it's very unlikelly to develop them. It's a bit boring at first, but it's a way to understand ""the other side of the story"" and the bad guy. Otherwise it would be difficult to believe that kind of ""The End""."
4,Wonderful story aimed at girls with a curve at the end,Wonderful story aimed at girls with a curve at the end that can make you think about what it is to give your all to something larger than yourself. This is a story for dreamers not those old at heart. dvd has glitches on the extras but not during the shows themselves.
5,MKR 2,"For starter, MKR is one of the best series in the anime world. It contains friendship, love, truth, and believe. In MKR 2, Hikaru, Umi and Fuu once again return to Cephiro by an unknown force. They found out that once the dream land, Cephiro, is no more. Instead Cephiro is in danger and is crumbling away. With the threat of three neighboring Countries - Autozam, Fahren, and Chizeta trying to become the new Pillar and a new enemy Nova. The three Magic Knights need to fight to protect Cephiro once again.After watching this 7 DVD box set, I personally found that it is quite different from the original Manga series (I read the manga series before the anime series). I am somewhat disappoint that they omitted some of the events and secrets in the series. Also the love relationship and the ending is different from the original Manga series. I suggest those love MKR need to read the Manga series. But, MKR 2 anime series is still a really good animation work and should be treature by anime lover."
2,My expectations were low... yet they were not even met.,"Wow... I am really suprised that this set is getting so many positive reviews. I thought that this was an EXTREMLY SLOW series.First off, the animation is poor, yes, it is a little older, but it still does not compare to that of the Lodoss or Slayers series.The plot is not too unique, which isn't a big problem if the characters are well developed (because lets face it, all fantasy is pretty similar, its the character development that makes it a great Genre), unfortunatly, the characters are pretty poor. They go through few changes and they seem to never really learn from their mistakes. And their internal struggles are weak and repetive.I could only get through four of the DVDs before I forced myself to auction this series off. If you want good anime of a similar Genre, then look to the Record of Lodoss War, Slayers, or even a more expensive Fushigi Yugi."
4,excellent,"One reason early 1970s Vertigo releases hold up so well is they were progressive but not explicitly arty.This Gravy Train album is a fantastic example. Basically this is blues derived rock. But as many of the best progressive bands, Gravy Train did not try to reinvent the wheel, or make the wheel a symphony. A fresh turnaround here, an expansion of a bridge there, and the form was new with only subtle modifications.With the flute giving this music a sharp and welcome twist and roots deep in both jazz and blues, Gravy Train has not dated a bit.Excellent."
5,WOW THIS IS WOW,"i bought this book wondering how good it really was in the start but taking note from the reviews of this book i kinda knew what i was in for in getting this. THIS IS THE MAN, THE UNCLE FESTER. In reading all that i have so far i am shocked, almost to the point of hitting the floor. in the time that i have worked in the pyrotechnics field i have picked up a few things but not all that is in this book, knowing all that is in here makes me happy i got this book seeing as i am sure some time that it will be taken off the market due to all that is in this book."
5,A wonderful experience,"What other opera singer besides Luciano Pavarotti could attract half a million people to Central Park to watch him in concert? This concert of June 1993 was truly special. From the opening Verdi Overture ""I Vespri Siciliani"" played by the New York Philharmonic, you know you're in for a treat. Pavarotti sings an assortment of well-loved Arias, but what you don't really expect is the Duke Ellington classic ""It don't mean a thing"" sung by The Boys Choir of Harlem and also the traditional gospel number, ""I can go to God in prayer"". As out of place as they may seem in this context, they fit in perfectly. A wonderful album...anyone who loves Pavarotti will love this."
3,A RAP GROUP THAT GOT THE PARTY STARTED IN THE 90'S,"NAUGHTY BY NATURE MAY BE A RAP GROUP THAT WAS LEFT IN THE DECADE PAST.BUT THEY DID RULE THE 1990'S WITH THERE RAP ANTHEMS THAT GOT THE PARY STARTED.THEY WERE PLAYED 100X A DAY ON THE RADIO AND MTV AND WERE PLAYED AT ALL THE DANCE CLUBS.THIS BARGIN~BIN CD IS NOT AS GOOD AS THERE FULL~PRICED GREATEST HIT'S. BUT IT HAS SONG'S FROM ALL OF THERE HIT ALBUM'S;AND IT IS ALOT CHEAPER.HAS FEWER SONG'S BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE!.THE STRANGE THING IS THEY HAVE O.P.P ON IT BUT NO HIP/HOP/HOORAY.OTHER SONG'S ON THIS CD ARE O.P.P,FEEL ME FLOW,WICKEST MAN ALIVE,CHAIN REMAINS,THE HOOD COMES FIRST,CLAP YO HANDS & MORE!.IT IS FUN TO LISTEN TO RAP FROM THE 90'S AND RELIVE SOME OLD MEMORIES;AND THAT'S WHAT THIS CD DOES.{TONY~TONI~TON`E}/[ROME,NEW YORK]"
2,Bad Sibelius in a very thin performance,"Salonen is a pretty good Sibelius conductor, but this orchestra is not very good. The brass in particular is weak and badly intoned. I know this symphony well from many notable recordings, and the balances here are off, as are the slow tempi in the first and third movements. The finale is anticlimactic - maybe this group is just too small in number. THe female tympanist is excellent, and the woodwinds are good, too, but the strings are very under-nourished. This DVD is only 56 mins. long, very poor value,and this includes an inconsequential piece of Salonen's. The only sound offered is stereo, almost unheard of in new recordings, no surround at all!"
2,Pay for something more expensive... this smells NASTY!,"Bought the 9.5 ounce bottle of I-D Glide for personal purposes, and I don't really like it. It gets the job done, but it has two major flaws.1) It smells NASTY. It has a distinct, old-smelling, plastic-y and rubber-y odor that surrounds your general area when you use it. I've had other lubes, and none of them smelled this putrid.2) You need more than you usually would. This stuff seems to dry up and lose it's ""slipperyness"" fairly quickly, so you keep having to use more and more. In general, I need to use 3-4 times more of this than of, say, astroglide. Not worth it, especially with the smell.This does get a courtesy point because it works, though, and I will probably use the bottle up eventually. But I won't be buying this brand again."
1,information about I-D Glide.,"Hey we went for a trip and therefore was late for reviewing this item. We used it, but it was just like water and didn't help to smooth at all. I want to return it, but I think it already passed the data. Do you have some solotion for this ?"
2,It is not pleasure use it :(,"It is very sticky and heavy, uncomfortable use it. Neither my girlfriend nor I like it. Also, it get dry too fast."
4,Great lube ... what more can I say,"The product came very promptly and in excellent condition. This lube gives a nice tingling feeling, so may not be for everyone. Would definitely buy from again."
2,Not All it's Hyped up to be,"Dissappointed with this product,,,,expected better sensation for my spouse and myself. I've used other products and I won't be running out to order this again,"
2,Dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed with this product through the seller Hustler. I ordered ID Pleasure Lubricant (2) of them as a Christmas present which I did not receive. I had to send an e-mail through amazon to Hustler complaining about the very poor service. Shortly after this I received the item which I had ordered. After all of this I didn't even receive the ID Pleasure Lube which I had ordered and which it showed in the picture, I received the regular lube. Overall very dissapointed with the service I received."
2,Too oily,"This priduct the job of lubricating. It doesn't smell too bad either. My main problem with this product is it would not wash off easily and caused bad dryness to the point where skin was cracking, and you can ask any guy, it isn't fun when you got a burn or cut on your little guy lol."
4,Adequite,"It does pretty good as expected, but after awhile it starts to get sticky and dry up, but all other lubes are like that as well."
4,Dated but deeply helpful,"To listen to a scholar from earlier in the 20th centurymakes me realize how fully inclusive language has become the norm now.Aside from his language context, however, the depth of insightfrom this translator of the New Testament is well worth the read!"
4,Excellent Ancient Egyptian War Novel from 1991...,"Being Written during the 1991 Persian Gulf war,Costa alludes to the tragedies that wars bring, soit is not so much ""fight and loot"" as seen in Greek Tragedy.This book has magic, sorcery, gods, a trip to the EgyptianAfterlife, amulets, romance and betrayal, and most of all:battles! A genuine and original story from 1991-2003,buy it from Xlibris[...] or Amazon/Borders[...].I recommend this novel to Historians, Egyptologists, and Magicians alike.-S.M. Rhodes,Palm Beach, Florida, USA.:)"
2,Couldn't relate,"The author is a highly regarded teacher of acting and directing actors, but I found the material in this book, and her other book, inaccessable. I'm certain she knows what she is talking about, but I just couldn't get into the material, which seems to be written in a stream of consciousness manner. It lacks the meat I was looking for."
5,A Welcome Return To Intuition and Creativity In Filmmaking,"Film Director's Intuition has more ideas in it than any other book in the universe. This thing is dense. And deep.Judith Weston isn't afraid to tell the truth, even when it's ""counter-intuitive"" -- and that's why I trust her. Her ideas about famous films might sound rebellious, but I can already sense -- from the way she takes them apart in unexpected ways -- that her fundamental beliefs are shared by the great directors who made them. Her wisdom about the hidden layers of emotional events, subtext, and ""getting out of your head"" are refreshing. This is a welcome return to intuition and creativity, in an industry full of over-analytical, self-conscious, calculated junk.Film Director's Intuition was not written by a poser with a marketing gimmick -- this is timeless stuff. If you're an actor or director (or any artist) looking for a real book with more meaning than can be contained in a 6x9 stack of paper, then you've found it."
5,Essential reading for directors,"Because of the prejudice most people have towards art in general, and acting, directing, and storytelling specifically, there are certain individuals out there looking for how to manuals. They look at photography hanging on museum walls and say to themselves, 'What's so great about that? You just aim the camera and shoot.' They watch a movie and see actors speaking but have no idea how much effort it takes to make a scene even remotely watchable. This book and Judith Weston's other book, Acting For Directors, are essential reading for directors who want to learn to communicate with actors in a way that will inspire their creativity. They are not a set of instructions for putting together a gas grill. They are not filled with equations for attaining preordained results. They are books that teach directors how to approach a scene and how to tell the story they want to tell through that scene."
5,read this in 1 week,"I highly recommend this book. it's full of information and psychology, like any great self help book, but with your career of directing constantly in mind. i read this in a week and now will be purchasing her other book."
4,"We love it, the dog - so-so","We think he's hilarious, but the dog we bought it for wasn't too sure about the noise. Good dog for not wanting to chew up something that sounds like a human in distress!"
2,Dangerous parts - Not suitable as a dog toy.,"I bought this sight unseen for my sister's Labrador. I did not realize that it contained plastic parts and batteries that a dog might ingest.Because of those parts, I think this is not really a suitable toy for dogs.Happily, my sister's dog continues to enjoy the toy after the dangerous parts were removed."
1,The cutest toy I ever had...,This lamb was so cute I didn't want to share it with my dog. Obviously I should have listened to my selfishness. In less than 3 minutes my dog made a hole where lamb's eye was and half of the stuffing was out in no time. This was the first toy ever my 1.5 years old mini-schnauzer managed to destroy.
5,Cutiest Dog Toy!,Very durable. I remember back in the 60's watching this show. My poodle loves this toy the most and sleeps with it. This was my second puchase of this product. Too cute.
3,Poor lambchop,My 3 year old pug loved lambchop so much. Unfortunately lambchop lasted less than a week. Puggy torn his hind leg off and stuffing went everywhere.It's still a super cute toys but I would recommend for a more gentle dog than mine.
5,Mr Bill people toy,Why is this toy marketed as a dog toy? Great for watching Mr Bill and Sluggo with friends. I am going to buy more. It talks to.
5,Daisy loves Mr. Bill and Mr. Bill takes a lot of abuse.,"Daisy my Rhodesian Ridgeback / Labrador mix loves her Mr. Bills. With other stuffed chew toys she will have them shredded within a few days. Daisy has had 3 Mr. Bills. Currently she has an inside Bill and an outside Bill both of which have so far lasted about 8 months and are still going strong. Daisy has shredded the hands and arms on her inside Mr. Bill but his legs and body are still completely intact. Both Mr. Bills still seem to have plenty of ""Ohh Nooo"" left in them and are as loud and as sensitive to squeezing as the day she received them. She plays with her Mr. Bills daily so we're not just talking about an occasional thing here. Mr. Bill has far exceeded my expectation and it's a fun toy for the dog and a good conversation piece when people drop by and people love to throw it for her to listen to the ""Ohh Nooo"" when she grabs it."
2,brings back memories but voice box has a short life,"Mr. Bill is big, cute, and colorful, and sure brings back memories, but my German Shepherd had Mr. Bill's voice box crushed and inoperable in a day and his nose pulled off a week later. This voice box issue is a common complaint here. I'm no toy manufacturer, but with all the technology today, it seems like there would be a way to make the voice box safer and more durable."
5,My Dog Loves It!,"My dog loves his Sock Monkey, plays with it every day. The transaction whent nicly and arrived quickly, i will buy from them again."
5,Loads of Fun and Laughs,"Not only does my dog love this toy, but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him. He gets really excited when he hears the ""Ohhhh Noooooooo"" :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup, I had taken him to work. Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him! I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision. When the toy gets ripped, I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you, or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
1,dangerous dog toy,"This toy contains a battery, a speaker, springs, and other hard plastic parts. These parts can injure and possibly poison your dog. It took our Lab minutes to chew open a seam revealing the parts. Do not buy if you love your dog."
1,"Dog really liked it, lasted about an hour",This toy lasted about an hour before there was a hole the size of a quarter. The material is very loosely woven and our 8 pound puppy had no problems wrecking it quickly.Didn't last long enough for the cost. There must be more durable monkey toys around as I've seen them at the obedience club. This isn't one of them.
2,"Lots of fun, but stopped working","Got this toy as a gift. It was lots of fun for us and the dog while the noise maker worked (probably more fun for us). We have a heavy chewer so we only used this toy for training our dog to take things gently. Our dog never had it in his mouth for more than a few seconds. Even still, the 'Oh No' noise stopped working on the 4th or 5th use. Once that stopped working, it wasn't as much fun. I would not recommend this toy for any kind of unsupervised play, especially if your dog likes to chew. It's poorly made and the noisemaker inside feels like it could be dangerous to dogs if they got it out. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the entertainment factor of it being Mr. Bill and making the 'Oh No"" noise, otherwise it's really a 1 star dog toy."
2,cute but not durable,"This product is a must have for nostalgia buffs- unfortunately, our puppy ripped through it in a week, exposing its squeaker. Cute toy but not built for wear and tear."
4,Lambchop dog toy,This was our dogs very first toy. We got it before we brought him home at age 8 weeks. We rubbed it on all his litter mates before he left the litter. He slept with it his first nights with us. We took a picture with lambchop and our puppy when we brought them home. Our son saw the photo and thought we had two puppies rather than one. It lasted about three months with him playing with it many times daily. He uses it as a chew and a tug toy and loves that it has 5 squeakers. We now have a second one. He also loves to chase and fetch it when we throw it. It holds up well in both machine washer and dryer. The seams of the rear legs had to be repaired on the second when they came undone. The fabric on the muzzle is most prone to tearing.
2,awkward,"My golden retriever got Mr. Bill from an friend of mine. He adored it and was having great fun tearing around with it and making the Oh No! over and over. I'm glad I took a quick picture to send her because within an hour he had a red and white sack of crunchy plastic pieces. He still loves it but after reading other reviews I'll have to take it away so he doesn't cut his mouth or chew the parts. What's awkward is that this friend is coming to visit next week. I guess I'll pretend not to have noticed, like it just happened."
5,Highly Dog Approved!,"My rottweiler mix has enjoyed her Mr Bill doll for a few months now, & even though he doesn't have as many facial features as he started out with, he is still a great source of fun. She's so fond on him that she now recognizes the phrases ""Mr Bill"" & ""Ohh Noo!"" & will run to fetch him when you say those. She is more enthusiastic about this toy than any other she's ever had in her 4 & 1/2 years & on top of that, the stitch quality is far beyond previous squeakers & such. He's still in great shape, ohh yess!!"
3,"Great Toy, but too fragile for dogs","Our beagle loved this toy for about 3 days, until she pulled all the stuffing out of it, and crushed the plastic electronic voice box and speaker. At that point the loose small parts and batteries made it unusable as a dog toy.Great idea, needs better execution. I would buy more of these, because the dog simply loved it, but not until it is more robust.Bought another in 2012, and the fabric and construction is much more dog durable. Still being chewed on, and still shouting ""Oh No!!!"" today."
3,Monkey lost its tail,"Our dog likes to play with this toy, but its tail came off within five minutes. The dog did not chew it off or anything, it fell off while tossing it around the house for her to go fetch. Overall, its fun but not durable."
3,Watching this toy get DESTROYED is great,"My German Shepard loves destroying this toy. Watching Mr. Bill get decimated is a wonderful experience. That creepy circular mouth and yellow head with blue pants are just wrong on so many levels. Please buy this toy and let your dog completely tear this creepy, yucky Mr. Bill-toy to a fluffy mess. Watch justice done to all the scary criminals (Mr. Bill criminals). Satisfying on all levels. And your dog will love it."
1,Mr Bill doesn't sound like Mr. Bill and Dog Killed Him Quick,"I remember the high pitched, ""Oh no, Mr. Bill"" famous phrase. This doesn't sound like him; it didn't smell right to me; and my 27 lbs mini golden gutted him in less than five minutes. I had big fiber looking cotton balls all over the floor in minutes. Cute for... nothing. Save your funds and buy some bones. I do NOT recommend for dogs with teeth."
4,I Actually bought this for my husband not the dog!,"My hubby's favorite statement when something goes wrong is ""Oh No, Mr. Bill"" I bought this for a stocking stuffer gag gift. Now he wants to buy more. He wants one for the TV area so he can squeeze it when his favorite sports team messes up. The dog can play with it when the voice box goes out."
2,Mr. Bill did NOT say Oh No,"I bought this as a gift last yr. mainly because Mr Bill was supposed to say ""Oh No"". But it only made a little noise. However the gifted dog still loved it."
1,terrible toy for dogs,"I was given this toy as a gift for my dog for the holidays. After only a few minutes of play I noticed my dog chewing on something crunchy. I was in shock to see that inside was a plastic box with little batteries, springs, speaker and other small metal parts. I can not believe a company would make this for dogs. Not only did my dog cut its mouth, but it could have died chewing on the parts. CRAZY. do not buy this item."
1,Broke after 10 minutes...twice!,"I have a 10 lb terrier who is very easy on her toys. She loves the Multipet toys and I have a variety of them for her - she has some that are 2 or 3 years old and still working great. I got this one for her the other day and within 10 minutes of playing with it, the noise maker inside was broken (it felt crunchy and did not talk anymore). I figured it was defective and sent it back. I got the replacement and the same thing happened! 10 minutes of playing and it does not work anymore. I am floored because she is not rough; she is an older dog and barely even has teeth left! I'd recommend trying one of the other Multipets instead of this one, not sure what is the deal with it."
3,A good toy but will not last long for chewers,"This was another Christmas Present I allowed my 11# Bichon Frise Bailey to play with a bit early.She loves the fact that it says ""oh noooooooo"" and loved it when she could get it to say it.My major problem: within 3 minutes she had already ripped of part of his red and blue clothing. She is an agressive chewer, but the first 2 minutes were spent trying to get him to talk, so in reality it took all of 1 minute to rip off pieces of his clothing. That is a record for her. Soooo she really liked this toy, but I had top take it away so she couldnt get to the batteries.This would be a good toy if it was more durable. I will still give it to her, but it will have to be in very small closely supervised intervals (sadface for both of us).If you have a dog that is extremely gentle with toys than this is the toy for you. If not, then I would not recommend it, as it does have batteries internally."
3,Great Toy - Not So Durable,"My dog absolutely loves this toy, unfortunately Mr. Bill hasn't been able to stand up to the punishment. I've had to sew him back up twice in the last 6 weeks. My dog is on the large side (~60 lbs.), so your mileage may vary."
5,wonderful,"My black lab absolutely adores ""Mr. Bill"". It's the only toy she has not torn up. She carries him around and sleeps with him all the time. If you ask for him, she will give him to you but she doesn't take her eyes off of him til she gets him back. It you make him say ""oh nooo"" she will come running from where ever she is and grab him"
2,Oh Noooooo!,"This is a very cute dog toy but it stopped ""talking"" 2 1/2 hours after I gave it to the puppy."
2,The sunk monkey,"This product is a little deptive in its description. I expected a bigger toy. I purchased 2, when I released the 1st one to the ""kids"" to play with, the tail promptly separated from the body. So I released the 2nd one, and the nose separated from the body. Very poor quality product. I would not purchase again."
3,Holds up ok,This is a great toy; my dog really enjoys it. My shih tzu has really sharp teeth and he made it through the rear end of this toy within a couple days. While he did rip it open; he wasn't able to get all the stuffing out.
2,very disapointed,After less than ten minutes sock monkey had his arms pulled out of his sockets...two minutes later the stuffing was being ripped out of his head by a very nice poodle puppy... she is very unhappy her toy was thrown in the trashafter such a short time and so was I....don't waste your money.
1,Crappiest supposed dog toy ever,"The good news is, my 3-month-old Golden Retriever puppy loved the sock monkey. The bad news is, she bit the ear, nose, one arm, and the end of a foot off in less then five minutes -- no exaggeration. This is not a dog toy, it was made out of cheap materials. I'm more than a little annoyed to be out the money for something that went straight into the garbage. I spent more time picking up the shredded fluff and pieces of sock monkey than my dog did playing with this piece of junk."
5,OOONOOOO!,"This may be the best of all the Mutipet toys! Previously gave great reviews of others, but this one never stops! They bite it, step on it, sit on it and hide it from each other. It always gives itself away tho with its ""OOOOONNNOOOOOO!!!!"" I keep 2 around here and have given several to friends. I think it's particularly popular with those of us who remember Mr Bill, but it sure translates to the dogs!While these are really durable for us I don't think real chewers will take long to dismantle this. My guys are over 80lbs bot don't chew or pull things apart."
5,A real favorite,"This is my Standard Poodle's most favorite item. It is his buddy, his security blanket and tried and true companion. If given a choice, he would carry it from a fire before anything else. This is the second Bill we have had. The first has had two operations to keep him in service. This toy can also be washed in the washing machine. Yes, it was a surprise to me, too. I can only speak for my dog. Unfortunately he can not do it himself. It is his first and only love. He plays with his other toys, but he has his Mr. Bill next to him at the moment."
5,Loads of fun for dogs and people!,"We received Mr. Bill as a gift, and at first we thought Oh Nooo another stuffed toy that won't survive 10 minutes. To our great surprise, Mr. Bill remains intact three months later, and continues to be one of our dogs (and ours) favorite toys! Highly recommended!PS - our dog is an 18 month old, 36# Labradoodle!"
3,Didn't last very long,"My puppy loved this toy, but it ripped after a day. Now don't think I have some huge dog, he is only a 6 month 8 pound bichon/shih tzu. I don't know why dog toys are sewn with better quailty. Lamb chop's back ripped wide open after one afternoon of play. Great toy, but I wish it was made better because now I have to figure how to fix it so my money isn't wasted."
2,Broke in less than an hour.,The voice box cracked from use within one hour of the dog playing with it. And I'm talking a small dog. We bought one a few years back and it lasted almost a whole year.
4,Great Dog Toy,"I bought this for my friend Joan's dog, Katie. Katie would tear out the squawk box of any dog toy given to her. Not this toy.....It could be because the toy ""speaks"" rather than make a noise, regardless, it's a neat sight to behold. She treats this toy special and even takes it to bed with her. ""Oh no Mr. Bill"""
4,durable dog toy,"My poodle mix is a plush toy destruction ninja (PTDN for short). He has not yet met a toy he hasn't successfully disemboweled. However, this monkey stood up to his razor sharp teeth, and unrelenting drive to eviscerate for several months. Most toys, even the seemingly durable Kong squeek toy, last just a day or two. I would highly recommend, as this is a quality product overall and is a great size for a medium-sized dog. Taking one star away just because he was eventually able to rip the monkey's face off:)"
3,"Oh no, it's not Mr. Bill....","Not sure I would have bought it had I see it in a store. No one who has seen this toy is quite sure what it actually says (maybe its speaking its language of origin...Chinese, perhaps?) but it was good for a few laughs. And, its only a dog toy. It served its purposed....the dog was amused with it for a day."
3,"Cute, not for tough chewers.","This toy is cute. I like it, but my dog doesn't. He doesn't play rough with his toys, so this would be fine for him if he liked it. Because of the voicebox, I wouldn't suggest buying it for any dog that is likely to tear it apart."
2,"Cute, but...","Cute toy, but I got one with a broken squeaker. My dog gets bored with things that don't make noise, so this was a waste of money for me."
4,Bought for my neice,"I bought this for my neice's birthday but I think that the adults got much more enjoyment out of it then she did.It was fun reliving some of mr. bill's adventures and the evil sluggo.somehow, even at home thought, mr. bill takes a beating.."
2,Destroyed in 20 min,Not meant for chewers. Basically just a sock with stuffing. My dog destroyed it in less than 20 min.
4,So funny!,"This is a great soft toy. It's funny and dogs love it! My only complaint is it's kind of thin, so I don't think it will last too long, but it'll be fun while it lasts and the price was great!"
5,The Best,My old Mr. Bill toys are in shreds. My dogs look forward to getting their new ones. Happy holidays to all.
2,Disappointed!,I got this sock monkey dog toy for my poodle who is very gentle with his toys. We have had him for 4 months and he has never destroyed a toy. After having his monkey for less than 2 weeks the ear and the arm are already coming off. I would say this toy is not sturdy enough to be a toy for dogs.
2,Dog Loves It But It Works For About 10 Minutes,"Our dog loves Mr. Bill and takes him everywhere, but the voice box only lasts for an hour. I've gone through three of these in a week and am waiting for the fourth hoping this is the one. I'm not holding my breath. The good thing is that Amazon keeps taking them back and sending new ones via 2 day shipping."
2,sock monkey,People should not pay more than two dollars for this cheap toy. The quality is very poor even for humans. We have a very small terrier ( six lbs.) and in less than five minutes almost shook the tail and one leg off. We had a choice of resewing or pitching it. We chose the latter. Never again.
3,"Fun , not for a distroyer.","I bought this for my dog for Christmas, he is a big big dog 106 lbs, and distroys most stuffed toys in minutes. Mister Bill was no exception. I gave it 3 stars because it is cute and the noise box is funny and loud. We did rescue the plastic box and have had some fun with it, but the toy is a gonner. It is nice that it is not too expensive."
2,cute but dissapointing,"I bought this toy because my lab mix loves stuffed squeaky toys and I loved the look of the old fashioned sock monkey. It was an instant hit with her. I didn't even mind when the tail fell off the first day because she was having so much fun running around and squeaking it. She is not a big chewer and just loves to squeak her toys. Unfortunately, by the 5th day, the squeaker no longer worked so she doesnt want to play with it as much. I think for the price they could of put in a higher quality squeaker."
2,Pet Sock Monkey,"My dog chewed one of the ears off the monkey within 1 day, and she's NOT a chewer. For a dog toy, the product should probably be a little more sturdy."
3,"""Oh, Nooooooooo""","I purchased this for my daughter's dog which is a mix of pug and Jack Russell. Unfortunately it didn't last more than a week. The first thing to go was Mr. Bill's right arm. Then his voice box was ripped out. My daughter found the stuffing all over the house. I just wish there was a way to stuff these dog toys with a solid, yet soft material. It was a cute idea while it lasted!!"
4,Dudley Boyz,"Dudley Boyz had already left ECW to go to WWF, and they were given a ECW career overview. I think it is weird ECW released a best of set of two current WWF stars-Cactus Jack and this set. I wish they released best of sets of Raven or Sandman instead, but WCW was not paying ECW at the time. This set is well worth it and im not even a big fan of Dudley Boyz. The story flows well together, picture quailty is better then the Cactus Jack story, and matches are decent but not to amazing. I highly recommend this set to fans of the old ECW and Dudley Boyz.I notice they have two different Best of Dudley Boyz dvds. I dont think there is a difference, just the price."
3,Id give it 3.5 stars,"Although its not as good, or as long as ""The best of Cactus Jack"" DVD this one is quite watchable. Most of the matches are cut, I think there are only two that aren't, but it is quite entertaining to see the Exteme Dudley Boyz before the WWE toned them down alot. I think ECW could of put more information in for example, all of there 8 Tag Team Champ wins are on this DVD, but you basically only get the pinfalls, so that segment lasts about 2 minutes, when it could of lasted 2 hours.The DVD has a few extras, Dvons debut, an extra match and a farewell speech. If your a fan of the Dudleys or ECW I highly recommend this DVD. If you want to see some really hardcore action, I think thats where this DVD falls a bit short."
1,Software would not load,"Attempting to load the software for this reader resulted in an error and would not load. I atmepted on another computer with the same error message. (Both were laptops.) I then atempted to load onto a desktop PC. Here it loaded fine. After several attempts to solve this problem with tech support. We both gave up and decided this will not work on my computer, so I returned it. Full refund came promptly with out any hassel."
3,"Great idea, bad implementation","This Network Attached Storage device looks like a great idea, and it mostly does what it advertises. It does make 120GB of storage available over your network and is reasonably priced.There are some significant flaws. First, the user interface does not allow you to give someone read only access to a particular share. Buffalo could fix this simply by changing the firmware, and it really is a pretty significant oversight. The whole point of having network attached storage is to allow multiple users on a network to have different access levels to data.Also, the unit is sealed and thus does not allow the user to change the hard drive.There are other options out there. The Linksys NSLU2 will allow you to hook up USB drives to a network and does allow read only user level access. In additionl, Linksys also has the EFG120 which does the same thing, but has internal IDE hard drives which are user replaceable."
1,not in stock,"I not only ordered two pair of these shoes but then never received either pair of the full refunded price of the shoes,, how sad is that./"
4,keeps you up and insulated from the ground,I like it well enough as it does keep you insulated from the cold hard ground. Good for camping when you go to a camp ground and unload your car but I might try another one that rolls up for my back packing trips. It is light weight and has some give with its egg shell type material which I need as I tend to sleep on my side and without it wake up with an aching hip. One time while camping some rain got in the tent and pooled on the floor yet my sleeping bag stayed dry thanks to the therm a rest.
4,Good overview of past and current deco theories,"This book is NOT pedagogical, and thus is best suited for divers with good background in physics. The overview of most past and current theories is precise, accurate and efficient. I personally regret that the developments be so dramatically cursive. This book, very interesting, would, in my opinion, be much better (meaning much easier to read), if it was written in a more pedagogical way."
1,clam chowder???,"The product is very bland to start with, and the few tidbits of clams included (believe the most i noticed in any given can was 5 pea size or smaller pieces), just leaves too much to be desired. What a disappointmentin this product to say the least, it may be healthy, which I don't reallybelieve, but there is certainly little quality except in the outrageous profit margin! Oh, but plenty of potatoes to fill the space, and they aren't very tasty either! Final thought, if you don't wish to be irritated, avoid this product, unless you like exceptionally overpricedoverrated and overvalued items!!"
4,It is what it is,Pro: a convenient low fat clam chowderCon: it tastes like a can of low fat clam chowder
2,"Very watered down, does not taste like clam chowder",Purchased a case b/c it was on sale just to try it. Taste very bad. I had to add whole milk just to make it taste creamier. I would not buy again.
2,It's Definitely Not Chunky Soup,This product tastes okay; not great. It's definitely not the same texture or taste of Chunky New England Clam Chowder Soup. Once you add enough Saltines and pepper to the soup it tastes better but it's more watery and bland because it's healthier.
3,Average,"If you must eat low sodium this product is OK, but my husband and I found it lacking in flavor, and a little thin for chowder. Expected low salt but couldn't taste the clams. I assume there are some in there but not much."
1,Gak!,"I am not a finicky eater, and I love most soups. This stuff is terrible. Very thin consistancy, very few potatoes, an occasional bit of celery, ALOT of clam grit. I don't mind an occasional CRUNCH with my clam chowder, but with EVERY bit of clam? The taste is so bland (well of course - low sodium) I am giving the remaining cans to our local food bank. I am not even going to waste my time trying to ""doctor it up."" Weird that I feel guilty about donating food, but there it is."
3,It's just OK,"I thought it bland tasting, I've liked other brands better for thicker sauce, more clam meat, other brands filled me more. My hunger didn't feel satisfied with Heathy Choice Clam Chowder"
2,Thin and bland,"A ""healthy"" soup doesn't have to be bland. However, ""Healthy Choice"" has yet to learn that trick. My wife bought a few varieties of this brand and we are in the process of suffering it out of the pantry. As one reviewer mentioned, this is pretty lacking in any clams at all. However, even the addition of some celery would have improved both the consistency and taste of the soup. It was just crafted with no imagination whatsoever, with the intention that calling it healthy would be enough to make people think it OK to eat it. Well, it isn't in my mind. Regular Campbells or Progresso clam chowder is much better, and not that many more calories per serving. If you eat them for lunch with a sandwich, just choose a sandwich on which you can use mustard instead of mayo, and you've saved enough calories to eat a real clam chowder. This pale imitation deserves to go belly up."
1,Cans arrived dented and leaking,I purchased several cases of this soup last year but the the majority of the cans were either dented or leaking. Amazon sent replacements but they were also arrived in the same shape. It looks like this problem might have been resolved from the latest reviews so maybe I will try again. But my experience with actual product was not good. Amazon did refund the entire amount including shipping. That is the only reason I gave the product a star.
5,Great Book for teenagers or young adults,"This book teaches 61 short but excellent lessons concerning self defense. What impressed me most was that I was able to learn all these lessons in my back yard with a friend at the age of 16. My age now is 70 years old. Over the years I have used the methods taught to literally protect myself in several ""bad guy"" attacks, but more importantly these are methods that will allow you to control an encounter with out over reacting. By these I mean if some one is horsing around or just trying to bully you, you can turn the tables on him without smashing him up badly. If you need too the book will show you how to quickly end attacks with the force needed. If I had a son or grandson I would purchase this for him.I have kept this book for over 50 years, but I do not want it to end up in the trash so I may add my own book to the three that are now for sale. Highly recommended!"
4,Good Battery Charger,"This is a good recharging AA battery unit. I own both this one and the Kodak K2000 unit. ( AA battery usage in my household/business is rather common). This unit works just as fast as the Kodak unit, if not faster, and has most of the same features. But I like the Kodak unit better.The storage space of the device is very important to me. I don't like carrying around dead weight that could be eliminated. The Olympus unit is compact, EXCEPT for the extension cord, it takes up more room than the unit itself. The Kodak K2000 is a wall mounted unit, that does not require a cord. It fits perfectly into my camera bag, without any hassle. I've never had a ""loose"" wall outlet attachment with the Kodak, if I did, I would tighen it by pinching the plug slightly together.This Olympus system and the Kodak system both work very well. Both are compact, both recharge quickly. My preference is the Olympus at home, and the Kodak on the road."
3,Good Reading,Good reading this book if u are looking for a quick fix to winning the lottery this not it. but it does give some good insight to the games.
5,Best lottery book,"I think that this is the best book that I have read until now.The book is very helpful to those who try to understand the fundamental theory of lottery business.Above all, the strong point of the book is that the author explained many kinds of lottery very well."
4,The Unseen Battle,"I really enjoyed the book, The Unseen Battle, by Donna Hubbard. I was very impressed by Donna Hubbard's ability to show the battle between good and evil so clearly. This book really made me think about what battles and struggles we face on a day to day basis. If we only knew about the ""unseen battles"" going on day to day, we would probably be astounded.What also struck me was the fact that the author used some of her own actual life experiences to tell the story. I always enjoy a book more if I know that some actual, real-life experiences are woven throughout it.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading a wonderful, insightful novel. Whether you are a religious person, or not, this is a great story with a lot of spiritual insight. This book is a definite ""must read."""
5,A great resource for Bible study,"I love this commentary and will always use it with my Bible study. I can't say I agree with Jon on everything. He has in my opinion an extreme view of women in ministry (negative) and he does not like the gifts of tongues used in a church body in a meeting context, but I don't really know if that comes out in this commentary as I have used his website many a time and listened to a lot of his sermons. Even with that in mind though I just love the scholarship that he has but of course I check out many things when I study. I love some of the topical writings he has put in this commentary and would highly recommend it for all Christians. Jon is, in my opinion, a gifted teacher, preacher and very solid in the faith and would not hesitate to give a believer whether new or old one of his commentaries."
5,Jon Coursons application commentary: new testament,This is a wonderful addition to my weekly Bible study. It gives me a better perspective of the word.
3,HEADS UP...,"this book only discusses the NT and not OT at all. I do not think that is mentioned at all in the description. One would need to pay cost listed x 3 to get entire commentary as OT is divided into 2 separate editions (for kindle, can't speak for paper). Thankfully I caught it when I downloaded the sample."
5,great book,This is a remarkable commentary by Pastor Jon Courson. I have been listening to his teachings on line and I bought his cd sets of the Bible. Pastor Jon has been blessed with insights in the word of God that opens up the heart of the Lord to all of us that want to know him better. God Bless
5,Great commentary,Best commentary read so far. Will recommend this to everyone who studies the bible. This great for study groups. Buy it.
1,Good features...but poor reliability,"After receiving this system, I thought it was fantastic. The picture and sound was awesome. The remote was easy to use and intuitive. Then two weeks later, it started with intermitent failures. It could not read the DVD disks. It said ""no disk"" or ""insert disk"". Contacting Toshiba was no help. They said to clean the disk (I had 10 brand new DVDs) and also to unplug and repower after 5 minutes. It would work okay after being off overnight. Then after another week, it failed permanently."
3,can't play CD-R's,"If you are using this machine primarily as a DVD player it is quite user friendly, however it does not have the capablity to play CD-r's or CD-RW's, either PC or music format. It' HDCD decoding, however, is a rare asset."
5,THE SD-2200 IS THE BEST DVD PLAYER I OWN,"I AM NOT GOING INTO ALL OF THE SPECIFICS, BUT OUT OF 9 DVD PLAYERS I OWN, THIS IS MY FAVORITE----THOSE ANNOYING LETTERBOX MOVIES ZOOM INTO STANDARD AT ONE CLICK WITH VERY EQUAL BALANCING ON THE CUTOFF SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A STANDARD MOVIE, YOU DO NOT MISS ANYTHING...IT PLAYED ALL OF MY DVD-R'S AND MY SVCD'S...I WOULD NOT TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING, IN FACT I MAY BUY ANOTHER."
1,Didn't last long,"I had the 2200 lest than 2 hours, and bang freeze up's,than pexls,then nothing.Brought it back ,i""m waiting for my next new one HA"
3,OK Machine,"I've had the Toshiba SD2200 for several months now. I have been pleased with it's overall performance. The sound and picture are great and the features are numerous for this price player, however there are some minor glitchs. It's had a stutter twice in the last month and it does not play multi-level discs. So if you do purchase one make sure the movies you purchase/rent are not multi-level discs or it will not work."
3,"Great DVD player, no CD-R support.","The DVD player itself is great, the picture is excellent, sound is great, supports HDCD (I don't own a single one of them but it's a feature). The downside for me is I have a lot of burned CD mixes from my CD collection and this player won't play any of them. It absolutely does NOT support any compact disc made from CD-R blank media. It's my own fault for not doing my research. I was hoping to replace my regular CD-changer with this player, no such luck. I have to hook up my old 5 disc changer to play burned CD's."
2,Nothing gained,These sockets barely give you 20 degrees bend. I ordered these to get low profile and flexibility and basically got nothing. Then they are too big around to get in anywhere else that I could actually use that 20 degrees. Very disappointed. That's the downside of buying on line.
1,timer on/off dial stopped working after 3 months,"I am very dissapointed in this toaster oven. The timer dial stoped working after 3 months, now the oven will not shut off. The wire racks are tippy as well, causing food to dump out (or in)."
1,Poorly made toaster oven,The toaster oven arrived in terrible condition. The top was scratched up. It appeared to be an item that had been returned after it had been used. Shoddy workmanship.
3,It's OK.,"I was looking to replace my old DeLonghi toaster that had lasted 9 years. I researched and decided to remain loyal to DeLonghi. I saw it in the store and liked the look. It's taller, bigger and is built sturdier than other toaster ovens. I bought this oven for 2 reasons: to toast bagels and cook items. It does a great job of cooking food. I use this when I only have a small amount of food to cook and I don't want to turn on the main oven. This DeLonghi toaster oven does not toast bagels, bread, english muffins, etc. It just warms the bread. If your primary reason is to toast bread - don't buy this toaster. I love the removable crumb tray (something my old DeLonghi didn't have). Be careful when you pull out the rack or the pan because they have a tendency to tip forward towards you. Not the best design. I haven't used the rotisserie yet."
4,"bigger, bettter",much bigger then the toaster oven we replaced.only con i have for this product is that it takes a long time to toast bread.
1,Terrible design,"I received one of these units as a gift and was very excited to use it since it has a rotisserie feature and I love rotisserie chicken. Unfortunately no actually chicken can fit in side and be turned by the spit. If I used only cornish game hens or squab It might work. The chicken, which was only 3.1 lbs, was too ""big"" to turn all the way and this was after I trussed the h*ll out if it. Also, it is almost impossible to insert the rotisserie bar into the unit since the guide rails do not work. It also takes a very very very long time to toast bread. Also, the outside gets extremely hot when in use. I am glad I did not buy this and I can't believe DeLonghi would actually release this product. Use your oven or buy a different brand. Stay away."
1,Died after 1 year,"We purchased this toaster oven as a replacement for a smaller one that we had for 17 years. The older toaster oven didn't even have mechanical problems, but the handle broke off, so it was time. For the short year that it worked, I liked the toaster oven, particularly the convection part. It had some issues, though. Toasting was a problem, because it took too long to toast. Another issue I had was that the top burner was very close to the door, so you had to be very careful when putting things in the oven so you wouldn't get burned. It happened to both my husband and me. Nasty, blistering burns. Forget the rotisserie. I tried a chicken once. Unless it is a tiny game hen, most rotisserie meats will be too big and scrape across the top burner (and burn) or will be too big to even rotate. Now, the biggest issue? IT STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY AFTER A YEAR! Just died in the middle of cooking. Do not buy this toaster oven!"
5,Awesome Oven for Dorm Room!,"I got this oven a few weeks ago, and wow, am I impressed! On top of getting it for a great price, this large size oven comes with a rotisserie, broil pan, a cookie sheet and 2 racks. So far I've used it to bake chicken, a whole large frozen pizza, croissants, and a few other dishes. It's a bit larger than your average toaster oven, but with all it does, I don't mind the extra size since I don't have an actual oven.Only downsides are that like most toaster/countertop ovens the exterior gets hot; and the food near the door doesn't bake/brown at the same rate (I just turned the food midway), but it's not a huge difference anyway.Excellent substitute oven for a door room or small apt!"
1,Glass door exploded!,Delonghi has been the worst company to deal with. Not only did they sell me a hazardous appliance but they will not respond to phone calls or emails regarding warranty. The glass door on this oven exploded while I was cooking chicken nuggets. I only had the oven for 3 months when it exploded. I paid over $80 for it and will never buy another Delonghi product again. I'm just grateful my children were not infront of the oven when the glass exploded or there could have been serious injuries.
2,waist of money,I bought this mainly for toasting but liked the other features too..The toast takes forever to toast..and the timer is so loud..and it didnt even toast good on both sides..very disapointed..
2,NO Rotisserie,"Well unless it got lost in transit, there is no Rotisserie and I do not mean the turn spit. There is no mounts or holes or motor for one. I have gone back and checked and it says ""DeLonghi RO2058 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven with Rotisserie "" for this model, including the DeLonghi site. Its not there...DeLonghi RO2058 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven with Rotisserie"
1,CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS LOUSY! The handle is loose and can't be removed or tightened.,"It is easy to use and works as expected, but is poorly made. The handle is loose and getting looser. It eventually will fall off. I contacted DeLonghi but since it is out of warranty they refused to give any explanation about how to repair it myself. Instead they said I should take it to one of their authorized repair shops.I could have done that on my own, all I wanted was a bit of help from their engineering folks.This is the second DeLonghi toaster oven we purchased. The first quit under warranty. Now this one will soon be unusable.I suggest you purchase another brand that is better made, and a company with adequate customer service. Check reviews before purchasing.I'm done supporting DeLonghi because of poorly made products and inadequate customer support."
4,Really enjoying this product,"We are really enjoying this toaster oven with rotisserie. The only feature I really don't like is that the racks do not pull out when I open the door and then they don't have a stop on them so that they fall out if pulled out just a little too far.The rotisseie has worked beautifully for a whole chicken, a pork loin roast and a turkey breast. Toasting is not as even as a standard toaster, but if you place your bread, english muffin, etc in the positions recommended in the booklet it does a passable job."
5,High quality product. I'll highly recommend it.,"Great product, we tried most functions already and love it.This is our second DeLonghi toaster/oven. First one was still working after seven years, we just wanted an upgrade."
2,Not the old DeLonghi quality,"This was purchased to replace my 12 year old DeLonghi. The shelves are awkward and tilt backward and forward in a dangerous way that can result in burns! Please take care if you order this item as it poses a lot of safety issues. My ?new oven had been previously opened and the interior items were messed inside the oven, so I was really unhappy that it was not really NEW. No responses to correcting this, so I chose to keep it and be very careful when I use it. Takes way to long to heat up also, so you must wait for the elements to cool down enough to keep from burning food.Not a good choice. I haven't used the rotisserie, but it seems too awkward, too. Do your homework and find something you love before ordering it online. I should have been wiser, but I counted on the brand name and am very disappointed. Not safe design."
2,Toaster Oven Review,The toaster oven is good for baking small dishes. It is very poor for toasting. It takes a long time and is not at all equivalent to a regular toaster.The Oster Toaster Oven I had previously was superior in all aspects.
1,DeLonghi RO2058 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven,"Caution: Safety Hazard!While I liked all of the features of this oven it has a significant problem. The guides for the wire rack and bake pan are only at the front and back sides of the oven. Consequently, when you pull the rack out slightly it has a strong tendency to tip forward or backwards which would cause hot liquid to spill back into the oven or forward on the users hands. As much as I like this toaster oven for it's features it's being returned."
2,Disappointing,"Impossible to clean interior and pan as finish comes right off with even light scrubbing. Interior scratched right away just from inserting oven rack. Doesn't have specific temps: you must estimate. Also, when using as toaster per instructions, easy to burn yourself reaching to get toast out of oven. The list of things I dislike about this oven go on. I cannot even imagine using it as a rotisserie! You'd never get it cleaned! And it is not inexpensive. Keep looking!"
2,Burned the daylights out of my hand,"Wanted a largish convection oven to assist for Thanksgiving. One of the extras for me was the rotisserie feature. I seasoned a 2.5 lb pork for my first rotis. experience with this beast and found that the spit did not continue turning consistently. It kind of got stuck/kept slipping out of gear. I branded my hand with the top heating element fiddling with the spit in the middle of my endeavor. I will now have a nice lifelong scar to show for this purchase. If I have time, I am going to return this piece of dreck to Macy's where I purchased it for $99.If, as is often the case with me, this animal ends up with the various other useless or defective appliances I have accumulated and am too lazy to return, I will indulge in the pleasure of bringing it to the local dump on a day off and hurl it into the large metal compactor with extreme prejudice."
1,DeLonghi Convection Toaster,DeLonghi RO2058 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven with RotisserieThe toaster takes twice along as my last Convection Toaster Oven!I had it 4 months abn it completely stopped working!I have to pay the postage to have it repaired and it will take 4-6 weeks!Do not buy this product!
3,Stay in the kitchen while baking,"On the positive side: it looks nice; it's large enough to cook a small pizza. Things I don't like about it include: making toast takes forever; in order to bake something for longer than 12-15 minutes, you have to keep turning the bottom (toast color)knob to keep the oven on. I have had better luck with smaller, less expensive toaster ovens."
2,Stay Away from this Furnace!!,"This is a flimsy product that is made in China. The exterior gets extremely hot, and is a fire hazard. I am giving it two stars because of its multi-functionality, not because of how satisfied I am with the purchase.Before you decide not to buy, I would like to share my two cents about the comments other reviewers made:1) The oven does go to 450F, the last temperature listed on the knob is 390F, however, it does turn past it to ""broil"", which I assume is 450F.I am returning this item back to Amazon!!"
3,very attractive and well built,"bought for my elderly mother for christmas due to good looks and ergonomic knobs; writing still a little to faint for her vision, but better than most. well built, good features.. a couple points that could be better: do not like the fact that cannot stop or adjust toast cycle once starts; must wait for timer to go through cycle. do not like the fact that multiple knobs have to be in certain positions in order to perform each function, e.g., toast or bake. however, with simple instructions I think she will be able to get this right."
3,Toaster oven,"I have been very disappointed in this oven. I had a DeLonghi oven that I bought several years ago and it was a great oven, but the knob wore out and I had to use pliers to turn it off and on. The old oven was so much better and toasted the bread much faster. This one takes a long time to toast bread and is far more flemzy and the rotisserie doesn't have enough power to keep even light weight meat turning. I also had bought a DeLonghi coffee pot and I don't think it is very good quality either. I will never buy another DeLonghi product again."
1,FAULTY PRODUCT,"If I could give ZERO STARS I WOULD! After less than one year the light bulb burnt out, the toaster function stopped working and and on/off knob does not click into place so you could end up mistakenly baking when you mean to be toasting. Customer Service was terrible and told me to ship the product to Pennsylvania (from Illinois) to have it repaired and reminded me that I'm 2 months past my warranty so I would be paying out of pocket! I will NEVER again buy a DeLonghi Product! Spend you $$$ Elsewhere!"
2,I really wanted this to work,"I turned the oven on then was afraid to put it near anything else for fear of a fire. One review said it was cool to the touch, one said it isn't. So I took the chance, and second review was correct, unfortunately. I really wanted this to work, as it has all the features I am looking for."
4,Watch what you wish for,"Give an evil genius a genie and watch out! That's the storyline in this JSA collection. The Ultra-Humanite steals the body of Johnny Thunder and then steals the Thunderbolt from its current master, Jakeem. He then proceeds to remake the world in his own warped image. Only a few remaining heroes (and one villain) are still free to stop him. The Johns/Goyer team does a nice job of bringing back Hourman II, who finally outgrows his father's shadow and leads the team into action. The focus on Wildcat is a nice touch as well, as he personifies the ""tough guy"" superhero, but most welcome of all is the opportunity to see Jakeem be more than ""the angry kid"" character and become a hero. This story really solidifies this version of the JSA as worthy successor to the original."
4,Stealing Thunder,I chose this rating because this is a very good story line which made this a very good read. put together well
5,Great Item that arrived on time,When the book arrived it was in good condition and it was delivered in the time allotted.
3,Gender: Psychological Perspectives (5th Edition),This book was required for one of my classes. It must be good or my professors would not have assigned me to read it. :-)
4,Rite of Spring Review.,"This album is very good. I like Robert Craft on Naxos better but this one is good. the best thing about this recording is that you can hear almost every single note played whereas Rober Craft you have to listen hard for the 12 tones and such.First time I heard this one it sounded different from the Rite of Spring because I could hear so many more notes. none of the dissonance was under played.Classic Telarc sound, Very good Rendition. I have several recordings from Maazel and Pictures is my favorite. this one is up there although it ranks second out of the 4 recordings I have, the two others being less popular, it is still very good and I do highly recommend it to anyone:)"
2,Drivers need work,"I wish I had seen the previous review before I did go and spend 2 hours with this adapter. I installed it on my laptop (after a few calls to netgear tech support) and got it working. When it works, it's great, but half the time my computer boots up and doesn't recognize it's there, and there seems to be no predictor or way of controlling when it will and won't work. Have had a couple of IT people at the office try to figure out what's wrong, they say the driver that came with the product is less than optimal. I have just downloaded the driver off netgear's web site, but it seems to be the same one. Will update my review if the ""new"" driver makes any difference, but for now I can't recommend this product."
5,has worked flawlessly so far WinXP home !,"It has been working without any problems so far on my laptop with Win XP Home. The drivers included on floppy were obsolete, but luckily Win XP had a better version in its database. So no installation was needed for it ! Just plug and play. Although in my opinion this peice shouldn't cost more than [$$$]! The companies making these products are ripping off laptop owners thinking all of these are bought by corporate America, which doesn't care for the price !!Update: I returned this back to Staples. Found another seller on ebay giving me a Belkin one brand new [$$$]with priority shipping. (This confirms my suspicion that this product should cost only around 10 bucks). So guys don't pay 40 bucks for this simple piece of hardware."
2,Know the hidden requirements before you buy!,"I recommend you call Netgear and ask them if you system is compatible with this adapter before you buy. I doesn't work with certain certain chipsets (I think the VIA chipsets -- which are pretty common).My frustration was that I found this information out only after I'd bought the thing.If you're looking for an ethernet adapter for a laptop, I recommend a PCMCIA card; that was my eventual solution. They are more reliable (and faster)."
1,Easy to use solution to network add-ons.,"After initially thinking this to be a God send I soon found it to be straight from HELL. This items works only sparadically at best. I called tech support took 1 hour on hold. Finally technical help said, ""we have had lots of reports of sparadic data flow"". In laymens term, it doesn't work all the time. Software is the issue as data seems to get compacted and lost. Unless they come out with a software upgrade steer away from this."
1,Worthless,"I've experienced the same problems mentioned in the other reviews. In a nutshell, the hardware functions intermittently at best. If you think it's easier to just plug in a USB adapter than install an Ethernet card, do yourself a favor - save the money and buy a quicker and more reliable in-machine card - don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Never sees the network,I updated drivers from the netgear website and it still didnt work. The computer connected to this adaptor could not see the network and the network could not see this computer. It only worked once or twice. By this review i am not saying netgear products are bad because i think they are great it is just this one product that is not up to netgear standards.
2,Make sure you have the updated driver before you install.,"Before you spend 2 hours with this product, check to see where it was manufactured. Look on the back of the product. If it reads ""made in China"". GO GET THE NEWER DRIVER! ...Overall, I love Netgear products. My 2 star rating on this is not final. I am hoping that the new unit installs and operates as it should.I hope that this helps someone.Bob L."
1,Not recommended,Picked this title up for 1 cent thinking that maybe it might have something beneficial to my poker game. Boy was I wrong. Play is painfully slow. The chatter by the other players is totally annoying and painfully repetitive. No information about odds or card statistics is provided. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this title. I bet Howard Lederer doesn't play this junk. My guess is he took the money and ran...really fast and really far away and with his primary involvement being having his photo taken for the front of the box and cashing the check...
3,Works fine,"A great little bag if a great little bag is what you need. Seems durable and zippers tight. I use them for small items like cable adapters, RJ45 loopback plugs, etc."
5,"Simple, but does its job perfectly","I have a set of screwdrivers, a metric socket set, a cable puller, knife, flashlight, two spanners, and two vice grips in this bag with a tiny bit of space to spare, which is fine by me. I toss this all into the glovebox of my scooter, which gets tossed around a fair bit when I hit road bumps, but the bag holds up perfectly fine and opens and closes without a hiccup.Aside from some scuffs of paint and dirt on the bag, it looks exactly the same as when I got it six months ago. Can't really complain with something this simple, but at the same time I once had a cheaper bag that I picked up from a local store, and that thing lasted exactly two days. Screwdriver went right through it, and it didn't even carry as much!"
5,Quality Bag,I purchased this bag to hold my electric fillet knife and blades. It works perfect for this and the bag is constructed of heavy duty material which should last for years.
1,Misleading Title & Cover - The book is an utter bore,"This book has all the right ingredients to make it sound very interesting: rich people, high-finance, Connecticut neighborhoods, privileged kids, infidelity, etc... but there is no real story. You read half the book and nothing has happened..and when it seems like something interesting is going to happen, the author writes 10 pages on the background of the character which delays the action that was just about to take place...This book is a good read if you skip the first 150 pages and then skip every 5 pages..Actually, I take that back, just skip the whole book."
3,"Works as advertised, but....","Works OK until we get a rain. Water gets in somehow and then I must take the sending unit inside for a couple of day until it dry. Then it will start working again, until the next rain."
5,He's Hardcore,This is just an awsome compalation of hardcore matches from the master; Cactus Jack. If you miss Foley pick this disc up and you'll have over three hours of matches and promos. Just an awsome DVD.
3,Before cactus sold out,"I was there for Cactus jacks last match, legendary isnt even the word for him. If your a true fan of Mick, the Mick before he sold out, then you'll love this movie, i know i do."
1,This DVD Sucked!,Yo trust me this thing sucked. Don't listen to these other people for a hardcore legend who fought others. Halfway through this thing and I was asleep. I trusted what these people said and I wasted my money and my time. Sure there is a few good spots but they are so far in the dvd u fall asleep before u see it. I reccommed any thing but this!!!!!!!!!!
4,Basic colorful blocks for baby,"I purchased these blocks for my 8 month old. He loves putting every piece in his mouth, so I appreciated the non toxic paint and the fact that it was not made in China. This brand is manufactured in Germany. The colors are a nice mix of primary colors and the painted blocks are smooth. Some of the plain wood blocks have a rough edge, but with a little rub of sandpaper, they are good as new. This was a big hit."
3,Great product -- price high for small number of blocks,"I love HABA. Love blocks, they're a must for all children. But I was disappointed with the size of the box when it arrived"
5,"If you like the Barber of Seville, you'll love this one!","I was unfamiliar with La Cenerentola until I bought this disk. It's great! It has the same style of rythm and melody in the vocal lines that pervades the Barber and which, to me, makes Rossini great. I'm not usually a huge fan of Cecelia Bartoli, but she does a really nice job in this recording - much less of the harsh glare I often hear in her voice. William Matteuzzi is a great lyric singer as well. I originally bought the disk because he was on it.If you're an audiophile, you will find the recording above par, but the soundstage is a little narrow. I guess I'd give the performance 5 stars and the recording 4 stars."
5,Beautiful!,"Excellent volume of Mac Raboy's beautiful artwork for those of us who struggle to afford the Fawcett originals. The title is a mis-nomer, since it's really all Junior, which is fine with me. I've always been fascinated by a skinny 14 year-old with super powers. The adventures have been covered in other reviews, so I'll content myself with drooling over the art! I can't wait for further volumes."
2,"So-called ""right"" man not quite right","In this book, a group of foreign(non-Chinese) prisoners in communist China are sent to a prison camp where they are to be converted to communists. In many respects this book is well-written and fascinating. I was very interested in the descriptions of the methods by the communists to gain control of China and turn the people into communists as well as descriptions of some of the brainwashing techniques used.However, I was ultimately dissatisfied with the book. The way the women threw themselves at the main character was unbelievable. Also, the analysis of the personality of what is called the ""right"" man or terrorist type seems flawed, particularly the assumption that any terrorist type will succumb to serious illness or death if he is left by his wife."
5,intriguingly sinful,"A short story masterpiece, to say the least. The typical religious hypocricy displayed in the Elwyn stories are humorously accurate. Each character of the book is made so deeply understandable, Preston Allen hits each sinner right on the nail. This book is extremely entertaining, It will suck you in, you wont want the stories to end. You'll want to meet the characters and talk to them; unfortunately, they're all stuck in one brilliant man's head: A man who has perfected the art of short story writing."
4,A sinner is a sinner,Allen illustrates life lessons with a moralistic tilt in his collection of short stories. Many readers will find this book to be an enjoyable read and those new to this genre may be intrigued by his cast of characters. I especially enjoyed the stories that featured the religiously-correct Elwyn; I would take pleasure in a full length novel on his story alone. CHURCHBOYS AND OTHER SINNERS makes a great train ride read. The stories are brief and meaningful and leave the reader satisfied.Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website...
4,Quick Delivery,"I haven't started reading the book yet, but it comes HIGHLY recommended by a trusted friend of mine who places a high priority on prayer and intercession. I look forward to finding more information about this essential area. The delivery time was good, I was pleased with their service."
5,Intimacy with God,"This book radically changed my perception of who I was to Jesus. I would pray, but not in confidence or authority and my prayer life suffered because of it. However, this book showed me my (undeserved) authority and gave me confidence in His presence that has overflowed into all areas of my life."
5,Perfecto!,Well the past 5 previous books were unbelieablely awesome!The whole story gets you sucked into it.I love the thrill and the plot...characters were all perfectly made.Action is interesting.I'd recommend the whole thing...all 13 books for the adult side of the story and the 40 books for the kids side of the story.
4,Fluid Borders,This is a great book about the borders and boundaries drawn between Latina/os as a result of the proposition 187. The interviews and the case studies illustrate the complexity that Latina/os are not a monolithic group.
1,"wonderfull movies, overpriced.","While I enjoy both these movies I would never pay over $100 for a two pack of them when I can get black mask for under &10 and the lost empire for under $14. Just because they are no longer packaged as a two movie special (done to get people to watch the lost empire for a discounted price when they bought a jet lee film) does not mean they are a collectible. This is outright overcharging for a product. The two movie pack was ment as a discount special, not a limited edition."
5,Kids love this book.,This book really got alot of my second graders more excited about reading. It is a great choice!
3,Cute to Read for Older Readers,"You Read to Me, I'll Read to You is based upon a very cute idea. The entire book is a variation of a play for two people. The author's note at the beginning suggests that the one part be read by an advanced reader and the other be read by a beginner. The actual stories within the book, however, may be too difficult for a beginning reader. Since the stories are based on familiar fairy tales and are accompanied by many colorful cartoon drawings, it may aid slightly in beginning readers. However, the fairy tales all end with everyone becoming friends and getting along, which is great to teach to children, but may confusing to younger kids since it does change the way the some of the stories end."
4,Kids love it,My 8 year old loves these books and reads them all the time. We had to get them all because mom and dad needed a change! Honestly they put me to sleep but little girl loves them and they make her want to read so I guess a job well done !
4,Helped with fluency,I bought this book to read with my 7 year old who is having a bit of trouble reading with fluency. She loves it and we are reading together!
5,a wonderful book,"I love this book. When I leave it out on the shelf in the classroom, the kids actually ask to read it. They love reading to each other. Perfect for bilinguals or kids just starting out.My own kids and I can still recite parts of it from memory (""I found a dime! You found a dime? I found a dime at dinnertime!"") The illustrations are adorable and are entertaining all on their own. Buy it and share!"
5,I wish I'd thought of this first!,"As a teacher who regularly works with struggling readers, I find this interactive format of benefit to beginning readers, and a great way to snuggle with a favorite child. I highly recommend all of the books in the ""You Read to Me, I'll Read to You"" series by Hoberman and Emberley."
2,"Watery formula, floppy applicator","One of the beauty gurus that I watch on youtube just raved about this product. I was running out of my regular black liquid eyeliner, so I decided to give this a try. I had been thinking about picking up the Lancome ArtLiner and this product was specifically mentioned as being a near exact dupe for that product.I am not happy with this product. I think the formula is incredibly watery. People raved about how intensely pigmented it is ... well, not the one I have. It applies very inconsistently. I make sure to give the product a vigorous shaking to make sure it is well mixed, but it doesn't seem to make any different, it's still watery.The applicator is a long, thin felt tip. It's like an awful mix of felt tip and a brush, getting the worst of both worlds.I will not be repurchasing."
2,Not as intense,"I was hoping it would be a sharp dark line, but the ink tends to blend too easily with my skin tone."
5,"Best ever, but discontinued, so sad!",This product and color is the best but has been discontinued by L'oreal. So sad when that happens. Have to look real hard for it but worth it.
2,Terrible,First of all product didn't come in original package. Secondly liquid was soooooo watery it did not live to the word carbon black more like transparent black. Horrible. Made me think this product was used because it didn't come in original package.
3,eyeliner,I. like it but I do not like the brush I thought it would easier to use. I would buy it again if it comes out with a differentPen brush
2,Naah!!,"My favorite liner is one from Revlon. It manages to stay put on my eyes without straying away in all directions.And then, MAC has a couple of good ones.I wanted this one since I thought it'd be much easier to apply. Well it isn't. I am very very familiar with applying liners and these definitely need time.Given the time, the effect is decent.The first application is almost faint and shows skin. I need to fill that in repeatedly to get the desired effect. And well, it starts to fade after a short while on my skin.And just a few months of rare applications and it is already getting over.Not happy with the quantity, quality or price.The 2 stars is because of the pros - I felt that the product is not harsh - no irritation, redness etcIf you take the effort to apply it, it looks good.Color - The darker it is, the better I like them. This one's not too bad in the color department."
5,Amazing!,"I have had a lot of trouble with various brands of liquid liner somehow smearing a line onto the area above my eyelid while I'm at work. I got into the habit of constanty rubbing the area a few times an hour to remove the embarrising line. I had tried many different brands, waterproof also, and still the same thing happened or they were just a pain to put on and look decent. I love this eyeliner so much! It stays on all day, doesn't smear above my eyelid no matter how much I sweat, and the felt tip makes it so easy to put on and look good! It's cheap, available at drug stores, and comes off easy with some makeup remover."
4,Excellent brush,"I usually have trouble with liquid liners because of the brush it uses. This one is thick, short and very sturdy. It didn't waver an centimeter while I was lining my upper eye. I only gave it four starts because the price is a little high for such a small bottle of liner."
5,Suz,"Thos is a product I have a hard time finding in stores, but am able to find at Amazon. I like how easy this eyeliner is to apply. It is fast drying and long wearing. I like the color."
2,Eye Liner,Not the best of Liners. (Amit's Wife). I've used other liners and was kinda disappointed with this one. Also when it arrived it leaked from the manufacturing package.
2,It's Very Light...,"This is quite easy to apply, and for that I gave it two stars. But other than that aspect, it really isn't fantastic. I used it twice and was very happy, but after just two applications, the liquid was completely gone. It doesn't even work anymore, it is just a felt tip with nothing on it.I wouldn't recommend it unless you know of some way to make it last longer..."
4,Easy to apply eyeliner,"This eyeliner is easy to apply, but I wish it was water proof. It can smudge so you may need to remove some of it that goes on your crease, but for the price, I like it."
3,Average quality,A small amount of the nuts were rotten but believe it or not this is not uncommon. I have been looking for any non Planters or other high profile brand nuts that have absolutely no rotten nuts but have yet to find one.
2,Poor quality/hard to see screen,"I bought this for my dad. It looked stylish, had a light, etc. Once it came I realized the screen was very pale, and it made it extremely hard to read. In order to navigate you had to move in a grid, you couldn't just point to a square. The game also made noise independently, without being in use, and while OFF. I ended up returning it to the store.I give it a two, because it has nice options for levels, and a simple to use design."
4,Great CD,"This is a wonderful recording of classical music that is perfect for young kids, and the actors who narrate along with it are ideal storytellers! I heard this version of ""Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra"" with Sean Connery years ago, and was so happy to find a copy of it!"
4,Gift for Dad,"I ordered this CD for my Dad right before Christmas and suprisingly it arrived before Christmas! Unfortunately, it did not have the song he wanted. However, he was still happy with his new CD! Will purchase from this seller again. Very happy with the transaction."
5,Tales from the Crypt,These are Christmas gifts for my daughter. I received them quickly and in great shape. I look forward to watching them myself.
4,Memory Lane,"Boy, does this series bring back memories. I use to watch this show as a kid. I think I even enjoy it more now. Love it."
5,Ben's Trumpet,"Ben's Trumpet (authored and illustrated by Rachel Isadora) was named a Caldecott Honor book for best illustrations in 1980. Honor! These black and white pics are striking! I'll have to read the book that actually won that year. I can't imagine anything better than ""Ben"". But that's beside the point.SummaryBen has an imaginary trumpet and frequents the outside of the Zig Zag Jazz Club. He plays his ""trumpet"" for his mother, father, grandmother, and baby sister. But when neighborhood children see him playing, they laugh and call him crazy. Ben decides to quit playing his imaginary trumpet, until he meets with the trumpeter from the club.Ben's Trumpet is a masterful with a simple text and ""art-deco"" that is remeniscent of The Jazz Era. Isadora is successful in conveying a cool, jazzy feel. A must-read with a satisfying conclusion. Play on!R"
4,"Superb illustrations; the story is touching and cute, but shallow","Ben's loves jazz music. He loves the trumpet. He spends much of his free time listening to the band at the Zig Zag Jazz Club or playing himself.The only problem is, he doesn't have a trumpet. He practices the brass equivalent of ""air trumpet.""Some people ignore him, some praise him, and some just laugh. What will happen?The story line in Ben's trumpet is not complicated. In fact, if you just read the story to someone, and prevent them from seeing the pictures, the story comes off as cute but shallow.But the superb illustrations by Rachel Isadora make this a great children's book. Her pen and ink drawings of gritty neighborhoods, people with expressive faces, and ""the world as seen by Ben,"" make this an effective story to read to children.This is a review of the 1989 Scholastic edition. The story was copyrighted in 1979."
2,Predictable And Not Particularly Well-Written!,"As evidenced by my title for this review, I didn't care for Critical Mass. As a matter of fact. I'm being generous giving it a 2-star rating. I decided to read Critical Mass because I was given it and 9 other books by Hagberg by my brother; now I have to decide if I want to invest more of my time reading this author. In my opinion, Hagberg's premise for Critical Mass was interesting, but his character development in general is weak and his main character -- CIA assassin and top agent, Kirk McCarvey, comes across more like a cartoon-like action figure than a real person. Further, Hagberg's narrative style and ability to create dialog that people would actuall speak leaves a lot to be desired. If this isn't enough to convince you to bypass this book, the action sequences, while numerous, are mostly predictable and not very exciting. I'm not usually this critical about someone's work, but Critical Mass was, to me, a crtical mess."
5,The Lincoln Rhyme Sagas Continue....Worthwhile Read,"Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs are back in this spine-chilling novel. A famed criminologist paralyzed from the neck down, Lincoln compensates for his disability with his brains-and the arms and legs of his beautiful Ameila Sachs, who ""walka the grid"" for him.Now in this story, Lincoln and Amelia manage to track down a cargo ship headed for New York City and carrying two dozen illegal Chinese immigrants, as well as the notorious human smuggler known as the ""ghost."" But when the ghost's capture goes all wrong, Lincoln and Amelia find themselves in a race against time; to stop the Ghost before he can track down and murder the two surviving families who have escaped from the ship and vanished deep into the world of New York City's Chinatown.I found the book interesting and worhwhile reading."
3,Not as good as The Blue Nowhere,"This book is okay. It is not brilliant though. It is about illegal Chinese immigrants who miraculously survive the scuttling of their refugee boat by their snakehead called the Ghost. Not being a nice guy the snakehead spends the duration of this novel trying to track them down and kill them in the streets of New York. Meanwhile agents Rhyme and Sachs try to also find the illegals and stop the murderous rampage of the Ghost.This book does give an insight into what it is like to be an illegal refugee and what it must be like to come from a poor country and see both the superior lifestyle as well as the wastage of the new country. It also shows the resentment of family members to their parents who bring them there for a better life when things are not working out. It is not a bad novel but nothing real exciting ever develops. I have read The Blue Nowhere by Deaver, which is sensational. Check that one out. There are better books than this one though."
4,RHYME IS CHASING THE GHOST THIS TIME,Chinese people save money to TheGhost to smuggle them into America but are lefy to drown when the ship is about to be intercepted by the Coast Guard. The Ghost survives and is determined to kill any survivorswho can testify against him. New York's Chinatown hides a lot of people who know secrets Rhyme wants answers to. With his skillful deductions Rhyme and Sacks are led thru twisting and unexpected turns raising the suspense level to the highest. It becomes a page turner as the reader tries to keep up with the unusual events. A good read to keep your interest high. Sad insights as to the plight of the Asians seeking refuge in America.
3,Has Its Ups and Downs..,"Deaver seems to be targeting the movie rights for this book - this work seems to be specifically written with a movie in mind... not that a movie on the same wouldn't be interesting, though!Extremely fast-paced, the book provides informative insight into Chinese society without sounding patronizing. Lincoln Rhyme's deductions are amazing as usual although Amelia Sachs steals a bit too much of the thunder in this book, compared to the others in the series, no complaints on that count anyway..Overall, the plot, involving Rhyme/Sachs and the agency's hunt for a dreaded Chinese human-trafficker, has its ups and downs but remains quite entertaining all the same - worth a read, but dont think, a second."
4,Not disappointed,I have always enjoyed Jeffery Deavers stories. I was not disappointed with this one either.
3,3 Stars for plot 0 for character development,"I have greatly enjoyed Deaver's Rhyme novels since Bone Collector. The pacing and storylines are always fascinating and Stone Monkey is no different. I had a fun time following the story through the twists and turns that Deaver weaves so deftly into his books.The sticking point that keeps Stone Monkey at 3 stars and not 5 is the lack of character development. Deaver introduced us to a cast of fascinating people in Bone Collector and it's a reader's investment in those characters that have kept me coming back to his other 3 Rhyme novels. Yet for some reason Deaver seems to feel a need to interject new characters into his stories, rather then expand on the ones he's already hooked his readers with.Beyond that lack, Stone Monkey was a very enjoyable and gripping read and I do recomend it to veteran Deaver fans."
1,Boring....,"I've read the previous books in this series and enjoyed them immensely; however, I simply could not get into this book. I'm not sure why but I had to force myself to read the first 50 pages and then after that I just gave up. I love reading too much to make myself continue to read a novel I'm not enjoying. The writing was fine and the characters were ok... I simply could not get into the story. I've skipped this book and am now reading the next in the series the Vanishing Man and am devouring it!"
3,Good try but .....,"Deaver has tried to put some Chinese traditions and stories into his fiction. Being a Chinese, I can tell you some of them are right but some are not.So don't pretend you know and quote those Chinese words and traditions."
1,A no-go novel for me,"This is the third Jeffery Deaver novel I have tried to read. I liked ""Cold Moon"" and I tolerated ""Vanished Man"" although I ultimately gave it away after reading it. First clue that I don't like a book, I give it away. I had the book ""Stone Monkey"" in my reading bag for 3 whole weeks and I never got past past 100. Totally boring and terribly uninteresting. I had other books waiting to be read and I just gave up on this one and gave it away as well. I will not try to read another Lincoln Rhyme novel, I'm done. I started a Harlan Coben novel yesterday and have already finished it. That is what I call the sign of a good book, you just simply can't put it down."
3,An Entertaining Read.,"I have always been a loyal fan of Jeffery Deaver, but his latest piece fell a little short of my incredibly high expectations. The Stone Monkey is the fourth Lincoln Rhyme novel, and it doesn't live up to the high standard it's predessessors had set.The novel is about a human smuggler known as the 'ghost', who while sneaking a few families into the big apple run into trouble from none other than the hero we've all come to know and love, Lincoln Rhyme, and his beautiful sidekick Amelia Sacks (note: they changed the surname in The Bone Collector Movie). After these immigrant flee from his grasp, the ghost being the meanie he is decides to kill em all before they can expose his vast operations.The novel avoided those big plot twists that I found rather disappointing, and although still a good novel, it's nowhere near the quality of Deaver's other books, but overall it's a decent read and should provide you with a good days entertainment."
4,GOOD READ,"i am a big fan of Deaver's work. this book is no exception. although this book seems different than Deaver's past books, i still found it quite enjoyable. a PAGE-TURNER. this novel did not have the usual ""multi-surprise"" ending, but it does give you something that the others have not... Rhyme opens himself up and finds friendship (other than sachs and thom).i also became engrossed with the chinese culture. Deaver does a great job examining the sub-culture of New York's China town.i found the characters very likable, and when i finished reading the book, i couldnt help but wish it was much longer.i cant wait for Deaver's next one!!!!"
2,disappointing,"I stopped reading after 420 pages. Why?Deaver just has to bring up to many impossibilities to keep his story moving.First: an illegal immigrant who steals a truck and drives into NY to China town, without getting lost?? Come on.Second: going back to the ship to find more clues an find some one alive?? We get a crash course scuba diving on top. What is the use for the story?And what is this with the relation between Rhyme and Sachs?Badly drawn characters, bad setting mixed with some orientalism.No thanks. I`ll go back to Conelly, Cohen and Pelecanos.Don`t waste your time on this one."
4,THE STONE MONKEY,"T his is about people smuggling, and in particular one manH e's Chinese, wanted for murder, and approaching America on a tin canE lusive as his name suggests, he's known to all as The GhostS o Lincoln Rhyme is brought on the case because he's cleverer than most.T rying to track him down requires all his forensic skillO nly, The Ghost is hanging around and he's continuing to kill.N ormally when working a case, the focus is on RhymeE xternal characters are used, adding greater interest this time.M ain extra characters are Sonny Li, plus the immigrant family getting away,O ne thing on their minds, fade into obscurity, try not to become The Ghost's prey.N othing seems to faze Lincoln as he tracks down every leadK eeping emotions well in check, you're pretty sure he's gonna succeed.E xcellent thriller again from Deaver, it's a category he's leadingY ear in and year out, his books prove top notch reading"
2,Well-researched but characters are shallow,"Why doesn't this author just write non-fiction? His facts are interesting and he obviously does his homework. However, his characters seem contrived to fit the framework of the plot, rather than driving the plot itself. A good thriller is akin to an exciting biography. That's the genius behind works by people like Lawrence Block. Unfortunately, Deaver's books read like term papers -- good term papers, but dry nonetheless.I left this book feeling that I wasn't so much drawn into the story as informed about an interesting subject. Not time wasted, but not that entertaining, either. Depends what you are looking for, I guess."
3,Not As Good As the Others,I am a huge Jeffrey Deaver's fan and I was a little dissapointed with this book. Lincoln Rhymes and Sachs take a back seat to these new characters. What happened to the blooming romance/relationship between Lincoln and Amelia? The details of death and the trail of the killer where no where near the depth of The Coffin Dancer or Devil's Teardrop. Read the others first - you will love them.
1,It just tastes bad,"The first two Lincoln Rhyme novels were engaging and seemed written on solid ground, but this latest of Deaver's attempts is flakey at best.The inconsistencies and just plain ""suspend your disbelief"" factor throughout the book make it childish and very disappointing to anyone who reads a lot and lives in the real world.Where has Deaver lived all his life, one has to wonder, that he knows so little of basic reality. The actions and behavior of his characters is so out of kilter as to make your stomach ache. Deaver's characters are a bit too vardboard cutout and he moves them around to suit his plot instead of creatively letting the characters drive the story. Perhaps his agent or editor or Deaver himself is too enamored of the Hollywood screenplay money to write an effective novel anymore. It happens all too often. I have to say ""Not even a good try, Mr. Deaver."""
3,Clutter,"One of my favourite mystery writers, but...This time Jeffrey got a little bogged down with Chinese culture (and criminals) - although his friendship with Li was very touching. Very suspenseful, but a little tough going at times."
4,Vintage Deaver,I really enjoyed The Stone Monkey. Great twist. vintage Jeffery Deaver. I can't wait to read the next in the series.
5,SUSPENSE AND ACTION FROM START TO FINISH,"This is my favourite Lincoln Rhyme novel to date and written in much the same style as James Patterson's novels. The author takes us through a maze of twists and turns, murder and mayhem. When two immigrant families are murdered, Deaver takes us in pursuit of ""The Ghost"" (the scheming and calculating villain) and into a criminal investigation deep in the heart of Manhattan's Chinatown. The author vividly portrays Chinese culture and develops strong characters who instantly come to life as the pages turn. The plot is liberally sprinkled with forensic criminology and the thrill of the chase is on. There is plenty of drama, suspense and action to keep the reader shuddering in anticipation well into the late hours of the night. This is Jeffery Deaver at his finest and the novel would make a breath-taking film production!"
3,Steady thriller,This book had many of the twists and turns Deaver is known for. It moved at a steady pace and didn't completely overwhelm the reader with over the top research. There wasn't a lot of character development but Lincoln and Co. stayed true enough to be accessible to readers who pick up the series here.
3,a good read loaded with information,"Jeffery Deaver does a lot of research for these novels likeThe Blue Nowhere: A Novel.He still got Chinese that had a Charlie Chan fortune cookie feel to them?His Chinese are very like characterizations of Italian Catholics by protestants?Although he tries to get into the pagan mind of his Chinese snakeheadsmuggler, the failure is that the result isn'tbelievable to me? Catholics have their saints and the Chinese have their lessor Gods,but sometimes the result is a lot like carrying a rabbit's foot for luck?The modern Chinese are very modern and very rational.I liked the effort to get inside Chinese heads here, anyway;I picked up at least 3 Chinese curse words in this book.The crime-scene investigator theme is an interesting modern approach to detective stories too."
2,The Stone Monkey,"I bought this book for myself and my grandson who was overseas, we both love Deaver's writing, The Stone Monkey left a lot to be desired. My grandson wrote me, Grandma I just can't get anywhere with this book, I felt the same, I had no feeling for the people involved. Deaver's books I usally can't put down once I start reading them, this book I had a hard picking it back up, I did finish it. At work we all read Deaver's books I told them not to waste their time with this one. It is nothing like the Empty Chair, or Maiden's Grave which keep you on the edge of your seat while reading. Sorry"
5,Great Service,"I received the Stone Monkey a Hardcover book on 7/3/08. The book looked new, it is in very good shape. I have not read it yet. But I was very happy with the service I received."
2,Be Careful when reading the reviews,"Reviewer Brenda Kkaras commented that the Seasons DVD had a lot of ""repeating"" scenery and then noted the the Tibet section was ok. Well, there's no Tibet section on this DVD. She must be reviewing a different DVD or perhaps Amazon has linked this review to the wrong product."
2,So disappointed,I expected good music and pretty good scenery. Well the music was okay and the scenery was repeated too often from one dvd to the next. I wouldn't buy them agein. I liked the tibet one. The others weren't terrible just not very good either.
5,Essential for HOT backdoor action!,"If your lady likes it up the wazoo from time to time, you need this product. She'll never know what hit her as you easily ram it home."
2,This film is a cure for insomniacs.,"Ray Bolger works in a very small office. Somehow the invitation meant for celebrity, Ethel Barrymore gets sent to a blonde chorus girl in New York (played by Doris Day). So Ray Bolger must fly to New York as quickly as possible to straighten out this mess. Doris truly believes that as the letter states, the government wants her to represent the American theater at an Arts exposition in Paris, France. Well, Bolger goes to New York and tells her the foul-up. Disappointing indeed. But Wait! This is a Doris Day movie and something good is bound to happen. Doris Day movies always have a happy ending.This film is a cure for insomniacs. Fluff up your pillow. You will get tired."
2,Predictable and unmemorable,"Ethel Barrymore gets mixed up with Ethel Jackson the singer to go to Paris on a major publicity tour and to achieve world fame. Sounds moronic? Practically nothing works in this stale, uneven musical with a forgettable score."
2,Large disappointment,"Showgirl is mistakenly taken to Paris to perform for diplomatic relations, accompanied by Bolger. Wanna guess the ending? Everything from the songs to the plot are unconvincing and so very predictable. Not to be seen twice."
5,Very Good!,"Ceres is a very good anime, as good or better than Fushigi Yugi, though that is only my opinion. I know many people loved Fushigi Yugi (as did I) and like it better than Ceres. Ceres is a different style than Fushigi Yugi, and takes place right in Japan. I think the story line is a little more direct, and personaly I like Aya's personality a little better than Miyaka's. Both animes are very good and are worth the cash!"
1,The Man OF My Life .......... Nada Que Ver!!!!!!!,"I had been curious about purchasing ""The Man of My Life"" reading all the viewer reviews etc. Finally after reading all the reviews, most of which are 5*, I gave in and bought it. This past weekend I invited 4 of my closest gay friends to Movie night claiming we were going to watch a great gay film. Wow! we were so disappointed ... I mean the film is long and boring not to mention the viewer never gets to see why the couple is having intimacy problems other than Fred's ED and we never get to see why Fred considers Hugo the man of his life. Nothing ever happens between the two. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is impressive and beautiful, however the story line leaves much to be desired. NADA QUE VER!!!!!"
4,"Beautiful, but a bit slow at times","I think the movie is beautiful, but it sometimes got lost in that beauty. The cinematography, while, beautiful, makes the movie drag a bit.You know, Fred's character was beautifully played. As a gay man, I'm usually rooting for the man to leave the wife and find his true self -- the one he probably locked away because of responsibility -- but in this movie, I truly felt the pain the wife goes through. In all the ""gay"" movies I've watched, this is the first time I've felt that pain. And it made me cry.One of the things I like about French movies is representation of real people and part of that representation is of their bodies. I never felt like the nudity was gratuitous. It was integrated into the lives of the characters and it made them more real to me.Overall, I think this movie is great. The ending was dramatic, but in a subdued way. But if you are the kind of movie goer who likes action, even some action, then this movie might be a little slow for you."
2,$100 Hamburger,"The Book is of value to aviation buffs who like to get out and fly and stop for a bite. The problem is it was published in 1998 and since then there have been changes. It would be nice to be able to get updates on it since many people, once they have read it, probably could give some advise of other restaraunts or bed and breakfasts. The book does give a web site that is not available. It makes for disappointment when trying to get an update for a book that is not exactly cheap and is 2 years old."
3,The $100 Hamburger,"This book, although helpful ; does not have up to date information. Many of the resturants and small airports listed in the book, no longer can be found. This is very frustrating to the small plane pilot who took a day's trip just to eat at a particular place or to land at a small airport for fuel , only to discover it is no longer there."
1,Ryan Dobson,"This book is full of lies! When I met him on the Kutless tour, he seemed nothing like what his book protrays him to be. He acts all holy in the book and in person, I could tell him from satan apart."
4,Good Book But Comes Across As A Little Rude Or Mean,It's a good book but it comes across as a little rude or mean. I was hesitant to buy the book at first because of the title and the cover. Then I read the back cover and decided to buy it. I was pleasantly surprised. I like the message of the book but take it with a grain of salt.
1,The Special Olympics of Ethics,"I perused this book in a local store yesterday, and could not believe how dreadful it is. Mr. Dobson thinks if he repeats his dull thesis (moral relativism = bad) ten times per page that the reader will be hypnotized into swallowing it without question. Forging a balanced, logical argument is not Dobson's strong point. The kindergarten examples in this text are revolting to anyone with a higher dendrite density than Mr. Forrest Gump.It's quite clear that Mr. Dobson has never studied real philosophy, or perhaps he daydreamed about motorcycles, surfing, and Jesus during the lectures. Anyone who cares to thoughtfully study ethics should read the classic works of Aristotle and Plato. These texts are challenging and have to be read several times, but the intellectual rewards are much worth the effort."
1,the author sounds like Jerry Falwell Jr.,"my, my, my - this book is like jerry falwell junior. i don't know ryan, but i can only imagine he had a very protective, christian-sub-culture immersed, attend a christian college background - as he certainly does not know the realities of being a missional christian in today's culture. if he did, he wouldn't be so horribly scared and bashing people and instead be wise and loving and still hold to Jesus and His teachings, and believe in the inspired Bible - but demonstrate maturity, love and not be so sensationalistic. the whole ""absolute truth"" argument is so silly anyway, since even hardcore postmoderns don't believe EVERYTHING is relative. the argument is so weak, and a book like this only encourages fear and it is preaching to choir who applauds something like this."
1,absolutism based on soft reasoning,"I have to admit I too am intolerant. I have no tolerance for people who think the earth is flat or that gravity is caused by tiny invisible fairies that drag things down or that the earth is 6,000 years old. But as much as such astoundingly illogical thinking pangs me, i don't try to pass laws to keep people who hold those beliefs from holding them or (even worse) passing them to their children.Ironically it is the right wing evangelical Christians who whine about intolerance of their own unproven and probably unprovable subjective beliefs and simultaneously think they should be writing laws to truncate the rights of others. If that isn't hypocrisy I don't know what other word you could use to describe it.Anyway,the book itself, I kept asking myself how this ""man"" got a book published. There isn't a single degree of adult thought or perspective involved. I could imagine i was reading a reorganized teen diary."
1,Intollerant of other people's problems,"I have to agree with Dobsons premise that God is forgiving but not tolerant of sin. But example gives credibility and his own failed marriage is but another example of ""whatever"". Of course he is faultless and it was all her problem...as usual.Edward"
1,Keep Surfin the Sewage Bro,"Daddy's fundamentalists beliefs obviously did a number on this one. I bet the Focus on the Family bible beatings created the tattoo rebellion and then he grew up to realize, ""Gee, I'm just like the old blowhard."" The beaches of orange county contain sewage and I guess every time he gets a little poo in his mouth, its a little reward for his good deeds."
1,turn um away!,if you want to turn people away from christianity get them this book. its horrible. clearly shows why the whole movement of christian intolerance is wrong and full of hypocrisy.
1,A Self-help guide to Hatred,"By the author's own standards, this book clearly deserves extra helpings of intolerance. This book is immature, naive, arrogant, ignorant and shallow-minded vitriol, and I can only hope that this kid will be ashamed of it when he matures, if such event ever occurs.If you haven't guessed yet, I clearly would not recommend this book to anyone ever, but I would like to offer a recommendation to this fellow before he condescends to waste more paper; read the New Testament and stop spending all of your time kicking lepers. He's clearly focused on excavating the most dark and forboding depths of the Old Testament and I would hope that if he really sees himself as a Christian, he might break away from some of the shocking pettiness that spews forth in this book and show just a hint of the teachings of Christ. They are compelling for, among many other reasons, all of the reasons this book is not."
4,Good read,"I picked up this book in a book store and read the first couple of pages, I liked the guy and judging by the few pages I read it sounded like a good book. I was right. This guy made me open my eyes a bit and the book was easy to read, however,I'm pretty sure this book is for people who have been christians for a while. I wouldnt recommend this book to new believers. If you've been a christian for a while like me I recommend this book for you."
1,Some things are just stupid...,"Unfortunately, I doubt the author grasps the irony present in the title of this book. It's not worth the paper it was printed on. I love books, but I can honestly say I wouldn't mind burning this one."
3,A Decent Introduction,"This book serves as a decent introduction to the topic of moral relativism and offers steps to take to stand against it. Is it a little harsh in tone? Yes. But, in this particular case, I think that this harshness might just be necessary. The TUMOR is definately taking hold of our culture, and we do need to follow the advice that Dobson gives."
5,Be Intolerant : Because Some Things Are Just Stupid,"This is probably one of the best reads I have had this year. This book hits the nail on the head about trying to balance life on a wire. The truth to the matter is you really need to pick which side you are going to be on, then stand up for what you believe. Way to go Ryan, you have shown me that it is ok to stand and fight for what is right. I pray that Amazon.com and others will continue to support you getting this and other messages to the general public. It is time for someone at Amazon.com to read your book and pick a side of the fence!"
5,Moral Relativism Sucks,"As a young christian I would definitely recommend this book. I used to think that being a christian meant being nice and not really telling people that what they were doing is wrong because I didn't want to be judgmental, but I was wrong. From now on I am going to let people know that the sins they are committing are wrong, with love. Being intolerant isn't being hurtful, it is giving someone else the chance to learn what God says is right or wrong."
2,Really American,"I read this book in order to participate in a book club discussion online with American Christian Women. They all loved it, but I was unconvinced. While Ryan has many good points, those points are made by focussing on things that Australian wouldn't see as a problem. For example, environmental groups. Maybe we just don't have any raving fanatical environmentalists down under because I thought that taking care of the environment was good and we do need some people to give us a kick up the bum to spur us into action.His writing style was very late childhood/early teenager and I didn't appreciate that. His culture came through too much and the book itself was rather political - and I REALLY didn't appreciate that.Maybe you crazy Americans will like it, but I will not endorse it to any of my Aussie friends. Good points, bad structure and wrapping."
1,Reappropriation,"I just bought this book from the discount bin at Goodwill for fifteen cents. I think I was overcharged. I plan on making poetry out of it using the cut-up technique, which involves physically hacking it to pieces and then reassembling it into something of value. I figured I would take something hateful and evil and turn it into something good. Hint, to all the Ryan Dobsons of the world: That's how you live like Christ. Hey! Get a clue."
1,More cultural than religious,This book reflects conservative Christian culture more than it does Christianity as a religion. Ryan is cherry picking Scripture and interpreting it selectively to suit the cultural values of one subgroup of Christian folk. It's a very validating book if you're into the Focus on the Family culture (e.g. homosexuality is a sin and thats the end of the conversation) but off putting if you're a more progressive Christian.
2,"Ok, not great...","I was a little disappointed with this book. I was expecting a scholarly history, biographies of the inventors, inside stories, tales of invention and rivalry, etc... But the book really belongs more on a coffee table. There is an interesting, not-too-in depth essay at the beginning talking about the history and origins of the ""Novelty Movement"", but the rest of the book is dedicated to a picture dictionary with explanations and blurbs that are sometimes interesting, but not horribly informative. Whats in the Mystery Bag?? They never tell you! Frustrating purchase..."
1,Worst All-In-One Ever,"I purchased this machine in August along with an overnight replacement warranty (thank goodness). Since August I have had 3 different machines. Each one malfunctioned. (1) The automatic feeder did not work properly and the paper jammed. HP replaced the machine. (2) The print head connection was not making contact and the machine would not detect the print cartridges. HP replaced that machine. (3) It would only print in red and blue because the print cartridges were improperly distribting the ink. In addition, each time I replaced the machine I had to uninstall and reinstall the software, which should not have been necessary. Not to mention the hours spent on the phone with HP service and my IT person trying to get the machines to function properly. In one week I had two replacements. It is also noisy and slow. I begged my salesperson to take it back, which he did and I was happy to see it go."
2,Don't buy it if you have more sophisticated graphics needs,"Here's what's good about this machine: easy to set up, legal-sized flatbed scanner, nice LCD display, great fax operation.Here's what's not so good: not actually that fast, verrrrry noisy and can shake your entire desk, and, most importantly, the scanner is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ADOBE PHOTOSHOP. If you use this program, this scanner is completely useless. I wish I'd known that before I bought it and set it up. Luckily, the store I bought it from had a 14 day return policy. I am now happily using a Canon Multipass MP730 (same price) with much better results, including much better printing quality."
1,Do Not Buy!,"This machine was issued to me by my company for use at home. I wish I could take it back, but unfortunately I have no choice.first, this printer uses A LOT of ink. It also shakes wildly when it prints - almost I would invision a cartoon printer to print.The fax machine has no quickscan feature and the autofeeder has to be babysat each and every fax.The scanner is alright, but the software is not too user friendly.Allaround, there are much better products out there. If your company doesn't decide for you, stay away from this one!"
1,don't buy this,fter less than one year the copy function of this printer stopped working. When trying to copy we get a scanner error message. We tried to contact HP about the problem but were 4 days out of warrenty. After several minutes with an online rep we were finally told that they would give us a 15% discount on a new one. Our print repair center told us that if the printer was not on warrenty they could not even order parts for it and it was expected to be disposable. We are disgusted by the company policy. We refuse to by another HP product. Stay away from this item and this company.
1,People who send junk FAX love this machine,"If you leave this machine unattended for a few days, you might come back to find that the memory is loaded with unwanted, junk FAXes that can ONLY be deleted by printing them. Hitting the stop button or even unplugging the machine will NOT erase the memory. In the day and age when junk FAXes are so prolific, one would think HP would have the foresight to offer a solution. (Keeping the machine connected to a computer and previewing every FAX is not a reasonable solution.)"
3,Not for Windows Server 2003,"As Technology Coordinator in a small office, I chose this machine when our OfficeJet R80 began to malfunction. The 7110 has good print quality and its quick speed makes the shaking excusable. We did have some pretty serious FAX errors that required quite a bit of phone time to correct. The documentation concerning error messages is poor, at best. Finally, though this won't be a problem for most people, we have it hooked to a machine running Windows Server 2003 and (as of this writing) HP still doesn't provide the proper drivers to make the scanner portion usable."
3,WOW - I am surprised by all the negative HP feedback,"I have not bought this item nor any other HP printer in a long time. However, I did buy the HP 820 Cse years ago and I could not ask for a better printer. It has worked for years and I've had very few problems with it. When I needed to download new drivers, it was always fast and easy. If I had a problem, I could always find a solution either at the HP web site or other sites where fellow HP people discussed problems and solutions. I also always had great customer support if I had to call, which was very rarely.Apparently, from reading about this printer and many other HP printers sold on amazon, the quality has deteriorated drastically and service/customer support sucks. Too bad! HP was always known as having the BEST printers on the market. Sad how companies screw up.P.S. Amazon makes you enter a rating, so I was neutral @ 3!"
3,Problems From Beginning Seem to be Fixed,"I have never spent so much time with reps (In India no less) in trying to figure out problems. They sent me black & white new cartridge..that didn't help (I had brownish red print all the time.) Then another rep said it was the color cartridge an sent me one of those, THAT didn't work. Finally they sent me a new machine, sans the top which they said to keep and install on the new ""bottom."" Then, although all copies went through & the confirmation said they all went, the receivers kept telling me that they didn't get all copies. HP then sent me a new top, so virtually, my entire machine (except prints heads) were replaced. Now all seems to be OK. Good point - You can print on ""fast"" although the colors are faded when you use these method of copying. Reps were very nice but spent much too much valuable time on the phone with them."
1,Starts off great then DOWNHILL!!,"I had such great expectations for this machine. It had everything I needed. Sadly, after some very light usage, the colors on the printer and copier went straight into Hell!! The printer is now pure garabage and service from tech support runs out fast and you are stuck with a useless machine. The self-diagonistics are worthless.Stay away from this machine. Anyway, it has been discontinued and replaced with the HP 7310 and 7410. They share the same problems and I will alert buyers to this problem as well."
1,"Lifetime HP customer, DISAPPOINTED","This is my 3rd printer in about 15 years. All have been HP.The first two worked perfectly, never had any problems. Only reason for upgrade was new features (copy, scan, fax).This one worked great for many months.Then, I got horizontal lines in my color prints. Eventually HP sent a new machine and printheads and problem resolved.A few months later, same problem. Now that it's over a year old, no help from HP.The reviews are pretty much on target for quality, performance, and customer support. ALL POOR.Bummer, I had really enjoyed HP products."
1,A problem from the start,I will make this short and not very sweet. Avoid this machine for the following reasons:Scan never workedCannot be fully accessed through network without HP proprietary wireless card.HP claims that Belkin wifi ports are not compatable with this machine.Online support is nilDouble feeds pages
1,waste of money,Printheads went bad repeatedly. They replaced the printer for me. This was an entirely new system and it worked for a while and when it was time to replace the ink cartridges the printer would not recognize them. They were the correct ink cartridges. Now the printheads have gone bad again. It has been more than 90 days since I purchased the first one but only 1 month since the replacement arrived and they refuse to warranty it. The system has been down more than up. Find another brand.
1,INK CARTRIDGE SCAM BY HP,"This unit looks good in the box but when it comes to performance forget about it. The ink cartridges expire by date and not on the amount of ink you use. HP should be in a law suit over the message that pops up saying ""Color ink empty"" or ""Black ink empty"" when the ink cartridge is full. And if the Color cartridge is empty it will no longer make Black and White copies. How is that for customer satisfaction. No more HP products for me."
3,Sybex MCSA/MCSE Windows XP Professional Study Guide,"This books covers most but not all the areas that you are tested for the exams, which I discovered doing practice exams I will now buy MS Press Books for any MS exams in the future."
3,"Great movies, poor features","First off the movies are great. You can tell by the other reviews if you're interested in either of the movies themselves. My only problem is with the lack of features on both these DVDs. If you are a person that doesn't watch the bonus features or listen to the commentaries, then this double pack is the thing for you! Its a great deal in that case. I however like to listen to the commentaries and watch the ""making of"" features. Especially with good directors like Roman Polanski on Ninth Gate. I was pretty mad today when i went to wal mart and saw a new edition of Stir Of Echoes with added features (such as a commentary!!!!!).Oh, well."
2,A good reference manual,"If you like to read pages of XML and code examples than this book is for you. If you looking for load balancing & clustering strategies, then you'll be disappointed.This book thoughly covers the JBoss software, but is lite on advice and guides. Nearly half the book is code examples, DTD diagrams, and XML.I think this quote from the book is a good recommendation for the rest of it: ""JBossMQ fully implements the JMS specification; therefore, the best JBossMQ user guide is the JMS specification."""
3,Good Reference But Nothing Above Free Documentation,"I picked up this book to flush out a particular topic. I found most of the text in the book on that topic to be identical to the free texts available through the jBoss site. It's a good desk reference, but I do not think it offers more than what can be found in the free documentation and maybe a few minutes spent on a search engine."
2,Good Authors-Bad book,"Given the authors one would expect the book to be good. The text is okay but when you try to run the examples as you read you run into numerous problems. Some examples don't compile on Linux (but work well on Windows), others compile but don't run. Everytime I had a problem on Linux I'd shift to XP and life would be orders better.Some chapters are very well written. I like the one on JMX the best. Some are not so well written (Messaging)."
4,JBoss 4.0,"Great seller, condition (new), deliver was fast, prices low/reasonable.Very well written book. Gives outstanding step by step instructions and explanations.I would recommend this book if you are using JBoss 4.X. Be sure to check the version of JBoss before buying a book."
2,I found very little usage of this book for me,"This book is not about understanding how JBoss works. Or any other high level concept.It is about every little xml file that's needed to configure JBoss. The few samples of code are geared toward that as well.If you need to know that, then this book's for you."
3,"Reviews Interpreting Issues, but Outdated",The book is well-written and covers a lot of issues prospective interpreters need to consider and deal with before starting practice. However the testing information is completely outdated with the advent of the NIC test.
2,Not as good as expected,When I got this book nearly every page is marked on or bent in half. It makes it very difficult to actually read.
5,Odyssey Rocketbook,"This was the exact DVD I was looking for to help my students understand the story and characters of ""The Odyssey."" The DVD was delivered in a timely manner and right in time for when I needed it."
3,Dry Presentation,"While the Book summaries and pop quizzes are pretty thorough, the ""lecture"" format and stale setting do not hold students' interest. My students (honors-level freshmen) begged me to turn it off and review myself.Better for students who need a more step-by-step summary and a good alternative for sub plans.I had high hopes for this but was disappointed."
5,Great quality Keychain!,"I bought this for a girl I was going on a first date with (it happened to be her birthday). She was a mustang owner and this was the perfect gift. Fast forward 6 years. We are married (but this product wasn't the cause of that), and still have the mustang and this key chain. It has survived quite well. One of the best key chains I have purchased!"
5,Intimidating,"Priceless footage of 4 guys who knew how to play. The camera angles focus mainly upon the fretboard, enabling us to see how beautiful jazz guitar is when it's played well. If you like jazz guitar, you need this. Be prepared to quit the instrument, though...I'll never play this well."
5,Rare footage of a master playing with love,"For me, currently in my 50s, having played jazz guitar myself for years, this is as good as it gets. I love the man--he was so at peace with himself when playing, the lines just flowed from his heart and spirit, always an expression of peace and a smile on his face. That he died so young is a tragedy; the influence he had on jazz is incalculable. I watched this video with a friend and fellow Wes fan, and we were both in tears at the simple beauty that emanated from this man and his guitar, and the love that he expressed in his songs. If you want to see a video of the real thing, this is it, pure and simple.Legends of Jazz Guitar, Vol. 1"
3,"Well, That Was Interesting","Definitely an interesting book. But, it's nothing like normal Zelazny (if there is such a thing as ""normal"" with Zelazny's works). I almost put the book down shortly after starting it. The initial chapters were so short, the narration (by Snuff, the dog) was very simplistic (perhaps ""shallow"" is a better word), and the illustrations were pretty terrible, so I wondered if this might be a children's book. But, I persevered. Though the illustrations never get any better, the chapters lengthen and Snuff's narration skills grow as the book progresses. By the end, it's a pretty good read. This is sort of a tongue-in-cheek mild horror book and it's nowhere near as complex as I'm used to with Zelazny. But, it's definitely ""interesting"" and, overall, I rate it at an OK 3 stars out of 5."
2,Not worth the effort,"Every one of Zelazny's works that I'd read up to this point (several short stories and one novel) impressed me with delightful story-telling and vivid imagery. Unfortunately, this story fails to follow the trend.Jack the Ripper, Frankenstein, Sherlock Holmes, and American Werewolf in London. Determining who most of the characters are is one of the more entertaining parts of this book. But for the most part, it's a slow, plodding read with a disappointing ending.There are a few scenes worth savoring: the graveyard scene, and the many attempts by the Thing in the Circle to seduce our hero, Snuff. These scenes are not enough to save the book, though.If you wish to be complete in your perusal of Zelazny, go ahead and fight your way through, otherwise, leave this book on the shelf."
4,Light-hearted Treatment of the Victorian Age,"This is an extraordinary tale with all the oddball figures of the Sherlock Holmes era making a guest appearance. A highly entertaining and picturesque story, yet still, Zealazy's fans may find it less satisfying than the witty scenes he used to produce from time to time. Anyway, it is a nostalgic experience which leaves the reader wondering how much fun it can be to live through a chaotic halloween."
5,Zelazny: Supreme Again,"No other writer but Zelazny could take stock characters and situations from fantasy/horror and combine them so incredibly adeptly, yet seemingly effortlessly. Zelazny was the greatest sf writer ever, as far as I am concerned, and this work should remind everyone of just what a force he was...and his work remains. I re-read this book every Halloween."
4,Unusually Fun Book From a Master Sci-Fi Writer,"Master science fiction writer Roger Zelazny, best known for his (Nine Princes of) Amber Series takes an unusual romp in this lighthearted farce.The month is October, and all the cliché Victorian and Romance era horror characters (eg: Dr Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, Count Dracula, etc.) have come in the days before All Hallows Eve for a huge battle over the future of mankind...as narrated by Jack the Ripper's pet dog! Just spooky enough to be fun for Halloween; just light enough for adults and older children.This audio book version is a pleasant surprise: recorded in 1996 by the author himself shortly before his death, and for a long time thought lost, now restored. The audio quality is good, and the reading good, too, but this book really needs to be adapted into a radio play."
4,A good introduction to Zelanzy.,"This was the first book of Zelanzy's I've read, and I must say that it was thoroughly enjoyable. The whole book is told from the view of a dog named Snuff, who's master is Jack the Ripper.I won't go into what happens, but I will say you will not waste your time with this read."
4,As different as fantasy gets!,"Zelazny and Wilson combine for one of the strangest novels ever. Combining Lovecraft, Universal monsters, Jack the Ripper, and man's best friend as your humble narrator this book is a true original. There really is nothing to compare it to, a truly unique reading experience(and a lot of fun!)"
1,Turned out to be big dissapointment,"After about a month of good work the card died without any visible reason. Windows continued to see the card correctly, but it kept saying that network cable is disconnected.Indeed, the lights on the dongle were out, as well as the lights on the router. I tried different cables, but it did not help. I sent the card to NetGear for replacement.I got another card. It worked fine for a week and then began to show bad contact between the dongle and the card. I needed to adjust the dongle in its slot slightly in order to make it work. Slight movement caused the contact to stop.In both cases the dongle was physically intact, and I handled it with care. I did not expose it to extreme pressures or to dirty environments.I gave it up and ordered LinkSys PCM200 card with integrated connector - no more dongles!"
2,Windows NT nightmare,"This product is not well supported for the Windows NT environment. They blame the configuration problems on the laptop manufacturer who in turn blames Netgear. The real culprit is probably NT, but Netgear they shouldn't advertise it for NT if they can't support it."
1,Come on folks.. lets get the specs right,"OK, fine. I'm the first to admit that I'm not a tech head. That's why I always do my best to match product specs with the system I am buying for. After doing this to the best of my ability it was annoying to realize that this card did not fit into the PCMCIA slots on either of my 4 year old laptops. The company provided specs need to be more straight forward."
1,Dont' dare,"This is terrible product. The connection between the network card and yout note book depends on a connecting wire which gets destroyed easily. No oned carry the accessory, so you have to order it fro about [money amount]+ S&H"
1,Worst product I have ever ordered,Charged the battery for 12 hours and used only once. The battery won't hold a charge anymore. Don't Waste your time or money.
4,Coming of age for Mr. To'Teras,"Here is how I would describe Five Bucks: Take Dave Matthews, subtract the Band, add some heart, a touch of soul and a pinch of humor. Seeing Robert live is a whole different story. He has to be one of the most passionate players I have ever seen. He has the ability to flip from agressive to gentle at the drop of a hat (anyone's hat will do!) I cant wait for his next project. The music labels need to wake up and ink this guy."
5,"""Five Bucks"" is a riveting testament to To'Teras' ability.","""Five Bucks"" is Robert To'Teras' strongest work to date. His riveting, powerful singing style and the ingenuity of his lyrics, while also evident in his earlier album with the band ""Circus Boy"", have now become much more finely focused. With this acoustic, solo album, To'Teras' strength on guitar gets the long-overdue focus and credit it deserves. As a long time fan back from the artist's West End Gate days, I welcome the arrival of this personal, moving album."
3,Mixture of movie scores,Contains a collection of movie scores from Bernard Herman. I got it because I wanted to hear the one's from Farenheight 451. They are originals but not all of them are there--just chosen pieces.
3,color,"The product was nice, but I was looking for a darker stone. If you want a nice medium blue stone, this is a great deal."
1,pornography,"Approximately 10 minutes of this video is teaching. The remaining are the ""first-time"" dancers having sex with their ""boyfriends"" or ""husbands"". I would have never bought this video had I known that it is strickly porn. It is definately full blown porn. I wouldn't waste my money."
3,Topper: The Adventures of Topper,"I was disappointed, not a good as I remebered as a kid and surely did not like cigarett commercials still intact, but probably a good keepsake to remind you of days gone by"
5,Best deal anywhere!!!!,I've been buying K&N filters for my vehicles for years. It arrived on time and I installed it right away. Now my Pontiac Grand Prix GTP gets some air to the supercharger. I am trying this before I invest into the intake kit. So far so good!!!! I have noticed no change in fuel economy although I suspect that will change as my foot gets heavier. I can hear the supercharger a bit more now. Get one!!!
1,Wrong filter,"This product don't fit a 2004 545i BMW,can not return it waited to long before it opened box I will not order this product again."
3,2006 grand prix,"I purchased this filter for my 06' grand prix and it slightly lowered the mileage I was getting. It went from mid 24 mpg to mid 23 mpg, not a big deal for me but it seemed strange to get lower mileage. Simple install and good price."
4,"Excellent, but what about the last 100 pages?","""Signal Shattered"" picks up the ever more complex plot of cross and double cross in ""Signal to Noise"". It has pace. It does sometimes becomes clogged, but then picks up again in a good way.The end of ""Signal Shattered"" is almost as if Neylund _had_ to finish it and ran out of ideas, time or energy. The solution the main character finds to get out of the loop he has been manipulated in, was a dissappointment.If you can copy yourself and your pocket quantum supercomputer and multiply your intelligence into infinity and beyond with each copy of yourselve, I believe I would have gone for a different solution, turning the tables in one last and final ""triple cross"".I blame the editor of Avon.A little more time, a little more effort could have make this book an absolute masterpiece. Now it gets 4 stars instead of the 6 it could have had."
4,"A winner, and a great sequel.","A Signal ShatteredEric NylundThis book, a wonderful sequel to Signal to Noise is everything and more than its predecessor. Highly entertaining - extremely high science set in space and involving everything from interdimensional communciation to buddhist monks. What's not to like?Dominic Ebacherebacherdom.blogspot.com071111.0000"
4,A Shattering Climax!,"I bought this book first. After reading the first page I saw it was a sequel. After reading ""A Signal To Noise"" ..., I immediately read this one and was greatly impressed. Mr. Nylund's treatment of a rather mystical and spritual approach to problem solving and plot building is indeed enlightening. I highly recommend this book to buy and await any sequel or more of this type...."
2,Not half as good as Signal To Noise,"While the very enjoyable Signal To Noise took an idea and made it plausible through rooting it in a coherent and therefore believable reality, A Signal Shattered reads as something spat out at a great rate - and without much thought. It follows the virtual end of the human race and the struggle of Our Hero to make use of those he saved and his former business parters' machinations and insanity. However, the sense that the characters are actually rooted in humanity is lost through their apparently straightforward intelligence increase and their step-by-step progress through to a disappointingly mundane conclusion.References to the first book are given throughout in choppy paragraph form, written as an afterthought for those reading the book in an aircraft lounge. Read Signal To Noise (or better still, A Game of Universe), but it's best to skip this sequel, no matter how great your love of speculative mathematics."
2,"First book was good, this one was fair.","I really enjoyed the first book (which you must read before this one to make any sense of it at all), but this book left me pretty flat. It did not continue with the sense of adventure and discovery that the first had. While this book was an interesting read, I'm not sure I would have finished it if I wasn't trapped on a plane at the time. If you liked the first book and don't have anything else from your library pressing, give it a read."
4,Great book...However...,"This is a well written overview of techniques and information on wreck diving:that being said, it will never replace a decently taught course from an organization such as NAUI, PADI, SSI, or BSAC. By all means, buy this book! It's a teriffic addition to any diver's library. It does *not* take the place of a wreck diver's certification course."
4,Complete Wreck Diving: A Guide to Diving Wrecks,"Although not complete from a technical diving aspect, this is a great primer on how to start a research project. There are ample examples of historical resources, of what to do if one finds a wreck, how to lay claim, etc. Overall alot of good information on wreck diving."
4,Before taking the training,A good book. It answered several of my questions and answered questions that I didn't know to ask. NOT a substitute for training but a good addition. It actually increased my interest in wreck diving. Also an easy read and suggests many places to find wreck to dive on.
3,Nice overview,"I was expecting to learn something about the subject of wreck diving. A book titled ""Complete Wreck Diving"" should be more than a general overview of the subject with little details or specifics. The author thought it was important to let his readers know at great detail that it would be important to learn how to read a chart to find a shipwreck. In a word Duh!This book would have been better titled ""Wreck Diving for Dummies"" there is very little here that a diver contemplating wreck diving would not have thought about and there is very little information in this book on the subject.While that may be a harsh review I did read the whole book and I enjoyed the last chapter on artifact restoration, it had real world solutions to real problems. A beginning wreck diver might want this book to at least learn what the questions are that would require some other book or books to answer."
4,A solid historical perspective,"Readers interested in this genre should have this book in their collection. Rita Schiano, author ""Painting The Invisible Man""Painting the Invisible Man"
1,STILL WAITING ......,I ordered this for a gift and it did say it would be a while for delivery but I'm still waiting and if it doesn't get here soon it's going to be too late.

4,"It's not a Palm V, that's why I bought it for my mom!","I couldn't synch my eDiary up with other Palm V toting engineers at the Java One conference. Even though it doesn't require a special written language to enter information, my busy mom is able to keep track of her schedule, phone numbers, to-do items, and costs in convenient lists by pecking on a keyboard layout on the display.She can copy/paste and cross reference any text from any one of these lists with text in another list by highlighting the text and switching the view.She's a little wary of plugging the eDiary into the computer to use a regular keyboard to type the information or creating back ups of her data.The only thing that I wish I could do is directly transfer my meeting maker data to the eDiary."
1,2001 bug,"I bought this unit last year and was initially very happy with it. However, early in 2000 I discovered there was a bug in the 2.x units. The date and day of week will not line-up when the calendar rolls over to 2001. The manufacturer knows about the problem, but has not addressed how to fix the outstanding ones. My advice is to make sure you get one of the new ones, or else you will be very disappointed."
4,fuga ediary,I purchased this device and was very happy with it. I am a college student and was looking for a personal organizer. I found the ediary on Amazon and purchased it right away. It fit all my needs and would recommend it as an organizer to everybody who is looking for one.
2,Good drill/driver but very bads batteries,"The drill/driver is a good machine, works very nice, but the batteries becomes unusable in a few months, and is very difficult to find new batteries.sorry but I never will buy again a Coleman drill..."
3,Perhaps Osserman bit off more than he could chew...,"I had the feeling while reading this book that Osserman had simply taken upon himself something that couldn't be done: describing the entire universe in 170 pages with sufficient clarity so that any layman could understand it.Being one of those laymen, I must admit that I learned quite a bit from this book. Nevertheless, Osserman's jumpy writing style with frequent digressions makes for a sometimes frustrating read. I also noted a certain effort to make the ""story"" of the book conform to the title (which should have been something along the lines of ""Curvature of the Universe"").In any case, for those (like myself) with a passive interest in cosmology and very little prior knowledge, this book is not a bad starting point. Having finished the book, I at least know where to begin looking for more information about the topic."
5,"Great intro to ""mapping the universe""","This is probably the best explanation of the make up of the cosmos that I have ever read. It clearly illustrates why mathematics is necessary for understanding the shape and features of the universe, and provides the reader with promising answers to age old questions about its origins and evolution. You'll also get a very interesting presentation of the most prominent mathematicians involved in this field through the ages.Bear in mind that the book is written in 1995 and therefore somewhat outdated when it comes to more recent theories and results from actual space exploration. But it is still a great introduction to build on."
2,Good title no substance,"The title Diving On The Edge implies that you'll receive new cutting edge dive information. That's not the case here, the book contains nothing really new regarding dive equipment and care, dive technique, dive locations or dive experiences. It's basiclly a truncated rehash of very elementary information, ready available from other sources. (see section on equipment especially snorkel selection)The book did contain some good safety advice and is written in a style that most divers will probably relate to. Better research and more detail is badly needed. Definately not ""cutting edge"" material"
3,Good beginner book - very basic.,"Good book for the beginner, lacks the detail to be anything like a ""how to"" - but covers the basics and the jargon."
4,Good environmental information,"This isn't so much a ""how to dive"" book as it is ""how to dive responsibly."" Good environmental information. Excellent for any would-be diver to think about."
3,Verdi: Requiem,purchased for my wife's choir practice. Have heard it many times and while it is a classic i've heard it enough!
2,Messa da Requiem on this recording does not work for me,"Regarding the Messa da Requiem only: With the volume adjusted to an enjoyable level to listen to the orchestra, the vocal soloists are almost inaudible. With the volume turned up to a level adequate to hear the vocal soloists, after the orchestra starts to play again, the volume is much to loud. Would appreciate recommendations for a recording of Verdi's Requiem which does not have this problem. Or, if you have this recording and it sounds good to you, please let me know."
4,Reading with Tequila,"Grave Secrets was a suspenseful joyride into the world of forensic anthropology. There were twists. There were turns. There were red herrings and false clues. There was also a love-triangle-ish scenario that seemed to create some unnecessary romantic tension. Relationship issues aside, Grace Secrets was one of the best Temperance Brennan books yet."
4,A Fan of Detail? Ms. Reichs Provides It,"Kathy Reichs is an anthropologist who has taken her true profession & has begun a new career as an author with it.She uses her knowledge & nicely weaves a serial murder mystery out of it. Hijacked to Guatemala by the government, her protagonist, Tempe Brennan, works with local authorities to solve some sticky cases there.Ms. Brennan undoubtedly is the pseudo persona for Reichs. Basically, the same profession. The character of Tempe Brennan is likable, capable, and believable.The forensics in Ms. Reichs books goes down to the most minuscule details. Difficult for a lay person to keep track of at times, but very entertaining & interesting.I had read ""Deadly Decisions"" some time back & did not like it. A friend had lent me several of her books. I decided to give her another go. Ms. Reichs has a new fan"
4,The Aftermath of Political Slaughter,"In this mystery, Temperance Brennan, Kathy Reichs's forensic anthropologist protagonist, takes her show on the road as part of a team of medical examiners working in Guatemala under the auspices of the Truth Commission there. Reichs conveys the claustrophobic and sometimes panicky feelings of anyone, including officially invited American citizens, can experience when working in the killing fields of the bloodiest civil war of the Americas.Worth reading both for fans of this series (of which I am one) and for fictional look at the aftermath of political slaughter."
3,Change of scenery was a good choice,"Grave Secrets takes place in Guatemala, and it seems that Reichs has gotten the hang of translating foreign phrases in her text, and although I understand Spanish, it's certainly welcome.While not as fast paced and compelling as her last novel, this is still a solid mystery with several red herrings that were not too poorly utilized. Reichs really wants to highlight the struggles and victimization of indigenous Guatemalans and pay tribute to those brutalized by the government until as recently as 1996. That's quite admirable, but those parts of the story don't have a lot to do with the rest of it, except as a device to get Tempe to Guatemala in the first place.The best part is the intensifying relationship between Tempe and Ryan, but when Tempe works with Detective Galiano to solve the Guatemalan murders it seems Ryan may have a rival for Tempe's affection. Ooooh, who will she choose?"
4,Temperance Brennan Books,"This is my 8th book of Temperance Brennan series, and as usual,it is totally engrossing. A must read."
1,don't lecture me,"Reichs' heavy handed way of getting the scientific explanations in through dialogue frequently brings the novel to a standstill. The storyline is interesting enough but the writing style is uninteresting, perhaps even sophomoric."
3,A mixed bag,"I am new to the Tempe Brennan series and I found ""Grave Secrets"" both somewhat enjoyable and somewhat frustrating. I am a big fan of the mystery/thriller genre and I believed, at the outset of the story, that this book would fit the bill. However, Ms. Reichs departed from a tale where our heroine unearths and identifies Guatemalan victims of massacres and wonders haphazardly into a story of a possible serial killer, police/government corruption, and plots to create a black market for stem cells, peppered with extended explanations of DNA and stem cell research. The story contains more characters than the reader can reasonably follow and a fair number of very dull jokes. Also, I believe that many of the scientific explanations were both long and boring and that the ending was rather implausible. Overall, the story was enjoyable but, by no means, a great work of fiction."
2,Don't bother with this one,"Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? You read and read and everything you read is meaningless. The main character goes from Guatemala to Canada looking for a killer here and there, and when you'll finish it you'll find mirth in yourself because you won't have to open it again."
2,A Disappointment,This novel was a disappointment.The story starts out well but the ending is just ridiculous.Also too farfetched is the plot device that brings Ryan into the story again.All in all I would have to say that this book is by far the weakest of the series.
3,GRAVE SECRETS,ALTHUGH I ENJOYED THIS BOOK I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE BEST THE AUTHOR HAS WROTE. FOR ME THE STORY JUMPED AROUND TOO MUCH AND WAS VERY CONFUSING.
4,Why The Coincidences,"This is the fifth in the series, and the coincidences are too much! Really! This plot is great, the change of locale is intriguing. But she runs into a guatemalan raised in Canada (?) was is an old friend of her old flame (?). Ms. Reichs must move in a very small circle of friends. She is having a hard time imagining other characters for her stories. The forensic writing is great, as usual. The action is fierce. Please stop the coincidences!! A great read, otherwise!"
2,Grave Secrets-gravely disappointing.,I found this book not worthy of the wonderful and suspensful previous books by this author. I felt very let down after waiting a long while for this new book to come out. The characters in the book were not clear cut to me. I found most of the plot confusing and the end part of Temperence going off by herself after becoming so terribly ill with apparent food poisoning highly improbable and contrived. The author is capable of much finer work. Loved Fatal Voyage and ALL her other books!
5,"Not the TV show, but really enjoyable","Temperance on TV and Tempe in the book are similar characters, but if you forget about the TV show and just enjoy the book, you'll find yourself hooked on a great plot, a few interesting twists, and other characters that make the book interesting. I'm reading the entire series, and each book, while focused around forensics, has a unique plot, several recurring characters, and a geographic variety that makes each book a great read."
2,Grave Secrets,"Started out very well, very interesting mystery. However, all of the questions were answered in the last few pages and the reader has no way to guess all the complicated relationships. It is like the author had to unravel all the mystery in two pages! There is also a romantic angle to this and the author withholds who ends up with the heroine.I was very disappointed in the ending in all aspects."
3,"Slow, but steady","I really did enjoy Grave Secrets and it did keep me reading as I read in a weekend, however I agree that was not really a thriller. The action occurred at a sedate pace and I often wondered why Tempe kept up with the case once her part of the investigation was completed. The end was too fast and didn't connect all the dots that were left behind. The Guatemalan aspect of the book was very interesting as being an Australian we don't hear much news from South America."
4,For English Teachers and Grammarians,A good collection on how the English language is misused. Examples generate laughter and smiles from the reader. . . . Only English teachers and grammarians will appreciate this book.
5,"Simple, but sharp","My daughter is in Middle school and she thinks these are really cool. When a mom can get it right for a middle schooler, they have to be great earrings!!"
1,Help,I never received it - I have tried numerous times to get someone to acknowledge the fact and have not gotten a response. I will not buy from Amazon again
3,Stunning Flight Footage!,This is a must see film for the pigeon fancier! The pictures of the birds in flight are excellent! You'll truly get the feeling of what it is to be in flight with the birds!
5,Best hiking guide for the area,"I love Sullivan's hiking books for all the reasons mentioned previously. I took them for granted until a recent trip to Glacier, Yellowstone, and the Tetons. I purchased Falcon guides and they were horrible. Sullivan does an incredible job in his books in describing 1) difficulty of hike 2) trailhead directions 3) directions along the hike 4) sites to see along hike including flora. This is absolutely the book to own if you want to hike in the Portland area. I have multiple editions and the coastal range book as well. I will buy new editions as well. It makes me want to write a decent hiking guide for Glacier and the Tetons myself."
5,The best for the region,"I have found Sullivan's hiking books to be the best ones for the regions he covers. They are not too verbose, but have clear enough directions that it is hard to get lost either finding the trailhead or on the hike. He doesn't take you to any dangerous spots without warning you, and the difficulty ratings are pretty accurate (at least for me.) I have hiked about 35% of the hikes in the book and have only found one error. When I emailed him about it, he was very grateful for the correction and promised to check it out before the next edition. He obviously is committed to the quality of his books and to the wilderness experience in general."
4,Very helpful,"Very helpful for planning day hikes from Portland. It provided length of trail, elevation gain, difficulty and interesting information about each trail."
5,The Best of the Best,"I have lived in southern Washington and traveled in northern Oregon extensively. This book was a real eye opener! It offered hikes that I never knew existed. I am a fan of wildflowers and this book has a section of color photos of wildflowers while each hike's description tell the hiker which flowers to keep an eye open for.The maps are very accurate as are the elevation gains. After a couple of hikes the reader will begin to gauge his idea of easy, moderate or difficult as compared to the author's. I do suggest wearing a pedometer when using this book on hikes as the author may tell the reader ""1.2 miles down the trail, keep to the left - do not take the wider path to the right"".The highest praise that I can give this book is the fact that I gave my copy away as a present and bought myself a second copy."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,This is a perfect book for all level of hikers. Great book to get when getting to know a new area.
5,Like having a best freind that knows all of 'the' spots!,I love this book. We have been to a number of the included destinations and the directions and descriptions have not let us down. Well written in a personal fun style. I love how the writer offers additions and suggestions to destinations that are close by to do multiple trips (when applicable).
3,unhappy,"I guess I was expecting more than I got. The knife is not spring assisted, its not as easy to open as spring assisted. And its too big for my hand. It resides in my tool box now unused. My last knife purchase was a Kershaw, very easy to open, again to big for me. My last knife is a small Kershaw with a 2 3/4"" blade that I love. To be honest I have small hands and the Kershaw was more than twice the price. Same old story, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"
1,Waste of money,The maps would not not show county roads when transferring way points had to get google maps. Did not solve any issues because the new maps would not work.
2,Not that great,The item is not easy to use and figure out. It would be easier to just use a paper map than a gps with this disk.
3,Useless without separately purchased maps,"This appears to be a decent product but it is useless without separately purchased maps. I thought that by purchasing a Garmin GPS unit and this software that I could create my own routes. You can create routes, but not without the maps which are not included."
4,"Good service, product is a bit dated",It was a step down to use this product after two years of working with Google Earth. But it definitely got the job done. The service from the vendor was excellent and the software is a big improvement over manually entering all the waypoints on my next trip.
4,jonathan eandi,"I rated this product ( E-MU EM7707 PRO USB/MIDI CONTROLLER KEYBOARD) four stars, not that there was anything wrong with the keyboard,it is just that I had a terrible time getting the thing to work .It could come with better instructions & maybe a video to help figure it out.I still haven`t got it to work the way it should. Do you have any suggestions? HELP PLEASE!"
5,Thorlo's Basketball Socks,"For anyone who is opting to buy these basketball socks, do it.If you want extra padding around the Achilles, heel, and bottom of your feet without the tight feeling of wearing double socks, then these socks are for you.QUALITY: I haven't noticed any signs of tear whatsoever, considering I play b-ball everyday and I've had the socks now for about 3 months. One thing to point out is that you should always tumble-dry Thorlo's, never heat dry because that could potentially weaken the material.LOOK: These particular socks go past the calves and STAY at the bottom of the knee.Overall, if your still hesitant to try them out, just buy one at first and you won't be displeased!-Ben Jammin"
3,Slow Start....,"I am slowly becoming a fan of Ms. Monroe... and was excited to see a follow-up to ""God Don't Like Ugly"" which I found to be teriffic... however, this book took a while to grab me... I was not at all interested in finding out how everyone's lives had changed in the years that passed since the first novel... the story just sort of dragged along, however it was not until Rhoda showed back in town, that the interest peak and she doesnt show up until around page 40 or 50.I like the short chapters, which helped the book move but the start is the most difficult to get past. Once I was mid way through the story, the action got more intense from the meeting of her fiance's family and the fall out of the wedding to the end when we find out what rhoda's true fate has been....push yourself in th ebeginning, finish this story and feel like you have just accomplished A LOT!!!"
4,"Monroe, honey you are wonderful!","I liked ""God Don't Like Ugly"" and I also liked this sequel, ""God Still Don't Like Ugly"". The two books told an incredible story of endurance and forgiveness. Though this book was truly an enjoyable read, it revisits the first one too much.In this half of the tale, Annette and Rhoda are both adults and still face their share of trials. Annette comes into contact with her long lost father and her siblings. She also finds herself a fiancee by the name of Jerome Cunningham. At first, they are happy together, but when one of his family members find out that she is a former prostitute, he calls their entire relationship off. So, she finds love in her childhood friend Pee Wee. Rhoda resurfaces and has a family of her own. But, by the end of the story, she endures a bad turn of events.I enjoyed this book. I read it in no time. This author has a gift and it is illustrated in her writing. I really like Mary Monroe! I know Mary, God don't like ugly..."
4,GOOD READ!!!!,"I ENJOYED THIS SEQUEL, I ALSO LIKED THAT IT REFRESHED YOU ON WHAT HAD ALEADY TAKEN PLACE IN THE STORY. ANNETTE THOUGHT THAT THE THINGS SHE WAS DOING WAS TO HELP OTHERS BUT IN GOD'S EYES IT WAS WRONG. AND IT PROVED EVEN MORE HOW JUST GOD REALLY IS. I THINK THIS BOOK ALSO DID A GOOD JOB OF SHOWING HOW IN THE END TRUE LOVE CAN PREVAIL, FOR BOTH ANNETTE AND RHONDA. GOOD READ!!!"
5,"God Don't like UGLY, God Still don't like Ugly","I love her books, she is the BOMB!!! I just could not put the book down. It grabbed my attention from page 1. I love Mary Monroes books. I plan to read them all."
2,I Still Liked The First One Better,"Mary Monroe is an awesome author, and immediately after I found out she had planned a sequel for God Don't Like Ugly, I waited with baited breath. Not everything can be as good as the original. That's for sure.As good as the first novel was and all her subsequent novels were, something tells me that the fault does not lie in Mary Monroe for this sequel falling so flatly. I could be wrong (I usually am), but something tells me a hatchet job was done on this book. The characters were not nearly as strong or well written as the first book, and the story itself just meandered about until it came to a much needed rest.Very disappointing and definitely not up to Ms. Monroe's usual caliber."
2,Disappointed,"After reading ""God Don't Like Ugly"", which I loved, I was excited and looking forward to reading the sequel. To my surprise, I found the it to be laborious and boring. For the most part of this book, Mary Monroe reviewed the events of the first book. I was completely disappointed."
2,Bored,"I was totally bored with this book until I got closer to the ending. I read ""God Don't Like Ugly"" and couldn't put it down, but the follow up was a disappointment."
2,"Not pleased, not pleased at all","After reading God Don't Like Ugly, I expected much more from Mary Monroe. This book took me quite a while to become interested in it. The story seemed slow and a little too cookie cutter when Rhoda and Annette were reunited. If Annette was really frightened by Rhoda, why was she so quick to reconcile with her? I was disappointed~the previous novel was much better."
2,Disappointment,Fell short of what was expected. Story was too neat and cookie-cutter-like. It insulted the intelligence of the reader and I just didn't buy it. I hate to write such a review because I have loved Mary Monroe's work up to this point but this is something I will never recommend.
4,"Great Follow up on ""God Still Don't Like Ugly""","This was a great follow up to the first book ""God Don't Like Ugly"". It was not as intriguing as the first but still a great read, very enjoyable and very re-latable. I am looking forward to reading more of Mary Monroe's Books, she is becoming one of my favorite authors."
4,Thoroughly enjoyed it!,"This is the second one of Mary's books that I read and I am still in love with this series. Her writing is so descriptive and the characters so real! Love, love it!"
4,Almost as good as God Don't Like Ugly,"This book takes over a few years after God Don't Like Ugly leaves off. Annette, off on her own, tries to carve out a life for herself and wrestle the demons from her past. Returning to her hometown, she rekindles past relationships, begins a relationship with her dad who abandoned her long ago, and she and her mom learn that he wasn't entirely a bad guy. This novel, much like the first one, deals with heavy issues--childhood abuse, parental abandonment, prostitution, obesity, etc., but it also is one of those novels that makes you think. Rarely are people or events entirely good or bad, and maybe we should be less closed-minded and more quick to forgive. Though this book did rehash some of the events from the first one, it also gave nice closure to the story. Like most sequels, I didn't like it quite as well as the first one, but it was still a very good book. Read God Don't Like Ugly first, and then this one."
3,Flick for Runaways fans,"Fans of 70's rock group The Runaways are urged to view this movie to see Runaways' lead singer Cherie Currie all grown-up in the role of ""Michelle"". The movie's plot is cute, but the best parts of the movie are the stage scenes with Cherie rockin'!"
4,The Great Neck lunatic at his funniest,"Milos Forman's Man On The Moon was my introduction to Andy Kaufman and, having loved the film, I decided to check out the real thing. My initial fear was that the stories of Kaufman's antics would be funnier than his actual performances. This video proved me wrong - the man is a genius, folks. His Elvis impression still stuns, and the transformation into a puppet of his most terrifying creation, Tony Clifton, is a stroke of pure brilliance. For life long fans and beginners alike, this is a comedy bullseye."
4,He's From Hollywood. He Has The Brains.,"There is no disputing the genius of Andy Kaufman, and this DVD encapsulizes it extremely well. As you watch this old PBS special, you will feel like you are watching pro wrestling, Andy's favorite. You know it's all rigged, yet the little voice in the back of your mind peeps to you, ""Is it REALLY?""The fight with Elaine boosler is HILARIOUS, and ""Has-Been Corner"" will make you cringe. The silly, kiddie antics thrown in by Andy will make you giggle, and the Tony Clifton puppet is a perfect sidekick! Oh, and catch the height of Andy's desk as a subliminal sleight to Johnny Carson!This DVD will delight every Andy Kaufman fann, yet it will only prove to those who don't like him the reasons why they don't. IF you love Andy like I do, buy this. If you don't, go listen to your Andrew Dice Clay tapes again."
5,"Negative cable, not positive","This is a negative battery cable, not positive as the picture shows. The secondary lead is the correct gage, not like what you would get at your local auto parts shop. Be very careful and use 2 wrenches when removing the block end. There are 2 wires with very short leads behind the battery cable on the same stud and if they turn at all, it will break the terminal and there is very little room to put a new one on and make it reach the stud."
3,beautiful but a little disappointing...,"I just recently became a fan of Olivia's work and without a doubt it is all very beautiful and captivating. My only concern with this latest book is that her collection isn't as broad as the past two books. Some of the artwork is shown on one page, and the facing has a couple up close versions of the same, unlike her first books which have a new wonderful piece on each page. I also agree with the other review in saying that the models seem to be a little more masculine... the first books are just as powerful but also more feminine. I would definitely recommend buying this, but also including her other books as well..."
2,a slight disappointment,"I was expecting much better from Olivia. Many of her models seem masculine, especially the cover model. Any long time fan of her's will miss Bella, Rhonda, & (and even Pam) her other more feminine models. Check out her other books ""Let them eat Cheesecake"" & ""Second Slice"". They're sure to not disappoint."
4,At their best.,This is one of the finest recordings of either artist. Buddy does not overplay-as he often does. Instead he pairs up with longtime running mate Junior to produce some down home delta blues. Pinetop Perkins leads an odd supporting cast which includes bassist Bill Wyman yet they manage to pull it off nicely. Classic cuts by some classic bluesmen whose egos had yet to derail their performances as they would later on in their careers. The sound quality is also quite good. This one's worth getting...Simon
4,"Practical, reassuring guide for a time of uneasy transition","After more than a dozen years as a dean of first-year students, I sent my own first child off to college five years ago, after an anxious and tearful summer. My own vast professional experience proved to be an embarrassment, as I forgot all the speeches I had made to parents encouraging them to ""let go."" This book is a guide that puts it all in perspective, from the practical preparations through the uneasy transitions of the first year. Having read it, I will be much better prepared when my second daughter goes off to college this year. In fact, I plan to keep it on my night stand."
2,Of minimal use to most people,"This book might be useful in families where the child is the first ever to go to college, but for the rest of us it's pretty lame. There's no significant info here -- you can get more and better from your child's high school guidance counselor.And there's really nothing about ""parent[al] survival"" in it. Barkin warns of feelings of loss and disconnect, but other than to say that many people go thru this, there's no useful info.Check that: her suggestion to bring a toolkit and duct tape is excellent, but I didn't need a book to think of that.Save your bux and post to a Yahoo forum instead."
5,Great Book for Parents with High School Students,"This is one of the best books for parents with high school students. It will help you anticipate and handle the transition you and your child will go through as they become a young adult in college and you begin the ""empty nest"" process."
1,Broke after one month,"I was pleased when I bought this item. It works great, but after just one month the plastic on the tip of the cutter broke and the wires would no longer stay in place. I had to toss it."
1,Shoddy at Best,"This cheese slicer seemed appealing, considering that you have the ability to slice at three widths. However, after using the slicer for less than two weeks, on of the wires broke the plastic cap at the top, rendering it useless. I would highly recommend not purchasing this slicer and opting for one without cheap plastic parts."
5,Tri-Cut Cheese Slicer - Love It,I have had it for quite a long time and I love it.I am trying to find it so I can buy it for my relatives who have tried it and think it is cool.Anyone know where I can find it.
2,Tri-Cut Cheese Slicer,After about a week of use the wires stretch. It is still usable but it indicates the slicer is not designed for the long haul.
1,Ouch!!!,"This was a horrible excursion into what I assume is considered comedy. Well, it ain't funny. I think listening to this gave me ear cancer."
3,"OK, but...","Marley's Ghost and Van Dyke Parks count among my favorites, so I had high hopes for this. But it's all kind of muddled and not quite right. Even if there's some good stuff here, ""Live at the Freight"" this ain't. Even among their studio albums, there's better. Certainly, none of the other Marley's Ghost albums sound as non-Marley as this."
5,Can't stop playing with this phone!,"I have a tip for the first reviewer that says this phone does not have vibrate alert. You have to change the PIX, TXT, Voice, Email alerts to ""no ring"" (one or all), then change your Alert Vibrate to ""on."" It worked when I did it. Overall, this is a great phone with good sound quality when you are taking a call in a noisy area. I never thought I'd want a camara phone, but this is a fun option. The color quality on the screen is awesome. The menus are intuitive and you don't even need to refer to the manual to use the features."
4,Satisfactory Phone But service from Verizon,"Sharp, crisp screen. Above Average UI, but bad compared to Nokia's. Good Grip. Screen sucks up too much of battery life, below average battery performance. Overall Above avg experience.But I have a very bad experience with Verizon. Will not go back to Verizon for a long time."
3,Funky reception with LG VX7000,"Verizon reception is great & keeps getting better. However--with the the LG VX7000 phone I get lousy reception (static, intermittent conversation breaks, dropped calls due to weak connection, etc.) whereas my sturdy Motorola cell phone gets stronger signals in the same areas.The photo feature is fun, however my digital camera does a much better job (LG photos are pretty grainy). A real plus for this phone is the light weight and its fairly long charged time.I guess if the fun factor (it does have a larger screen than some), weight, & charged time are important to you, this may be a good phone to consider. And I also would encourage you to check out the Motorola 700 series before you commit yourself to the LG. Many of the same ""pro's"" would apply, plus you get the better reception."
2,Beware of LG Phones,"I have owned two LG phones including the VX7000 and I had problems with both phones powering down for no reason. I have friends that also own LG phones and they have had the same problem. Verizon has provided me with a new VX7000 however I lost all of my downloads. I had similar problems with an early version of the VX7000 LG phone too. It would powerdown if you laid it down facing up. I had to always have it laying on its side to prevent it from turning off. Overall, I thought that this phone provided good features for the money. This review is just to make you aware of the phone turning off without reason. If you experience this problem, return it immediately to get a new one because it can not be fixed and the frequency of the powering off will increase as the phone ages."
2,Regret this purchase,"I consider this phone almost useless due to the unacceptable amount of dropped calls I now deal with. I blame the phone because when I'm standing next to a friend that has Verizon and a different phone they'll have at least two more ""bars"" than I have and never drop calls. Even when my phone shows three bars I'll drop a call. I have updated the software several times and delt with Verizon's ""Costomer support"" (Ha) several times neither of which made a difference. They (Either Verizon or LG, I'm not sure which) have also made it very difficult to transfer pics and ringtones to and from the phone without an extra charge."
1,Great toy HORRIBLE sounding earpiece!,"I recently renewed my Verizon Contract. I really liked the way this LG 7000 looked...so I bought it. The phone has great features, it's pretty, the camera is decent..but to my ears the sound in the earpiece is beyond terrible! If you speak with other cell users often you have to keep saying what? Cause there is NO treble at all in the earpiece. It's as if you had a stereo and the tweeters were blown. I began to hate the SOUND so much..I finally reactivated my old BORING Startac..and it has just replaced this LG. The Startac sounds like a high end stereo vs an AM radio in this LG.Notice most of the reviews here talk about the ringtones, camera, lights etc. etc...but how about SOUND? If you like a pretty phone with a ton of features this phone is great. If you value SOUND quality and HEARING the other party...run for the hills before buying this phone. The LG is loud though..almost too loud even on the ear piece's lowest setting."
4,Where's my speakerphone and Bluetooth???,"This phone is almost perfect. Just add speakerphone and Bluetooth. Then I wouldn't need cords, or to buy a pda."
3,disappointed,"I thought for the price the phone would have more options.I was surprised it does not have speaker phone. Also it does not show the person calling on the front screen. This is my first cell phone, so it works well other wise. I just thought for the price it would have had speaker phone."
2,VX7000 second thoughts,"Think again before purchasing this phone. I bought it because the Consumer Report had it as #1. They were joking. It is bulky, display is for almost blind with font #46 letters, it has ugly graphics and limited features for programming our options. The reception is average, it doesn't work inside the house, but gets 3 bars on the driveway(?)(Friend's other phones work just fine inside). With the cover light, which is right above the front display you could control the traffic on the bussiest intersection in your town, it is really bright, ugly and tottaly not cool. I have never seen anything like this - what did they think off? But what pisses me off the most is that these lights flash to let you know that the battery is low - which I consider somehow stupid because it is draining your battery even faster. So I give it 2 at the most."
2,"Good, for a while","When we first got our VCR, it was easy to set up, and came with a detailed instruction manual. The VCR had good picture quality and was easy to use. However, after about a year, it began to mess up the first fifteen minutes of my tapes. I learned to live with it. Then, about 5 months afterwards, it started to play the beginning of a tape and got stuck. The tape could not be played, rewinded, fastforwarded, or ejected. Now we will have to get it fixed or get a new VCR. I will not be able to tape a major sports event while I am on vacation next week. This VCR is good in the short term, but not very durable in the long term."
4,its a good value,"the remote control is kind of awkward shaped, but overall good value for a VCR. plays tapes smoothly and has lots of nice features for the low price. and i got to admit its getting better, its getting better all the time!"
4,Great book,"My boyfriend and went through this book together. Some of the topics are more for singles looking to date - but overall it has some GREAT topics to think about and discuss when you are in a dating relationship. Clear, easy to read, and thought provoking. Great book!"
2,Once you've read the best...,"There are some points to ponder in this writing. Do I think it is enough to change my life? Not really. Not enough depth. But, if you are seeking more depth and roots of getting it right and want to be challenged along the way, I highly recommend ""Why Singles are not Married & the Married are Single"". The whole thing has to be read to get the blessing! It has a message for everyone in any relationship... especially in the days we live."
2,Seemed pretty superficial,I don't think this book was very applicable to me. It seemed to skim the surface and I couldn't get into it.
5,Great Kids Tambourine,This is a cute tambourine if you're looking for one. I also loved that the mallet was attached so it wouldn't get lost. The sound was good too.
2,This makes a better picture-book than resource.,"The content is sometimes controversial, the index is lousy, and all those lovely photos make it near impossible to skim the contents for a particular tidbit of information."
3,Focus is too much on breeding and not enough on beginning,"This book does not seem basic enough overall for a new hedgie owner. While there is basic information, the focus seems to be more on setting up for breeding than for having pets. The information is not thorough enough to answer all the questions a new owner would have. While it helped me get started, it still left me wondering what to do next."
1,In Muster dialect!,"Well, I didn't expect that the less used variant of Irish and less spoken was used for a popular game, aimed for the absolute beginner.Muster dialect has peculiarities, most of it are in grammar, so that it won't be useful even for those that want take a grasp in Muster dialect.An Ulster or Connaught speaker would have a fairly low point in some games.No explication about lenitions.Which is the use of a game that teaches you only to tell correctly the time in Munster dialect? Perhaps to have a job at the local radio station..."
2,Knights in Kentucky,This book is a history of the Knights of Columbus in Kentucky. It contains the history of the State Council and of each individual council. It is not a general history of the Knights of Columbus.
3,"Joan Crawford Box Set 2 this set isn't as good as the first set, with the exception of, Flamingo Road and, A Woman's Face.","The Joan Crawford Collection, Vol. 2 (A Woman's Face / Flamingo Road / Sadie McKee / Strange Cargo / Torch Song)"
3,Great Set 5 Stars but Box Set gets ZERO!,Warner Bros usually makes good on most box sets and when we buy them you can usually bet you get each film housed in its own keep case. Not the case in this box set. It is a digipack foldout style case that houses the dvds. So I have to buy each title seperatly to get the cool cover art that each film gets when it is releases on its own. Warner bros should know fans want the good cases. and at 14.99 a film that runs about 75.00! GREAT SET WARNER BROS thanks for bleeding the customer who wants the best possible for the DVD release.
2,"5 DVDs in one set, but NOT sold separately !!","The 5 films on this box-set are very good and entertaining, however, I am VERY angry at Warner Bros. for not releasing them separately with no original artwork for each title! This means the customer has to pay $50 for the entire set, instead of having the option to purchasing these movies individually! You call that good service to the customer?? Once again, these so-called big studios are leaving the customer with no options.I find that box sets are cute for the die-hard fans, but I would have preferred to see these movies released separately in their own keep case, the same way Warner did with the first Crawford collection three years ago. Let's hope they don't make the same mistake with future Crawford collection sets!"
4,Joan doing what she did best,"I originally bought this set to have ""A Woman's Face"" in my collection, but found that the rest of the films are just as great. ""Sadie McKee"" ties for my favorite and the others are fantastic as well. These are all ""must-see"" movies for anyone who defines Joan Crawford by her roles in Mildred Pierce, The Women, or her later films. If you haven't seen her when she was young and pretty, you don't know Joan."
4,A Fine Set,"A fine set offering a good cross section of Joan's career. The only clunker in this set would be Torch Song-a rather clunky, odd musical that could have been left out of this set and replaced with something more fitting. Even Johnny Guitar would have been fun for this set. The extras are again on the weak side but afterall we don't buy DVD's for the extras but for the movies themselves, and these movies look pretty good considering their age. On another note, the presentation for this boxed set is great."
4,Very good buy for the price,I enjoyed seeing a lot of the Joan movies that aren't the Blockbusters yet are very good movies!
3,"Good, no tears.","I read reviews that said this would bring tears to my eyes and stop traffic. Good listening, but no tears."
5,LUSH AND PASSIONATE!,"These traditional songs from the Auvergne region of France, arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Canteloube, are so intensely beautiful that when I requested a classical radio station to play some of them, motorists stopped on the highway to phone in their thanks.I first heard a selection of these songs 30 years ago, performed by Anna Moffo, and fell in love with them. It's wonderful to find a complete recording of all 5 series on this 2 CD set, sung by Kiri te Kanawa with enormous talent and verve. Whether the mood is passionate, playful, mocking, tender, mournful or-an emotion few composers have ever captured-helpless with pleasure, these pieces have one thing in common: they are the work of a master orchestrator at the height of his powers, using the fullest resources of the modern orchestra. You will not find more beautiful music than this!"
4,Appealing 2-for-1,"This is a Penguin Guide and Gramophone recommendation, and also one of Dame Kiri's best discs. Unfortunately (and this is why I give it 4 stars not 5) this was one of the early Decca Doubles before they started including texts and translations. This may not bother you, but if it does you can download the texts (although with the Canteloube settings being in heavy Auvergne regional dialect, and Villa-Lobos ones being in Portuguese -not a popular language in classical music- that may not help everyone!). Also worth considering Maria Bayo's Villa Lobos on Erato."
3,'Garage Band Classics' - Various Artists (Simitar),"Decent collection of '60's garage rock staples.But,come on!Ten songs?You record labels can squeeze over seventy minutes of music on a disc now.Should be at least five to ten more tracks here.I mean,some of us are too lazy or busy to step over to change the disc after a measly 26 minutes."
2,read the details,"Hey guys, before you complain about there only being 10 tracks., read the details of the item for sale. It is a cassette and not a CD..."
3,Not for Everyone,I have this album and it's a compulanion of unknown bands. Most of it is pretty interesting with some cuts better than others. The best part of this album is you get to hear beginning bands their first time out.
2,A Mystery for Republicans Only,"This is a reasonably good mystery with a reasonably engaging detective, but I won't be buying any more books by this author. Why?The main character's husband ""curses"" by saying, ""Rats, Bats, and Democrats.""Wow. Way to tell half your audience that they're unwelcome, Ms. Martin. Do you REALLY want half as many people to buy your books? Fine. This reader is walking."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,This product wont stay on the hangers and not made for a small animal which would need an 11 inch wheel. Try the Ware Plastic Flying Saucer instead if you want a cheaper option or upgrade to the Silver Surfer 14 inch wheel. My baby chinchillas LOVE both of those products.
1,Horrible,I got this wheel for CHEAPE price. My Guinea pigs never learned to use it. But when the wheel turned one side of the wheel slipped off slipped off.. Bad quality.
2,Could be better built,"It's a terrific idea! However, everytime my ferrets try to get on it, the wheel falls off the hooks. It's just not made properly."
1,Beard on Pasta,The book itself is good - a classic. The problem was the service from Amazon. I received the incorrect book on both the original and on the followup order. On the third order - placed again placed thru Amazon - I did receive the correct title but it was a paperback instead of the hardcover as ordered.
5,Great film,"Only Hitchcock would be able to direct such a film so perfectly. The plot is, as other reviewers pointed out a propaganda for WWII, nethertheless the storyline is good with diverse characters that develop very well during the film. The photography and directing are superband if you like other Hitchcock films then you should definitely not miss this one"
4,A Classic for a reason,"You know one thing I like about old movies? If they only needed 90 minutes to tell a story, then by gum that's all they filmed.Is clever dialogue a lost art? The story is the story, but why not make some folks witty? You try to be witty in real life, and movie viewers appreciate it on the big screen.You know the formula, of course, but so what? Steinbeck, Hitchcock, and every actor loaded with talent. It's a classic. Pretty damn intense and at least 90% realistic."
5,Character study full of tension,"During World war II, survivirs of a shipwreck pick up a German survivor from a U boat. These 9 people share a lifeboat and lost at sea, they must depend on the German's navigational skills. However, they are involved in a mental poker game. Is the German, who is to lead them to safety actually bluffing them as he takes them to be ""rescued"" by Nazis or is he grateful that they did not leave him at sea to die and, therefore trustworthy? This movie is chilling as the psychological drama develops. There is not a lot of action. Sometimes, what goes on in the recesses of the mind is more chilling than any gory, explicit horror film could possibly be. The setting is the lifeboat and the drama is based upon the interaction of the survivors on that boat. Ralph Belamy is great as a survivor who is injured and has his leg amputated on the boat. Is he safe when left to the mercy of the German? Watch this darkly suspensful movie and find out."
5,Great Hitchcock,"96 minutes in a smallish boat. Who else but Alfred Hitchcock? And Tallulah trying to be glamorous, even after dropping her lipstick overboard!! And William Bendix, for us baby boomers, before he became Babe Ruth or Reilly. This is a great movie gem. It has a great villian with Slezak as the German sailor, or is he just a sailor? The interaction between the people in the boat should be a required viewing for today's TV ""survivors"". This is just a great movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon or any day when you called in ""sick."""
3,HITCHCOCK DIRECTS A TERRIFIC STEINBECK STORY,"Cleverly filmed on a single set from a story by John Steinbeck, the final Alfred Hitchcock feature to make it to DVD, 1944's LIFEBOAT is a wartime melodrama that's part allied propaganda and part survival story with a dash of mystery and suspense.A great cast -- Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, John Hodiak and Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee -- make up the lifeboat survivors of a German U-boat attack on a freighter. While they ferret out the true identity of their potentially dangerous prisoner, a rescued German seaman, they take stabs at the ingrained British class system. The overtly scholarly commentary is by Hitchcock specialist Drew Casper."
5,Penetrating sociological study!,Only the masterful abilities of Hitchcok could face and win with this interesting script about a set of shipwreck survivors who will have to wait for the rescue. A journalist and a convinced Nazi will carry the central nervous of the film. If you consider the demanded challenge to film around a boat ninety minutes you will have an approximate idea about what this surpassed goal meant to A.H.One of my ten best favorite films of Hitchock ever!
5,One of the best,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Although it is not one of Hitchcock's well known movies, I do think it is one of his best. Superb acting, writing and of course directing. You will not regret this purchase!"
3,Interesting,It is not my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie but is better than I thought that It would be. You are always trying to figure out who is good and who is bad. It keeps you guessing. I had never heard of it when I rented it but was not disappointed at all after seeing it.
3,Nicely Done!,"I added this one to my collection simply because I wanted to see some of Canada Lee's work. While he was underused here, I did find him to be a nice addition to the cast. I'm glad I finally took the time to watch this film because it was a treat. Smart script, good direction, and good acting by the entire cast makes this one a pure classic. I love how there's no outside clutter with this film, just the actors and their dialogue. I was immediately drawn in. Interesting interaction between these eight people, especially the treatment of Joe, which I did find to be a bit unbelievable given the time period. They don't make films like this anymore. Gee, I forgot about the lady with the baby. That would make it nine people."
4,No wonder Hitchcock was the master,"How anyone could accomplish so much in such a tight space as Hitchcock did in Lifeboat is beyond me. The entire movie takes place in a lifeboat (hence the title) after a ship has been sunk during WWII. One by one the survivors enter the boat and their stories unfold.It has everything you want from a Hitchcock movie; suspense, mystery, intrigue, romance, etc.Some of the acting is a bit lax but that was not uncommon for the time."
3,Sub Par Hitchcock Film,"Alfred Hitchcock drama about a lifeboat full of disparate characters adrift on the seas during WWII is overheated and unhappy throughout. A good cast featuring Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, and Hume Cronyn get stuck playing irritating stereotypes, and the dialogue is equally clichéd. Bankhead keeps too cool a head as famous shutterbug who actually finds romance on the choppy waters, but Walter Slezak steals the show with colorful role as mysterious German on-board. For a much tougher take on a similar scenario, try 1957's ""Abandon Ship""."
2,No movie or refund,Never got movie or refund. Customer Service very prompt to respond but I have never received movie or refund from Movie Mars even after numerous email correspondences. They told me that the movie is probably lost in USPS and that I should try and find it. Then they told me I would be getting a refund (I never got it).
1,Poor quality DVD not as advertised,The DVD would not work in any of my machines. When the DVD was returned I was credited a small amount of what I had paid for it.
4,Lifeboat,Good old WW2 flick about shipwrecked survivors who pull the Nazi captain abord (the lifeboat)that sank them. Based on a Steinbeck story and full of Hitchcock drama. The captain is devious and kills an injured man when everyone is asleep. The captain attempts to lead them into enemy waters but is dealt with when the rest of the survivers find out what he is up to and who he is. The acting is surpurb and full of excellent actors like William Bendix and Tallulah Bankhead and Walter Slezak.
5,"""Man Overboard!""","Walter Slezack and Talluluh Bankhead steal the show in this classic Hitchcock movie. ""People in lifeboats tend to 'act up,'"" as we have seen in the original Titanic with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck and more notably in this wonderful movie. Hitchcock's genius comes through with more artistic subtlety and mysterious beauty than in some of his more blatantly diabolical productions--cresting and falling ocean waves are the backdrop for the rich black and white tones, a microcosm contained within the confines of the lifeboat. Histryonic babblings of the characters are better than any musical score."
4,Hitchcock Classic - Tellulah shines!,"Very enjoyable, classic film. So nice to see such an enthralling storyline developed with great performances by a superb ensemble cast .. and no cgi! The Hitchcock touch and Tellulah's charm are wonderful but Walter Slezak and William Bendix steal the show."
4,Brilliantly done,"I got this video because I wanted to see how Hitchcock managed making a whole movie in one set. I have to say that he pulled it off quite nicely. I wasn't surprised by that since I'd seen rear window but still, in this day and age of 1/4 billion budgets with little or no depth it was nice to see a master at work.Some of the acting was ""dated"" as if they were stage actors - exaggerated. It was overly dramatic at times and almost schmaltzy. But a lot of movies were done that way in 1944."
4,"Good book, but different than I expected","I liked the book, but I felt it had too many of his readings included in it. I thought it would offer more insight into making a connection. This was something that wasn't discussed until the last chapter, followed by an interesting FAQ section. I did find the readings interesting, but I'm not sure if I'd buy more of his books if the subject matter is always centered around his readings. I still did find it easy to read and was intrigued by the book. I just expected more."
5,Amazing!!!,"I really enjoy this book! Actually, this book hit me head on!!! There's so much information that I relate to! I love this book, and I will never let it go!!! James is totally incredible in the life he's lived and the knowledge and information that he shares!!! You won't be sorry that you bought this one!"
1,Show Biz Jazz,Not enough practical advice mixed in with the personal stories about his own success. Not a bad read for what it is but not sure it will give you insights as to how to develop your gift.
2,Not his best,I really loved Talking to Heaven and bought this one on the strength of that book. After finishing it I felt that somehow it had missed its point. I guess like everybody else I was hoping for more insights from the other side. There are suprisingly few in this book at are credible.
2,What is the point?,"I read this book with high hopes. It came with Walking in the Garden of souls by George Anderson. What a sore disappointment it was after reading Anderson's book. This has nothing to do with finding hope or passing on the wisdom of what the spirits has taught him. This is more like a ""be a psychic just like me"" book. I think James has run out of things to say."
3,"Too big, too expensive","Nice design and layout, but its too big for the PDA user. You're better off with a steel business card holder or plastic Pelican cases that are water tight and shock resistant, alas they don't have those nice cubby holes."
4,The Forensics of Dating,"This book is really unusual and interesting: it's written in the form of a series of case-studies that read like episodes of CSI, but are applied to dating. It's a fun way of looking at things, and the whole theme is that you shouldn't be a dating victim but rather an investigator. You can tell just from the table of contents if this book is going to be for you. Like the Case of the Guy Who Couldn't Commit, or the Case of the Boyfriend Who Might be Gay, these situations are either relevant or not. In the end, this was a fun way to read about dating and how to improve without being spoon-fed the usual checklists. The conceit gets a little thin, but not if you don't read it from start to finish, but pick the cases that apply most."
5,Hilarious!,"Just read the chapter on the Missing Boyfriend's Unit and you know that this book is different and usual. I love the glossary and all the terms like ARSE (Anti-Relationship Suspect Examinee) and NERD (National Evidence Relationship Database). I laughed out loud at all the terms and will surely use them in conversation, but hopefully they won't be necessary when I'm on a date!"
2,I should have read,I know I should have read more closely but the picture does not match what you get. Storm watch is a light purple colored tart. Stupid me was looking for a white floating candle not sure why this came up in the search tarts have no wick.
3,A canoe???!!,"I bought two of these little media cases because they would hold 231 CDs - lots of storage for a decent price (plus a free shipping promo). They each came triple boxed (a bit excessive, but recyclable), well packed, and the first went together without a hitch. Then - a major design flaw (for me, anyway) became quite apparent. The two decorative front edge pieces, which give it the ""canoe"" name (right on the box!), are not very practical. Picture an oval shaped opening... edges, wider at top and base, on either side, that extend out over the shelves. If you intend to fill these shelves full of CDs, about 30 of them will be well hidden and rather inaccessible behind those front edges!! Fine for knick-knacks, but not CDs.The second case was put together without those front edges. The now-exposed unfinished side edges are smooth and light enough in color to ignore, as are the small assembly holes (though I may fill them). At least there's now more usable, visible CD space!!!"
3,inaccurate product title,"The product title stated it to be wood. In fact it is pressed particle board with a faux wood laminate finish. The pieces do not all come together tightly and leave open cracks in places. Overall the unit is satisfactory, especially for the price. I was naive to think that it would be a real wood product in relationship to the price, but thought that at least the sides and top/bottom pieces would have been real wood."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"The cabinet looked great in pictures but a very different story once put together. First, the construction is low quality which leaves a very shaky and unstable piece of furniture. I even used wood glue (not included in packaging) and extra screws to help stabilize it but its still somewhat unstable. Second, because of the ""decorative"" side panels, you can't even see anywhere from 5-20 cds per shelf because their hidden behind the decorative piece. I would not recommend this piece if you are looking to fill each shelf with cds. You can instead use it as decoration with a few cds per shelf."
1,These guys need to learn how to ship products!,"I ordered three of these shelves from[...] and each one of them came damaged. Also, the shelves have these decals on them advertising the companies name and if you try to peel them off it rips the fake wood paneling off and ruins the shelf. Plus if you order more than one shelf and then stand them next to each other, the maple color of each shelf doesn't match each other. Lastly, delivery time took forever."
3,Some thoughts on Sensory Integration.....,"This audio tape is a good one as far as it goes...it's an excellent introduction but leaves out much of the underlying theory and basis for understanding this disorder. I would have also preferred to hear a bit more about therapies, and techniques which work to calm and to ""organize"" children who exhibit this difficulty. It leaves one with the feeling that ADD, ADHD and SI are all the same disorder...symptoms may overlap but treatments differ so it is important to know etiology, the ""big picture"" of what is going on. The entire SI pictures is a bigger one than is presented here but this is a good beginning!"
3,A Mixed Bag of Songs,"Anyone who was a dedicated country music fan in the 80's will be familiar with all of these songs, even the ""one hit wonder"" by Teri Gibbs (Somebody's knockin'). The songs were all popular at the time, and I can't really complain about the individual selections, except to say that they don't really create a very cohesive set. I suppose if flow and compatibility of material were important to you, you would not consider purchasing a mixed CD such as this."
3,Fluffy,"This book is very well written but that doesn't disguise the fact that this book is a prime example of a ""puff piece"". There's not a whole lot of substance here, and the author is obviously very much a star struck Sinatra fan. Having said that, the book is entertaining simply because of the subject (Sinatra) and the writing style -- which is very breezy and simple."
2,First of all .....,"First of all, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of Frank Sinatra. Having said that, for the most part this book is a joke. The author clearly wrote a puff piece. This book can be read in 45 minutes - all 236 pages. It is a collection of anecdotes & quotes of famous people who all speak lovingly about Mr. S. Nothing more. I keep it & re-read it every few years because I'm a Frank fan, but there's really nothing there that makes you say ""wow""."
5,Frank rules...........,"I bought this book for my boyfriend. He loves Frank Sinatra. I gave it to him at Christmas along with a fedora (like Frank wears on the cover of the book). He read the whole book on Christmas. He said it was great!""Cock your hat- angles are attitudes""~Frank Sinatra"
1,Boring,"This book was a total bore - couldn't make it past the 3rd or 4th page. While reviewing requires at least 20 words, it's not worth the effort. A jumble of self-serving aggrandizement."
2,The Way You Wear Your Hat:Frank Sinatra and the Lost Art of Livin',"The pictures are black and white, I would have preferred colored photos."
5,With ice,"I got to know the guy, maybe more than he would have liked. Sinatra was many things to many people. Probably the most envied and copied guy in the world. When he says he sang every song, and made every record, because people will be hearing them for a long time- you can appreciate him for what he was. I may never wear my hat the same again."
5,Enlightening and readable,"This book is a wonderful resource for anyone who reads, prays, or sings the psalms. While I am neither a Hebrew scholar nor a theologian, I work with these texts constantly as a musician. Dom Shafer's writing enriches my understanding of the poetry in such a way that my musical understanding of the psalms has been broadened.The psalms are marvels of poetry and prayer. And this book will help you see how that is so. Highly recommended."
3,"Fun, But Not Knee Friendly","This is a fun, fluid workout.. that I will have to give away. There are continuous squats/lunges at the core of the workout that help build your heart rate.. if you have knee problems this one's probably not for you. (I exercise with proper form, but that doesn't fix the missing cartilage in my knees!) I love Ellen Barrett and have a number of her DVDs.. I just wish there had been a clearer description of this workout, so I would not have wasted my money this time."
3,First time working out with Ellen,"I just finished this workout. It felt good and challenging at times but I dont feel like this will give me the results I'm looking for. Not enough focused exercises on the core and too much knee work. She is pleasant to workout with and very clear on her instructions but its too much of a light workout to keep as your main go to dvd. I will use again but im really disappointed, will still have to use Jillian Michaels to get more fat burning."
2,disappointed,"I have never written a review before but I felt to compelled to write one for this video bc I was so disappointed with it. The title is very misleading -there isn't a lot of ""power"" in this video. I found it to be too easy and I'm 4.5 months pregnant. Perhaps i'll use this later on during my pregnancy when I'm too big to do more vigorous exercises."
1,Poor Quality Tapes,"I was impressed with Amazon's fast shipping, but extremely disappointed in the quality of the set of JVCs VHS. On the very first recording, the audio was low, and in some instances, nonexistent. I do not recommend this brand of VHS!"
1,Worthless,This is the first time I have purchased a JVC VHS Tape that was absolutely worthless. All other JVC VHS Tapes I have purchased over the years were excellant quality but not these? The tracking won't hold and the sound and picture are terrible because of this problem!
2,"Still Raining, I think","My sister had always told me to buy recordings that had the DDD rating or at least ADD. It had to do with sound quality, she said. This is the first audio CD I've bought without the the ratings, and now I know why she told me never to buy an urated CD. On this CD, I hear a constant Pshhhhhh, as if the rain were still pounding upon the aluminum patio roof, in the background of every recording. With other types of music, it might be tolerable. However, with The Gymnopedie and Gnossienne, I find this poor qualitiy recording compeletely unacceptable. In addition, and this is only my preference, I feel the two aforementioned works should be played rather slowly, and the way Pascal Roge interprets the music is not to my taste. I think he simply plays too fast. I much prefer Jean-Yves Thibaudet's interpretation of Satie's works. I don't know what to do with this CD. I certainly won't be listening to it again."
2,All Great but Recording Quality,I love everything about this CD but the recording quality. It is noisy for such a quiet piece and the dynamics make it very prone to distortion. At low volume this probably is not that noticeable but if you turn it up at all you get a clear white noise(shhhh or woosh) background noise and as volume on the piano goes up you can get a buzzing distortion. This may not be as bad on various equipment but I did want to warn that this is not the greatest of recordings. It also may be somewhat due to the nature of the music itself but I am looking for a better recording of these fine Satie pieces.
3,The volume setting is weird.,"I like the music but the sound quality. The volume setting is too low. In order to listen to this CD, I have to turn way up, almost twice's higher than average volume that I usually listen."
5,Peaceful & nicely sequenced,"I have had other Satie compilations in the past. In every case, I found the collections unsatisfying, usually because of some obtuse selection that stood out from the others. Not so with THIS compilation! If you want to know where to start if you are curious about Eric Satie, this is the perfect beginning point. If you are familiar with Satie, the sequencing of the pieces sounds perfect. It is an ideal recording to pass a lazy afternoon or twilight. Can't pay a better compliment than that, in my book!"
2,did NOT work for us!,not working for us. molluscum is still spreading. we have been dealing with this for almost 2 years now :(
2,Didn't work for us,"We used this product religiously for several weeks and I don't think it did my daughter any good. We finished the bottle and switched to regular moisturizer. A couple more weeks later, her body finally recognized the molluscum and attacked the bumps - they became very red, but then disappeared soon. If either of my children ever get molluscum again (and I really, really hope they don't!), we will just keep their skin very moisturized and wait for their body's immune system to recognize the bumps to heal them. (Which is what our pediatrician recommended in the first place.)"
1,Waste money,"It didn't work at all.Don't waste your money on this.I've been using for like 3weeks, nothing is better.Do not trust REVIEW."
5,Wenders never ceases to amaze,"I am fairly new to the Wenders world, his school of life and wings. The movie and the book are beautiful. Cinematoraphy/photography tightened into the form of a man's luminescent imagination."
4,Good Short Book For The Early Years,"My 1 year old has enjoyed this book early on. There are some funny typo's with corresponding pictures, but all in all he enjoys it. It is his favorite book and he lights up everytime he sees it."
3,Arthur Goes to Camp (Cloth),"This book gets three stars primarily because we love Arthur. This story, however, seems a little short changed. It appears that the text version cannot due justice to the idea of Arthur finally feeling comfortable at camp. Arthurs change of heart at the end is a little to quick for the kids to process comfortably. The illistrations are wonderful as always."
5,Love Arthur!,"I give every Arthur book 5 stars. These are the first books my daughter really started showing interest in a reading by herself. (just over a year old) She loves reading, but now she's almost 2 and still loves them. She knows them by title and sits through the entire book, sometimes several of them at once. She knows all the characters. They aren't exactly learning books, but they are still really good for kids, in my opinion! Teaches them good life lessons. =)"
1,Mr. Brown's contribution to boy-bashing,"With this book, Mr. Brown has given his modest contribution to the modern ideology of boy-bashing, which, in order to stress how competent and capable girls are, believes it's necessary to state boys are vastly inferior. The girls in this story are depicted as ""great campers"", who ""build campfires, pitch tents, tie knots, identify plants""; the boys as hopeless, worthless bunglers who ""can only find poison ivy"". I am quite supportive of the feminist cause of female emancipation and I'm no friend of the conservative view of women as the weaker sex; but I'm not going to teach my boys they're less worthy or less capable than their female counterparts in the name of avenging past wrongs. I never thought a kids' book could anger me, but this one has done just that."
3,Dvd holder over the door,"They were a little more flimsy than I would have liked for them to be,but, I am using them and they do serve the purpose."
4,Rare Blend - 'Evolution Theory' (TSM),"Although fusion/jazz rock has never been my top favorite genre,I decided to give 'Evolution Theory' a four star rating because of the effort the band had put in to the making this CD.Ten cuts of tightly played and well written adventurous fusion is what the listener(s)get here.Overall,a nice rich sound.Tunes that I thought showed the most promise were the Middle Eastern-ish ""Belly Dancer"",the somewhat tribal ""Fifty Thousand Years"",""Techno Jam"" and ""So Cool"".Rare Blend obviously combines the elements of fusion,electric jazz and world music.Line-up:Vic Samalot-guitar,Bobby Holt-keyboards,vocals and didjeridu,Jeff Scott-bass and Paul Stranahan-drums.Just might appeal to SOME fans of Santana,Savoy Brown and Eric Clapton.Beautiful cover."
3,somewhat helpful,"The book was a good resource for location, amenities and services. the prices were way off. Almost all were higher than the book specified."
5,Hilarious and very talented,"Knowing that these two men not only sing in falsetto, but actually dress the part of rather eccentric Englishwomen from an indeterminate era that could be anytime from the end of World War I to the mid 1970s makes this recording a delight for the ear."
3,Huh?,"A box set of box sets - um, interesting. I consider myself borderline unreasonable in my need to collect music in box sets and even I am wondering who the target audience is for this. Oh, and you can probably buy all of these individually for about half of the total. (For the record, there are some superb sets here)."
2,C-h-e-a-p,"First: the temperature function is for providing the temperature of your arm. You need to (as per instructions) take the watch off and revisit approx. 1/2 hour later to get the temperature of the surrounding environment.Second: after about 2 months use, the stitching holding the watch to the strap started to come apart and now the weaving for the strap is deteriorating.Third: the crystal scratched really easy - I've never experienced that with equally cheap watches.Plus column: setting date, time, etc is extremely easy because a separate screen is accessed through the mode button and you simply use the set and reset buttons to correct the digits.Speaking of digits - you must have the watch directly facing you to see the time; otherwise it is 88:88 o'clock. FYI"
3,An OK little watch,"I've owned this watch for just over a year now. Its on my wrist this very second. The controls aren't very intuitive, so I'd suggest that you hang onto the manual in case you need to use its extra features. But, it does what I needed a watch to do."
1,"Cheap, but crappy","I got a Coleman almost exactly like this one, but not the same kind. It was a blue Coleman 40-266. But every time I went to press a button it beeped. I was unable to turn off the beep because it was not programmed with such a feature. The only button that didn't beep when pressed was the ""light"" button. Also the strap broke at the velcro hook end and I haven't used it since."
4,Does its job,expected it to be slightly biggers. Easy to wash and has a nice finish. Bought 2 to put on both sides of the stove.
4,"Nice looking, roomy, sturdy spoon rest...","Really nice, quality spoon rest with plenty of room for different sized cooking utensils. My only problem with it..and the reason I knocked off a star is..Amazon sent me a damaged one and it's not worth sending back. They really need to practice quality control..I've seen this complaint on many items and seriously wonder if they buy loads of ""seconds"" to make money...? It's a nice spoon rest however, and worth the money."
3,"It's a Good Spoon Rest, but do you really need it?","I bought this before I really started getting into cooking, thinking that it was a good idea to have a spoon rest so the counter doesn't get dirty. But now that I cook a lot, the only thing this thing does is make it so I have one more thing to wash.The item itself is good quality and easy to clean, so if you want a single spoon rest - I would recommend the item. It's also useful if you're making a single pot meal where you really are only using one utensil - then that ONE utensil can rest here."
2,Not A Real Mystery,A disappointment. Don't waste your time or money. More of a presentation of a sad social problem than a mystery.
2,Tired Rhetoric,"I picked up this book expecting a new insight on philosophy; but found it to be a tired, uninsightful repackaging of Aristotle's veiws. If you want a book where a man applauds himself for thinking he has a definitive answer to a science built on shaky ground, thins is your book."
5,"The scholar's ""Messiah""","I am so pleased I purchased this recording. There is a plethora of choices when it comes to ""Messiah"" recordings, and this one is especially interesting to scholars of music history, professional or otherwise. Some of the arias are obviously not the ones you normally hear in concert today, and the liner notes offer a well-written explanation for the changes. The quality of the recording is excellent. The Academy of St. Martin-in-the-fields is always a spot-on ensemble and the singers are excellently trained. My only complaint (and it is particularly nit-picky at that) is the occasional intonation problem in the soprano section of the chorus. But really, it doesn't detract."
5,LONDON VERSION OF 1743 (Early score),"This is not your usual Messaih. It is the first London version of 1743. Therefore several numbers are markedly different from the more familiar versions usually performed today and almost incised upon our memories and minds. There are cuts, additions and scorings for different voices. The Bass air no. 6 lacks the alto section. The usual duet no. 20 for Alto and Soprano, ( He shall feed his flock) is here only as an Alto aria, etc. There are many other variations and cuts and additions with respect to the usual presently performed versions. For my tastes the Christie recording (on Harmonia Mundi) is the definitive version (for the soloists)(on period instruments), along with the Parrott/ Taverner choir version on Virgin (for the overall well-balanced and extremely refined interpretation), as well as the Hogwood version (on l'Oiseau Lyre). I would recommended this recording if you are interested in this early version."
2,Wix 42564,This filter has about half the filter media of the stock item. I expected better from Wix.
4,"Accessible, and well suited for smaller teams","The writing style is excellent and flows nicely, suiting a wide range of SCM folks from newbies to old hands. There's a lot of really good advice for small teams, well.Some examples of real-world setups would be nice, as I'd assume it's hard to go from this text directly to concrete details. Additionally, some of the patterns encouraged don't scale well past teams of about 50 developers or when you're dealing with a long-term multi-version piece of software that has folks working on the version 2 but also issuing QFEs, GDRs, and SPs concurrently on the old version and trying to keep them in sync on the new version. Of course, not many folks but MSFT have to do that! Still, making sure that your SCM story will work in servicing is arguably the hardest thing after making sure that you've got something developers can understand and use on a daily basis, and it's something that can really bite you if you do it wrong."
5,Just the book that SCM needed,"One of the most annoying things about Software Configuration Management is the amount of different terms that exist - especially when the refer to the same things! This seminal book helps address this challenge by identifying a set of readily consumable and well defined patterns. If you don't know your code mainline from your active development line, or how developer testing, building and integration are all linked together, then you need to read this book."
5,A must read for every serious software engineer.,I'm a senior software engineer currently working inthe UK. Some time ago days I searched the internetto find some information about configuration managementin order to prepare an internal seminar for somecolleagues. I needed something easily explained thatcould be used as a base to prepare a seminar forbeginners.Among other documents I came across the last public draft ofthis book. I've read it from cover to cover and I'veto say that is an excellent source of readily usableinformation.The patterns can be used in the same orderthey are exposed to solve the most common SCM problems.So I've used it as the main source ofinformation for the preparation of the seminar.All in all is really an excellent book really useful for beginners and experts as well.I think it will soon become a must read for every serioussoftware engineer.
5,The new SCM Bible,"I just started reading it and I find myself using it as a reference book already.Example: I had a code freeze and new baseline kick off meeting and wanted to provide some external/official source (not my own) to the management team as to what a codeine is and why we need to create a policy document for both the frozen and the new code lines. I remembered reading your book and how it was arranged by SCM concepts and explained each concept in a way that managers could understand it. I looked it up and printed select pages for the meeting. It worked great! Hope I did not violate any copyright laws. :^)I think you have just created the new ""SCM Bible"" that will be the new standard and reference manual to SCM'ers and software development professionals for yeas and years to come!!JEff FaistSCM ConsultantGolden Co."
5,Mileage working with software development teams,"Objective, clear and simple. War stories told by a intellectually savvy trooper are not complex. They tell us about complex scenarios in a simple way. Field experience. It's what this book is all about. Not about procedures, but practices based on well known, or not so, patterns, for you to use with your teams to win your battles. It's up to you. Think about them. Use them wisely.Sorry for the military metaphor but seemed to me appropriate."
4,A very good primer,"This book provides a good starting point for basic configuration management techniques. As it defines a pattern language, it is easy to read and easy to come back to for specific references once you've read through all of it.However, two things prevent me from giving this book a 5-star rating:1) The authors focus almost exclusively on source code version control. There is much more to configuration management than version control2) The book is rather dated. Perhaps a new edition is due with some updates and comments on, for example, distributed version control systems - a lot has certainly changed there and I would reckon the authors have positions about thatIn short, a good introductory book. Check out Continuous Delivery and its bibliography for more in-depth coverage of the subject."
4,The Downings 1971,"11 tracks: Redemption draweth nigh, because he loved me, I find no fault in him, the end was the beginning, I've got confidence, One more time. Bridge over Troubled water, The blood will never lose its power, If that isn't love, the broken vessel, The healer of broken hearts."
3,Great Book - Wrong Version,"Les Pinter did a great job of writing this book, but with the advent of VS2005 and SQL2005, all of the examples and screen shots have changed. Some are minor, but many are not.If you have VS2003 or older and SQL2003 or older, the book can be really hard to follow.Nothing against Mr. Pinter. His book is just a victim of the rapidly changing pace of technology."
3,COULD'VE BEEN BETTER,"This video didn't [stink], but it proves that the people involvedin XPW prove that they don't really understand what wrestling isall about. There's not enough variety for my taste. The openingmatch where Excaliber and Super Dragon fought Ultrataro andSun was a good cruiserweight match, and the rest was just OK. Theguys needed to be trained better before having a match, so theywouldn't have to rely on the weapons so much. If you likehardcore wrestling a whole lot, you should buy this tape. Ifyou're a super wrestling fan, there's just not enough variety."
5,Wow!,"I first heard about these two very talented songwriters/singers during an interview on NPR's Morning Edition. I thought I'd buy the CD after they played two of the tracks from it. I haven't been disappointed. In fact, I listen to it every day at work and plan to purchase the rest of their CD's. They are so good that it is hard to believe that these recordings are live performances. Great lyrics, amazing harmony, solid tunes."
4,Classic Toho Production,"This film was originally released in the states in the summer of 1970. It played on a double bill with Monster Zero. I saw it in a drive-in theater on my ninth birthday...still the best birthday presant I've ever recieved. I love japanese monster movies and War of the Garantuas is my personal favorite. Like its co-feature it was produced in 1966 by Toho Studios. Directed by Inoshiro Honda and scored by Akira Ifukebe, the men responsible for all the great japanese Sci-Fi films of the 50's and 60's, War of the Gargantuas is the scariest and most exciting of them all! Shot in Toho Scope this film can only be appreciated in widescreen.....so steer clear of all the cheap DVD products out there...get the japanese disc....This film is highly regarded in Japan."
4,War Of The Gargantuas,"This movie maybe 40 yrs old , but I got to say it was just as I remembered it to be.I thought of it to be 1 of my most favorable and definitely my most memberable. Honestly when I started watching it all those memories came flooding back of that time in my life just a kid.Memories of other movies of that day and age,Godzilla,Frankenstein ,Werewolf,King Kong and to many more to mention.If you were a kid in that era and those movies as well as War of the Gargantuas strikes a chord,then you know what I am talking about"
1,Riddled with mistakes!!!,"PLEASE SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!Yes, this book address the 2-day lab. But, I bought any way, figuring any lab work was beneficial. WRONG! I am half way through this book and I am finding it riddled with typos, mistakes, and poor editting. The labs are rather basic, if you can make it through the errors. Perhaps the authors should read Doyle's TCP/IP for a refresher on redistributing classful and classless routing protocols! I am forcing my way through, only because I hate to waste the money! DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,Not Challenging Enough,"I passed the lab in March of 2003. I could only suggest the book to those just starting their studies. For those just about ready to go to the lab, let's say with 3 months to go before lab date, this won't be of much help. Practice labs need to be HARDER than the CCIE Lab.If you are going to spend your time going for the CCIE, you MAY (I repeat MAY) want to start with this one, but review it to make sure they have changed the technologies! As of the last writing which I own, it's outdated.Out of all of the time I spent on the CCIE preperation, I used this about 1% of my total study time. I guess that sums it up."
2,Not useful for working along,Please be careful if you're buying this book to work along with. The amount of equipment needed to setup these scenarios is staggering.
3,Better than their last book,"This book is definitely better quality than their last book. The value of the book is extremely good, but the complexity is still not even close to the labs from ccbootcamp."
1,What the hell?,"What is wrong with all these reviewers? Rather, what is wrong with these writers? This is *not* CCIE quality material! There are topics in this book they *attempted* to discuss that aren't even included on the exam. Hasn't anyone learned from these guys' previous books that they're all bunk?You want to get serious about getting a CCIE, then don't waste your time on this drivel. Cisco Press's Routing TCP/IP, Cisco Lan Switching, Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated, Pearlman's Interconnections: those are serious books.I can't believe people think this book deserves more than one star. I mean, what the hell? The writer's barely know the material themselves!"
2,Book is TOO EASY!,This book is for CCNP level. CCIEs will think the labs in this book are a joke. The solie book and ccbootcamp.com have much better labs than these.
5,Great Liszt compilation,"Bolet's finest moments on this two-fer are the Schubert-Liszt transcriptions - you'd almost think 'Who needs a voice?' But he's equally good in the aforementioned Mephisto Waltz, and the operatic journey through Mozart's Don Giovanni.The cons are here too: Bolet's RCA Liszt recital has better, less cautious versions of Liebestraum, Un sospiro and Funerailles. The Sonata is tremendous overall but in the end I'd rank it just a little below the best - particularly Brendel, Richter and Arrau. Yet all these renditions have great merits - even the ones Bolet surpassed himself. This Liszt compilation is overall very good."
5,¡Excelente!!!!,"Excelente compilación de obras para piano de Liszt. La ejecución de las mismas por parte de Jorge Bolet impecable, dos discos compactos (CD) para disfrutar de los sonidos fantásticos propios de las obras de Liszt.La ejecución de las mismas por parte de Jorge Bolet es impecable y la grabación del disco es muy buena."
5,what you need to know,this book really sets you up with the information you need to know about funding. it's nice that there is an example of a grant in the book to help you understand exactly what you need.
5,Shaking the Money Tree,"Warshawski's book is an indispensable guide to understanding the world of non-profit funding. It should be required reading for every documentary filmmaker. I particularly like the ""Sample Grant"" section and the fact that the book gives the grant seeker specific techniques for approaching foundations."
5,"*The* reference for this stuff, but it's poorly indexed","This is *the* reference for symmetric functions and related topics. The second edition is greatly expanded, including (among other things) valuable material on Macdonald polynomials (though the author modestly does not refer to them by this term). The exposition is clean and to the point, as we have come to expect of Macdonald. The only defect of the book is that it can be hard to find things in it. The index is much too short, and much of the material is presented in long lists of disconnected ""examples"" that are very hard to search through quickly."
4,Another keeper,"The House of Winslow has had some fascinating stories. Though they've spent quite some time in the WWII era, it's still a good story. There are some slow sections, but learning about Tyler's failures and eventual triumphs is still neat. Jolie's interesting too, though I think they already used that name in a previous book, (it's still a cool name).So what do we have? We have some orphans, a handsome Winslow, and a French doctor-chick who're running all over France....what could go wrong?"
4,"Serious about improving negotiation skills, read this!","Stephen Kozicki delivers an easy to follow lesson in improving one's negotiation skills. While at times, it may seem a bit oversimplified; the message is clear. The versatility of his proven techniques can be applied to virtually any industry or any business negotiation. His success as a negoitiator is apparent in reading this book. He passes the information to the reader in a manner, in which, one may immediately begin to utilize the techniques and see improvements."
3,Content in book does not live up to title of book.,"Prepare, Prepare, Prepare is the theme of this book and one of the underlying disciplines of negotiations.Author Stephen Kozicki's real-world examples and affiliations with major corporations and governments validates his proficiency in domestic and international trade and negotiations.Mature effort by Stephen Kozicki on the subject, although in my judgment I don't think this piece manifest itself as one of his best yet. I will have to float this one to the next person. No need to make space for this one on the bookshelf."
4,Correction,"Please do not be misled by previous reviews. These recordings were made in December, 1962. Pete Best was let go in August, 1962, and Stuart Sutcliffe died in April of '62. The Beatles at these recordings were John, Paul, George and Ringo. If anyone wants to hear Pete's drumming, I suggest the Decca Sessions, which are now widely available."
3,Where are all of the songs?,"Over the years I have bought a few Star Club LP's and CD's. I was disappointed a number of songs were not included on this release such as ""Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry Over You"". This new issue only has 24 tracks compared to 32 on some others."
4,The title is a bit misleading..read on,"I was fooled by the title...and stand corrected....the review I previously wrote and deleted ..was for the original Star Club CD and not this current selection.For those of you who possess an insatible lust for early Beatles live recordings consisting of the famous lineup...this would be your jackpot....the earliest known recordings with ringo on drums and Paul playing bass...back at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany...where The Beatles had paid their dues in their early days with Stu Sutcliffe and Pete Best.The nice thing is...these recordings have been cleaned up and remastered (there is only so much you can do with a mono tape recorded from the back of a packed bar). On the upside...you get to hear what the band actually sounded like in the earliest known stage of Beatlemania. I gave the rating 4 stars...for the fact the TITLE is misleading....On the downside..in case you're seeking the original ""Lingasong"" version...this isn't it."
2,Not the best version but readily available,I have 4 CD versions of these recordings and 2 record recordings in search of the best sounding copy. This was the worst sounding so far. The content is great and worth it if you can't find another CD of the this show. If you already have a similiar one then save your money. Maybe someday they will get the original recording and remaster it with the latest and greatest mastering technology.
2,too little too late,"Yet again we're being fed an incomplete concert, so getting this for 'better sound' is hardly an excuse to encourage such half hearted attempts. If you consult your 810 Guide you would see 34 tracks listed for this 'concert' or in reality multi combinations of tape. We still aren't getting the whole thing so why bother? Hardcore collectors have already tracked down the complete set in as good of sound quality as we are likely to ever have it.If you've never heard it, we it is a classic piece of the Beatles canon so can't say you shouldn't buy this but there are possible sources which are more complete."
5,Reflection of yourself in this book,"I must say I don't understand the other negative reviews. I found this book to be absolutely wonderful. Gary and Linda tackle the seeds of addictive behaviors, be it food, alcohol, drugs or sex. They also tackle issues such as perfectionism and work-aholism as well as others. I love the gentleness with which this book presents itself. It is not a book that you quickly read through and/or skim along. You need to read a section and actually think about what is stated to receive the full and rich benefits. Yes, it is written in a simple language and does repeat certain concepts; however, the concept is written to further stress that we need to look inward rather than be constantly reactive to our outside stressors. It offers yet another way of looking at our emotions by focusing on the energy of them and where that energy is released in our bodies. It also offers more seeds of self reflection. I loved this book and will recommend it to others whole-heartedly."
2,"Repetitive, frustratingly incomplete and possibly dangerous","I'm currently doing extensive research, both professionally and personally, on soul and its implications, especially in a business context. Zukav's book looked interesting and relevant, but turned out to be repetitive and frustratingly incomplete. Its basic theme is a useful rework of the well-known seven-chakras model, linking physical sensation and thoughts to each of the seven centres. There's enormous emphasis, and much advice, on exploring emotional pain, seen from many different angles, such as anger and addiction; but almost nothing about what to do with that pain, and only the most cursory references to exploring the healthy side of one's inner landscape - which is equally important. In that sense, by leading readers into intense emotional space but leaving them dangling without adequate tools or positive models, the book could be downright dangerous. Interesting, and useful in some cases, but not to be recommended."
3,Awareness is not enough,"The basic message is that emotional awareness is a fundamental step on the path to personal power. Our great difficulty lies in the fact that we do not really want to experience our emotions because they are just too hard to take. Zukav and Francis explain how to work with our seven bodily energy centers to identify the source of bodily and emotional pain.While The Heart of the Soul teaches how to do a quick bodily scan so that blocked emotional energy can be more easily perceived, we are not really told how to work with, change, or transcend our emotions. This is a great frustration for the reader. It's sort of like reading a book that tells the virtures of physical fitness but doesn't tell you how to get fit.That said, Zukav and Francis do a great service by drawing our attention to emotional weakness. They also link emotional maturity to spiritual growth in a way that makes sense. (The Spiritual Reviewer)"
2,Be gentle with yourself,"I found the material to be fascinating, an interesting approach to life. After reading the Graves' review, I would have to agree. I listened to the audiobook, I will certainly do more inquiry in this area, but I found Zukav and Francis' presentation to be somewhat judgemental and abrupt. They should have hired someone with a more compassionate voice to do the reading. In order to really be able to use the information, one must have a good background in personal transformation and self reflection to begin with. Be gentle with yourself."
1,Disappointing,"I have to agree with the author's premise that we need to have awareness and responsibility for our emotions, but decided to put the book down when I read ""You might think that your sorrow comes from the death of a friend, but it does not. It comes from the energy leaving your system in fear and doubt."" And just how is energy supposed to leave my system after a loss? What good does that statement do anyone? I'm grieving, not because I lost someone but because I'm moving my energy incorrectly. I hope anyone seriously thinking about buying this book reads all the reviews. I happen to be listening to The Art of Mindful Living by Thich Nhat Hanh and find it much more useful."
1,Too Simplistic and Repetitive,"I wish I had read the reviews below before I purchased the book. I really WANTED to like it, learn from it. Unfortunately, the ideas are so simplistic they could have been presented in three or four pages. They just get repeated over and over, in bold, with pictures. It made me feel as if the authors assumed that their readers were complete idiots and had to be hit over the head with a concept to ""get it"". Not a good way to win the hearts and minds of the reading public."
5,Expanding emotional awareness. Excellent material!,"Gary presents in his usual clear and penetrating style, the importance of increasing emotional awareness as a necessary part of our spiritual growth and evolution. There is a good degree of depth to this material. A good follow-on to ""Seat of the Soul."" Gary discusses how our attempts to suppress our underlying pain are at the root of many difficulties we experience and create for ourselves. The audio book gives you a chance to hear Gary's inflections as well as input from Linda. This is worth listening to (and reading). Highly recommended. -- Mark Greenia, author of ""Energy Dynamics."""
1,Do some research Gary!,"Although this book surely has some good stuff to offer, with all due respect, it is a painful divergence from the well researched and intelligent works such as Dancing Wu Li Masters. Although it does extend the perspectives of the Seat of The Soul, it largely misses the boat on actually dealling with the source of emotions. It leaves the reader burdened with intense bodily attunement and perhaps riddled with guilt about not ""releasing their energy properly"" yet without any effective corrective tools. If Gary is to act as a public authority ..., taking the time to investigate the emotion literature would be the authentically empowered thing to do. Works like this simply muddy the waters. The high price of fame and publication deadlines are also readily apparent. The repetition is excrutiating."
2,Dribble,"This book is so full of dribble it is hard to get through. I know there are gems of wisdom imbedded in there somewhere, but to get through the dribble to find them is painful to say the least."
2,The world is not perfect,"I have read parts of this book and I am somewhat disappointed. The chapter about perfectinism argues that the world is perfect and that all choices will lead to perfect consequences. The book also argues that the root of emotions doesn't lie in the interaction with other people and the situation. In my opinion, it is true that emotions are caused by our energy system, but there is also a reationship with external factors. The theme of this book is that we can only change ourselves, and not external factors, but this is not the truth. Gary's and Linda's work is nice if seen from a pure spiritual perspective, but it is far from the truth from an earthly perspective."
4,Worthy of Consideration,"I purchased this book and three others while helping a fifth grader prepare for the ISEE. I particularly like the Kaplan because it includes tests for lower, middle and upper levels of the test. The same treatment is given the SSAT.Plenty of practice is provided here. When we had exhausted the content for the lower level ISEE, we used some of the SSAT materials and also some of the ISEE material for the middle level.This is a helpful book with plenty of practice activities and thorough explanations of both tests."
1,Bag broke after only one day,"I purchased this bag to use for my daily train/subway commute. After one day of use the stitching at the top of the bag that connected the upper loop and the arm straps started ripping apart. By the end of the day one end of the loop was completely detached. I did not put the bag under undue stress or overpack it with too much stuff. Needless to say, I returned it immediately for a full refund. The quality of workmanship was clearly unacceptable."
2,Not so large!,"The bag is pretty and good quality leather. However, not as big as I had thought it would be. The bag is small, and doesn't hold a lot, not even say a weekend's worth of clothes and accessories. I bought my wife a smaller version of this bag and she uses it as a carry all pocket book!"
1,"If its performance you want, this isn't it!!!","The demo played great on my system, so without much thought I bought the game. Big mistake, I am unable to play much of the game due to lack of playability because of poor performance. I meet all of the sytem requirements by leaps and bounds, but because of poor support from Activision and depths of the problems the game came shipped with I would wait before you buy. I am hoping this is merely a WIndows XP issue with the game engine and a patch will fix it, so hopefully Activision can get on the ball and get it done. I should have bought Battlefield 1942."
1,"Great Game, Bad Price","I love this game and I would recommend it to anyone, but the price is awful. This is a great strategy game involving Medival Europe. It is historically accurate and very entertaining. However, I have found this game at other stores for much less. I would tell anyone to look around and find a better deal. DO NOT BUY IT HERE!"
1,good game but too buggy...be careful,"of course the right rating would be 3 stars if the game works, but unfortunally this is the only game i've tried that crashes every 5 minutes...and there is no software or hardware upgrade (at the moment) that can eliminate the problem...And this is a ""relaxing product"" for just 50 euro...be careful"
4,Worth every cent,"You can zoom in close enough to see the hand to hand combat as if you are standing on the sidelines!The general leading the army has a huge affect on the outcome of a battle. His position on the field, his rank(king,prince,govenor,or reg.general) compared to other generals, and the type of unit he controls, all come into play.I've had this game from day one and there are many things i haven't done yet. It's just that big. I'm not going to write a novel like the other reviewer did, but it's hard not to.Again, if you like the medieval period, supreme rule, intrigue, bodies laying everywhere after a huge battle etc... This is the game for you. Good job!I gave 4 stars only because there are'nt any cut scences for assasinations or glorious achievments like on Shogun Total War(if it is, i can't find them). Otherwise it's solid."
4,Maybe I'm just hard to please.,"I loved Shogun and I really looked forward to this one. It is a chance to use the system that worked well for Japanese warfare in an historical setting closer to home (for me).The only problems I have with the game are with the strategic map. I cannot seem to stop rebellion no matter how hard I try. All the things that a player should do I have done. Still rebellion. The loyalty of my provinces are well above 100%, and STILL rebellion.On the positive side, you get to use all kinds of cool units. For example, although they are completely useless in battle, directing your cannons at the enemy is professional-dodgeball-league level of entertainment.The way the creators weave history into the game (with actual bonuses and penalties associated) is truly fascinating. Shogun made me want to purchase this and this makes me feel good about going out to get the expansion pac."
4,Two fair sub-games make for one good game.,"This game consists of two games. First there is the 2-d turn-based strategy part which is somewhat like Civilization 1 where you move armies from one region to another, develop technology, build things, train troops, manage money, deal with other factions (countries), and use spies, inquisitors and the like. The other game is an impressive 3-d battle game often featuring over 1000 figures where battles started in the turn based game are resolved. Those battles a very cool for a while. I have not played the multiplayer game (which I think is just a battle)."
5,Best Game of the Year,"This game is the best I have played in months. I am a serious gamer and I love historical games like Age of Empires 2, but this is ultimate. This game combines a super complex awesome risklike gameplay and the best battle system I have every seen. Some people have said that this game does not work well on laptops. Well guess what, the reason is that this is a BIG game. I mean it takes almost two gigabytes of disk space. Most older laptops don't even have that much on their computer. Basically, look at the memory requirments first. This is a game that will take a long time to get old."
4,Longbowmen,"WOw more can I say. You get to use longbowmen in battle.Medieval Total War is one of the most realistic high tactical games ever. Other games use individual people on a battlefield. In MTW, you get to use armies and regiments in formation which you can coordinate as a whole. The detail is incredible.However, the strategic element is a little disappointing. Apart from a tedious click job of emissaries and princesses. You can't bargin/threaten with your allies and enemies. You should at least be able to trade territories and help to coordinate trade or start new trading routes. However, in this game, if you are too successful everyone hates you and refuses to ally or partner with you. <...just like today?>"
1,It does not run,I enormously enjoyed Shogun. Unluckily Medieval does not run (i.e. I cannot start a campaign). Furthermore Activision support told me that they are never going to support my PC (a Dell Latitude with 256 Mbyte of RAM). An advice: don't buy it if you are not sure that Activision supports your PC
1,Video card problems,"I really loved the Shogun games, and Medieval looks like it could be a major time sucker. However, I'm running a 2-year-old Windows 98 machine with an integrated Intel video card, and this game won't run on it, even though every other game I own works fine, including recent graphics-heavy titles like Freedom Force ..."
2,Collecting Dust with Empire Earth,"M:TW sounded great in the beginning and I waited for the price to come down. I bought it a few months back and was bored with it after only a week. The AI was lousy and, as other reviewers have pointed out, cheats constantly. And silly things like the never ending ""new improved Pope"" that keeps sprouting up like a bad weed on your terazzo patio. Yes, it is in the context of ""history"" but the AI just keeps doing the same thing. Sort of annoying.And I didn't get the battle scenes everyone was raving about - it was very disappointing. It reminded me of a game I used to play called ""Art of War"" when armies would sort of shuffle at each other and pluck each other down with arrows. For the uninitiated, that game was played with MS DOS. Point being, the graphics were pretty lame.So, my M:TW copy is collecting dust right next to my other waste of money, Empire Earth. I am still playing Age of Empires II and it just never gets dull."
5,At the TOP of my list.,"You are the leader of a nation to conquer the world. You decide where to spend your money, you decide who will be your allies and enemies, you decide how to treat your civilians, and you decide how to attack and defend with your army, which you have created within minutes, yet years have since passed. You send your daughter out to marry some bum you've never met before out of greed and security, you order assassins to kill the leaders of the intimidating army, and you order a troop of cavalry to hide in the trees only to await the perfect time to surprise the enemy from behind. If you like strategy and control...If you want to play a different game other than those Age of Empires and Warcraft like renditions, this is perfect for you. You will not be disappointed whatsoever."
3,Technique gets in the way,"I was overjoyed to find a CD with my two favorite piano compositions and did not hesitiate to order it ( off Amazon). I had never heard of Mustonen and still have no other knowledge of him save what I know from this disc. I must say that I listened again today to the disc and still feel that Mr. M has disappointed me. While noone could say that he is not endowed with great technical prowess, I repeatedly was irritated with his overuse of a certain staccato technique. WHile a novel sound and probably very difficult to produce this effect did not enchant me as much as it seems to enchant Mr. M. I found myself, throughout the disc, distracted by his playing instead of carried by the music. Still, these are two incredible works and there is some good work by the pianist, when he backs off and plays more lyrically. I strongly recommend the pieces but not the disc."
1,I got an old batch.,"I ordered two boxes, one of them the expiration date is only three weeks away. I am returning this box."
1,Save your money,"After so many reviews i have to agree with the ones that did not liked this book, neither did i. I could not found useful information, it was a waist of money."
1,You gotta be kidding...,"This is just another sorta filipino based knife fighting book... and a bad one, by the way... no ""brazilian knife fighting"" here, folks. The title is just as amusing as the author's nicknames. They're really funny. They could call it ""brazilian knife follies"", that would be funny too. But that's not why the book was written.I wonder why so many people out there try to pass that kind of mishmash as a reality based system ($ perhaps...). You know, many ""masters"" and ""black belts"" NEVER got themselves involved in a real incident involving knives (even when they say the contrary...), as the majority of people who follow them in blind belief. The problem arises when the mud hits the propeller. By that time, it'd be too late to regret.Save your money. There's a few good titles on this subject that can really help you, and this is not one of them. And what you want is to learn a filipino system, look for the real ones, there are many in Amazon.This one is just... funny..."
2,Weak book,"I'm sad in writing a negative review for a book written by fellow brazilian compatriotes. It's a pity that in a country where knife combatives have so few representatives, and almost no literature on the subject, this is the book first published abroad. This book was also published in Brazil under other (less laughable) title. Well, moved by curiosity I bought it, and I regret doing so. As far as I see, the book add nothing to the real seasoned combatent, and is of little or no value to the iniciant as it leads to a false sense of what is a knife combat. All we are left with is hope to see something by Campoi, Albuquerque or Almeida (other brazilian knife experts) outside Brazil in the future. I gave it 2 stars for the sake of this being the first brazilian book on the subject being published outside our homeland."
4,Very comfortable,"I have gone through 2 sets of these seat covers; they are nice looking and they hold you in the seat firmly, providing support. They don't last more than a few months in my case; the material is pseudo-leathery and can tear fairly easily. Also, after many butt-sittings, I found my driver's seat cover shifted to one side eventually and smooshed out of shape. But they look cool!"
2,Loose Fitting,It looks pretty but it does not stay on the sit securely. The elastic on the bottom does not provide a tight fitting. It looks bulky and clumpsy on the seat.
1,Can not really rate it since it never arrived...,"The seller said it ship or that's what they reported to Amazon then a day before the maximum arrival date they send me a e-mail saying they had none in stock and would credit me for it which took 3 weeks and another inquiry to them to track why the credit was not made. As for the product itself it is good I have two cats and the newer cat gets jealous that the older cat gets that dish so I wanted another one so they both would have one, I will have to seek another seller. I have made notes to myself never to buy from the seller that I had all the troubles with. Sighhhhhhhhh..."
2,NOTHING SPECIAL,"I purchased this product last month and was extremely disappointed. I expected something special for the price $$$$, but got nothing better than a store brand generic condtioner. Its ok as far as conditioner goes, but is FAR from the ""Deeeep Conditioning"" it describes. Have since discovered all B&B products are available in my grocery store and I will never purchase again. Debbie Dominy Dublin, GA"
1,Still waiting......,"Well, gee, I wish I would have gotten it. But I still have not, nor have I received a response from the company I purchased it from."
1,Bleh!,"I am actually shocked at how crappy this product is. Left my hair dryer than before I used it. Nothing special, certainly not worth the price. Creme de Coco is better, but sheesh! This was just crap!"
5,Wonderful product for your hair!,"With just one use I saw difference in my hair. It was softer, less frizzy and more managable. My hair texture changed after having my daughter. And I had been looking for a product that would help that and b&b did that for me. I love it."
5,Best deep conditioner out there !!!,"This product is amazing , it makes your hair looks so much healthier , i have really damaged coarse broken hair and this made it so pretty and shinny , this is a must have , though it seems like alot of money for a small tube you don't need that much and if you are running out to quickly it is because your using way to much,"
1,Meh.,"For the price this stuff is crap. I didn't notice a difference at all, and the amount you get will hardly last you 2 weeks. Now if this was about 5 bucks retail, I wouldn't be complaining. Its just a plain conditioner to me. I would compare its quality to that of a five dollar drugstore product. Now if you're one of those people who trick your brain into thinking a product is great just because of the name, or if you walk into starbucks and suddenly become intriguing high class people writing novels (playing solitaire) on your mac computers, then perhaps you might like this too."
1,"Change your formula, lose me as a long time customer!!!","I was the foremost advocate for this product for the last 10 years and my last tube went into my hair like dirt. It didn't distribute, it did nothing for my fine textured hair like it used to. I took it back thinking it was defective and they have me another tube to try. Same thing. I took that back and then they told me they changed their formula.When a woman spends $26.00 on a product, she really loves it. Don't mess with it. I tried to contact the company to get an explanation and couldn't find a way to contact them. Done with you Bumbling Idiots!"
3,IDW have better issues,"This comic was ok but i know that IDW produce better issues then this. Get the spotlight issues, they're better"
2,THE SECOND ONE WAS MUCH BETTER,"This movie was not that bad, but it failed to keep up with the first two. The battle between Pyriel and Danyael wasn't really much of an excitement. The movie did not develop Pyriel's character properly. Prophecy II however was very action-filled and you really get involved. That was the best!"
1,"Why Did They Make this Stuff?,","Okay, I enjoyed the first one, and got through the second one but this one is just kicking a guy in the groin. Walken is reduced to a silly bum and hardly has any screen time. He was so wicked and charismatic in the first two. The plot, if you call a contrived story that, is about some new human that is supposed to fix everything up. The editing is bad, the story is confusing and not even worth our attention and people come and go like an all night bus stop. What was even stupidier that all that was the goth-inspired angel that is the bad guy in here. I was really trembling in my pants as I saw him, gheeze. He was some jerk in long hair with too much bad make-up. If they think about making a fourth one they might want to bother getting a decent director and writer."
3,A FITTING FINALE?,"This is the last chapter in the saga of the second war in heaven. Being a huge fan of the first film, I was a little let down with #2 (there was a scene deleted with a flying winged angel) and #3 started to leave me cold, until the last half-hour or so. The plot should have been much, much better. It was great to cameos from ""Madge"" & ""Mary"". Not nearly enough Walken for me, but his performance is worth viewing this. Like #2, this would have been a bit more interesting with more visions of the angelic battle. As to purchasing it, well... maybe a completist would.Now how about someone making a movie of ""To Reign In Hell"" by Steven Brust?"
1,Pure Crap.,"Viewed: 12/12Rate: 112/12: The WTF moment of the film occurs when Christopher Walken is driving in a convertible car with no windshield (do you know why cars have them, hm?) and trying to play a trumpet. All I can think of is: ""Why is he wasting his time with this trash?"" All in all, Christopher Walken is too good for The Prophecy 3: The Ascent and should have skipped this obviously made-for-TV-that-belongs-in-SyFy-channel dud."
5,The Prophecy 3,"The only problem with this, the last part of ""The Prophecy"" series, Rather the last part with Christopher Walken, is that it was too short. I loved this part better than part 2 and I felt all the characters in it played their parts extremely well."
4,Great!,I loved this movie! I found it far better than the second one and about equal to the excellence of the first. I liked Scott Cleverland as Pyriel in particular! Love them pretty boys!
3,ends the original trilogy on a good note,"in my opinion this final film in the original trilogy is the weakest ofthe three but still not bad.i like what they did with ChristopherWalken's character Gabriel.and Walken himself is great as usual.in facthe's the best thing about the film.i also liked the ending.i thought itwas an appropriate and fitting way to end the original trilogy.ididn't particularly like the main villain.i thought he was just tooordinary and not worthy of the material.i also found this installment abit too preachy for my tastes.overall,the movie was definitelydefinitely not as good as it could have been,but still very watchableand had some good points.for me,The Prophecy 3: The Ascent is a 3/5"
4,Great game,This is the perfect product for card lovers! I got this game for my Mom and she loves it. The monkeys are interesting but it includes free cell which I found is rare for Mac products.
1,Burning Monkey Noisey,"After the first hour the monkey chatter, antics start to pale! Couldn't find a way to shut them off."
2,They stack the decks so it is hard to win...,I like to play a game that is at least winnable. This game does not randomize the deck but rather stacks it hard. I played 20 games and did not win 1 game... I will try to find a MAC solitaire game that at least gives you a shot at winning...
5,Very nice shells,"These shells look really nice, are varied in color/shapes (but they're all natural - no paint!), and the openings are the correct shapes for the crabs (unlike the ones they tried to con me into buying at Petco).The size descriptions were really vague, so I bought four packages, two each of two different sizes. The packages have a sticker put on them saying the specific size range of the shells inside. But not all the packages are the same!For one package of the large shells (the ones this review is for), the size was from 1"" to 1 1/4"". On the other, it was from 1"" to 1 1/2"".For the mediums(Florida Marine Research Hermit Crab Shells Medium 3 pack), the sizes were 3/4"" to 1"" and 1/2"" to 3/4"" (which gave me a very good range of sizes for my crabs to choose from!) It turns out that these were the size I needed.I would certainly recommend these shells, although the medium size is probably better for all but the biggest hermit crabs. The larges are HUGE!"
2,Over priced and one broken,The shells were OK but I received one broken. I wouldn't buy these again. Just go to the pet store and pick out your own.
3,One was broken,I received these today. Both had 1 1/2 inch holes which will work for one of my crabs. My problem is that one had a hole in it and a crack.
4,Fantastic perspective,"As a mother of a 10 year old son in the Autistic spectrum, I find it challenging to understand his feelings. How refreshing to find an author in this spectrum, who can verbalize it for us!"
5,Informative,"Having family and friends with aspergers I found this a very informative and insightful book. Love the writing style, and when I was reading the book I felt as if I were having a conversation with Dr. Grandin. She shares the various issues that those with autism and aspergers encounter as well as their families. And I appreciated the positive tone, since some books on the subject can be so doom and gloom."
4,fascinating,I purchased this book because one of my students with autism wanted to write a biography of Grandin. I ended up reading the entire book myself.
5,Best book I've ever read,"I love this book! I've read it twice and still go back to it from time to time. In one part of the book, the author suggests that basically every person could be rated on a sort of autism-spectrum, with some people at the severely autistic end and others having no autistic characteristics at all. Many people would fall somewhere in the middle. This book isn't intended to be a self-help book. However, I found this book to be extremely helpful because the author's mind seems to work almost exactly like mine! It's great to know that there is someone, somewhere, who understands the way I think. I now have more confidence and do better in school."
5,understanding autism,This book was great on all aspects of autism. To receive a PHD with such a rocky start was really helpful in seeing that it can be done. Hearing about the problems she had growing up with autism was inspiring to know that it can be done.
5,a MUST READ for people in Special Ed,"It is extraordinary how well Temple Grandin can articulate her inner feelings, experiences, and the difficulties she faced growing up in a reality different from her visual world. Her story is an inspiration, and a guide to anyone with curiosity to a better understanding of Austism Spectrum Disorders."
5,A grandmother's review,"As the grandmother of a 7-year-old boy with Autism, I highly recommend this book. Even though I've seen the movie, the book gives a detailed insight into this mysterious neurological disorder. Temple is high-functioning victim of Asperbergers, and although it was written years ago, she updates each chapter. She gives a fascinating look into the minds and bodies of those afflicted with this mysterious spectrum disorder. She gives a voice to those who might not be able to speak."
4,Temple Grandin is an inspiration,"Temple Grandin's ""Thinking in Pictures"", is a must read for anyone who is affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders. Her book is well written and provides a lot of insight into what life is like for a young adult on the spectrum. This has been especially helpful for my husband and I as our first Aspie (we have four) is heading off to college and the ""real"" world. Definitely worth the money."
4,An articulate account of a wordless life.,"As a father of a two year old diagnosed with autism/PDD, I was encouraged and amazed by Ms. Grandin's articulate account of her professional and personal lives. The insights I gained from her book have helped me to relate to, and teach, my daughter more effectively. Her incisive review of treatment modalities carried obvious credibility coming from a person familiar intellectually and personally with this devastating condition."
4,I liked it,"The interesting part for me was getting inside the autistic brain about how they think. For instance, when she wanted to go outside, she would say dog. The reason for this was because the dog would go out. And also, she went on with explaining how and why she became successful in her work because autism is different for those who have it, the part of the brain that is affected. Somee autistics are exceptional in certain areas, such as math, piano players, etc. I found it very insightful and an interesting read. No, i dont know anyone with autism, the subject just interesed me."
5,Hope for helpless mother like me,"After reading a number of ""What is autism?"" books, I still cannot get any reassurance about how my autistic 4-year-old boy faces his future. But this book brings light and hope to me. The author's personal sharing & indepth explaination about what she faced before show me what my boy needs to conquer in his life.I don't know much about the technical terms or scientific stuffs in autism, but I do know that I need to walk with my boy in his developmental path. This book gives me both emotional support and technical information about what I need to know.My husband doesn't like those ""what is autism?"" books (maybe he doesn't like those who want to earn money in this topic) but he does read this one and even discuss with me in details about what our boy may be facing.I highly recommend this book to the parents of autistic kids."
3,A bit one sided,"This is mostly good, well rounded book. However, Dr. Grandin does make some glaring over generalizations, and often seems to assume all autistic people are like herself. While she admits this is not true in place, she will go to the very next paragraph and say something like, ""because all autistic people are visual...,"" when, in fact, some autistic people have severe visual processing difficulties and are not visual at all. While I can relate to most of what she says as an autistic person, I know many who cannot. This kind of misinformaton, combined with her often playing the role of *THE* high0fuctiong adult (who understand all autistic people) is potentially harmful."
4,A Real Eye Opener,Autism is NOT hopeless! This book is an incredible journey into the world of high functioning autistic. The popular notion that most autistic people are mentally retarded is shot down. The book reveals that there are a large number of very successful high functioning and even genius level autistic people out there. The differences in them and how they become successful are well documented. The book is a little disjointed and repetitive. Highly recommended for anyone who knows anyone autistic or who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome (a mild type of autism)
5,It will change the way you think about thinking and feeling.,"I read this book years ago and it has stayed with me, shaping the way I think about how I and others think and view the world. It has helped me personally gain a sense of understanding of people with autism. I have recommended it many times to others."
5,Amazing insight,I have an 11 year old daughter with Asperger's Syndrome. This book has helped me understand her in ways I never thought possible. Little things from the importance of consistent predictable consequences to my daughter's love for animals. I have always thought that Aspergers is a gift and now I am sure it is! Temple Grandin is my hero!
4,Thinking In Pictures,This book provides a wonderful account of how one person with autism views herself and the world. It helped clarify some perceptions I had about people with autism and is a must for service providers.
2,boring,"OMG how boring! I was so disappointed in this book. Clearly Ms. Grandin has no personality and it comes out in this book. She thinks in pictures and goes on and on describing the process via her boring cattle handling designs. I skimmed most of this book, I just did not care. She gives a lot of advice on handling children severely affected by autism, so it might interest some people, but not me."
5,A True look into the life of an autistic individual.,"This is an excellent book! My son is autistic and this book reallly hit home with me. Temple explains what it is like to be an autistic individual. Her writing captivates you as you read. This is an excellent book in understanding what goes on in the mind of someone with autism, but most importantly gives hope!"
4,Interesting...,"An interesting autobiography of an autistic women who has achieved much in her career as a brilliant scientist in animal husbandry, who has designed machinery to make the slaughter of cattle, less terrifying and painful to the animals.She provides insights into autism, but tends to generalize, describing some of her own experiences and conditions, as being general to all autistic, where they are not always so-not all of her generalizations are correct , and the limitation in relationships she ascribes are not true for all who have these disorders.Nonetheless there is valuable information here about autism, as well as milder related disorders such as Aspergers syndrome, and the difficulties these lead to in social lives and careers.She also highlights those who have suffered from such abilities or parts thereof, but have still achieved much, including Albert Einstein, Bill Gates and Vincent Van Gogh.An interesting and insightful book."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS ON AUTISM EVER WRITTEN!,"Anyone connected in any way with autism or Asperger's syndrome - families, professionals, teachers, people with autism and AS themselves - should read this book. Anyone who has ever wondered what it is like to be autistic should read this book. Anyone who doesn't fall into one of the above categories should read this book anyway, and learn something about a world that ""normal"" people never even dream of"
5,Fascinating,"This was one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. My interest in the book stemmed from my work with dogs. I was more interested in what I would learn about animals than humans, but learned a whole lot about both."
4,Must read if you know someone with autism,"Temple Grandin does a great job allowing others to enter her world. The book provides insights that are helping me to better relate to my autistic grandson. Definitely recommend reading if you know someone with autism.Thinking in Pictures (Expanded, Tie-in Edition): My Life with Autism (Vintage)"
3,two-pointedly good (but not great),Enlightening both for insight into how the author's mind works and into animal behavior & motivation.
5,buyer review,"Sent and recieved very quickly, I am very pleased with this seller. I will give a five star rating and will continue to shop with them.Mary"
3,Overly repetitious,"Repetitive, over-generalized, disjointed. Some of it is interesting, yes, but, as another reviewer noted, ""Thinking in Pictures"" could have been condensed into a journal/magazine article."
2,Too technical and repetitive,I'd hoped this book was about Temple Grandin's growing up with autism and how she learned about the disorder and how it affected her life. Although I think it would be a wonderful read for people who work with the autistic or who have someone with autism in their family I found it extremely technical and repetitive. Going back and forth between the different forms of autism and their thinking processes bored me to death. I couldn't finish the book.
2,Book report,"I had purchased this book for a book report I was required to write in Neurology. Although, I had heard of Temple Gradin and her accomplishments and living with Autism, I had never read one of her books. The information in this book was somewhat interesting, however I found it to be very dry and boring. She seemed to ramble about meaningless things that did not pertain to her diagnosis. If I had to chose again, yes I would choose another book."
3,Our Lady of Sligo,"This play is certainly not on par with ""The Steward of Christendom,"" but it has some fine writing nonetheless. Sebastian Barry's works always deserve careful consideration, though they can sometimes be difficult. For me, ""Our Lady of Sligo"" falls into that group."
4,Great Trance CD!!,"The songs on this one are as follows:CD 11) The Spirit - Legend B2) Another Day - Future Breeze3) Keep the Secret - Dune4) Nightingale - DJ Mind-X5) Balla Con Il Ritmo - Cyclone Tracy6) Iron Eden - Gate7) Escape - Kay Cee8) Psycho - Twinax9) Brooklyn - Dream Planet Project10) Infinate - Adventist11) Trance Emotions - USURACD 21) Brainchild - Nostrum2) Rape - Airfire3) Only the Strong - K4) The Way You Talk - Vector Mode5) Will I Dream? - Tibet Team Frankfurt6) Chapter Two - DJ Tiesto7) Eternal Rhapsody - Marino Stephano8) Dream - Lissat & Brain9) Secret Wish - Boccaccio Life10) Flashback 2 - Slotmachine Allstars11) Backfired - Nalin & KaneIf you like Trance, dont miss some of these great songs from the past."
4,You need one traditional Xmas cd - this is it.,"Yes, most of the stuff was originally recorded in the 50's and 60's and it's not going to win prizes for signal to noise ratio. However, if you, like me break out in a sweat hunting for a xmas cd which won't contain some desperate wannabe modernised rehash of carols or a ""listen to me aren't I a good tenor/diva and by the way here are some carols?"" tracks, then this is your album.From the moment track one started, with a belting rendition of ""Hark the Herald Angels"", I had a grin on my face from ear to ear. Warm memories of xmases past flood back, cooking, carols, snow and presents. Yes - dreamily rose-colored, revisionist and traditional it is, but worth every penny in this cynical cyber world."
2,"Ok, but....","I guess I expected the ethereal sounds of heaven that I wanted - but it was just not quite what I thought....I can't say it was bad, just not the deeply moving lovely sounds that I've heard from other albums..."
3,Disappointing,"The songs are lovely, but the quality of the recording is poor. You can hear the hiss of original analog recording and the volume needs to be high to hear the voices clearly."
5,Music for relaxing,"This selection is played on MusicChoice in my cable tv lineup. I wanted to enjoy it in my car, and Amazon had it! :>}"
5,Intriguing,"Someone recommended this book to me and gave it to me as a gift. I was less than thrilled until I started reading the book. I truly enjoyed it, far beyond what I had imagined. Bradley uses a light touch and every page is lifted with Bradley's unique sense of humor. Highly recommended."
3,condition of text,The book I got was a library withdrawn book. I expected a better looking book for the price I paid.
1,bourgeois tripe,"Brad Leithauser is the worst poet I've read in some time. Although there are many more carelessly self-indulgent poets writing, Leithauser is amazingly self-indulgent in terms of content: his poems have no purpose, not even to delight, and they seem simply smug when they do bother to adopt a tone. Thomas M Disch called Leithauser the prom king of American poetry--apparently because of Leithauser's earlier self-aggrandizing--but that description gives Leithauser the advantage of being interesting, which the poems in this book definitely are not."
1,Worthless,"Out of a collection of approximately 30 CDG's, this is the only one including the replacement that doesn't play on my Singing Machine. So this Chartbuster product is worthless to me."
1,Not a happy camper!,"I gave this watch to my husband for Christmas, and today, only 8 days since he opened it up, he told me that the band had already broken. The stitching had come apart. I am very disappointed. I have bought Coleman before and did not have this problem. I did buy the army green color the time before, so I thought I would get this color this time for a change...Wish I had stayed with the other.. Anyway, very sad that my husband is once again without a watch..:( :("
4,"Pretty good, a little frustrating","When the watch was first shipped to me, it looked pretty good as if it would last for a long time. While setting the time and date it was hard to do that because you have to repeatedly hulk-push the buttons to get it to work. It's a pretty good product. I recommend it for others who want a watch."
5,Easy reading and accurate,"I read Dan's last book, ""Open Road's Ireland Guide"", before I took a 22 day trip to Ireland. I found it to be easy reading, but more importantly, accurate! I especially enjoyed the short history chapter. You can not find a better description of Irish history in 20 pages anywhere. His latest book, ""Ireland Guide : Be a Traveler - Not a Tourist"", is even better. I had the opportunity to take it with me on my last trip to Ireland and once again found Dan's suggestions extremely valuable. When your time is valuable don't waste it. A must read for anyone planning to visit Ireland."
2,Too many good places omitted,"Yes, if you have been to Ireland , this book is very user friendly.However, I find it very predictable and not very adventurous.McQuillan lumps Southwestern County Cork into 5 or 6 pages. To me ,that is a terrible dis-service. It is one of the most beautiful andrugged areas in the island. Farther north, Monaghan and Cavan arerelegated to just a few paragraphs. I've been to both counties andthey really should be given more attention. Anyone who has driveninto Monaghan on a busy afternoon will always remember the closenessand narrowness of the market town streets before the town center opensand sets you off in four directions. ...On afair measure, he does provide a well rounded list of places to stayand worthwhile haunts to visit. In that way, yes, it is an adequateguide book--just like most others on the market that in additionprovide maps and other valuable aids for the beginning traveler."
5,Dramactic Climate change doc!,"Scientists expects the planet to warm by as much as 3-10 degrees at our continued rate of temperature rise within the next century. Hydrogen and 0 Point Energy are just some of the solutions to this bleak future predicted by almost all climatologists and scientists? We cant keep waiting for the next generation to fix today's problems! The balance is in our hands! We have the technology to save our future, but do we have the will?Narrated by: Ross Gelbspan, John Hutchison & John Searl"
2,Can you hear me now???,"I had anxiously awaited this discs arrival. I have followed with great interest the work of John Searl. But, I was really disappointed to find that these three interviews were done over the phone. Plus, the whole movie was animated, kind of like a shareware screen-saver. The sound quality, especially with John Searl, was horrendous. It didn't help that there was a synthesizer loop droning through out the 56 minutes. I completely believe that this information needs to get out into the world, but it was too hard to hear the words."
4,nelson wins his first round,"loveable mikey trained hard for this, and it paid off. in his first battle against the worst movies ever, nelson and the bots reduced me to a girly heap of giggling silliness as they showed no mercy against a mother of a movie."
2,"Mike's first episode, but other than that, not noteworthy.","There's just something strange about trying to judge a person's first episode. For some reason, Mike just doesn't seem to have his rhythm down for this one. Although there are some funny jokes in this episode, it just isn't as consistant as some of the others I've seen. Perhaps the movie itself is just so Godawful that it makes things really difficult for everyone on the SOL. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong"
5,best ever,"this or pod people was, next to soem of the shorts, the finnuest episode i ever saw. the first time i watched it i laughed so ahrd i ahd to watch it twice mroe jsut to ehar all the stuff i was busy laughing over the first and second time i watched it"
5,Pure Fun,"If ever I need a good laugh, I watch this. Mike Nelson and friends rip this cheesy film to ribbons. This is my favorite MST3K movie (and I've seen a lot). After experiencing Mike, I find his predecessor Joel listless and not nearly as funny. Mike is so sharp with his sardonic humor and his fantastic pop culture references. Who wouldn't want to watch b-movies with him?There are so many quotable, fun lines throughout this movie, you have to experience it for yourself. This is a highly recommended helping of silliness."
5,The Brain That Would Not Die,"Without a doubt one of if not the funniest MST3K shows. This one simply deals with a woman who loses her head (literally)in a car accident with her fiance. He keeps the severed head, and attempts to find a new body for the girl. How does he do it? There are ways.What makes this movie funny is that the movie is so bad. The movies actual ratting was 1/2 star. Unlike some movies, this has continuous talk, and is easy to make fun of. A must see."
5,Mike's maiden voyage turns out to be a great one!,"""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" was great. Right up there with ""Pod People."" I'm rather partial to Joel, but Mike does a great job on his first try. The head keeps chanting, ""Let me die! Let me die!"" Somebody should have let this movie die before it was dumped on an undeserving world. Through MST3000, it gets a second chance."
4,Good Product and Fast Shipping,"This is a great product and I'm so glad to find it here. It was shipped out to me in good condition, very quickly. There was also lots of other samples in the box to try. Thank you"
4,Good Meat & Potatoes bluesy NWOBHM,"Ok, the above review is ridiculous, as it is an opinion of the cover art, which is actually quite whimsical. This is a good record, one of nwobhm's strongest links to pub band, blues-rock oriented music. It may not be as essential as, say Diamond Head, or Tank; but it is definitely worth a listen if you're interested in this genre, ....and if you can find a copy."
4,Very Good Single Cup Coffee Maker,"Overall, it makes a good single cup of coffee quickly. We had an older one that went out after years of use. Only issue with this one is the lid does not close tightly when brewing unless you place something heavy on it."
5,Great coffee maker,"I bought this to replace a cheap one-cup maker I bought from from one of those junk catalog. This one is very nice looking, it works ultra fast with automatic shut off and I can use my own larger mug instead of the cup which comes with it. If you use a huge mug you may need to add more water. I like the cord on the side. If it was on the back, you couldn't put it up against the wall. Makes no mess and works great!"
1,I do not like this at all !,"Much smaller than I expected.Thought it would provide a single mug of coffee,since it looks like a normal size mug in the picture,but in fact it is a small mug that only provides8oz of fluid. It is only good to fill a tea sized cup.Another dislike I have about it, is that the power cordcomes out of the left side of the coffee maker.Makes it very messy looking with exposed cord.You do not see it in the picture here, but it is infact on the left side."
2,Terrible disappointment,"I originally was given this product as a gift three years ago and use it in my office. I was so pleased I bought a brand new unit for home. The new unit is different and has a serious problem. When it works, it brews a good cup of coffee. But the mysterious thing is that periodically it leaks, so you wind up with half the coffee on the table underneath the coffee maker. There's no way to predict when that will happen. Maybe it's caused by the fact that I use two tablespoons of coffee, and that's more than the designers planned on. But whatever the reason, I can't tolerate it and will not use it again."
5,This is the only product I have ever taken the time to write a review for,Great product for the price. No need to get ripped off using the single use disk coffee products. It makes the coffee quickly and very hot. What else could you ask for????
1,Coffee is not hot,"I received this as a Christmas gift and do not like it. The coffee is not hot at all. I would classify it as warm. Unfortunately, I can't even return it because Brookstone has a 30 day return policy. I didn't even receive it until the 30 days was almost up. I'm not happy with the product and I'm not happy with the return policy."
3,A poorly designed coffee maker!,"I felt sorry that I bought this coffee maker. It made a mess because about half of hot coffee water did not go into the mug or cup. However, I could fix the problem and it seems to be o.k. now. At the bottom of the filter basket there is a short spout. This spout is so short that it let the water to spread out and run out of the cup. I attached a short hose to the spout to make it about 1/4"" longer. This solved the problem."
3,Does what it says,It really only makes one cup of coffee at a time. It meets minimum standards for performance. Can't use some of my larger mugs with it because the resevior only holds a standard mug volume of water. You have to be careful when filling it with water--not much space for error before water spills on the counter. Brews like any standard drip pot. Overall would rate as a C+-B- for satisfaction.
1,This is okay if you like weak coffee,"I bought this for my husband who is the only coffee drinker in the household. He likes his coffee strong and when he would use the amount of coffee he prefers, the coffee maker would overflow and create a mess on the countertop.It is an attractive unit, easy to clean but I would not buy another one."
3,Too restricted,"A nice looking one-cupper. Works well. However, it is designed to use only the cup provided. The cup provided is a little small. My old one-cupper could use most any coffee cup or mug."
1,Disappointing,It worked fine for a short time. Then is began leaking and nothing could get it to stop. Would not buy this one again!
1,Not Worth The Money!,Just like others i've have had this coffee maker for a few months and sure enough it does overflow from time to time. With shipping this cost almost $50. Money you can spend on a better product! I don't want to have worry about having to stand over my coffee maker while it's being brewed just in case it starts to overflow. The other drawback is that you have to use their mug and if you like a big cup of coffee first thing in the morning you will have to do two brews. I got this because I like using my own grinds as well but i'm sure there is a better single cup coffee maker out there then this one. Don't waste your money.
3,My Brookstone Coffee Maker Leaks!,"I really shouldn't complain because this thing made great coffee for me for years. I had two of them: one in the house in stainless like the picture, and an earlier model in black plastic on my boat. The one on the boat never gave me a problem, but the stainless one leaks occasionally and unpredictably. I keep it on the kitchen counter in a plastic storage bin to catch the overflows.Cleaning the spout doesn't solve the problem, so I think I'll have to get rid of it. Unless the problem is that I'm using Senseo coffee pods in the mesh filter rather than ground coffee. Does anybody think that could be the problem?"
2,Just muzak,"Perhaps I misunderstood the whole point of Sony's Organic Style series, but the entire collection is muzak! It sounds as if the tracks were played off a casio keyboard! If you're a big fan of Cagnet, like I am, I would steer clear of this compilation and just purchase the original soundtrack albums."
2,"ok, but nothing special","Overrated, way overrated. Gheorghiu's singing is ok, and the vocal acting is a little above par. However, this was not as great as others say, when I heard for myself. I've heard lots of other violetta's that are just as good, or even better, so what's the deal with this one?"
5,One of the greatest recordings,I have just bought the DVD and the CD. Undoubtly this is one of the greatest recordings with Solti at his highest. I would highly recommend it.
2,"Undistinguished, what's all the fuss?","Georghiu's voice is remarkably similar to, almost the vocal twin of, Cheryl Studer's; both have a bothersome tremolo that borders on braying. Technically, the voice is produced solidly but her vowels vary distractingly from dark to light and back again even on the same word, an unpleasant mannerism. Interpretatively, her Violetta is relentlessly intense and ""dramatic"", over the top with Emotion but lacking light and shade, which we got in abundance from her famous Greco-American predeccessor. Lopardo intones Alfredo with almost preciously clear diction and full tone (albeit with some hoarseness of attack in his Act 2 aria, but it's live so we make allowances for some vocal fatigue) but the characterisation is nothing more than generic. Solti's conducting is curiously reticent for an erstwhile firebrand. The Covent Garden audience is dutifully quiet during the proceedings, which were nothing to rave about anyway."
5,Good and NATURAL!,"Love this stuff.....very expensive, though.Even use it for tooth brushing. No film....no flouride....and cleans great.It is also great for bathing and washing your hands. No chemicals.The ""form factor"" has to be modified for different uses, since it comes in big blocks."
3,Good movie to rent,"I liked this movie when I saw it on dvd some years back but there is no real added value to purchasing the bluray. If you like the movie or have never seen it, watch it on bluray and rent it."
1,2 DISCS...NO DIRECTORS CUT,"I too purchased this 2 disc set this evening awaiting eagerly, the directors cut with 35 extra minutes. What did I get? 2 identical discs of the same thing...the theater version and the unrated version (not the same as the directors cut which was supposed to be on disc 1. Dont get me wrong...this is a great version, but I have 2 other copies of the same movie with one an export. Now I have....4...of the same film. Someone needs to write the company to correct this. I got it at a local store. Anyone get the directors cut from Amazon? Grrrr. Now I am Grouching Tiger."
1,No Director's Cut on my copy,"I had the same problem when I got home--I had the same thing on both discs-- even though the image on the first disc was printed differently, it contained the same Unrated and Theatrical Versions that were on the second disc. I went back to the store--and the same problem existed on the other two copies we tried out. Where's the quality control, Universal?"
1,An issue of quality control...where is the director's cut?,"Let me just start off by saying that this is by no means a review reflective of the actual movie, so much as it is a ""complaint"" about Universal's quality control. Like the other reviewer, I recently bought my copy in a store and got home and popped in both discs looking for the director's cut. All I have to say is that I was sorely disappointed, as both discs contained the theatrical and unrated versions, same bonus features, same menus...same everything. If both discs were the advertised director's cut I think I could deal with that because that was the main attraction here. In all honesty, they should have sold this exclusively as the Director's cut, as I really doubt most people are buying it for the theatrical and unrated versions. I'll be returning mine, but I doubt I'll be exchanging it for another since it's likely that this defect is pretty widespread."
5,Beautiful Picture,I have been looking for this blu-ray for my husband for some time. It hasn't been in any store I have looked and every else online had outrageous prices. I am so happy I looked on Amazon before giving up. We popped it in our PS3 and the picture is absolutely phenomenal. I even ended up watching it with him.
1,Warning!!! No director's Cut!!!!!,This long awaited direcotr's cut of one of my favorite movies was nowhere to be found in my dvd set. I pre-oredered and was extremely upset to find that both discs were of the same versions (NO DIRECTORS CUT!!!) Buyers beware...I hope that universal or somebody can help correct this horrible mistake!
4,Cantonese,"I want to buy this dvd, but the language is Cantonese and what region incoding is it written on?"
5,DVD review,DVD was ordered with overnight delivery. Product arrived ontime and in perfect condition.
2,Bad Previews,"I love Jet Li's Fearless. It is a fantastic movie. However, when they released it to DVD they seem to have felt to insult us as consumers by forcing us to sit through the sexual raunchiness of an American Pie preview.Jet Li's Fearless was a PG-13 action/drama film. American Pie is an R-rated film with strong sexual content. What makes Universal think that their PG-13 action/drama consumers want to be forced to sit through a raunchy sexual preview for an R-rated film?It's absolutely gross and unacceptable."
5,top notch,"This is not only one of Jet Lis best movies of late, but one of his best movies ever. The production values are of very high quality, the choreography amazing and the story is simple without being boring. Jet Li does a good job portraying Huo Yuanjia and the rest of the cast is, in my opinion, also up to par.It definitely brings moral, ethic, valour, honour, and other values in the foreground, but without being preachy. The story, although based on a true story, is quite historically inaccurate, but then again, who takes their history lessons from the cinema?Highly recommendable"
4,More than amazing fight choreography,"This film is a martial arts film, but not a typical one. It does have stunning fight scenes (the opening will leave you breathless), that are fast paced and well thought out. However it isn't all fight scenes, there is a lot of character development with the protaganist (Jet Li). You see him as a child, and this shows how Huo Yuan Jia's adult personality and obsession with victory in martial arts are formed. He will go through an incredible transformation before the film's end and discover the true purpose of martial arts.The story is very effective, and has a good deal of touching moments. Jet Li fits the role well, and like ""Hero"" it shows what a big difference getting to do a part in your mother tongue is. His facial expressions alone tell a lot about the character.Target audience: Anyone in their teens and above who don't mind subtitles and enjoy excellent fight choreograpy."
5,Great Movie Cut Short,"Let me just say that this movie was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of Jet Li's best alongside 'Hero.' My only qualm is the fact that there is no 'Uncut' Version. (Unrated and Uncut are two different things.) The original film was approximately 140 minutes long with scenes with Michelle Yeoh (From 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'Memoirs of a Geisha') and another fight scene with a Thai Boxer. Please, Rogue Pictures, release the 140 minute version for those who truly loved this film!"
1,Poor Quality DVD,"I tried to watch the video last night, and while the HDDVD looked clean, it wouldn't play without green screen, gliches, and the sort. I ended up putting in another HDVDV in because FEARLESS couldn't be watched. Not good. I want a new HDDVD please."
5,WHAT!!!!!,I just got it and not only did i get the directors cut which is 2h22min but also unrated and the theater version
2,A big let down,What a disapointment. It reminded me of the old dubbed for english chinese kung fu movies.Not his best and a poor movie to go out on.The fight scenes where as usual nice to watch but that was all that was good.
2,CLUELESS,"ZZZZZZZZZZZZ What can I say? Been there done that... This movie reminds me of ""Once Upon A Time In China 1,2,and 3"". I just wasn't feeling this movie at all. When it was over, my son and I looked at eachother, and shook our heads in disjust; that's the God's honest truth.I bought this movie based on everyone else's high praise for it, and I feel jipped. I will say this...the fighting scenes were okay, but all the melodramatic talking and the blind woman who helped show him the ""light"" just negated all the good fighting. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
1,Director's cut is truly CUT from this DVD - don't buy from Amazon !,I too ordered this much awaited DVD on day 1 and got the bad copy. Mine does not have the Director's Cut. I played both discs at least 4 times to rule out user error. I am returning it to Amazon and hope they will refund in full.
4,Worthy entertainment,"As a martial arts fan, I had seen Li on film before, and admired his skill and stage presence. I knew nothing of this flick, other than the Amazon plot summary. The film was very satisfying in four respects - 1) the marvelous scenic portrayal of period urban and country Japan; (2) the individuality and credibility of the characters - they seemed like real people; 3) the quality and amount of martial-arts action with a variety of performers; and 4) the focus of the film was on the humanity of, and moral dilemma faced by, the protagonist, rather than on stereotypic good-vs-evil violence so aften found in this genre."
4,"A great movie, but know what your getting.","4 Stars not 5 simply bc If you hate subtitles and hate dubbed movies then you will hate this. Fortunately I love all forms of movies so this was a must have. Excellent fight scenes, a great and moving story. This movie really comes full circle a little over half way through and you get truly roped into it. Until then you are enticed in the fighting sequences. Low price for a great movie."
1,fearless,"I wasn't too happy when I popped in the 2 discs and realized that both were the exact same version: theatrical. I thought I put the same disc in twice, but I checked again and they definitely were the same. It was supposed to be a theatrical version on 1 disc and unrated director's cut on the other with an added opening scene. (look over at the item title. it says unrated director's cut!) I spent more on this than the regular theatrical but only got 2 copies of the same version :("
1,Problem fixed - NOT!,"I bought this DVD on 24 July. It had the free Mummy ticket sticker on the box. Both discs were the same, despite Universal stating they had corrected the problem at the retail level. They did not recall their original shipment and many retailers have still not removed them from their shelves. Unfortunately, there is no real way of knowing what you are getting until you put disc #1 into your player. I would recommend waiting a while longer before purchasing. Hope this helps."
1,Correct DVD received,"I don't know what happened here, but as everyone else is saying, this turned out to be two of the same copies of the previously released dvd. There is no director's cut on here. When I go to the Universal page, and try to go to the contact page on the bottom, I get a 404 error. Rogue Pictures has no contact information that I can see. Has anyone figured out what to do? I couldn't wait to see this!!**8/14/08**Today, after emailing Universal and giving them my incorrect disc, they mailed me back the correct one."
4,Jet Li's Fearless,"Jet Li with a dash of history, nuff said. Lots of Martial arts action, the real impact comes when you find out this is based on a real person."
3,Great fight scenes,"While this movie has great fight scenes, Jet Li's character comes off as a real jackass. Too bad he picked this script to be his last martial arts film."
2,Butchered DVD,The standard DVD is missing much of the comparision fighting that made the climax so dramatic. Without the fight sequence intact the movie fails as it was poorly edited. Don't bother to waste money on this version. The director's cut 2 DVD set is much better.
1,great movie but NO DIRECTOR'S CUT here,"I to have the same problem as everyone else I have exchanged mine twice and its the same thing,no director's cut.Its just the same thing on both discs,the unrated and theatrical realease from the previous dvd release.What ashame how does this happen and how are they going to fix it!"
1,Problem with the XBox360,"This is the second HD DVD that I've had issues with the XBox360 player, the other being Children of Men. Ironically, both are dual format. While Children of Men refused to play, this one refuses to go past chapter 12. I've had no issues with my PS3 playing any of the Blu-Ray movies so it begs the question, what is wrong with this format? I've got another dual format HD DVD/DVD disk that I'm going to try. Anyhoo, if you're using the XBox360 HD DVD player, this movie might not play all the way for you or might not even play at all."
4,A must have,This is an excellent feature. It really gives the whole story much moore depth and understanding.
3,before you buy Jet Li's fearless Director's Cut DVD,"my review is the same as VICENTE ARELLANO's. this DVD is falsely advertised as containing 3 versions of this film over 2 discs. yet it only have the two originally released versions on each disc, basically the two disc have the EXACT same materials on them, minus the version of the film that it highlights. i went to Universal's Home Entertainment website, and the ""contact us"" page inst there, so i kinda gave up after that. quite annoyed."
2,Again no Director's cut!,Like every other reviewer here I was eagerly anticipating watching the DC of this one. I got it at my local Kmart and have already returned one and I'm about to return the other. After reading the other reviews here I see something has gone horribly wrong.
5,A very great actor is revealed,"Jet Li has restrung his bow: He has added to his superb execution of martial arts his equally superb acting. This, in the great Chinese tradition that martial arts are an integral part of acting. With this performance he has taken his place as one of our time's greats."
5,A BEAUTIFUL BIBLE EDITION,"This edition of the Bible is masterfully put together: binding & cover, paper, type and layout, everything about the book itself is worthy of its contents."
3,Stoner rock with cosmic ambitions,"This anonymous power trio plays some inspiring stoner rock. With the trademark tempo shifts, going from the ultra slow to more progressive sounding speed up passages. And while sounding sluggish at times make no mistake, these guys are accomplished musicians.Not much soloing, more a collective effort with inventive bass and drums on equal par with the guitar. The almost exclusively growled vocals deals with astrophysical concepts. Like Vintersorg, but certainly not as convincing and intelligent.Fascinating and uncompromisingly uncommercial, certainly fit for an inner galactic journey. And with some beautiful coverart by an also anonymous artist."
3,"Eminent Talent, Subpar Recording","This is a disappointing album because it could have been so good. Ashkenazy was a brilliant interpreter of Rachmaninoff (or Rachmaninov, potato potahto) and Previn is incapable of boring an audience, even when his interpretations ring a bit false. I was excited to listen to their piano duets, particularly the Fantaisie-tableaux, one of my favorite pieces.The problem is not the pianists, whose harmonics are vivid and pleasurable. The problem is the recording. I felt as if I were listening with a paper bag over my head. I tried switching to headphones, but that didn't help. Either the music was poorly recorded or the analog-digital transfer blurred the music's edges.In any event, something of a disappointment. There are better discs out there for Ashkenazy, Previn, and Rachmaninoff."
3,"Functionally great hubs with low price and easy install, but terrible finish...",Totally agree with above. My hubs are but a few weeks old and a few summer showers have now littered the shiny surfaces with corrosion. The aluminum caps seem to be gravity cast and are presumably porous. The price was great but this was not the place to save money on this product.
4,super easy to turn--I'm not sure I like that fact,"got it quick since it is stocked and sold by amazon, not some drop shipper. call amazon to make sure they have it though as they are hard to find in many places. I have two complaints...actually three. 1) the paper gaskets included in this boxed pair are very cheap and flimsy. mine came torn. I purchased a roll of gasket material and made new ones myself. 2) the turn to lock/unlock is very easy. it doesn't feel secure to be honest. I would love it if it clicked in place. i did lube it, though maybe I overdid it. I am always checking before getting on the road to make sure they are where I left them. 3) this site says it won't fit on a 1997 geo tracker, I called superwinch in connecticut and they told me that indeed it will fit on ALL trackers. call superwinch if any doubt."
4,Wonderful,"Sinclair Ross is a brilliant writer. Although this story deals with a loney preacher and his wife during the depression era the trials they go through are easy to relate to. I would recommend this book to any adult wanting to discover how to really love and forgive. The content matter is a little advanced, so I would suggest it for anyone sixteen or over."
4,Desktop Images Lightwave Model One Tutorial,"The Lightwave 6 modeler is known to be of the most powerful 3D modelers available today. Model One, the first in a series of two Lightwave modeler tutorials, is a basic but necessary addition to a Lightwaver's learning library.

Model Two, the second in the Lightwave 6 series, is also recommended."
2,Shapes warp and don't fit together,Believe the other reviews. The pieces don't fit together well and warp after very little use. The greens are a bit more brash than pictured. This cost way too much to be this poor of a product.
3,Not as great as I hoped.,"The colors aren't bright, the mat is too firm to protect the baby and it's not worth the money you spend on it. You're paying for the design, not the quality."
3,Hard to clean...,"I love having this mat down for my 5 month old to roll around on. The only problem is when it comes to cleaning it you can't just sweep it off. You have to take each piece (circle, outer ring & connectors) and clean them separately with a rag to get all the dust and hair off of them. And it does take some time to assemble the mat so it's not like you can just pick it up and put it back down when you need to."
5,We love it.,This product is beautiful. The padding is thick and comfy for play. The design looks great in our baby's room. We have not had a problem with it. The only negative thing about this product is that it is expensive. But otherwise worth owning.
4,Nice product,I like the fact that this Play Spot is suitable for younger babies as the others on the market are only for children age 3+. Love the design and the colors. The only downside for me is that these tiles are only connected in the corners so there are gaps between tiles when you walk on or sit on. [I'd placed mine on a thick carpet so it might not be a problem on hardwood.]
3,This is some seriously expensive foam!,"Generally, this product serves its purpose. We have hardwood floors, so it's nice to have. But there are too many pieces to put together. I wish the circles didn't come out. My son likes to pull them out and teeth on them; also on the connectors. A one-piece playmat would be preferable to me, or at least solid squares. Also, if you have cats like I do, they'll love to shred it, so I have to put it together and take it apart every day."
2,Too many pieces that babies can pull up,"We bought this for the kitchen to cushion a play area on our hardwood floors. I thought it was a total of 20 pieces (as the description says), but each square has at least 6 pieces. Unfortunately, my 8 month old easily figured out how to take it apart. It's cute, but wasn't at all what I thought and it was expensive to boot."
2,Should have listened to the reviews-- this is a cluttered mess!,"I went against my better judgment and ordered this item despite the clear negative reviews. Like others, I fell for the modern look and the lovely colors.Unfortunately, this is a nightmare of an item. Pieces fall out all the time. It absolutely added to the clutter of my playroom and was a safety problem for my little one, who kept tripping over the gaps created by pieces that had popped out. If you have the time and patience to assemble this thing several times a day, go for it. Otherwise, I would suggest a less attractive floormat that stays put.Also-- the smell of this item out of the bag was horrid. We let it air out for days and the odor was still very strong."
1,Poor performance,"I thought this would be a great addition to my six-month old daughter's playroom. I was looking for something that didn't scream ""baby"" and would match the decor in our home. I am completely disappointed in this product and the only thing it has going for it is the color scheme. The tiles separate VERY easy, especially when you have a curious baby who wants to pull the pieces out and chew on them. If the baby drools or spits up, it falls between the cracks of the tiles leaving a mess on the floor beneath and in between the tiles. I would not recommend this product to friends."
4,So far so good,"So far I'm glad I purchased this item for our 6-month old - granted it's a bit on the expensive side but I paid it anyway because I wanted the cute pattern and colors. I haven't had any problems with any wears or tears yet, but I am careful about what goes on or near it. I make sure we don't walk on it with our shoes or walk on it at all if we don't need to. I like the mat because it can easily be wiped clean and doesn't collect pet hair (we have a cat) like the carpet or a blanket would. I didn't have any problems assembling it or keeping the pieces together but then it's usually only myself and our daughter laying on the mat - things may change once she really starts teething and crawling and walking."
3,arrived damaged,"The rug arrived damaged in shipment so we had to send it back, but we would have had to return it anyway because of the color. It is definitely not the color of the picture as it doesn't pick up the gold's and tans at all. When I called, the customer service person said that might be because of the lighting when the photo was taken."
1,Not worth it,I bought this product about two months ago for my son. He is eight months old and takes it apart.The squares don't stay together. He tries to chew on the circles after he manages to pop those out. I am on Amazon trying to buy a foam carpet now that this product was a bust.
4,Two different styles,"The play mat actually works great for our room. I like the colors, the thickness, the smell wasn't really strong, but had a ""new"" smell for a couple days.To help save on cost we bought them used through Amazon. And they actually appeared in almost new condition... Unfortunately I wanted two packages to combine them together to make a larger play area. It appeared from the picture that would be easy to do. However, when received we got two different versions of this product. One was exactly as we planned. But the other had finished corners so we couldn't attach them and they also had bigger connectors then the other one. Plus the colors were off and didn't look right.We are returning the one that didn't match, hopefully we'll get what we intended in the end."
2,"cute, but a real pain in the you-know-what!","This mat was nice when my daughter was first learning how to crawl, but it soon became a fun puzzle for her to pull a part. Everyday. Multiple times a day. Pieces started to go missing and I got really sick of putting this ""puzzle"" back together. I was very happy to pack this thing up and store it away. Fast forward a couple years- I put it back out for my twin boys to play on outside and it quickly became one big teether. They pulled it all apart and chewed/sucked on the all the little pieces- the underside was dirty with floor grime. Yuck! I packed it all up and tried to sell it at a garage sale with no takers. The foam mats are definitly nice, but this one is a pain in the you-know-what! I recommend the big 2ft x 2ft interlocking squares. So much faster to put down and take up, plus no tempting puzzle pieces for you kids pull out and chew on. This is a cute design, but just not realistic... Unless you really like to put puzzles together."
3,Does the trick,"This is very cute, I like the bright colors, and it's a nice, comfortable padding for the floor. It's so tempting to take apart, though, that it lasted only about a week before my daughter started dismantling it regularly. And I'm just trusting Skip Hop that it really doesn't have formamide or the other cancer-causing chemicals that other mats have. They say it doesn't, but I can't help but still be a bit nervous. Still, I really like have a padded place to play in my daughter's room, since we have hardwood floors. It makes playtime a LOT more comfortable."
4,Fun & Functional,My daughter loves this mat. It is especially nice now that she is trying to crawl. I love that I can make it as big or small as needed and any mess just wipes right up.
4,Very stylish and does it's job :),"I purchased this recently for my 7 month old daughter. I loved the colors and wanted something to line the floor of her play area. We really like the mat. It is stylish and I've already gotten several compliments on it. Our daughter is already very mobile and crawls and pulls up on everything and falls sometimes. This has provided her a more cushioned area and she doesn't get as upset as she did before when she would fall on the carpet. I am very satisfied with this product and am glad I purchased it. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is king of difficult to upkeep it. (as in clean, keep the pieces from being chewed on. I would have gave it 5 stars if it was less pieces and a thicker foam."
2,I'll pass...,"We were looking for something for our basement for the kids, this isn't very durable, hard to keep clean and pieces pop out. We'll look for something else..."
5,THE BEST!!! and worth every penny,I was looking to get a play mat for my sister-in-law when I spotted this Skip Hop mat. I fell in love with it. I bought two! One for my sister-in-law and one for me (even though my child is a little older!). The kids love playing on the mat and it's so nice to look at. I actually like having it out on the living room floor. Terrific colors/design and really nice construction/materials. I'll keep buying them as long as my friends keep having babies!!!
3,"The product package was opened, not new, disappointed","When we receive this product, we found the product package was already opened,seems somebody had used it before. After we open it, we were disappointed, a lot of the pieces has stains on. I bought it as a gift for my friend, but I don't have enough time for replacement or return. So I had to clean them piece by piece,it took me hours.....Hope amazon and sellers will check product package in the future, opened box does not worth this price!!!"
2,Old version - does not work with newer playspot mats!,"I just received my second playspot mat (the first I ordered at diapers.com). While my first mat was green/brown, I ordered this one in blue/brown as the price was about $15 cheaper and because the connectors were supposed to be the same color as the green/brown ones, hence the expanded mat with two kits would have looked nice.This mat is an older playspot version, however, and does not work with the newer version that I got from diapers.com. The holes for the connectors are much smaller in this older version, so the old and new mats are not compatible. In addition, the connectors for this blue/brown mat are off white while the green/brown connectors are yellow. (Skiphop.com shows these two kits should have the same color connectors.)I am guessing the cheaper price on the blue/brown mat is reflective of these inconsistencies, but it would have been nice for amazon to note that and save me the trouble of shipping this mat back."
2,Disappointed!,"I purchased these tiles after much research on product safety, and was excited to open them and set them out for my twin grandchildren to safely crawl on. Much to my dismay, the first thing that hit me, was a strong odor. It was a mildewy, moldy smell that didn't dissipate after days of airing! I am so very disappointed and returning is such a nuisance, but the health of these babies comes first!"
4,"No smell, great for tummy time","A lot of other parents complained about the smell but we didn't think it had a strong smell at all. We ordered the brights and we are happy with the color, the mat quality and the joy it provides to the baby for tummy time. The padding on these mats is not super thick but it is enough that the baby does not flinch when her head hits it. Till now cleaning the mat and keeping the connectors in place has not been an issue for us.Shipping and Delivery was super fast by amazon.com and we also appreciated those extra connectors in the package.Overall very happy with this product.. I am thinking I'll recommend it to friends for their baby showers' list right away."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I agree with all of the negative reviews. They come apart very easily and my kids spend most of their time pulling them apart. I spend most of my day putting the pieces back together or trying to find the little parts that supposedly lock them together. I can't see how they claim that these are for babies. Some of the pieces are very small and my 11 month old loves to stick them in her mouth. I don't think we have one piece that doesn't have a set of teeth marks permanently embedded in them. For those who enjoy the aesthetic appearance of the design, I suppose this mat could be acceptable if you plan to assemble it and then never walk on it. Definitely not worth the cost."
2,Great design,"Great design very modern style, but it comes apart very easily. I know it is meant to be taken apart like a puzzle, but I am referring to the parts don't lock together very securely. When my daughter moves around on the mat the pieces look as though they are stretching apart and getting close to breaking.I loved the look of it but am sad that it isn't holding up to the demands of my little girl."
1,Don't buy. Not worth it.,"Nice colors, but this mat gets DIRTY and scratched very easily. Not very good quality, either...the pieces don't always fit nice and snug so leaves spaces between them, which collect lots of dust, baby snack crumbs and etc...(Can't believe it was designed for babies/kids!) Very very disappointed...I want to send it back to the product design dept. at Skip Hop. DON'T BUY!!"
1,Poor quality,"The mat we received had foam pieces of varying thickness and density with numerous other defects including holes, pits, fingerprints (moulded into the foam) and so on. The foam pieces do not all fit together well. Pet hair and dirt stick to it almost as if it were a lint roller. The tiles are not textured the same on both sides, so you can't flip one over if it gets damaged--the product sheet says to install them shiny side up."
2,Not Great,"I bought this for my 6-month-old twins. While I like its look and how soft it is, it was apparent right away that it wasn't going to do what I wanted it to do. It cannot properly protect the floor because the tiles separate so easily. They are also damaged very easily. So, I'm very disappointed because now I have to buy a new, bigger mat and I'm starting from scratch... will not pay another $79 to add onto this one. Buyer beware!"
1,It looks pretty but that's about it.,"I completely did not listen to the other reviews! This item is a huge pain. It comes apart walking or crawling on it. I spent the entire three weeks we had this in our home trying to put it back together, my son could take the entire mat about in about two minutes. Plus I thought my house is cleaner than those other reviewers, I vacuum and Swiffer everyday so it won't be an issue.....WRONG. It was like a dirt magnet. In three weeks it looked three years old. No matter how much you cleaned it never looked any better. Save your self the trouble and pain of returning by not buying. I did give the item one star because the colors are great and so is the idea but that's it."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","I was really excited about this product but there are definitely some flaws. 1) Gets dirty really easily (we don't even wear shoes in our house) 2) the pieces come apart by my 7mo. old 3) my baby has choked on the smaller pieces a few times 4) the pieces don't fit that well together after time and start to lift in certain areas 5) not a long term, heavy use product.I would say if your baby is just learning to crawl and you want a soft area, it's fine for a short time. But if you are looking for something that can endure wear and tear, don't bother. I've only had this for a month and I'm disturbed how bad it looks now. It was definitely a good idea in theory and very cute in design/color but for the price, it won't meet your expectations."
2,Totally scratched,"We bought this about a year ago and love the colors and design. It is really cute and we get lots of compliments. HOWEVER, it is totally scratched. Ours is smooth and I saw it in a store recently and saw they now make it rough/bumpy like a typical play mat. This may make it more durable, but I have no idea. My 8 month old has really scratched it and she doesn't even spend that much time on it. Our dogs have also done a number to it. It is also really thin. If she takes a tumble, tears are there! It comes apart easily, which makes difficult to clean the floor underneath. It doesn't look horrible, but not worth the price."
4,great product,"I love the play mats. They are a little pricier than it's counterparts and smaller in size however they match our room wonderfully. Our 9 month old crawls and rolls around everywhere on them. She absolutely loves them. In addition to the price, the other downfall would be that she pulls up the connectors and chews on them. Thank God they are bigger so she can't choke. All in all I would say it was a good purchase."
4,Great quality mat...,and more stylish than a traditional ABC mat.This mat is cushy too. I have tried another brand of mat before and this one is much softer. The only complaint I have is the connector pieces- my son is constantly taking the mat apart to teethe on the connectors.
3,Modern but needs work...,"I really loved the look of these play tiles, and bought them even though they didn't get great reviews....they look awesome- so much better than the obnoxiously bright alternative, but I do have a few problems with them. First off, since they only connect at the corners, they get a bit gappy during play. The durability leaves a lot to be desired as well, we have a superyard gate around them and some of the tiles have gotten scratched and a bit gouged very easily. They are staticky so hair and dust is definitely attracted to them, but not any more than the hardwood floor in general. I suppose it's a sacrifice for good style, but if they aren't going to be very durable, then they should be a lot less expensive."
4,Like it,"It goes well with our living room decor and the play yard color. My only complaint is that as we use it more and if we put our adult weight on it, the pieces start popping up a bit. As they do a lot more, I can see our son trying to pry them out."
3,"Very cute, not durable, pet hair sticks","I love the look of this mat but it was filled with dents and marks almost immediately. My husband can't understand why a playmat would be so delicate that you cant put anything on it. The bouncer left a dent as did an errant chair leg, a box and so on. It doesn't looks so great now. Pet hair sticks to it which is a problem because my 7 month old likes to remove the connectors and chew on them. Gross. I wipe the top side clean but the bottom seems porous and I'm not sure if you can wash them in the sink. Other than liking the stylish look I'm really not all that happy with this. The price is high for what it is."
3,"Stylish, fun for my older girl to put together but gets damaged too easily!","I love the style of this mat, but we have a few issues with it. It is overpriced, and it is not durable at all. The connectors are sort of a pain, I wish they just made the squares fit like puzzle pieces instead of using connectors. My dog walked over the mat once and made numerous puncture holes with his nails. (Granted, I should have not let him walk over the mat!) I do like that it is easy to clean and it came in a bag that we can put the mat away in every night. I did smell the mat, since I read in other reviews that it had an odor, I did not smell anything on mine. I did however, get two squares that were slightly damaged like other posters. In retrospect, I should have spent way less money and dealt with the ugly primary colored mats. When my baby is a toddler, I am sure he will be rough with it and I am not feeling like it will stand the test of time!"
4,"Excellent product, minor flaw","I purchased this playspot because it was the least garish on the market, as well as the thickest. It is also the only product I saw safety rated for kids under three. We have a ceramic tile basement where my daughter plays and the mat keeps her safe and me worry free. I have no problems with the colors; they are true to what was represented. The mat comes with a nice bag where you can store unused squares. I have no problems with dirt or dust and I have pets who have not harmed the mat at all. The squares assemble, break down, and clean easily. My only compliant (and a minor one at that) is that I don't like that the circular spots come out of the squares. It is a bit of a pain when breaking down the mat. Skip hop obviously did it that way so that you can customize the look of the mat, as it says on the packaging, which is a neat option I just wish there was a way to do that, which required less pieces! All in all and excellent product and I am glad I purchased it."
1,overpriced piece of junk,I cannot believe I paid eighty dollars for this worthless item! I really wanted to get one quickly and it was the only one I could find in BabysrUs. There are much better mats online for a fraction of cost! The interlocking mechanism does not work at all! I don't know how they came up with this idea-the pieces stop fitting together very quickly and my baby is now ignoring all his toys in favor of pulling this mat apart and putting it in his mouth which is unhygienic. Even my cats destroy the structure by getting underneath. Because of multiple small pieces you cannot move it around easily. There are many gaps in between and the squares loose thier luster after a week. I am getting a new one and will only keep a few squares for my cats to scratch-honestly thats all this mat is good for. Extremely dissappointed given high price.
5,Love it!,I've had the Playspot for around 2 weeks now and am so happy with it. It looks great in my living room (so much nicer than the ABC mat I had before)and acutally matches my decor! My daughter loved putting it together with me - I think I'm going to buy another one to put in my basement.
3,"snaps together easily, but comes apart easily as well","nice and big...thick cushioning, yet smooth...snaps together easily and looks great...The only problem is that my little boy can easily take it apart himself...since it is made of high density foam, we'll have to remove it as soon as he gets teeth because he likes to put the connector pieces in his mouth...I am constantly putting it back together, and the baby is constantly taking it apart."
4,"Overall good, but they need a better roller cover","This product worked as well as it said it would and I was happy with it. The clean up was not too bad. The one part that I was very disappointed in was the quality of the roller cover. It says that it was 3/8"" nap, but it was a very thick 3/8"" and it was just a knit cover that kept on shedding. So the whole time I was picking the lint off the wall. I haven't decided if I am going to use it for the final coat; maybe if I can figure out how to make a good roller cover work, by drilling holes in it."
2,Sorry - it's a NO for me,"I so wanted to like this product. But it was really hard for me and I wound up using a regular paint roller or even a brush. I had to apply so much pressure to get this one to work that it just wore my arms out. I LOVED the part of getting the paint in the stick - that worked well was really nice to not have a tray but applying the paint was too labor-intensive, seriously. And what others say about the clean up -OMG - forget it. Crazy to try and clean this thing. In fact I did what I could and it's sitting on my deck. So I guess I paid a bit of money to use it for a few walls. The concept - GREAT - just needs some work."
3,Sex Sex and then nothing,This is not a must buy book it's more like a friend let me hold it and it was an o.k. book the ending is terrible the plot and story was nice and the sex parts was hot. The book really does not hold your interest it get very boring.
5,Great light solo tent,"While not a place you will want to spend a lot of time, the Solitaire one-person tunnel tent is a great choice for a lightweight backpacking tent. It doesn't have enough room to sit up, but it does have enough room to read while on one's elbows, or on one's back with a book overhead. I also like the way the fly can be kept off of the head allowing one to sleep gazing at the stars above.Finally, at only about 2.5 pounds and very little space, this fits easily into an already crowded pack."
3,Eureka Solitaire Tent,"The product has some glitches. It was not very user friendly as far as setting up was concerned. Also, as a number of others complained, the pole was extremely flimsy. I reinforced it immediately with duct tape and that seemed to help somewhat. Otherwise, I am sure that the pole would have snapped, as other people had noted in their reviews. However, based on the price, it was worth the money."
2,I regret it,"Bought the tent for its lightweight feature. But that is pretty much all it has going for it. The tent has two poles....but it IS NOT user friendly to set up at all. The poles themselves are fiberglass sticks with an elastic rope in the center of it to create the arch for the tent. very very horrible. It is not a freestanding tent and it is flimsy. I regret buying this tent and sadly, I cannot return. >:("
4,Great Tent!,"I used this tent for almost a month-long hiking trip. It is a great nifty, little tent that is the perfect size for someone who doesn't mind not having tons of room. When it rained, the rain cover that comes with the tent worked perfectly. I never got wet when I was inside that tent once! My only complaint is that it is a bit awkward to get in and out of the tent. It has two entrances, both of which take careful maneuvering, but it really wasn't a huge deal to me. My last complaint is that because the entrance on the top is awkward to get in and out of, after a month of use, the netting has been stretched out and when I lay in the tent, the top netting hangs a bit low. But this is a great hiking tent and I still use it!"
4,Great Scouting/Back packing tent,"Bought this tent for my son who is in Scouts and had a week long backpacking trip. He raved about how great the tent was on his trip. He stayed dry in heavy rain and no problems. Very lightweight and easy to pack. Only complaint, you have to get on your knees to get into the tent."
3,Know why you are buying this,"Pros: Light weight, weather proof, works as advertised, low profile can withstand high winds, can be converted into a ventilated space in warm weather.Cons:Not a free standing tent so a bit fiddly to assemble particularly in the dark and in high winds. A bit cramped with no room for a back pack or boots. Difficult to get in and out of with the mat and sleeping bag. I am still working on a proper technique to accomplish this."
4,Light but flimsy poles,"This is a perfect tent as long as you know what it's intended for...backpacking. It is super light and has plenty of room for me (6'2, 240lbs). If you think it is going to be a Hilton in a bag, don't get it. If you are looking to minimize weight and size for a tough climb, then this is what you want.The problem is with the poles. They use thin, cheap fiberglass poles that broke the first time I used it. Get some aluminum poles to replace the crappy ones, and it works well."
2,Not Freestanding -- Needs to be Staked and Tied to Work,"I do a lot of camping with the Scouts. I bought this tent for my Boy Scout son and was very disappointed when I learned that it is NOT freestanding. It needs to be staked and tied down on both ends in order to work properly. This is not practical if the terrain is not conducive to securing with stakes and tie lines: hard soil, rocks, soft/muddy soil, snow, and ice all make staking a tent down very difficult. My experience with tents in the past is also that a FULL rain fly is very important in order to stay warm and dry, regardless of season. I have never really understood why one would need a different tent for different seasons. In warm weather you just leave the rain fly off the tent and open the vents -- That's your summer tent. In the cold weather a full, snug rain fly is your best bet."
1,Not Freestanding - Set Up Too Long AVOID,"The box DOES not say it requires all corners to be staked out. Not until you read the manual. Had to return. It looks free standing in the ad and on the box. So if you are in Sand, Snow, hard or wet ground You can not really set up. Also, It would take too long to setup if weather changed. This is NOT for serious fast packers or experienced backpackers (31 years now). Based upon prior use of Eureka products I expected better, they blew it. Other reviewers said the poles broke too easily. Equipment should be designed and tested by real world users, not cube slaves. ALWAYS test gear before you venture out."
2,Very Fragile - Beware,"Tent is small and compact. However, on my first use, the large pole broke. It is made for a very, very tight fit. The manufacturer no longer manufactures this tent, so replacement poles must be purchased by a 3rd party. Cost for this one pole with shipping is $20 vs. original tent cost of $63. Buyer beware!"
4,great tent,this tent is great it is a little small but i expected that. There is plenty of room for me and my pack when i camp.cons:door is so u have to take your shoes off to get in if you put your head to the door.Pros:nice tentlots of leg room
3,Eureka Solo Solitaire Tent,The tent is fine. Lightweight and compact. Great for a minimalist overnight backpacker. The stakes however bend easily and are junk. Find yourself strong lightweight stakes and you'll be satisfied.
3,Nice tent poor pole configuration,"I love the portability of this tent. I've taken it out 5 times the last season.When putting this thing together the back pole is fine however, the front pole that arc's around the door is always very hard to put in the sleeve provided. I always feel like I'm about to rip through the fabric as it bends to make the half circle shape for the door. When taking it apart the pole always gets stuck midway through and it takes me to a frustration level that I could do without. I will continue to use this tent due to the weight/price pointe.When the fabric breaks due to stress I will be writing a seperate review :)I do recommend this for others looking for lightweight comfortable bivy's. I just don't think it will be handling multiple years of use."
4,Affordable and fairly compact for backpacking,It is a simple and affordable one-person backpacking tent. My 13-year-old son was able to set it up easily. The only thing I don't like are those stakes. I will buy some solid ones from Harbor Freight before next trip.
4,Definite purchase for the price/weight,"Agree with other reviewers that have said this tent is a great value and very compact/lightweight. Have only used it once so far; backpacked into the Gila Wilderness in southern New Mexico. It POURED from 8:30pm til about 5am- I was very skeptical about the ability to repel heavy downpours due to many reviews I had read prior to purchase, but it held up perfectly (and when I say it poured, I mean intense ponding throughout our campsite). Floor, ceiling, and walls stayed dry throughout the rainfall.Overall, no complaints, but obviously one trip is not necessarily indicative of overall performance. I will be back up the Gila in two weeks, and confidently expect similar conditions and results.... If you're looking for something cheap, light, and effective, I would certainly recommend this tent; just be prepared to leave your pack outside in the elements- buy a good rainfly for your pack."
4,"Great Value, Lightweight","I love my solitaire. It's incredibly lightweight and inexpensive. I use this tent for multiple day bicycle trips and solo backpacking or kayaking trips. I've never had a problem with rain/snow (I've had it snow as much as 3 inches while sleeping in mine).There are at least two models, and I think the newer one has aluminum poles and a zipper down the middle for getting out. I'd go with the aluminum poles if you can find them. One of my poles is held together with electrical tape (only reason I'm not giving 5 stars). The other downside is the 12 or so stakes required to hold it up."
2,my mistake,Ok I just spent over a week with this tent in the boundry waters and here is what I experienced. The first time setting it up was a bit confusing at first but after learning how it went up it was not bad to set and put away and stuffed back in its bag with out to much if a fight. We did have lots of rain and with out sealing it did stay dry. The down side was the size it was so small and u can't sit up in it was a big down fall !!! And the other was its not free standing!!! You had to pick a spot with good ground not the cool view you want. And two days in a poll snapped ?!?! So now this tent will be a play tent for the kids. I I will spend more on a tent and that I can sit up in and is free standing.
4,Great bargain for price (Purchased when it was around $60),"This is my main backpacking tent. I went with a large group and set up and took down much quicker than some of the fancier ones. Yes it's small, but what do you do other than sleep? Very light and easy to pack. In cold weather, it traps in your body heat like an oven. Would recommend for any beginner-intermediate backpackers looking to save some money on a one man tent."
3,"Nice tent, very cheesy poles!","Great small tent, but Eureka should be ashamed of selling those fiberglass poles -guarantee you'll break them within a year of use and Eureka won't stand behind them!"
3,Great for the price....,"This tent does have a lot of condensation buildup inside, even with the door open. The tent is constructed well. I am 6ft tall and 200lbs and I can roll over easily without touching the top. I would not recommend this for anyone over 6ft though. The tapered ends are steep and your head and feet will touch and cause you to get wet (condensation). The fly is rather complex and is a pain to deal with in the dark, and is impossible to close from inside the tent. For the price and the weight, a lot of these drawbacks can be overlooked. If I had it to do over again, I would buy the Eureka two man tent with double vestibule for not much more weight/cost."
2,Eureka Solitair tent,"This should be a great tent ... BUT ... the poles suck. Both poles broke the 1st time I used the tent. The ""head"" pole is about 2"" too long right from the factory. I had to cut the 2"" off the pole in order for it to be of any use at all. Both poles are fiberglass shock cord, so very light. However, they are too narrow in diameter, so they break very easily. I had to duct-tape the poles to make it thru the weekend. The tent itself, when erected is the perfect solo tent in my opinion. Much more comfortable and spacious than a bivy sick, and nearly as light. Redesign of the poles and this tent would be awesome for the $ ... the 2 star rating is for poor pole quality ... the concept, tent size and weight of the tent is great ... perhaps 4-5 stars. Hopefully, Eureka can address this issue and they would have a winner."
1,i will NEVER recommend this tent,"i setup this tent for the first time last night.. everything set up fine, but the fiberglass poles snapped in the middle of the night. They are not strong enough to support the tension from the tent. Every joint in the pole is either snapped completely through or is cracked. After reading more reviews online, it appears this is a very popular complaint with eureka tents, and they are doing nothing to fix the problem. Considering the price, i guess it is an ok tent, but its more than worth it to shove out an extra $100 bucks for a descent tent from another brandname."
4,"Lite, Compact and Durable","This tent is everything it advertises. I've taken it on many trips and never had a problem. Since it is not self standing, I keep fearing that I'll end up in a place where I can't get the stakes in or the ground is too soft. Hasn't happened yet, but I think it is only a matter of time. I'm not tall or wide, so I fit in it fine with my shoes and some supplies, but I can see how it could be tight for other people. The zipper system isn't completely intuitive to me, but I'm able to get in and out without troubles and I've never gotten cold in it, even in below freezing temperatures."
5,it's so simple....,"After having issues with a previous tent purchase, I went ahead and purchased this tent. It arrived well ahead of schedule (Saturday) and today (Sunday 11-4-12) I decided to see how fast I could set this tent up. I carried everything out to the back yard, laid out the ground cover and, with the directions held down by a stone from the garden, commenced making camp!15 minutes later (slow this time as I went back to the instructions constantly) the tent was up and ready for use. I figure that I can set the tent up, completely staked in under 7 minutes, now that I know what to do.The instructions are well written and very clear. As a one-person 3-season tent I don't think you'll get a better deal!!!I cannot wait for the next deer season to take this out and be comfortable and dry.For those who want a single person tent that is, in my opinion, easy to set up and use, you cannot go wrong with this tent"
3,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles case of the killer pizzas,The tracking on it was better than the one I already have but it too had some bad spots in it.
4,Delightfully Awful,"Classic MST3K! The plot: A young California girl drives through the mountains and spies a caveman. Then her friends laugh at her. She does manage to convince her father and her boyfriend, and before you know it, she and dad are in the caveman's cave. Oh, my it's creepy, especially with pops trying to calm the girl as Eegah tries to seduce her with his paleolithic wiles. Eegah? More like Eeeurgh! Back to town for the last stand at the pool party, and that's it in a nutshell.All that, and you get Joel and the bots in the front row, commentating. Sure it's probably not the best episode, but it's definitely good for a few laughs. If you like the rest of MST3K, you'll like this episode just fine, too."
2,Ehhh...,"To start things off, I just want to say that Joel is NOT my favorite human on MST3K. That being said, I this episode was mediocre. The movie was a plotless and ridiculous big foot type movie with so many chances for amusing comments, you couldn't count them. Unfortunately, the comments that the boys made weren't all that funny. Some times they were funny, but this is perhaps the worst movie I ever saw and they didn't come up with half as much amusing things as I'd expect. I don't recommend this dvd."
4,Eegah is eegreat!,"Even though I've only had the chance to see a few of the MST3K movies - I can tell from Eegah that I'm in for years of giggles, laughs and catch phrases. This movie has already filled my household with the echos of ""Cabbage Patch Elvis"" and ""Watch out for snakes! ""This film makes it hard not to watch the others I bought right away.....I have to pace myself...with Pod People and Shorts 2 still unwrapped and waiting I'm going to have to show some will power!Eegah is well worth it! Make sure the pause and rewind buttons work on your VCR....you'll be using them lots!"
5,Great Episode.,"This was the first episode of MST3K I ever saw. I was blown away, and have been a fan ever since; even though my cable company never got Comedy Central (until MST3K left of course). A hysterical episode; watch out for snakes!"
2,Unrealistic,"First off, ever since I turned eight (now I am nine), I started to hate these books!Secondly, in one of the books (maybe tenth one?) Abby turns eleven. When it reaches the higher books, all of a sudden she's ten again.Lastly, A FIFTH GRADER HAVING A BOY FRIEND? WEARING BELLY BUTTON SHIRTS? My dad would hate this book. I'm not allwoed to date till twenty years old and not allwoed to wear belly button shirts. I HATED THIS BOOK!"
4,"NGK Spark Plug Wire Set - very good, not perfect","The quality of the NGK spark plug wire set is excellent, equal or better than the Honda OEM wires. However, one of the wires was slightly longer, about 1/2"", than the original wire. The longer wire had to start at the wrong angle, but it fit. So, the fit was very good, but not perfect."
3,"Great facts, little elaboration","192 pages hardly allows the author room to expound on Hepburn's real life. I felt that I got a good overview of her, but would like to more about her-- especially what it was like to work with her on various movies. This is a good introductory biography, but I want more."
2,Does not fool ants,"I specifically bought hits food dish due to some ant problems I've had. It flat did not work. It kept the ants out for a day or two, a couple of days ago, I looked to see my pet's food completely covered with ants.Do not buy for ants."
5,Does the trick!,"This bowl really works. I was a little skeptical about it, but really wanted a bug-proof (specifically ant proof) bowl that didn't utilize a moat. I'd been using my own makeshift ""moat"" by placing our dog food bowls in an upside-down rubbermaid lid filled with water and a little dishsoap. It worked, but it would get nasty in no time due to our dogs dropping dry food bits in the water. Yuck!Even though this is pricey, it was well worth the money."
3,Jurassic Sparks?,"Robert J. Sawyer sure has a thing for cancer, Canada and craters. All three figure prominently in both his Calculating God, the first of his books that I read and this one, the second, as do dinosaurs, mass extinction, paleontology and the Royal Museum of Natural History. I have seen him compared to some of the greats of hard science fiction but that is I think a big miscasting. There is precious little hard science in his fiction, but there are interesting premises. This one mixes up time travel, first contact, alternate histories and various theories about the cause of the Tertiary-Cretaceous mass extinction to a pleasant if not overly deep result. Like Calculating God, It was fun, it was short, it was not overly ambitious, and it was short on the kind of science that I usually like in my hard SF. But like the last book, I still liked it OK, and I will try one or two more looking for that big story that I have a feeling might be inside him somewhere."
1,Martians? Why did I buy this???,"I was looking for a time-travel book & I love dino movies, but this book, my first read by Sawyer, was worse than disappointing. It was like reading an old '50's short story when flying saucers, Martian slime, and the idea that dino's are cold-blooded was popular. Well, those days are over.For $15, save your money for something that can draw you into a story that is halfway believable.Btw, it's more about the relationship between 2 guy-buddies than dinos, and that relationship wasn't much to speak of either.A totally unbelievable story that I forced myself to finish since I paid so much for the over-sized thing."
3,A decent light read,"Intersting premise, but not a serious sci-fi novel. Maybe I'm spoiled by the likes of ""A Fire Upon the Deep,"" ""A Deepness in the Sky,"" The Heechee books, the Ringworld books, etc. Nothing I have seem from Sawyer comes close to that type of scope, imagination, or style. If you're casting about for something to read because you've exhausted Frederick Poul, Larry Niven, Vernor Vinge, etc. then this might have to do. If you haven't exhausted those, do yourself a favor and do that first."
3,Very Odd,"I was expecting more of a ""Jurassic Park"" novel, so thid was a bit of a surprise. It's an OK read, but the characters are one-dimensional. Iliked his Hominids books, but this was sort of strange."
2,Great Book For Kiddies,"Robert Sawyer's books have featured an assortment of funny and entertaining cartoon characters-- alien scientists , talking dinosaurs and in this case destructive microbes. His book is really for children rather than intelligent adults."
4,"Theme similar to ""Calculating God""","""End of an Era"" is a fast, pleasant read. A bit fuzzy on some logical points, which are quickly glossed over as quantum mechanical weirdness. The story posits the strangest scenario for the K-T mass extinction (short of Gary Larson's ""Far Side"" suggestion that the dinosaurs died from cigarette smoking). The theme is similar to Sawyer's ""Calculating God"", a better novel, in my opinion."
3,It was okay.,"This was an enjoyable read, but not one of Sawyer's better stories. If you are a Sawyer fan already, check it out. If you haven't read much Sawyer yet, I'd reccomend trying a different title."
4,A loopy solution to what caused dinosaur's end,"This novel is obviously a joke by Robert J. Sawyer, a palaeontology scholar who know very well his dinos. Were the dinosaurs wiped out by a big bad Asteroid or by a giant volcanic eruption? Two scientists go with a time machine to investigate. The scenario they found is purposedly crazy and unlikely in the extreme: here the model of Sawier is the pulp sci-fi of the thirties, when the words ""scientific plausibility"" were still unknown, interpreted with today state of the art knowledge The result is a masterpiece of zany imagination, and not to be taken as a serious hypothesis, of course. I loved it!"
2,End of an Era Indeed,"This is the first of Sawyer's books that I did not enjoy. I thought the combination of dinosaurs and time-travel would be a winning combination. That's what I get for thinking. The plot was boring and a bit far-fetched for my tastes. There's a certain level of believability that I like and this one didn't fall within the parameters. The characters were dull or irritating. The dino encounters were lackluster. The plot was, to me, a bit silly. The sub-plots, even sillier. I would be more specific but it would require me to give away plot points in the book. I may be critical but I don't wish to ruin anyone elses read. They may find the book delightful. I did not."
5,GREAT QUICK READ,"I really loved this book, it is a quick read with a unique time travel story and an unusual take on the Dinosaurs. I loved it and you will too."
5,THE most colorful geology book ever,If you want a basic book that will help you understand geology you need this book. the book can fit anyone from age 7 to 70 (while you still see). every kid can understand basic geology concepts by looking at the pictures and reading the wothy text. even if you are a geologist like me you still enjoy wonderful pictures and great explanations. the glossary and the index help you find and understand hard words and terms
2,Ok i guess,"This book was advertised as the 10th edition, but was really the 9th edition. The seller contacted me and offered my money back or a discount, but I didn't respond promply to the email, so I ended up with the book anyway. I ended up buying it from the bookstore too. This books seemed to be the same, exempt the chapters were in different orders. I felt that is was my fault for not responding to the email, but advertising the right edition I think is key if you are going to sell books online."
5,One of the very best pop vocalists of the 1950s!,"As a mid-period Boomer long interested in the pop music that was charting prior to my arrival, I was amazed and delighted to discover through this excellent CD that Jaye P. Morgan was one of the very best popular singers of the 1950s! Having only heard a couple of her RCA novelty sides, I was not prepared for the elegant, beautifully-assured, and classy ballad performances contained herein, of which ""The Longest Walk"" might be the best. In fact, this side may be the quintessential 1950s pop ballad. No serious fan of 1950s popular vocalizing can be without this CD. The technical aspects are near-perfect, and the price is right. Grab it, quickly and greedily!"
5,Where is Sunday Kind Of Love,"I started looking for Jaye P. Morgan when the song, ""A Sunday Kind Of Love"", suddenly came to mind as I was driving the other day. It has always been my favorite Jaye P. Morgan song from when I first heard her sing it back in the 50's and I can't understand why it isn't on any of the listings here. If anyody knows where I can find a CD or casette with Sunday Kind Of Love on it, please let me know.Carnes32 @AOL.com."
