3,Guilty pleasure reading,"This book seemed a little silly when I started reading it. It's a fictional account of the relationship between a young waitress in Arles and Vincent Van Gogh. Still, many of the historical facts are accurate, and it was interesting to imagine Provence in a different era. I read this book right before a trip to Provence, and it definitely made the trip to Arles more interesting. It was somewhat hard to forget that the plotline of the novel was hokey, but I really did get into it by the end. I wouldn't pay full price for this book, but I would willingly read it if I found a copy at the library."
5,Exactly What I was looking 4,"This micro phone was exactly what I was looking for. It was described correctly, shipped quickly and I had no problems with any part of this order."
4,Transcends Cultures!,"You don't have to be an Arab American to appreciate this collection of short stories. Some of the voices may not be familiar, but many of the stories are. At times heartbreaking, at times hilarious, each story represents a facet of the human experience. If you consider yourself to be a literary adventurer, add this anthology to your ""to do"" list."
1,Watch Out...Not what you expect.,"Beware buying ""Bernardaud"" on Amazon. These bowls appear to me to be high quality fakes. They are thicker than my set and the embossed logo on real Bernardaud on the bottom is a decal on the one from Amazon. I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think so. If these are not counterfeit, they must be seconds. Bowls were very poorly packed, not like factory shipped, and one arrived broken. As for me, I going to pay a little more for the real thing elsewhere."
2,Clothes Rack,"Although I paid a lot of money for shipping, this clothing rack is below average. I thought it would be sturdier than it actually is. When extended to its full height, it tipped over several times. One strong wind and it will collapse. I was disappointed with this purchase."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this rack a few weeks ago upon moving into an apartment with little closet space. It wasn't too difficult to put together, but the bars that go on top as a shelf constantly were falling out. At one point, the entired clothing rack tipped over and I had to put it back up and put my clothes back on it. Then the plastic pieces on the base and on the top of the rack snapped. This product is priced very low for a reason."
1,terrible product,"i bought this rack to store my off-season clothes. this does not include heavy coats.assembly was easy. however, when clothes were placed on the rack the supporting poles ""sunk"", which resulted in my clothes grazing the ground. use this product only if you have 5-10 items to hang. otherwise, your stuff will end up sweeping the floor!"
2,Not very sturdy.,"It only took about 10 minutes to assemble this rack, and I was taking my sweet time. I made sure that all of the connections were tight. I then hung several women's coats and a few pairs of pants on it. The clothing weighed no more than maybe 15 pounds. While pushing the rack to a different part of the room, one of the wheels hit the edge of a throw rug. The upper part of the rack began to twist under the weight of the clothes. Then the entire rack began to tip over. I had to hold the rack upright while I straightened the vertical poles.Conclusion: This rack would work OK if you kept it in one spot. But, if you plan on moving your rack frequently or even occasionally, spend a little more and get one of the professional models. This rack is not sturdy enough for moving things around."
4,Splendid!,"Made in EU in 2000, Serial# 949-086-0, Playing Time 154:57This 2-disc compilation covers CDB's career from 1980's ""Eastern Wind"" up to 1999's ""Quiet Revolution"".There's already quite a few ""greatest hits"" packages released, but this one includes 2 previously unreleased tracks (""Patricia The Stripper 2000"", a re-make of the song from the ""Spanish Train..."" album, plus ""There's A New Star Up In Heaven Tonight"".)It also includes tracks that were ""added"" on earlier compilations, like ""The Traveller"", ""The Waiting Heart"" and ""A Spaceman Came Travelling(1995 version)"".If your collection of CDB is not extensive, this album is a great choice; if you're unfamiliar with this rock ""troubadour"", or only know a few tracks, this item is a must: 2-and-a-half hours of listening enjoyment!"
4,easy read for genetics text,"so, this book was purchased for my sophomore level genetics class and it was a pretty interesting read. It wasn't boring and really drawn out like most science texts."
1,"This vacuum sucks--actually, it doesn't","I've gone through several of this model. Where does one begin? This vaccum initially works well, but loses suction as soon as dirt accumulates in the canister. The attachments are a joke. No matter how securely you attach them, they fall off soon after you begin to use them. That cute little attachement with the brush bar? All for looks. The brush bar quites turning the minute it gets dirty. You can plan to have the brush bar motor replaced after a couple of months. As someone noted previously, the belts stretch and the motor burns up. And heaven help you if you try to work with Hoover's appallingly bad ""customer service."" Hoover has put its money into making their product look appealing, but function very poorly indeed. I will never buy another Hoover. If your looking for a DISPOSABLE vacuum cleaner, then this is the model for you!"
1,DO NOT BUY ANY SELF PROPELLED HOOVER VACUUMS,"HOOVER HAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE BELTS STRETCHING OUT ON ALL THE SELF PROPELLED VACUUMS, BUT WILL DO NOTHING FOR CUSTOMERS STUCK WITH THEM! WE MUST REPLACE THE DRIVE AND PROPEL BELTS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS. REDICULOUS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE"
1,"Do NOT buy this vacuum, or any vacuum from Hoover","I have never written an online review, but I am compelled to write one now. I purchased this vacuum 4 months ago. Since then, it has broken 3 times with only light use (about twice a month), and I have had to drive it 30 minutes to the nearest Hoover service center, then go back a few days later to pick it up. The third time it broke I called Hoover to find out how I could go about replacing or exchanging it. They told me ""that's what the warranty is for,"" and said they would not take responsibility for replacing it. So I am stuck with it. Based on this experience, I would caution anyone to think twice about purchasing a Hoover. I certainly will never buy from them again."
2,Mixed feelings,"Over the past fives years I've owned two Hoover self-propelled uprights and may buy another. That says something about this cleaner's reliability. I wonder if these units are designed to fail after a year.But when they work, they're great, provided one doesn't mind (1) the filthy job of having to empty the container and clean the filter after each use and (2) having to change the belts every two to three months. Purchasing the bagged model, if you can find, it will solve the first issue.The problem is that I can't find a better choice in the market for a self-propelled unit. Make a note of that engineers and inventors!"
1,Would not reccomend this vacuum!!!,"Like one of the previous reviewers, I have never written a review before. I absolutely HATE this vacuum. It clogs all too often and does not have the suction my old hoover had. When dumping the canister out, the dust you have collected spills everywhere. So much for those who have allergies. Then I spent some time cleaning out the canister (I like the bag method better). My old hoover was 14 years old an sucked a lot better than this one!!! We donated the old one. Should have donated this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Maynard and Sly, Together Again...?","As with all of Maynard Ferguson's late-Seventies/early Eighties output, it's important to recognize the context in which ""Hot"" was recorded. Most importantly, remember that this is an album released in the wake of MF's ""Rocky"" hit-making heyday - so it includes rather agonizing tunes like ""Rocky II Disco"", featuring Stallone on grunts and punching bag (!). But this album, on CD for the first time, is a must-own if for nothing else but the gorgeous version of John Coltrane's ""Naima"" - the arrangement soars, and Maynard's playing is beautiful on both flugelhorn and trumpet. Just be sure to hit the stop button at the end of the tune, though, or you'll be subjected to ""Topa Topa Woman""..."
3,Not Maynard's Finest Hour,"Even as a Maynard fan, I find this one hard to enjoy. There are a couple good tracks: Gabriel, which is clearly a follow-up to Maynard's successful ""Gospel John"" on the Chameleon album; and Naima, which is a very good ballad. But Rocky II (also an attempt to build on an earlier success) and Star Trek in disco are painful experiences. As always, the band and Maynard are in fine form, even if the tunes aren't that interesting.So, if you're a Maynard fan, this one can easily join your collection, but if you're taking a first look at Maynard, start somewhere else!"
5,Great Book,This is the single best book I have ever seen on the art of proofs. You really don't even need a teacher to guide you with this book. It is expensive but then so are all textbooks now.
4,Superb,"This book is an excellent introduction to the basic of mathematical logic and proofs, the latter laying the foundation for advances areas of mathematics such topology, algebra, analysis, among others.Highly recommened in conjunction with Vellemen's wonderful text.Dock 1 star for comparatively hefty price (in this regard, see Velleman and Eccles comparative cheapness!)."
3,Good book for what it is,"I am currently using this book for a class right now. I find this book easy to read and work with, but wish there was more examples explaining each kind of proof. Although there are quite a few examples to the proofs, I just need a few more to work with. I am going to purchase another proof writing book to supplement this one, as this is my first dealings with proofs. All in all though, this is a good book."
1,ultimate dancing championships,"The 3 headline fights were 13 rounds of suck. Nothing to see here, fast forward city. You could spend your time doing something much better, like feeding pigeons in the park or using the money saved and getting a nice big all you can eat buffet and then taking a nap.1 star is rather generous."
3,Brighton Rock (1947),"This is a well-made crime drama, not the top rank (like Double Indemnity or The Third Man), but quite good and rather subtle. It has the merit of considerable fidelity to the book and was scrpted by the author Graham Greene.Kino Classics Presents: They Made Me a Fugitive (aka I Became a Criminal) [Blu-ray]They Made Me a FugitiveDouble Indemnity [DVD + Digital Copy] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)A Double Life [Blu-ray]"
4,Great read!!!,"A lovely, funny read. The royals are handled with respect (well, except the bubble-headed Di) and affection. I would have given it five stars but for the ending, the writing of which was obviously farmed out to the local elementary school."
4,excellent story,"This was an excellent story, I really enjoyed it. As ordinary people I almost started to like some of the royals, like Prince Charles for example who really turned out to be a rebel with a pigtail. The best character in my opinion was Harris, the queen's dog, who finally found his freedom. It is a shame this is a fictional story for I would love to be one of their neighbours in real life. I recommend this story to anyone who is against monarchies, for it really gives you a good laugh and the hope that you would some day really have the pleasure to see this happen."
4,Highly amusing!,"The royal family finds itself living among the poor, having to adapt to the equivalent of our Social Security. Sue Townsend does a marvelous job capturing each of the royals' personalities and how they might (humorously) react to existing in such a manner. Even the chapter titles are funny. I found myself avoiding reading the titles until I had finished the chapters, then I would go back for a chuckle. One of the funniest characters is the Royal Dog, Harris. His attempt to run with the local pack is priceless! Of course I winced when someone asks Diana what she will miss the most of her former lush life and she answers, ""My Mercedes."" But take into account that this was written well before Diana's tragedy, and the rest of the book is indeed worth reading."
5,This is an absolutely delightful book.,"The novel concerns the Royal family, which must now life like ordinary citizens because of a change in government. From now on, they will live in council housing--two bedrooms, one bath--with no staff or servants of any kind. Now each will be addressed by their given names rather than by title. The Queen, Mrs. Windsor, at first is quite incapable of performing the simplest tasks. ""[She] tried to open the door. It was extraordinarily difficult. True, it was years since she'd opened the front door of any house, but surely it had been easier than this?"" Charles is the only one who is delighted since he will never have to be King. The novel is filled with misunderstandings and complications based on ignorance of even the most fundamental needs. ""There's no lavatory paper, Lilibet,"" whispered the Queen Mother. ""How does one obtain lavatory paper?"" . . . ""One has to buy it from a shop,""said Charles. There is no meanness in this satire, only lots of fun."
4,I have never seen the Royal Family of England in this way,"I loved reading the queen and I, it gives you a totally different look of the stiff Royal Family of England. The book criticeses the Members of the Royal family completely, sometimes they even look ridiculous. I never knew that Charles did not want to be king and I never knew that Prince Philip was such a spoiled person. The book gives you a look at the way the population ( at least one)sees the United Kingdom. i mean the social benefits, prison life etc."
3,Not really fantastic,"When I started reading the book I did not really like it. I do not know a thing about the Royal family of England and it is not really something I am interested in either. But I must admit that there are quite a few funny parts in the story. Sue Townsend criticises a lot of social aspects of Britain in the book which could make you think about certain matters in a different way. It is not a book I would choose to read myself even though a lot of people love it, but it is a nice book."
5,Excellent!!!,"Had this in a 33 1/3 years ago. Never thought it would become avaialble on CD. Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the sound of rain, distant thunder, train sounds mixed in with beautiful music. Not only romantic but my therapy at the end of a long day of noise and clutter."
4,One Stormy Night- Great Plains Nostalgia,"""One stormy Night"" captures the essence of the nostalgic side of life on the Great Plains in the 40's and 50's. The audio backdrop is a slow moving thunderstorm enhanced by the lazy, soft music of the Mystic Moods Orchestrapunctuated by occasional loud claps of thunder and enhanced by the distant barking of a hound and the lonesome wail of a steam locomotive's whistle.The theme is versatile- solitary relaxation, romantic background music, orthe last sounds before dropping off for a nights sleep. It's an essential element of anyone's collection."
5,I first got this LP in the early 60's,I love Local Freight best of all. I miss the old steam trains of my youth and can remember lying awake in the wee hours and hear the lonesome whistles as they passed through our small town.
3,One Stormy Night Recording,"I wrote a review for this already but received an email stating I needed to review this item I ordered. So I am doing this a second time. I searched on amazon.com for a CD of One Stormy Night. I did not know that doing a search for a CD would ALSO bring up 33 1/3 rpm records. When I received the package I was surprised to find a record, not a CD as I thought I had ordered. The record cover was fine, the record condition was without any scratches. Now I will have to find a way to transfer the record I purchased to a CD. The order was received promptly and in good condition."
4,One Stormy Night revisited,"This CD is actually a reissue of an LP released in 1965. It was nearly 3 years in the making and many of the selections are original. The basis for this album is the recording of a freak summer thunderstorm over L. A. that raged from midnight to 4 A.M. in 1961. The number 1 track ""A DREAM"", was a very big hit on the easy listening radio stations around the country. Although we have had this LP since the late 1960s, I am considering purchasing the CD as well."
5,i knew this was a special album,"oh. my. god.i got a copy of this at the goodwil for $.99 on cassette. it was put out in 1972 by mobile fidelity prods., distributed by bainbridge ent. co. inc. i knew this was special. whoah. the slow crazy lazy sound brought me back to a time, now i know it was 1965!! incredible.kind of weird, has a certain something... wow... especially because i love rain and the sound of rain. when i was a kid i used to record thunderstorms and all my songs would have rain mixed in because it just sounded so cool.what a treat! hi everyone!"
3,In my opinion,This movie is not the worst and it's not the best. It's okay. It could have been better. The plot was good but the Madusa's were not really all that great which made the movie appear of less quality. But it keeps up your interest enough to watch it.
1,Voice Lessons,"I can not get over how awful this move is. Merlin in this movie should have taken voice lessons! Seriously, I could not watch the entire movie because the delivery of lines were painful."
2,'Twould be useful (for reviewing purposes) if I could comprehend more than a third,"of Merlin's throaty, mumbled lines.Although I am admittedly a ""sucker"" for the medieval/renaissance/dragon-and-sword-fighting genre, I found this film unworthy of any attempts to seek the script as a remedy. (Had a friend or family member been involved in its production, I would have pursued such an avenue.)I *will* say the film has relatively decent cinematography for its production quality. Visuals are its salvation, I opine."
2,knights of the Round Table,"Knights of the Round Table do battle with Medusa. It was a decent sword and sorcery flick, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,am i seriously reviewing a candle?,"ok, it came on time and in the condition specified, thats it. Thats all you need to know about freakin candle. oh and it smells good?"
2,Just OK,I bought two of these candles because of the reviews. I was expecting too much. I bought the deep clover one and the clean crisp white. While they smelled nice the smell wasnt as strong as I expected. I live in a tiny condo and the only time I could smell anything from these candles was when I walked past them. I've had much better luck with a cheaper candle from department stores. Even yankee candles have a stronger scent. On the plus side the candles look nice and they were packaged very well.
2,Unimpressed,"I was v. unimpressed with some of the fragrances, especially Squid Surprise and Old Man's Cadaver.Who the heck wants their house smelling like some elderly fisherman died there last week?Also, an electric bulb works better at lighting a room and is way cheaper to run."
5,awesome,Votivo candles are just the best. The Red Currant is my sisters favorite and this was a very good price!! Her whole house has the suttle smell of this candle!!
3,shipping cost too high,The product is fine has good smellThe shipping was too high it was almost the same price I paid for itthen they put a high price for the duty papers so I got dinged by the duty folks too will not buy from them again
2,Another GH!!! this is the third one.,"I don't recommend this CD+dvd is better if you purchase the dvd separetaly has 2 disc, more videos, interviews, foto gallery, eastern eggs & much more; the cd is the same (no change). It is just another excuse to make more money from Capitol Records & Emi Records. Don't waste your MONEY!!! be smart."
5,Good Stuff,"Isolee's second album, Western Store, is a huge leap from the first, We are Monster. Isolee, which is the product of a German producer, mixes trance funk ambient jams to a steady beat. Comparable a little to Chemical Brothers without the in your face attitude. If you want something to chill out to and enjoy as background music, buy this album. If you want something to bounce during a party, Buy this album. It is fantastic."
4,Pure Hitchcock Fun,"Sure, this film is a little light when compared to Hitchcock's masterpieces, but when judged against his lesser works it really stands out. And it's pure fun all the way through. So, what more do you want? Maybe not everyone will be able to get into this movie. For example, if you need everything fed to you - literally shoved down your worthless waiting throat with your brain on hold - and expect constant hyped up unrealistic action or else your brain falls asleep, then you probably won't like it much. Simply put, if you don't like this movie you should be shot in the face."
1,BORING,"I rarely fall asleep during a movie unless it's past my bedtime. For a Hitchcock, this is a disappointment. After the first hour I was still waiting for something to happen; when it ended, I was still confused. I'm very surprised that it got so many 5-stars. Oh well...to each his own."
2,macabre comedy with cheerfully unfeeling people,"This is a really odd film: there is a body that gets a bunch of accomplices deeply involved with each other. While trying to hide something and caring nothing whatsoever for Harry the corpse or even displaying any normal emotions, they go about their merry ways and get in deeper and deeper until they seem to have manipulated events to their likings. Unfortunately, it really didn't work for me at a basic level - I couldn't believe in them, didn't think it was funny, and could barely pay attention. However, it is fun to see the introduction of Shirley MacLean, who is a truly fine actress.Not recommended. I just didn't get it."
1,Waste of money,I was so excited to buy this film. It does not work in my region and cannot get my money back from the seller. Total waste of money. Buyer beware!!!
1,Awful Seller,"In very small print I find out that this DVD won't work on most US DVD players, so the DVD is useless, thanks a lot!"
2,Skip it.,"I like Hitchcock and I like dark humor. I think you can get away with the absurd if it's believable within the world you created. Just my opinion, but this is a dumb movie with a weak, implausible script. The most noteworthy thing in the film is Bernard Herrmann's score."
3,Hitchcock Lite,"The Trouble With Harry is an average movie with a couple of bright spots. It is certainly appealing to see a very young and vibrant Shirley MacLaine. She is quite the scene stealer in this film. John Forsythe is very amusing as an eccentric artist with little interest in selling his photos. This 1955 film is not in the top of the Hitchcock body of work; however, it is worth seeing to get an even closer gift at the dark side of Hitch's humor. I notice that there are many 5 star reviews for this movie which I think is more about respect and admiration for the director than for the film itself. Certain directors tend to get byes when they make an average film. This is an average movie that is in the 3 to 3.5 star range. Recommended for Hitchcock fans."
4,The Trouble With Harry,"Who killed Harry? Just when you're sure you know, someone else pops up with a plausible story. Shirley MacClaine makes a wonderful screen debut. The colors of Vermont shine through, but the untold story of unforseen bad weather and pasting leaves on trees on a set to recreate the originally planned location and how Alfred Hitchcock was nearly killed himself by falling equipment, makes the end product even more fascinating. A wonderful ensemble cast adds to the fun of digging up the body ""one more time."" A favorite to watch again just for the fun of it."
4,I like it. It's a charming comedy.,"Who killed Harry? A number of people in a small-town are sure they accidentally did, so they decide to bury him. But there's always a reason to dig him up again, bury him again, dig him up again... I like this movie. It has beautiful autumn colors, a funny story, excellent cast, and good music by Bernard Herrmann, who later made the music to a number of Hitchcock's movies (`Vertigo', `North by Northwest' and `Psycho' to mention some). This is not the kind of comedy that makes you laugh hysterically, but it has some funny parts and it is a very charming movie. I recommend you to see it!"
3,Quaint and pastoral,"The views of the New England countryside takes you to a time and era that we will never see again. I think the story was a little drawn out, though. I thought it was going to be funnier. It's also a little creepy that there is nobody in this little village except a few people who walk everywhere. Where are they walking?"
3,"This May Sound Blasphemous, But I Wasn't Wild About This.","Hitchcock has never, ever, made a bad movie. 1955's ""The Trouble With Harry"" is actually a pretty competent film, but when paired next to ""North by Northwest"" or ""Rear Window,"" this film falls conspicuously short. It's a dark comedy set in New England where a dead corpse is found and a group of town residents spend the entire film debating what to do with it. Should they report to local authorities? Should they keep it a secret? And, most of all, who killed him? John Forsythe and Shirley MacLaine (in her film debut) make appealing apprearances, and they do the best they can with the material they have. And the score by Bernard Herrmann is easily the best thing here. Yet, I wanted this film to push my buttons the way ""Psycho"" and ""Frenzy"" did, and I ended up mildly disappointed. Hitchcock diehards should give this a look, but the ""trouble"" with this ""Harry"" is that there's nothing extraordinary about it for me to recommend to casual viewers."
2,One of Hitchocks Not-so-good movies,"I bought this video because I am collecting the Hitchcock movies, but I was rather disappointed when I watched it. It is a rather unusual movie, a completely different style than his previous ones. It is made to be a comedy-mystery, shown by how Harry was constantly being dug up and burried again. Some parts of the movie were fairly good, but I didn't find it too humourous. I would recommend this movie to people who have rather ""silly"" sense of humours, or to people who just want to watch or collect as many Hitchcocks as possible."
2,Trouble with Hitchcock,"Alfred Hitchcock always had a soft spot for his misfires; perfectionist that he was, he probably wondered what went wrong and how he could have fixed it. ""The Trouble with Harry"" is one of those: an embarassingly clumsy comedy that just doesn't work at all. A man is shot under unseen and unexplained circumstances and the humor is supposed to spring from how the residents of a small Vermont village deal with him. The only moments of real comedy are the romantic byplay between John Forsythe and Shirley MacLaine. ""There are some things I just don't like to do by myself,"" she tells him in a hilarious double-entendre. Bernard Herrman's fine score and Saul Steinberg's graphic credits are wasted."
3,Hitch,"Well...First North By NW and now Harry.I guess it just an age thing. I am 52 and accustom to more ""modern"" dialog I guess. I gave ""Gone With The Wind"" to our library after spending 25 bux on it.These older movies are just laborious to watch. I am not into ""action"" movies, and do not compare everything to Terminator 2. I loved watching Open Range with Costner and Duval.But these old Hitchcock films are a chore. I think A LOT of them would do well if they were made today. What must have passed for ""clever"" back then is almost ridiculous when heard with todays ears.Trouble With Harry was an orgy for character actors. The BEST thing about this movie was the Beautiful scenery and camera work. I would have rather watched THAT for 2 hours.Buy it as cheap as you can.best"
3,Disappointing Experiment,"Hitchcock wanted to do something different this time around, but THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is uneven and tedious at times. Shirley MacLaine is terrific in her screen debut, Edmund Gwenn is great, as usual, and even Jerry Mathers (no, NOT as the Beaver) gives a good performance. But, at 100 minutes, it's overlong and the endless unearthing and burying of poor Harry grates after a while. However, it's a beautiful film, with superb color and a great score by the always wonderful Bernard Herrmann."
3,oddly appealing,"Who would think a body could cause this much trouble and be so entertaining? But Harry is pleasant fun - not an outright comedy, perhaps, but full of good humor - Hitchcock style."
4,Interesting and overlooked film.,"More than likely if you have seen this film you are a fan of Hitchcock. I doubt this film is seen by the more casual film viewer. While by no means Hitchcocks greatest film it is a very good one. The light humor and budding relationships between Forsythe & Maclaine and Gwynn & Natwick work well in this murder mystery. The scenery is beautiful. I agree with one of the previous viewers, the theatrical trailer is cheesy. I guess the producers of this DVD could not locate the orginal 1955 trailer. The scenery in this film is, also as stated by others, beautiful. This film should be viewed by any Hitchcock or mystery fan."
4,A FINE BLACK COMEDY.,"The trouble with Harry is that he's dead. A thoroughly eccentric film (even for Hitch), it was not a success when first released back in 1955, perhaps because it's droll humour was misunderstood by the massess who preferred something more obvious and exciting. The film clearly shows that death may be beneficial to the living, since these characters do not know each other before Harry's death and develop deep mutual affection through their common cause. Edmund Gwenn is terrific as usual and Mildred Natwick was a natural scene stealer. Shirley McLaine made her film debut in this admittedly oddball film & she's a most unlikely Hitchcock heroine!"
4,Pleasant suprise,"I bought ""Crecendo"" from Massimo Di Cataldo a couple of years ago, it was good album, I thought I'd get the next one. When I listened to ""Dieci"", I was blown away! This is one of the coolest albums out there. His vocals are amazing and the passion in his voice can not be ignored. Every song in this album is the one you could listen to over and over! Listen to this guy you won't regret it. A great buy!"
3,Sounds good aestheticaly lacking,"The build quality is very good. The sound quality is good, although a little light in the bass department as expected. I bought them as a cheaper alternative to the RM30. I wall mounted 3 of them next to my plasma tv as fronts and center. The titanium color is three shades of gray-metalic. I believe that the darker pewter color choice would have been a better match for my plasma."
1,Do not buy this book,"I am a PhD student, and had to buy this book because it is the textbook for the ""Advanced Semiconductor Devices"" course.The book has been nothing but a pain in the neck. The equations are not properly derived, there is insufficient information given for students to be able to solve the problems given at the end of the chapters.The author frequently introduces new variables, and describes them with an equation without giving any idea of where that equation is coming from.Do not buy this book. Im sure any other book would be alot better. If this is the textbook for your class, then I guess you are forced to buy it. Best of luck!"
4,"Great content, some typos, could use some formatting.","This book is very rich in content, covers in great detail a lot of very important and current concepts in semiconductor devices, it has some typos, though. I don't know exactly what kind of word processor Dr. Liou used to type this book, but any current word processor would've made a better job in typing equations, and giving a better format to this book. Anyway this is a very good reference for any person who is serious about semiconductor devices."
4,SPEAK TO MY HEART:A NOVEL,"SPEAK TO MY HEART was, a pretty good book I hated the fact that, SERENA had wasted all that time with her mom ,but sometimes that is the way life goes. I hope people get the point not to do what she did!I don't know all of what I would do if my mom came to me and told me that, my dad was not the man I thought he was,but one thing I do know is that, I would not have wasted all that time.You live,you, learn and you move on in her case,she moved on with a good man at her side."
5,Get your tissue ready!,"This book will have you laughing, crying and saying ""Amen!"" Stacy Hawkins Adams is a master at pulling at your heart strings with words. Warning: Don't start this book if you have somewhere to go or something to do right away - you'll want to finish the book in one sitting...it's that good! I can see this book being the next big blockbuster movie in Hollywood. Move over Tyler Perry, here comes Stacy.Pam Perry,Chocolate Pages Review"
4,Good fit,"This battery was a good fit for my Connex 900 AVR UPS which I use for my computer. Unfortunately, the last battery replacement that I did (which was not purchased from Amazon) only lasted one year. The original battery lasted 3 years. Only time will tell if this battery has any better longevity, but for now it is working as it should."
5,Works Great!,Got this battery for my daughters motor scooter & it works wonderfully! Great product & will order from them again! :)
3,OK,"The battery was the correct size and shipped promptly but did not have the connectors in the correct place nor were they the correct type. When I tried to return the batteries, I had to go through the vendor and not through Amazon. It took longer than usual to get an exchange. This was not my usual Amazon experience."
1,Bait & Switch - Received a different battery altogether,"Stay away from this one if you actually want PowerSonic PS-12120 batteries. I received ""Power Pile"" batteries instead of what I ordered. Yes, by spec they seem to be almost a direct replacement, but I ordered what I did for a reason. I have used PowerSonic batteries many times in the past and trust them. Who knows what the results will be with ""Power Pile"". I was under the gun to get a scooter back in operation for an elderly family member, so I installed these and now hope for the best. Also, the battery connectors on what I received are not a direct match for the PowerSonic model, so I had to use adapters to make the connections properly. I will not be buying from this vendor again as I feel advertising and selling one item then delivering something altogether different is unethical."
2,Packaged badley,The battery fit the package snugly. The top of the battery butted up against the carton. The battery terminals were missing the red and black plastic caps. As result the terminals were bent down. The less important sides had peanuts. They need a larger carton so the top and bottom could also be protected by bubble wrap or peanuts.
5,"It was in very good condition, just like it was described","This book was new and arrived on time. No damage or bent or wrinkled. Its a very helpful book, I use it for my studies everyday."
5,good book to read for beginners,This book was recommended reading before I started my Reiki training. It was a very very helpful book since I was just beginning my journey with Reiki. I now have more in depth books about gems but this is a great starter book for anyone willing to learn.
3,A very good book for beginners!,I enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and understand. Especially good for beginners in Reiki.
4,Liberated from the subculture,"Great book that will help liberate Christians from the Christian subculture that has abandoned its call to shape culture for the well being and flourishing of the greater human community. The Church needs to reclaim its place in the culture as a contributor to the arts, politics, law, and finance for the glory of God and the gladness of his creation. Very provocative."
1,Irritating,"When the herioine isn't arguing, competing or fighting with the hero, she's just plain annoying. The two are so mistrustful of each other, it's amazing they ever get together. Well, they never got together for me because I stopped reading 2/3 way through, which I don't do very often. There are no elements of the regency period, other than perhaps running away from a forced marriage. Ugh!"
1,Dire and dull,"This couple had nothing in common except being members of the human race, though with the way they behaved toward each other that was often debatable.The author struggled hard to get Rafe to have depth, but he just seemed a shallow playboy, and the potential rape, torture murder was just too heavy handed, especially juxtaposed as it was with all of her absurd angst over the slimy worm who let her down. I hated the heroine, the near love making scenes just got to be too much after a while. By the time thy did the deed I cold not have cared less about either of them. With the way the heroine behaved, it was a wonder no one put her in the madhouse before that, she was such a shrew. A badly written failure."
2,Disappointing,"I usually enjoy Allison Lane books. ""The Rake and the Wallflower"" is a favorite of mine. But ""The Madcap Marriage""... what a confusing jumble of a story. I wanted to like the hero and heroine. But I felt like I never got to know them. The story jumped around so much I felt I lost the point several times. I'm not sure there was ever a defining moment when the characters' love became apparent. There was lust in abundance. But love and trust were difficult to find in this book. Too many threads, subplots, misunderstandings, characters, etc. to make this an enjoyable read for me."
2,Wimpy!,"Was hoping that this would be similar to one I had,but it was not.This bra is pretty,but very thin and cheap.It stretches way too much,and has almost no support.It won't stay down and rolls up.Would not buy another."
3,At first excites then gets more like Muzak,Starts to be quite a new sound but the more I listen to it the more it sounds the same or maybe like Muzak
4,relaxing music,I heard this band live at the Montreal Jazz Festival this summer and bought the CD. The performance was more lively. The music on the CD is more laid back and is an excellent CD to add to a collection of International music. I found it very easy to listen to. It is an especially good CD to have on while sitting down for dinner with a glass of wine. Enjoy!
2,Even more repetitive than their first CD...,"NovaMenco has a couple of really hot flamenco riffs, and they play them to death. This music on this CD is so repetitive that it becomes as annoying as a record player needle stuck in a groove.If you want to hear a real master of this genre, check out Oscar Lopez."
2,MOMENTS MISSED F O R E V E R..............,"This camera is compact and versitile, however, I have missed alot of moments by getting more then half of my picture's 'smeared' OR 'blurred'. I just open the shutters, point and shoot! Some times it takes the picture right away and sometimes it takes a second or two before it reacts. By then, the picture has already changed! I've missed alot of precious moments of my birthing, my infant and my family due to the quality of this camera and delay of the shots! I dread using my camera because of my bad experience and dissapointment in the quality after developing my pictures (which are expensive and not worth it in the end)! I wish I could say better things about this camera, but I'm definately convinced that this camera is a LEMON!"
4,Great Little(and I mean Little) Camera,"So small you hardly know it's there...when I first used the camera, I was skeptical because of the size. Lo and behold, when I got the first roll developed, it was great. This is a great 2nd camera. You can take it anywhere and not miss a photo op."
4,"For the price, for the size, hard to beat","First used this camera at the Las Vegas CES show last month, all pictures came out perfect, including all the night scenes. I used the 400 speed film indoors and 200 speed film outdoors; had no problem with the flash by observing the maximum distances outlined by the guide. It's light to carry and simple to use. The only shortcomings are the tiny buttons to switch flash modes - I have to use my keys or toothpick to depress them. I got this camera from another retailer (Wxxxxxx) at a lesser price."
3,Small is beautiful,"Small and handy camera, very comfortable, fit in your pocket, great for outdoor use with plenty of sunlight. However the result not too good for indoor use with low light (ASA 400 didn't help much). For optimal result in outdoor use Wide Angle mode (H Print). Have fun."
5,Great Camera,"great camera, i bought it here and its given me the best pictures of all my previous cameras, it fits in your pocket, and is the size of a pager, with the width of 2 pagers. nice handy camera, film cost is alittle more, but well worth getting great panoramic pictures!"
2,Mediocre,"I took this camera to Paris, my first time there, some of the photos were great and the others were awful. It could be user error since I am not very good with cameras. I recently purchased my first digital camera, a panasonic.Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3S 7.2MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)I love it and it is easy to use. I would not choose this camera unless you are very mechanically inclined."
5,Treat Yuourself,"I don't know why more (any?) Americans are not familiar with this French Singer. I think this is consistently fantastic and have enjoyed all her albums, including Derriere La Porte. Do yourself a favor and give her a chance."
5,Another great album by Jil Caplan,"I too have been enjoying Jil Caplan's music since the late 80s and ""Derriere La Porte"" is wonderful. Her voice shines as always and in this particular album the bassline is more prominent. Though I hardly know any French, the way it is sung and inflected by Jil makes me ""feel"" that beautiful language."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Despite being Hitchcock's personal favorite of his films, Shadow of a Doubt is an uneventful film which generates little tension and misses a lot of opportunities; I love Hitchcock but I must advise you to pick another one of his films."
5,Hitchcok!!!!!!,"There is soo much depth in this movie it's not even funny. At times it seems a bit corny(Mother and Little Charlie) but the irony between the Uncle and the Family flip flop the happy corny scenes in ways that effect and that magnify the darker ones. Very misunderstood by many poeple. It requires many viewings. I actually shed a tear when Charlie was crying on the Porch, and I'm an 18 year old man. And I was watching it alone"
4,Ron Sullivan of Philly-half right only,"""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a favorite Hitchcock of mine for several reasons: Joseph Cotten's dark 'arch-angel's thunderclouds' covering small town americana, both his and Teresa Wright's performances(as well as the supporting cast), the love that Hitch put into this one shows through the camera, great dialogue, and a very eerie feel-especially for this time period. However, the ending is pretty standard Hollywood(this may have had something to do with David Selznick or the system in general). Still, another review, by Ron Sullivan of Philadelphia, complained about the lack of features(Universal DVDs are never well-done). Also, though, he complained that this one had not been given the full treatment of a wide-screen presentation. Ron, wide-screen format was not available in Hollywood for another decade(outside of a few special cases). There never was a wide-screen copy of this film, therefore. That is too bad, though. Still, it just wasn't there."
4,Shadow Of A Doubt is Hitchcock's first artistic masterpiece,"Shadow Of A Doubt truly is the first Hitchcock film where the viewer can first witness how well this great director uses sounds and sets to evoke emotion from the viewer. Cotton and Wright are perfectly cast, with Cotton particularly eerie as the ""perfect"" uncle. Hitchcock takes the viewer from a comfortable position and throws them into a horrible ""what if"" situation. What if that favorite relative of yours was capable of something evil? I think that the way Hitchcock used sound and setting in this movie only heightened the suspense. The quiet town...the perfect family is the backdrop for murder and secrets. His use of sound during the dinner party (cups clanking, etc.) are eerie and cheery all at the same time. The scene where Charlie discovers the horrible past of her Uncle...and then watches him merrily jump up the porch steps to play with her brother....is bloodchilling."
4,Watch your Step,"Here is another black and white classic of suspense from the master of the genre Alfred Hitchcock. Take the multi-talented actor, Joseph Cotton, who plays the role here of a homicidal man who cannot control his impulses. And in fact has made something of a philosophy of life out of it. Take a nave, if bright, niece played by Theresa Wright who finally stumbles on to his mysterious and fatal doings. Place them in middle class Santa Rosa California in the 1940's and surround them with a very conventional family and you can take it from there. The real suspense here centers on family pride and maybe just the slightest bit of doubt that Cotton is a real killer. Well you can figure the rest for yourselves."
4,5 star movie ...,"While the film itself is absolutely brilliant, 'Shadow of a Doubt' loses a star for being a disappointing DVD. Considering this film was always hailed as being Hitchcock's favorite, I'm really surprised that Universal didn't roll out the red carpet when it came to the disc's bonus features.I completely expected to see the same TLC that made the 'Rear Window', 'Vertigo', and 'Psycho' DVDs such an education to watch. Instead Universal didn't even seem to think 'Shadow of a Doubt' warranted a simple wide-screen format.I loved the film and will always think of it as one of my favorites among Hitch's works. I can't help but to be disappointed that it seemed to fall to the way-side when it came to the attention I felt it should have commanded in its reproduction and formatting though."
4,Suspenders,"Love Hitchcock. Teresa Wright is 40's gorgeous. Suspense great, but not his Greatest, thus 4star rating. but very well done."
2,Couldn't Get Involved,"I normally like Hitchcock, but couldn't' get involved in this... even started it again to see if I was missing something...."
2,Shadow of a Doubtful Transfer,"I've seen worse transfers but this one is not great. The opening titles are cut-off, they start with the director's credit and the film begins. The gray range is OK from black to white but it appears that this transfer is from a video that had ""Time-Compression"" used on it. As you watch in some panning shots there appears to be a ""strobing"" movement, a bit jerky, like we used to see on old TV shows that needed to get more commercials in the time slot. Get the Universal product for this film...much better!"
4,Good Hitchcock suspicion film,"SHADOW OF A DOUBT was an interesting movie where Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is being assumably chased by two men who believe either he or a man on the East Coast is a ""Merry Widow"" murderer, and he goes to the rest of his family to hide, yet he still is in terrible suspicion and possible danger.As the story winds on, he tries to have a nice time with Teresa Wright, but they don't seem to keep together. Still, the story has a creepy hint to it, and when the ending approaches, the film is even more scary, so you shouldn't miss this exciting film."
3,Slight Disappointment,"I find it hard to believe that Shadow of a Doubt is even considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best film. Although he was a brilliant director, the suspense of this film is minimal while the plot can leave you uninterested. Joseph Cotton plays the beloved ""Uncle Charlie"", who pays a visit to his older sister and her family. Meanwhile his adoring niece is tipped off by a detective that her uncle is a serial killer. Some undeveloped references to telepathy and an unintended, yet apparent sexual chemistry between Uncle and Niece just added to the things I did not like about this film. Shadow of a Doubt may be a masterpiece to film majors, but for an average moviegoer like myself, this film is no greater than any other - and definitely nothing special."
5,Superb!,"""Shadow of a Doubt"" is nothing short of chilling. The story itself is very disturbing. It's about a family in a peaceful, small town, who are excited about a visit from their favorite relative. However, ""Uncle Charlie"" turns out to be the notorious ""Merry Widow Murderer"". The characters a smart and deep, the dialouge is witty, and the suspense creschendos right up the the nail-biting climax. The film is also a disturbing look at morality and values in the life of a working class family. This is a thriller that will haunt you forever, trust me. Just as potent, if not more, than any modern thriller. One of my favorite films directed by Alfred Hitchcock."
1,"Great film, very bad quality DVD","This ""Shadow of a Doubt"" so-called COLLECTOR'S EDITION w/release date of May 28, 2009 is C-R-A-P quality. I knew it as soon as the credits began, FF'd a bit then took the disk out and threw it away. Later did a google search for quality reviews and have ordered another version (2006 release) from another company. ""Big D Films"" is the studio that released the crap edition; I'd think it illegal to do so. Amazon should not be selling this. Amazon customer reviews for DVDs should be for the exact product one is buying, i.e., that edition, not just a general film review."
1,Awful Copy,"Beware of this copy, very bad quality despite the so-called ""enhancement"" claims! Fantastic film, horrible copy. I for one will never be buying anything from Triad Productions again!"
1,Beware!,"I received this DVD through Amazon as a Christmas present and when I sat down to watch it with my family, I noticed that instead of easing into the film with a menu and then the credits, it jumped directly into the film, with some strange digital glitches at various points. Later, the film jumped into an endless loop as it couldn't progress through the video then jumped back to the beginning of that scene. I know there's nothing wrong with my DVD player and upon closer inspection of the DVD, it doesn't have the familiar silvery reflective surface, characteristic of a commercially produced DVD, but a purple coloration, characteristic of a home burned DVD. I think the distributor that's supplying these to Amazon needs to be investigated because I'm convinced this is a bootlegged DVD. Buyer beware."
4,Cute Book About Grandparents!,Grandma thinks her grandkids are just perfect and they aren't naughty at all. Young kids will find a lot to smile about as will grandparents and parents. Charming!
5,sweet,great band i had never heard any of their music before. very impressed with it so far. great deal!!!
5,It's a juvenil french rap bomb,"Like they said in france:""c'est de la bombe"" Busta flex is one of the young star of french rap. He is the better in improvisation. The conceptor of this Lp (koll shen) is the most professional in France. Get it now before the explosion of flex baba!"
4,I liked the product.,"Hello, my language is Spanish, but use google to translate.in English.The product I liked, but the transportation to Colombia has cost me U.S. $ 100, goods repackaged in a large box and I charge by volume. If quizzes 10 items packaged as small as possible, what is the volume discount package and tendira to buy 10 Swagman Whee Pod Rear Bike Carrier.in SpanishEl producto me ha gustado, pero el trasporte a colombia me ha costado $us 100, biene reempacado en una caja muy grande y me cobran por volumen. si quiciera 10 articulos empacados lo mas reducido posible, cuanto seria el volumen del paquete y que descuento tendira para compra 10 Swagman Whee Pod Rear Bike Carrier"
5,Really like this carrier,"I haven't had this carrier long but I love it so far. It is not large and imposing as some other trunks. It's just the right size for my trike. The clasps are made with cheap looking plastic as others have stated in reviews but I am hoping that with special care they will hold up. I purchased it to carry my U-lock, cables, snacks and some gear for the kids when on riding trips. I don't plan on keeping anything in it that is worth stealing so I really am not interested in the lock feature. I was interested in this carrier primarily because of price, waterproof hard shell, and size. I plan on belting it shut if the clasps or lock break as stated in the other reviews. I really like this carrier a lot."
5,Whee Pod Rear Bike Carrier,I really like this rear carrier. I have bought 3 of them. One for me and two for friends. We all love them.
3,Good but...,"Swagman Whee Pod Rear Bike CarrierGood, convenient product, easy to install but one of the flimsy plastic clips that keeps it closed just popped off while I was riding and disappeared."
1,Mostly on Software Engineering; very little on IEC 6113,"This book is not worth the price. Half the book is on common information regarding Software Engineering e.g. Software cycle, process & quality. The other half book hardly discuss anything new regarding IEC 1131. I would consider it a summary of IEC 1131 and the book lacks substance or depth. R. W. Lewis or Karl-Heinz John & Michael Tiegelkamp are all better than this book."
3,Poor written English is an unfortunate distraction,"Unfortunately none of the authors are native English speakers, and it shows - seems more like it was translated from Italian by an automatic translation tool. Quite a few basic typos unrelated to the translation issue also. Although all of this really comes down to the editor not doing their job - can't blame the authors for having English as a second language."
1,Quality Problem,"If you have been looking for a clock radio with a CD player that is of good quality and costs less than $200, you must be very frustrated like I was. Why is it so hard to make a clock radio with CD for under $200?I bought this one and returned it shortly after I received it. Its CD player didn't play. Its forward button didn't work so that you have to push the rewind button 59 times if you want to set the time 1 minute ahead. It is obvious that this manufactuerer has a quality problem because the odds for two things to go wrong simultaneously on a new product should be extremely low.By the way, if you haven't found your radio clock yet, check out the Teac SL-D88 clock radio. I am happy that I was forced to do more searching and found that one."
1,junk,I boght this radio from a catalog a friend had I paid $69 for it same problems as others static FM cd did not open right plus the LED went blank after 2 days sent it back and got a Teac
1,Bad Design,"The alarm would not shut-off for 8 hours, it has to be the worse design of product that requires you to keep a reference manual by it side, in order to operate. The secret functions have no labels at all. It is a design that is counter-intuitive.Do not get buy it at all."
5,Best Mouse Ever,"These are truly wonderful mice, you forget you even have it in your hand, very fast, responsive and intuitive. Never will buy another brand."
5,"Durbin recreates the dismal world that many of the 250,000 Finnish immigrants faced a hundred years","In 1905, fifteen year old Otto, his mother and two younger sisters, leave the grandparents behind in Finland to join with his father who's laboring in an iron ore mine in Hibbing, Minnesota. The poor family suffers through an excruciating voyage only to land in a squalid mining camp where Father faces mortal danger six days a week below ground. Otto eventually joins his dad in the mines as the family scrimps and saves to buy a farm. The harsh life, fueled by corruption and corporate callousness, gave rise to the organized labor movement that eventually unionized our mining industry.Author William Durbin, a high school English teacher in Hibbing, recreates the dismal world that many of the 250,000 Finnish immigrants faced a hundred years ago after escaping the Russian Army and trying to get a foothold in the American dream."
4,Chatty but useful look at Havel's life.,"Havel, president of the Czech Republic, first president of free Czechoslovakia after the Velvet Revolution, is portrayed in an attractive light by Kriseova, who evidently knows Havel fairly well. In any event, the glossary of names is useful for anyone trying to get a better grip on the personalities involved in Theater of the Balustrade and in the Velvet Revolution. A fast paced read, indexed. OP hunters: St. Martin's imprint is also on some versions of this book"
1,some boys do,Sorry its been so long since I watched it that I guess it didn't leave me with a lasting impression!!!
1,Really!?!,OMG! I have learned a valuable lesson about checking the reviews BEFORE I rent! I can not say it any better than these others! This movie - and I use that term loosely - was the most disappointing thing I have ever rented. Granted I don't know much about these actors but I have a difficult time calling them that! I at no time detected a plot and certainly what little sex there was had no redeeming value to it! I feel ripped of and will not waste another dime or minute with this one!
1,Words cannot express...,"...how utterly terrible this movie was. It did not have a single redeeming quality. I can deal with low budget, but this movie has faults that can't be blamed on the budget. The acting was terrible-- a couple of the actors in particular were just awful. And the story was totally incoherent. Really-- if your only choices are to watch this movie or clean the bathroom, clean the bathroom"
1,Yarg...,Lasted about twenty minutes into this floater....plus the transmission was putrid. Chop stop chock restart.....time out again....yarg...the actors were annoying bu the writting was just plain dense and made no sense...why did they have a dialog when the door bell rings over and over...and more useless babble...argh.
1,Don't waste the $1.99 Please Dont!,"Waste of time completely. Only one frontal. Shaky camera during most of the scenes. Too dark in so many places. Dumb writing. Stupid directing. Only at max 2 cute guys, at MAX. Do not even waste your time. Google the one hot guy to find the nude pic. Not worth it. We're talking like one flash of frontal, like that's it. Not even worth spending 5 cents on."
3,Makita LS1214FL Miter Saw,"Ok I owen & opperate a Int.Trim Co. we do high end custom homes and spec.production homes thru out South Florida.Between myself & the guys we have used just about all the saws on the market and this one falls somewhere in the middle of the road.I have two issues with this saw the first being that the stops @ each miter have to much play about 1 Deg. to the left or the right of each angle unless you lock the saw down each time.The other is that the guard catches the long point of a compound miter on any crown over 5 1/4"" cut from the end of the material.So I am not sure if I am into this saw or not it has only been a month and I think I still like my Dewalt better .Time will tell .All and all it is a nice saw"
5,"Versatile, powerful, and accurate.","The saw is well built, easy to use, and produces very consistent results. When used with the right blade, it will make quick cuts cleanly. It handles wood that is too thick for a 10"", and cuts reasonably wide pieces. The laser helps speed alignment, and the fluorescent light helps locate marks that are a little on the faint side. When cutting, it has no problem cutting quickly without torquing left or right. The stock blade that comes with the saw is actually a pretty nice blade. The table and fence are well-built, but really this saw needs a stand to really take full advantage of the capabilities of this saw."
1,"Nice saw, cheap fence, poor customer service",THis is a sweet saw until it broke. The fence shattered in three different places within a few days of opening the box. Customer service was not concerned that their components did not stand up to regular use. The parts had quality i would expect of an inferior tool manufacturer.
4,Still in one piece!!,"Much like the previous people that purchased this saw, mine arrived in a badly damaged box. In fact, the box was held together with 5 strips of packaging tape in one of the corners. Upon opening, I did not see any visible damage to the saw (still in one piece!!) and all parts seem accounted for. I wonder if I'm receiving a saw that was previously returned by someone else? I brought it home, plugged it in and started cutting. No problems. The factory blade does cut very nicely. I have not checked if it is square."
4,Just lucky,"This is an excellent saw. My one and only issue with it is the miter scale being on the side. Just not used to that. But I gotta tell ya, how this thing arrived undamaged is beyond me. It has to be, without a doubt, one of the poorest packaged items I've ever received. Especially considering the nature and weight. I feel very fortunate that it arrived safely, for I guarantee there were many which didn't."
2,good seeds but gravel bits,"I wasn't thrilled because I had to pick out tiny bits of gravel. The flax seeds themselves were fine, top quality. If it weren't for the gravel bits (that get through the sieve w/the seeds, I guess?), this would get 5 stars."
5,A Great Film!!!,"Considering the millions of dollars that are poured into Hollywood films these days its amazing that a film that couldn't have cost much to make, has such an incredible impact. Once Were Warriors relies on emotion and very human situations and not special effects to hold your attention;and does it hold it. I've never seen a movie that at times can be so disturbing but at others so uplifting. What makes this movie special to me is the way the family goes through such tragedy and how they pull together, especially the mother who finally has the strength to get away from the destructive forces in her and her childrens lives. This is a movie that you will think about for days afterward and if you can get through the ugly parts it is truly a great film."
5,From a New Zealander's point of view,"Once Were Warriors is a realistic, unedited version of true family life for some, Maori and otherwise. This movie shows a regular family, and real life situations, and the acting by Temuera Morrison (Jake), Rena Owen, Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell, Julian Arahanga, and Taungaroa Emile is outstanding. I'm proud that this is a product of NZ, and Lee Tamahori."
1,wouldn't even play,The blu-ray disc won't even play. I have tried it in several blu-ray players and it gets 21 seconds into the icon entertainment logo then stops. I emailed the manufacturer over a month ago and that have not responded. Very disappointing
4,We were once warriors,This movie is one of the best movie I have ever seen its not much for the acting. But the message and the storie line behind it. It's a great movie
5,Powerful & Gripping,"This is a powerful and gripping film that tells a story that is so true for many people. At times this movie is very difficult to watch as it portrays quite accurately depicts the consequences of domestic violence, rape, suicide, drug use, and gang life. Yet, it is almost impossible to look away. The acting is superb and the story telling. If you have never seen this movie it is a must see and will be sure to bring up dialogue with whoever you may watch it with."
4,Good movie for teaching volunteers about domestic violence,Wanted to educate volunteers for abused children about what some of the children's home lives were like who came from homes with domestic violence. This movie showed domestic violence. So the volunteer can have idea of what was considered normal for some of the children they want to help.
5,Maoris in the Hood,When I saw this movie I was astounded by the parrallels between the Maoris and Americas inner city. I've never been to New Zealand but the story could just as easily have been set in South Central LA. The story is completely compelling and I have recomended it to any one I knew that would listen.
3,New Zealand Domstic Violence,"This film has been praised for its emotional power. I thought it was violent and quite unpleasant to watch. If you like to see women be abused and watch macho men drink and act crudely, this is the movie for you. I would recommend another New Zealand film on the Maori culture, ""Whale Rider"" as being gentle and joyous with a far greater insight into the culture. That movie gets a 5 stars rating."
3,Love the movie but this DVD was NOT for region 1 and would not play in any DVD player,see above comment. DVD arrived in a timely manner but was not for region 1 which made it unplayable . Unfortunately I don't own a universal DVD player so the movie was unusable to me. Probably would have been great in a player that would play it
5,Great Film,"I first heard about this highly controversial and critically acclaimed film about a decade ago because of its vast amount of violent content... this movie is really well written, acted, directed... you're really going to enjoy watching this movie over and again... however, this film does have a lot of violence, including rape, incest, domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and much more... but this is still one of the best movies i've ever seen and i highly recommend it to everyone."
1,horrible transfer. wait for the US release,"I love this movie and am so surprised that no one is putting together a decent package together for it. i mean, it's such a brilliant film that an edition like this should not be allowed to see the light of day. the sound is in mono, the picture has cutts and dust all over. too dark at times. where is Criterion when you need them. you're better off buying the vhs edition. way better. this edition does no justice to what Tamahori intended us to see. avoid it (...). a rippoff in every sense."
3,Memorable,Once Were Warriors tells the story of a Maori family that is kept down by a violent father. This may seem like a simple and unoriginal movie but this type of drama film has never been better executed than in this film. Temuera Morrison gives a convincing performance as the abusive husban/father. Rena Owen plays the mother well and all of the kids also do a nice job particulary the actors for Grace and Nig Heke. Even the some of the husband's friends stand out in their roles. The film does occasionally get overdramatic but it has a satisfying ending. The film is strenghted due to how well some of the themes tie in with the Maori culture.
5,Region 2 DVD is fine,"Just wanted to say that my region 2 DVD does not have thepermanent chinese subtitles described by others.I think Amazon's ""import"" region 1 DVD (however that would work -- where would it be imported from!!!) sounds like it's really a Video CD. They have unremoveable chinese subtitles, and (...) visuals (MPEG1, not MPEG2 like DVD).Get a region 2 import, if your player can handle it."
5,A Fantastic Drama! One of my all time favorites!,"You just feel for this family. I guess it hit closer to home for me because this family did in some ways remind me of mine, especially Jake the Muss who has to be one of my all time favorite movie characters. He comes off as so ferocious and vicious at times, yet can have some endearing moments although the real him always comes out. Rena Owen is ALL WOMAN in this movie as she struggles mightily to keep her family together in the modern world after abondoning her heritage.If you haven't seen it, you must. It's that good.**Favorite Scenes: any part with the haka in it and Jake finding out the truth"
1,Run from this import version on DVD!!!!,This just happens to be one of my favorite films. I own a VHS copy and its incredible. The import DVD has scratches. This is a very poor transfer. Also the DVD doesn't allow you to get rid of the Chinese characters which are totally annoying. I will be sending this DVD back to amazon. Theres no actors bio or any extras. Shame on Amazon's quality control department to allow them to sell such a substandard product.
5,Once were worriors,"hi I come from New Zealand. Here is really quite a multi-cuatural place. Im 15,still at school. I think Once were worriors' reflects with some of the lives some families cope with here and all over the world. i have a bit of moari in me as well as European. I know my self i was in a family that coped with serious abusefrom my dad. He left when i was 5. I say this because i have read some real negitive things about this movie saying ""it never happens that type of abuse"" well it does,it happens to kids and their families all the time. I think the movie is real emotional butit's the total coolest.I only saw it once , but those actors are the best and the realness"
5,Don't Sleep On This....,"This movie was one of the best movies I ever saw. I stumbled upon this movie one night when my little cousins were watching it on cable. All I have to say is, if you haven't seen it, do so right now!"
4,It gets worse yet...,As gritty as New Zealand films get (Unfortunatly...) this film presents it's central themes within a slick and tight structure. A Fierce melodrama which should serve as a model for many New Zealand films to come (Interesting to note that many South Aucklanders felt the film glamorised what really happens in South AK)
1,GREAT FILM TERRIBLE DVD DON'T BUY IT!,I've waited a long time for the DVD to this great film. The DVD is a very poor transfer from a scratched dirty print with Chinese subtitles. Amazon should list the fact that this is a Hong Kong import and the viewer cannot get rid of the subtitles since they are on the transferred print.Wait for a domestic version of this DVD and avoid this import! I will be returning my disc ASAP.
4,Amazing movie - very powerful,"Great film, disturbing & powerful showing the lives of a family in New Zealand - can't wait to see what happens next!! Part 2 is out & I'm renting no buying it on Amazon!"
3,Hard to be excited about this....,"Originally released September 14, 2010 at the Toronto International Film Festival; Broadcast as an HBO Special on October 7th 2010 and finally released to the public on November 16th 2010 as part of a 6 disc Box set:The Promise: The Darkness On The Edge of Town Story (3 CD/ 3 Blu-ray)orThe Promise: The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Story (3 CD/3 DVD)Fast Forward 4 months - Now it will be available as a stand alone DVD or Blu-ray format.But to show the true appreciation to those who supported Bruce and bought the original box set when it came out, they've seen fit to include additional material NOT included in Box set.In order to get these additional features, I'm expected to buy the stand alone release as well. I can't help but feel like I'm being taken for a ride."
1,"Come on, Bruce or Columbia or whoever","I too pre-ordered the box set last fall and can't believe that this extra material is on this disc but not the original. Given what we paid, IT JUST AIN""T RIGHT. I watched Bound for Glory, the Woodie Guthrie movie last week. Wonder what Woodie would be saying to Bruce about this."
1,Another rip off!,"Once again Bruce Inc see fit to rip off fans. Why could they have not released the complete Carousel show and maybe another '78 show and then added the Darkness doc as a 'bonus'. No, instead they release the doc again with a few extra tiny morsels and expect fans to buy it. Sorry, but this fan is fed up with having to buy these rip off releases and will be sticking with the bootleg(s)."
1,Shocking ripoff of fans,"Like many others here, I purchased the box set, now I find out there is a (really extraordinary) performance of some of the songs from ""The Promise"" included on the standalone disc that ARE NOT included with the box set. So, after we spend 100 bucks on the box set, we have to ALSO buy the standalone? This is complete BS, and unfortunately, Bruce (or his label or whoever) has pulled this previously as well (you buy Wrecking Ball on vinyl, you don't get bonus tracks, you buy ""Seeger Sessions,"" then a few months later another version comes out with a DVD and bonus tracks). This just ain't the right way to treat the fans."
1,Bruce is King! This is Robbery.,I too forked out the $100 + bucks for the lavish box set when it came out. Now Bruce / Columbia gonna try and squeeze another $15-$20 out of me so I can get 5 songs not in the original box? Come on BRUCE ... WTH ...
2,Another Generic LMP Label Offering,"Rather disappointed with this album, as it came highly recommended. What we have here is a very generic power metal offering. The band goes for a heavier vibe rather than the overly-pretty sound of many Euro-metal bands. Still, this doesn't really distinguish them from alot of what's out there- it just demonstrates that these guys listened to Accept as well as Helloween. The songs are interchangeable, all moving at a similar pace and featuring instantly forgettable lyrics. The one exception is the brilliant 'A Soldier's Tale', which opens with a great guitar flurry and rips along- it's the only track that sounds as though the band is really putting some heart into the song. Otherwise, just put Cryonic Temple on ice with all those other unoriginal LMP bands"
1,Little here for anyone - spend your money elsewhere.,"There is more marketing of Netscape technologies in the book than there is valuable information. The information in the book is severely dated; but even when it was ""fresh"" it was of no real value due to a lack of detail and explanation."
3,good but not great,"There are a few excellent essays here, including George Wright's on Shakespeare's verse, David Daniell's on the English Bible, and Norman Jones' fine overview of English history during Shakespeare's life. But overall the writing here tends to be rather technical and flat. Many of the essays are so over-specialized in content that they do little or nothing to illuminate Shakespeare's works, which is after all the purpose of this volume."
5,Excellent!,"As an adult, I found this DVD extremely helpful in mastering the basic skills. The tips are laid out in an easy to understand, sequential form that I apply to my training each and every class.The video is clear and concise and would be of great help to any gymnastics beginner.A strong 5 stars!"
2,Non-sequel,"I was hoping for some smattering of continuation from the original, i.e., Nicholas Cage investigates . . . .. No soap."
2,Lori Heuring is no Laura Harring!,"Lori Heuring is wrongly identified in the Amazon summary review of this so-so movie as starring Mulholland Drive. No, that was Laura Harring, who played the central character in MD and is as different from Lori as night and day.An interesting movie, kind of lumbers along, Tom Berenger is convincingly befuddled but the ending twist is a bid incredible."
3,Muay Thai Katas,The Tutorial they present are really very basic and can be composed by anyone.I really overpaid for this DVD . But if you are new to Training Muay Thai as an instructor and wish to add to your students training than it would be okay .
5,Good knife,"Thin blade and seems to stay sharp forever. I have had this knife forabout 4 years, works great. Great for veggies!"
3,Not quite what I expected,"The watch is not quite what I expected, but I'll keep it. The biggest complaint for me is that the Watch Information lists this watch as having a Buckle clasp. That is not the case, at least for the one I received. Mine came with a Velcro clasp, not the Buckle I was expecting. I also cannot get the Flix feature to work, even after reading the instructions 6 times. This audio alarms and sounds on this watch are extremely quiet, I never hear my watch beep or the alarm go off that I have set. The watch does look nice, but not all it's claimed to be."
3,Everything but what I needed.,"I bought this watch for a walk/run program. It has multiple interval alarms, which are easy to set up and work, but they are not nearly loud enough. Running outdoors I was unable to hear the alarms at least half the time.Everything else worked as advertised, but the alarms are useless for outdoor use."
1,Ironman .... my @$$,"Using the watch for running and interval training worked out fine. However, when I decide to test the ""Ironman"" claim is where the watch failed. A dip in not ever a foot of water was enough to fry the watch for good. Even though the watch claims to be good up to 100 meters. I was either given a fake or this watch is not ironman ready."
5,Great Novel...,"Don't want to repeat others, but this novel is very easy to read and while you are doing it you feel you are a part of that household, almost feeling the mood of all present characters.Highly recommend this book..."
5,Above and beyond,"As one who is slowly but surely building a collection of Everyman volumes, I was pleased beyond my expectations with this purchase.Well done."
3,An effort,"I know this is a Balzac classic, but I found it a bit of a grind (even though it is short). The story itself was overly simplistic, and the writing is very loose and dull. I won't be reading any Ballsack novels in the future."
3,Okay,I frankly didn't find this book to be that well written. And it was a little slow at times. But it is the best portrtait of the rich I've ever read. People often wonder when a billionaire doesn't stop working. The father in this book displays the characteristic that most rich do not relish in HAVING but GETTING. It's the making of money in-and-of-itself that is the thrill. The father just lives to make money. He's arguably wealthy as the result of a neurosis.
2,how the topic overshades art!!,"This book is a typical 19th century novel where the author writes how the cruelty of the system, the establishment and men in general, destroys the lifes of the idolized women. This book should have containd enought pathos to fill Balzac`s chest, but i`m afraid it did not, so I will restrain myself and others from reading further novels of such overdramatic, oversimplistic writing. Pardon me!"
5,super,i have unix cgi web exper........ but i still love to read a book where the author talks to u! he's great!
3,Appalled,"Two of the reviewers refer to the author as ""the only natural daughter"" of Bette Davis. So does being Bette's child by birth make her more her child than her adopted siblings? That's what the tone of that phrase implies. Adopted children are just as much someone's child as natural children. How insensitive you are to adopted children!"
1,Not well written,"I found this book poorly written, the writer Hyman not seeming to form coherent, concise thoughts in which to tell the reader a story. Her recollections and timeline seem jumbled and distracting. Admittedly, I was unable,or perhaps unwilling to sift through the entire monotonous tome, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is attempting to gain insight into the world of B.D. Hyman or her famous mother.I am glad I spent less than $3.00 for this book, although it was hardly worth even that amount."
1,Christina copycat,"B.D. wrote this book to ""open her mother's eyes before it was too late"", as the last reviewer questioned. That could have easily been done one-on-one, or with a professional mediator. Phone calls. -Not through a tell-all book given to Bette on Mother's Day! I read this forgettable book about ten years ago and I don't remember a word of it. It didn't stick with me or have any important impact or message like Christina Crawford's autobiography ""Mommie Dearest"" that actually had a point. Her's was not written out of revenge, she had a legitimate story. Will celebrity children please stop jumping on the Mommie Dearest bandwagon? Probably not. They earn a lot of money and we all want to know what *really* happened behind closed doors. But ""My Mother's Keeper"" falls flat."
2,keep it private,"i read this book many years ago. i have no doubt that Miss Hyman's youth was not idyllic and that perhaps Bette Davis was not mother of the year. but i do not understand why people have to air their personal family issues in a public forum.could she not have approuched her mother personally and talked with her? why stab her in the back when she was in failing health? it is also well documented that Bette provided financially for Hyman and her family many times, bailing them out of bankrupcy. i'm sure the book was financially lucrative for Miss Hyman also. oh well, at least Bette had a son who was and is supportive of her and her legacy. many of us could write books about our parents and hand pick all the less than stellar times in our childhoods. we might even be able to make our parents look abusive. well, i guess Hyman has found true happiness in that cult they call born again Christianity. i doubt that she will ever wake up and realize her folly."
4,Ausgirl from Sydney,"This book kept me reading and not wanting to put it down! and I don't even like ""Bette Davis!"" except for her role in ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"". I spotted it in a used book store and after reading the first page, it had me hooked. It was written with humour as well as frankness. I can just imagine Bette Davis saying those exact words and phrases which B.D. writes. If you want to read a story that's told honestly from a daughters perspective about a Mother's obsessiveness with her and her family, mixed with humour and shock then I recommend you read this. You won't be disappointed."
2,Amusing Because It's So Bad--Consider It Fiction.,"Hyman published this book while her mother was on her deathbed, which shows exactly what kind of person she is: selfish and cruel. Yes, it's tough being the wealthy daughter of a famous celebrity who could be too raucous at times. Let me wipe the little tear from the corner of my eye. Hyman is such a twit that she finds her mother's passing off frozen macaroni & cheese as homecooked equally as offensive as alcoholism and suicidal tantrums. This book is her malicious, last ditch effort to drain more money out of her mother--if no longer directly from her pockets, then from her name. It reads like a campy amalgamation of all Davis' screen roles. And Hyman has the gall to claim this insulting 400pg diatribe was some sort of plea for reconciliation! Apparently, no one but the publishers bought that."
1,Yawn!,"This book wasn't interesting in the least, and I found myself more sympathetic to Bette than V.D.!P.S. Anyone else notice how all the good reviews are written in caps? I'm just saying....lolr.i.p. Bette!"
1,Bette should have given her up for adoption,"Bette Davis should have given BD up for adoption, preferably by Joan Crawford. What a terrible woman. BD, that is, not Bette."
1,very disappointing and disturbing,"I bought this used book for less than $1, just to see what it was about. and b.d. hyman really paints bette davis as a psycho, drunk, abuser and bipolar person. but yet at the same time, she still has her mother in her life. it's no wonder bette davis suffered a heart attack and stroke not too long after this book was published. but what's most ironic is that barbara davis is supposed to be a minister!! if you want to read this book, don't do the author any justice by buying it brand new, but pay the price that it's really worth!! 50 cents!"
2,My Mother's Keeper??,"First, let me say, I adore Bette Davis. I have read several books by her and about her. This book, written by her daughter, is harsh, to say the least. The book seems to be more about the daughter, than Bette Davis. She gives a hard look at life with Bette Davis. And I have to wonder how much of it is true. All of this, from her point of view, which seems tainted. Some of it, although intended to shed a bad light on her mother, makes the daughter look like a shrew. I read this to gain some insight into Bette Davis' life. I didn't. I would suggest skipping this one. It was a waste of my time."
1,Pure dribble,"This book was badly written by the self absorbed, greedy, daughter of Bette Davis. A complete waste of time.Hyman probably got religion after she woke up one day and realized how much she screwed over her own mother for a buck."
1,How to capitalize on your mothers name by B.D. Hyman,"To read this drivel you will only need the IQ of a 10 year old. Hyman does not show any talent for words. Quite possibly her sister, Margot, is not the only one in the family with a mental handicap. To read this, one is filled with a loathing, not for Bette Davis as the author would want, instead for the author herself. It fills me with disgust and pity for someone who would trash their mother, who from all accounts loved her very much. While reading this I didnt picture Ms Davis at all, instead I pictured Margo Channing. Hyman has gotten her mother confused with one of her most famous characters. Perhaps Hyman was chumming up with another particular author, and when she saw the cash flowing in she followed suit. At least Mommie Dearest was plausible. Dont waste your money or time, I sure regret that I did."
1,Pure garbage from a hack writer,"Do not waste your time on this piece of trash by a terrible writer. As has been said above, this book is nothing but lies about a great American film legend. It was written to make money off of you and me. BD Hyman is now runnning some get rich quick church, go figure."
3,A Shameful Book Of Lies by A Derranged Girl,"Almost everything pertaining to Better Davis is facinating. However, Mrs Hyman is clearly grasping at straws trying to slander her poor bedridden mother who was recovering from a stroke. Mrs. Hyman's motives are clear. She saw the money Christina Crawford made off of Mommie Dearest and this is her poor atempt to replicate that novel. The book is boring, transparent and not worth the paper upon which it is written."
1,Ungrateful overgrown brat makes money hurting celebrity mom!,"When I first read My Mother's Keeper, I was about 14 years old. Being young and naive, I almost believed Hyman's tale of woe about her famous mother. Thank God for being alive 15 years later. I have read the book about more than five times since then, strictly for comic relief.So Bette Davis endured an abusive marriage while B.D. was a little girl, wasn't the Betty Crocker mom, drank too much, and was occasionally obnoxious at the dinner table. So Bette Davis had faults (gasp!). Wow!...After all her mother did for her and gave her long after she was married, and this is how she repaid her. From the other Davis biographies I've read, B.D. needed her mother to shower her with gifts because her son-in-law was a lazy bum!Bette Davis is still one of greatest American actresses for all time, and that is how I will remember her in spite of her faults. When B.D. passes away, she'll be blessed if anyone even cares."
2,B.D. Hyman--Sold Her Mother Out for $$$$$$$$$,"Well well well...B.D. Hyman--say Amen, folks! The woman who seems never to have had a real job in her life, along with her leech-like husband Jeremy--tears her mother apart with this sensation-seeking piece of muck raking.Bette Davis was not an easy woman to deal with--I think anyone with a brain in their head could figure this out. Highly strung, neurotic, and probably an alcoholic, she was demanding to the point of torture. B.D. and Jeremy, however, b***ch and moan about what a witch she is, but still had their hands out ready to take any cash she offered. If you would like a good laugh, read Narrow Is the Way, B.D.'s follow-up book detailing how they ran away to the Bahamas when creditors started chasing them in the U.S.. B.D. now runs an evangelical ministry--snigger snigger--you can give her money--cash, credit card or check--and she'll pray for you."
2,Mommie.......Dearest?,"First things first if you are lucky enought o get a hold of the orignal copy of this book and Mommie Dearest place them side by side. They are made by the same company, in the same shade of wine red, and the covers are identical, too bad the inside isn't. B.D. Hyman recounts the tales of horror that she endured with her mean mother, Bette. The terror of having a mother who curses, who doesn't make fresh casseroles, and who isn't delirously excited when her underage daughter wants to marry someone she barely knew, gosh B.D. how ever did you survive. This is clearly an attempt to jump on the celebrity mother bandwagon and sadly B.D. missed the bandwagon and thudded to the ground. Bette evn forgave her in the biography of This N That, if I had been her I would've cut her out the will and showed how bad life really could be"
2,Good concept-sloppy execution,"I recently ordered this book - what a disappointment! This book profiles luxury beach hotels around the world and includes leading hotels in locales such as the Seychelles, Maldives, Oman, Bora Bora and numerous other places. There are two problems however. First, the quality of the pictures is inconsistent - some pictures are good but there are too many that are blurry. Also, many of the pictures are from the hotels themselves. The problem with this is that the pictures can be found on the websites of these hotels already and can be viewed for free. Second, the descriptions of the hotels are poorly written and provide next to no information. I could go on but why bother - Skip this one!"
3,"A decent retelling of ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea""","Ben Cross and Richard Crenna are both fine actors. I am never afraid to check out a movie when either one is involved.Unfortunately, they are not given the proper support from the writer or the director. This movie covers the basics from the book and Crenna and Cross put in fine performances. However, the story is spotty at best and the monsters are borderline ridiculous. Julie Cox (good lord, those eyes!) puts in a decent but largely two-dimensional performance as Aronnox' daughter, an added character that provided romantic tension between Ned Land and Nemo.Not a bad movie, but I'd rather you check out the Michael Caine version produced at around the same time."
2,This movie sinks taking Ben Cross and the Nautalis with it!,Wow! Did this movie stink!!! The writers for this movie should be shot it's so bad! It took real talent to write a screen play so bad that even the fine actor Ben Cross not only couldn't save it but it manages to make him look bad. This movie was schmaltzy and silly and is an insult to Jules Verne's great classic. Don't waste the money to buy this or any of your precious time to watch it. If you do you'll regret it. You'll have more fun spending the night filing your nails.
1,Repulsively awful garbage,"This (made for TV?) movie is so horribly bad it rivals the garbage cranked out by the Sci Fi channel. Perhaps it was one of their efforts? Everything about this movie is just bad... lackluster special effects, creaky convoluted story, half-hearted acting, etc. First of all, aside from the title of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Captain Nemo and the Nautilus, the film bears little resemblance to the Jules Verne novel. I understand that movies based on books are always an adaptation, but this one is a real stretch. It would almost be better if they changed the name so you wouldn't expect to see Verne's story. The cast is one of those where they use some B and C list actors with some name value but who are past their prime as far as being able to salvage this sinking wreck of a movie. Even the 1916 silent 20,000 Leagues is better than this. The Michael Caine version is also equally as bad."
1,"Should sink 20,000 Leagues its so bad","This movie is apallingly bad. I found that it has only a casual resemblance to the Jules Verne novel. Aside from the Nautilus and Nemo, the rest of the story is made up from scratch, and is not very imaginative. The special effects are lackluster, and obviously cheap CGI work (a la Sci Fi Channel productions). The story only vaguely resembles the Verne plot, with romance playing a large part of the new interpretation. The dark soul of Verne's Nemo is lost, as is Nemo's twisted notion of waging war against the nations of the world, to end war and human suffering. Its on TV enough, along with another similar remake, to avoid buying this sinker."
5,Best Toy I've played with,"This doll is the best doll in the world!I always brush their hair and bring them into the bathtub with me. My friend LOVES the charm bracelets.We play with them all of the time.I gave her Sana and Kept Calista.BUY THE DOLLS FOR ANY GIRL WHO HAS A BEST,BEST,BEST BUD!~4 Ever Best Friends~"
5,Clever use of dialect and language--more than a Romance Nove,"This wonderful book will appeal to anyone that has ever hoped to be reunited with a lost love. Evan Ames has written a sensitive and frank story that will enchant romance novel enthusiasts. But the real surprise is the depth of intelligence he has given to Ian, who struggles to understand the spontaneous, creative and reckless behaviors of his soulmate, Karen. Her defiant and often self-destructive actions will amuse the reader, and the conclusion will definitely satisfy."
2,OK Not great,"This novel is just too long. The story is too predictable and the ending trite. However, the author shows some writing ability. The CD that is included in the package features a sappy and forgettable love song, but the idea of including the CD is a good one!"
5,uboat reference,since there is no review for this great book.. here goes.this is only about uboats and deals with all uboat typestechnically and their support structure and personel.it does not deal much with individual boats but some time is spent on history and operations.It is an excellent reference on uboat bases and bunkers.the uboat crew and ranks are covered and weapons and tactics are detailed.There are many photos and some illustrations that I would like to get prints of.the pc uboat game silent hunter 3 is as good as its top ratingsindicate and it ties in well to this book.the book is a great value for the serious military reader.
3,Shows signs of potential,"This record is clearly a starting point, however there are a few stand out moments where everything clicks and you forget that this is the bands first effort. The production is reminiscent of early 90s alternative rock, suiting most of the songwriting, and one can't help but note the impact reknowned engineer John Towner had on this record. At times, a more progressive edge can be found, as heard on Logo 7's drive and groove flow, and lead guitarist Ryan Dolan shows his chops throughout the record. The vocals and ragged at best, yet the masterful efforts of the rhythm guitarist really seem to mask the ill-croonings of young Scott Sweeney. Given time, I expect great things from this band. 3 out of 5 stars."
3,Product was ok but seller not ready for ecommerce,"After a like five weeks and two shipments, I still received the wrong battery. Not that I didn't check the actual model numbers and spec on the listing versus that on my battery. I would order one model number battery, yet received another. So this specific model battery, maybe ok, I don't know I never received it. The oversized, wrong spec, wrong model battery I did end up getting to keep because the seller said just keep it after refund seems to be of great quality. But it is of no use to me as I don't have anything that could use it."
3,Middle-of-the-road UK love triangle,"Superb acting is squandered in a lackluster and uninspiring hybred of comedy, romance, and thriller that tries too hard on all fronts and falls flat."
2,A disappointment,"While the story has merit, the endless scenes of stupidity were tiresome. Who wants to watch morons constantly fighting, smashing things and people, living in filthy homes? Acting was good, but the show was a big disappointment."
2,Where's the foam?,"I saw the other review and saw that it wasn't the foam and I had hoped maybe they had got a bad bottle. Nope. This stuff doesn't come out as that awesome foam but more of a cream and leaves my hands looking really greasy shiny looking. As for my hair I have naturally oily hair to begin with and up by the roots this stuff made my hair look greasy shiny but the ends of my hair looks lovely. I will only use this particular bottle if I wear a ponytail and need to smooth fly aways or if my hair is down only use it at the ends. When I saw the price I thought it was too good to be true and for me it was. I will not be repurchasing, I guess I will just have to bite the bullet and pay the same price for less. But at least I know it will work."
3,Not salon quality,"I bought this product from my hair dresser and LOVED it! I thought I'd get it cheaper online, but this one comes out like cooking oil instead of fluffy white foam."
4,I am using this item for over years!,"My hairdresser recomended to use this product ages ago.This is bigger than normal size,so it was a good deal."
4,Smells Wonderful,"I had to pick this up and smell it because the packaging definitely stands out! I put a little on my finger tip and rubbed it on my hand and waited a bit. I was surprised how great it smelled and decided to put back another product and buy this instead. I recently bought Bead Head's Deep Wave curler, so I straightened my hair, then put in some after party and curled my hair. It looks cute today, I have gotten complements. I also used it after straightening my hair as I have highlights right now and get little fly away hairs. It puts a little shine on as well. For more intense shine, I would recommend a shine product but this is good if you want a little with some control. It's a little thicker than I expected, but a tiny bit goes a long way, so it's a good thing. Honestly, I wish I had lotion with the scent of this product!"
5,Can't live without it,"I have very unruly and fuzzy, natural curly hair! Bed Head After Party tames the frizz and makes nice soft curls........plus it smells wonderful!!"
5,Great size ..love it,"love this size, i have had smaller ones but this is great.fast service also. i will always buy this way."
5,In His Grip,In His Grip came in a very timely manner and it was in like new condition. This will be a great benefit to our golf ministry. I am also going to do a Bible study using this kit and the study guides that I purchased seperately. I would highly recommend this seller.
1,Great Customer Service - not rhetorical!,"There was a problem with the actual unit I received. However when I contacted the seller, they immediately set to work in helping me! I believe I only paid shipping charges to get this little card to me, but that made no difference to this company - they treated me like I was the most important customer they had. It is customer service like this that makes me a repeat customer! So boo on the card not working like I needed, but Way to Go to the team at AGFA who are doing all they can to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase. I hope the 1 star only affects the product and not the store. These people are great!"
1,green music,"This is a glimspe of two co-existing realms where only one knows of the others existence. There are wisdoms here of earth, the sea, Jack Daniels and of evolution itself. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be a turtle then this is your book. ""...just like his own house, it's empty airiness a ballroom for the sea winds to tango in...."" With a thorough command of language this is a liquid green ride that will stay close to the waterlogged heart long after you put it down and will get your little turtle heart beating in the most humorous of ways. I didn't want this one to end. When you do put it down it will probably only be long enough to come up for air. Beware of sprouting fins."
3,"Useful, economical, frustrating","I find the ""little Kittel"" easy on the budget and shelf space. However, as one who has had Greek in seminary, I find the use of transliterations for all the Greek words to be a pain. I'd rather look up Greek in Greek than trying to figure out which English word equivalent is used or how they transliterate things.The lack of any Strong's numbers or actual greek-text index detracts from this otherwise valuable resource. Besides that, it is a gold mine of exegetical insight."
5,A great book,because it is outstanding and I loved every thing about this book i would recommend this product to all age group's and ones with a fear of englishi can not put it down.
5,for kids and parents together,I work in a teacher education program. This book is perfect because it's charming and whimsical yet doesn't talk down to its audience. Rubin's dry wit complements her expressive illustrations--parents and teachers will find laugh-out-loud moments for themselves. Does anyone know of other books by Vicky Rubin?
5,ralphie's a lovable devil,"This book is just delightful. My grandson adores Ralphie, who's also a lovable devil. When Ralphie comes home with a mud-wrestling trophy (he's a dino), he find his parents all mushy about something else. An egg! Their egg! Ralphie's antics are hilarious as he tries to get rid of the sibling-to-be but just in time, he changes his mind. The illustrations are great, too, with lots of sly jokes that you may miss the first time. We love Ralphie!"
4,In the style of old Metallica,This record is full of Metallica style riffs and the musicianship is rock solid. The songs are shorter than there fist 2 records but just as good.
5,Classic that fell under the radar,"Meliah Rage fans rejoice! This album has just been remastered and re-released, coming right on the heels of the announcement that Mike Munro (original vocalist) has re-joined the band. Anyone who got into these guys with ""Kill To Survive"" and ""Solitary Solitude"" may have missed this gem when it was released the first time around. It didn't get much push at the time, but was (and still is) a truly outstanding offering. This album is classic, uncompromising thrash, following and expanding in the footsteps of their previous releases. Thankfully, it's getting another chance to be heard, and anybody checking these guys out for the first time with this CD can discover their back catalogue as well. Looking forward to the early '09 release of their new record with Mike Munro back in the fold!"
5,fixed the problem,"Wow, who thought Amazon had parts for my air nailer? Exactly what I needed, quick ship and was back in business in no time at all."
3,Trigger kit,"The trigger kit arrived very timely, and was pretty easy to install. All it takes is someone with only minor skills to put in. The only problem I had was it didn't fix my coil roofing nailer. It started leaking air, badly, and I was told the trigger kit fixes 75 percent of the problems. Well, I have the other 25 percent. Overall the product is fine, just not what I needed."
5,Great wheels,"Dico 527-36-6 Cushion Sewn 6-Inch Diameter 1/2-Inch Thick Buffing WheelI have used dico buffing wheels for years. They are much better quality than the many cheaper imported wheels commonly found these days. I used to have a local tool store that ordered them in bulk, this meant I could get them with specific hole sizes rather than the arbor adaptor, but they no longer carry these. However, I have found that the arbor adaptor works well, and the wheels are always ""true"", ready to go, and long lasting. I have used this and various other dico wheels on projects from vintage baby high chairs to motorcycles, and always got great results. I highly recommend these wheels."
1,Worst Experience Ever,"I've owned so many Sony products, this one is a dud. Someone already mentioned the horrible placement of the power in, the little rubber flipper gets in the way of everything. The PicturePackage software is a complete joke. SonyCopy.exe crashes every time I try to open my pictures. The lens cover is not automatic, and needs to be open no matter what you want to do. If its not open, it screams 'cover not open' at you until you MANUALLY open it. The device shows up as Camcorder 2 in Windows XP, you cannot browse your memory stick thru windows explorer. The resolution of the still shots is HORRIBLE. Do not buy this camera. Ugh. I'm stuck with it because I bought it at a retailer that won't take it back after 14 days."
4,"Good camcorder,","I ordered this camcorder and have it for a week now. Basicly,it is a good camcorder. It is very small, but give a good quarlity. The movie recorded by the memory stick is bad. In the manual it is said to be able to record from tv or vcr, I followed the instruction, but failed to do that. Still cofusing."
4,Good Product,"Pro: Solid rings very rigid, nice key/keyway for alignment to bases.Con: Side mount screws make it hard for setup and alignment."
5,Fascinating picture of village life in rural China,"I was Suoqun's friend at Penn in the early 80's. I had no idea then of his humble backround. He was so smart, so kind and gentle. He never revealed his background to me. I wish he had, but now, reading this fascinating autobiography of his, written in his own, simple, straightforward voice, it's almost as if I had him here telling me the story of his life himself. Readers who want a true portrayal of village life from rural Northwest China in the 60's and 70's will find this book fascinating."
3,Eh,"The game play was nice. It starts out in a fun way. It does get repetitive though, and easily boring.The main reason why I wanted to play this game was for the multi player. Unfortunately you have to unlock it. I've completed 60% of the game and used the unlock codes for the multi player and it still wont let me play. I'm disappointed that this yet another game where you have to unlock multi player. Can we please get some games out there that you don't have to end the game three thousand times before you can play with your friends?"
2,Not for an inexperienced gamer.....,"My husband and I recently bought a Wii. I haven't honestly had a game system since my Colecovision back in the 1980's, so this was all new to us! While I have loved some of the games -- especially the Carnival game -- this one is a little more challenging and it takes forever to master the different challenges. As far as we can tell, you have to master the challenges or else you go back to where you were in the story to do it over and over again. Not too fun.The graphics are really great though and the story is cute. I'm sure this is a great game for some people, but it just wasn't for us. We'll stick to the Carnival game and the racing ones for him. We just picked up the Bully game, too, and that one seems a little challenging but not nearly as hard to navigate with the controls."
3,Ratatouille Wii game.,I bought this for my 7 & 4 year old but my 4 year old can't play it yet..it's kinda hard for me so my 7 year old needs help sometimes.
5,Overall Fun,"The game plays through a story line, so you don't get lost on what to do next, so pretty simple. Has a couple of things you have to figure out which to do first but that's the extent of the adventure. The timed sequencing of jumps/controling Remy was challenging for both adults who tried it....Way to difficult for younger children.our 6 year old enjoys watching mommy play - (good graphic quality), would expect a teenager to be bored with it if they are an active gamer.Note: easy mode, on a scale of 1-10 was about an 8 in difficulty. ---> Didn't dare try the normal or hard modes.This Adult Disney fan enjoyed playing it through (after many do-overs) and look forward to conquering the multi-player mini games next."
4,Very Entertaining!,"This is a lot of fun, yet very challenging. It takes a really long time to complete all the stages of this game. We have had it for several months and still have not finished all the stages. The mini games and challenges are the most fun, but you have to play through the stages to unlock most of these. Our family definitely got our money's worth."
4,Ratatouille for Wii,This game is fun and some parts are very easy and some parts are kind of hard. I think it will be a great challenge for my child to play it.
3,"like the book, yet not","This was a rare movie that was exactly like the book, story wise. But for some reason, the movie misses the suspense and thrills of the book despite the good actors (and Sharon Stone, heh, heh)."
3,Makes you think afterwards about this,The movie afterwards let's you think that every god should have a tool like this.You can't really classify this movie but it is scifi and will make you think what really happend.Didn't it??
1,One to avoid!,"I like science fiction. Good science fiction. That means, amongst other things, that the initial premise, however hard to believe, is pursued to its logical endpoint. This film, however, starts with an interesting scenario, runs the gamut of B-movie horror cliches to a totally predictable revelation, and winds things up with one of the worst excuses for a contrived cop-out ending that I have ever seen. Most inexcusable of all, none of the interesting questions raised at the beginning of the film is explored at all. A major-league stinker, justifying plastic surgery and federal witness protection for all involved."
2,Worse than the sum of its parts,"When I heard that they were going to make a movie based on the Crichton's novel Sphere, I wondered why they bothered. When I read the novel back in the early 80s, I thought the novel was a mess. There were stock horror scenes mixed with some interesting mysteries, and an extremely clumsy ending. The movie could not break that mold, despite some inventive scenes. At the end of movie, I had the ""why bother"" feeling so similar to that I had close to 20 years ago. The production value is very good though."
3,Sphere,"I have not read the book, so I am only reviewing the film itself. I had no real intrest when I first saw the theatre trailers. Now, when HBO began to advertise its showing, I became a bit more intriqued. I noticed that Liev Schriber, brilliant actor, was in the movie and he appeals to me. Dustin Hoffman was great as always. Not a Sharon Stone of Sam L. Jackson fan, but they were believable in there roles. The movie had a great plot. I enjoyed everything, up until the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending wasn't terrible, just was missing that special something. Overall, I would recommend it to any Sci-Fi buff out there."
3,great movie till the ending came up,"i thought this movie was so great until the ending and then it's like all the great suspense and story add up to completely nothing. it was kind of dissapointing. don't buy it, rent it first."
3,"Enjoyable, but a bizzarre ending","This movie had many reviews but overall I thought it was very enjoyable. I purchased it on DVD which gives you the ability to listen to Dustin Hoffman and the Director speak about each scene and since that time I have watched it 3-4 times more. The special effects are spectacular and the plot is unique. The movie has to be viewed more than once to get its full effect and make you think about all the lines that the actors said and what they meant, by the time you reach the end of the movie. The second viewing was more enjoyable than the first."
1,Another case of Book MUCH BETTER than movie,I can understand why this movie retails at 15.00. Save yourself and read the book or better yet listen to the audio book. Movie is difficult to follow and leaves out many important details to the story.
2,A shameful Crichton adaptation...,"The first half of ""Sphere"" is top notch. The second half is weak, bland, and unexciting. The film stays true to the book, but abandons all the qualities that made is such a page-turner. Gone are the ever reaching tentacles of the squid monster; they've been replaced by a sonar blip in the shape of a squid. This is incredibly not scary. Also, the dialogue consists of our characters blandly saying things that progressively make little sense, to the point where the end is just a bunch of jumbled words. ""Sphere"" is a film that makes you feel mad at everyone involved for turning in such a weak film. It starts out so promising, then gives us very little. What a darn shame."
2,well made bad movie,This is your typical formulaic sci-fi movie from the mid to late nineties. The cast is great and the move is well made and some scenes do keep you on edge. But on the whole the plot seemed quite pointless. It's okay for a casual watch but pretty meh movie overall.
3,Cheap Suspense,"Most of the suspense really centers around the characters being unable or refusing, to communicate with each other, or to work as a team. Some of that is explained by personality friction, but most of the time there's no good reason and it only serves to create meaningless suspense."
2,Great premise... ruined,"Secret government project... leads strange technology... leads to mind control over reality??!?... and that's where things fall apart. The book actually explains what is going on. The movie tries to scare you into thinking you understand what's going on. It gets so bad that at the very end of this 'action flick' they have to spend 5 minutes of seemingly ad-lib'd dialog just to arrive at the same plot point as the book. Fail.Just in case you were wondering, the book was written by Michael Crichton. That's the same author who penned Jurassic Park, and look how that movie turned out! $$$ must have decided this movie."
3,Closed time like loops and Aliens,"With three great actors in it, you would think a movie couldn't bomb?!I suppose it has to do with the novel not being worth much to start?When the final bomb goes off, we are gratefulinstead of sorry? Science fiction as a B horror movieis just not a very good idea.And when it is on a high budget everybody regrets it?Some of Micheal Crichton's other novels as movies turned much better."
3,It was OK,"This movie was ok.I read the book because I am a very big Michael Crichton Fan, but I got to say the movie stinked,If they had more action it would be better. The only thing good about this movie was Samuel L. Jackson. So if u want to see it I warn u it is not all good"
3,Pretty good,"Pretty good movie for a slow night when you want to watch something on tv and nothing is on. Kind of cool to see Samuel L. Jackson, Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman in this sci-fi flick."
2,A great Crichton novel poorly translated to a movie,"The novel was mysterious, intriguing, and addictive. Others have detailed the storyline so I won't repeat, but it was an out-of-the-norm plot. I really looked forward to seeing if my mental picture of the sphere and all that happened would resemble what the movie showed. What a disappointment. It wasn't even close. Had the movie followed the story in the book I would have concluded that my image needed an update. But the movie was just blah. It lacked the ability to capture you in the story. If you haven't read the book, the movie probably is more appealing because you don't know what has been left out. Chalk it up to another failed Hollywood attempt to turn a great story into a lackluster movie."
5,Loved the book and the movie,"I think it can be pointless to compare the movie to the book, in all cases, because they're two different pieces of work. The movie is ""based' off the book almost always; it isn't an exact representation, and how could it be? Reading a book is an entirely different experience than watching a movie. The book is amazing. So is the movie, in my opinion. I thought the cast and the acting was stellar, and I was always enthralled and caught in suspense. I think the ending is beautiful, not anticlimactic. Why does the ending of a science fiction thriller always have to be a huge climax? This is a unique ending that wraps everything up in a very simple way. This will always be one of my favorite movies."
2,"Big Budget, Bigger Stars, Biggest Disappointment","OK, pretend that you want to make a movie just like ""Event Horizon"" except it takes place underwater. Oh wait, they did. It's called ""Sphere"". This is a very uninspired, unoriginal movie with lukewarm performances all around. Big name cast, big money production, big disappoint. Totally unnecessary film - you don't need to see this one.I suggest renting ""Event Horizon"" first. Pay attention to the dream manifestation sequences. Now watch ""Sphere"". Aren't these the same ideas just done in a new setting? Worth a rent maybe, but don't buy this."
2,Sphere mostly disappoints,"There are a couple of reasons to watch Sphere and the main one is simply because of Samuel L. Jackson, starring in his first of two underwater films. (I guess he still hasn't learned) Anyway, he delivers a great performance, and unlike in Deep Blue Sea, doesn't get cut off (literally) in a middle of a speech and torn in half. Another reason to watch Sphere is for some good special effects. They are there, but there is no story to back it up. Actually, there is a story that has a good mystery element to it but unfortunately NOTHING is explained. And if you thought matters weren't resolved in Event Horizon, wait till you watch Sphere."
2,jackson is great,"the only reason i rented this movie was 1.the cool trailer!! then i learned that they ony show the good parts. 2.samuel l. jackson he was good and so was the movie, except the end. i mean come on they are gonna agree to forget! thats pretty cheesy."
5,If you haven't seen it....SEE IT!!!,The movie Sphere was a mind boggoling movie that made me jump over 5 feet on several occasions.
3,Great Sci-fi thriller,"I thought it was sort of kreepy at some points. The whole ""going into the sphere"" thing was really ery I thought. The part where the girl gets practicly eaten by the jellyfish. That part was pure genius. I was sort of confused to where the sphere actually came from. I knew that it came from somewhere in space and that the earth wasn't really ready for it. I mean think about it, it cane make your dreams come true and earthling are panicky people who wouldn't know how to use it. I just wanted to know why the alians or whatever sent it."
1,What happened?,"I really wanted to like this movie. I honestly did. I love sci-fi, horror and mystery movies. The actors cast are an impressive group. Michael Crichton is a terrific writer. But I have to say that this is HANDS DOWN, the WORST movie I've seen in 10 years. It made no sense (and folks, I loved Event Horizon). How long was this movie? It felt like it was about 6 hours. Obviously a lot of money was spent to make this movie...how did it go so wrong, so boring, so stupid? It was so painful that I was even hating Jules Verne at the end for writing ""20,000 Leagues"". Please don't waste your money on this."
3,"""It's not impossible, it's ridiculous.""","Loved the book.Didn't love this movie.Didn't hate it either.But I won't watch it again.Obligatory wisecracks, soaring (overpowering) score, odd casting, and a weird ending, all combine to distract from an interesting premise. If wishes were horses.....Instead, they should have wished for a better script."
3,Sphere,"What the Amazon professional review is saying is eminently correct -- the film is derivative. Like ""Event Horizon"" that came out almost at the same time, the movie borrows its basic premise from the Russian ""Solaris,"" where a moral tale is told through supernatural phenomena enabled by the presence of a spaceship. The twist here is that the spaceship is 300 years old and lies on the bottom of the ocean.Perhaps the ocean is a metaphor that represents our layered thinking and the ""sphere"" on the bottom of it is our deepest desires and the realization that we CAN make them real. The cast is indeed very talented and, along with special effects and a pricey set design, it rescues this movie from a total catastrophe. Our deepest emotions, our fantasies, our true nature are made of fear, suspicion, and violence. It's best to leave them repressed -- at the bottom of the ocean -- if we want to continue to live."
2,Great cast bogged down in sub &#65533;B&#65533; material.,"How can a movie with this cast, and directed by Barry Levinson, be so bad? I've never really listen to profession critics, so I rented this expecting a pretty good film. Boy, was I ever wrong. This film miss-fires on every level. I thought I was watching a 50s `B' film, and basically, I was. I won't go into the plot (there isn't any, at least any worth mentioning), but this film did have one thing I enjoyed, at that was seeing Peter Coyote. I was wondering what had happened to him. It's too bad his return had to be in this turkey. Between 1 and 10, ""Sphere"" gets a 4, and is lucky to get that."
2,Gold?,"Crichton is a masterful story writer, and has rubbed a dab of his style off on me. The movie sphere is not completely terrible, but not amazing. I guess that Hollywood believes if you throw in enough cursing it will make any movie good. But I think, as some of the other viewers do, that they should have stuck more to the book. It is a terrific story that I have read enjoyably several times. But the makers should have spent more time on the film! If the basic plot would have been as inspiring as the book, I wouldn't have minded to sit two more hours for it. It had the basis to become a terrific blockbuster equal to Jurassic Park. But unfortunately it doesn't come close to what I anticipated. The movie is ok for the, ""Blow em up, blood and dribble"" lovers. But if you want complete satisfaction, READ THE BOOK!"
3,SPHERE is a psychological thriller not a Sci-Fi film.,"An interesting concept that held my attention well throughout. But, if you thought Dustin Hoffman was out of place in OUTBREAK, you'll have a hard time with SPHERE as well. Forget about the fact that Samuel L Jackson, Sharon Stone and Hoffman were wasted on this film. None seemed to know how to deal with their respective characters. I suspect much of the total film remains on the cutting room floor. All of that now said, let the exploration of the concept be your reason to see this film. The gradual realization of nature of the film's antagonist makes the process worthwhile. This film could have been very good with a LESS notable cast and an ending that doesn't seem like a cop-out."
1,Laughable badness,"Star studded clunker with oodles of promise at the beginning only to turn into trite trash at the end. Why would anyone make a movie this bad? Furthermore,why would Barry Levinson make a movie this bad? I suppose I will be on my way to unlocking at least one of the secrets of Hollywood when I figure that out. This is so awful it probably killed reprint sales of the book for a time.Just terrible. Made no sense whatsoever, and will insult whatever intelligence you have with its thoughtless, cynical moral, which is somewhere along the lines of ""if we could bring to existence whatever we dream, it'd all be ugly and horrible because that's what people are made of."" Real deep, huh?"
1,Don't rent or watch me,"I did not like this movie and that has nothing to do with the fact that i read the book.This movie is a failure because the director failed to capture the notion of hysteria. What you get is small amounts of confusions.The story is about the unknown, and confusion would mean that people are not sure about certain things. Following what the SPHERE is supposed to do and be, everything is possible and anything can happen. There should be hysteria.The movies makes attempts at greatness, but falls short because of minor issues. For example, toward the end, three survivors are being held for debriefing, and you see the sub-title Day One on the screen. For affect, shouldn't it say Day three. Then the viewer would think, wow, three days, in a room, with nothing to do, wow. Instead, we see, day one, and then the movie is over."
3,I Liked It !!,"I love movies that I have to figure out and so on that point I'm really feeling this movie. Not only was the movie itself good, but it was also scary at times, and there was plenty of suspense. We get a lot of ""what"" but very few ""whys"" so it keeps you kind of glued. Like everyone else I don't like the ending. They could have gone in so many other directions with the ending but they went with the strangest one. The remaining charachters decided to just ""forget"" everything that happened....ummm...??? Ok. This movie was a lot like the Event Horizon. I loved the Event Horizon also. I'd encourage anyone to see."
3,Sphere,"Barry Levinson's sci fi thriller is a taut, suspensful film which underservedly got bad reviews when it was released. Sure, it has it's flaws, but the story (taken from Micheal Chricton's novel) is thought-provoking and provides for some seriously spooky moments, and like THE ABYSS, the claustraphobic feel racks up the tension. The star power of Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson give the film gravitas, and Sharon Stone has one of her best roles here. CGI creations and downright freaky sea creatures are great. For the most part, the story consists of a series of extraordinary events, that, while fascinating, create an anti-climax at the end, which is somewhat dissapointing. It does have it's moments of suspense, if only the ending had worked to a fuller effect, then this would be a great film, instead of just a good one."
2,"Great effects, bad movie","After watching this, I was scratching my head as to why they would blow so much money on the amazing special effects, with such a lame script. I think the actors did OK with what they had to work with, but sometimes the stuff they said or did just didn't make any sense! The movie starts off promisingly, with an interesting premise (scientists discover a mysterious futuristic craft on the bottom of the ocean, and slowly unravel where it came from), but pretty soon loses it and becomes annoying. Worth renting only if you're into seeing the cool underwater visuals.A better underwater movie (but older so with less advanced effects): The Abyss."
2,Sphere - READ THE BOOK!,"Sphere the movie vs. Sphere the book. The book deals a lot with the emotions of each character: Their thoughts, their emotions, and how they deal with their environment. That's what makes the movie so confusing. You DO NOT know what's going on in the characters heads. My two cents worth: Read the book first, then when you watch the movie, you'll understand what's going on and it will make more sense and be more enjoyable (although the book is still so much better!)"
1,Sheer disapointment,"Why don't screenwriters learn how to read? This movie misfires each time it steers away from Crichton's novel, which provided yet a ready-made script. The filming is poor (we never get a clear sense of the underwater station's topography), the acting is clearly below average (the whole cast appears to be as bored as the audience turns out to be), and most of all the whole production looks cheap (the jellyfish is OK, but where the heck is the giant squid? In this age of sophisticated CGI, you can't suggest there's a huge monster around and never show it once. Did they run short on dough or something?). Forget the flick and read the book instead."
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie is just plain old bad -- no logical plot, and derivative and stupid subplots (Samuel L. Jackson going whacko is a straight ripoff from another movie) designed to distract you from realizing there IS NO plot, etc. The only fun thing was the airplane cockpit, but it was gone in 60 seconds.... There are some fun ""C"" movies -- this isn't one of them!"
2,"Great Book, Bad movie","If you like the book like I did, you will HATE this movie. What a terrible adaptation!"
1,Boring. No suspense. The plot is ridiculous.,This movie is boring. There's no suspense or action. The plot is ridiculous. The special effects are not insteresting.Save your money on this one.
1,Apparition Sisterhood and the Fate of the Sparrows in Mungbread,"Sharon Stone. Kiss of death. Sloppy kiss of death. Sloppy, halitosis-infested kiss of death. I defy anyone to name a quality movie in which she was involved. Anyone who rates this movie favorably probably loved ""Thumbsucker"", ""The Virgin Suicides"", and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"". HORRID."
4,"""Good & Interesting Sci-Fi Flick!""","Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone and Samuel L. Jackson starin Barry Levinson's 1998 sci-fi film based on the book.A team of scientists find an ancient spacecraft andencounter an alien entity in the form of a giant ball.This is a good & interesting sci-fi flick. This dvd hasnice picture and sound plus commentary, the trailer,tv spots & visual effects featurette. I recommendthis."
4,Very Entertaining!,"This is a good movie, with a very good cast. I have seen this movie many times and I still enjoy it.It raises the question, ""What would humanity do with the ultimate power?""The power to make all their dreams come true!!! I think that's obvious!!Watch the movie, and see what you think!!"
3,It could've been a lot better,"I don't know. I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it. The acting was decent, but not top-rate (Hoffman seemed miscast, but Schreiber had it down almost perfectly). The special effects looked realistic and charming to look at. The music had that proper ""deep sea"" feel; I enjoyed listening to it while watching the movie. But the biggest problem I had with the film was the plot and how it was all mixed toward the end. I couldn't make sense with the plot twists, and the ending left me a bit puzzled. Maybe I should've read the book first. But it was a decent, but not fantastic, movie nonetheless."
4,"A great movie, supported by a great cast!","Sphere is wonderful movie. It has a great cast including Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Sharon Stone. Also features good performances by Liev Schrieber and Peter Coyote. Sphere tells the story of a spacecraft which was found crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Yet its discovered that it crashed there 300 years ago. A team is sent down below the depths of the ocean to investigate. I wish I knew why people bash this movie so badly. Sure the book may have been better, but the movie is still really good and for some reason I still watch over and over. The acting, story, and special effects are superb. Fans of Hoffman must see this. The dvd is pretty good, it features and interesting commentary by Jackson and Hoffman. Rated PG-13 for violence and profanity."
2,The Abyss' ugly cousin...,"...and this sci-fi-thriller is wrecked by a bad script, unsympathetic characters (or pathetic acting -you choose!), unforgivable performances by a talented cast such as Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone (who hasn't played in a good movie for a while) and Samuel L. Jackson. None of them can save ""Sphere"". It is one of those movies that promises a lot, and when the movie is over you feel cheated. First time I saw ""The Abyss"" I actuallt felt a bit more ""hungry"", but nowhere near this. Uninspiring and boring and chaotic and confusing and stupid! Easy money, no doubt! It's not even at the same level as ""Event Horizon"" -and this should really draw you the picture."
2,What a waste for 3 big stars,"I like sci-fi flicks a lot but this one really blew me away. You got 3 big stars, trying really hard to make it work. But it just didn't do it. The effects are great, but the story is very poor. This is one of those that feels just like an episode of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea""."
3,take me to your therapist,this is a movie i enjoyed but it could have been alot better. the cast overall is excellent and very enjoyable to watch. samual jackson is very cool. the special effects when they happen are very interesting but there are not that many of them. there are some interesting ideas hidden throughout which can make us think about what is happening. the cons are that there were not enough special effects to do the movie justice. the movie does at time bog down with past relationships and interactions that don't really effect the plot. the ending is a little confusing as well. the pro's good solid acting some interesting ideas are a interesting overall feel to the film. the dvd comes with 2 commentaries and are an interesting listen as well as a short featurette on the making of the film. give it a watch but don't expect to much.
4,Interersting movie,It's very unusual and thought provoking as far as the concepts about the sphere and the effects that the sphere has on people go.
2,Do I really Care about these characters?,"This movie was impressively bland. What started out as an interesting premise - an alien spacecraft trapped on the ocean floor, becomes rapidly tedious. If there is no action in the movie, then there needs to be character development so that I will care when the characters start getting knocked off. No luck here.I hoped that the movie commentary from Hoffman and Jackson would at least be enlightening, but it was of little value as well.You would be better off renting ""Forbidden Planet"" - same premise, better movie. Plus it had Ann Francis in a much better costume than Sharon Stone, and RObbie the Robot getting drunk."
2,Does not reflect Reformed thinking,"I don't have the book in front of me anymore, so I can't pull quotes from it, but I remember thinking as I read this book that the author didn't really understand what the Reformation was about. At one point, he says in effect ""God's love responds to man's faith"". The Reformers clearly taught that man's faith responds to God's love and His calling. I know that the book wasn't about in depth theology, but statments like the above made it hard to take the rest of the book seriously."
2,Tell me the details!!!!!,"I would buy much more off the internet if I knew what I was buying.....Why do very few sellers share the specific information about the product!!! Tell me if it is 4 inches wide or 3 inches, data that I cannot tell from a picture......I am not returning products that do not match to what they appear or what I have been forced to guess at......I will go to the local store where I can find these answers myself"
5,Fancy Men's Ties,Beautiful is all I can say! I love this tie and it came packaged well. I would highly recommend any purchase from this company.
5,Great product!,"Had several watches needing batteries and had trouble removing the covers on a couple so I gambled on this tool. Was skeptical that it would work as advertised but found it to work exactly as advertised. It took only a couple of tries and the back popped right off. Much easier than using a screwdriver and bending the tip, or using a razor blade and breaking it, or trying to find another tool that works."
1,Didn't work,Didn't work for either a Timex watch or a Kenneth Cole watch. These at on very tight -- also tried (and failed) to open with an oyster knife.
1,Not worth it,"It wouldn't open difficult-to-open snap-back cases in my watch collection. For the few cases it would open my trusty snap-back case knife worked better. I also noticed in one case it left a nice gouge in the case, unlike the knife. I returned mine, it was a lousy tool."
5,Here's how it works,"I bought this thinking it was just a pry bar thanks to Amazon's famous non-descript descriptions of what they sell. (I'd like to give Amazon a ""zero star"" for that if I could.) It is not a pry bar and it works great. You put the blade between the cover and the watch body and push the handle toward the watch (axial direction.) When you get to the end of the stroke the internal spring snaps and drives the cover off. For those of you who are familiar with spring loaded center punches it works the same way. The watch I used it on had no lip to get under for a blade type tool. I don't know how I would have gotten the cover off without this tool."
2,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately, didn't work for me. I couldn't open any of the several watch cases I tried that tool on (even after reading instructions and watching some youtube video). I think the tip is just not sharp enough to get between the case and the cover. It might work for some watches if you sharpen the tip, but if you are not careful you can easily scratch the case, damage your watch or hurt yourself with this tool. I found that a knife - watch case opener does much better job and easier and safer to use as well. I rarely return my orders, but I had to return that one."
5,It Really Works!,"I have a 25 year old watch that I had abandoned after not being able to change the battery for years. I was intrigued by the reviews of the tool that described success stories. I purchased the tool with a ""what do I have to lose?"" attitude and I am glad I did. I had the watch open in minutes. Very impressive tool. Thank you to the previous reviewers!"
2,What's This?!,"I must start by telling the truth. I haven't gotten to running this adventure through, and most likely I never will.I was very excited to get my hands on this firt Realms adventure for the 3rd edition rules and started reading it as soon as I got my hands on it. But to my dismay I found that the text seemed stale and the plot was very linear and overbearing taking away alot from the characters by instead placing too much emphasis on the historical aspect of the adventure.But perhaps it will be fun to play anyway I thought and proceeded to read it through. But when done I came to the conclusion that parts of the adventure was missing. There was crucial information that wasn't given in the text. Lacking this (and not being able to find a way around it) I have placed to book on the shelf where it will gather dust for ever more."
5,Awesome toy!,"My daughter (2 1/2 yrs) received this toy as a gift when she was born and still carries it around with her everywhere she goes. We've washed it a hundred times and, although faded from washing, still looks great! I love toys that can be washed!"
5,Great lovey,"My daughter goes to sleep with this toy every night. He is soft, cute and durable. She chews him, and he hasn't lost his shape. Not having any stuffing makes him very easy for little hands to grasp and hold onto. He's just the right size. I have washed it numerous times (in the washer and dryer) and he comes our cleaner each time. A great soft toy!"
3,Unadventurous Anti-American Funk/Reggae,"Musically - Bill Laswell's production is slick (everything in place) and fairly interesting as compared to much commercial music. But it's not nearly as adventurous or interesting as his own best work. I can't imagine someone who enjoys ""Memory Serves"" or ""Seven Souls"" really enjoying this album. It aspires to a fairly turgid commercial sound. The music combines elements of hip-hop, funk, and reggae - but not in any particularly adventurous way.Lyrically, the album has aged badly. And it's a bit comedic to me for a caucasian such as Laswell to sit and produce an effort like this with its talk of ""white devils"" and so forth."
2,Oh come on! A classic this is not.,"I would give this three stars, but I'm unnerved. This album is a) too short, b) not the Material I had hoped to find. I thought this was a find at a used place, and I expected Laswell's ambient techno side of Material to appear. Unfortunately only ""Drive-by"" and ""Glory"" are instrumental bordering on a mediocre version of what I wanted. The other, lyrical tracks are marred and overblown; I could not listen all the way through again, and I'm a very tolerant listener. I guess I just don't get it."
5,Barblie Prince Antonio Doll,My 4 yr old daughter absolutely loves this doll. She has played with him lots since the day we got him for her. His clothes come off easily too!
2,Other than giving Princess Ro someone to dance with.....,My daughter bought the Prince herself. He doesn't look much like the prince from the movie and doesn't do anything like the princesses. It'd be nice if her did something. My daughter played with him for a short time and then just put him up on the shelf with her other barbies.
4,Great read.,"This book is an easy read and has a great story line. Any high school/young adult reader would absolutely love it. There's a lot of character interaction and it doesn't have a lot of descriptive narrative so it keeps your attention throughout. The many surprises are a lot of fun. There's a section that's a real tear-jerker, as well. Everyone I know has cried at least once, if not twice, while reading Leaving A Mark. This book has it all and can be easily read in an evening. I highly recommend it to all young adults because it speaks to many of their issues. It has a hockey theme, but the terms are defined in the beginning and it can be understood even by those who don't know a thing about the sport."
1,The foolish journey,A lot of the material sounds good but is not provable. I worked the material and read the book several times. At first I believed the information was true for Lazaris told us he would never lie. Then last year he lied on one of his tapes so it's hard to know now what information is true and what isn't since on most of it we have to take Lazaris' word for it.Bottom line - A good fairy tale at best!
2,WHERE DO OUR GENDER-PERSONALITIES COME FROM?,"Rachel T. Hare-Mustin & Jeanne Marecek, eds.Making a Difference:Psychology and the Construction of Gender(New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 1990) 212 pagesFive feminist psychologists examine the history and resultsof research into differences between the sexesand the continuing controversies about 'gender'.This book is more an examination of the methods and language of researchthan application of the results to the everyday lives of women and men.Social constructionism and postmodernismare two schools of thought explored.Essential reading for anyone deeply involved in the gender debate.If you would like to discover other books on the gender debate,search the Internet for the following bibliography:""Best Books on Gender-Personality"".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."
3,Photo Ops with short blurbs,"I can't say I'm overly impressed by the information in this book, aside from the wonderful photography. I'd have liked more information on the various time periods as well as more directions for actually reproducing the items shown. (Not all items have directions with them.) Still, you could piece together most any of them with directions from throughout the book. The fabric sample photos at the back are helpful to get oriented to a time period, especially if you're not sure where to start. The Rag Rug section was a fun departure, as was how to cover walls with dust catchers, ahem, fabric. I'd borrow this one from a friend, or go with interlibrary loan if you can."
3,Not what was expected from the author,"I have a few other books from Judith Miller, and this one seemed more like a book that was written ""just because she can."" It does have the nice pictures and quite a bit of technical information, but those items are more for a drapery/upholstery work room. Not a whole lot of actual historical information that you would be able to turn around and apply to other pieces of material in day to day contact. A nice visual reference for extravagant window treatments and a few accessory pieces. The pictures are beautiful references for design ideas, but really a work room book or large scale budget interior design firm."
4,A surprise... from Gibson.,"While the screenplay has a few problems... basically with the exposure to radiation and how it's handled, the film is exciting enough to be thrilling.. and I enjoyed it."
5,A good thinker's movie,"I know ""Edge of Darkness"" has been around a while, and has a predictable, formula theme, but what I liked was the way the film explores the depths of mourning the loss of someone you love..... the shock, the ""saving"" of things, the protective ""instincts"", the respect and preservation of a 'daddy-daughter' relationship. Getting past the expected ""action"" scenes, which I still enjoy, I was happiest to see the care taken in preserving how each one involved must have felt. I'll watch this one for years to come."
3,Review of Mel Gibson's movie Edge of Darkness,"Mel Gibson has gotten a lot of bad rap lately and I wanted to see how he did in this movie.I was pleasantly impressed with him in this movie.Nothing to the caliber of his role in Braveheart, but the storyline was very interesting andkept you wondering until the very end. I would recommend it."
4,Very Entertaining,"This is part thriller, part suspense, and very good.It features Mel Gibson as widowed Boston Police detective Thomas Craven. His only daughter comes to visit and is rather ill. They are leaving to go to the hospital and she is shot and killed on his front steps. The killer yells 'Craven' as he is firing. Due to his work and ability to make enemies, everyone assumes that the shots were meant for the detective.As he starts looking into her death, he learns that she was going to become a whistleblower against her employer, a rogue corporation.To avoid spoiling it, I will not comment further on the plot. Suffice it to say, this is well done and well worth watching."
2,Awful,"What an awful movie.Seems like Hollywood will release anything these days and just because it has a big star in it they will think people will like it,wrong!This movie was not very intersting and couldn't hold my attention.I didn't like the characters and Mel Gibson's accent was annyoing.What a snooze fest.Don't even waste $1 at Redbox for this trash!"
2,Disappointing,Dialogue is labored and predictable. Story predictable also. Low energy. Dialogue hard to hear at times. Would pass on this one.
2,Edge of Pointless,"Hollywood is perpetually dredging for ideas. Last week it was comic book heroes, this week it's old BBC TV series. The BBC Series Edge of Darkness was an original, quirky and inspired drama that is still worth watching nearly three decades later. The casting was superb, the script for the most part tight, and the performances truly memorable. This film, which basically borrows the title and a few names from the BBC original, is silly, lightweight, badly written and poorly acted. Instead of a complex political drama we have John Wayne meets West Wing. There's really nothing much of merit in this film - it's a tired old ""one man against the world"" schtick and frankly we've been there, done that, and moved on a long time ago. So please, by all means acquire the BBC original but give this tired old movie a miss."
2,Very Boring!!!,"This movie was not at all what I expected. It has a promising storyline, but I didn't like the way that it was carried out. In fact, it was quite boring. There are hardly any action scenes, and I remember thinking to myself 'when is something interesting gonna happen?' Mel Gibson stars as Thomas Craven, a cop with nothing to lose when his daughter, Emma is murdered right in front of him. He goes on a personal vendetta to find out who killed her, and why. I also did not care for the ending. I would not recommend EDGE OF DARKNESS!!!"
5,awesome movie!,i LOVE suspense/thriller movies but the last several i've seen were so disappointing. i figured this one was going to be too but i was way wrong! it was GREAT! from beginning to very end! not all movies can pull off a great ending to go along w/a great movie but this one did! i highly recommend!
4,Finally a decent movie,This was an excellent film. Not usually a Mel Gibson fan and it probably wasn't his best role but the movie kept my attention the entire time. There were some very emotional moments as well. My only complaint was that it came off as a bit choppy when moving from once scene to another. Overall I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.
1,no dvd :(,"when i received this item, there was no dvd, however it was sealed completely, no signs of tampering. I would love to have seen this movie im not the only one this happened to, my friend has had it done to him twice"
5,Hard edge of darkness,Excellent movie! If your a Father with a daughter then this will strike home! I've watched this 5 times now just to remind myself what a good Father is.
5,EDGE of DARKNESS VERY MUCH A POSSIBILTY,"This film is one that gets you thinking about cover-ups. Very well done . Believeable bad guy. Plus, I wonder what else the goverment is hiding. Good film for mature adults."
3,MEL'S BACK,"Mel Gibson is back but he's no lethal weapon. Looking old and tired, he nonetheless gives a hearty performance in this complex and convoluted thriller. The plot's hard to follow and the pacing a little slow. I also found Ray Winstone's accent difficult to understand. Lena Headey was an effective mate for Gibson. While it held my interest, I wish it had been more intense in its delivery."
3,"it was ok, but it was missing something...","Seen this movie in theathers and the story and the concept is pretty solid, but the thing about this movie is that it lacked that ""Taken"" punch to it. I felt Mel Gibson shouldve been kicking more ass. He shouldve been more violent, and most of all, when he found out that the police were in on it, well he shouldve killed them all too. The ending of the movie really came through, but going throughout the movie I always felt like there were things missing from certain parts. If anything, please go rent this movie and see if you like it before you buy."
4,Liked it--definitely good enough to RENT!,Rented this movie from amazon and really liked the film. There were a couple of hokey areas like Mel Gibson's disappearing Boston accent but overall I enjoyed it. Definitely worthy of being rented!
1,Payback fail...,"I completely agree with Calamity Jane's review...so much so that I was compelled to writing my own. This is Mel at his worst. Don't buy this movie. Those looking for something more superior would fare better with the moviePayback - Straight Up - The Director's Cut [Blu-ray], which IMO, is Mel at his finest."
4,In spanish?,"Item arrived on time, but by the looks of it, it may be in spanish. That being said, I have seen this movie several times and absolutely love it. I have never really been a huge fan of Gibson, but in this movie he shines as a gritty avenger. I think I am going to return it, as I believe it is in spanish. Don't know how it happened at all. But I cannot downgrade my review of the movie because the seller made a mistake. Great movie, do yourself a favor and buy it."
3,Mel Gibson: Edge of Darkness,"I expected more from Mel. The plot line was OK but lacked punch, especially for those who like Gibson. I would not reccomend this movie to others."
4,Edge of Darkness,Excellent movie....movie arrived as promised in excellent condition as promised ....Mel Gibson does a really great performance in this movie
2,Poor fiction,"This is a Mel Gibson thriller with a, yet again, US government as villain theme. I wondered when the villainous US Senator is described as a Massachusetts Republican, a phenomenon not seen in Massachusetts politics until Scott Brown won the ""Kennedy seat"" last year. The story is weak although there are lots of people shot. The story is not up to the standards of similar fare. Avoid it unless you want another Hollywood slur on the left's enemies."
1,Old man Mel does not come through,"Before watching ""Edge of Darkness"" I had great expectations, since I am a fan of Mel Gibson. However, ""Edge of Darkness"" is a big disapointment.""Edge of Darkness"" is about a homicide detective Thomas Craven (Gibson) investigating the murder of his daughter. While investigating he learns of a secret life she was having.Mel Gibson's investigation, (which is what this film is about) is very boring. There are few action moments, and it seemed that whenever the camera showed Gibson, he was sitting with a blank expression on his face.""Edge of Darkness"" is a very boring film that is not interesting at all. It has similarities to the film ""Taken"" but is nowhere near as good."
1,short movie terrible ending,This movie was really good for about 30 minutes but then it started pixelating. It hung up on one pixelated image and would play no more. I tried forwarding to different points in the movie but it wouldn't play.
2,EDGE OF DARKNESS !,"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT THIS BEFORE YOU BUY IT ! I LIKE MEL ALOT BUT THIS MOVIE WAS DRAWN OUT, BORING, AND LEFT WAY TO MANY GAPS ! IF YOU THINK THIS IS A ACTION FLICK THINK AGAIN ! THE ACTION IS THERE FOR A SECOND OR TO AND GONE AGAIN ! IF YOU LIKE THESE REVENGE MOVIES. BUY "" TAKEN "" OR "" DEATH SENTENCE "" BOTH ARE WAY BETTER FLICKS. SORRY MEL YOU CAN DO WAY BETTER THAN THIS ONE !"
1,absolutely unappealing,"This is a very disappointing film.. It starts well and you expect a good police story, with a tough detec tive trying to solve the murder of his own dauighter who apparently is not what he tought she was. Unfortunately what happens is a confusing and unconvincing plot ful of cliches with empty and nonsense dialogues. When the British guy appears , smoking and talking to detective Craven it looked like a scene from X-files, the Smoking Man trying to convince Fox Mulder about the inevitability of certain events...Very boring."
3,about this DVDfilm/movie Edge of Darkness............,"Singapore had shown this film on theatre and it contains a shot dead body with bloody scene and nice actions....very nice film to view but the problem is talk something about politics...I have view this film in theatre and giv it a 3 star for this film (not too good a review as this film talks about some form of politival stuffs).........Review by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahAssistant FED chief (Internationale)"
3,Could have been better,The movie was oki thought it would have more action in itAfter seeing it for the first time not worth seeing it again
2,Edge of Darkness,Not one of his better movies. Being one of Gibson's first in front of the camera in a while this was not up to par with his acting in the past. Could have passed this one up.
2,Rent If You Must...2.5 Stars,"I won't bore you with a long diatribe that dissects this silly flick into its substanceless individual parts. Gibson seems to be pissed off he accepted the role, the ""Boston"" accent is annoying, the movie is clearly a half hour too long and, typical of movies like this, the characters fearing for their lives all do predictably stupid things. Two and a half stars for the kernel of an idea for a good movie and a few good action sequences. Unfortunately this one is pretty much a paint by the numbers affair with a lot of long boring sceens of faux acting used as filler for a weak story. Save your money and rent if you must."
4,Probably Mel Gibson's Last DVD,Very predictable and I'm sure this will be a collector's item some day as Mel Gibson's last effort until he blew up again temper wise.
5,'Some secrets take us to the edge',"First of all, don't be fooled by the media led character assassination of Mel Gibson. The guy has some flaws magnified by alcohol, but uses these flaws to fuel his acting skills which are nothing short of brilliant. This film has an atmospheric feel with some twists and turns along the way. The honesty and authenticity of Mel's performance is remarkable. Can't wait to see what this terrific actor comes up with in his next project."
3,Edge of Darkness,"Movie was OK, Mel Gibson has played better characters. The story was kind of long and drawn out. Otherwise, the movie was entertaining."
2,Too many holes in the story,"The story doesn't add up. The backstory is lacking for one. The daughter confides in a lawyer, senator, and reporter instead of talking to her own father?? The father and daughter supposedly have a close relationship but haven't spoken in years?? Too many supporting characters are crammed in. This movie was just stupid."
3,Action,"Edge of Darkness is action packed; however, it loses your attention 20 minutes into the film. I was disappointed because I like Mel Gibson and although his acting was good it takes more than one actor to make a movie. The plot was questionable at best."
3,Nice work by Mel Gibson,"Mel Gibson is a Boston Police detective whose daughter is murdered. First believing he was the target, it soon becomes apparent that his daughter was involved in something that put her life in danger. He tries to discover who the murderer is and why she was killed. A standard, but effective revenge drama, laced with the plotline of a conspiracy film. The storyline of the film is not too complex or convoluted, and Mel Gibson is convincing as the angry father out for answers and for revenge. This one is worth seeing."
5,hilarious,one of my favorites. a hilarious compilation of essays and excerpts from the funniest female writers all through history.
1,Bad product,"We received the product in time, but the product had a crack when we received it. Cheap plastic.Not worth the price."
5,What you see is what you get,I have bought 3 chairs 4 years ago and was so satisfied that I bought another 3. The assemblyn instructions are clear. The chairs are easy to clean and the hydrolics work perfect.
4,cypress,Great stools for my kitchen counter. Note that they the surface does scratch easily. They look great and function well. Very light and easy for kids to move around and are still stable enough for older toddles.
4,nice chairs,Very nice chairs easy to put together. Was surprised by the 5 year lift warrantee. The chairs are very comfortable and easy to adjust.
2,Neat seat,"This stool was much cheaper than available in stores. It is higher than I wanted, at its lowest level, however, it is so well made, I couldn't take it apart to return."
1,Garbage...,"Ordered two, returned two...both had cracked fiberglass, and one lower trim ring was split in half. My first total disappointment ordering from Amazon..."
1,NO NO NO NO NO,Yes this barstool is absolutely beautiful; but only if you are planning to look at it. I am 120lbs and I bought two stools. One of the stools broke and I contacted the seller. They said they would only replace the broke part (pieces were falling off from inside the chair). They ended up sending me a whole different chair. The seats are hollow and easily cracks on the inside. This is with simple sitting. First the lever will randomly give out. This is on three different chairs. Same thing. It was embarassing when people would visit and I would have to warm them about the seats. My heart dropped every time someone hopped on them. A friend about 160lbs sat on it and it cracked nearly to the top of the stool!Absolutely horrible and cheap feeling. $60 is a rip off for one! Don't do it unless its just to look at.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,I bought two of these barstool. They both had big scratches and paint was chipping. When we wanted to return it we had to pay 30 dollars extra for the shipping. I woud not recommend buying from this seller. I buy alot from amazon. This is by far the worst expirence I ever had. This is the first bad review I have ever written for an item because I am so pissed off.
2,Helpful and yet biased,"I have homeschooled for 13 years and taught special education before that. I manage a library for a church homeschool group I co-founded. I have read and bought just about every homeschool book ever written. If you want lots of information this book is fine. But beware, Mary Pride's biases and ignorant views of some subjects limits the usefulness of this book. As an unapologetic Christian, I felt attacked and demoralized by her ignorant raving."
1,Has Iron/Steel Worm Gear will Rust,"Thse clamps say they are stainless steel, however only the band was stainless. The Worm gear is made of Iron-steel ! The metal looked funny, so I checked with a magnet. We get similar Ideal-Tridon clamps elsewhere ( for less cost) , and they definately do not stick to a magnet. Over the years I have already been fooled by this. Kept in a moist or humid enviornment these will rust and eventually fail. Rusty clamps look bad, stain adjacent surfaces, are hard to remove, and may not hold properly. Basically do not know of any reason to recommend these clamps."
5,an excellent martial arts instructor,"a well organized book. Its about a man who reached the peak of his profession as a martial arts instructor. His most famous student - Bruce Lee - overshadowed him, But I would rather study under Ip Man than Bruce Lee."
2,Great subject poorly executed,"If you are looking for a collection of pictures of the all time wing chun master, the book is fine. But if you are looking for wing chun content, in terms of theories, old fashion training (the way wing chun was traditionally taught, before the bad influence of the american way of life.....not being patient for the necessary time, etc); To clarifying the big public about, who were in fact the students who had a very near relation to the grandmaster. Then you will be very dissapointed with this book. It does not add anything to what was written before."
3,It's Okay,Purchased 2 pairs for hubby and I ti used during our numerous trips during the holiday. I could not tell if it made a difference.
3,sock it to me,"Socks are ok. They seem to lose a bit with washing but they are ok. For more compression, I'd go with a running sock, etc. Depends on what you want."
5,Great Comfort - Will Buy More,A bought them for a trip to Europe after reading several medical articles about DVT. Wow! They are truly comfortable. No leg pain at all on the long flight. I now wear them on all flights no matter the length. I'm going to get a couple of more pair for auto trips and anything where I will be seated for long periods of time. Buying these is just the safe thing to do if you travel any at all.
1,disappointment,"Jules Destrooper, Cookie Thins Almond 100G, 3.5-OunceThis proved to be an all time ripoff. I was expecting a broken case of cookies. I received 1 box of cookies worth $3 - paid $9.95 for the cookies, plus $6.30 for shipping. $16.25 for a $3 value. Never again will I shop Amazon. Richard Rossi"
3,"Good quality, but it's just not Aya","This statue/figure is pretty good quality and fairly large. The main problem I have with it is that it doesn't really look like Aya from the video games. Also, the breasts are too small and the sexuality of the figure overall has been played down. Also, the skin shade is a bit too light for my tastes. However, it is painted well and the bikini Aya is wearing seems to be the downloadable one in the Xbox 360 game. It's relatively inexpensive, so even if you don't like it you're not out a whole lot."
4,Chlorhexidine Solution 2%,"I use this product as a spot treatment for itchy rashes, bug bites, bee stings, cleaning cuts or scrapes, or just adding it to bath water for my dog. The recommended mixture is a two tablespoons per gallon of clean water. I have found it works quite well at that concentration. A gallon jug will make several gallons of cleaning solution and last a long time."
1,Waste of money!,"Completely useless piece of film making, why did IMAX bother? Picture quality bears no resemblance to other IMAX productions such as ""Africa The Serengeti"" and the transfer to DVD has been done very poorly. The background sounds of the rainforest are completely marred by a terribly delivered commentary which sounds as if it were intended for 5 year olds. Any adult of average intelligence will learn nothing from the commentary that they didn't already know. Don't waste your money."
1,Worthless,"I bought this Blu-ray Tropical Rainforest and it was the worse documentary I have ever seen in my life. The whole video last about 20 minutes, the sound was awful. I returned it to Amazon.com and end up to pay for shipping back and restocking fees since I openned the item. It end up costing me 60-70% and I got a refund of about 30% back of my purchased price. Never buy this product unless you are a NO Brainer or want to waste you $$ like me."
2,Worst documentary on the Rainforest I ever seen!,"This movie had poor content, I know more facts about the Rainforest than this movie presented. I don't think an overview of the Rainforest will cut it, should be more in-depth!"
2,should have been better,"The first 20 minutes or so is some beautiful footage of the rain forest and the narrator has a Jamacian accent which is kinda entertaining. However, after that the rest of the film is just some tree-hugging hippie crap that goes on and on and on and on. Footage of one cut down tree after another. If I wanted to be preached to by a bunch of hippies that don't have a clue to what they're talking about anyway I wouldn't need to pay for it, I'd just go to the Health food store, ask for a paper bag and set it on fire!! They had a great start but should of been better. :( Lameness!!"
3,Not so bad after all,"Now come on! This documentary deserves at least a 3 1/2 star rating. It's expensive and rather short like all other IMAX films but at least it tries to send us the message that humans are screwing around with the rainforests. The point of this film is just that, to remind us of the extinction of animals and plants due to human greed and stupidity! When the animals are gone for ever, humans will follow.........WAKE UP!!!! Save the rainforests!!!!!!"
5,Perfect Purchase!,"They fit true to size according to listed size chart (just make sure when buying Berkshire brand you match up the correct style number to the size chart). The navy ones I bought were darker than I thought but still great. These feel awesome and very sturdy. Easy to get on, plenty of stretch without sagging or bunching. I am buying more of these right now!"
1,Run VERY Small,I was really excited to find good quality opaque queen tights. I read some of the other reviews and saw these run small so I ordered 3 sizes larger than what I wear. I wear a 3x and I bought a pair that were 5x/6x and they STILL don't fit. I couldn't even pull them up all the way up. They seem really thick but I can't put them on.
5,AMAZING!!:),"I loved this book! I thought that Darrell would never find any friends in his new school, Bluford High. I felt sorry for him for being bullied by Tyray, but I was happy when he stood up to him. I would have done the same thing to a bully in my school. But, overall I absolutly recomend you read this if you have any problems with a bully or if you know someone that is, or if you just like to read than read this book."
5,THE GOSSIP CHIC REVIEW,"I choose to read THE BULLY because it had action & character. You should read this book. This book is mainly about a boy name Darrell Mercer in his new life & school, and also a new bully. After facing fear for a few months Darrel decides to knock the Bully name Tyray down to his place. I like this book because when people bully people the other person gets bullied back. I would offer this book to a bully that needs to learn his or her lesson to not bully kids, because kids nowadays die of bullying."
5,A welcome addition...,"Since visiting Ellis Island's Museum, I have been collecting adult and children's books about the trials and tribulations that my ancestors had to endure, at Ellis Island. This book is a great addition to those books!"
2,Kiss it goodbye,"After a fascinating introduction and prologue, the book became tedious and boring, too many details of hospitalizaton and illness and not enough about culture"
1,temperting machine rev 2....i bough this machine and it started smoking and never worked.,the tempering machine new rev 2 is a wast of money...i got one that burned and stop working in my first try. i hade an awfull experience and di not get my money back.
3,Entertaining blend of science fiction action,"All is a matter of taste. If you enjoy science fiction movies, you might like this one. It has a blend of Independence Day, The Professional, The Matrix and Terminator. It's not original but it is entertaining."
4,Returner - smart action at its best,"It only took me 4 months to finally sit down and watch this movie from when i first heard about it, and I am upset that I did not watch it sooner.yes this movie borrows heavily from the Terminator, Independence Day, Matrix, and a couple of other western movies, but it also makes them its own.Great acting and the script is top notch. The action is well done, and during a bit of a slow stretch during the middle of the movie it is compelling to watch the chemistry between the actors. Especially the Hero and the Villian.Highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Japenese action movies."
5,Combo of Red Bull Speed,"I know that I will defentaly have to see this film again. Japanese movies are getting that sleek futuristic look and Returner is chock full of it. Although I have to admit, there seem to be a lot of ""homages"" ranging from Matrix, Men in Black to Fifth Element, X-Files and so on. Still, it's an action packed with cool style to boot.The main hero and butt whooping babe work well together. From martial arts, lasers, guns, explosions, action scenes are rapid that you're left blinking in awe. I defentaly think towards the final 30 minuites, it does seem to go on a tangment and a friend and I were trying to piece together what we could keep up. The CG is used well in enhancing the style of the film, especially the futuristic technology stuff."
5,would have been a 50 million box office hit in america.,This was my first subtitled movie that I bought by accident.After 15 mins. into the movie I forgot the subtitles.The action and acting were great and its a good story.Great graphics.This is a must see!!!!
4,Fun Yakuza Sci-Fi!,"Sci-fi can be done especially cheesy and this was by far not cheese at all. It was well directed, had cool special effects and an intriguing enough plot. Having the Yakuza theme was a bonus. The acting was good as well and touching enough to please without being sugary. Of course I always watch foreign films in their original language. I also liked the near equal combination of violence, action and story. I enjoyed this film and recommend it..."
2,I thought it was just okay...,"The movie was just okay. It could have done something more with it's subject matter. It's not something that I would go out and buy right away, but if you have a little scratch in your pocket, and the movie you wanted to buy is sold out, then try Returner. Some cool matrix-like effects, but after watching it, I didn't remember nothing that I'd seen. Not the worst I've seen, but far from the best."
1,brrrrrrrrr..... not brilliant,"I try this flick because of main character from ""Sleepless town"" and should state I look in disbelief at previous 70 positive reviews. All this shooting and special effects go on mainstream TV every day so why we need more? Aliens invaded? We couldnt handle our problems without aliens why we need more? After all this is movie where I expect entertainment, imagination and maybe a lesson but not propaganda and brainwashing."
3,Eh....,"I'm glad I chose to rent this first instead of buying it. The plot was extremely weak. For the most part this movie was fairly uninteresting. However, there were a handful of very short action scenes that were cool and fun to watch, which is why I gave this a 3 instead of a 1. Do yourself a favor and RENT it first."
5,MASTER OF The Rare LASERDISCS Movies.,"I have Returner: Limited Deluxe Edition (2 Disc Box Set: Region-2) The Japanese BOXSET,Returner is A MASTERPIECE ,Give it a try you won't regret it :)"
3,Back to the future,"'Returner' is a real find - a vividly imagined time-travel thriller with not-cheesy FX and a cool visual style. It's a live action movie, but the swagger and sense of humor in 'Returner' come straight from Japanese anime and Manga. It's also a buddy flick whose two leads - a male hitman and a female time-traveler - make a combative, likeable odd couple. Check it out, especially if you're into the 'Terminator' and 'Ghost in the Shell' franchises."
4,Excelent Sci-fi,"This is an excellent sci-fi flick. There are some weak moments of acting and the special effect, while awesome when new, are showing there age a little. If your looking for a fun and fast paced sci-fi movie you don't have to look much further than this."
1,oh dear,"well, it could have done with finishing a lot earlier. some nice cinematography, decent bird, but it's bloody awful. poxy dialogue, bits of various old movies shamelessly ripped out (terminator, matrix, back to the future, flight of the navigator- i think they even used some of the props from ET). don't bother."
1,Wish i had my money back,"i bought this game with high hopes, and regretably paid the full $50, there are way too many things wrong with this game to list. Do NOT buy this game"
1,Don't hold your breath...,"The track itself is a good set of remixes of the Jones & Stephenson classic ""The First Rebirth"". The Sunbeam mix is the pick of the pile, while Mellow-D's and Talla's are fairly good as well. The reason I gave this 1 star was for its availability. I waited nearly four months for this to arrive in stock, but it never did when finally I received an email saying it was unavailable. I recommend the Sunbeam remix, but good luck tracking it down."
2,A GOOD FILM TO DO LAUNDRY BY!...,"I had High Hopes when I got this Movie with such terrific Cast and all...This is the Story of two Mexican Families living in Los Angeles all their lifes, one Rich one Poor...Wow that's a new Premise ...Some Characters in the Film never had eaten nor seen Mexican Food before, if you can believe that!...Well, it gets even better, how about Pauly Shore playing the part of some Flamboyant Interior Decorator with a Bad Beehive Blond Wig muttering some High School Spanish every now and then...or was it French?...Well, it doesn't matter, Yes, you know the Rest.""The Princess and the Barrio Boy"" has a lot of problems, it has it's good moments but unfortunately not many of them, it's one of those Films you watch while doing something ells...like Laundry or...Folding Sheets, so it doesn't seem like you're wasting your time, in fact by the time the Movie Ended, I have done Thee Loads!"
4,A Good Light Read.,This book was fun and easy to read. It held my attention but it is not as good as the Stephanie Plum series.
4,reread,Full Speed has Max and Jamie going after the minister that put the hit out on them in the last book. They both go under cover and discover alot of distubing news. This book is better than the last of course it doesn't have that huge gap the last did at the begining.
5,Full Speed,I have read 41 of Janet Evanovich's books and I love them all. They hold my attention and I do not want to put them down. Janet Enanovich and Charlette Hughes do a great job. I would like to see more of their books. I tell all my friends about the books.
3,"Full Speed, Janet Evanovich",This book has been around for a long time but every page was intaact and I do suggest you purchase used books as you can get maore to read and fill your head with good fun...Enjoy
1,Evanovich should stick with Stephanie Plum,"I agree so totally with Mayfayre's review that I couldn't even finish this book. It was a terrible disappointment. The characters are flat, the dialogue boring (yeah, as Max or Jamie would say) and you could almost pick out the few parts that evanovich had a hand in.The first two ""Full"" books had promise, though not up to Stephanie Plum. This one falls horribly flat. Nobody could believe Max and Jamie are real people. Even the hypochondriac Dave is annoying - worried about much more than a hypochondriac would be, worried about more than a real psycho would be. He's just plain nuts, and the other characters don't pull you in at all.I wish evanovich wouldn't waste her time on these books, and spend more time on the plum series, which, written on her own, are clever and funny and interesting. Please, more Stephanie Plum and no more of this nonsense."
3,It's not a Stephanie Plum book...,"I, too, am an avid reader of the Stephanie Plum (SP) novels. Janet Evanovich (JE) can't write them fast enough for me. As another reader mentioned, I was having a JE reading withdrawl, so I bought Full Speed. I didn't expect it to be like SP, but I expected it to be just as funny. Not quite...I have to say that I hated ""Muffin"" in this book. As unbelieveable as some of the things JE writes about are, Muffin was going overboard! The main characters somewhat reminded me of a SP/Joe Morelli/Ranger type of attraction, but didn't come close to exuding the same energy or attraction.The book was somewhat entertaining. It had its slow parts. I thought the last 100 pages were probably the best since the story started to really come together.Go buy the 1-9 Stephanie Plum novels instead. Guaranteed you will NOT be disappointed in those!"
5,Book Review,"Full Speed (Janet Evanovich's Full Series)I ordered the book ""Full Speed"" by Janet Evanovich (paperback).I was really impressed with the quickness of delivery and the great condition of the book. I will definately be ordering more books from this person again."
2,Better to read the Stephanie Plum series...,Disappointing. I can recommend the Stephanie Plum series but not the _Full_ collaborations.
2,Disappointing to a Plum Fan,"The plot is corny, and the characters are cartoonish and flat. Look elsewhere for an enjoyable read."
1,Painful,"I purchased this as a book on CD and it was horribly dull. I kept waiting for something ""meaty"" but the characters were completely flat. The voices on the Audio book were horrible and the Marilyn Monroe voice of the car was completely far fetched. It never came together as a book and I was so glad when it was over.This was the first Janet Evanovich book I read(listened to) and I am not willing to waste more of my time with future novels."
2,NOT the Evanovich I know and love,"*Sigh* I want to start off saying how much I adore Janet Evanovich' stephanie plum novels...they're witty, concise, fun, etc. This isn't. I think that this book is more her lending her name to a friend who can't really write. Not only is the plot TOTALLY ridiculous, it is written very poorly. Jamie is falling for Max, an uber-rich, genius, James Bond-esque character who has created Artificial Intelligence, so he has a talking car named Muffin, who happens to think she is in menopause. Sheesh! I could forgive the weak plot if it was written well and/or amusing, but it's not. There is ZERO character development, and you only ever know what a character is feeling because they tell you...there is no ""showing."" Jamie will say things like ""Oh dear, I'm falling in love with Max"" and so that's how the reader knows...not because there's been any chemistry or interaction between them. There were a few times that I laughed during the story...but they were few and far between."
1,What a let down.,After 9 1/2 Stephanie Plum novels I was excited to try a new series. But this was a clunker.
1,Full of something................,This book was horrid. Janet Evanovich is ruining her reputation lending her name to this rubbish. She should concentrate on her wonderful Stephanie Plum novels!
1,Every bit as lackluster as its predecessor.,"I thought the last book ('Full Tilt') from these two authors was drivel but I also thought it was just a bad bump in the road of good reading. After three outings (I'm a slow learner) I now see that I cannot expect better things to come from this series of books. I remain a fan of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, but the 'Full' series is uninspired, unoriginal, and downright uninteresting. This is the last of them that'll vacuum the currency out of my wallet."
1,not good,"This isn't just a romance. It's worse. Take a generic romance novel, with lame characters, and meld it with an episode of the old Knight Rider television show, and you've got it. How and why could an author capable of the humor and wisdom that we see in the Stephanie Plum books, put her name on a book like this?"
4,"A NICE BREAK FROM ""CHICK-LIT""","By the looks of the reviews below and the ""star rating"" for this novel, I must honestly say I probally would have never picked up this book if I had read these reviews first.I usually read the cliche british chick lit books where someone is in PR and dating [""jerks""] aimlessly. I was surprised while reading this novel to not be along the same lines. I have only read ""Rocky Road to Romance"" and I naturally thought this novel would be the same but I came to discover there was more mystery and suspense. Very intriguing.Overall, I enjoyed this book, it was short, a quick read, and a nice break from the novels I am used to.Give it a try. Don't knock it until you tried it. I am glad I didn't.Happy Reading!"
5,all plants doing well,The day they came they were heat stressed and did not look to good--it was one of those early hot days of summer. But it is fall now and they are all looking good. I rec this nursery. The plants are all packed fairly well and come in fairly good condition. The website just isn't as easy to use for Hirts gardens as some of the larger sites--as far as it being organized to find the type of plant you want quickly. You just have to scroll through the entire list of perenials to see what they have.
4,Good product,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, then found out he preferred the type in a pump bottle, not the spray kind. However, he says that it is superior to other spray waxes and seems to work nearly as well as the pump kind. Overall, a quality product."
3,Just OK,Tried this wax and not that great in terms of shine. My wife cannot tell the difference and neither can I but it does make the paint smoother. It is easy to put on and took little time but not much shine.
2,Much better products on the market,"Completely useless on my black Cadillac CTS-V. Washed and dried car.Applied as instructed and a complete disaster. It looks greatfrom 5 ft but when looked closely, it leaves a nasty film residue.Had to rewash the car and wax using Zymol cleaner wax.Complete waste of effort."
2,"not much shine, no protection","this stuff does make the paint feel smooth but very little shine. the only use i find with this product is to spray it on a paste wax after the paste hazes and the hardened wax will wipe off easy. also if you washed your car and its still wet, spray this on and wipe and it will be easy to dry. it is a quick detailer and not that great of one either. it does take the white residue off plastic moldings left from a real wax. i also used it to wet the paint before using a clay bar and to spray on the applicator pad when using a real wax."
1,READ THIS YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!,"Hey, I just want everyone to know how bad this product it. I just a normal consumer just like yourself, and would just like to tell you how just a piece of crap this product is. I actually called Eagle One (Valvoline), and they basically told me had been using too much. So I used less. SAME RESULT, hazy, oily, terrible shine. I called again and they tell me they never had problem with this product, that they have done everything to test the product that the prouduct is practically flawless, easy, ""no buffing or heavy polshing even in sun or shade."" I been washing, polishing, and detailing my cars for 15 years. I probably used 80% of the junk on the market. THIS IS FAR THE WORST! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!"
5,Great Wax,This is the easiest to apply wax I have ever used. Almost just like polishing furniture. It leaves zero residue and a great shine. Not sure how long it lasts yet.
5,Comprehensive and Objective,"As a MBA student with a great interest in the consulting field I felt that this book is a really outstanding buy. It provides a very comprehensive ""partner's view"" of the consulting (being it legal or management) world and yet is very objective and down to earth. I highly recommend it for those interested in understanding the nuts and bolts of what makes a successful professional service practice."
5,Following this book one can grow a real professional,"The book is outstanding. It's very simple to read and very understandable even for non-English-speaker. It helps to resolve problems, especially in Marketing and HR, but, which is much more important, first it helps to identify and articulate problems. The most spectacular feature is an attempt, and extremely succesful one, to see professional services from Client's perspective: each proessional involved into Customer service should read it and try to follow its advices."
5,Great concepts and easy to read,Very well written and presents some very cogent concepts that help one understand the structures of modern professional service firms. Useful for establishing a common language with which to communicate with other professional service firm managers and for helping determine the appropriate direction for growing your firm.
5,A Great Resource,I have used this book to implement many new processes into my business. This sits in my bag or on my desk all the time. It's a great resource.
4,Getting things straight,"This is an excelent book for anyone effectively running or working or even considering hiring a professional services firm. The book is extremely structured. It begins with the basics, the fundamentals of the business model, defining concepts like leverage, classifying the engagements by types, etc. After the basics are established, it goes through the most important elements for defining success: client, people etc. It is an excelent book, and after reading it, you don't need much more than that to understand this kind of industry. It is a deep work, very clearly written and useful to read. The only things that could be explored are some ""real-life cases"". All the concepts are developed in a pretty general way. Anyone experienced in the industry knows that all the topics are solidly rooted in practice, but discussing some cases could add some ""spice"" to the text and make the reading more pleasant."
5,Maister is the one who goes straight to the point,"As a consultant from a worldwide company, I can assure it's one of the best texts I've ever read. The simplicity of its language, associated to the depth and trueness of its message, drives us to easy-to-apply conclusions. A book to be carried with you !"
2,Not very interesting,"There was not much new information contained within this book. The beginning was OK, but then very boring. Would not recommend to buy or read."
5,A Guide Map,"Prof. Maister detail in this book all management dimensions in a Service Firm. He provides helpful and powerful insights to every one interested in this market. Being you a beginner or a senior in your profession, you will always find important, helpful and practical orientation on how doing business and improve in this market.It is a classic."
5,Great ideas on management,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book's ideas and pointers on running a firm. These are useful and implementable suggestions. Well Done.Also recommend a practical and easy-to-read book at Amazon.com on leadership that would complement this excellent book well. It's called ""The Leader's Guide: 15 Essential Skills."""
3,Godd for reading but not a bible let's say...,"Nicely structured book including many aspects of managing a professional service firm with all the peculiarities it might have. However, the writer includes only its personal opinion from his experience while I would prefer some stronger academic back-up (study results, quantitative or qualitative surveys etc.)."
3,Not great,"Kind of a cheap feeling silk tie. Looks fine though. Ties nicely. Not the softest tie I've felt, which is surprising as it is made of silk."
1,Uses Plastic. Not a replacement,"I bought these blades for my 1964 Cadillac. Although the arm of the blade is a good match, the attachment of the blade to the arm on the car is a gray plastic.I returned the blades to Amazon who has great service and bought just the refill so I could keep my existing blades."
3,Machine Stand,"This stand is probably exactly as it appears - a laminated, formed wood product. I guess I was expecting more.It would be great for a typewriter, but I needed it for a heavier piece of equipment for our graphics office.Part of the wood split while being put together, so my husband had to buy ""L"" brackets to reinforce it to ensure it can support the weight of the equipment."
2,Difficult to Assemble,"Conceptually this is a good stand that has well-written assembly instructions, but some of the parts don't fit. The wood screws are too large in thread diameter for the pre-drilled holes and even for the holes in the two hindges for the side arm. I had to redrill the holes in the very hard composite material with a 1/8"" bit and even then I had to use a power driver to insert the screws. The four wheels were very difficult to drive into place.All in all, this was a tough piece to put together."
2,Looks can be deceiving!,"The stand looks just like one I bought decades ago, but the quality of the Lorrell unit leaves a lot to be desired.I had a problem assembling the first machine stand I ordered. The screws stripped the wood when I tried to push it across the carpet after assembling it, so it was unusable. I ordered a second one and had a similar problem. Although the second stand is being used, the wood also is pulling away from the screws and the table looks like it will collapse any minute.In fairness to the seller, I never issued a complaint other than this review. So I did not let them know I had a problem or give them a chance to correct problem with either product. However, I am willing to give them a chance to fix the problem."
2,Great idea falls short.,Our kids never play with this and it sat in the bottom of the toy box till I chucked it. The pin is to short and the stand is to small. The quality was simple at best. I was very excited about this indoor toy and it was a dud for us. Give the kids a box instead.
2,Simple Horseshoes for Toddlers,"I grew up in Florida where in our backyard was a homemade horeshoe 'run' complete with metal stakes, sand pits, and real horseshoes. It was a fun game and our whole family enjoyed it. I purchased this item as a fun game to be played at my wedding. We purchased about 5 outdoors games that would be set up on the large lawn at the golf club we were married at. This was the worst. I opened it to set it up and realized that this was made for kids (5+) and would not suffice. It is too lightweight for anyone over the age of 10 to use. The stakes do not stand up properly. The entire set it made of rubber and looks like it wouldn't last long. If you are an adult looking for a game that you would like to have travel with you to other locations, say a camping trip, this is not the set you want. Would make a great first timer tots game - but other than that, not worth the time, the effort, or the money."
4,Recomended,The kit was in great condition.Wish the stakes would stand up when the horseshoe hit it.The family had a great time with it.
3,This item did not fit my WRT-54GL,"Even though the description says it will fit a WRT-54GL model, ""RP-TNC is a common connector for wireless routers. Relocate your current Wi-Fi antenna to..."" it doesn't. One end screwed on to the router... the other end didn't even remotely fit the antenna. After waiting for over a week, I found this to be very disappointing. Amazon was gracious enough to take the items back and refund my payment."
5,A Charming and Bubbly Romance!,"""Brocade and Silk Stockings"" is a fast-paced and breezy read that offers plenty of intrigue, romance, and finely-detailed Parisian atmosphere. Author Taylor creates a plucky, likable, and three-dimensional protagonist in Toni Harris while love interest Kyle Kelly is Toni's match and more. The romance of Paris springs from every page as Toni, a graduate student writing her thesis, takes time out to explore the mysteries of her own family background and the more-than-50-year-old secret kept by her loving grandfather, Papa.""Brocade and Silk Stockings"" is the perfect book to take to the beach or curl up with beside the fire. If you love mystery and romance you will love this novel. Highly recommended."
4,good stuff,"I always wondered what happened to this band. Growing up in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, I remember their music getting some airplay, especially ""Time Bomb"" and ""Heartbreaker."" This disc blends most of what I like and remember about the 80s; it channels Billy Squier, Prizm, Foreigner, Def Leppard, and maybe Loverboy. The power ballads that never made the radio are actually quite melodic--the band just had a signature sound!"
4,"Faithful Shakespeare, Well-Acted","This BBC production of Hamlet is incredibly faithful to the original work by Shakespeare. I am no expert on the man, but I have read Hamlet, and the dialogue seemed to be incredibly accurate. The performances by David Tennant and Patrick Stewart are truly magnificent in the life and depth they give their characters, and the other performers are no slouches either. Two things are worth noting. One is that although the dialogue is old Shakespeare, the visual imagery is somewhat modernized (cameras, guns, etc). The other is that the movie does come in at a full three hours, so be prepared. If you think you can deal with these aspects and enjoy the original Shakespeare play, I would highly recommend this adaptation."
5,Best Hamlet ever.,"This performance sets a new standard for how Hamlet should be performed. David Tennant, Patrick Stewart, and the rest of the cast are nothing short of incredible."
4,"""Thine eyes see into my very soul""","What a wonderful version of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet!"" All of the emotions and facial expressions I imagine when reading the play are conveyed when I watch this version. I was so excited to see that David Tennant was cast as the lead role. He performs the mad, confused prince with intrigue and perfection! Between Tennant and Stewart, this version is my favorite yet (which is certainly saying something, because I normally hate modernizations of Shakespearean plays)!The only reason I gave the movie 4 stars rather than 5 is because it was over three hours long, and was a tad slow at points (this was only because they stayed with the script verbatim, which isn't necessarily a bad thing), and because at the very end, the dying was slightly unbelievable. This is just nitpicking, though. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Hamlet!"
4,easily digested version,"I semi-watched, mostly listened to this version and Shakespeare was made easily understood and the pacing was very good. There's nothing wrong with this version. David Tennant makes a very nice Hamlet in that the actor is very nice to look at, to think of and to listen to. And if Hamlet the character wasn't as pleasant, then he wouldn't have been a threat, he wouldn't have been tolerated for fear of public outcry. It sucks to be in the top circle of royal power at a time in history when one couldn't just leave safely with a trust fund . By the end of it, the three family members even the sneaky and the pragmatic seem to be relieved to be relieved of it all. David Tennant's Hamlet emphasizes how smart and astute his and the other characters are."
1,Blaming the victims,"Andrew Mango is a well-known denier of the Armenian Genocide and this book is unfortunately predictable both in the facts it highlights or suppresses and in its conclusions. He glorifies the Ottoman past of the country and (at best) denies without any evidence documented instances of suppression of non-Turkish ethnicities. The most disturbing feature of the author's approach is the indifference to human suffering he exhibits throughout the book. For example, deniers of the Armenian genocide typically make sure to stress what a terrible tragedy the death of so many thousands of people was, even though they deny the characterization 'genocide'. Not A. Mango. He barely mentions the events of 1915, but he spends pages and pages condemning ""Armenian Terrorists"", Armenian conspiracies etc. Any qualities of the book are unfortunately dwarfed by such exhibits of callousness and blaming of the victims."
5,A New Discovery,"I throughally enjoyed this book. It was an ""a-ha"" awakening. Taking myself out of the comfort zone, and seeing a new and energized perspective on business and life.I definetly recommend this book to everyone."
5,sandbox wisdom,"I found the book to be a wonderfully engaging reminder and teacher of brand essence. A fast enjoyable read that will make you run the gamut of emotions. It is my hope that my competitors don't read it!James D HendrixVP of Marketing Visual Persusion, LLC"
5,House Of Tsang Wok Oil -- ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL!,"Love it! I only use a few drops in my wok with seasoned fish or chicken to start the stir fry. I don't stir fry in actuality but place fresh greens (spinach, collards, broccoli rabe or other) on the top and add about 1/4 cup of water, then cover and let the whole thing simmer. Sometimes I add a few drops of the oil over the greens. Such a wonderful Asian flavor. First purchased House Of Tsang Wok Oil in a Target store but have never seen it again -- needless to say, in any store. The oil goes a long way and lasts a long time so it is well worth whatever price you pay."
4,Convient Drive,"So many people are trying to find new convient ways to store all their computer files, with USB Flash Drives. Although there are a handfull to choose from Sandisk knows how to make some of the most high-quality devices that you can easily and securely store your music, your big files and your video files. Their 512 MB Cruzer Micro is a sleek and convient way of storing all your important papers without the need of installing any software to your computer. Although it is very inexpensive, I honestly wish that there could've been more room to store software, considering part of the USB Flash Drive contains protective software to safely secure the files, but deleting the secure software would damage the USB drive. Still if you're going to get the Cruzer Micro, you'll get a flash drive that makes computer owners feel that their files are safe from harm. I absolutely recommend it.Price: B+Storage: B-Software: C+Overall: B 1/2-"
1,Use with Caution!,"In theory the U3 sounds great...but in practice I've just lost about 4 hours uninstalling/re-installing my Nero and the flash drive still crashed my system. I tried to remove it with the U3 removal tool I downloaded at scandisk main website and that stopped responding as well. And now the disk is completely un-useable. This is the second one I""m going to have to return to the store. I'm going to try and get my money back on this one and try and find a usb flash drive without the extras."
1,Beware U3,"Love the physical size and form-factor. But I did not realize when I bought it that U3 would self-install on my laptop and basically change the data key into something else entirely. I just wanted to use it as a data key and not worry about having to use the U3 LaunchPad to ""eject"" the drive, etc.Worse (for me) is that this version of the Cruzer is not supported for Win98. Two of the computers I use are still Win98. It took alot of googling and even a bit of registry editing to get this drive to work on all my computers. I reformated the drive using the ""U3 Launchpad Removal Tool"" available from SanDisk, and found a generic USB storage device driver called nusb24e.exe (use at your own risk) that allowed me to use the drive on the Win98 computers.If I had known about these issues I would have gotten an older version of Cruzer."
4,66 YEARS OLD AND STILL GOING!!!!,"Hitchcock was so good that after all of these years (Decades Actually) his movies still amaze and, astound us ! Sure this little Gem has some hokey spots but we all do after 66 years! Watch it as if its a modern day re-creation and you will forget any minor flaws. After all don't modern directors include them in their new versions of Noir films intentionally! The EXTRAS are eye opening too!!!"
3,Second-Rate Hitchcock Is Better Than None,"Though not on par with ""Foreign Correspondent,"" Alfred Hitchcock serves up some classic sequences in ""Saboteur"" (1942) - a flawed yet entertaining wartime thriller. Budget limitations prevented the Master of Suspense from acquiring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck for the lead roles. Instead, we're saddled with the ineffectual Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, who belong in a light romantic comedy rather than a Hitchcockian adventure. Still, there is memorable villainy from Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd plus the famous Statue of Liberty climax."
4,Great B Hitychcock,"Alfred Hitchcock rarely worked with B actors and production teams. In Saboteur he did, and produced a charming film that reflected his ongoing concerns of trust and guilt/innocence. The Statue of Liberty sequence is worth the price by itself.This film is a great companion piece to The 39 Steps and North By Northwest."
3,Mediocre Hitch,The Bottom Line:Saboteur is mainly remembered for its climax at the Statue of Liberty (which is actually rendered rather tame due to the supposedly-tense lack of music) which is fitting since it's a completely forgettable film otherwise; if you're a fan of the Master you might want to check it out but otherwise watch North by Northwest or The 39 Steps instead.2.5/4
1,Wartime propaganda - not a real movie,"Saboteur is more propaganda than film. The plot seems like an excuse to make someone's political point. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is studying the propaganda and putting it in a historical context.After seeing this movie, it's obvious to me that the 5 star rave reviews are, most likely, from people who have a stake in selling this DVD. Shame, shame!Saboteur could be an excellent basis for a drinking game. Every time someone makes a speech or says something about freedom or America, take a drink. Midway through the movie, you'll be toasted."
3,good quality but too long,"I'm about 6 ft tall, and the shirt is too long on me. I bought a regular, not a tall. Fine if you tuck it in, but who wants to do that all the time?"
5,Wonderful!,"I bought the Navy Blue shirt for my father who absolutely loves it! He really likes the feel of the fabric and it looks very nice. He is a large man and if he isn't comfortable, he won't wear it. It is also holding up very well which is nice, since he wears it a lot! The color hasn't faded and the fabric hasn't snagged in the washer."
3,"Nice, but one bad characteristic","Nicely made, sharp looking shirt. If used during athletic activity it is quite comfortable and cool as the Dri Power claims. It also is wrinkle free. But the bad thing, being 100% polyester, is almost any activity, even just standing around in slightly warm conditions, it quickly reeks of sweat. You feel comfortable and dry, but the smell is not good. So for any casual wear it isn't a great choice. A shame really."
2,shipping and handling 9.95,The item is fine but the shipping and handling cost was $9.95 for a $25 shirt! will not order from this vendor again :(
5,"Seems to work as well as the original, maybe better","I originally intended to purchase the OEM brand filter but the price difference (approx 3x the price) made me look at this one. It's a perfect fit, it seems to wick water well, and it has a metal mesh exterior that holds it's shape. If you are on the fence because this filter is not made by Essick or Kenmore don't be, this one works fine."
5,Perform like Kenmore original filters,I have used these EF-1 filters for several years. They perform just like the 2X more expensive Kenmore wick filters. Shipment arrived promptly and was reasonably priced...especially considering the free shipping.
2,Humidifier Filter,Somewhat difficult installing as the item arrived folded instead of rounded. After two weeks the humidifier would not function properly after it was cleaned. Had to turn the top of the filter down for the humidifier to run properly.Suggest placing the filter in a larger square box to ship.
2,Misleading!,"I am a Pilates instructor and dancer and bought this DVD for fresh ideas for class. There were none. Grace Lazenby's All the Right Moves had all this and then some, and she just used a pole for balance! This was not Ballet inspired even though she does use the word ""plie"". I bought the DVD after reading the bad reviews thinking how bad could it be? It was THAT bad, I wish I never bought it. I gave two stars because I have enough experience that I didn't have to follow along with a visual as much, as long as you pay extra attention to her verbal cues which are hard to understand, so I ended up getting a good thigh workout. Hmmm. maybe resell....?"
2,amateur production but a great instructor,It is a shame that the talented instructor made such a poorly put together DVD. It runs straight through probably shot with a fixed camera. The music is not only bad it is annoying and it would help if it were not there at all. The DVD does not even allow you to advance or go back to review which is important in an instructional film. The title is also misleading as much of this is not done with a barre. Cannot possibly recommend this DVD but I would recommmend the instructor if she is on more professional DVDs.
4,Seasoned Ballet DVD-er,"This is about my third ballet conditioning DVD and it's definitely the hardest. I'm determined to get through it though. She's no nonsense and I like to think I'm better than most instructors on workout DVD's, ha ha! Some of her instructions are a tad obscure and the production is bad at parts but I'm too busy focusing on the movement to really care! Not much ballet though so if you're looking for that element specifically, this isn't for you. If you're looking to look like a ballerina, give it a whirl."
4,Friendly Fitness Workout,"This is a great video for anyone who is a fan of the Lotte Berk Method. Although she calling it something else...in this DVD Carrie presents classic exercises in order. The 45 minute tape is challenging and effective. It does not include the round and flat back series. The only teeny tiny criticism is that the camera does not show the feet placement and with her black leotards on a dark background sometimes the positioning can get lost but she provides plenty of cues and instruction without being boring or pedantic. Her homespun Midwestern accent is a plus as is her broad smile and attitude. Of the three tapes she has put out this original one is still my favorite.Although I agree with other reviewers about the poor production quality, overall I enjoy using this DVD in rotation with my others. It is a nononsense workout that moves quickly and is effective."
2,"If you're gonna buy this DVD, read the reviews first!","I, on the other hand, failed to do so and was disappointed...It's not because it was too hard or too easy I just could not see what the hell she was doing! I mean really, black clothes and black shoes on a black floor in a dark room? Why did she bother? She should have saved her money and just made a cd explaining what each move was, because I spent most of my time struggling to figure out what she was doing. It doesn't help that I couldn't skip ahead or replay what she said/did, the dvd won't let you.If you have done Pure Barre before, I imagine you wont have a hard time keeping up. If you're a beginner, look else where.Sorry."
1,agree with the production,I would have to agree with the production. The black clothes and black background make it so VERY hard to see what she is doing the first time through.
3,Not for Those New to Barre,"I love barre workouts. I own a lot of DVDs devoted to this method and it's very effective, especially on the lower body. Like another reveiwer stated, the set and the production quality is bad. Really bad. It looks like something a high school AV Class threw together for a class project. The set is dark and ugly, the camera work is inadequate, cutting off body parts, and failing to show different angles to help with proper form. The instruction, is so-so, although I felt form pointers and modifications were a bit lacking.If you're looking for really good, thorough instruction and a little more refined production quality, check out Lotte Berk, or if you can get your hands on some Bar Method DVDs, definitely do that. This isn't a bad DVD for a first try, there is just lots of room for improvement."
4,my situation,"I listen to this song everyday faithfully. I can't get over the way the words fit the description of what many people are going through. I like the melody and the sound of Carl's voice. Smooth, yet relaxed."
3,Furguson (Hollywood),"A bit too commercial but there are a few cuts that make the grade. For your eyes only is nicely done and I enjoyed Stanley Clarke's bass play on Touch & Go, Average CD at best but this is not jazz."
3,No Sparkle Here,"I agree with the other reviewers, this album is filler for the CEO's. When you focus on making money, you're not making music and fans can tell - so what's the point - it's a waste and puts a blotch on your reputation which Maynard does not deserve. For Yor Eyes Only is certainly outstanding, but that stems largely from the original melody. Maynard does a fantastic job with this one and Hollywood is exciting and fun as well. The rest of this album is just not Maynard.Kevin BrettCEO, Kevin Brett Studios, Inc.Author: ""The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life""The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life!Producer of: The Art of Intelligent Driving (DVD)The Art of Intelligent Driving"
1,"Good hardware, difficult to cancel subscription","I was an XM customer for 4 yrs. I used this radio during that time and it works fine. However, I no longer listen to XM. I mostly bought it for a few specific stations and last year, those stations stopped being as good.You can manage your XM account online with one exception: You have to call to cancel your account, and you cannot call 24 hours a day; they have 9-5 Eastern business hours. Very inconvenient.When I complained to the customer service rep that they had charged me on a credit card number that they never had (the web account shows my old card #), she literally laughed at me and told me to take it up with Amex.Would you really want to buy a product from soneone who laughs at you when you have an issue?Just use Pandora and save yourself the aggravation."
2,"The Radio is fine, just nothing to listen to","From a technical standpoint, it's fine. It's when you get the service and the bitter realization that you have 200 stations of nothing, that's a problem. The reception is lost fairly easily (if it is cloudy or raining, it will make the reception spotty). What century are we in again? ""Hello, tech-support? Clouds have ruined my reception....what should I do? Ah, wait for the sun to come out, boy, were you helpful!' Installing it is pretty user friendly as well...and conversely, uninstalling it and cancelling your subscription to this wayyyy overrated service is even easier..satelite radio sucks hard. Listen your ipod, you're better off."
4,Cute Mini-Addition to a Le Creuset Collection,"Yes people, this pot is tiny. But, if you read the reviews then you shouldn't be surprised by its size when it arrives in the mail.This piece is cute and is perfect for serving warm dips with chips for informal entertaining, especially if you get a couple so you can put one next to a chip bowl in various parts of a family room (great for when the boys are piled in and watching games). I especially like this for warm dips as you can take advantage of the stoneware aspect by putting the piece in the oven to pre-heat it before you put your warm dip in it - definitely helps keeping the dip warm longer.It also could be a cute container for individual dessert servings like a creme brulee, cobblers, etc."
1,Bait and Switch,"What I know!!! The Amazon website said the size of the free blue oval was 2.5 quarts. It was a package deal that with my 5.5 quart creuset oven that reduced the cost and had free shipping. What I received, as the previous poster listed, was a 1/2 pint ""creuset"" oval oven. Totally useless!!! and the tag on the item in the box says it was made in Thailand. Le Creuset ovens are made in France. Is this thing even safe to eat out of (lead in the glaze, who knows!). It appears to me that AMAZON ripped me off. I recommend all Amazon users screen capture the ad at time of purchase. There does not appear to be anyway to challenge Amaozn on this. @$%^@$%^@$%^!!!"
4,Phenomenal Goat,"I was really pleased to find this long-time favorite. Billy, ever the adventurous, hungry goat hero, is up to his tricks in this book. A fun read."
3,Too long into book to get interesting.,"I love Susan King books, however, I have found that some are just too hard to wade through until they get interesting. I have waded though 1/2 of this book so far and still cannot get excited about reading the rest. I am just hoping that the other 1/2 will be worth it. I love books that start out with a bang that gets you so interested that you cannot put the book down, page by page they are just too interesting and lead you on until you are up until the wee hours of the night reading just to finish the book."
3,"Original, but marred by doom plot","This is a well-written, interesting novel, but I found it difficult to truly enjoy. The heroine spends much of the book pushing the hero away and predicting his doom, a great START to the novel, but it is carried on far too long and you never really feel the heady emotions that Susan King usually writes. The first sex scene feels contrived, and they all seem to degenerate into ""love metaphors"". King's Raven's Moon, Lady Miracle, and The Angel Knight are far superior."
3,Dico 541-782-4 Nyalox Flap Brush 4-Inch Orange 120,I was a bit disappointed as it didn't do what I expected. Would like it to be more agressive. It is very good as a polishing of the wood in tight areas and curves. It doesn't sand off lines. It is very durable and will try to find more uses for it.Thanks
4,quality chain,"I've worn this chain a couple of times, and it seems very well made. The only thing, which prob can't be helped,is that if you wear it without a charm the clasp slips down constantly. But like i said, it's well made and has the nautical feel i was looking for."
3,Somewhat shallow treatment,"I was hoping to encounter some examples I did not already know about. To a person uncertain on the subject, this volume can be helpful, but I was hoping to see more more firsthand historical sources quoted more extensively. His personal descriptions of his own travels seem full of his own interpretations of visual impressions and aren't too convincing as proof of fulfilled prophecies."
2,Made Eczema Flare Up!,I would caution those buying this product for an infant with ezcema. My daughter's ezcema flared up as soon as this product touched her skin. I ended up have to put steroids on her skin for two days to calm it down. The Aquaphor ointment is great but buyer beware with this baby wash. Buy a trial size or one bottle and make sure it won't irritate your baby's skin before you buy the three pack.
5,"Great product for dry, itchy skin.","I'm so happy to find this soap. So gentle and silky, easy to lather. My child has less eczema occuranses since I startet to use it in combination with baby Aquaphor healing ointment. I would recomend it to anybody."
5,Best wash for infants and children with eczema,"I used this wash when it first came out for my toddler with eczema. It worked well, but I thought we should use something that had a ""baby fragrance"" to it. Anyway, after trying all the washes with fragrance that claimed they were ""even for children with eczema"" we have gone back to the best wash for him. It is fragrance free, soap free, and keeps all of his rashes at bay. we now also use it for my 7 week old infant and it is wonderful!! Baby soft skin! :)"
2,Passable!,"I did not care for the singing (vocals). To say it was amateurish, would be too kind.This is nowhere near his masterpiece (Pancha Nadai Pallavi). There is a strong repetition of concepts (with appropriate transposition) from his earlier work."
5,best rock en espanol album,"this is unlike any other rock en espanol record i've heard. it doesn't tackle any areas previously touched by other spanish-speaking bands (funk/punk, ska, bolero mix, merenguerap)-- they are in fact influenced more by brits the cure than their latin counterparts. the monroy brothers explore the universe on this album--join them!"
4,True to it's roots,AMORRRRRRRRR METALLLLLLLLLlOne of the best local bandas from LA and one of the very few who haven't changed their style.
4,Long Time Gamer,"I enjoyed this game. It has good quests with some puzzle elements, some skill events that will take some practice, and pretty much free range exploring, with good camera control. Cute story."
4,Ratatouille,This is my sons best game. This is the second time Ive had to purchases this game as he just has to have it. The game came quickly and in perfect condition.
3,A fun game - but download a walkthru!,"UPDATE: Found a walk-thru on the internet that ""walks"" you thru all the levels. We finally finished the game, but there are still a handfull of trinkets we just couldn't find. Overall, my son loves the game now. If your child likes the movie, this game is good fun.>>The game, like the movie, is very cute - but the menus are tricky and the cheat codes I found, all but 2 don't work. The walkthru I found online was VERY helpful. Still, there are things we have never been able to find!"
4,what's new scooby doo vol.7,I'm sorry that it's been so long. I'm sorry about that my computer has been down. I really like this and so does my daughter.
2,"Only has 3,500 entries, and is over 10 years old.","I am a business translator, and have bought every English-Spanish dictionary published for almost 25 years now. This dictionary has only 3,500 entries, and was translated in 1997 from a 1995 German book. Hence, the book is not current, is very limited in scope, and worse of all, not even oriented towards English or Spanish.I gave it two stars because its sample sentences may be helpful for beginners. This book will be of no use to anyone of an intermediate of advanced level in either language. It is completely inadequate for business translators.I recommend your buying one or both of the following: Webster's New World English-Spanish/Spanish-English Business Dictionary, or The Oxford Spanish Business Dictionary. If you only need one, then buy Webster's New World English-Spanish/Spanish-English Business Dictionary. Do not buy Mastering Spanish Business Vocabulary : A Thematic Approach, unless you are aware of and accept these limitations."
4,Very Helpful,"This book has proven very benificial to me. I am in the process of moving to South America with my employer. I am a Human Resource Manager and this book has helped me greatly with my spanish buisness vocabulary. Another book that I have found to be even more indispensable for me and a definite ""5"" star is the book ""Spanish for Human Resources Managers."""
2,Does not explain concepts well,"I used this book for 2 semesters of introductory biology in college. After the first month, I became frustrated with the poor explanations. I asked a few friends and they recommended Biology by Campbell. What a lifesaver!I also continued to used this book and also found a number of errors in the pictures. This cost me a few points on tests and quizzes, so this added to my low opinion of this book. I also became hesitant to trust what it was telling me, particularly when there were differences between Campbell and this book.It has a nice layout, and it breaks topics into meaningful chunks; the explanations were okay most times and simply inadequate too frequently for me. On a scale of 1 to 10, this book is about a 3 or 4 and Campbell is a 9. But reading Campbell also takes more time and effort."
4,"Sex, Drugs and Dancehall?","Sizzla may be trying to walk in two different directions at the same time with this disc, but I would not call this aimless; he is not lost, he is just taking the long way around. Sizzla's young, succesessful and being followed by temptation everywhere. Parasites can smell the fresh blood. Everybody wants a piece of Sizzla. This should be listened to as a confession of sorts. Rich and Beautiful is as angry as it is humorous. I'm with the Girls? Exactly...."
3,Not the best mixed cd for Sizzla ... disappointed!,"Mixing on CD poor. Does not do justice to Sizzla's great voice and Jamaica's hard core dancehall and reggae beats! However, I am a lover of the music and the artiste ..... so still got to have it in my collection!"
2,Totally tossed off.,"This album just doesn't do it for me. Or maybe I should have said this ""album,"" because this barely feels like an album at all. It's basically a collection of singles, and most of them are pretty weak singles at that. I'm a fan of Sizzla and have most of his CDs and a lot of his singles, and when this dropped I took it as a bad sign that 1. I already owned a few of these songs, and 2. they weren't really favorites of mine. Sadly they turned out to be some of the best material here (like ""Run Out Pon Dem,"" which is not a great tune but is at least driving and catchy). The whole thing feels kind of slapdash and inconsistent, jumping between styles, sounds, and years like a coked-up frog. If you want a much better recent Sizzla album, pick up ""Waterhouse Redemption"" or ""Soul Deep,"" or even the disguised compilation ""Jah Protect"" which is a ripoff of a couple previous albums, but still features a lot of better material than this one."
4,Works well for me but the smell is pretty awful,"These pills really help me get into a deep sleep which I've lacked for many years. I find that these Valerian pills work in a similar manner as Gabapentin which I was previously prescribed by my Sleep Center physician. Like Gabapentin, the first couple of nights were filled with ultra-violent and disturbing nightmares but once my body got used to the pills they subsided.The only downside of these pills is the smell. They basically smell like a dirty unwashed crotch which is pretty hard to overcome. I take a couple other pills to help me sleep so I make sure to take these last and immediately brush my teeth."
1,not good,"hard too beleavt it doe any penefets at all,headack, stomochach and much more dont bay it ,dont waste your mony"
2,"These caplets smell absolutely AWFUL. But it does make you sleepy, I guess.","I could smell these pills before I opened the bottle. The scent is unlike anything familiar. It just plain stinks. I took 2 tablets with water and because they are practically weightless caplets, they are almost impossible to swallow. They stayed floating inside the back of my throat until I ate some bread to chase them down. And then I could taste/smell the stinky herbal smell from inside my esophagus!I woke up groggy and unrested, and now my whole bathroom smells weird like the pills do. Go for melatonin instead. I like that much better than this stuff."
1,Feel Ripped off,"On the front of the bottle it says 100 capsules ""certified 530mg"" In tiny tiny writing on the back of the bottle it tells you the dosage is 3 capsules.To me this is very misleading and manipulative. The bottle lasts only 1/3 as long as you would expect. It probably has something to do with why people feel it doesn't work.I will not buy any more of Nature's Way products."
3,Be Careful,"This probably works for more people- but for me Valerian has proved many times over to not work. Instead of calming me, it makes my heart race and gives me super crazy jitters. More like an energy rush when I'm trying to fall asleep! Be careful..."
5,The knock out punch I needed.,"I had dabbled with Valerian root a while back and when insomnia came calling again, I waited a little too long before I brought this back in my arsenal. This is the herb that tastes and smells like dog dirt, but will help you relax and get too sleep.It should be noted that this bottle recommends 3 tablets one hour before bedtime.I've been getting good results with just taking 2."
5,Relax and Sleep With No Side Effects,"I sometimes have trouble sleeping or have days where I feel nervous and just can't stay calm, but when I take Naturee's Way Valerian Root both problems are solved. Things that made me feel worried or nervous don't seem to bother me nearly as much and I can get to sleep with no trouble. It's a lot better than relying on drugs that can have side effects and do a lot more harm than good. Getting back to nature is the best way for me; I've purchased this more thanonce and intend to do so again."
3,Nature's way Valerian Root,This is something that my Dr had suggested I try to help me sleep. It was cheaper here than what I was paying at the store's. I can't say it helped me sleep any better and the smell is awful.
3,Only if you love dogos...,"We bought this movie because we have a dogo and think they're the most beautiful animals. The movie line was strange and I can't say we really liked it, but for the dog."
5,Come On Rain,Come on rain by karen hesse and pictures by Jon J muth. I think it is a very good book. Come On Rain has very beautiful pictures. I like the expresions that Karen Hesse gave like Jakie Joice has long stringbean legs.
3,Love the visuals,"This book has simply phenomenal illustrations -- from the grey, dusty, dry cityscapes at the beginning, to the gleeful postures and refreshed cool blue pavements at the end. You feel the longing for rain, the heavy potential for rain, the joy of rain. That's all excellent.We have too many books by and about African-Americans that feature free verse. The books are visually appealing and tell great stories, but they do our kids a disservice by not reinforcing standard English. Our kids must learn to use sentences, paragraphs, and proper English usage in order to succeed and win.Come on, publishers. Do us parents a favor and help us out."
5,What a great read!,"I love the illustrations that complement the text, and completely capture that hazzy summer heat.A longer picture book than most, Hesse really gives the feel of summer and that anxiousness when looking at those first storm clouds on the horizon! While at times I thought the text was a tad too artsy, that's really just my own personal taste.Overall a really great and unique book! Definitely recommended!"
5,"""Come On, Rain!"" A Truly Beautiful Book!","I found the book ""Come On, Rain!"" at our local library and immediately picked it up. The first thing you will notice about this beautiful book are the gorgeous ilustrations! The pictures in this book are lovely and the prose is so happy and full of the anticipation everyone feels on a hot summer day while waiting for a cooling rain. You and you children will love this book!"
3,Broken English,"I have noticed that many African American books, such as this one, have the feature of using broken english in their writings. As an African American mother and teacher I have a problem with this. While this may be the talk SOME African American children hear at home it does not speak to everyone nor it is a feature of our culture. This book did however met one of my hopes for black literature, it was a story with african americans that did not speak of racial pride or nappy hair.I would like to see more books with normal themes (family,weather, good behavior etc)because being black does not stop at or only include broken english, black pride, dark skin and nappy hair."
5,Excellent guide to Dickinson's work,"Lundin's book offers insightful analysis of the spiritual dimensions of Dickinson's poetry. Both the poetry and this analysis can be challenging, but the book is absorbing, generally accessible and rewarding, a valuable contribution to my understanding of this poet and the historical/ theological/ biographical context for her art."
4,The Best of the sequels,"The original Jaws was a huge succees so there's no wonder they made a sequel. It's bad enough they had to make one sequel but 3 was just a mistake, Jaws: The Revenge is huge proof of that. It's silly enough that another huge shark just happens to come back to the same beach and no one believes Roy Scheider all over again. However Roy Scheider is the reason this film is good, he manages to hold the film without Robert Shaw ""for a good reason...his character was eaten in the original"" and Richard Dryfus.Although Scheider is solid, the teenagers who get attacked by Jaws at the end are awful, you got really bad Friday the 13th caliber acting there. With that aside Jaws 2 is still a good movie, sort of an unneeded sequel but there's still chills and thrills. Certainly the only Jaws sequel worth owning."
2,"This movie is sequel, can you tell!- Jimmy D.","this movie was worse than the other 2 but better than the revenge the directors didn't do that great of a job with jaws 2 they didn't have a very appealing plot and I thought tht JAWS 2 Was pointless!The actors look bored, you'll be bored. I give it 2 Stars END"
3,The Other White Meat,"Not as good as the first one, but worth watching. I am starting to root for the shark."
3,Not as good as the original.,"Jaws two is ok, just not great.The shark is still cool, but it's basically the first movie remade poorly.The script is ok, the acting is ok.All in all it's not a must see.If you liked one, you may want to rent this one."
3,Not as Good as the Original!!!,"This sequel is nowhere near as good as the original. Most of the characters returned, but it just doesn't have the spirit of the original classic. Four years after Chief Brody killed the Great White Shark, another one returns to Amity. Brody's kids and their friends all go sailing and are attacked by the shark. Will Brody stop it in time? You might like JAWS 2!!!"
3,"You can't beat the original, but the follow-up is a fun ride","The first Jaws film can't be outdone. But, of the hundreds of movie sequels I've seen, none quite match their original. That's the case with Jaws 2. This said, it's best to approach the movie with a mind open to a fresh story. Jaws 2 is a follow-up that stands up well on its own, even if you didn't see the first film. It doesn't try to outdo nor ""water"" down the original. Instead, a new storyline set years later brings a fresh slant on the underwater terror the first movie brought to the big screen. Watching the first film is a must, but I wasn't disappointed with the second installment. In fact, I enjoyed the fact that more characters were featured, suspense was solid and terror was real. If you enjoyed Jaws, you'll like Jaws 2."
4,A good sequel,"While not as thrilling or well written as the first film, this movie is still very good. Roy Scheider is back as Brody and does as fantastic a job as ever. The action in this film is about as intense as the first film, but it always seems rushed or jumbled to me and not quite as thrilling. If you like Jaws you should watch this movie too. You want be disappointed"
3,A Fair Sequel,"The opening is superb to this film. Finding the Orca on the ocean bottom is intriguing and mysterious; the shark attack somewhat predictable. Scheider's performance is great as the water fearing island police chief, deeply affected by the first shark. The shark scenes are great, but the island scenes are somewhat overdone; including Brody's problem with no one beleiving him, and the teenage sailing scenes. Overall a good sequel, much better than Jaws 4."
3,A very good sequel,"Jaws2 is one of the best sequel's I have ever scene,there is a lot of scene's in this movie that kept me on the edge of my seat,it is of course not as good as the first film,and it would of been nice if Richard Dreyfuss came back for the second film,but other then that small complaint I liked Jaws2.P.S. I even liked part 3"
3,Just when you thought it was safe....Jeannot Szwarc's Jaws 2,"This is the only good sequel in the Jaws series. It is four years later and a girl is attacked on a boat that explodes. Cheif Martin Brody(Roy Scheider) once again becomes curious. Later, he finds an attacked whale and a woman's corpse. When the Mayor(Murray Hamilton) denies it, Brody is fired. The next day, Brody's two sons Mike and Sean, sneak out to go sailing with their friends. To help them, Brody gets on a Police Boat to rescue them. Then the teeens are attacked and it's up to Brody to save them..... You don't have to watch Jaws 3 and Jaws: The Revenge."
4,The lunch buffett is still open!,"As the original JAWS is my all time favorite film, JAWS II finds it's way in to my top 10. Why you ask, well I will tell you why. In this just as trilling sequal. Chief Brody(Roy Scheider) finds himself confronting another huge great white shark(the word got around that this place serves a mean human ala king!)set 3 years after the fisrt shark attacks, the town of Amity wishes to forget and pass on the possibility of another great white shark. So Brody is on his own this time to do battle not just with the shark but his own fears to save a group of day sailers which includes his sons Micheal and Sean from becoming a gourmet feast!"

So Brody is on his own this time to do battle not just with the shark but his own fears to save a group of day sailers which includes his sons Micheal and Sean from becoming a gourmet feast!"
4,What was the previous reveiwer stoned on!,"This is as good a sequel as there has ever been.It must have been a nightmare to try and recapture the brilliance of the orginal but i think Jeannot has done a great job.Good action sequences make this a real thrill ride.The dvd has loads of extras and despite the previous reviewers reservations,the making of Jaws 2 documentary(45 minutes not 10)is well worth waching.the 2 trailers remind us of the great hype about the release and the deleted scenes are far better than the ones axed from Jaws.A must for fans of the genre!"
4,4 out of 5 dentists recommend Jaws 2,"This sequel still intimidates - still frightens. The real bonus is that Roy Scheider came back for this one. Whenever original characters come back - it adds to the plot continuity and the fun.Really, Jaws and Jaws 2 are enough. You start to wonder, at this point, why even go near the water?"
3,Pretty decent follow-up to the original,"The first, and really the only good, sequel to the classic original, ""Jaws 2"" finds a Great White menace once again lurking off the coast of Amity Island. Roy Scheider ably reprises his role as Cheif Brody, who remembers the warning signs from his first encounter with a big shark and tries to convince the town council of the danger.This film has a decent script and decent acting. Yes, Richard Dreyfuss is missed, but this movie holds its own. The only drawbacks are that the mechanical shark used in the film looks obviously artificial. The other is that the element of suspence that kept you on your toes in the original is lacking here. You know when the shark is going to strike.That said, there are plenty of good moments in this film, and makes for an enjoyable view."
2,THIS SHARK HAS NO BITE,"In retrospect, it's more than likely that JAWS should not have had any sequels. The three followups pale in comparison and offered nothing new. Without Steven Spielberg, Richard Dreyfuss or Robert Shaw, this second JAWS is lacklusterly directed by Jeannot Szwarc, a Frenchman who should stick with low key films like his SOMEWHERE IN TIME or his stints on the NIGHT GALLERY tv series. His pace is so languid, there is little suspense generated. It doesn't help that too much time is focused on a bunch of teenagers who are merely whiny and plot devices. Roy Scheider tries gamely to recreate the passion of his original role, but even he seems tired and bored with the whole thing. Even John Williams score is uninspired and redundant. If you like shark attack movies, you may be able to tolerate this...just don't think it's as good as JAWS."
3,I have a secret,"To make Jaws 2 a really good movie, you must do what I did. First I Tivo'ed it. Then I recorded it onto a VHS tape. I took out all the commercials and all the scenes with the no talent teens. Also, I drastically edited the boring city council scenes and all the boring slow moving underwater scuba stuff. I cut this sucker down to 1 1/2 hours and it rocks. This is what I do when I am real bored and have some time on my hands. Give old movies my own edit. My kids love this one now."
3,Jaws 2,"This is on okay movie, it could have been betterRead my reviews Halloween Halloween II Halloween 4 Halloween 5 Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers and Halloween H20 and Jaws 3 and Jaws The RevengeThanks"
1,"""this movie stinks''","this is a bad movie i saw Jaws,Jaws2,and Jaws3-d and Jaws 2 is the worst check out jaws 3-d now that one is good."
5,Still fun,"I agree that had there been no Jaws, this movie would have been better received. It is not a bad movie, but never stood a chance in the shadow of its big brother. I enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone."
4,where were the toothpicks?,still a seat of the pants movie after all this time --- well done. Action was believable and the subconscious mind set of the characters was dune subtly.
2,Not the best of the quadrilogy,"While Jaws is a classic monster / horror movie, its sequel is not the best. While it was good to see Roy Sheider as Sheriff Brody again, he seems to be phoning it in half the time. Out of the 4 Jaws movie this one is my least favorite because it seems almost like the first movie never took place. The town's leaders have the same reaction as in part one: denial, etc. Till the shark almost has to swim up, say hello, and bite someone publicly before these guys will do anything. But you also have to take it as what its meant to be, a sequel to a shark movie. I would recommend this one only for completionists as Jaws 3 and 4 are way better, but of course nothing comes close to the original."
4,Excellent sequel to Jaws!,"Jaws 2 is a very good sequel. Roy Scheider is once again in top form as Chief Brody. Jaws 2 is no match for Jaws but still very fun and exciting. I like the shots form Martha's Vineyard because I've been to most of the places in this film. High Points: Roy Schieder, the shark, good action, the relived Jaws score once again scored agin by John Williams. Low points: the abscence of Richard Dreyfous and Robert Shaw"
2,Upside down & floating...,"Sequels for the most part suck. No exception here. Want a sequel? Try Star Wars, Indiana Jones, or even the Terminator. The big fat shark should have eaten the whole town and left nothing for a part 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7..... etc. Stinko!"
5,The best sequel ever!,Just like the first Jaws 2 was wondeful.The best sequel I have ever wached. A greit whait shark intrudes a small town called Amity again. So it wasnt a Steven Spielberg film. How cares it was a great moive.
4,Jaws2,"This was a good movie. I didn't understand how the shark could sink a helicopter and chase down a water skier. I thought this movie could have been better if Richard Drayfuss had been in it. I didn't like the kids go crazy when they ran aground. That part was pointless. They could have made the water redder when the shark killed and when he was killed. These were only suggestions, not complaints. Once again, it was a good movie."
3,"Not as good as the first, but fun to watch.","As one reviewer pointed out, the film itself may not be the greatest, but there sure are a lot of extra features. The one I found to be the most interesting was the potrait of actor Keith Gordon.While watching the film I realized that he looked familiar.Gordon went on to star in two classic 80's films Christine and Back To School. Go grab this one now before it gets deleted. I had somewhat of a hard time finding a copy."
3,Jaws 2,"Jeannot Szwarc's mecenary sequel is nowhere as good as Spielberg's original, but with such a high platform to go from, it's actually quite impressive. Roy Scheider returns as Cheif Brody and Murray Hamilton as the mayor for continuity, but Scheider dosn't bring the same strong emotions as the first, and it seems like everyone's just going through the motions. John William's memorable score is put through the re-tread, but still works well. Alike to James Cameron's Aliens, the monster is brought out of the shadows to terrifying effect, as we see the shark in full light. But the problem is, in the first one, there was a great ensamble cast of characters we liked and cared about, in this one, we couldn't care less, as a couple of boorish teenagers get picked off, and while the attacks are gruesome, they don't pack the same effect. Under a steadier hand, this might have been more enjoyable. But it's a lot better than the truly awful Jaws 3 and 4."
5,Jaws2,No need for long flowing words. This is a great item and was what we wanted. Arrival on time in great condition. Don
3,Just A Knock Off,"Good acting performances all around combined with great action and suspense are enough to keep Jaws 2 from sinking. While undoubtably just a knock off from its stellar predecessor, Jaws 2 is still a good film and is highly undderated from the mainstream critics, but as stated before, it is still just a knock off from the first film. That, however, is not nessecarily a bad thing."
4,Followup to Jaws,Jaws II will never be as good as the original but Jaws II brings you the same characters as in the first one like Chief Brody who isn't in the other Jaws' movies
3,Not as good as original,"When Jaws came out it was a MAJOR box office hit. It scared the pants off a lot of people too!! Jaws passed the $1,000,000 mark also!. after the movie was made critics demanded a Sequel to jaws. the directors decided they wanted to go back to ""Badluck prone"" town of amity. so here we go again, another killer shark invades the towns waters causing complete havoc. I mean what are the chances? chief brody goes out to find the shark that is tormenting some teens(micheal and Sean brody included). after he finds the teens he fries the shark with an electric pole he found in the water. this was not a masterpiece but it deserves some credit. we were all hoping for another jaws but not one like this. I liked the fact that it was based in Amity and Chief brody. i gave this film three stars.i hope you found this helpful please visit my home page."
3,Okay Sequel,"Jaws 2 is the only one of the three sequels worth looking at. It has it's flaws, mainly in repeating most of the moments from its magnificent predecessor and also the absence of Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and director Spielberg hurts. But at least it manages to retain the form, if not the substance of the original and that's something neither of the horrid films that followed did."
4,Jaws 2,"Pretty good on the edge of your seat movie, would love to see a more modern version made. For it's time this is very believable"
5,"""AN o.k. seaquel""","""Jaws2"" is an o.k. sequel to the classic ""Jaws"".It doesn't have as much excitement or impact on the audience.But at the end, it ends up being a good sequel.{the shark gets killed again.}"
3,"Not the original, but fun...","This is worth seeing just to see how they get rid of the shark this time. You will probably spend some of your time yelling at the screen, saying things like: ""Get out of the water you morons!""Oh well. It was fun, as I said. I actually bought this for my father, who is re-building an old lobster boat and wanted to use the boat in this movie as a guide. Heh!"
3,O.k. sequel,It was an o.k. follow up to the original. It reminds me of siblings that want to be with the older ones and how the older ones want their independence.
1,HORRIBLE,this movie sucks! it is soooooooo boring and practically no one gets eaten and how they kill the shark is so un real. just stick to jaws
1,Total Crap,"I see everybody else liked it, but I didn't enjoy it at all. It ruined the first one, and was very similar, but very different. I probably would've preferred it if Speilburg made it, but he didn't. The first one, to me, was totally ruined. I'm sorry if you disagree with me, it's only my opinion."
3,Jaws 2: An Okay Sequel,"It was inevitable that after the success of ""Jaws"", there would be a sequel. However, producers Zanuck and Brown didn't have a lot of faith in this film, predicting that it would gross only about one third of the first film's profits. Their attitude reflects the mediocrity that is ""Jaws 2."" Screenwriters Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler merely rehashed many scenes from the original without creating an original story.The mechanical shark looks even more mechanical in ""Jaws 2,"" and director Jeannot Swarc's insistance on showing the shark more frequently on screen actually induced laughter in some audiences.With all its weaknesses, ""Jaws 2"" is still worth a look, especially for avid ""Jaws"" fans. Roy Scheider is excellent as Chief Brody, who has become a bit paranoid after his earlier showdown with a Great White. There are also some suspenseful scenes and John Williams's unforgettable score is still intact."
3,Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water....,"Once again the peaceful island resort of Amity is terrorized by another great white shark, hell bent on munching up water skiers and taking apart dim witted sailors.This movie is okay. It's not as good as the first, but its good to watch and its worth it. The shark looks even crudder than first, taking up the position of old ""scar face!"". It looks like cheap stuff, but it has some good effects, and I like the shark footage.It's worth seeing, but if you didn't rate the first one (you would be mad if you didn't) dont bother seeing this one."
2,Why do they keep doing this to us?,"In a nutshell, this is a pretty decent movie. It is definitely a cut above many sequels. What kills this DVD presentation though it the ""Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono"" sound. Come on now...Jaws was released last year in a DTS presentation, and this movie is more recent than the first. Why are we being forced to tolerate MONO here? Do the movie companies think we don't know or don't care? I sure know that this movie sounded like crap compared to the DTS presentation of the first one. I am going to sell my copy of this DVD and wait for it to be released correctly so that I can enjoy it. If you're watching this movie on a TV with no sound system, you'll be fine, but if you appreciate home theatre, be prepared to be let down by this sound."
3,Jaws 2 = Good film!,"OK, I can see that some people have problems with all of the Jaws sequels. But leave Jaws: The Revenge alone. It wasn't that bad and it was nice to see Loraine Gary reprising her role as Ellen Brody. As for Jaws 2: I liked it. Chief Brody was back, and he did an outstanding job. I thought the scene where the shark rips through the bottom of the boat was really scary! And watching the teens was a lot of fun. Especially watching Jackie (Donna Wilkes) go into shock after watching that one girl get eaten whole. I found that entertaining. The ending was good. If you haven't seen this movie, get it! It's a lot of fun!"
3,Undeniably the only good Jaws sequel.,"Simply stated, Jaws 2 is the only good Jaws sequel. The acting is much better than Jaws 3 and Jaws The Repulsive, er Jaws The Revenge. Its really nice to see Amity again. There are plenty of thrills and chills. John William's last Jaws score is very good. The main problem is that the climax is weak and some of the teenagers are a bit iritating. Although Jaws is much better, I enjoyed Roy Shieder's more commanding performance in Jaws 2 than his performance in Jaws. The sheriff's sons take on a much bigger role here than in Jaws. They are prominentely featured in the next 2 Jaws sequels. Mark Gruner(Mike) and Marc Gilpin(Sean), who play the sons in Jaws 2, are probably the best Michael and Sean."

3,The First Jaws sequel is the best of the sequels. Solid film,Jaws 2 is a fine sequel. It can't compare to Jaws but it is a very enjoyable film that is helped by fine acting and a classy score.
3,Not the original,I remembered Jaws 2 slightly more exciting. I own Jaws 1 and watch it every year. It never grows old. We love it and it remains my favorite movie. As for Jaws 2 well...I fell asleep.
2,SOUPcans to NUTS on Warhol's world.,"Summer of 1973 I was ""dragged"" to see Andy Warhol's ""TRASH"" movie that started at midnight up in The Sullivan County Catskill Mountains in the village of Monticello. I left speechless and sorry that I lost my sleep. Though I remembered the name of Joe D'Alessandro, as my Mother's friend was married to someone by that name, I remember it to this very day. When this book came through my hands in the library, I thought I had nothing to loose during my lunch hour by reading it and it was a worthwhile read.After completing it, I had a different perspective on the artist and the man. I only equated him to ""Truman Capote"" and that ilk (and groupy ""wanna-be"" personalities) and only heard comments from others that were derogatory. THE FACTORY was always in the paper ""in the day"" and I was not impressed. ""Do not judge a book by its cover"" nor listen to others, read this to form your own educated opinion."
2,"good concert, but lacks extras","This dvd really feels rushed. The only extra on it is 'behind the scars', which is the same thing from scars of the crucifix. At the very end, the show a message of how the hoffmans left the band just days before this was filmed and jack and tony filled in, learning these songs overnight. All they do in this concert is just stand. Couldnt they have had the new lineup(the concert was 1.5 years ago)? Maybe an interview/fan stuff?"
3,Great Concert thats it!!,"Im a huge Deicide fan, so when I heard they were going to come out with a dvd I couldn't wait. Then it came out yesturday and I bought it! Let me tell you the show is sick amazing performance by those guys. Reminds me of when I saw them mouths back. Glen is pretty much drunk even before the band starts there set its amazing...lol Anyway, the Behind the Scars is the same exact thing as the DVD thats came with Scars From The Crucifix album. they could have done a much better job with this dvd but Im still a huge fan, but i just cant recommend this to really anyone. Only for The Live Concert! DEICIDE"
4,And that's the way it should be / Why only 4 Stars?,"A strait concert with no filler, the best thing that there is.// Why only 4 Stars? = Because I know they are a (speed)metal band but I saw the religious references snd I am non-religious because I'm AGNOSTIC And don't like religion because religion will not save you.""God is an invisble spirit that cannot be seen by human eyes"". = Jesus Christ said this - YOU are human so you cannot see him/it/whatever it is?""All the people that teach in the synagogues (modern day churches) and on the streets are hypocrites"".Jesus was killed by the Romans because he was a radical jew(?) on a medieval torture device called a cross in modern day times.[...]"
3,Not a well made book...,"The text is nice enough but I guess you get what you pay for and there is no way the books ultra cheep constructions gets you through its 1120 pages... just like the other two Oxford World Press books I ordered with this one. Really, $0.08 more a book to put a sturdy cover on it please?!?!?"
5,Simply Amazing,"This book is the definative collection of Byron works. It is simply amazing, and is composed beautifully. I would recomend it to anyone looking to learn about the amazing life and work of George Gordon, Lord Byron"
2,Disappointing use of the Jeopardy name,"This handheld game has the potential to be a fun yet educational toy for young minds but instead, it processes Jeopardy ""answers"" in a scroll pattern that moves quite slowly and also provides the ""questions"" by scroll with multiple choice selections. The device operates off of two AA batteries that are secured on the backside beneath a screwed cover that takes an eyeglass screwdriver to access. I think having the screw cover is a great idea with kids but wish the screw was a larger size so time isn't lost picking up the smaller tool. The anticipation was great for the toy to entertain on road trips but the toy just didn't measure up to the Jeopardy name."
3,Zinc dust,"Zinc picolinate is a highly absorbable form of zinc and that is good. My main complaint with these pills is that they were ""crumbly"". So they were all covered with a fine dust and this made them, sometimes, hard to swallow. Maybe not every bottle is like this but mine was."
5,Excellent Read,I was completely engulfed by this book. I read it very quickly because you truly do not want to put it down. To think that some of this book is based on actual events is pretty heartbreaking. Good prevails as it should though... I wish I could find more books like this to read....I simply loved it!!
1,Poorly edited,"I tried to read this book, as it was suggested to me by a friend. I couldn't get past the horrid punctuation, though. There were apostrophe atrocities, an obvious lack of knowledge regarding punctuation of dialogue, and other issues that I just couldn't overlook."
1,highly disappointed,"bought this car seat because of the simpson racing name and reputation. very very disappointed. paid for the name and not safety. under the cover is nothing other than a graco car seat. it is not even made by simpson, it just has the name on it. the car seat sucks. can't get it to tighten on my son! i do not feel he is safe in the seat and am going to purchase another evenflo symphony like i should have done in the first place. cheap cheap cheap. do not recommend this seat at all!"
2,Grayco with a racy cover,"We thought this would be a better seat since it has the Simpson name... but we've had a good amount of difficulty with the straps and the release button. We thought it would be a fun seat for daddy's truck. Maybe it will be better when our 2 year-old is bigger, but it's not our favorite seat."
4,Please Don't Tell Me,"I liked this book because it wasn't some ""music historian"" who read some books or saw some concerts, giving his bias opinion. It was the real artists telling it the way it was. But at the same time, it seemed like a lot of information. Almost too much. Instead of flattering the muscians and displaying their talents, this book showed them as sick junkies who beat their girlfriends and threw up on their crowd. But it is the truth, which I appreciated and was intrigued by. It sure took away the glamour and rock n roll sheen, though."
3,get the other one,great and fascinating book but get the other version. the only difference is a epilogue in the back where jerry nolan describes seeing elvis when he was a kid. it isn't much but it was my favorite moment in the book and this version is missing it.
3,This was satisfactory for a semi-mainstream attempt.,"Okay, I have to give it to you: it is HARD to document the history of punk, since punk is such a broad term these days. This book didn't really cover enough of the whole punk scene, it only concentrated on specific parts. If you want to learn about punk, you should concentrate on the politics and social aspects of it, not the purely musical element. Don't laugh... I think 1984 by George Orwell is a must-read for all punks. It is a perfect example of how the things we take for granted, like independent thought, can be taken away by an oppressive government. A government with too much power controls the past, and therefore controls the future. For more recommended punk reading, email me."
3,"Good, but not comprehensive","Pretty good book, but unfortunately not really the complete history of punk rock. It concentrates almost entirely on New York City in the early-to-mid 70s. I suppose the authors included what they know and like, but I wish there was more coverage of English punk rock."
4,An In Depth Look At The Punk Movement,"This book is incredible. You get to witness a movement from its birth to its near-death and everything in between. This book takes you on a journey, introducing you to bands and people such as the Velvet Underground, NC5, Nico, Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith, the Heartbreakers and the Ramones. You almost feel as if you're there in some parts. This book is very offensive in some parts, so if you're easily offended I wouldn't really recommend it.Overall this is a great read, for fans of punk and even none fans... it will introduce you to a world that you would have never seen otherwise. And that is the true purpose of a great book."
3,Pretty Good Book,"This topic is dear to my heart and I must say that I was truly engrossed in it from start to finish. If you like punk rock, this is a must read."
5,Please Kill Me,"Please Kill Me was a great read. entertaining, fun, and kinda scary. historic in scope and the 'the tale tells all' style reporting. hard to pit down as the next page is sure to yeild another storied gem."
5,...a vast and great history...,"PLEASE KILL ME - something from a t-shirt of the day: Imagine walking around a pre-gentrification Manhattan in this? PLEASE KILL ME - an oral history of punk as it evolved in NYC (one of its' real points of origin, along with Detroit) was a long time in the making, and was ultimately well worth the wait.This book is drawn from interviews with all of the key players, and the avalanche of historical detail presented here is far greater than anyone could've hoped for - to say that this book rewards re-reads would be a great understatement. There's years of material for further exploration on offer here.The nearly apocalyptic debauchery of the years is luridly detailed, but so also is the creative process and the working methods, and the diversity of the initial scene (something that unfortunately faded from punk into the 1980s) is also vividly depicted.A great and rich read.-David Alston"
3,good hard look at punk,"but an even better book is ""High On Rebellion Inside The Underground at Max's Kansas City"" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders, Psychotic Frogs,Jayne County,Cherry Vanilla, etc. THE REAL SCENE! YEAH!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I read this book in one sitting, not because it was good, but because there is so little in it. There is no insight to the man, only a smattering of personal details. Did contain a lot of photos and which made it more of a scrapbook than anything else. Nothing new at all."
5,"Bob and Richard, What a Combo","Boy, this is the best of the Hope books, and I've read them all. The photos are amazing and the book is a virtual encylopedia of information on one of America's best entertainers, the unselfish traveler who enterained our troops in every war since WW2. If you like Bob Hope, get this book and you will get to know Leslie Townes Hope as well as I do. Five Stars for this one. Honest."
3,"Funny, but not the whole HBO show!","I've been searching for YEARS for this HBO comedy special from 1986. I thought this was it... and it is, but only PART of it. Bob Nelson's football routine from 1986 was the funniest comedy ever. IT'S NOT ON HERE. Only the Jiffy Jeff boxing part is included. It's still funny, but it's not the football routine. Also, the Sam Kinneson part is funny but it's not the one I was looking for either. I'm pretty bummed."
2,nuevo no tan nuevo,"El libro lo he comprado ""nuevo"", pero tiene manchas en la tapa y me llego con la parte de atras danada. El envio del libro sinceramente fue muy rapido, pero las condiciones del libro no tan buenas."
3,"Short And Sweet, But Not The Best","Stark takes on the whole legal writing proces in a breezy style. Stark was a litigator once, and it shows. But that was years ago, and I think you can tell. In contrast, I liked Bryan Garner's ""The Winning Brief"" a lot more, in part because Garner gives real-world examples of what to do and what not to do. Stark tells more than shows. As a litigator myself, I find it more useful if an author shows me an example of what not to do and how to correct it. I gave it three stars.This book is very useful if you are a law student or a young lawyer. It gives simple rules and is easy to read. Some of his advice should be taken with a grain of salt. For example, he believes that briefs should not be written by several lawyers--but most young lawyers have little choice in that regard. Also, Garner's book (which is much longer and more detailed) gives much more advanced techniques. Overall, it is a very solid and readable resource for legal writers. It just is not the last word."
5,The Most Beautiful Music I Have Ever Heard,"Well, I finally refound Adina Sara. I first heard her music at various clubs throughout the Bay Area, and I fell in love with her voice, and even more so with her lyric abilities. Adina's songs tell universal stories of love, loss, gratitude. Self taught, her natural melodies will carry you right along, while her lyrics will wash over you and fill you with ripples of emotion you thought were long gone. Buy this album, play it for mood, it will light a candle in your soul and illuminate your world."
3,Enjoyable Reading,"Here is a somewhat fanciful look at the life of Warren Nelson. Mr. Nelson had a superb career in the Nevada gaming industry, and his life story is fun, easy reading. His account of his experiences as a partner at the Club Cal Neva and Palace Club are good reading."
2,Not a good rasp,"I have been happily using a great Diamond nipper for a few years, but this Diamond rasp is not very good. It just doesn't have enough bite and rasps like one of my well worn FD Dick rasps when it needs to be replaced. Even the file is disappointing. Did someone clean up an old rasp and resell it? Do not recommend."
4,Price is right,"These were inexpensive and defidently better quality than other headboards I've seen in the price range. I bought two for my sons, defidently something they will have through high school and take with them to college."
4,Perfect for the extra bedroom,This product was of good quality and easy to put together and a reasonable price. It was perfect for our extra bedroom. I would recommend this product.
4,Lakehouse,"We purchased this item for one of our spare bedrooms at our new home and we're very pleased with the quality. After looking in stores, this was a much sturdier and better built headboard for a better price. We would recommend to anyone."
2,lexmark 3200,"i have had this printer for 4yrs and it has finally died. i had the same problems as another review --- always jamming, taking a pad of paper and not one at a time, the ink cartridges went fast and are expensive to replace,and right now it has a chainsaw sound to it. and for the cost of the printer it isn't worth fixing and getting new ink.its done and now i must move on........"
5,Stanford Wong Flunks Big-Time,"I am a huge fan of Lisa Yee's first book, Millicent Min, Girl Genius. Now I'm crazy for Stanford Wong Flunks Big-Time! Let me tell ya, Lisa has a brilliant sense of humor, and her characters are so real, so vivid. My twelve-year-old son, who claims to not like reading, is now gobbling this book up! I do hope there are many more Lisa Yee books to come!"
2,"6 hours of talk, 20 minutes of substance","I wish somebody had warned me, the way I am warning you.DO NOT BUY THIS. Try and get it from a library. Or borrow it. You may or may not find it worth watching, but it is certainly not worth owning. You will never watch it again.I agree with his approach. But that's not the point. I bought the DVD not to be sold on the approach but to get specific techniques and practical steps. I am not exaggerating when I say that the hands-on advice runs 20 minutes. The rest is filler.For 6 hours.At least I didn't attend a seminar where I actually had to sit there and listen to him.I bet there's nothing here that isn't covered in the book. And a lot cheaper."
4,I Liked It!!,"I enjoyed Torque, it has globs of action like Fast and Furious.Its about a guys has this other guy's equipment and he tells him he cant give it to him at the moment, so they framed him by killing one of his rival's brother by killing him and telling the cops it was him, until the guy finds out and he goes after him in this wild ride that is fun to watch."
2,Sexy men,"yes this is not the best movie ever made but it is fun for me and my girlfriends to sit and eat popcorn, hoot at the acting and oogle cute guys. Our latest crush is Will Yun Lee and the scene of him barely covered by a sheet is worth sitting through the rest of the movie. Ladies check him out!!"
1,Absolutely the Worst Movie,"This was not only the worst remake , but the dumbest. How do you actually concieve making a remake of a remake? Not just that but a remake of a horrible remake. This is the utmost revolting movie ever, cheesy lines, bad acting,and a rediculous plot. I remember when i saw this movie, my jaw literally dropped, i didnt believe something this bad not only was made, but actualy put in theaters and now video?? This movie is so bad, i wouldn't even suggest it as a gag gift. I wouldn't buy this movie even to torture someone. The Fast and The Furious was was a good movie, and if speede and reving engines is what you want then go there."
2,I wouldn't watch it again.,"I didn't have high expectations from a this movie from the start but it was far worse than I ever thought it could be. Most of the stunts are completely rediculous. I've never heard of people ""bunny hopping"" a 450 lb. crotch rocket 10 feet in the air or fist fighting on two bikes weaving through traffic at what appears to be warp speed (whatever that is). The only reason I would watch it again would be if I'm drunk and want to pass out."
2,What Was I Thinking ?,"Ice Cube is one of the greatest rappers of all-time. ""Torque"" continues the string of cinematic evidence that he shouldn't give up his day job.Great cinematography and incredible bikes!"
3,Torque is what the real power is all about !!!,The movie was indeed alright I mean it opens out very cool with 2 imports car duking it out but overal the action was good but the plot was horriable.I see these plots over and over again you know what i mean ex Fast And Furious.The action was good it keeps you at your heels at all time and the acting was ok im not trying to downright there acting ability.But overal the movie was good to watch I think Biker boyzs was indeed bettter but its still a good flick to watch.
1,Written by my 3 year old neice,"This movie was horrible, even you don't care about plots and writting. I'd rather watch a Yukon lesgislation program."
1,Another Rip Off,"It's the same as The Fast and the Furious, Biker Boyz, etc. But on top of that, this one is full of cheese. They stopped making those types of movies over 10 years ago. It is almost embarassing to watch it. One of the worst movies out there. Hollywood cannot diliver good action anymore. This is a complete waste of money."
3,TORQUED-OFF !!,"This movie has plenty of entertainment to go around. The acting is passable and the cast are all generally likable. The story has your usual pseudo good guys and your over-the-top bad guys which is all sort of expected in this sort of movie. In fact, anyone who likes action movies in general should find this very appealing. What is annoying though is all the negative reviews posted here--all are way off base and just plain wrong. After all, action pics are rarely cinematic gems but when done well will deliver just what you are looking for and that's what TORQUE does---delivers the goods !"
1,A joke of a movie.,"From the opening scene, where Ford says he's running a 'two for one special' i knew this was going to be a bad B grade movie... and it was.The action in this movie was very mildly entertaining and thats not saying much considering its a pure action flick.The story was a mess, especially those two FBI agents. I guess the US government hires FBI agents off of MTV now...And the dialogue in this movie was atrocious. Many of the lines have you laughing at them, not with them.Also, that girl vs girl scene or should i say Pepsi vs Mountain Dew was the biggest blatant advertising ever in a movie. Its truly laughable.Since i have to give the movie at least one star i will give that star to Jaime Pressley because she looks real good in this movie. Thats all."
4,.,"If you like the ""Fast and Furious"" series for cars, this is the equivivant high octane adrenaline pumping action movie but made for motorcycles and not just ANY cycles and drivers. This is a must see for a cycle lover."
1,Send in the next hard a**,"honestly, this movie was garbage. i thought the stunts would make up for its lack of plot, and it would have if they were logical and real looking. i couldn't even sit through all of this, i quit half way, it was just too dumb. every single character was a hard ass, and every scene had a new hard ass. Every line is delivered in that hard guy, rough low tone. Biggest shock, Ice Cube plays, you'll never guess...the tough black guy. I know, mindblowing. It's pretty stupid when some guy is in the middle of the desert and someone sneaks up on him, on a bike. I'm no bike expert, but I'm pretty sure you'd hear those coming. Whoever played the two cops (i felt it unimportant to look up their names) were horrible, it was like two MTV Vjs. I know we weren't supposed to expect alot from this movie, but we at least expect to be entertained, and this fails like a blind kid on a driver's test."
2,Action-Packed,"Ice-Cube was great, as usual. The product placement was obscene (the fight between Shane and China when one was standing in front of a large Mountain Dew sign and the other in front of a large Pepsi sign). There were some visuals and effects worth watching and as stupid as the movie is in places, its stupidity changes tempo nicely and is really short. If its more than $5, pass on it."
3,BUMPY RIDE,"TORQUE succeeds only because of its incredible stunt sequences. Some obviously talented stuntmen pull off some wild stunts in this brainless, derivative actioner.Martin Henderson (THE RING) stars as a biker who was framed for selling dope, took off to Thailand and has now come back six months later to reclaim his girl and his life. Not so easy, though, when the nasty dude whose drugs Ford still has stops at nothing to get them back. They even frame Ford for the murder of the brother of a rival gang leader (the incredibly thespian-challenged Ice Cube, who has one facial expression: snarl). But the plot is secondary to the intense action scenes and TORQUE isn't slow paced at all. For adrenaline driven action, TORQUE is okay."
1,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"I knew I was renting a mindless action movie, but this was the worst, least entertaining movie I have ever seen. I love motorcycles so even though I wasn't expecting much of a story I thought it could be fun. The action was terrible, the dialog was terrible, the music was terrible, and it wasn't even unintentionally funny enough to entertain. I tried to like it on some level, but it wasn't possible. The worst movie I have ever seen."
2,When is the Ice Cube going to melt,"I think it was supposed to be Fast and the Furious with motorcycles but where Fast and the Furious succeeds this falls down on its face. Part of it is lame, completely unrealistic story. While I like cool stunts and bikes, this was just too unbelivable. And let's not forget the ""FBI agent"" and his sidekick. Is that a joke or what? What really ruined it for me was Ice cube(where did he come up with that nickname-he likes ice cubes?). I don't understand why would anyone put him a movie since he can't act if his life depended on it. He scowls a lot and that's about it. Overall, not even remotely entertaining."
2,Just okay,"There were parts of this movie I found entertaining, but it's not something I would watch over and over again. Myself a biker, I can appreciate the ""rush"" they tried to give over and over again with the bike chases and stunts, but most of the stunts were so physically impossible that it ruined whatever credibility they could have had. (Yes, it is impossible to do a stoppie and simultaneously swing the bike around so the rear wheel, which is in the air, whacks someone next to you in the head then continue to ride at 160mph).I agree this falls into the category of ""Biker Boyz,"" if you liked that movie, you will probably like this one. But it isn't an improvement, and it's really missing originality when it comes to the plot. The acting isn't that bad, but when you don't have great dialogue to work with, there's only so much you can do to make it not look cheesy.And yes, this movie does include the so-infamous-it's-almost-cliché line ""I live my life one quarter-mile at a time."""
5,Torque,"Biker Cary Ford is framed by an old rival and biker gang leader for the murder of another gang member who happens to be the brother of Trey (Ice Cube), leader of the most feared biker gang in the country. Ford is now on the run trying to clear his name from the murder with Trey and his gang looking for his blood. The motorcycle scenes are flashy. The choreography of the bike tricks is incredible. Stunts are unbelievable, and entertaining. If you like movies that involve motorcycle riding, you will enjoy this movie."
3,Pro's and Con's,"well,+ for the visuals+ for the actors+ for a very sexy Jamie Pressely- for the over the top stunts- for the very visible change from road bikes to motorcross bikes made to look like road bikes doing the offroad stuff- for all the fake CGI bike fighting"
1,Never received merchandise,"The trucking company indicated that the merchandise was left on my front door but I never received it. I was home that day going in and out of the house and I never saw any packages, furthermore, this is the first time that any packages delivered to my home have been lost.I reported the situation to the vendor on 5/28/08 and they are still investigating but the fact is that after a month I still don't have the merchandise that I bought and paid for."
4,works for us,We have a 20 year old reining mare who is benefitting from this product. You would think she is a different horse. This product has given her added years of riding.
2,Not only physically thin,"This is NOT half as good as what Martin Fowler usually writes (don't know about K.B.). Most of the book is not new to me - a lot of the book seems to be a rehash of my earlier readings on project planning. Furthermore I hate the really childish examples! If you want some good books on planning rapid (iterative) development go for:""Dsdm Dynamic Systems Development Method : The Method in Practice"" by Jennifer Stapletonor""Rapid Development : Taming Wild Software Schedules"" by Steve C McConnell."
1,Very Similar to Extreme Programming Explained,"If youve real Extreme Programming explained then this book offers very little additional information. Most of the books in this series are very similar to each other. If you've read one, you've gained most of the knowledge of the others. They could easily be condensed into one 350 page book, and that would be worth [money].Save your money, read XP Explained or XP Installed, skip this one. Its only of interest to those who have never read any books in the series. Even then you're better off reading Extreme Programming Explained."
5,"...plans are useless, planning is indispensable","From the Preface: ""...planning is so valuable and important, that it deserves to go on a little every day, as long as development lasts. ""For those of us who have read Kent Beck's Extreme Programming Explained, you realize that this means planning is as important as the other things that Xp does every day: analysis, design, testing, implementation, deployment, and maintenance. Martin Fowler and Kent Beck show us how Xp helps us with planning every day, and how the individual practices of Xp let us know where we actually are.This book should be considered required reading for any manager with, or thinking of starting, an Xp project."
4,Objective overview of XP planning,"Using a very objective and simple approach, the book presents the xp way of planning in a very easy and enjoyable way. It does not contain much practical advice, but it is an excellent starting point for someone who is not familiar with xp and its practices. After reading this book one should definitely look for ""Agile Estimating And Planning"" from Mike Cohn. It contains a more thorough approach on the subject."
1,RIPOFF. AVOID. Rehash of other books.,"This was a complete waste of ....First of all, ... for 140 pages is a ripoff, compared to the other XP books in the series which have almost double the pages. Probably they could get away with it because the 2 authors are widely known.Second, this is a subset of whats in Extreme Programming Installed. XP Installed is a great book and explains everything covered in this one and more. This book had about 10 pages of additional information that XP Installed didnt. ... for those 10 pages is pretty expensive.Third, Considering the books short length, its further anoying that almost a third of it was just a rehash of what XP is. The real content of the book was maybe 90 pages, and even that has lots of blank pages, end of chapter white space, etc.Save your money, and dont buy this book. Instead read XP Installed. While this book is fair, its just a ripoff of XP Installed and covers less. Just a quick buck for the two authors cashing in on their names."
4,Great Product but Do NOT Buy From MyTableware,"I bought a full set of Rondure years ago. I love them. I'm writing this review just to say that MyTableware is not who you want to buy this product from. I ordered some replacement spoons from them and they never shipped. Amazon cancelled the order because MyTableware didn't ship within 30 days. I tried to contact MyTableware but no one ever got back with me. Will have to pay more to get them from someplace reliable, I guess!"
5,Pure comic genius!,"Parker proves once again that even without the benefit of the tremendous hype ComedyCentral has pumped out for South Park, his sense of humor is outrageously fantastic!This is truly one of the funniest films I've ever seen. In fact, my friends and I saw it 3 times in the theater, then went on an evangelic 'mission' of our own - to convince anyone we could to go see it right away, before its totally undeserved NC-17 rating drove it from the big screen.The acting was perfect - bad in just the right way, and both Parker and Stone show they've had the skills to pay the bills for a long time now... if you like South Park at all, you should LOVE this film. Ron Jeremy is hilarious, as is ""Sancho,"" among others. And I want a Choda-Boy Action Figure!!My friends and I have been eagerly waiting for it to be released on video, and I personally can't wait to own it. Really!-joolee"
5,I have seen this hilarious but rare movie!!!,"I have seen this movie at the theater. Trey Parker, creator of South Park, is down right hysterical in this movie. It's the story of a mormon from Utah who enters into the porno industry in L.A. Later he tries to clean up the city by becoming a super hero, Orgazmo man. His sidekick is equally as funny. On top of this, it still manages to keep an underlining good theme."
5,OMG!,I always thought I had good taste. This movie proves I was wrong! I don't care! I gave copies to family members for Christmas with an apology to the ones who live in Utah. Funny is funny and this movie is funny!
5,The best romantic comedy of the year.,"Tray loves his wife so much he would do absolutely anything to please her. They want to start a family and have a nice wedding. When Tray has an opportunity to earn some money starring in an action-adventure movie he decides to take the part although it is against his mormonic believes. The movie is a big hit and is featured on the cover of the Time magazine. He makes a lot of dough but his fiancee comes to LA to visit him and discovers the truth. To win her back Tray uses the supernatural power invented by his friend Ben. Ben has two PhDs from MIT and Harvard in electronics and nuclear physics. Please notice hilarious scenes of rapping black japanese man, flying sausage which blows the house, the first kiss of the loving couple, (there are so many of those I'd get tired just remembering all them). In conclusion - this is a hit you and your family (excluding children under 12) cannot afford to miss."
1,Stink Bomb,"I have lived a fairly long life. I am crazy about movies and films, the more subversive the better. I have watched thousands of movies, many of them mind-numbling rotten. This is the worst movie I have ever been subjected to. I walked out after about 50 min. An absolute stink bomb, it fails on every level..........argggggggh."
3,"great movie, but no extras","I thought that this movie was a little expensive. Then I read the review that said that it came with three commentary tracks plus another disc full of extras. So I figured it would be worth it. That review, by the guy who said he made the disc, is a lie. There are no extras on this disc, but I love the movie. If you are willing to pay 30-plus dollars for a DVD that is JUST A MOVIE with no extras, then this is for you."
4,Funny movie,"This is definitely one of Trey Parker's more entertaining flick, and I loved BASEketball. It was non-stop laughs. As a mormon, and a one time missionary myself, Trey hasn't a clue what he's talking about! But, it's still funny. I recommend this to anyone who wants a few laughs... Beware, however... Trey's obsession with guys butts shows through even more so, than with BASEketball. Beware, the Fat Lady Stripper also makes an appearance in this flick... eww..."
4,"How did this film get away with so much...oh wait, never mind","This film mocks the mormom religion, the porn industry, and super hero movies all in one. Trey Parker plays a mormon who's in California just trying to pay for his wedding. But when he meets porno-director Maxxx Orbison, who won't take no for an answer, he becomes the title charecter. Now, I'm not always the best judge of charecter, but the director Mr. Orbison has too much authority that I found rather unbelievable. Basically, because he makes so much money, he thinks no one can refuse him, let's just say he finds out otherwise the hard way.If you're a fan of South Park, the poor taste humor will be more than enough to amuse, however this film could've just as easily been rated R as opposed to X, oh well. There's barely any nudity for one thing, plus the so-called sexual content is mostly simulated."
4,Funny,Matt Stone and Trey Parker are two big jokes. Everything that they do is funny. How can you take these guys seriously? This movie showcases the low budget works and creativity by these two. What a crazy plot. I liked. ****
4,"Orgazmo is great, but the ""Special Edition"" DVD is very bad.","Don't buy the DVD! It's a hatchet job!The DVD does not compare favorably with my VHS version. The transfer to DVD is colorless and even blurry. Those who argue ""widescreen"" should look again at their VHS copy. The DVD letterboxing is fake! There is good picture above and below that the damn DVD arbitrarily cuts off! The best aspect ratio might have been 1.66:1, but knee-jerk letterbox fetish nearly drains the movie of its vitality.The extras are duds.Keep your unrated video, with candy colors and big, big jokes. Buy two, they're cheap!"
4,"The funniest ""guy"" movie I ever seen!","Firstoff, the point that I want to stress the most is, that this pretty much is a ""guy"" movie...okay, an immature ""guy"" movie!Since I bought the movie 8 months ago, i have yet to find a female who finds any of it even slightly funny, that's what I am basing my opinion on.But I you are an immature 18-50 year old male, you will laugh your orgazmo-rader off! As soon as the opening music cues, you'll be rolling.This movie has everything a porn spoof should have! The music, the corny dialogue, the cheesy actors, and,,,Sancho!"
2,WHAT A MISTAKE,"THIS VIDEO WAS AWFUL. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY FOR ANYONE WATCHING IT AND THE ACTORS WHO WERE IN IT. IT WAS ABSURD, UNFUNNY, SOPHOMORIC HUMOR. I WATCHED ABOUT 15 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE BEFORE TOSSING IT INTO THE GARBAGE. BUYER BEWARE, YOU CAN JUDGE SOME BOOKS BY THEIR COVERS."
3,OK Early Effort From Trey Parker,"Despite the provocative title, ""Orgazmo"" is not as outrageous as it would like us to think it is. Either that or we have finally caught up with Trey Parker's raunchy sense of humor. The film purports to be a parody of the porn industry and it does take it's shot at that world but in it's heart it's a send-up of comic-book action films. The film has it's share of inspired moments but it's not as consistently funny as Parker's later efforts, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut"" and ""Team America:World Police"". I recommend this film to Parker fans. It's not a bad film in the least it's just that Parker has evolved and honed his comic skills beyond what is on display here."
1,Orgasmo,"Bought this movie , because my Sister recommended it and thought it was one of the ""FUNNIEST"" movies she had seen...so the anticipation was pretty high, when I received it , two days later..( AMAZON IS THE BEST at FAST Shipping)..After watching it, both my Hubby and I agreed, it was one of the WORST movies we had seen...on the verge of flat out DUMB...WE are fans of movies like American Pie, Waiting, ect..but this movie was not worth the money that we paid for it...Sorry, but true..Not funny, just dumb..Would I recommend it to any one that I knew...NO..but will be sending to to My Little Sis as she was going to buy it herself....Gave this film one star as I HAD to...otherwise it would have gotten 0.."
3,Hilarious poking at a goofy religion,"Though I must admit the movie is a slap-stick comedy, it is absolutely hilarious. It will never be considered a classic but for this genre of Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, it's a perfect comparison. The story of a poor guy who has been under mind-control of mormonism and then gets transplanted out to California to actually make his own choices in life. I can't say I agree with adult movies, but after living the life he had to, well, he finally gets out of Utah and that is reward enough. If you want a movie to sit back and laught at pure goofiness, this is the one. Too bad Trey couldn't have made a previous movie about how funny his life was growing up listening to psychics."
4,Very Funny,I've watched this multiple times and it makes me laugh each time. Stupid humor can be a lot of fun and this movie is stupid. In a good way.
4,"""I don't want to sound queer or nothing...""","If you are a fan of Trey Parker, South Parker, or basicly crude humor, then you should like this movie. Not made to win any awards or make some profound statement, this movie is all about being silly and sometimes making jokes that are just plain wrong. ""Orgazmo"" wasn't as funny as I thought it would be, but it still has plenty of laughs."
3,strange and funny,"The movie is a strange and off beat film that keeps your interest. The creators of South Park, who probably would have been damaged by the psychotherapy they didn't receive, made another odd and funny movie. This is one worth buying."
1,Sad that people like to see these movies,This movie about a Mormon missionary that becomes a porn star is vulgar and crude. Trey Parker seems to have no respect for other people. The only thing he cares about is his money.
4,This is funny,"This movie was very funny and allowed the viewer to see what goes on behind the scenes of Porn with a comic over tone you wouldn't believe. It's all in fun so if you are offended by sex and or religious natures don't watch this but if nothing offends you this movie will have you rolling on the floor as you see Trey Parker, of South Park fame, deal with Hollywood as Orgasmo with his sidekick Scrotum-boy. This movie is funny."
5,Great Movie,"A great film, if you're a fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. A little dumb, if you aren't."
5,I am SOOOO mortified that I watched this movie!,And I can't wait to get my own copy so that I can watch it again and again!
3,COULD OF BEEN FUNNIER,"I expected something as good as Baseketball. Wrong. When I first saw Baseketball, I had to buy it on video. I waited for Orgazmo. I feel that the small role that Matt Stone played was hilarious. Other than that, I just thought that Trey Parker could of been funnier. Overall these South Park guys really shouldn't drift that far away from the television."
5,HILARIOUS!!,"I was very pleased with this movie. I grew up in Utah and lived in L.A. for several years. The movie was right on the nose for it's portrayal of Mormanism. I would recommend this film to anyone and plan on buying a copy for myself. If you like to laugh, watch it!!!"
3,Doesn't deserve NC-17 rating!,"This movie was very South Park in humour. Apart from showing male buttocks and sex toys, this movie was tamer than Basic Instinct. Loved the Twin, Haruko."
5,The Official Orgazmo DVD is almost here!! <Cheers>!,"It's about time they officially released this DVD is the US. I have had the substandard import DVD for some time now and what they say about it is true: Very poorly produced. But, it has kept me in stitches for this long!This movie is actually one of the best produced pieces that Trey has done. The wit is smokin' hot and for you NOT to laugh yourself silly makes me wonder what you're watching. One of my favorite lines of all time is still: ""I'm going to have to screw you to death!"", and Chodaboy's reply ""I'd like to see you try!"". ROFL!!Amazon.com originally had this slated to be released on 3/22/05. Now I see it's moved back to 3/29/05 - please, NO MORE DELAYS!!"
4,A great find,"This movie is a great find, not quite as good as Trey Parker's first movie Cannibal, but very enjoyable. It is a bit better than South Park, and a whole lot better than South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut. The story of a Mormon who becomes a porn star. I don't know about anyone else but I didn't see anything in this movie so offencive it should have been rated NC-17 it should have been rated R the way it is, I have seen movies with worse subject matter rated PG. The soundtrack is also great."
2,Big let down,"I want to start by saying that I am a huge fan of the South Park show, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I loved Team America. That being said, I was really disappointed by this movie.It's not totally without laughs, but after watching it once, I decided right then and there that I didn't want to watch it a second time. If you're a Trey Parker/Matt Stone fan, get their other stuff first, and this one ONLY if you want to complete the collection."
5,Another MASTERPIECE!!!,"Yes, They have done it again ladies and gentlmen. Matt Stone and Trey Parker have teamed up once again to make another movie that I could watch over and over and still find something new that is even more hilarious then the first. I was unaware that this movie got an NC-17 rating until I saw it on this website. It should NOT be NC-17. Yes it has language and yes it has nudity but Trey and Matt got shamed with that rating. This movie will give you hours of laughter. ENJOY!!!"
5,You'll Never Laugh So Hard,"This is one FUNNY movie. Too bad it's so difficult to rent and buy. The NC-17 rating is a stretch. I'd call it a solid ""R"". Yeah, it's a bit raunchy, but the movie is fun-spirited and not at all exploitative. Extra-bonus Kung Fu scenes and funky music. Trey Parker as ""Elder Young"" is great."
4,"IF YOU LIKED ""BASEKETBALL"", YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE","Noticing the nc-17 rating, i was a bit leary of renting thisone, but when i watched it, i had to have it! Trey, Matt, and Dianmake their third movie together and of course it's non-stop laughter. when you see dian as choda boy and matt as dave the lighting guy, you'll be stealing lines from this movie in no time. Definitely buy this movie and listen to what the other amazon viewers say-- the nc-17 rating it got is a sham."
2,crappy copy,I love this movie but the copy i got was crappy. The sound was off-dubbed.People would move their lips and wouldn't be saying anything.
2,Not what you would expect,Not as funny as I would have hoped. I also don't really understand the NC-17 rating. Did I miss something? There were no private parts exposed here male or female. Oh well. To each his own.
2,2 stars for Chasey Lain.,"Orgazmo is really a bad movie, but 2 stars has to be awarded to the sight of Chasey Lain, who must be absolutely most beautiful and sexy woman in the world."
2,"if you like karate chopping mormans, then this is your ride","Trey Parker (South Park) has really outdone himself in this movie as he plays a Morman who suddenly gets a starring role in a porno film called Orgazmo in which he plays the lead super hero/ stud muffin. His partner is Dian Bacher who would be the most shortest and skinniest porn star ever and soon Orgazmo is one of the top grossing movies of all time. Parker knows his territory and he delivers a slick script but the only problem is that the really raunchy stuff falters this. Matt Stone (South Park), Parker's buddy plays a camera guy who always sprouts the line "" I dont want to sound gay or anthing but"". Pornstar Ron Jeremy plays one of the co-stars. If your a Parker and Stone fan then this is the treat to you but it is a dissapointment for me, though I liked the fact that a Morman can have karate powers."
5,graet product,iam very happy with this product it had no scratches it played as if i just took off the wrapping
5,If you want to die laughing....,"This is super funny. From the creators of south park. I don't know how to explain it, you just have to see it. The title says it all Orgazmo."
5,The movie,The order showed up as promised and in the condition promised I would order from this seller again. I had never seen the unrated version of the movie and I liked it the first time I saw it this is even better than the original one I saw.
4,Classic Trey and Matt,"As my title says, classic Trey and Matt. It's a bit more crude than their later things but that's because of the specific subject matter. It's not as graphic as one just seeing it on the shelf would think. It IS hilarious. The particular one I bought is the one with ALL the extras. I think they overdid it with the outtakes. They put too many of the same scene when it was messed up and did it too many times. I love outtakes, but I found myself thinking, ""enough already! Show me a different one!"".All in all, it's just a goofy and silly Matt and Trey movie. As long as you don't offend easily and enjoy other work by these two goofballs, you'll like this one as well."
4,Hilarious Action Porn!!!,"This is a very funny movie about a Mormon named Joe Young who needs money to marry his girlfriend. He gets offered a part in a movie, but it's a porno, which goes against his beliefs. He is a porno superhero. He finally accepts the role. Later, the director wants to do sequels, but Joe doesn't, so the director kidnaps Joe's girlfriend. Then, Joe and his porno-star friend need to bring the porno superheroes to life and fight the director to get his girlfriend back! If you love the stars of South Park, action, comedy, and hard-core porn, you'll love ORGAZMO!!!"
4,NOT a family movie,But the older teens would enjoy it's craziness. Twix a super hero movie with soft porn and BlammO you have OrgazmO ... four greasy buckets of pop corn and three cans of root beer out of five.
3,"cute, but...","These are cute pants, but they are made with very thin (though soft) cotton. I will not use be able to use them in the winter. The elastic in the waist of the pants is not secured, so it twists. I was disappointed, expected more for the price."
1,elastic gone after 3 washes.,"I was SO disappointed in this product. $[...] for a pair of baby pants and they didn't even make it through three washes before the elastic completely stretched out, and the pants just fell of my son. Really bad (and cheap) construction. Sure, they're cute. Sure, they're soft, but for $[...] bucks they should last the full 3-6 months."
2,Not worth price,I have ordered sckoon items from both company and zullily and find its only worth it when there on sale. Items r soft however very flimsy cotton and to thin for new fall never mind winter. Cute designs and I haven't seen anyone else sell similar style
1,like sckoon but seller's picture misrepresents pants,"Purchased the 0-3 month pants monkey pants navy stripe and loved them! Purchased the SAME pant for 6-12, and instead of this navy cream stripe they sent a larger stripe with navy and gray. Not satisfied with this pant color. The picture misrepresents the pant they actually sent."
2,Not what the reviews make it out to be,"I was sold on the reviews that I read and ordered the quick cam pro. Upon opening the box the first thing I noticed was the lack of proper instruction material. You have to read between the lines in the Quick Campro user's guide. If you have anything connected to the printer port, like a printer you will have to remove it and install the cam cable. Which means you can't use the printer.I would of liked to see a through connector like what is on most scanners so a printer and scanner can be run at the same time. Now I have to get down on my hands and knees and change the cable every time I want to use the printer or camera.So far the camera does produce some great looking pictures both still and movie."
1,NEVER RECEIVED ORDER,Ordered four bottles of Corticalm lotion and even though I have called and e-mailed I have never received the order. My credit card was charged and never credited. I was told it wsa shipped in early July and the post office lost it(??)I called and they said they would trace and call me which they DID NOT. I e mailed and still have not received a response. I would never do business with a company that ignores their customers.
4,gorgeous nonsense,"Getting a train out of Switzerland into France, Germany, and Poland, non-stop, under American orders(in 1977), with no border customs or immigration, no conductors who mention tickets or passports, and orders to shoot to kill those who won't stay on the train? Routing from Geneva via Basel and Paris(???)to Stockholm? Utter nonsense.The plot makes no more sense. The cast is feeble and ugly except for Sophia Loren.BUT, the pictures of the train from outside and inside, a few stations, and the countryside, for an European trainlover make the plot garbage endurable.Just watch the train (and Sophia) and you can resist the ""eject"" button."
3,Less than satisfying,"Great cast, great director, great premise.. Unfortunately the film was a bit too predictable and cliched for my taste. The final scene of carnage was brilliant though.Worth a look. Just don't expect too much"
5,Sermons,"If you want to be REALLY unhappy with the quality of homiletics in your parish church, read these. Of course, Msgr. Knox was never average, even in his own time.I would rate the book as a book down because the type is too small, but that's the way of the world these days. It's worth the eyestrain."
5,Good product,"Brother toner is a good product and works til the very last drop; when the light flicks on indicating that toner is needed, I can take it out, shake it a few times, and re-insert. It will then last for another month or two."
1,Brother Toner Cartridge,The toner cartridge is so light that we can barely ready the items we are printing out.
5,"Excellent product, excellent service.","First of all, always always always buy OEM toner. It lasts longer, produces better quality, and won't void your warranty. I used to repair printers, and have seen what happens when a cheap knockoff fails catastrophically. Hint: time to buy a new printer.The seller sent mine out first thing on Monday even though I ordered over the weekend. I received it before Amazon's estimated arrival date by a day. Fast, expedient service. This is the first time I bought from this seller, but I would buy again."
5,This side of the sea?,"These guys claim to be from Vermont - but I've lived up here in the North Country for nearly a score of years now and I've never heard anything quite so sweet!This Live offering features Tom Mackenzie...on the Hammer Dulcimer although he is no longer with the nationally touring group.Nineteen songs of pure Joy from the T. Sands ballad 'Daughters and Sons' to Ry Cooder's 'Alberta Bound' to 'Finnegan's Wake' and 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow,' a lighter, happier mix of songs from the Isles will never be found. Mixed with a nice element of audience interaction, you can just put it on 'Repeat' and play it for days!My family and friends can't wait for them to come back home to play for us!"
2,"Usable, barely","The shelf arrived with a bent corner; since neither the inner nor outer boxes were damaged, it must have been bent at the factory. As it turns out, it doesn't matter, because the holes are too far apart for me to get all the screws in.Don't buy this shelf unless you're using it for light duty and can get away with using just 2 screws."

3,a biased sequel to a great unbiased book,"The first book ""Photo Oops"" contained photos of many different politicians both Democrat, Republican and others in awkward moments.This book contains solely photos of President Bush in awkward moments. From this, it appears that the authors decided to join in on the ""Bush bashing"" Aren't there enough new photos yet for a bipartisan book? (not that I suppport Bush) There are certianly a lot of Bush photos, maybe because he got most of the media attention.They should do a third book after the election is over with some of the candidates in awkward moments. The photo of Howard Dean's famous scream would be a great cover photo!"
3,"Works good, feels cheap","The switch (I've bought 2) have installed easily and work great. The push button does not feel solidly built, but I have not had a problem with them. They definitely don't have that ""premium"" feel."
2,Disappointing.,"Catholic social teaching took an important turn when Pope John Paul II promulgated his magisterial encyclical Centesimus Annus in 1991. The Pope dealt with a wide range of topics, but focused special attention on economic justice. While there is much that a democratic capitalist (to broow Michael Novak's useful phrase) might quibble with in the encyclical, it nevertheless rewards careful reading. Unfortunately, this book does not do it justice. The book is in two parts. First, a poorly edited condensation of the encyclical itself. Second, a collection of essays. The commentaries mostly appeared in a 1991 issue of National Review. They average 3-4 printed pages. The analysis is uniformly shallow and even trite. In short, there is little here that would be of interest to the serious scholar or even the informed layman."
4,Easy-to-read summary of the beliefs of the Catholic Church,"The Catechism of the Catholic Church is an extremely popular reference for Catholics and others interested in the Catholic Church. However, it can be a difficult read, given that it changes voices all the time--quoting from Scripture, writings of the saints, Church documents, etc. In this case, these strengths can be a weakness to readers unfamiliar with reading Church documents. Father McBride provides a guide to the Catechism, complete with cross-references. He has an easy-to-read style that is accessible to all readers. His chapters are short and succinct. They are divided into useful sections: glossary, summary questions, reflection, etc. A good investment for anyone who would like to understand the Catholic faith."
5,Marvelous,"In fifty-five, two-page chapters, Fr. McBride breaks open and explains the much longer Catechism of the Catholic Church. Each chapter includes an opening narrative, a Q&A with responses excerpted from the Catechism, a prayer, a glossary of words and terms, and a personal reflection. It's a marvelous resource, with crisp writing and orthodox explanations. Fr. McBride also provides a brief history of catechesis that examines the failure of methods preached by catechetical elites for the past forty years. Anyone stuck in a vacuous ""let's sit in a circle and talk about the Sunday readings"" RCIA program, i.e., the RCIA program of a typical American parish, should treat this book as a godsend."
5,An Invaluable Resource of Substence for RCIA,We have been using this text for 3 years in RCIA to replace a program with little hard core catechetics in it. Both the team and the inquirers are well pleased with it. It should be used with a bible and The Catechism of the Catholic Church.
2,Unhappy with product,"The charger didn't work, the camera bag was cheap and the tripod didn't fit my Sony DSC."
5,Simple Blessings; 14 Quilts to Grace Your Home,"Every project in this book is to die for. If you like traditional, warm, country, reproduction style quilts this is a must buy."
1,tiresome,"News flash! Hold the presses! This just in! Communism has proved to be an abject failure. Film at 11.Here's a book for those who were living on another planet for the past 15 years. Or who need to be reminded, yet again, that people prefer democracy to totalitarianism. And who think that Sweden doesn't exist."
2,Unfortunately unconvincing,"The book is quite interesting from a historical point of view. However, its major failure is exemplified by Mr. Sowell review below. The tragic mistake of confusing totalitarianism with socialism is repeated here. Mr. Sowell's soundbite ""redistribution of wealth leads to redistribution of poverty"" is just plain wrong. Some counter examples might include Social Security, Medicare, and Urban Housing assistance--all products of socialism that have immensely benefited our society. Sweden, one of the most socialized countries in the world, is also judged by The Economist as one of the most economically competitive--the point is that Sweden is socialistic but democratic. That a learned scholar, Mr. Muravchik, would fail to clarify the difference in a substantial text is disappointing."
5,excellent academic and practical review of biblical material,"John Wilkinson is a medic and cleric whose insights into the biblical material on health and healing are unrivalled. He explains academic material in a clear and comprehensive way. For those who wish to study the biblical background to the Christian ministry of health and healing, it would be difficult to provide a rival to Dr Wilkinson's book. As someone involved in writing courses and lecturing on health-care, I thoroughly recommend this book."
4,Balanced and informative,"I would say this book is very interesting and informative. I wouldn't agree with everything he writes but overall I feel the book is very balanced,interesting, and informative."
1,received book weeks after expected,"Although I did eventually receive my book in the mail, it was 2 weeks later than expected. I had to find the book through other avenues as I needed it for a graduate school class and it was a huge inconvenience to not receive it on time. I received the book approximately 1 1/2 months after I ordered it. I will not be ordering through this seller again."
3,"very nice, but not deep enough for my liking","It is a beautiful spoon, not sure if it's worth $16! I'd been looking for a round soup spoon, I make a lot of soup in winter and most spoons I have found are cheaply made. I though paying a bit more would get me a better spoon. It is sturdy and elegant but my search for deeper bowled spoon continues."
3,packaging,"Love the CD BUT, if your like most music lovers you want a little more put into your re-issues! Sound quality is excellant but the packaging is horrible. No front cover pict, no liner notes, just a listing of the tracks on the back sleeve. I should have just went I Tunes for half the cost!Amazon...music lovers want the whole package!"
3,"If it isn't one thing, it's...","CD-R's are fine. It's the person preparing your shipment that may be screwy. Labels mis-spelled, some titles in CAPITAL LETTERS and some not. Some track listings may be incorrect. No info on who wrote or performed on the songs... just a pretty one sided label, a jewel case and a CD-R. A burner, a printer and some paper, and you, too, are in business..."
5,"Oh Tom, You Have Outdone Yourself...","If you read Sandbox Wisdom, you loved the book. The Four Sides of Sandbox Wisdom takes those concepts to the next level. Tom does an outstanding job of enlightening the reader to extremely intense philosophical ideas that are sure to benefit any person regardless of your profession. All the while allowing you to digest his ideas through the intriguing and easy to follow story line written in novel form. One of those books you will want to read 3 or 4 times, keep a highlighter with you, or a pen to make notes. But perhaps the best part, Easy enough reading for guys like me who like to get to the point and keep it simple.After reading, you will definitely tell your friends and cohorts about the book you just read."
3,Confessions of an insider,"This book is basically about a group of rich NY guys: Jonathan, Arno, Micheal, David and Patch. More like a Gossip Girl in a Boy's point of view. I was excited in starting this book. I found myself laughing in no time. It was hilarious. But later in the middle, i was rather disappointed. The character build-up was slow and the plot's a bit shallow. But near the ending, things were heating up and the characters were explained. So in conclusion... it's not a must-read but a great book if you're in your bikini, sunbathing in the beach."
5,Basicly the final word in campgroun directorys,"The Woodalls directory is a complete review of all there is to look at when it comes to campgrounds. It is also on the web, but I have found it nice to have the book for times when we are off the web or just planing our trip. The reviews seem consistently accuret and include websites and phone numbers."
4,A fun book.,"I read this book as a child fifty years ago. I remember it enough to wonder if it's still available. I remember it as a delightful fantasy in which famous people in history get together on the ""Houseboat on the Styx"" and inter-relate. It was a delightful peek at historial figures in a unique setting. The best kind of satire."
5,"Good product, great company","I've added this flavorful but not too hot product to practically every food I eat for years. It had been available at local grocery stores until several months ago. I was shocked to see it priced at more than $8 at another mail order source so happily ordered several bottles from Amazon (Chili Fiesta Gourmet)@$4.50. My order arrived three days after placement in perfect condition and with free samples of other products. I recommend this product and this source to anyone who likes to ""spice up"" their food."
5,cajun sunshine hot sauce,"Most stores have discountinued this hot sauce, it's very hard to find. I'm cajun from Louisiana and this is the best hot sauce I ever tasted. Hope it stays on the market, I won't buy any other."
5,Cajun Sunshine,"The perfect blend of hot peppers and vinegar! This is awesome on just about anything- buy as much as you can, as it is often difficult to find locally. It is our absolute favorite hot sauce- and we have tried dozens!"
1,The lamp as shown is not the claimed 16 inches tall,"The Designers Edge product photo and description falsely imply that the lamp as shown is 16 inches tall. I purchased the lamp based on that claim. The lamp is 16 inches tall only if the overly long, not shown, tail piece is attached. The is false advertising."
1,Misleading Advertisement,The description reads 10 per box. I thought I was ordering 2 boxes but when the product came there were only two folders.
3,Would you believe...?,"This production was originally filmed as a musical for theatrical release. The songs were edited out and this version of ""Great Expectations"" was released to television instead. Michael York does a credible job as Pip, and Sarah Miles is excellent as the snobby Estella."
4,great expectations cd,Well done dvd given the story material. Best to view after reading the book.Great Expectations (1974)
1,Awful and BORING,"I teach high school English. The book was actually much BETTER! None of my 93 Freshmen students liked it. I can see why... It's incredibly boring, with tacky sets, costuming and average acting. Plus, why do the main characters (Pip and Estella) look so old when, in the novel, they are young and beautiful.Do not buy!!! Your students will hate you!"
3,"Video fine, sound muffled.",The movie video viewing thru a Sony Blue ray device worked fine however the sound seemed muffled. It was difficult to understand most of the voices.The video content was clear and the movie itself is a fine rendition of Great Expectations.
3,"It was good, although sound was poor in some areas.","The acting and scenery were good. The sound, however, seemed to go in and out. I would still recommend this."
2,"This is the guy who wrote ""Won't Get Fooled Again""?","The lyrics on this CD are sophmoric. My jaw dropped when I read through the lyric sheet and listened for the first time.I knew Pete Townshend had lost most of his integrity when I started hearing The Who's music schilling nearly every product known the mankind. Now this CD. I just cannot get over the fact that this is the same man who wrote Quadrophenia and The Who Sell Out.What few musical highlights there are on this CD and vastly overshadowed by lyrics that could have just as well come from the junior high school band I played in 25 years ago. I started that band because of The Who. This CD will never inspire anyone that way.The only good I can see coming from Endless Wire is that it clearly confirms the notion that rock music is best left to the young and insprired and that if you are old, rich you are boring. Unless you are Bob Dylan, but I'm not sure Bob is really a rock musician anymore."
4,Solid album with some weak songs,"Solid album with some weak songs. Some of Rogers vocals are terrible, but others are classic Who. Overall a solid album though."
3,who were they,"i wanted to like this cd, but honestly i don't. it's more like hearing the ghost of the who. who-sounding, but really not one great song, more b-rated songs or song fragments. ""it's hard"" even had better songs. and i am a fan of ""face dances"". but this one i find boring. not even good enough to want on my iPod.the packaging is nice. it's smart that they added the bonus dvd. otherwise, i'd be reselling my copy."
2,Weird and sometimes boring,"24 years without a new studio release and at last Townshend comes with hti snew baby. And it shows. Recorded without any sens on unity, in a lot of studios, with a lot of guest musicians, with Townshend handling the cards more than ever, the only great aspect is Roger Daltrey's vocals, still top notch.The songs ARE NOT ROCK'N ROLL for the most part, but trips around a lot of styles. Townshend really tried his best to be different. But I think it could have been better."
2,disappointed,"I'm not sure what i was expecting. I am a long time fan of the who...this did however come with a DVD which i expect to be a little more exciting than the album. I was, basically, disappointed. I have their box set 30 years of maximum R&B, which i thoroughly enjoy and would agree with anyone that they were one of the greats of their time. I dont have every Who album so i'm not their biggest fan...but i do know and appreciate all types of music and this album simply just didnt rock it for me. Seems slow and similar to Willy Nelson's Phases and Stages...wise words, i'm sure very poetic...it's just not quite what i was expecting from Pete Townshend. Maybe after a second or third listen, when i'm not expecting to hear what i'm used to hearing from The Who, i will be able to appreciate this music."
2,I really wanted to enjoy this album,"I really did. I'm a big fan of The Who, and I love their classic hits and albums. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find better singles than ""I Can't Explain"" or ""I Can See For Miles.""But Endless Wire...just plain sucks. Imagine Townshend rehashing old musical ideas with only half of the brilliant band that made them work, and that is what you have here.""Fragments"" is a slapdash of ""Baba O'Riley,"" and it doesn't even come close to measuring up to the greatness of the latter song. ""Black Widow's Eyes"" features the same rhythms that Pete used in ""I Can see For Miles,"" and ""In The Ether"" tries to sound like Tom Waits, but only Tom Waits can sound like Tom Waits.There's a few bright spots here; ""We Got A Hit"" isn't bad, and ""It's Not Enough"" comes closest to being classic Who. But if anyone ever wondered how much of an impact the now-departed rhythm section of Keith Moon and John Entwistle had on The Who...look no futher than this album to find out."
1,Endless Ear Ache,The who are reaching to hard to be The Who they once were. The CD has absolutely no rememberable songs. They should call it quits. I got an ear infection from listening to it.
1,Who Cares?,"Just another way for them to make a quick buck, if any copies sell that is!!! While we are at it why don't we get McCartney and Starr back together and call them The Beatles"
3,50/50,"This reminds me of a half Who and half Townshend solo. First 9 tracks are The Who. Fragments w/ an intro salute to Baba O'Reily, Dylansque lyrics on A Man In The Purple Dress. Mike Post Theme is classic Who one of the best tracks on this CD. In the Ether Daltrey sounds like Tom Waits which is the only song that doesn't fit in this section. Black Widow's Eyes could of came from Who Are You album. Two Thousand Years and It's Not Enough has that sound from It's Hard album.Mini-Opera tracks 10 to 21, Wire & Glass to me sounds like it's part of Townshends solo recordings. Only a few tracks I consider Who material like Sound Round, We Got A Hit, and Mirror Door.Daltrey's vocals are good on the studio songs but when it came to the DVD Live At Lyon tracks his vocals on the classics cuts I take goes w/ age. He does a decent live version of Mike Post Theme that is catered more to his present day vocals."
2,Irrelevant. Uninspired.,"There is no purpose to this recording. When Pete Townshend wrote ""Music Must Change"" he was at least aware of self-plagerism. Every song on Endless Wire sounds like retread of another song. ""Fragments"" starts off like ""Baba O'Riley"" (Who' Next), ""Sound Round"" is ""I've Had Enough"" (Quadrophenia), ""Pick Up The Peace"" is similar to ""Sister Disco"" (Who Are You), etc.Endless Wire makes It's Hard seem like a masterpiece. At least there was ""Athena"", ""Eminence Front"" and ""Dangerous"". Nothing on this realease is memorable except the horrible singing voice Townshend adopts on ""In The Ether"".There are so many better new recordings out there. How about moving on?[DW]"
3,The Who is Dead; Long live Pete and Roger,"My fellow Who fans, it is past time to declare the Who officially pronounced dead. What you have here is what is probably Pete Townsend's best ever solo album, with Daltrey sitting in. The Who featured the greatest rhythm section in rock, without them it just isn't The Who. Zak is as close as anyone can get but he still isn't Keith Moon. And whoever the bass player is on this album, he is merely adequate. Do you really want to besmirch The Ox's memory by calling this a Who album? Come on, shake yourself."
5,Meet the New Boss...,"Despite the fact that Endless Wire isn't quite in the league of Tommy, Who's Next, or Quadrophenia, repeated listening nudges this disc closer to five stars than four. The fact that The Who have made an album this good this late in their career is nothing short of astounding.Virtually every song here is remarkable, whether it's a fired-up rocker (""Mike Post Theme"", ""Mirror Door"") or a stripped-down ballad (""Man in a Purple Dress"", ""Tea and Theatre""). There's never been a Who album with this much variety, and it's not lacking in passion.Quite simply, it's not hyperbole to say that this is the best Who album since By Numbers (1975); indeed, you have to go back to Quadrophenia (1973) to better it."
4,"Thank you, Pete and Roger","While not The Who's best work, we should be only grateful to have this wonderful CD. Is it ""the best Who CD since _______ ?"" (place your favorite Who CD here) Probably not. Does it break new ground or add anything significant to The Who's body of work? Definitely. Is it flawed? Yes. Does Roger's voice sound frayed at times? Yup. Does that matter? Nope. Is it a moving CD in its own way? Very. Does it bring a sense of repose that is unique to The Who's body of work? Yes. Would it have benefited from Entwistle's participation? Absolutely. Do Pete and Roger embarrass themselves in any way with this? Absolutely not.Thank you, Pete and Roger, for giving us this music, which didn't need to exist, yet which is a moving and welcome addition to a tremendous body of work."
5,Do you remember?,"Do you remember Tommy or Quadrophenia? Were you a young fan of The Who at that time? Well, stop remembering and listen to this CD! Although time has passed for everyone of us (as you can see on the bonus DVD), the sound and soul are the same.Don't miss, hurry!"
2,I was dissapointed,"Where are the power chords, the heavy guitar sound ?The tunes did not generate any excitement for me like the Who's tunes of the seventies and early 80's. Roger's vocals are still alright to me, though."
3,"I prefer ""Wire and Glass""","I prefer the songs contained in the mini-opera ""Wire and Glass"". For me, the mini-opera (tracks 10 through 19)has the better songs. Daltry does not hit the notes like he use to, but who better than Roger has earned the right to sing Townshend's songs? Especially since most songs in the mini-opera veer from boastful, to sad, truthful, poignant reflections of life in the world of rock music and the summing up of one's life."
2,disappointing,"As a Who fanatic, I was very disappointed with this effort. Pete's writing has mellowed way too much for my taste. I recently saw the Who perform live, and the low points of the concert were the songs from ""Endless Wire"" and Roger's voice as he was almost completely unable to sing. He claimed to be suffering from bronchitis, but he was able to play the harmonica flawlessly on Baba O'Riley."
4,Glad I gave it a 2nd listen,"Not too impressed the 1st time, I slipped on a pair of headphones and gave it another chance. Glad I did! While (to me) it's not as good as Face Dances or It's Hard, it's a welcome addition to their discography.With the exception of ""In The Ether"" there really isn't a bad cut. And had Townshend delivered ""In The Ether"" in a normal voice rather than Grover from Seseme Street, it could have been on of his best. This CD dosen't play as I feared it would (a Pete solo record w/ Roger's vocals)but a true sounding WHO album. I doubt we'll see another so enjoy it."
4,Great to hear new Who music,"As a longtime Who fan, I thought I would be disappointed by this album, seeing as how two original member are now gone. But, I was happily surprised. I find the chorus of certain numbers like 'Two Thousand Years'and 'We Got a Hit' (almost sounds like The Who from the 60's) sometimes stick in my brain. 'Sound Round' really rocks. And the acoustic numbers are really good. I didn't think I would feel that way, as I like to hear them rock. It's been 24 years since we last heard new Who music. Hope we don't have to wait as long for another batch."
5,Can't Stop Listening to it,"I have been reading some reviews on Amazon about this terrific album and I am flummoxed. Are these people listening to the same record I am listening to? I think not! I bought it and listened and listened again and again, and I find the songs totally inspired. The songs offer a variety of tempos and sounds that keeps things interesting. The lyrical content is Pete Townsend all the way: poetic, ironic, inscrutable at times, and often argumentative. My favorites are ""Mike Post Theme"", ""Black Widow's Eyes"" (with a sublime vocal performance by Roger!), ""It's not enough"" and ""Man in a Purple Dress"". The Wire and Glass mini-opera is enjoyable with just enough structure and coherence to make it believeable. This record is really essential for any Who Fan. I have always loved 70's era Who, and this CD harkens to that time when they were cranking out anthems. Ok, I'm biased, but Endless Wire was truly well-worth the wait."
3,"Long time Who fan, slightly disappointed","As a long time fan of The Who's early work, I was expecting a little morefrom Msrs. Townshend and Daltrey. 'It's Not Enough' is the rocking-ist tune on the whole CD, but the jury is still out. 'Pick Up The Peace' is very catchy, but the CD just doesn't have the rebeliousness about it that Pete's earlier works have. This is definitely a mature sounding piece of work."
4,Wake up call,Jeez .. a Who fan from old smash 'em days.A small note if ya get it ...Fragments .. a touch of SmileBlack Widow's Eyes .. Love cuts deep2000 Years ... A cry from Airplane daysPick Up the Peace ... Dance in the night with hopeBang on any table to the mid riff of Mike Post ThemeGet it ??? If not we'll start all over at Pictures of Lily .. but that's a long story ... Have I waited ???
1,Shameless,"This CD is an absolute train wreck; disrespecting the Who's legacy in every regard. Don't be fooled into thinking that you might hear something that even faintly resembles the power of Townsend and Co's earlier work. Instead, what you get after waiting 20+ years is recycled, derivative music coupled with nearly incomprehensible lyrics that hint at things I, for one, wish to know nothing about -- ""man in a purple dress"", ""meet me in the ether"", etc. This CD is a sad, sad way to waste your money."
2,Give It UP,"Roger Daltrey sounds terrible. I am a huge The Who fan, but this is it. They were done after Who Are You?. It is time for them to give it up. Only buy for Pete Townshend's writing and playing."
2,Not the WHO I grew up with,The latest from The Who is not that great. The DVD that comes with it is ok but it is painfull and sad to see Roger straining to hit the notes. Still in all it is the Who.
1,endless dudd,"I just picked up this cd after waiting for 24 years. I was really looking forward to listening to it especially after listening to Wire and Glass. I was hoping this would sound like Quadraphinia or Face Dances, but i found that most of the songs were boring and seamed to lack direction and focus. Even the dvd was not up to the Who's usual standards! The dvd consists of half a dozen lackluster performances that were filmed in lion France earlier this year. I'm so sorry for this negative review because I'm a huge fan of the Who! I really wish I could add something positive or at least less harsh, but all I can say is that THIS CD STINKS!!!"
1,Endless Ire,"Pete Townsend said that he would not write a new album unless he thought it was good enough. He thought wrong. In my opinion, there are no memorable melodies that will stick in your mind. Both Roger and Pete's voices are straining and unemotional. Much of the lyrics are bland. The only redeeming quality of this album is Townsend's acoustic guitar playing. It's beautiful and richly complex. But that is not enough to make the album listenable. It is, however, enough to earn the album one star."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I listened to this garbage 3 times over the weekend. I think I was hoping it wasn't as bad thought it was the previous time, but I was wrong. These guys should have stayed retired in 1982. Anyone who hasn't bought this yet, DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think I'm going to listen to my kids Wiggles cd, it's a lot better than this junk."
1,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,The lousisest album of the year 2006. 'We got a hit' is alright.Its unbelievable that 'The Who' cut this disasterous album. I wonder if all that theyve been smoking have damaged their musical brains.I wouldnt have anything to do with this album even if someone gave it to me for free.
1,You Better You Bet The Worst From The Who Who,I receive this compact Discs for Christmas from a Co-worker. I did appreciate it but this compact disc is very boring and slow for the music of the who and put you to sleep fast. I'm glade that I receive it as a gift and I don't have the gluts to tell the person that gave it to that the disc sucks at all cost. Please dont 24 years again put out trash Peter for this is You better you bet a Bad CD and a sleeping pill from you
1,not a good reunion album,"The WHO sound tired and uninterested, espessially live they are horrible.....whatever happened to this great band. This album does not suck as much as ""It's Hard"" but it's close. The Who's best songs can all be heard on a greatest hits package, the other 90% of their output is filler or boring drivel. The one song I liked here was ""Man In A Purple Dress"" but even that only makes this album as a whole worth one star."
1,I want my Who back!,"What the heck we're they thinking with this album? Too folksy, artsy fartsy. After all the many years waiting for a studio album, I was very disappointed. I wanted to smash my guitar. This is what happens when half the band die."
3,"Welcome Back, Roger and Pete","This isn't a return to the days of Who's Next or Quadrophenia, but then again it doesn't have to be. This is the best Who album since The Who By Numbers. It definitely puts It's Hard, Face Dances, and (heresey) most of Who Are You to shame. One thing that I found very striking was the ending - ""Tea & Theatre."" Most Who albums end with lots of bombast, like Love Reign O'er Me, Won't Get Fooled Again, or even Who Are You. With Tea & Theatre, we get just Roger, Pete, an acoustic guitar and a drum machine. Very intimate and very out of character for The Who. Likewise for the song ""A Man in a Purple Dress."" Just Roger, Pete and a guitar. Pete Townshend hasn't shown this much vitriol in song since the days of The Who By Numbers. I pretty much like the whole album, but I can do without the Tom Waits impersonation on ""In the Ether."" Skip that song - you won't miss it. Buy it!"
4,Has Grown On Me,"Bought the album the first day out as I would normally do, with a group such as The Who.Liked the album,but didn't love it.I like ""It's Not Enough"" & ""Black Widow's Eyes"". Than saw The Who on March 11,2007 at Nassau Coliseum.They did the ""Hits"",plus several tracks from ""Endless"".I respect the songs more and realized how good the album really is.""Man In A Purple Dress"",""Black Widow's Eyes"",""Fragments"",""Mirror Door"" and a couple of the shorter titles were done. If you are a Who fan,casual or fanatic,pick this one up if you haven't already.It is REAL good!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Some Good... Some Not So Good,"First off, let me say that I really love the way this album is laid out. The ""mini-opera"" was a brilliant concept... no doubts there.Secondly, I wish this album were better! The music is pretty simplistic (for you musicians.. there is simply too much I-IV-V) and the lyrics are only slightly better (although they often resort to really ""redneck"" lingo and unpolished words like ""crap"".) I really can't recommend this album.That being said, ""Trilby's Piano"" is achingly beautiful, and ""Fragments"" is close to brilliant (the synth recalls the earlier days of ""Yes"".)Sadly, the bulk of this album only warrants a 2 out of 5."
3,I really miss the early Who,"As a fan of The Who since discovering the American release of the Substitute 45 many decades ago, I've followed all of their releases (and enjoyed them live at SF's Fillmore as well as Monterey Pop) with great interest. Endless Wire has none of the fire. It simply never takes off and is way too acoustically driven. C'mon Pete, go back and listen to the My Generation LP. I simply found this recording boring, especially for one with the first new material in many a many moon."
4,The Who Rocks,"After the disappointing new songs on The Who-Then And Now, Endless Wire is a very pleasant surprise. It's not quite as powerful as the classic albums, and shows a more subdued, mellower writer in Pete Townshend, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The two Who frontmen are still quite capable of creating that great Who sound, and its here. If you can get the Best Buy version with the Live At Lyon bonus disc you get to hear mix of classic Who along with the some new material performed in July of 2006. All in all this album is worth picking up for any Who fan."
4,It's The WHO.....,"what else is there to say. It shipped fast, and i like it. You should just get it and try it."
3,Who the heck are the Who?,I liked Endless Wire. Some of the tunes harken back to the Who's heyday. I just look it this as being a Pete Townshend album with Roger Daltry-but no complaints there. The album holds up very well and includes some damn good tunes.
2,NVSH,"24 years should be enough time to come up with SOMETHING new, but there is Nothing Very Special Here. Townshend has always had a pretty narrow range and he hasn't broken through any boundaries on this album. ('A Man In A Purple Dress' is pretty gutsy, and I detect a decidedly Anderson-esque bend toward a Christian world view. I like that; you might not) If you must spend your money, pop for the W/DVD version. This CD will get one more listen and then, I suspect, sit on the shelf ever after. If any more come out, I won't be fooled again."
2,Who are they?,"No matter how much technical mastery, no matter what kind of legendary instrumentalists are performing, and no matter if they can still sing or not, if the songs aren't there, then it is not worthy of repeated listenings.There's no hooks, there's no anthems, there's no inspiring melodies.And without the songs, the Who becomes very pedestrian indeed.If you're a die hard Who fan that has to own everything they've ever released, then buy this one and store it away, cause there ain't much here worth listening to more than once.If you're not, pass this one by."
2,Not the WHO I hoped for,"This CD had high hopes of the old WHO and the WHO of now, but the songs all sounded the same, no energy, no WHO, don't get me wrong I love the WHO, but this could have been better."
3,For Only The Most Faithful of Who Fans.......,"I didn't have high expectations, but I was still disappointed. Out of the 19+ songs, only three or four are Who-worthy, with the rest being sloppy filler material. Most sound like Pete Townsend demos, most of which are uninspired. No passion, a few interesting tidbits, but a sad end to what was once a proud rock n' roll force. It's almost like they didn't even try very hard. However, for the $15 pricetag they also throw in a live CD (pretty decent), and a DVD, so for the price maybe a good buy for the faithful Who fans..."
1,What the He** is this??? NOT The Who,"After 35+ years as a Who fan, all I can say is Keith and John must be rolling over retching at this tripe. This has to be the worst excuse for a Who album. This whole effort lacks any energy or even one power chord of old. Pete, what happened?? you wuss!! This would have been better released as a Pete Townsend concept album, Not The Who. Don't waste your money on this, just remember the Who with fond memories of old. Oh and Roger and Pete, don't trip over your skirts playing anything on this album Live........"
3,Thanks for everything,"I began following The Who when I 10 years old when I first heard Tommy. I was a poor kid with nothing more tahn a transistor radio, and occasionally I would hear The March of Dimes, using Tommy can you hear me. Over the years The Who taught me more about my self than I ever new and I thank them for that. I never new what was comming, and I was always anxious, not always impressed. Remember The Who changed rock music more than any other band, they went into areas no one would have ever considered. They set the standard for what a rock muscian is. The Endless Wire has some moments of The Who, but it can not be compared to the old band, because it is not the old band. I like most of the music, it is stirring to listen to what they are still capable of."
1,changed in a good way...except for the vocals,"Endless Wire lacks the true vigor of the original Who. The acoustics of the songs are slower and jazzier which is different from the original Who but still good. Pete Townshends creativity and skill definitely show through from all the different instruments that he plays and all the new melodies.However it is the vocals that bring the record down. In both the recorded tracks and the DVD Rogers voice sounds strained and old. His vocal range is limited to lower notes and his voice no longer contains the power, vitality, or rebellion that once was what the Who rocked about.I had heard many good reviews for this album and I was very disappointed in what I got. The return of the Who is a dream come true for many devoted fans but to me, Roger just doesn't have it anymore. I would support Pete Townshend in creating his own album but that would mean the Who would no longer be. Oh well, let's just move on."
1,Do they give zero stars?,"They should have died before they got old. Not in any way making light of the passings of John Entwistle and Keith Moon, but this disc should have never been released. Truly a disappointment from Townshend (one of my favorite rock artists), and Daltrey's voice is totally shot. This is comparable to watching a baseball old-timer's game, except the old-timers don't take themselves seriously. As far as listening to any future Who material, I won't get fooled again!"
2,Disappointing,"The Who are my favorite group, and ""Live at Leeds"" is my favorite album, but this CD is only marginally better than ""It's Hard."" There are only a couple of songs that sound like The Who, but Pete and Roger sound tired. On the DVD, they look tired and sound less than enthusiastic. Zak Starky is a great drummer, but without Keith Moon and John Entwhistle, The Who just aren't the same. When Moonie died, they should have called it quits like Led Zeppelin did when Bonzo Bonham died."
1,if there was a 0 that would be my rating,Dont get me wrong im a who fan.I own al their recordings i mean all.But this is their worst recording.Roger cant sing anymore and townsend is unispired.Boys its time to hang your gloves.Pete you were right HOPE YOU DIE BEFORE YOU GET OLD.This month im going to see aerosmith hope they dont sound so bad as this who recording
2,Don't Get Fooled Again,"Look, I wanted The Who to put out another great record as badly as anyone else. But Endless Wire makes It's Hard sound like Who's Next. The fact is this album is a relentless mess. It's cute to have the obvious nod to Baba O'Riely in the beginning of Fragments, but then it dives into thoughts that are silly (""a piece of you is a piece of me""). The album beats you over the head with the bogus ideas of religion with Man In The Purple Dress and Two Thousand Years. The ""mini-opera"" Wire & Glass justsound like ideas that never get fully developed. In The Ether sounds like Pete Townshend trying to do bad Tom Waits. Only in a few cuts like Black Widow's Eyes do we get a hint of the power that could have been on Endless Wire. Instead, it just feels endless."
3,Good Songwriting - Not the Who without Entwistle,"Although I am a huge Who and Pete Townshend fan, I cannot give this more than 3 stars. The song writing is strong and it is nice to hear Daltrey sing Townshend's new material, but the tracks definitely lack without Entwistle. Listening to some of tracks like ""Its Not Enough"", you can imagine John filling all the gaps and wailing away on the bass. I can see why they continued after Moon died, and I am glad they did, but the Who is not the Who without Entwistle. Overall this is enjoyable to the casual fan, but die hard fans will not be able to get over the gapping hole left by Enwistle's absence."
2,OK but not great,"I'm a huge Who fan. I've seen them live, and with Moon on drums too. This CD is just OK. My advice would be look for classic Who, if you don't own any CDs, and buy it. ""Live at Leeds"", ""The Who By Numbers"", ""Tommy"", ""Quadrophenia"" and of course ""Who's Next"". I guess when you get old you run of things to say. That's what seems to have happened to Pete Thownsend."
2,Who's This?,"Been a Who fan since around the time they lost Keith. Seen them in concert 13 or so times, met them, love them. Enjoyed later albums like Face Dances and It's Hard more than most. I wish I could agree with those Who fans on here who have really turned on to this album. It hasn't happened for me yet. Yes I know they're not really The Who anymore, they're the Who's Left, and Daltrey's voice is so hoarse Springsteen's laughing at him. But I'd still think Townshend could craft something sufficiently reminiscent of their older stuff to make this album decent. Care to try again, guys?"
2,Not Good,I wanted to like this I really did. I love the song good looking boy that they did in 2004 on a best of collection and I thought yeah they still have it. Then I got this and I thought no they really don't. This is by far the worst record they have ever done. I could go on but what would be the point. Trust me save your money.
4,the Lifehouse Method,"I am a Who fan, have been since 1979.I have listened/viewed ""Endless Wire (w/DVD)"" once, so far.I wonder ""Who might enjoy this new WHO album?""Other WHO fans? most likely.Fans of the ""classic-rock FM-radio genre""? probably not.Tom Waits-style folksters and new-age yuppyfied-hippysters? by all means.This Who album might just be another chapter in the ""Lifehouse"" project. Yes, that's it: Lifehouse...has now come full-circle...a Townshend home studio idea/Meher Baba ""Who Came First"" germination, then a proposed Who project, then ""Who's Next"" picks up the pieces, then turned ongoing-Townshend solo project for over three decades ""Psychoderelict"", now turned back over to an absolutely-Townshend-dominated Who....yeah, that's it, exactly. If you enjoy the Lifehouse idea, you will most likely enjoy this interesting new WHO cd.[...]thank you for your attention to this matter at this time."
4,Pleasant suprise,"I was a bit worried when I heard about this CD. I still enjoy seeing the live stuff from them and I know Daltrey isn't the powerhouse young voice he used to be, but they can still entertain an audience. When I heard they were doing a new album this year I didn't know quite what to think about it. Songs like 'We got a hit' 'Black Widow's Eyes' and 'Fragments' make me glad I purchased this one. There's a couple duds here, but I don't think I've ever liked 100% of any Who album apart from Who's Next or Live at Leeds.I do, however like more than 85% of the stuff here, which made it a great purchase, since I wasn't expecting much. If I had the chance, I tell Roger and Pete: Thank you. Thank you much for adding this to your collection of really good work."
2,Who are The Who without Keith Moon???,"Many Who fans acknowledged this, but it seems to me that not enough have understood this concept. Pete writes majority, it not close to all their music, but without Kieth... there is no energy. They haven't released anything good since his death in 1980. There is no drummer that could possibly replace Keith of the Who.The Who (of the 2000's) should go under a different name because The Who isn't quite Who when Keith isn't their. This material is annoying, the lyrical content lacks in concept and direction. Sorry, but I don't think the members live up to the title ""Endless Wire"" because this album marks one of their worst efforts (I guess it's better than ""Face Dances).""That said, this album isn't too bad, but it just isn't the Who. My Who died in 1980. Their last great effort was ""The Whoo by Numbers."""
4,Almost Great,"The bad news: Endless Wire is like the failed ""Lifehouse"", in that it needed a Glyn Johns to trim it down into a ""Who's next"". The Good news is that with the magic of CD technology, you can do this yourself, and the result is the best Who record since Quadrophenia.Since you can't burn this disc - at least not legally - you can't make your own mix-tape version (unless you actually make a cassette tape); so I recommend that when you play EW you simply program it as follows:...Marty RobbinsMike Post Theme2000 yearsWe Got a Hit (extended version, not the Wire and Glass version)It's Not EnoughYou Stand By MeFragmentsBlack Widow's EyesSound RoundPick Up the PeaceMirror DoorTea and TheaterPlay it loud. Enjoy."
5,The perfect ballerina outfit!,My daughter absolutely loves this dress. Not only is it a beautiful outfit but the music it plays is nice and loud enough for them to dance to! Great buy for a little ballerina.
4,Great Upbeat Music,"Well, this cd is great. I heard their big song Better off alone and been hooked. They have a beat in all their songs that makes you wanna get up and dance. I highly recommend this cd if you are into dance and club and DJ music."
5,Solid TV Mount,"Very happy with this TV mount. We used it to mount a 50 inch Panasonic plasma TV and it has performed exactly as we hoped. Installation was a little tricky but that's mostly because we were installing it on a wall with metal studs, which is hardly ideal and not one of the options that is discussed in the manual that comes with it. But we figured out a way to make it work and it seems very secure and sturdy. The mount itself is heavy, which is good because you want something solid when it's holding up something that expensive. I appreciate the ability it gives you to tilt your TV up and down on an axis--we had to hang the TV a little higher than we would have preferred and by tilting it down slightly, the viewability is greatly improved. I would buy this mount again and recommend it to others without any hesitation."
5,Soild,"Bought this to mount a 42"" plasma tv over my fireplace. While I didn't install it (we were doing major home renovations), the contractor said it was easy to install and a very well built mount. The price was much less than we were quoted at Best Buy and it arrived in on time for our project. We're probably going to buy another to mount the tv in our master bedroom, so I'd definitely recommend it to others."
5,Golden Movie,"The camera work is magnificent. The cast, directing, and music excellent. A story of an aging couple spending a summer at a cabin by the lake could not be done better. Poignant scenes such as Henry Fonda and his real daughter Jane making up after years of separation and disagreements are memorable. Discussions of life and death are very well done.Fans of movies like ""A River Runs Through It"" should find this to their taste. An English professor retires and finds he is in his waning years and he must come to terms with a dysfunctional family. It proves challenging and rewarding. Some great fishing and comradery with a young soon to be grandson lighten his reconciliation.The DVD is top quality and includes many extras about the movie. I recommend this to anyone that likes family dramas."
5,A total comfort movie.,A compelling drama: well acted and directed. All the players are superb. The music is wonderful and quite memorable (how often can you say that about instrumental music from a movie?).Very higly recommended.
4,On Golden Pond,"Accurate description of sale item at a competitive price regarding our exchange rate. Excellent service with no hassles and a very good selection of titles.It works very well which is why I use it.The particular story is played very well by Catherine Hepburn,Henry Fonda and his daughter Jane."
2,Gack!,I have tried to watch this movie more times than I can count and every time I fall asleep. It would have kept my attention better if an angry bear broke in the house and mauled a few of them.
2,Bad Acting,I could not understand how others thought that both the acting and the attempt at reality was entertaining. Please forgive me but much of what I saw was forced and not very enjoyable to watch. I guess I missed something.
1,On Golden Pond video,Very disappointed with the video. It was blurry and kept going from light to dark making it hard to see. The voice was hard to hear.
1,on golden pond,"Disk will not play. tried on 3 different players. I ordered for a gift and when they tried to play ,would not work."
2,Better with the sound turned off.,I have so much respect for Kathryn Hepburn's work that I was felt sorry for her putting up with this disrespect even as a character.The language was so foul and assultive (is that a word?) that it was ruined for me.
1,Remake in 3-D,"They need to remake this in 3-D. As I write this, 3-D is on its way out (again), but could be saved by the right ""serious"" movie. ""On Golden Pond"" is that movie. I would recommend Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus to play the elderly couple (in age makeup, of course - or maybe not), and Bristol Palin in the Jane Fonda role."
4,Wonderful movie...but,"Such a wonderful movie package--beautiful music, locations, and acting--of a wonderful story. It could have been made even more special WITHOUT the profanity--GDs and BSs especially. Such language may be common place in the 80's but some people such as I prefer not to listen to it--especially in the presence of children."
1,On Golden Pond,"I received these 3 movies(gifts) in good order. But when I received my cr. card statement, there was an additional charge on my card. I have emailed Amazon and as of this date had no response. Be aware beforew you purchase from Amazon."
4,Wrench set,These were the wrenches that were requested for a tool chest and they were at a good price and arrived quickly
1,A portrait lacking insight,"I hesitated in deciding to review this book. Is it worth drawing the public's attention to a book that is, at best, descriptive journalism which promises more than it delivers? Only after reading the book did I acquaint myself with the author's journalistic reputation which helped explain some of my original disappointment with the book. As an academic, I cannot recommend this book to any serious reader interested in matters concerning the Windsor family. The book lacks proper endnotes and citations. Botham rarely identifies his sources but chooses convincing descriptive labels that suggest authoritative individuals with first hand knowledge. I am disappointed in Botham's ""soap opera"" treatment of a topic that is of genuine interest to many in the British Commonwealth. In short, save your money!"
3,Not what I thought,"I'm a little disappointed that the DVD had less material than the VHS tape I used to own. I bought the DVD because I thought they'd put more content on it, not less. They left a whole lot of wasted space. I'm not happy."
1,RIPPED OFF,"The item I paid for never showed up. It's a good thing that the seller didn't show up at my front door to steal my money. Things would have been alot different.This is the second review I've done about this, I guess Amazon.com doesn't even read them. The seller is from New York, so I guess it's ok to steal from people there.Here in Oregon this kind of crap is not seen that much."
3,Wrong picture for DVD,"While I truly enjoy David Broza, the picture shown was not the dvd sent. I thought I was ordering one concert I actually got another from two years earlier."
1,Contrived and silly and a big waste of money and paper!!,"This is the first and last book I will read by this author. The subject matter interested me but the dialog in the book is just silly. Very contrived. A much better book with this subject matter is by Nora Roberts, who writes a million times better, called ""Dance Upon the Air."" Her subjects and dialog ring true, unlike Fern Michaels'. I was glad Helen became a strong woman by the end but I found the whole way she dealt with her husband to be far fetched. This book also has one of the worst editing jobs I've seen in a while. Sam's eyes are the bluest eyes she's seen and two pages later, he has a warm brown gaze. Then there's a whole paragraph about Max, the dog, and the next paragraph starts out, ""She ran into his arms."" The dog's arms? Oh, no, it's Sam again. It makes it hard to follow. This whole book is [weak]..."
2,Be careful,"I am not familiar with the abused wife syndrome. It was chilling to read about what Helen was going through with her husband when he attacked her. It was heartbreaking to read how she felt worthless, and he felt justified. But the story around them did not hold up. Interesting, but not plausible. All the pieces fit together too neatly, and the ending was just a fairy tale. (Poor girl inherits millions and makes up with her estranged mother.) The characters' relationships with each other were not clearly explored. We understood why Helen's benefactor loved animals, but we had no clue why she befriended battered women. And Helen's decisions when trying to flee her husband are just plain stupid. I like stories with happy endings, but I want them to be believable. This book was a good read, but the ending was just too tidy. By the way, I lived in NJ for many years and it almost never snows before Christmas."
1,Awful......I put it down!,"After reading a previous book by Michaels called ""Celebration"" which I would give 2 stars, I decided to read this one, what a bore! I never even finished it! Don't even care how it ended. I will not be reading anymore books by Michaels."
2,"Great, riveting start but can't hold it for long","When I first started to read this book I found myself unable to put it down. The brutality of the husband and how Helen escapes was great. But, unfortunately, the story started to fall flat after a while. I really had a hard time believing how smart those two dogs, Max and Lucie were. The last straw was when Helen was loading the two dogs in the car. Max (THE DOG) buckled in Lucie (THE DOG) and then himself!!! Come on! I don't care how smart a dog he is supposed to be, there is no way he can do this! I was amazed that he didn't drive the car also. Have to agree with other reviewers that some of the dialogue was just plain silly and sometimes hard to follow. Too bad...the beginning had so much promise."
5,I loved this book,The story plot was outstanding. If you are Fern Michaels follower this is a much read book. I could not put it down until sleep would just take over.
3,Nice and efficient,"This is a nice little booklet, with a diversity of cheesecake recipes in it. There are no hard to find ingredients listed, and directions are clear for everyone to understand. No fancy techniques needed. It's a small sized book with only recipes, no pictures or coffee table quality intentions. The only purpose is obviously to list recipes that will accomodate every taste."
3,Small Package,"This cookbook has a bunch of really good recipies with easy to follow instructions. However, the book is pretty small and the recipies cover 2-3 pages making it a little harder to follow. Also there are zero pictures which makes baking cheesecakes for the first time a little daunting. Good recipies, not so great packaging."
1,New York Cheese Cake,"No New York Cheese Cake in this little ditty! But you are only out 10 bucks or so. I am still looking for a ""real"" cheese cake receipe without Graham Crackers in the crust. This collection was a waste of time and money."
2,the 50 Best Cheesecakes in the World,"The book itself is a tiny book (size), not what I expected. Haven't tried any of the recipes, it might be worth it's weight in gold? The picture on the cover is the only picture."
2,Disappointing,"Like all the other reviews say, there are no pictures in this book. It is a tiny little book. The recipes all look like they'd be ok, but I guess I am more into plain old cheesecake than with the exotic flavors of the recipes in this book. If you are looking for a lot of with cheescake recipes with LOTS (and I mean LOTS) of different flavors, this is book for you!"
3,Reserving final judgement,"Tiny book, no pictures, I mean absolutely no pictures. I'm very picture oriented when it comes to cookbooks. But I'm reserving final judgement til I try the recipes. But seriously no pictures at all, so disappointed."
2,So uneven a tribute,"In my opinion Springsteen's magic is the mood he captures in his stories. There were few songs on this cd that I felt did tribute to mood or story. Dan Bern's version of Thunder Road, Bullens on ""If I should fall behind"" and Patty Griffin's ""Stolen car"" which she has on her cd '1,000 kisses' are some of the ones that worked for me. Listen before buying is my advice."
2,They don't get it,"Did any of the artists on this actually unserstand springsteens appeal? Most of the covers on this CD lack the passion, desperation, anger, bitterness and yet hope that Bruce delivers.A few tracks, like Garland Jeffries cover of Philadelphia work, but must are disapointing"
2,Misleading prices.,"Ordering this could not be any more confusing. First there are 4 different colors from at least 4 different vendors. Some colors are priced as a box of 10, while others are sold as ""Each"". Some were Prime eligible...others were not. I thought I was buying 9 boxes of 10 for around $14 / per box. When the package arrived i realized I had spent $130 for nine (yes I said nine) single folders. They will be returned. The folder is decent, but it is not lined with gold. Overpriced."
5,Yay Yoga!,"I am new to yoga and admit to having felt intimidated by it in the past. While the video is challenging,I never felt discouraged or out of sorts. I loved all aspects of the video: the visuals, the education, the simple instructions, being able to select each part separately and the exercises themselves. I definitely plan to incorporate it into my workout routine and begin attending some yoga classes. I think it will work well for me as I need to feel centered, work on my breathing, relax and meditate while also feeling energized and stengthened. Gabrielle has produced an awesome video!"
5,Anyone can benefit from this DVD,"I just finished my first go at this workout. I consider myself an intermediate practitioner at least, and even still, I found it to be an aggressive (yet doable) session. You won't find most of these poses and movements at your neighborhood yoga studio, and the structure is such that you learn the movement, and then practice on your own to ethereal music, which varies by segment and is thematically appropriate. The routine was expertly chosen and if you don't believe me, I dare you to come to Philadelphia and personally grab my butt. Can't wait to do it again."
3,Difficult interface,"Though the entire dictionary is impressively complete, with plenty of examples and idioms, the computer interface is difficult to use. The navigation buttons are tiny, along with several other annoying idiosyncracies."
4,Good laughs,"This film finds Ernest as a handyman but wanna-be counselor at a boys' summer camp. A group of juvenile offenders is sent to the camp as ""Second Chancers,"" and of course Ernest ends up being their counselor. As a summer camp movie, the gags are a bit predictable- -the poison ivy scene, the animal scene, and the bad food scenes. Nevertheless, Varney's genius makes them fresh and funny.The subplot, the redemption of the Second Chancers, comprises the moral lesson of the movie. The main plot centers around the evil Krater Mine Company, which plots to take over the sacred land where the camp is located. The film itself is a bit more violent than most other Ernest films."
2,Not up to par with the rest of Jim Varney's (RIP) work,"I have to say that I was not as pleased with ""Ernest Goes to Camp"" as I thought I would be. The mood and motif of the film were far more rudimentary than other Varney classics. I felt that the story arc left much to be desired and the cinematography was slightly contrived. While I cannot recommend that anyone avoid seeing this film, I do want to express my severe disappointment at what I felt could have been the crowning jewel in the cinema oeuvre of Jim Varney. Again, may he rest in peace."
3,THE FIRST ERNEST MOVIE,"THIS WAS THE MOVIE THAT STARTED OFF A LONG RUNNING SERIES OF ERNEST MOVIES. IN THIS ONE, ERNEST P. WORRELL [THE LATE JIM VARNEY] HAS DREAMS OF BEING A CAMP COUNSELOR. THAT DREAM COMES TRUE WHEN HE'S CALLED UPON TO LOOK AFTER SOME JUVENILE DELINQUENTS AT LAKE CHIPPAWA CAMP. FUNNY AT TIMES BUT IT'S ALSO STUPID AND SOME OF THE GAGS ARE KINDA WEAK. BY NOW, THE ERNEST MOVIES HAVE BECOME CULT FAVORITES AMONG COMEDY FANS. BUT, I CAN'T HELP BUT COMPARE THIS MOVIE TO ''MEATBALLS''. THIS MOVIE IS SIMILAR TO THAT. BUT, FOR SOME COMEDY FANS, THIS SHOULD BE FUNNY. MAKES A GREAT FAMILY FILM. FOLLOWED BY ERNEST SAVES CHRISTMAS."
5,Hilarious,This ranks up there with Hey Vern! It's my Family Album! (if you haven't seen that you need to) I laughed so hard that I cried. The late Jim Varney was truly one of Americas greatest Comidians
5,You know what I mean?,"This is a classic comedy of epic proportions. Ernest is the lanky loveable camp counselar, who through his crazy antics and humorous character entertains for a full hour and a half. I love Ernest!"
4,The first Ernest!,"As far as the blu-ray is concerned, it was a bit unnecessary to release this on the format, as it probably has a clarity level worse than DVD, but I'm sure that has to deal more with the source material than the transfer.The movie is a bit silly, you'd definitely have to have the patience of a child when watching this. Some of the scenes are painful to watch, but I was still entertained while watching this with tongue-in-cheek."
5,A truly wonderful book.,"I was recommended this book by my Spiritual Director, and I feel that it has only helped me to better understand vowed celibacy. a fantastic read."
3,"Tervis awesome, Bealls is terrible","Tervis are excellent however Bealls is terrible. 3 times now I have ordered discounted product, they take my money then say not in stock so they refund. Meanwhile the very next day they have the product back but at the marked up price. they are absolutely terrible, their website does not link to their inventory either. Many many problems with bealls. Tervis highly reccomended but buy it somewhere else."
3,Possible title confusion,"pywrit.com listed this title as ""Manhattan."" This may be a confusion with a book in another Harlequin series. ""Between Two Moons"" is correct for the Superromance series."
2,This one is a dud,I own about every Cd or album from Santana. I love all of them with the exception of this one. It doesn't seem like he made this CD. Don't know what else to say.
5,Money well spent,"New to runabouts and restoration, I took the advice of others and purchased a used copy of this book. The book is written for the beginner, explaining terms, tools, and the like. I love the emphasis on safety throughout the book, as the author reminds the reader to work 'smart'. As I start my renovation this book will be at my side."
4,Highly recommended,"The 16' Glastron I bought on eBay turned out to have a rotten floor among other problems. Not a huge surprise - the boat is nearly 40 years old - but my experience with resurrecting derelict toys has been restricted to cars and motorcycles, and I didn't know where to begin. Jim Anderson's book was written to my level and gave me the confidence to take on this project. Highly recommended."
3,A little outdated?,"I found this item helpful, but maybe a little outdated. As a European, a lot of the stuff is a bit the American way. Eg. carpets i boats, which are hardly used i Europe. An option without carpets or vinyl would have been nice.The lack of presentation on new materials such as vinylcell (eg. Divinycell and other similar products)makes the impression that this book could be updated. But in general, it is very helpful. Nicely written, a joke here and there, and good focus on security, helth hazards and other information."
5,Enlightenment,"I purchased this book with a view to restoring an old (1968) fiberglass boat.I found it to be extremely informative, and giving a lot of information as to possible sources of materials and specialized help.This book, has made for me, what had at first sight appeared to be a monumental task, actually quite simple.I would thoroughly recommend this book to anybody intending to restore or repair any fiberglass vessel old or new"
2,awful,"My daughter needed to read two versions for school, we had one and I ordered this for the kindle. Huge mistake simply terrible! They did however give me a refund very quickly!!! Stars are for quick refund."
1,Poor quality !,"After changing all 5 engine mounts on my Civic I'm getting more vibrations than with the old, cracked, 14-year old OEM mounts. Seems like the Rear Left Upper is the worst one. Also some of the bolt holes are drilled in the wrong places (around 1/8 inch off). Just cheap Asian made parts. The price was good but I'll have to replace them again with the good staff. I will never purchase the Anchor brand again."
3,En-el3 battery plus charger,"Overall, this battery and charger do work, and get the job done. The green/red indicator light does not seem to work properly, and made me think that the charger wasn't working. It does take longer than an hour to charge my battery, but the battery does get charged eventually.The car adapter does not fit into my CRV's cigarette lighter,making it useless. If I were going to buy another battery and charger, I would get a name brand from a local store and pay a little more."
3,Bad on me,"Don't do what I did...order this thinking it would fit in my Dymo embossing label machine/gizmo. It actually does not fit ANY of the Dymo labelers sold here on Amazon or shown on the Dymo website. It is 1/2 inch. The ones sold here use 3/8 inch. I give it a 3-star just to catch other buyers' eyes. It also isn't in a cartridge, which may be standard for whatever machine it does fit."
3,"Great character return, bad story flow","I thoroughly enjoyed Kidd's work in 'White Plume Mountain', and I couldn't wait to read this one. However, while Kidd did a marvelous job with the character development (except for his rather brazen dumping of Enid), the story flow was greatly lacking, and left much of the early part of the book difficult to read through. Apart from the Justicar (a very high level Ranger) allowing his party to get lost by more than 500 miles, the entire novel read almost as badly (and with far too much similarity) to the disappointing 'Against the Giants' novel. While I do recommend this book to people who enjoy AD&D and/or 'White Plume Mountain', I do have to say that this work was very dissapointing. I would, however, very much like to see additional works by Kidd, especially featuring Escalla and the Justicar."
1,sucky book,I do not think this guy knows much of the systems cuz most of those spells were lame. the story was very slow and not very creative. I stuck it out and read the entire book but its not a book i would ever read again nor would i ever recomend it to anyone.
1,Less than 1 star,"I purchased this TV on August 6, 2006. Actually, this is the second tv I purchased. We purchased our first polaroid and when we plugged it in, we didn't get any power. So, after talking with customer service, the gentleman told us that the tv must have been mishandled and that we should exchange. So, we did. Now, 11 months later, our television died. No power source at all. I will never purchase another polaroid item. I am extremely disappointed with them."
5,Great Picture,"To make this short, Polaroid 323B offers a great picture quality, well up there with the top television brands for a 32 inch 720/1080i picture. Only thing negative is Polaroid Warranty support, they take forever to get service people to come fix your tv if there is any problems."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE FEW GOOD REVIEWS HERE!!! It's not worth your safety!!! We bought this TV a few years ago for my elderly mother who is living with us. She has a tendency to fall asleep watching TV but fortunately she wasn't sleeping when it caught fire!!! There is a class action lawsuit against Polaroid for these defective TVs! If you're one of the lucky ones who hasn't had a problem YET with these TV, be careful, it's coming! Our house could have burned down because of this TV. Polaroid has known of these problems for years and failed to fix the problem or issue any type of warning. I will never purchase another Polaroid product. They put a few dollars above their consumer's safety."
1,Keep away from this TV ..class action suit filed june 2011 !,This is the worst product I ever bought...$1000 waste of money it lasted only 3 years !Dont buy this TV! as Class action suit was filed in June 2011 against Polaroid due to over heating capacitors !
1,Polaroid Trash !!,"I've been in the repair business since 1975 and I have never seen a bigger piece of trash in my life than Polaroid. This also includes all LCD's made in China. If your consumers would stop buying TV's on price and do the math, you'd see your being ripped off. Come on , SMARTIN' UP..... Dan@DBS"
2,Great for the short time it lasted,"We enjoyed our TV for just over a year (1 yr warranty of course). The problem started small - one day the picture would not show up on the tv setting but the other dvd and computer settings would. A few days later it came back, but now the picture flickers to the point of a headache. Not worth the money we spent."
1,Do NOT buy,I had this tv for 18 months and I now have the same power issue that just about everyone who owns this tv has. Do a search on google and you will find the many many people with the same issue. The capictors on the control box are defective. This TV should be recalled.
1,"FLM 323b LCD is ""JUNK"" !!!!","I bought two of these units in early 2007. BOTH are alread dead. Local Polaroid certified repair charged me $50 each to determine that repair (power supply) would cost more than $600 EACH !!! Polaroid ""customer service"" ( a term to be used lightly) takes the attitude of ""Life is Tough.....get a helmet"". I'll personally NEVER again purchase anything bearing the Polaroid name."
1,Worst television I have ever owned,"The power supply blew out at 11 months. After 4 weeks, a repairman showed up to fix it but discovered Polaroid had shipped him the wrong part. Three weeks later, another replacement part arrives but Poalroid fails to send a technician. I ask for a refund and the customer service rep promised to send me a check. A month later, I call back and find out that guy has been fired and they will not give me a refund, only a replacement set. Yesterday, a replacement set came and guess what? It is defective right out of the box! DO NOT BUY POLAROID!"
1,Dead Polaroid,"I'm like the rest of you.Had the TV for about 14 months and it died. That's about $65.00 a month to watch TV. Now I have to pay to have it fixed, "" don't know what that will cost."" Plus what I pay extra for HD programing on my dish. I think I will go buy a plasma, whats another $1600"
1,Do not buy this TV!!!,"I bought this TV in September of 2006 and the first 8 months it worked perfect. Then it died,just like most of them and I waited two months to get a new power board and they sent the TV repair company the wrong board. So they sent me another one a month later and it was the wrong board. I have now been without a TV for four months and I'm still waiting for it to get fixed and thats with the 2 year service warranty. Do not buy a polaroid TV, it is junk and they do not want to fix it. Pay for a better made one!!!"
4,5+ years and still working,"I just want to add that I purchased this Polaroid TV over 5 years ago. I researched extensively before purchasing. I'm glad that I haven't needed Cust Support. I have run this TV almost 24/7 for 5+ years with little problem. The HDMI works great and so does the composite input (COAX). The sound sucks but I knew that when I bought it. Surround sound solves that issue. Every once in a while it looses it's mind (about every 6 months) I turn off, unplug and wait 10 minutes. Everything resets itself and good to go for another 6 months. I've repaired the remote about 6 times once because I dropped it in a saltwater fish tank. It is now taped but works fine. I guess I got a lucky set. I'm happy with the picture quality. I've used a Mitsubishi code for programming universal remotes. What else can I say the set has given me good service. Hope this helps someone. Tags are wrong, it is 720p NOT 1080i or 1080p"
3,not very sharp on sattelite signal,"Well, I just bought this flm-323B flat 32"" HDTV.You get an excellent image in HD or DVD sign, but on regular TV or satellite I see that it is not very sharp. I dont know because of the response time (16ms) compared to others. This is my first flat TV and can not compare. But I am not very well satisfied. I will need to buy my Direct TV satellite equipment, but I know that no all channels are in HD."
1,Save your money and time.,"There is only about 1/3 of a page's worth of useful information in this book. And it's all the same stuff you can find in any good book about parrot care (start young, use structure, be animated, use contextual references, be patient). A book by Blanchard, Athan, or Doane will tell you these things, but they will also give you much more complete information on training and care. This book is, instead, filled with many big, glossy photographs. They are beautiful, but quite useless. Perhaps this is a good child's picture book."
1,huh?,"What kind of live cd is this? Mostly solos from individual members and just a few songs? Are they kidding?! This should at least have everything that was on the 9021live video, but in my honest opinion, this would be a great cd if it contained the ENTIRE concert. It should even include stuff that they didn't include on the cd OR video. Songs like Yours Is No Disgrece, Long Distance Runaround, and Roundabout were played on this tour. But they don't appear on anything. 9012Live should be a 2cd set containing the full show. Maybe in the future they'll release it that way. Unfortunately, this is the only live cd that has Rabin and Kaye. Until they release this the way it should be, if you want a live Yes cd, the best ones are Live at the House Of Blues (House Of Yes, or whatever it's called) or Yessongs."
1,Good so good if you love 80's sounds and YES!!,Ok it isn't the goodest Cd of yes but!! I love it!! And yes!!I think it's good!!
5,TMF Hitzone #9,This is a great compilation of hits current to the release date. I got this because I'd seen most of the videos to these songs while on vacation in Europe. It's perfect to groove to.
3,Disconnected,"I was looking forward ot this book being the story of a lifelong journey through yoga and mediatation. Despite its promise, it seemed too disjointed for me to really enjoy reading it. The author jumps to and from various points in his life, ultimately confusing the reader rather than showing the fulfilment yoga has brought to his life. Further, the footnotes are very distracting.This said, I still think this book is very worthwhile reading for anyone with a serious interest in the meditative and spiritual aspects of yoga. Several of the chapters detailing parts of Yogananda's life, particularly his youth and his founding of the school in Ranchi, are a fascinating look into both his life and Indian society in general. The author does seem to have a very spiritual outlook. Sections comparing Hindu texts or ideas with the Christian scriptures are also very interesting."
2,AN INTERESTING BOOK INDEED,"This 1946 edition is ok, but a bit incomplete compared to the improved version with the orange cover. Yogananda Himself revised much of Autobiography and removed most data about communities before his passing in 1952. He also added a 49th chapter which is missing from this 1946 edition. if you want to see the masters best work you will have to look beyond this page."
1,Not formatted for easy Kindle reading,"While I love this book, this version is not properly formated for Kindle. The Table of Contents is indeed active, but the text is cut up into irregular line breaks making each Kindle ""page"" choppy and about 50% blank. Also, the footnotes, which are so juicy and enriching in this book, are awkwardly noted in the text and only appear at the end of each chapter by when you may have forgotten the reference. Lastly, the captions for the photos that appear in the printed book show up randomly in the text, breaking the flow and making you wish you had the real thing -- to see the photos!Read this book, but skip this version."
3,"great, but now what?","Maybe i missed something but i wasn't so floored by this. Too much hype maybe. For more of a ""to do"" spiritual book, i recently bought Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon."
1,A great disappointment,"As a fan of the Self-Relization centers in Los Angeles, I was very eager to read this book and learn about the founder. I was expecting insight into his philosophies and reasons for building this centers. However, what I found was a book of supposed miracles. For someone incredibly religious (and perhaps Christian, since the author makes a great effort to quote the Bible often to make his book more accessible to Christian readers), this may be a worthwhile book. But as a autobiography, the claims are outlandish and fantastical."
4,"Interesting,but slightly out of date.","This older 1946 edition of the Autobiography is interesting but slightly out of date. Paramahansa Yogananda made many significant changes, and added a 49th chapter before he left us in 1952. For those who wish to see his improved versions of this great book, look for the most recent editions with the orange cover. I find that his vibes are even stronger in these newer editions, which more accurately reflects the full meanings and import of his teachings!"
1,Disappointed,"We had read a copy of Autobiography of a Yogi from the library (8th Edition; published by SRF). We loved it! We wanted a copy of our own and ordered this version, not realizing it was totally without the photos, index, and footnotes. Also, the information about Self-Realization Fellowship is missing. The text appears to be the same, so someone just wanting pure text might be okay with this, but we are back to ordering the genuine article published by SRF."
5,"Moving, powerful,life-changing, spiritually enlightening .","This spiritual classic is considered among the best available for those seeking a deeper understanding of God and spirituality.Of all the books I've read this is by far the most powerful, most inspirational, I've ever come across. Everyone I've ever recommended this book to has told me that it was the best or one of the best books they've ever read on spirituality.This is THE book I would recommend if I were only able to recommend ONE book for the rest of my life.Because I KNOW that it has the power to alter your life for the better like no other I have ever seen."
5,Autobiography of a Yogi,"This is a life changing book. It is the best book I have ever read and often reread.. It is too bad he is no longer with us in the physical, but like all the great ones they pass on to the next level after their work is done, but their teachings forever live."
5,Change your world,"This-the only authorized version of the great Master's life-is a life-altering spiritual adventure. More than a fascinating read, Yoganandaji's story shares the secret science of Yoga and its potential for humanity. The real miracle he reveals is that we all may thus learn our destiny and purpose. This book is one which magnetically draws true seekers of Truth and of God to that fountain of Wisdom which quenches our deep thirst. We can check out AND leave the Hotel California of worldly disillusionment - at last. Kriya Yoga, the blessed gift of the Gurus of India, is the plane ticket."
5,Superb book,This is the most fantastic book I have read. Gives a very good insight into the life of Paramhansa and his gurus and also explains the secrets of life and living. A must read for all !
5,A classic...,"...but do check out the current classic work by the living perfected master, Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath - Wings To Freedom. Gurunath is of the Himalayan lineage of the great Nath Yogis. A born Siddha, he was transformed after His deep and personal experience with Shiv Goraksha Nath Babaji, the same Babaji referred to in Autobiography of a Yogi. So if you are left hungry for more after reading this book by Yogananda, buy a copy of Wings to Freedom and continue your journey on the path to Self-Realization."
1,Weird religious book,"I got this when I saw it as an employee rec at Barnes n Noble. Wow - what a let down - kind of a boring, religious biography and not the insightful philosophical tome I was expecting to read. It's a snoozer and I'm not sure why so many ppl like it - I guess they are ""followers"" sheep, whatevs."
3,A mixed bag,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who I enjoy talking with about spiritual matters. As a Christian who tries to be open toward other faiths, it challenged me to see God at work outside the boundaries I tend to place around Him. Yogananda's account is personal, readable, and (for the most part) credible.However, I found myself struggling at times with the fanciful tone of the book. Touching first-hand accounts were tossed in with legends of 300 lb. yogas who never eat. What are we to make of that? Still, definitely worth a read, especially if you want to investigate experiences of spirituality that are outside the usual Western models."
3,"Yogi, Jesus, Spirituality",Filled with fantastical anecdotes and wildly entertaining story-lines. Author not nearly as polished or inspirational as Emmet Fox (see Sermon on the Mount) but then who is?
5,Great Book!,"Is is fabulous book, extremely profound and very interesting reading. You know based on the readings that God does exist and we all can reach him!"
5,Inspirational,"Serving with spiritual means and guidance it is inspirational with the teaching's of wisdom. Wisdom is the foundation in the spiritual world. ALSO RECOMMENDED...""The Third Time IS Now"" & ""Conversations with God"""
5,A gripping tale of mans quest to know God. Spectacular !!,"A wonderful story, beautifuly written, about a boys journey to find his Guru and his God. Along the way he meets saints and sages and humorously tests everyones faith. In time the boy does find his Guru and God-and even his dear mother who had died so many years before. No obstacle can stop him. He gradually masters his powers and begins a great world mission. This is a true story with remarkable implications.The most inspirational book I've ever read!"
1,Archipel Gulag,"Imagine, something really bad happens to you, and someone tells you, this happens because of some crimes of your former life. You do not know what those crimes are. You do not know who you were in your former life. You do not even believe in such a thing as a former life. You get no chance to defend yourself against the crimes you supposedly have committed. There is no trial, there is no carefully selected jury. All there is, is a verdict, your pain, and this person who is accusing you of your alleged sins. And to make his point this person tells you about his and his friends mighty powers. In what situation are you? In Stalin's interrogation chamber? In the hands of the Mob? Wrong! You are reading Yogananda's book philosophising about Karma! Yoga might be a powerful tool for some people, but its ethics, as they appear in this book, are less than doubtful. They lack a sense for justice, freedom and an open heart."
1,A whole lot of BRAIN WASHING,"this is book contains a whole lot of Brain washing , making up a lot of wishy washy stories based on hindu mythology . Keep away , i would advise people to rather read Vivekananda and J. Krishnamurti - that's more sensible stuff"
1,A WORK OF FICTION,"The panegyrics stinks.Individualistic biases and notions of the famed author-guru built and sustained VERY BIASED and very romantic notions that later cramped and hampered a realistic outlook on the nation India, Indians, and *having sex* - which is not specially advocated in the book - and far, far less among monks and nuns that publish it. Said a lay members wife once about Yogananda, ""He has destroyed my marriage.""The work carries with it some negative effects."
1,Not Free,"""If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me."" (Mark 8:34) This is what Jesus said about the Self: deny it. He did not say ""realize your Self."" I am somewhat irritated where Yogananda got the idea from that he taught the same as Jesus. Jesus offer is that you give yourself to Him and He will shower you with His first-rate gifts and free you from the frustrations, the second best offers, the foul compromises and the lies of the world. Yogananda, on the other hand, offers that you will be able to utilize the powers of the world more effectivly. He offers you a promotion within the hirarchies of the world. With Yogananda you might be better of than before. However, you are even more bound to the rules of the world. You are not free. Whereas with Jesus you are free in the world."
5,Reads like a novel - and a guide for living,"The ""AUTOBIOGRAPHY"" changed my life when I first read it 20 years ago. Although it is a true story, it reads like a novel and is impossible to put down. The wisdom contained therein is remarkable. There are numerous biblical references, but the average 21st century Christian might view it as heretical because it also recognizes wisdom in other religions. Fortunately, the monks and priests the author met during his life had no such prejudices. My favorite book of all time."
5,A Spiritual Classic for the Modern Age,"This book will surely rank as one of the greatest spritual classics of all times. In the very first sentence of the book Paramahansa Yogananda mentions that Indian life is characterized by the search for eternal truths and the Guru - Disciple relationship. The entire book is an elaboration of these great themes, filled with wonderful insights. There may not be a more authentic spiritual guide for the modern age than this one penned by such a great Yogi as Paramahansa Yogananda."
5,Life Changing,"This book helped me to realize life and religion from a much higher perspective than I ever had. It's main point to me was that no matter what your religion is the greatest gift given by god is love, if it is given with free will to other people, or back to god, that is when god listens to you most intently, because you are actually doing his will as he taught us to do, once we do this, then all things thought impossible can become possible, miracles become an everyday occurence. Simply put your life becomes less complicated, and more appreciated by yourself and by others around you."
5,You won't want to put it down.,"This is the type of book that once you begin to read it, you won't want to put it down. It opens up an incredible world that not many know about. I heartily recommend it. Read it with an open mind, and it will open your mind."
5,Move Furthur if you have read this book.,"I have read this book two years ago. This book introduced me to sprirituality (so I feel). But the best part was that it gave me a path to move on, a base to investigate furthur. It appealed to me to move ahead. This book convinces you a great extent that (probably) GOD does exists. The only way one can be sure He does, is by trying to get to Him. This book gives you a first hand experience of a great Soul who did find HIM. Justice will only be done if all of those who read this book move on the same path. I have read a couple of more autobiographies of Yogis and they all look very similar and therefore confirm that there is a firm and known route to God. Indeed the similarity is so close, that, one can feel that the others did copy these ideas. But the other autobiographies are from different decades and centuries. Move Ahead do justice."
5,Best book I've ever read,I love this book. It is one of the greatest books ever written. I reread it over and over and have recommended it to all my friends and family. As an English teacher I've read thousands of books and this is by far my favorite. Wow.
5,Thought provoking and a great read.,"I bought this book with a little apprehension the reason being I had glanced at it about 7-8 years back, and had decided that I was JUST not ready for something like this. Fast-foward to this year - 2007, it took me a couple of months to read the entire book (I am a slow reader). However, I have to admit that I have learned so much about life, and living. The author's command of the english language is simply exquisite!I wouldn't mind re-reading it just for the language. I enjoyed just reading the words to gain more of the langage. The content was also good, I especially liked chapter 42 where he talked about souls etc.. All told, after reading the book I'm proud to say that I'm also an Indian!!"
3,A bunch of Hype to sell Kriya Yoga Lessons!!,"This books starts off with a hint or two about this mysterious ""Kriya Yoga""... probably to spark your interest it. About halfway through the book it seems like you can't read a single paragraph without the author mentioning Kriya Yoga. In this book, everyone successful in the pursuit of Yoga is of course a follower of this Kriya Yoga path. Although I enjoy the stories in the book and feel there is valuable information in it for spiritual pursuits, I don't appreciate the sales pitch. It distracts from the story and makes it seem more like hype to sell the authors Lessons which are available for purchase by mail order after being ""initiated"" online. I'm so sick of commercialized strip mall Yoga here in the Americas and was hoping this book, due to it's age and popularity, wasn't part of the sickening trend!"
3,Substance: 100 pages. Useless descriptions: 450 pages...,"I was disappointed by the low substance-to-fluff ratio of this book. Nevertheless, the level of wisdom and depth of spirituality it contains make the book worthwhile reading.You'd be surprised that most (if not all) the wisdoms emanate not from Yogananda, but from his master Sri Yukteswar and the latter's masters Lahiri Mahasaya and Babaji. This is why, after Yogananda's master's death, the book becomes very descriptive at best, and painful to read, with not much important substance. He spends too much ink on describing his sightseeing trips in his Detroit-made Ford, and his holy childhood seems to fade away.You should get this book if you have the patience and ability to skim substance from fluff. But if you want pure essence of wisdom with absolutely no fluff, I highly recommend the book ""Mystic's Musings"" by Jaggi Vasudev."
2,What's the merit in this?,"At the end of Walter Isaacson's biography Steve Jobs, he asks Steve what he has on his iPad. One book, and one he reads every year according to the book is Autobiography of a Yogi.I put the audio book on my iPhone and listened on a sunny bike ride. I can remember a tale of the author visiting a guru who was so strong, he could defeat a lion with his bare hands.Wanting to hear the tale again, I started the book from the beginning creating an image in my mind of each word. I pictured in my mind him telling his sister he will have a boil on his body tomorrow. He does. Then he tells her that kites being flown nearby will fall from the sky - chopped in battle by fellow kite flyers - and fall into his hands. They do.According to Isaacson's biography, Jobs delayed taking conventional medical action for 9 months, relying on unconventional practices. He's dead.What is the merit of these tales?"
2,"Entertainment, Not Enlightenment","The autobiography reads like ""Arabian Nights"", i.e. full of fantastical tales of miracles and adventures, filled with tiger-fighting superhumans, self-replication and teleporation, beautiful flying angels, aneroxic (i.e. non-eating) and exhibitionistic (i.e. naked) yogis revered as saints (provoking a lot of unintended laughters), and even a hoary story of wish-granting ""Genie"" presented as an actual event.It reminded me of ""Shantaram"", Gregory Roberts' fictionalized - and equally breathless - autobiography. It certainly makes for a pleasant reading but not an enlightening one. The author must have believed there's a sucker born every minute, and maybe he was right, as there appear to be people who believe every word in this book is accurate and true.Contrast this work with far more impressive 'Snow Leopard' by Mathiessen and Merton's ""Seven Story Mountain""."
1,No Way!,"I will have to go against the flow, here. So, some people can actually perform ""miracles"" like talking and seeing gods, teletransporting themselves, materializing objects and even entire castles out of thin air, appearing in two places at once, bringing back people from death, fighting and taming wild tigers armed with only their kindness, levitating, predicting the future, healing wounds and fatal diseases with only their will, reading minds, etc, etc? Sorry, I don't think so.I am almost finishing the book and if it were sold as a fiction piece I would give it more credit. But since it is the author's ""biography"" and all the fantastic events in it described as truth... sorry again, I just can't.As a philosophycal way of life it is still very interesting, though."
1,THE OLD 1946 VERSION IS AN EDITED VERION,"THE OLD 1946 VERSION IS AN EDITED VERSION: This edition of the Autobiography was edited by Tara Mata and the author before it was published in 1946.And before Yogananda left in 1952, He made many significant changes to the book, including the addition of the 49th chapter. In which He gave great emphasis to the importance of His life's main creation- The SELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIP. All editions are edited versions, and Yogananda's most complete work can be found in the most recent editions."
5,Autobiography of a Yogi,"I am still making my way through this book, because I want to absorb as much of the information as possible. I have been practicing yoga for several years now and thought that the book, based on its title, would educate me on what it takes to achieve the title of a yogi. Also, the various creeds throughout the world have always interested me, and this book is helping me to understand most of them at once. There are many paths, all of which lead to the same God. One of my favorite lines thus far reads, ""Man is a soul, with a body"". I highly recommend this book."
1,"One star apparently equates to ""I hate it""","I think my title sums it up. I read this book twice before attending a yogic philosophy retreat that utilized this book as the main source. I don't even know where to begin. I think people should just try to read the book and see what they get out of it. I don't want to be offensive here, particularly to people who got tons out of it, thought it was the best book ever, etc...but suffice it say, I rated it one star. I quit the hokey-pokey yoga retreat and threw the book out before I reached the parking lot."
5,Inspiring and Instructive,"The first time I read this book, I connected with only a few of the experiences it relates, and wondered about the others. Rereading it recently, I discovered that I had either experienced or witnessed *most* of the magical moments he relates. (I am currently recording that list of experiences at [...])I have also been initiated into a parallel path of Kriya Yoga (Ipsalu Tantra, which stems from the same lineage). The lessons learned on that path and the knowledge gained while on it have led me to an inescapable conclusion: I am convinced beyond a shadow of doubt that every word Yogananda speaks in this book is absolute truth."
5,Autobiography of a yogi,This is by far the best book ever written. I recommend it to anyone who wants to find God. Yogananda writes of his life and all of the miraculous experiences that he has on his journey to God.
5,Spiritually enlightening...,I have learned to appreciate other religions after reading this book. A must read and an Inspiring book for the divine seekers.
4,My Hero!,"While I found this book difficult to read the first time, the second time was easier. Be patient. Take the time to really think what this man is saying to us all. His language is beautiful, his experiences poignant. I know I will never be a gwenuine Yogi (atleast ont in this life), but the author makes the practice seem to easy and natural. If you haven't read it yet (it's 100 years old), do so now. You'll thank me later!"
1,non functioning CD's,Buyers beware. I ordered 2 copies of Autobiography of a Yogi and the CD's did NOT work.AB
2,A fantasy book not a spiritual guide,"This book is full of stories, or perhaps lies might be a better word, because nowhere is it indicated that the stories are not the truth.While there may be some valid information here of a spiritual nature (that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 0), basically it is full of b.s. about ""miracles"" the author has seen or performed himself.I found it a real turn off.I recommend most any other spiritual book over this one."
2,Damaged goods,"My gripe is not with the book, but with Geminibooks, who supplied the book. In their description they failed to mention that the book had a picture cut out of one page, which deleted the text around that page and on the back of that page. Although I did not spend a lot on the book, I would have spent more to ensure that I got the complete work."
3,Enlightened Being,"Here is the journey of a man knowing his destiny and humbly conveying this to the world in such an interesting way. I found the book absorbing, intruiging and full of wonderful stories illustrating what can be achieved through self-realization. He had a purpose of which he slowly became aware of as he evolved. He had such conviction in the Divine and was truly aligned with the Divine. It is written simply without trying to impress or convince, but just stating it as it is - wonderful!Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
5,Wonderfully Enchanting !,"This book seems like a book of fiction, so much it is unbelievable. The world of yogis is pictured in the most clarity. It make you feel as if you were there. I have always loved this lineage of the wonderful Master Babaji and this book was the instigator.For those who would like to read a different perspective of the yogis. Swami Rama's Meeting with himalayan masters is another great one."
2,Autobiography of a Yogi should only be taken for entertainment,"I bought the audio book on Audible and it is well read and somewhat interesting. But, it's total pseudoscience and supernatural fiction. If you are looking for scholarly insights into spirituality, this is not it. At times, I felt like I was being outright lied to (examples include a man who can't show up in pictures and a teleporting silver talisman to name a few). Sometimes it borders on being outright charlatan. Read it for entertainment...or not at all. There are better things to spend your time with."
1,THE TEXT IS ADULTERATED!,"You should be aware that this text of Yogananda's 1946 classic has been substantially altered by Self Realization Fellowship after the author's death. For the real McCoy, look for the edition with the blue cover issued by Crystal Clarity Press."
1,proof? evidence?,"I've read this book three times over the past 30 years. At first it changed my world. The second it reinforced my beliefs about those changes. The third time I used reason, critical thinking and applied principles of logic that one would apply to any of these claims. Now this book is not from some antiquated time - it's not the hearsay and supposition that surrounds the story of Jesus and his miracles. If these things happened, then there are witnesses. We should have corroboration on a significant scale. The entire world should stand in awe that such an individual was among us. But what I found in this reading is we only have the authors word for the events that so amazed me all those years ago. As did Carlos Castaneda. As did Lobsang Rampa. (add any Rolls Royce driving guru here) I am very grateful I discovered the power of critical thinking."
5,Simply The best,I have yet to find a better brand then Taiyo Yuden even when compaired to Verbatim. I have beta tested several dvd burning programs for about 5 years or so and Taiyo Yuden is the number one reccomended brand.
1,Coasters!!!!!!,I bought one batch of 100 and they worked great. The next batch was total CRAP!!! I'm using ImgBurn and have burned plenty of discs in the past with the exact same ISO files without problems. This pack of discs is garbage. I don't know what's going on but quality control seems to be a problem. Even the good burns that verify frequently have glitches. You have to watch every second of every video to ensure your customer won't have problems.
5,Taiyo Yuden DVDs,"These are the ONLY DVDs I use. After a LOT of research I found these to be the best quality and seem to last a long time. Cost a little more than those cheap shore bought brands, but well worth it!"
1,jvc TY are garbage,"I used to use TY all the time, perfect. Then they became ty jvc. My last batch were solid coasters, the computer would not read them after burning 80% of the time. There are some internet discussions about this. And these were the premium ones[...]"
2,Wrapped in tape,"These discs come wrapped in tape that leaves a residue on the edges of the discs. No center post to keep the discs nicely together or anything - just wrapped in tape. The exact same ones in a cake-box are cheaper. Get the ones in a cake-box. Also, the discs have some sort of flecks around the edges of the writing surface of SOME, but not all discs. To me this says the discs are not manufactured consistently - either that or maybe the tape affected them."
2,Six Days of War,"The Book is long, tedious, with WAY too much detail. I don't CARE how many cigars an Israeli leader smokes, and how many ways can the author say ""U Thant was a weak UN Secretary General""?! I got bogged down before the author even got to the war! Went on to another, more fast paced novel and will go back to Six Days again sometime. It's just impossible to read the whole thing straight through.....at least I found it so!"
3,Hopeless military jumble,"Why do authors think we know how many men are in an Israeli or Syrian battilion? How many of us have intimate knowledge of topography? This book has an interesting diplomatic story to tell which it does with some skill, but the military part is just a mess. Maps-more than two-drawings and some semse of descriptive ability besides just a list of place names would go a long way towards making this book more interesting. The most stunning part of the book is how Arab propaganda permitted Israel to keep fighting because the arabs were loath to admit how badly the first day of the war went. You reap what you sow.."
4,very good documentary for this war,I have enjoyed reading this period as I lived it as a child living in Israel. I will purchase the vedeo as well. It is very important to write about this war and its causes.
4,Needs more synthesizing,"Accurate, detailed, long, too long. All the information you need and more is here, put in chronological order, from all sides, the planning and the making, the would-be's and the were, the personal interviews and recollections and the reporting. But it reads more as a police report than as an author book.When it dwells into diplomacy and he-said and the other-said, its interests plummets, it becomes boring and frustrating. It's a huge work of collecting data all right, doing interviews to tens of people, etc, but I think readers would appreciate a more synthesized book than this one. Be specific, get to the point, don't just pour information like from a broken faucet. The author may use this as a lecture tool or as a text book in some college course, but for the general audience it's not fun."
4,informative,It is very detailed and seemed to be fairly balanced. Not a book for non history buffs.I thought it was worth reading.
2,technical book for true historians,I thought this would be an interesting book on the subject war. It was way to historical for me. A history buff would love it.
3,Good Behind the Scenes,"This book adds another dimension to the Six Days War. A lot of detail as to the politics on the various sides of this war. Would recommend to the person who is serious about history. I found this book a good read in light of recent events in the Middle East.A bit pro Israeli but, nonetheless, adds some interesting dimensions as to the critical situation the region was in at the time and the tenuous position of Israel."
4,A detailed look at Mid-East War,"The author's knowledge of the subject matter is evident throughout the book. While the book covers both the political and military aspects of the war, the author's strength clearly lies in his intimate knowledge of the Israeli political system. Many of the chapters take the reader into the inner chambers of the Israeli political and military command. The book is politically balanced, but the author did not appear to have the same level of access for the Arab side as he did for the Israeli. As a result a larger percentage of the book describes the how Israel dealt with the crisis. It was amazing to read how many of today's major Mid-East leaders, where also involved in the 1968 war."
4,Great Book,"The book was a great way to learn about what happened in those days leading to the war, the war and the aftershocks. The book was never dull (impressive for a ""history"" book!) and I highly recommend it."
4,Pause to think,This book does a great job of trying to give a broad picture of the context leading up to the war and the circumstances each player faced during it. At times it is a little confusing to follow places and players and slightly labor's its record of the last few days before the conflict broke into war. Yet it remains overall a gripping and insightful read into this war. Well worth the read!
3,"4 Stars for the book, 2 stars for Kindle version.","The bulk of the book focuses on the events leading to the 1967 war. Also contains a brief history of the state of Israel and a section dealing with the aftermath. As is perhaps fitting for a war that lasted only six days, the chapters detailing the actual combat make up a relatively small portion of the book.Thoroughly researched with an extensive bibliography and footnotes, at times becomes dry and scholarly. A slight pro-Israeli slant seems to come from lack of resources from the Arab countries involved rather than bias on the part of the author. U.S. and Soviet sources are used as well.The Kindle version of the book is marred by typos and formatting errors. Maps are not optimized for the Kindle and are nearly impossible to read."
5,Political and military history at its best,"I was 40 years old at the time of the Six-day war and in IDF uniform. On the Saturday after the war I was wondering under what circumstances Israel (my cherished home since 1940) will get rid of the Sinai, the ""triangle"" (Judea and Samaria) and the Golan. So, I admit being a dove.With infinite patience, after hundreds of hours of research, Oren has put togethere the best overall political history of the period, the detailed events of the war and its terrible aftermath. The book is coolheaded, fair, comprehensive and stands out as a gem in its genre. The first 170 pages deal with the background, about 100 with the events of six days and the rest, about 30, are an excellent epilogue. Very highly recommended to friend and foe alike."
1,Outdated,"This book is outdated and contains many formerly believed myths about the 1967 war. Previously classified Johnson administration documentation was released from the U.S. State Department Office of the Historian in January 2004, which clearly proves that Israel attacked Eqypt even though Egypt was trying to avoid war using shuttle diplomacy. Most historians have not updated their work to reflect the diplomatic realities that have been documented during the days before the war, and this book is one of them.The book is great fictional story-telling for people who want to build Israeli nationalistic pride, but I would not recommend it if you are a serious historian."
1,Out of Date Israeli Propaganda,"In June 3, 2003 Presidio published Oren's ""history"" on the '67 War.On January 12, 2004 the US State Department released diplomatic cables and previously classified Johnson era communications which debunk an entire generation of Israeli propaganda masquerading as ""history"".To see the real facts about the ""heroic"" Israeli preemption, see the book ""Deadly Doctrine""[...]It'll change the way you think about so-called ""first strikes""."
3,Israeli Labor party revision of history - cra...,"Basically, the book is smth btw socialist party version of the war and ""mestechko"" attitude, i.e. great Ben Gurion, great Rabin, great socialist kibbutzniks, etc. Heroic, dramatic, non-willing to fight with Israel Naser, reluctant Soviet vultures, resisting ""Palestinian"" terrorists, etc.Major disappointment with all the hupla around the book!!!! Not worth its money, well I would buy it for a shakel or so :)"
4,six days of reading until the war even starts,"Much preamble and lead-up in this account of the 6 day war, although I suppose one can't fault the author for being thorough. Nevertheless, it was 6 days of reading until the first shot was fired. But, if you want a blow by blow of this event this is a good book. Analyses of each leader's personality, strengths, weaknesses and philosophy is provided. Also, I was struck by how little the positions and mind-sets of the various governments have changed; after 45 years we are no closer to peace in the middle east than we were in 1967."
4,A six day Arab-Israel War,"The title of this book is mildly misleading. The book dissects the political realities underlying the war, the politics guiding the war and the political aftermath of the war. While the actual combat is discussed, there are only a few very small maps that are difficult to read even with a magnifying glass and there is nothing remotely resembling an order of battle. It's worth reading for a understanding of the politics but don't expect to learn much about the actual battles."
3,slow reading,"The book is good, but tedious reading. Names of people and places slow you down. I have put it aside twice to read other books and will finish it soon Worth the read."
5,extremely comprohensive,"Oren covers the Six Day war in great depth in this book. He starts out by focuing on the early history of Israel and how it got along with the superpowers like America, UK and the USSR as well as with its neighbors showing their interests in Israel and previous armed conflicts. The book then goes into the evnts leading upto the six day war such as troop diplomant and Arab concern over Dinoma's nuclear power. Then Oren covers each day of the war, looking at how each country fought and alliances created. The book also deals with how Europe, America and the USSR influence events in the region. It deals with military strategy and political and military outcomes. Oren then ends with how the SIx day war affected the Middle East and contininuing problems with the Middle East"
1,"Better, un-biased Books are Available","Unfortunately, Mrs Pride's biased ideas prevent this book from being helpful for most home schooling families. She neglects a wealth of resources for her own reasons and negatively reviews other resources without an objective eye for truth. I have homeschooled 7 children for 11 years. I have rarely found this book helpful in all those years."
1,Alien Vengeance,The movie may or may not have had a good plot but the sound tract is so bad that I could not sit through the entire film. In order to hear the actor's words the sound has to be turned up so incredibly loud that when the 'mood' music comes in it blasts you out of your chair.
5,An EXCELLENT simple book to clear up the many myths,"This is a clearly written FACT filled book that presents a myth or commen misconception about the arab-israel conflict and then presents the facts about the case, in this way it forms a wonderful reference to look up commen things youll hear in the media and elsewhere."
5,HAMAS in their own words,"It's always great to go back to the original sources when reading a book and I have with many of the references included here. That's why, I can't really rate this book highly enough. It provides you with a wealth of Arab, Israeli, European and American source content. The references and research are excellent and the layout of the work makes it easy to read and digest. I found the appendixes including letters from Rabin and Arafat to be interesting as well as the HAMAS charter. Considering the current Palestinian elections, it interesting to read about HAMAS and their goals from their own words and charter. For anyone researching the middle east or interested in getting to know more about the historical roots of the Palestine-Israel conflict, this is a great starting point."
1,amazing,"This is an ideal primer for anyone who is serious about the study of manipulation by media. I simply tells one side of a complex story, and it is disturbing that some readers may accept these ""facts""."
5,25 Chapters of TRUTH,"A highly useful guide to the facts, and rebuttal of the usual anti-semitic propaganda peddled by islamic and radical-leftists politics. The book is divided into 25 chapters, stating the propagandist myth, followed by a thorough but brief essay on the actual historical truth of the selected topic.A sampling of the subjects within:-the 1948 war-the 1967 Six day war-the 1973 Yom Kippur war-refugees-treatment of Jews in Arab/islamic societies-human rights in Arab countries ...(NONE!)-Palestinian uprisings-Arab/muslim attitudes toward IsraelIsrael is a valiantly defended island against a vast, hostile, genocidal sea. By their guile and heroic skill at arms, the Israelis are still alive and well. The surrounding nations invaded many times, and failed miserably, despite greatly out-numbering Israeli forces. This book is the rational truth dispelling all the hysterical media lies."
4,Beautiful but lacking......,"I specifically wanted this book to help me with my vegetable container garden. There's a very SMALL section about tomatoes, eggplants, and strawberries that wasn't much help. Other than that, the book is beautiful. If I was striving for a gorgeous flower container garden, I'd definitley buy this book."
5,There Once Was A Sky Full Of Stars is a must,"There Once Was A Sky Full Of Stars is a fabulous children's book, and one of a kind. Adults too, enjoy reading it. Bob Crelin wrote this book in such a way that you do not realize it is filled with such important information until you put it down. Then, you are ready to read it again. It is written extremely well, there is great a rhythm to the book, the story is awesome, and the illustrations are terrific. It is a fun read, and kids love it."
5,Endearing and educational - meaningful to kids AND adults,"This book is lovingly written. The illustrations accompany the text beautifully, with realistic depictions of dark skies and light polluted skies. If you look carefully, there are whimsical touches to every illustration, and children will not tire of looking for new suprises on each page. Most importantly, Mr. Crelin's message is articulated in a way that is meaningful and thought-provoking. This book is a ""must"" for every child's bookshelf, and will excite children about searching for treasures in the night sky. ""There Once Was a Sky Full of Stars"" will quickly become a bedtime favorite. Widespread availability of this book will feed children's curiosity about the universe, and instill important awareness and sense of responsibility for our planet."
1,"Full screen, really DVD bad transfer, and mediocre movie","So, as others have said this DVD is Fullscreen (when I placed my order the product page still mistakenly said widescreen) and the video transfer is horrendous even for an 80's movie with many scenes out of focus and lots of dust and grain on the picture as if someone just video taped the movie for the DVD from a poor projection screen. The story on top of that is also pretty mediocre but I'm glad to finally have it again to show the kids."
1,The reviews on this item are wrong,"I don't disagree with the reviews as they are written for the movie made from the television series. However, this movie was never part of the television series. This was a poor (extremely poor) attempt at telling the Lone Ranger story. Released in 1981, this movie forced Clayton Moore from his mask to dark sunglasses and made the one flop wonder Klinton Spilsbury a hated man among Lone Ranger fans. This movie gives all of the credit of creating the Lone Ranger to Tonto, even to the point of using a silver bullet, as the Lone Ranger could not shoot straight without silver in the bullets. In the end, even Christopher Lloyd as the bad guy couldn't save this movie. In the case of Amazon attaching all of the good reviews for the Clayton Moore movie to this poor attempt at story telling, Amazon has blown it big time. Do not waste your money on this movie."
3,Good story but poorly produced,"The story line of ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" is a classic. The Lone Ranger is an old western folk hero, so how come it wasn't given more credit with a top class cast, better than average cinema and a more serious approach. Look at what Christopher Nolan has done with Batman, so why can't someone do the same for the Lone Ranger. The DVD quality is appalling. But with all that, it is still a good movie to get into."
3,Wrong movie,"This is the infamous 1981 version of Legend of the Lone Ranger, not any episodes of the classic TV show. I remember seeing this as a kid. There is a certain camp value to this goofy movie. It was nowhere nearly as interesting as the controversy involving Clayton Moore wearing his mask in public. The producers of this movie wanted Moore not to wear it so they could get a new actor to play the part. The whole thing backfired and the movie bombed. Still, this movie is a curiosity item and maybe entertaining because of it."
1,An Astonishing Rip-Off,"I wanted to give this much-maligned picture a shot and see if it offered the fun of Dino's underrated Flash Gordan picture. However, this full-screen DVD's transfer is so dreadful I couldn't even finish watching it. It's astonishingly cynical that this shameful product would be be sold at regular prices to the Ranger's huge fan base without even a cursory attempt to restore the image."
1,Who Played That Masked Man?,"Klinton Spilsbury became the answer to a trivia question in this incredibly dull 1981 revival of the legendary masked rider. A misguided script and plodding direction are the main culprits. The origin of the Lone Ranger can be summed up in a few minutes, yet the movie takes forever to get started. John Barry's uninspired score is further hampered by a ludicrous ""ballad"" from Merle Haggard. The producers could have saved a fortune by reissuing the Clayton Moore-Jay Silverheels theatrical features from the 1950s - all infinitely superior to this big-budget fiasco."
3,"""It could have been a contender...but...""","""As I purchsed my ticket to view this film back in 1982, I thought I was going to spend a thrilling trip back to Saturday afternoon adventure: yes, the photography was very crisp, and breath taking,the plot was almost clever in the re-telling of how the ""masked man"" came to be, even the Native American was treated with a refreshing respect of a noble race...but even Christopher Lloyd, Jason Robards, and Michael Horse could not help put Mr. Spilsbury's character together again...""It could have been a contender...but the actor(s)have a responsiblity to portray a character(s) that will convince the audience of the validity, sincerety, believeabilty of that character"". No where in the pages of history will I find a greater champion of justice like ""Clayton Moore and Jay Silver Heels"",at least the language in Moore's films were family oriented...If you like wonderful scenery you'll like this film but buyer beware...""it isn't the Lone Ranger""!"
1,"Never saw, never will","I don't care if this won 4 Oscars, I will never watch it or the new one with Johnny Depp as Tonto....HAHAHA that's a good one. #1, the first remake took the mask from Clayton Moore. #2, there is only one Lone Ranger and always will be, and that's Clayton Moore. I doubt the other imposters could carry that persona. Mr. Moore and his tv character is a hero and role model for us baby-boomers. Sad, sad day when he passed. Those days of yesteryear were the best and they'll never come back again, unfortunately. Just look at today's society.....depressing. Ah well, Hi-Yo Silver Away!!!"
3,"Great Flick, Bad Transfer","Briefly, Amazon has had this up for a brief time showing that it is a WIDESCREEN presentation with a theatrical ratio of 1:33:1, and those two facts are in direct conflict. To clarify this is NOT widescreen; this film has been modified to fit the screen. Had Amazon listed this properly, I probably would not have purchased it as I'm much of a cinema purist and would have preferred a full widescreen theatrical presentation (black bars and all) ... there are sections of the DVD transfer that are extraordinarily grainy, which is also a disappointment as I'm sure it couldn't have cost the studio that much to clean this up a bit. Still, having been one of the few folks who comfortably admit to seeing this in its original theatrical run (I saw it several times), I'm glad some version of this is finally available on DVD."
4,One of my Guilty Pleasures,"I remember watching The Lone Ranger with my Father and when the movie came out, I was excited to relive that feeling. I thought the movie was a good retelling of the origion story and that it gave John Reid/Lone Ranger more of a human feel and that I could relate with him. I know that others didn't like the film, but I can still watch the film and feel like a kid again with it. I almost feel like yelling ""High-Yo Silver, Away"" everytime I hear the William Tell Overture. It's one of my personal favorites."
1,disappointment,"Firstly, I'm a Clayton Moore/Jay Silverheels fan... That being said, I saw this film on cable with new folks in the title roles and considered it interesting. Ordered the dvd. THAT was a disappointment.. full frame when it should have been wide screen. A really lousy, grainy transfer... more like a bootleg vhs copy. No excuse for that these days. If this ever gets released in wide screen with a new transfer, I might buy it again... THIS particular DVD was not worth even the low price."
3,Kid Again,I'm alot older now and when I was a kid I loved The Lone Ranger. All the movie critics can say what they want about the movie (which is mostly negative). The bottom line is that when the Lone Ranger puts on his mask I feel like a kid again and that works for me.
1,BAD BAD BAD FAITH,"I don't know if this has been addressed in the other reviews, but when this movie came out (I remember it like it was yesterday) the filmmakers took out a court injunction against Clayton Moore to prevent him from wearing the mask in public (appearances, conventions, etc.) as it would interfere with the new film. For this reason I've never seen it and never will. The producers will not get a dime from me ... EVER."
5,Great remake of the old series,This is a great movie. I liked the old series as a kid. It was good idea making this movie. It definitely does the Lone Ranger justice.
2,"Sorry folks, but this movie bites.....","For starters, the film wastes an entire hour with the setup of how The Lone Ranger became The Lone Ranger. That's 60 minutes out of a 95 minute movie!!! They just show scene after boring scene of the ultra boring Lone Ranger and his brother not doing much of anything until they are ambushed by Cavandish. Then we don't even know what the bad guy is up to until the last 15 minutes! Then we have Klinton Spilsbury, who has all the screen presence of a cabbage. I would like to know how the hell he got this part in the first place. It's no wonder he didn't make another film.I give this movie an extra star because of Christopher Lloyd, who is surprisingly good as the icy villain Cavandish. It's too bad he didn't get more screentime, because unlike Spilsbury, Lloyd can actually act."
1,Plain Awful!,"This is one of the dullest, slowest, most insipid, most boring, most rotten dialogue movies ever made. The poetry narration is assinine, too. What a piece of junk. Glad I got it out of the library so didn't have to pay a cent to see it."
2,"""Hi-yo stupid""","Was looking forward to the DVD release--but its a dud. I loved the Lone Ranger as a kid but the biggest problem with this movie (among many) is that actors/characters just take themselves WAY too seriously. When you read that all of Klinton Spilsbury's lines were dubbed (by the actor James Keach)and he never did another film after this you can see why. The Tonto character isn't bad but they had to throw in some 80's 'politically correct' dialogue into this film which kind of spoils the whole thing. To be fair how can you make an intersting hero out of the Lone Ranger in modern times, when he only wounds bad guys when he uses his gun? Watching this film you realize the reason a lot of movies take a long time to be released on DVD is they're lousey movies to begin with."
2,He's not Clayton Moore,"Overlooking the fact that he's not Clayton Moore and will never be as good, the movie is a slightly better than average western. It's a total shame that it was only released in full screen in a bad transfer format. A digitally remastered Wide Screen edition would have been great. As it is, don't waste your money."
2,NOT the classic TV version...,"Unfortunately, if you're buying this version with the idea that you'll be treated to the adventures of Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, you'll be sorely disappointed. this is the early 80's cinematic take on the Lone Ranger, starring Klinton Spilsbury -- and actor so bad his dialouge had to be dubbed by another actor in post-production. Skip this unless you are a really big fan of the Lone Ranger, or a really big fan of crap cinema."
5,Great,I watched this movie years ago and looked for it for years. I was very pleased with the quality and also with the speed that i received the movie.
3,"Good quality printer, with a few faults","This printer has outstanding print quality when printing photosand graphics. It's print speed is decent, and it doesn't take up muchroom on your desk. The faults are all print cartridge related. First of all only one cartridge in at a time, so either you have the color cartridge in, or the black cartridge. Lexmark helped this problem by including a cartridge caddy on the back of the printer to store a cartridge that's not being used. The second problem is the cartridges are pretty expensive. For a $90 printer, the black cartridge is $28.99 here, and around $32 retail. Color is about $5 more. Pretty steep for a cheap printer. And unlike Epson or HP printers, you can't get generic Lexmark cartridges, so you can't save any money that way. The software is good, it talks to you and tells you what the printer is doing. 1200dpi photo quality is amazing. Just be ready to shell out the cash when your ink cartridge runs out. END"
5,Good printer,"I've got this printer as Xmas present. Nice looking thing. Also it says on its box, that is 1200x1200 resolution makes it bigger resolution on the earth, (printers of its class). seems to be good printer. But printing quite slow... I've tried print color photo 600x720 pix with 1200x1200 max resolution, its took about 4,3 min to finish. Finnaly output is Really good. Of course text printing is much faster. So if you need to print text, its a great choise. If you need photo-like output this one is still good. Unless you going to use it for news-paper or magazin printing :). Bottomline: Buy it, for home use."
1,Several problems,"I bought this printer a couple of months ago and while the setup went very smooth, I have encountered a few problems. First, the printer can only use one cartridge at a time and while it prints color pages beautifully, the black text is not too sharp when using the color cartridge and such a hassle to switch between two cartridges. Also, a few people have noted the price of the replacement cartridges... $35 for color and $30 for black. Don't bother looking for generic cartridges like the ones for Epsons and Canons cause there aren't any. The other problem with the printer is the way the sheets feed into it. Sometimes, two or three pages will feed into it and it will throw off the other pages already in the feeder, so you can't really leave the computer while you're printing out a 10 page report. As for the cheap cost of the printer, don't even fall for it. It's all a cheap ploy for Lexmark to force you into buying $35 ink cartridges for years to come."
2,Z11 not for me,"I've had my Z11 for abt. 2 yrs., it came w/my puter. The black printed ok but the color photos weren't very good. I'm lookin to buy another printer cause this one was slow, noisy, & has already broke down several times. It did give on screen info abt. ink levels, selection of print sizes, etc. Not impressed."
1,Be Very Very Careful,"...the printer comes without a Parallel Port Cable, making it more expensive and and timely to order, since Amazon.com does not carry the cable.If it looks too good to be true, it may not be. I may well return this and ask for my money back."
3,slow but lasted a while,"I had this printer for 4 years....it's great for basic stuff. but I now have a digital camera, and found a printer where I can insert the memory card from my digital camera and upload my pics easier.this printer is kinda slow, only 4 pages per minute....but, the quality is good, and it didn't need any service in 4 years.great for everyday usebut now that i'm getting into photos....I needed a better printer"
2,DON'T BUY IT,"Very slow. If it were 4 ppm black and white, I wouldn't complain . It is slow and the picture quality is poor( I compared it to my dad's z23 and my sister's canon bjc2100- the bjc2100 wasn't very good, but the z11 is worse ). For this price, there are better options, so keep searching-unless you want your neighbours looking out their windows whenever you are using your printer."
1,Waste of Money,"Loud, problematic, and messy. You need to purchase true black ink, since it only comes with color. Also, you can only use one ink cartridge at a time. I've had nothing but problems with this printer!"
2,"Cheap, for sure, but flawed","I was elated to find this ""gem"" on sale at a big-box discount chain. Not needing a printer too often, I figured this would be a great deal. The printing quality was very good and operation was relatively simple, but cartridges were a killer, even for as seldom as I printed. Note too that users must switch between color cartridges and black frequently, otherwise the color variety is wasted quickly. This model conked out in only two years of light use."
5,A fresh fun mystery series,"Fun, clean easy read. If you like Mary Higgins Clark you will like Edie Claire is and her loveable Leigh Koslow also."
3,A good summer read,"Leigh's Aunt is acting suspicious. She breaks a leg while leaving her pastor's burning house. The pastor claims that she saved his life. Then he is found dead in mysterious circumstances. Various parishoners are receiving messages from the beyond encouraging them to give money to the dead pastor's pet charity. They all thought Humphrey was a con man, but a con ghost?I enjoyed this mystery. The characters were quirky enough to be entertaining and the subplots and mystery were excellent."
4,"Good book, some reviews have spoilers","I enjoyedNever Preach Past Noon (Leigh Koslow Mystery Series). It tells the tale of a charismatic minister who is not what he seems. Leigh Koslow and her quirky family collaborate in their own unique way to solve the mystery. It was a light, quick read with a nice atmosphere and a satisfying ending.If you write reviews, I hope you'll be careful not to give away plot twists and outcomes. Fortunately, before I read this book, I did NOT read the reviews here that contain spoilers. If spoilers without warnings bother you, you might want to skip otherwise well-written reviews by moe811, kellytwo, and klausner."
4,Let me explain,"I gave this book 4 stars when I have given some truly great writers less BUT it is because this book is exactly what is professes to be. This is a light, slightly smart, quirky little mystery. It's not up for an Edgar or Shamus. The Silver Dagger committee wont be calling BUT it is what it is--a charming, weird little book about murder."
1,Worthless,There is nothing in the amazingly short document that you couldn't find in a 10 second google search.
4,"Leaves' Eyes : ""Vinland Eyes""","If you enjoyed ""Lovelorn"", you'll probably enjoy this even more. I know I did. It's got a heavier feel to it than ""Lovelorn"" does, the vocals are also more interesting, and easier to follow as well. This is beautifully produced as well...That's just my take, but it seems as if Leaves' Eyes have finally found the sound and direction that works, and here on ""Vinland Eyes"", they've taken another step forward. Big things are instore for this band in the near future. ENJOY!!!...."
4,Norway begins here,"The Norwegian chanteuse Liv Kristine Espenaes-Krull has finally and fully grown up: On 'Vinland Saga', we hear her voice in so multiple facets like never before. Once tender and longing(Elegy), another time powerful-demanding (New Found Land) or sunken in dreams full of melancholy, if not even sadness (Leave's Eyes): the former Theatre of Tragedy singer appears in her best condition. As multiple as her voice are the guitars: from hard and heavy to accoustic sounds: All is offered. I am not sure if we may call this CD a contribution to Gothic metal: Too much folk influences are present, and the keyboards and samples stay in the background. There is only one aspect that makes me refuse the highest rating possible: Alex Krull simply cannot resist grunting. But at least he limits himself in this respect to two short passages in two songs (Nr. 4 and 6). His qualities as a producer, however, are more than obvious."
4,The voyage continues...,"Leaves' Eyes take another bound closer to major success with ""Vinland Saga"", growing in songwriting and recording ability. Their sound and attitude has also grown, melding the glorious riffs that littered ""Lovelorn"" with a grander, epic melody that supports Liv Kristine's developing, fuller vocal style. Beautifully childlike atop the power of ""Lovelorn"", Liv's vocals on ""Vinland Saga"" have attained a new maturity and range that is nothing short of breathtaking.Anyone who liked their last album will be enthralled. Anyone who likes melodic powerful metal will love it. The girls are taking over: just keep you eye on the likes of Liv, Cristina Scabbia and the wonderful Octavia Sperati. The future's looking damned good!"
4,Stirring combination of beautiful vocals and rock,"I'm a huge fan of the ultradramatic gothic band Nightwish with their awesome combination of female vocals and rock but a lot of my friends find them TOO dramatic.Leave's Eyes is the perfect alternative this ocean journey themed cd is pretty but not sickly sweet,it rocks but doesn't pound you into the ground.Like the perilous journey it evokes in the songs it strikes the perfect balance between beauty and adventure.Individual songs are very good but listening to the complete cd at once is an exhilerating experience."
2,Rare highlights,"Even if this husband and wife Euro-goth-metal duo are touted as a better Evanescence or Lacuna Coil, it does not really say much when the huge majority of material still cannot escape so many of the genre cliches that keeps it just about as disinteresting as their companions."
5,Amazing artist,I encountered Vineland Saga quite by chance and was amazed at their ability to mix Liv Kristine Espens amazing vocal talent with a totally unheard of brand of gothic rock. I absolutly adored this CD and I think that to anyone who has appreciation for melodic rock or a beautiful singing voice to amazing rock music would adore this CD too. The CD seems to tell a story (although lyrics are hard to come by online) and that just adds an extra element of interest to it.
3,Good but not really their music,"As many others have written, yes this cd shows they are very good musicians as far as playing technically and fast goes BUT!!!!!! the more i listen the more riffs from other bands i recognize. ""We're all to blame"" was the first song i heard and immediately said...this part sounds like a System of a Down song. Sure enough more songs had similar riffs. ""I'm not the one"" clearly rips off Linkin Park. And the biggest rip off is ""the bitter end"". MetallicA might as well be singing this song. If this isn't almost exactly like ""Battery"" I don't know what is. The solos sound just like the master Kirk Hammet, the chord progressions make me think I'm listening to Master of Puppets. I think Sum really has talent but they need a bit more originality when it comes to writing. If you are expecting the greatest cd ever you will truly be disappointed. If you are looking for a bunch of remixes and remakes of a previously released songs from other bands you should buy this."
2,meh,"I find it hilarious that people suggested that the editorial reviewer should be fired for presenting an opinion that was disagreed with. Opinions, people.This Sum 41 album is mediocre at best, no matter how much more seriously they take themselves, their music is still paper thin. There is nothing original about their ""new"" sound. I wish that if bands were going to reinvent themselves, they would actually invent.Edit: I'd also like to note Sum 41's shameless rip-off of the riff from 'The Scientist' by Coldplay, on their song 'Pieces'."
2,Inspiration or Plagiarism?,"It's nice that Sum 41 is adding a bit of metal flavor into their sound and all, but do they need to resort to outright rip-offs of other bands? I mean, the oh-so-clever reference to ""Master of Puppets"" in the acoustic intro would have been acceptable had they not completely stolen the chorus and chord progressions from the classic ""Battery"" from the same album on ""The Bitter End"". That's really about as close as you can get to copying a song without getting sued. The ending might as well be note-for-note.Sorry, but I'm not paying to listen to recycled music."
2,Like Terrible Music?,"Nice job Sum! You switched your style. Only problem is NOW IT STINKS! If your looking to buy the new Sum 41 CD in hopes of finding the old catchy pop-punk glory your used to, you may be let down. Sum 41 changed their genre to some hard rock ish (don't really know what ish means but in this case it's not good). I bought this cd the day it came out and was extremely let down. Listened to it one time all the way through and then i retired it from my CD collection. Not good. I do not recommend. If I did have to choose the best song though, it would be track 2 (I didn't take the time to look at the song names)."
2,"it's okay, but...","OH MY GOD!!!what the hell is wrong with sum 41?! these guys suck!!""chuck"" is not the best, but pieces and were all to blame are pretty good. the rest just sucks. BLINK-182 AND GREEN DAY ARE BETTER!!"
1,N'Stynk with instruments,"I'll start off by saying that I dont hate these guys as much as I hate Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, but they still suck! Oh...so...tired...falling...asleep...(snore)...(snore)........................................................................................................................................Oh huh! Okay, I took a nap because of how boring this album was in the backround, I thought I'd play it while I was writing this review so I could write exactly how I felt about it and what do you know! I fell asleep! Thats how boring and cheesy this is. JUST DONT BUY THIS, PLEASE!"
3,You should chuck this CD,"There's nothing with getting more serious with your music as you age. I mean, you can't always sing about chicks and skateboarding. But, this just doesn't seem to fit Sum 41 and the image they created. It's too quick of a depature. It's like that friend you have who goes to college their freshman year and then come back after a semester ""civilized"". They criticize your coffee, and are now ""above"" acting like a kid. Too fast Sum 41, too fast."
5,"""Sumthing"" Praise Worthy Here","This album couldn't possibly go down in flames. Sum-41 has officially separated themselves from the crowd. They stand out with their own version of music that sounds so much like the classic punk bands of yesterdaY! Trust me, that is a great thing and I'm positive here! It's a very short, but concise album that makes great points about politics and conformity. I also like how it was named after the guy ""Chuck"" who had saved Sum's lives after a on location documentary went chaotic. This is not sloppy all-the-same-like-the-others-they-basically-suck band anymore, nor does their music sound mediocre. This music just WORKS. If you don't like it, you have problems. Vist myspace.com and join today too."
5,awsome,this is sum 41's best cd and the three bonus tracks are very good and any sum 41 or non sum 41 fac should buy. and you should also join their fan clup at [...]. so buy this awsome cd
3,Not their best,"Sum 41 has truly been the epitome of a band who has traveled through pretty much every stage of rock. Their All Killer No Filler album appeared to be the catchiest album, featuring more ""pop punk"" hits such as ""Motivation,"" ""Fat Lip,"" and ""In Too Deep."" In their next album, a more serious atmosphere had surrounded most of the songs. However, the melodious chord quality that was in their first album was still present in their second album, and blended with the dose of alternative that I think made their Does This Look Infected CD their best album. When I popped in their Chuck CD, I was not surprised that Sum 41 had taken a step further in incorporating more metal aspects into their music. I myself am not a big heavy metal fan, but I can connect with most of the songs on this album. Although this album is not their best, I would recommend at least listening to it."
5,GREAT JOB SUM 41!!,"i really could care less what genre they are. Does it really matter if its just good music? My god too many people have to make sure they are ""cool"" by sticking to one genre. Listen to what you want to, not what others want you too. This CD was definately worth the 10.00 i payed for it. Highly recommended, even if you are new to SUM 41's style. The CD has pretty much all i want, i can listen to some emo, or listen to some songs i can headbang too haha. GO GET IT YOU WILL BE HOOKED!!"
4,CD is good but..,"The CD is good but the product came open, didn't care that much since CD condition was perfect but, so... the hell with it.."
1,garbage,"Sum 41 is on the way out. They are a washed up pop punk band, and this album is a last ditch attempt to make some more money before the clock runs out, and they have to go back to their jobs at the local ""Burger King"" fast food establishment.Their popularity is going downhill because they are a flavour of the month novelty act. Their fans are simply getting tired of the band. These guys have about as much staying power as the Spice Girls or Hanson. Remember those groups? Thats where Sum 41 will be in another year or two.I can't recommend this CD to anybody. The only reason to buy this CD is if you want to waste your money."
4,A Worthy Successor To 'Does This Look Infected?',"This is an awesome album. 'Pieces' was a good song, until radio basically ruined it by playing it every 5 minutes, but there are plenty other great songs, my favorite being 'No Reason.' As always, a very short disk, about 39 minutes, which made me wish they would have just added more songs."
3,The editorial review is right...,"There is ALOT of ripping-off of other bands on this CD. Theres that Linkin Park ripoff, System Of A Down ripoff (even though it ends up sounding much better than SOAD), a ripoff of Oasis AND Sum 41's old song Handle This in ""Some Say"", and alot of Metallica ripoffs. But still, this CD is listenable. We're All To Blame is definetly a great song."
2,Mislead,"I saw Sum 41 perform ""Pieces"" on David Letterman and was in awe of the bands performance. I ordered Chuck the next day, but was very disappointed that the rest of the CD was (in my book) hard core, thrash music. Nothing else on the CD even close to ""Pieces."" Too bad they didn't write more songs like that one because they have tons of talent going to waste."
2,unoriginal and uninspired,"nothing new here...if you like 'pieces', listen to coldplay's 'the scientist' which it is ripped off of"
5,A wonderful classical music album,"Sum 41 is one of the best classical music groups of the 21st century. When I saw them live, their interpretations of Mozart and Beethoven were magnificent and unique. Grandma and Grandpa will surely love this album!"
5,Great CD,"So-called ""Punk"" bands like Good Charlotte are polluting the industry - The fact is sum 41's CD isn't amazing, but as far as punk goes today it's awesome. Some of the songs are ""heavily inspired"" by other bands, but hey! I'd still prefer be listening to this guys instead of good charlotte.I hope they continue in this direction - they can only get better. I still think does this look infected was their best though."
5,CHUCK ON TOP,Chuck is exactly what I was expecting from these guys after the Congo incident. We're All To Blame is amazing and is supported by a cast of other great songs all of which are worthy of being singles!
4,NOT POP,Please do not call this cd punk pop. This is not to be put on the same level as some kiddy band like simple plan. This stuff is good. It actually ROCKS. It has a beat that sometimes goes even louder than the Ramones so you who catagorize this band in pop insult my music taste. I was looking at catagorys and they put on that level. It kills me.
3,pretty good...ripped off MetallicA though,"I liked this cd up until the bitter end, which I heard from some friends was the best song on the album. To my suprise, it was a rather shameless MetallicA ripoff, with the vocals, solo, and riffs ripped off from ""battery"" and riffs stonlen from ""blackened"" and ""trough the never"" (download those three songs and prove me wrong). Anyways, all I can say is, cool album guys, a bit les poppy than your last one, just try to be a bit more original next time k?"
3,Ok,"This album really is OK, it's quite boring though. I don't like how sum 41 copied other bands on their songs, like how they copied Linkin Park on ""No Reason"" (even though I hate LP), Metallica on ""Bitter End"", Coldplay on ""Pieces"" (according to previous reviewer) and System of a Down on ""We're All To Blame"".If they came up with some original stuff I'd give them a better chance."
3,"If you like this band and album, follow these instructions!","First listen to The Bitter End carfully, let the song sink in. Then, if you can, download the Metallica song Battery and listen to it closely. I you like the second one a lot better, buy the Master of Puppets album and forget about ""Chuck"". The only truly positive thing I can say about this album is the Sum 41 picked the greatest band of all time to rip-off. At least they have good music taste..."
1,Down hill to Hell,"When Sum 41 kicked off their careers with the albums, ""Half Hour of Power"" and ""All Killer No Filler"" I thought that they would be easily the next big thing. Since ""Does this look infected?"" however, I've changed my mind. Chuck is quite possibly one of the worst albums ever released by a pop punk band. Where most songs are not even close to technically appealing, most are downright bad. For instance, the song, ""Pieces"" is simply a ripoff with even the same chord progression format as Coldplay's ""The Scientist"". Sum 41 either needs to get original or get out because another album like this and I will lose all faith in the bands that the modern music industry is promoting."
2,not really bad but not good either,"Ok first off let me start by saying I am new to Sum 41. I never heard any other of their previous albums and after listening to this one, I don't really have the desire to do so. It is true that Sum 41 copied a lot of other bands on Chuck but that doesn't really matter to me. If a band plays good and makes good music I don't really care how or from who they got their ideas. I didn't really like the album mostly becuase I don't like their style of music. Almost all the tracks sound the same, you can't tell one from another. Also, most of the tracks have beats that are too fast for my liking. I only enjoyed 4 tracks on the album: 5, 8, 11, 12. Personally I like Yellowcard's Ocean Avenue much better."
4,Another good album from Sum,"If you are a fan of Sum 41, then their newest album shouldn't disappoint. This album is pretty similar to their last album ""Does this look infected"" (DTLI) as it has some heavy guitar riffs and fast-paced punk-sometimes bordering on metal. There is also some rapping in the verses of some of the songs like in DTLI. However, this album has some slower, more mellow songs unlike DTLI. So, if you liked Sum's first two poppier albums but didn't care for DTLI then I wouldn't recommend this album, but to all those who enjoy Sum's last album, I think you'll enjoy this one also. Chuck is a solid 38 minute long album with heavy guitars and catchy hooks. As far as content goes, the lyrics seem to be a little more serious than on prior albums and seem to be more influenced by current world occurences. But it all comes down to the fact that Sum 41 has done what they do best and put out a quality punk album."
2,harder than old stuff,"This cd was more metal than I expected. Just know that before you buy it. I should have listened to the sample music. If you like the harder stuff, you will probably like this. But if you like the sillier, punk stuff you probably won't."
5,Just your average 18v charger... or is it?,"This thing looks kind of funny, but it gets the job done. It works like any other cordless-tool charger; you put the battery on it, and it charges it.This thing charges the batteries pretty quickly -- and the batteries last long enough that the one in the cradle can easily charge before I've run out of juice on the second battery.It features lights to tell you what it's doing (charging, trickle/maintaining, or charged), it beeps when the battery is ready, and the cord is very long (6 feet or so?) so it's easy to hide the charger under a desk or something or route the cord around things."
2,"50,000 Frenchmen can be wrong","I bought this DVD based on the 87 good reviews. There was a one-star rating, but I thought it was an odd data point. I forgot what my HS history teacher told us: 50,000 Frenchmen can be wrong. Frankly, those who thought it was a 5-bagger must have all their taste in their mouths. I also question their sense of humor: there's not much that's funny about this film.Still, if you are dying to watch a movie, and it's the only thing on TV, go for it, but don't waste your money buying it.PS. Some of the language is a bit hard for a PG-13 rating. I don't advise watching it with kids.PPS. The poster artists' immagination never ceases to amaze me. There is nothing in the movie that even comes close to the picture on the cover."
4,This movie is a hoot.,"Elisabeth plays a cute high school girl waiting for her boyfriend to take her out for the evening. He comes to tell her a cooked-up story that his little sister is sick with something contageous and he has to stay with her. So she ends up babysitting instead. Goofy incident after goofy incident will keep you in tears of laughter. I especially loved the scene in the ""blues"" club where they are forced to create their own little song before they can leave. It keeps you on the edge of your seat as the little girl dangles perilously on the outside of a Chicago skyscraper while their parents party inside. Ya gotta have a copy of it, DVD preferred."
5,Great movie.,Elisabeth Shue is one of my favorite stars. This is Just what I Needed for my collection. Arrived right on time. A must have. A great buy at a great price. 2 Thumbs up.
5,Great movie,I like going backl and watching this movie. That's all I have to say. That's all I have to say.
5,Luv this movie!,I used to watch this movie over and over again when I was young and now my daughter watches it.
4,I Liked It,"It was a great film, the DVD was sent before I expected it @ my home. I would recommend this film, It's hilarious!"
5,GREAT MOVIE,"this is a wonderful movie, we love them older movies from the 80's and 90's. this movie is great for kids"
4,Adventure for sure,I enjoy comedy. Kids can really be entertaining. You never know what can happen when your cancels your date and then take a babysitting job!
5,i love it,Adventures in Babysittingi love it. this is one DVD to take on that desert island and see over and over
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Adventures in Babysitting is the type of movie that 13 year-olds will enjoy, but if you desire something a little bit more than cute adventures after dark you might be better off seeking Martin Scorsese's similarly-themed but far darker and better After Hours."
5,I wish,"By the comedy standards of today - this is genius, this is magic, this is all that film needs to be. Ok Leonard Maltin - it is not Gone With the Wind. It was not meant to be. It is charming, fun, and reminds me of my youth. And I believe it can still appeal to the youth of today, tomorrow and yesterday. What other movie can feature the line - ""Don't ---- with the babysitter"" and stay warm in a 20-something's heart? I love it. Chances are all non-maltins will too."
4,"Excellent movie...not too many great DVD features, though","This is an 80's classic! I have always loved this movie...and I was pretty shocked when I found out that Anthony Rapp...aka Mark in RENT is in it! That was soo cool, especially since I liked his character alot. If you've never seen this movie, you should check it out, but if you're going to buy it, unless it's to add to your DVD collection, I'd stick with VHS."
4,Adventures in Babysitting,Have always liked this movie so decided to add it to my collection. Elizibeth Shue is a favorite actress of mine so that was a plus. The movie is funny and cute all at the same time.
3,I still liked it!,"The rental? Perfect. The movie? One I missed way back when, and it was a real slice of the 80s. Cheesy, predictable, yeah, but bottom line, it reflected niceness. How different. I LOVED realizing Vincent D'Onofrio was the muscular garage owner."
5,Adventures in Babysitting,I loved the movie years ago. It's still good. I wanted to be able to watch it again whenever I wanted.
5,"""Ain't nobody leave here without singing the blues""","What a classic! I felt as giddy as a kid watching this movie many, MANY years later. Such a fun movie with great characters. Shue is wonderful in this as Chris, the BABYSITTER, lot's of laughs and just an all around good time. I jumped at this blu ray when I saw it available for pre-order. Plus, it dropped a couple of bucks with the price match guarantee. If you haven't seen this wonderful film I say you've just got to check it out. They just don't make them like they used to."
5,This movie is amazing!,"This movie is a classic, that I've been watching since I was little kid. I would recommend it for anyone."
4,One Of My Favorite Comedies Ever!,"This a wonderfully delightful comedy about 17 year old Chris Parker. When Chris' boyfriend canceles their date she is persuaded into babysitting a neighboor by her best friend Brenda. The Anderson kids Brad & Sara can't wait till Chris gets there. For Brad he has a hopeless crush on Chris & Sara just loves taunting Brad about his crush. While babysitting Chris gets a call by Brenda saying she's stranded in a downtown bus staition. Chris then decides to go and pick her up but taging along is Brad's annoying best friend Daryl. While on their way to pick her up they get a flat tire in the middle of the freeway, run into gangs, mobs, car theifs, & Sara gets caught outside the top floor windows of a massive skyscraper. You should really pick up this video at the nearest Blockbuster or Hollywood video!Rent it! Sit Back! And Enjoy!"
5,It's Been My Favourite for 5 Years!!,"When I first saw this movie in Los Angeles,California, I thought it was the best comedy i've seen in years.Elisabeth Shue played a wonderful role as Chris Parker.The Story is about a 17 year old girl named Chris Parker who is forced to babysit her neighbours after her date was cancelled.She then gets a call from her best friend Brenda who claims she has run away from home to downtown Chicogo, she must rush to save her and... well the rest is for you to find out!! This film was also availible in VHS form.Enjoy!!!"
5,Best portral of what babysitting actually feels like.,"This movie is by far the best ever made. Touchstone Pictures should re-release it, because I am desperately trying to get my hands on a copy and I have failed. This movie shows all of the heartaches and trama's that babysitters have to go through while babysitting. While, most of the situations are unreal for an average babysitter, the feelings expressed by Shue hit very close to home for many babysitters. It is definitely a hard job at times and this movie shows that as long you keep your head, everything will work out in the end. It also teaches children not to wonder off, or else something bad might happen."
