3,"Not for milshakes, etc.","I made the mistake in buying this to mix milk-protein drinks, it just doesn't have the power to do it. I'm going to buy a Cuisinart or Proctor Silex plug in model that have a lot more power and are about the same price.This is probably great for frothing milk, but they shouldn't have advertised it for making milk shakes or anything that is thick, it just can't handle thicker drinks and really bogs down and even stops."
4,Affordable and usefull,I am satisfied with Aerolatte Milk Frother as it delivered to my expectation. Also it is worth for the price you pay. It does froth milk properly and is also easy to use. Cleaning it is also simple. All in all a worth buy.
1,Short Life,"After stirring 2 cups of coffee daily for a few months, it just quit. Batteries check OK, but no more frothing anything. No better than Ikea junk, but costs several times as much. Took it apart -- commutator failure. Save your money and buy several from Ikea -- throw them out as they die."
2,"Worked well for 4 weeks, badly for 3, and then died","This product worked great for a month and then the last 3 weeks of its life, seemed unable to create a sustainable froth. I think for the price, it should have lasted at least 6 months. I saw one review where they recommended buying the $1 version from IKEA since that reviewer felt they all had a short life. It think I might try that because I did love having the frothy coffee every morning."
4,Great frother!,"This is a great little frother and works very well. My only real concern is the construction of the motor housing unit. The frothing coil and stem are study metal, but the motor unit is plastic. It needs to be treated gently because it doesn't seem terribly sturdy (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.) I just store it in its case so it won't get bumped in the kitchen. The carrying case is also very handy if you want to travel with it.However, the Aerolatte does exactly what it says and makes great froth. Be aware that according to Aerolatte's website, you should either froth very cold milk or milk that is very warm (but has not boiled). They specifically say that room temp milk does not froth well. I heat mine in the microwave for about 30 seconds until it is very warm and then froth it. Then I pour coffee into it to make a delicious cappuccino. Yum!"
3,aerolatte milk frother,"Aerolatte To Go, BlackI used one of these when I visited my daughter and loved it so we ordered it on line so it would be waiting when I returned home. I have been very disappointed in the one I got. The cover for the battery compartment does not fit on tight. It seems like the batteries are too long. As a result, in order for it to work, I have to push down on the battery cover to get a connection with the batteries and then push the button on. It is very awkward. I bought it for my grandchildren (7 and 9) to use and it is too difficult. I did not have this problem with the one I used first so I wonder if mine is defective. Maybe I should have purchased the more expensive one but I was ordering the one I had used. Who knows. It is fun to see hot chocolate stirred so completely so quickly though."
2,Aerolatte To Go milk frother - do not buy,These milk frothers work well for a few weeks but then inexplicably will not function even with fresh batteries. It appears that the connection between the batteries and the on/off switch is lost after a relatively few uses. Buyer beware because these appear to be cheap Chinese-made junk that only last for a short time.
5,Lovely!!,If u like frothy coffee and hate washing ur coffee machine or dont intend to buy one now..this thing definiltey makes up...its almost like a motorised superfast whisk and u must not fill the cup more than half or u can pretty much swirl the coffee out on urself...but once u get the hang of it..u will fall in love with it. I like it.
3,It's overwhelmingly mediocre,"After over a year of faithful service, the frother just broke - the motor burned out. I wont't be buying another Aerolatte. During the time it was working, it worked fine. This frother is not as fast or strong as other models I've used, and I'm disappointed that it burned out so soon."
2,Broke after a few times,"When I first got this, I loved it. I put it in our camping trailer and it was used only infrequently, probably only about 10 times. When I turned it on to use it recently, it worked for about 10 sec. and then the stem fell out of the base unit. Of course it is over 30 days since I bought it and nonreturnable. I am very disappointed. When it worked it was great."
2,only lasted 6 months,"I was happy with this at first but after about 2 months of use (making a single cappuchino every morning for myself), it began to loose its speed even with fresh batteries. At about 6 months, it just stopped working at all."
2,Worked great for 1 week,This worked great until the beater came out of the body and wouldn't stay in after that. Works great while it works. Shoddy production though.
3,Does what it says but could be better by design,"It does froth milk and quite well. It has plenty of power for its assigned task. But it could benefit from a few improvements.The on/off switch is low quality, having a tendency to drift on or off, be sticky, not turn on or off if moved, or get stuck. This switch is not operated for sufficient duration that it should be of the on/off type. It should be a momentary contact pushbutton, which is easily pressed and held.The battery door is flimsy and made from a primitive low precision molding process. For the price, it should really be better than what they've got, especially since higher precision is not that much more cost these days.The base of the unit should be a bit wider so it would more easily stand on the end opposite the impeller."
2,"Works great, but breaks and no support from AeroLatte","I bought one and loved it, then bought more for gifts.Mine just flat out died after 1 year, and amazingly one of the gifts also died the same way.I contacted aerolatte via the email address on their little brochure and they never responded. So works, but cheaply made and not supported by AeroLatte."
3,"Aerolatte To Go, Milk Frother, Black","Aerolatte To Go, Milk Frother, BlackMechanically this frother works well and it froths the milk. I gave it three stars only because the milk must be cold and it stays as cold froth and as a result the coffee is also cooled. We tried to heat the cappuccino in the microwave and the result was a rising airy froth which collapses into a milky cafe au lait. However, if one wants cold froth, it works fine!"
5,Great Product.,it is a nice and good product that Worked as Expected. I would buy it again for a gift anytime.
3,not bad for the price,"wish there was a warming component. Hard to froth warm milk and the cold milk loses it froth quality once you microwave it. That said, its cheap, small and travels well. so I would probably buy again."
1,Broke in less than 3 months of use,"I bought the Aerolatte Mooo Milk Frother and it no longer works after 3 months of pretty regular use. I used my last Aerolatte frother on a daily basis for years. This one simply stopped working. It won't turn on at all. Very, very disappointed."
1,Short Life,I love the idea and enjoyed this a great deal for a few months.I bought two and the same thing with the second one.I will try a different brand next time.
4,Concise and sufficient,"Concise, sufficient and yet vague in certain areas, I'd give this grammar book a 75/100. It does go into quite some depth in regards to grammatical components of the language but the structure of the book itself is rather difficult to navigate through and in some areas can be in which seems, ordered illogically. However I greatly cherish this quite and easy grammar reference and will recommend it to anyone wanting to ameliorate or even learn Norsk :DjulianalleesDen 28 März 2011"
3,Title is misleading,"This book is very much like ""Norwegian: An Essential Grammar"" by se-Berit and Rolf Strandskogen. Eventhough the title indicates that it addresses or teaches Norwegian verbs, it does very little with regard to that -- in fact, it is not much different from the aforementioned book in that sense too. It does do a good job of teaching the grammar, though the title is a misnomer. I was expecting a book *filled* with hundreds of verbs and their conjugations, but there are only about 12 (2x spaced) pages of them. Both the aforementioned and subject books are worth using to learn Norwegian. Mange takk til forfatterene!"
3,Use the pump until you want to cry...,"I used the tiny pump until I wanted to cry because my arms hurt so bad, but I finally got it to 55cm."
5,EVERY MACHETE SHOULD HAVE A HAND GUARD,"I was chopping brush with a machete without a handquard,it slipped out of my hand and disappeared into the river.So then I bought a machete with a lanyard.I was chopping brush with a machete with a lanyard,it slipped out of my hand but didn't fly off.The lanyard swung it into my leg.After I left the emergency room, I bought this machete.I've been a happy camper ever since.They should have named this the ""Safety Machete"".Sold-seperate hunting companionMulti Purpose Axes"
1,Really?,Ordered by mistake. Requested cancellation less than 5 minutes later and the next morning get an email saying it has shipped. Seriously doubt that and wonder why they didn't cancel when I asked? Won't use them again nor will I suggest them to anyone either and do not respond to emails!
2,Not what I was looking for...,"Although very soft to the touch and warm, I do not like this blanket for yoga. It is full of lint, even after washing. It is very bulky, so it does not fold tightly or stay put. It is way too soft to give firm support for poses such as shoulder stand or to roll up and use as a bolster. If you are looking for a blanket to use as a throw, this blanket is fine, but I would not recommend it for yoga."
5,Great blanket for yoga,"When I looked at the reviews to buy this blanket everyone said it smelled really bad, so I was bracing myself when I received it. But it really didn't smell bad. It had a similar smell to any other mexican blanket I've ever purchased, a little agricultural. And the smell washed out fine after one wash. The blanket is nice and heavy, but still fluffy and soft. I can roll it up and it works as a good supportive bolster, or I can rest it over me in savasana to keep warm. And it is a really pretty plaid...I was worried at first about not being able to chose my color, but I wasn't disappointed."
1,Lint,"This product looks nice, the weight is fine but it lints so bad you can't use it aroundchildren,pets. I fact I'm sorry I even bought this product.What the say about thereproduct is a joke."
2,Stinky!!!,"This blanket smelled really, really bad (a strong chemical smell). It is made of 100% acrylic fiber. About 3 days after opening the package the odor had not diminished one bit so I washed it 3 times with detergent and borax which got most of the stink out. Also, this is NOT a heavy duty blanket - more like medium duty. On the plus-side it is soft and warm."
4,Great Blanket!,"The blanket was not at heavy as I would have liked, but it is softer than I thought it would be. The smell was not terrible and it mostly washed out in one wash. Also, I was a little concerned about not being able to choose my color, but I was pleasantly surprised."
5,VisitorQ's Australia,"Rather propaganda than musical or tourist guide, this movie portraits Australia through Japanese youngsters eyes-funny, sexy and careless, catching a wave for surfing and laying chicks the most problems are.It is a really relaxing and surprisingly easy-to-consume Australian production."
4,Last Resort by Milton Crabapple,I bought this for a present for my father. He LOVES this comedian. This is mostly songs and it's okay. We enjoy his comedy line better than the songs or a mix. I would have prefered the other but this was okay.
2,Not impressed,"While there are Redken products I've liked, this one has left much to be desired. Glass, seeming to be the hot product about two years ago, has never done more than seemingly coat my hair with a mild residue of greasiness. It never seemed to penetrate into the cuticles of the hair nor to create any kind of style that left me feeling satisfied. On top of this, I've had to use large amounts and even then, I don't find that the frizz is lessened all that much. Perhaps my hair is a bit too unruly for Glass...I've found that Matrix Biolage's Curl Defining Creme has a much better hold on frizz than Glass does."
2,Redken Smoothing serum,"It's just OK. I was looking for something to replace Artec smoothing serum by L'Oreal. This works OK when you first put it on, but it is too watery based. Doesn't have enough holding power. The next morning it's like you didn't use anything at all.Still looking for replacement."
2,"90% good, then poor finish","I picked up this book with the hope it would be on a par with Lawrence Block's excellent ""Bernie the Burglar"" series. But it isn't. It starts out reading like a comical cozy mystery, albeit with too much unnatural profanity. Stanley Hastings is hired by a rich lady to find out who is giving her threatening phone calls, and as he starts investigating, people drop dead. And then more interesting things happen, like a fish message that sounds like something the mafia might do. But just as it is getting good, the book takes a terrible left turn about 30 pages from the end, leaving me feeling terribly cheated. And the very final scene made no sense whatsoever... how in the world did the criminal get nabbed? I am sorry, this just didn't work for me at all."
5,Ah the wonders of Disney,"Mary Poppins ... blah! :) This is a marvelous movie with a marvelous soundtrack! Helen Reddy fans, enjoy her! Disney fance, enjoy this! A fun soundtrack with marvelous memories from the movie. ""Candle on the Water,"" a great ballad! I love this movie, however was a bit nervous and unsure about the soundtrack. However, this soundtrack does a great job capturing the magic and wonderful and sublime innocence of the film."
1,WHAT A RIP OFF! Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine : Apitherapy IS NOTHING AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE THIS,"Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine : Apitherapy is a RIP OFF! This is nothing, I do not need the definition of Apitherapy, it seemed this would be a guide to Apitherapy, instead it is ONE Page of NOTHING! Amazon is a rip off too, if you buy an ebook, you get NO REFUND! NO REFUND ON EBOOKS?!?~?~?~@#$%^ AMAZON!"
4,Celtic Inspirations,"Celtic Inspirations: Essential Meditations and TextsWilde uses fantastic organization and imagery in 152 pages to deal with five different subjects: The Treasure Chest, Druids, The Body, Sky and Landscape, Symbols, and Heroes of the spirit. Who are the Celts? From where do they originate? What were their stenghts? What were the symbols and items that they carried with them through out their culture? What did the cup truly mean? What was a cauldron? What meaning was a horse?The photographs of forests, dying wool, and sidhe are so fantastic. The drawings are stunnings and match the the tenner of the day. I would buy it alone for that, the use of herbs and a quick reference. Its a short and sweet kind of book."
5,Relaxing to read,"I agree this is a nice little gem to read when I like to relax and curl up with a book that gives me that ""take me away to the Otherworld"" feeling. Very meditative to read, allows your imagination to run free when we need to. It is put together well and the pictures and photos are equally enchanting. Thanks for a wonderful mental get away and some great meditation material."
4,This is good country rock!,If you like classic country rock you will not be disappointed by this CD. It is a who's who of early 70s country rock.
3,One serious electrical defect,"For the most part, everything that this product was supposed to be, it was. I have bought and installed a whole house fan before, so I knew what to expect. However, the ""on/off"" switch (sort of a 3-way switch) sparks when being turned off. I know that is not how it is supposed to be. The rest of the fan seems to work okay.When I contacted the seller about this problem, to either get another 3-way switch or to give me some sort of remuneration for the switch (I am pretty certain that I can figure out how to bypass this switch so that it is either on or off), he told me to contact Amazon directly, which made no sense to me, so I didn't."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"Arrived with shutters broke in 7 pieces, unable to get replacement so far, even though was assured by Amazon if I sent shutters back I could.Very flimsey louvers & skirting is just cheap cardboard. Doesn't include allen wrench for blades even though 99 percent of purchases include one, if needed.Box is built poorly.John"
5,A great guide that is easy to follow,I bring this with me hiking and try to visit at least one of them everytime. A great guide that is an invaluable tool for any hiker in the Adirondacks area.
2,Limited Applicability,"I was first exposed to PCMM while serving on a Human Capital planning committee for a small federal agency. While the ideas and strategies are intriguing, they bump up against then flounder in organizations where senior leadership is weak, subject to change (election cycles, in our case), or offer PCMM as a ""flavor of the month."" Absent rock solid commitment and active long term engagement by senior leadership, this should not be undertaken. To achieve the noble and highly desirable outcomes of PCMM takes fearlessness and commitment; things sorely lacking in most organizations. In the end, trying and failing miserably did us more harm than good. This is not a half-hearted endeavor nor one most organization can realistically attain. Small, lean, youthful organizations may be the better suited to this approach."
3,Not To Be Confused with......,"As GC put it in his song ""Why Did You Dog Me Out,"" This is NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH the Parliament Clinton fans know and love. Pretty oddball stuff, for the most part. A curious mix of the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Motown and a lot of it goes down like mustard and ice cream.In the midst of the largely bizzare tunes are a few nice surprises. ""Dont Be Sore At Me"" is quite appealing with Clinton doing a Beatle-esque accent (Clinton once said the Fab 4 were his all time favorite group and it shows here). ""I Wanna Testify"" is not bad, sort of predates the pscychadelic soul that Sly Stone would do a short while later. ""I Can Feel The Ice"" has an offbeat charm as it owes more to London than Motown. In short, good for historical and curiousity value mostly. You may find ""Don't Be Sore At Me"" to be one of those songs that you can't help singing to youself."
1,Why all the hype?,"I am sorely disappointed in this book. I LOVE to read all types and genres of books, and was extremely excited to receive this due to all the glowing reviews. I took it with me on a mini-vacation expecting a quick, witty, relevant read. After 5 chapters, I finally put it down because I simply couldn't take any more. To me it seems like the author is simply trying to make excuses as to why she doesn't do this or that (i.e. clean her house or kids, cook, etc.) Do yourself a favor... borrow this from the library before spending your hard earned money. If you like it enough, then buy it. This is one book that will not make it into my collection!"
2,a long magazine article,"Although I did enjoy the book and found it entaining and ringing true with its anecdotes, I felt that it could have been summed up and shortened into a magazine article-- it lacked substance for a 200 page plus book."
2,Simplistic and obvious,"This book is just one long rant about what are now completely obvious pressures that society places on a female in a family. There is nothing in there that is not known to every working woman and the author simply goes on and on about them and how she privately rebels and doesn't wash laundry every day or how she and her husband share chores. There is nothing new or interesting here, skip it."
4,You go girl!,"Following on fromConfessions of a Slacker Mom, one of the most sensible parenting books I've read, this is the book about consciously NOT doing it all.Coming from an obviously intelligent and relatively self-confident working woman, mom and wife, this is an interesting and well backed-up take on why our expectations regarding cleanliness, being the perfect hostess / wife / mother, etc. have escalated out of all proportion, and gives good reasons for taking the pressure to live up to these unrealistic and over-rated standards off ourselves.Read it, and see if the attitude fits. If it does, you'll have done yourself a huge favor. If not, you can always pass it on to someone who will appreciate it."
3,"I liked ""Confessions of a Slacker MOM"" better","Maybe I likedConfessions of a Slacker Mombetter because because I read this one second or because I couldn't connect as well with the author's perspective. Either way, you should read ""Confessions of a Slacker Mom"", it is funny, insightful and very relatable."
1,Caps lock sticks on this machine,"Sorry, the dv8000 is a poor machine... it has shaken my confidence in HP forever,,,Like many others I have the CAPSLOCK problem ... for no reason it ""sticks"" in the on position and freezes up ...requiring a reboot every time, sometimes three times a day... HP CS reads their script (reload the operating system etc.) but can't help... the hardware is just sub par...After a full year of patience I've just gotten used to rebooting several times a day... each time reinforcing my opinion of this one-great company. It will be my last HP product."
5,my favorite of all their albums,I own several CS albums and have seen them in concert and this is by far my favorite. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys political satire.
3,Not enough useful practical information,"The author discusses positive training adnosium and yet she glosses over important points and techniques. Potty training is covered in a page and a half, which seems a bit scant to me in a book about dog training. This is not so much a book on how to train your dog but book on the philosophy of positive dog training."
3,3E Incomplete,"I received the 3rd edition of this book, not the 2nd, which is what is represented to be. The ""3rd"" has less/different information. Buyer beware."
1,"Is the idiot the reader or the writer, I wonder???","The main reason I purchased this book is to learn things like stopping aggression toward certain guests. My newly adopted dog is fine toward many folks, but not so great when my young neighbor comes knocking on my door. Turn to page 49.What do you learn? You learn some of the reasons why your dog might be aggressive, but in this entire book there is not one single method taught to actually reverse agression. I've learned a lot more from five minutes of watching Caesar Milan or from It's me or the dog than from this entire book. A total waste of my hard earned money."
2,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Pamela Dennison's World,"I found this book to be a disappointment on many levels. First, the author tries to be cute and conversational but comes off as simply annoying. This problem could be overlooked, however, if most of her advice wasn't based on questionable ""scientific evidence"" (no relevant documentation of this evidence is provided). To make matters worse, many of Ms. Dennison's observations about ""normal"" canine behavior are...well, wrong. Even a casual observer of canine behavior can't help but find fault with a number of her assertions. Save your money...buy another training book. I wish I had."
5,Nutrition Advice at it's best.,"I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking health is this day and age of processed foods. Elly G. White was way ahead of her times in knowing that diseases could be prevented through sound diet and healthy Lifestyles. Myself, I eat only fruits and vegetables ... nothing else. I use this book in giving advice to others on the path to better health. Ellyn G. White wrote many books and letters in her wonderful and fullfilled Life. Robert Cohen found a way to glean through her wisdom and bring the best together in this book. This book will hold a place of honor in my library."
1,another insane rant from the desk of Robert Cohen,"Obviously the copyright has expired on this book, so Cohen felt free to rip off Ellen White. Don't bother with this book, it's a total piece of garbage."
2,Not the one,"I have owned this machine for about 8 months now and its time for a new machine. I now make pasta about twice a week and I have been having unacceptable problems with it for about two months now.This machine is not made very well. The adjustable rollers that thin out your sheets wobble, creating problems with dough thickness which is vital to the pasta making process. This problem got worst over time. Also since day one, the knob that controls the thickness settings is difficult to use and not very accurate.I will not buy this machine again and I can not recommend it to anyone."
3,"Works fine, but need a table with wide edge to attach it","I used this Pasta Machine for a couple of times. Need very dry mixture of flour to make nice noodles. My table has a narrow edge, very hard to attach the machine."
1,Don't buy,It is a very low quality product. I have used it for only 3 or 4 times. The roller stopped working. It must be the problem of the gear inside. My neighbour had the same machine and it broke down after the first use. It is not worth the money. Please be careful.
1,not worthy at all,"This machine, even at the great discount price, is still not worth of the money. After only 5 uses, it is already broken! The material was of such poor quality, it is really a piece of junk!"
3,Pasta at a low price,"I am fairly happy with the past machine. It works great for rolling out long strips of dough and pretty well for cutting the pasta. My only complaint so far is the plastic clamp handle that has already stripped out and will no longer let you clamp the pasta machine to the counter. I will have to find a replacement or use a C clamp to hold the machine in place. Otherwise, works well enough to make pasta."
1,worst experience,"I ordered this machine and get a defective one at the first time. Its cutting rolls didn't work well. I asked for a replacement and got a refurbished one. The second one was also bad. Its cutting part and the body part didn't fit. When I turned the handle, the cutting part went up and down with the handle, and sometimes even slipped down suddenly! I called the services and hoped them to send me a good one, but I was told to ask for refund. Now I have no choice but to return it. This is my worst experience shopping here! If you don't have enough patience, stay away from it, it wastes a lot of time!"
2,poor quality,The price of this machine is very attractive. But you get what you paid for. The quality is poor. I was only able to make about 4 pounds of noodle before it literally fell in parts. After the second time I use it a nut dropped off the bottom. Because of the poor design I have to open it to put the nut back. Then after the 3rd use the cutting accessory got stuck. I opened it again and saw the gears worn out. Now it's completely useless.I do not recommand this machine.
3,Solid machine but I had some problems...,"Grabbed this for 15$ and figured I'd give homemade pasta a shot. maybe not the best idea for me. The machine itself is very solid and is well built. BUT I had issues with the handle staying on as well as mounting. The sheet or two I did get out were fine though. I recently got a KitchenAid so I'll probably go that route for pasta, even easier than this would be if I could figure out how to use it. I had no problems with grease on the machine first use and it did clean up easily with just a bit of work."
4,pasta machine,I was pleased with the machine. I purchased it for a gift. It was very easy to use. It's used all the time. Sure is enjoyed.
1,No good even for 1 star!,"Not recommend it at all!!! Wondered why it got a good feedback - maybe the quality of this product is not stable and most buyers had a bad luck.I just got one - it did not do the work at all, although it copied the outlook of those good machines."
1,TOO hard to clean,"I have owned this machine over 2 years, and am giving it to Goodwill. It is too hard to clean. Dough pieces work their way into the works, and cannot be removed without removing 9 screws. It works fine, but does not shield against dough collection. If you only wnt to use it one or two times a year, it is great. If you want a real pasta maker, it is useless."
1,A piece of junk,Is it made of stainless steel? It rusts after one time use. I tried to make some whole-wheat pie but I quited. It was even not as easy as I made using my own hands.I would give negative five stars if I could. This is the first review I gave at amazon.
2,Buy premade pasta!,"This machine looks cool, till you use it. It is a pain to clean because dough gets in the cracks. Also you need a minimum of three hands to operate it and make the pasta."
1,spend the money on a good one!,It's was damaged upon arrival and chintzy what more can I say just buckle down and spring for the expensive one from Italy.
2,I would rather spend more to get a better one,"I bought this with a deal (15 bucks), but it turns out so difficult to use. I saw other people have had similar problems with mine: the dough can't go through; steel oddments from the machine stuck to the dough; noodles stuck together unless you make your dough really dry--which is very hard for me. Now I just set it on my kitchen counter and never use it any more.I would have paid more to get a better one."
1,prime pacific stainless steel pasta machine,"very poor quality. i used one similar to that for 30 years and have never had the trouble that i had. used it twice, but i hadn't used it until the return date was up. i would never buy one again."
2,This pasta machine is not practical,I was looking forward to an easy way to make pasta at home and purchased this item with that expectation. It does not make it easy to make pasta and is difficult to keep clean.
2,Not worth the price,"This was my first pasta machine and I would return it if I could figure out how. The dial on the side is on backwards so the dial number is reversed from settings listed on a recipe. The cutter doesn't cut the pasta clear through, so I have to pull all of them apart. I have tried lubricating the cutters and using more flour to no avail"
3,Pasta Machine,"I bought this for my wife, who is a prolific recipe chaser. The product is solidly designed but should come with a parts book and drawings. Assembly was poor and incomplete. I had to realign the the end panels and tighten the screws holding base to the legs. If I had been mechanically challenged it would have had to been returned."
1,Don't buy cheap machine like this,I returned this machine because the roller stopped working (stuck or slip) on high (thick) settings (5-7) after several uses. The rollers are also not parrellel so that it produces uneven thickness and feeding speed for the sheet with low (thin) settings (1-3).
1,Some Assembly Required,"I was happy when I received my pasta maker, hoping I could make pasta for my kids. But when I opened it, it was in pieces. The screws came out and the rollers were not working at all when I turned the crank. I had to open it up and piece it back together. Lucky for me there was no instructions to assemble it so I had to tinker with it for an hour. When I got it pieced together and then made some dough, I ran it through the roller and guess what, the pasta did not go straight down the cutter. It just wraps around the roller. I've read some others reviews to add more flour, so I tried it and it still didn't work. I kinda wish I spent an extra 20 bucks for the name brand pasta maker. I probably is worth the price and a lot less trouble. So I recommend a skip this and buy the other guys stuff."
2,you got what you paid for,"the product looks great, and comes with many options but.. start using it.... I wonder if it is my dough or what, but the dough comes out in extremely uneven thicknesses, and the cut dough ""strands"" stick to each other... does it mean i need to make my dough thicker or what?"
2,Decent for the $,"This is the first pasta machine I have ever owned, so it is a good starter for the money. I bent the mounting brackets for the pasta mill with average pressure. It is hard to affix to a counter top. The wingnut rubs against the face of the cabinet. The c clamp also broke. I had to fix that as well."
4,spaghetti maker,This pasta maker was cheaper than any others I had found on the internet. When it came I was pleasantly surprised. It was good quality and arrived very quickly.
1,Please don't use this book to teach an EC class!!!,This book did nothing to enhance my knowledge of E-Commerce. The terms used in this book are not terms that are commonly used. The authors should not be writing textbooks or instructional guides. The illustrations and diagrams did nothing to help the reader understand the material. The diagrams were literally a joke used just to fill up space. I quickly got tired of being given a short definition and told it will be discussed later. The book doesn't flow and leaves the reader frustrated. The authors use of E-Commerce terminology was too often bogged down in clichéd rhetoric. Don't use this book to gain knowledge about E-Commerce you'll find yourself falling asleep and rereading sentences way too often.
2,3 out of 11 is pretty bad,"Out of the 11 stories I liked 3. My adivce would be to read the stories by Longyear (Best), Yolen (great), Wrede (good) and then forget about the rest. The funny thing is that the stories I hated the most were by the biggest name authors Brust and Wolfe. Most of the stories were like reading a single chapter out of a 'pulpish' fantasy novel. The characters attempted to be clever, there was a (simple) problem and it was solved (unoriginally). This is kind of what I remember the first Theive's World being like (about 15 years ago). If you like that kind of thing go for it, but I won't be hunting down the rest of this series."
3,Worth a look!,"For historical significance this movie deserves more than 3 stars, but one should rate movies based on how much one actually liked the movie, thus my 3-star rating. (This still means I liked and recommend the movie!) I watched this after seeing Frank Beyer's ""Jakob the Liar,"" and I think ""Naked Among Wolves"" is the better film. One of my nit-picks with these films is that the harshness and brutality of life in the ghetto or concentration camp is not fully revealed. The films are products of their times, I suppose. And one cannot make actors look like skeletons. The most brutal portrayl of the holocaust I have seen (in a non-documentary) is in the TV mini-series ""War and Remembrance."" Neither of Beyer's films comes close. Again, I'm sure that there was so much an East German film director in the 1960's and 70's could do. That criticism out of the way, I think that ""Naked Among Wolves"" is a fine film with interesting characters and performances."
4,Little Friends to Light up your Nursery,"This lamp is adorable and makes your Froggy Tales set complete. The little frog, duck and dragonfly matches perfectly and are made of wood. The only thing I would caution on is the lampshade. It is delicate and if bent or creased, it leaves a permanent mark which is very noticable when the light is on."
5,Fascinating package on a fascinating myth,"The myth of the ten lost tribes has found its way into many cultures around the world. This fascinating package covers the myth from different angles. The book has a great introduction on the topic, and includes original essays by a cast of strange and wonderful characters who describe their encounters with the ten tribes.The CD-ROM is a beautiful enthnographic/historical exposition based on an exhibition of the same name at Beth Hatefutsoth - the Jewish Diaspora museum in Tel Aviv.As a bonus there is are some music tracks on the CD which give full renditions of some of the haunting music found on the CD-ROMA great bar/bat mitva gift or just a fun gift for historical buffs or anyone who likes the exotic.Highly recommended."
4,Easy on and off,Works great and make ps it much easier to carry mat. Strap is just the right length for thick or thin mat.
5,Yoga strap,It's lightweight and easy to use. The multi-colored pattern would compliment just about any color mat. I would buy it again.
3,I prefer velcro,"I didn't like the strap. It was a little clunky with the buckles. I prefer velcro I guess. But it was as described, so it's just a matter of preference."
3,Workmanlike,Does what it should. I ride my bike to yoga... would have liked the shoulder strap to be adjustable.
5,"Great strap for carrying, and for stretch exercises","When I first saw my girlfriend with her yoga mat so carefully strapped over her shoulder, I had to have mine. The yoga bags never worked for me. It takes a long time to put my mat in one, at least the one I had, and then after class I never want to put it back in after all the perspiration. The strap is great and it even fits my larger and bulky Manduka mat, it is reliable, and made of great material. I also have used it to do neck stretches and other stretching exercises so it already has been serving on multiple layers. Love it!"
5,"Sturdy, Functional","This item does its job. I'm not the biggest fan of the design, but it's cheap and feels comfortable when transporting my yoga mat.Recommended."
4,Adequate Fitting Strap for a Mat,"I ordered this strap in conjunction with YogaAccessories' 1/4"" Extra Thick Deluxe Yoga Mat. The strap holds that mat just fine and it is the right length.Sometimes it's hard to get the shoulder strap around because it is quite short and not adjustable."
1,Yoga Mat Strap,I bought the yoga mat strap and found that the velcro isn't long enough to accomodate a tightly rolled mat. It slips right off the end and the strap is too long to carry so I end up holding the mat anyway. I stopped using it!
5,Aye aye,"Works really well, looks really cool. What else you need to know? (I'm a guy too, and I like it a lot!)"
4,Great strap,"The strap is sturdy and solid, it arrived very quickly and holds my yoga mat very well!! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a travel strap."
1,rehash,total rehash of other ideas from thinkers some good some no so good not worth buying I would definitely not recommend this book
4,great guidebook,"I bought 2 guidebooks for CA wine country. This one was great for most everything, but the other was more encompassing with regards to winery/vineyard recommendations. This was best for background information, transportation, activities, places to stay and eat, etc. Nice maps of Napa and Sonoma, as well as driving areas between popular regions. Overall very good, and you could easily get around only using this book."
4,"Tips are high quality, but there aren't many of them!","This book is a great size, and offers a well rounded summary of what Napa and Sonoma have to offer visitors. However, when it comes to winery and restaurant recommendations, this books only suggests a few (2-6) from each area of the valleys, and of those, only a handful have received Frommer's ratings. There's so many more vineyards and restaurants in these regions, so more ""recommended"" locations would have been helpful. Still, considering its travel-friendly size, this is a nice book to have on hand when planning a trip to this part of the country."
2,"Broad, Generic, Timid","This, like the other Frommer's Guides I have seen, seems to be timid, generic and void of fun, gritty, insider information. It gave some useful information to read on the plane about various wineries, but I left it in my hotel the days I headed out to Sonoma, and this I did on purpose. Do your research and buy a better guide."
3,"Good technology, exasperating narration","I bought this audio bible because I wanted the King James Version, and the convenience of just three 3 CDs (as opposed to many CDs or cassettes in other versions) was appealing.Unfortunately, the narrator reads very quickly and without feeling. When I got to his version of Ecclesiastes I was astonished at how he raced through those moving and elegiac passages with an almost upbeat radio disc jockey tone. What's more, if you are not already familiar with a passage he is reading, it is difficult to hang on to the meaning as he rushes on.It's possible that it's worth dealing with the inconvenience of a multiple CD non-mp3 version. The Bible requires a narrator who sounds like he cares."
4,95% good,i said 95 % because my skin is really dry and dont last me all day ... so i have to mix it with other moisturizer but other than that i love it my sking look so much better ... im extremely alergic and i get rash right away but with this product my skin got so much healthyer .....
1,Dead babies on your face,This cream contains remains of aborted fetous. It is so good because contains somebody else skin in it. Google it if you do not believ me.
4,Love It,"I first purchased this product through my dermatologist. This cream is wonderful for the skin, especially if you have sensitive skin. What is even better, is that I purchsed this through Amazon and got it at lower price than if I purchased through my dermatologist."
4,Have used this for many years,I trust the company to make a good product. First bought this through a doctor's clinic. Was glad to find I could get it online for about 50% less.
4,Unique,"Typically the WSQ begin each track with a recognizable statement of a Duke Ellingon theme, and they're really good. The harmonies are mostly traditional but maybe a little edgy. By the middle of the track they are off on their own trip. You will not hear such sounds elsewhere. Repeated squeaks, pained ululations, unidentifiable low frequency boops, triple-time runs that sound like a waltzing mouse looks. It isn't ""easy listening"" music. I don't know how often you would want to play this CD. I would suggest longish intervals. And a drink or a Xanax before listening wouldn't hurt either because the normal human must consider his nerves. But it's unique. Both bluesy and insane. It will leave you with a fresh impression of the things that can be done with four simple saxophones."
2,Defective,I chose this rating because the stapler had a piece broken off of it and it would not work. I had to return it. Very dissapponted.
3,Good solid tool.,"I work with handmade rugs. I could not use this model for tags because the staples are too big and thick.I should buy a lower model (p22), but we use it to make boxes in other department very good for that.The big issue is you can not find the staples in regular stores should order on line or search for it."
2,Frustrated user!,"I have two P35 staplers - one is about 7 years old, the other is 5 years old. The problem lately is that none of the 356 model staples are working in either stapler for an extended period of time. The first 50 or so staples work, but then they begin to fail in puncturing the cardboard. I've tried spraying the moving parts of the P35's with silicone, and sprayed the sleeve of staples after inserting them in the P35- to no avail. It's very frustrating to have a deadline for making cardboard boxes and not have either P35 working with the 356 staples. I've tried 3 different boxes of 356 staples with the same consistent failure for each box. The staples won't fold over and close even if they puncture with great difficulty. Bummer!!"
1,PROTECTIVE PAD,"This pad is not worth much= not even the $4+ that used to be its price - if it is to protect from wetness. Very thin and without body. Absorbbs very little. It can protect and area from wear and tear, I suppose....but not much nore."
4,Durable and light weight,"We use this as a seat protector when we travel with our dog, for changing visiting babies, and generally for ""protection"" whenever anything too messy seems likely.It works great, is a good size to throw in the washing machine, and always seems to come out clean.Only quibble: the back is rather slick, so it can slip around more than you might like."
3,Does its job.,"This product saves a bunch of time when installing hardware. However, I believe it is cheaper at Home Depot or Lowes. Although its only different by a dollar (or thereabouts)...Don't drill through the plastic, but mark it first with a pencil before you drill the pilot holes."
1,"Only 4"" or smaller","As the other reviewer wrote, if you have drawer pulls larger than 4 inches between the screws, this will not work for you. Mine are 5 inches. Bummer."
2,Bad description/measurements,"The packaging of this product isn't even 11.5 x 6 x 10 inches, let alone the actual template used to align the mounting holes. Our drawer handles are about 6"" long, and the maximum width on the template is 5"" (which is odd for a product that is supposed to be almost 12"" in length). We won't bother returning it since it was under $7, but I wouldn't recommend the product unless you're only using single knobs on smaller drawers."
2,not good,"We used this griddle successfully with cooking spray to cook pancakes, the chicken breasts and fish we tried (on the flat side) stuck horribly and were really tough to clean up. Not sure if we used cooking spray for them. Cooking bacon on the griddle side was a nightmare - it glued itself to the surface. I do NOT recommend this griddle, unless you like to well oil all cooking surfaces, even for your bacon, and don't mind lengthy scrubbing!"
3,Very Hard To Clean,"I love cooking with this thing, but is extremely hard to clean. I bought it in October 2006 and the non-stick layer is starting to peel off already and I have not used any metal utensils on it."
5,Golly!,"Joe and his parents move to Fear Street run Grandpa Howie's hotel. One day his father made a coffin trick for the visitors. One day he hears creepy noises, footsteps and it sounds like Count dracula. Order this book now please! I Beg you."
5,my review of paradise kiss,"I have stopped liking manga and anime a few years ago. I used to be very interested in them but after a while certain aspects of them began to bother me. However, I must admit that I like Paradise Kiss a lot. Although it is a manga, the art is different from most manga and the writing style and descriptive quality are also different. In particular I like the clear intention of the author to make her manga similar to the movie Velvet Goldmine, which is an amazing movie--George is clearly based on Brian Slade and Seiji is based on Kurt Wild (by the way, I highly recommend this movie to those who liked Paradise Kiss--it's about glam rock).Good storyline too--I like that the main character is thinking critcally, is reevaluating her decisions, and recognizing her faults--I also find this not typical of most manga I have read. Oh, and I love the bi guys :)"
4,Surprised,"I've never really been into reading Manga but after watching the anime and enjoying, I spotted the manga and bought it on a whim. I was really surprised, it has an interesting story line that differs enough from a large number of the manga's out there which makes good enough to stand out. While it does have the typical romance in it, that isn't the focus, it's about a girl feeling lost, bored and without a focus in her life. She's been doing what her parents want for her entire life and meeting a new group of people exposes her to a side of life that she has never thaught about and captivates her. I'm not going to say anymore so that I don't give anything away."
5,ParaKiss Paradise,"I have read all three Paradise Kiss books published at the moment, and flittering about as I wait for the fourth to become available. This is one of the best manga I have ever read, and I happened to have read over 50 different series. The book is about Yukari aka Caroline, an eighteen year old high school student who is slowly discovering that she is living a life that is choking her spirit. In a chance meeting with Arashi, the hotheaded punk; and Isabella, the drag queen who is throughly sweet, she becomes entangled with the whole ParaKiss group, including the irresistable Miwako and the unforgettable George; and discovers that there is more to life than just getting into college and becoming successful. This book is a self journey of Yukari and her figuring out what she wants out of life, combined with Paradise Kiss, the designer lable hoping to make it big through its four members and newfound model: Hayasaki Yukari"
3,Best Investment book,I have read many investment books but this gets my vote for the best of all of them. It is very easy to read as it is so well written and Mr. Vick makes many points that are so indisputable that I plan to re-read and re-read this book many times over in order to see through the sales pitch that Wall Street often sells us.
5,Well written by a master journalist.,"I have heard Mr Lindorff talk about the good and bad sides of American justice on CNN and network television and was astonished at his reporting that the US Government Terrorism hotline is answered by staff at the television show ""America's Most Wanted"". In ""Killing Time"" Mr Lindorff has sensitively balanced the needs for fairness and closure in the tragedy of the murder of a young policeman followed by the assignment to death row of one of Philadelphia's most promising broadcast journalists.Susanna J Dodgson, PhD, Publisher, Emerald Pademelon Press."
5,"At last, the real story","The case of Mumia Abu Jamal has been a sore point in the history of Philadelphia for some time. It is a case that has polarized people in Philadelphia and around the world. This is the first account to painstakingly analyze the case with an eye on obtaining justice. It is very much NOT a political screed for either side.With scholarly thoroughness, Lindorff has given the case a new life. It's all there written in a lively style. In the end, no matter whether Jamal is guilty or innocent, the book uses the facts to make it clear he did not get a fair trial in the highly volatile climate in Philadelphia at the time of the murder.The book is essential reading for anyone interested in race, issues of justice and the death penalty in America. It is also the tale of one of our most troubling modern murder mysteries."
3,OK,"I bought this at Marshall's for the fraction of the price listed here. It's okay. It did help some of the puffiness I experience with allergies, but the dark cirles are still there. It also has a funky odor."
1,who are you kidding???,"I cannot believe this book is being marketed to 9-12 year olds! There are like 5 words on each page! I showed it to my 11 year old son when I bought it and he laughed...my six year old wanted the book AND the CD. If you want it for a little kid, fine, but don't think it's for a 9-12 year old."
3,Another Maths Book,"Again a typical maths book. I am still learning how to apply numerical methods to real life problems, so I have not found this book to be very useful. I am sure that when I have a good grasp of how to apply numerical methods and solve real problems, then this book will be the one to refer back too."
1,Great Shows ---- Too Expensive for What You Get,"The Abbott and Costello TV Show was a gem ... even though Bud and Lou were near the end of their careers ... they were still top notch. The ONLY gripe I have with these volumes is that someone is really GOUGING .... the typical TV show is being sold on DVD these days at about $25-$45 a season (20 half-hour episodes, approximately). This is 4 episodes for about $17-20 or so .... way over priced. It should have been all episodes of SEASON ONE for about $35 ... a pity. I would have owned ALL of the Bud and Lou TV shows, GLADLY, if someone somewhere did not seek excessive profits. DON'T buy this Volume or any of the rest in the series ... you will only be encouraging these idiots. Wait until the prices come down to REASON !"
2,The Norton Book of PC Science Fiction,"While there are some excellent stories in this volume, the editors excluded authors and stories because they didn't meet their politically correct feminist viewpoints. Accordingly, this book doesn't represent a true cross section of the SF field which greatly diminishes it's usefulness as a reference."
4,A Pretty Good Concert,"Aside from the fact that it was ""cramped quarters"" for the stage & not much room to spread out, it was a pretty good concert by the Dolls. I thought they really sounded like a ""New-York"" band (I love NYC!)& the Blu-Ray format made for great viewing."
1,Total Disappointment,"This is a complete waste of time, and a way to get easy cash from the producers and distributors of this game.I bet with everyone that the guy who gave it 5 stars probably is one of CA (Creative Assembly) cursed staff. Just look at the way he quoted magazines ""Oh wonderful graphics"" ""Best game ever"" bla bla bla and all the crap you can wonder.Of course, the magazines players and testers come to fall in the eyecandy category, and when they see good graphics they categorize it like the game of the century. Total Disappointment.I hope you learned from this reviem."
2,Forget this Guide !!!,Why bother buying this guide !when playing the gameyou have two Roman advice guides to help you.
5,An excellent second novel,"I have just finished reading this novel and could not put it down, it is superb! I feel that I must disagree with the above review by Kelly Flynn - if anything this book is more engaging tham ""The Merchants House"""
4,Love the smell!,I love cranberries so I adore the smell of this lip balm. Since it is from the body shop it contains both fair trade ingrediants and organic beeswax. You have to love good quality products that are also good for the earth. My only problem with this lip balm is the color it is a sheer red with gold glitter flecks. It is a little to tween girl for me. So I just use it at home or before I go to bed.
5,Beyond!,I have bought 2 of these 5 light kits. They are excellent! I use the initial set as a tester to decide as to whether or not I would like the bendable track lighting. Well...I loved it. I went ahead and installed the hard wired track lighting and now wonder why I waisted my time!
4,Rich experiences through the short story,"This collection of stories is generally very strong, and I was exposed to new writers. My favorite stories were Mr. Sender by Moira Crone, My Heart Is a Snake Farm by Allan Gurganus, and Good Witch Bad Witch b y Gregory Sanders. Each of these stories was complex and yet very warm and engaging. As Jill McCorkele hits the nail on the head when she describes southern writing as working your way through a maze of experiences to understand and appreciate the richness and texture of life. With few exceptions, these stories lead you through an intriguing and challenging maze."
4,What fun,"I really enjoyed this whimsical tale of a goose, a gem, Sherlock Holmes and Watson.Sherlock, being Sherlock makes the apparent seem like phantasmas and the unlikely like a given fact.WaAr"
4,Great Lipstick,"I bought my first Maybelline Wet Shine Ice Princess Lipstick ages ago and I used it until it was done. I wanted to buy a new one, but could not find it in any store - so I looked on the internet and found it here.It came swiftly and the seller was great, but there is something I wanted to comment on.The lipstick is pretty much exactly the same, but slightly less quality than the one I bought at the store. I compared the two lipsticks and it seems that the one from the store is made of higher quality materials. But it's not as noticeable, I use it all the time anyway."
3,pretty weird,"This is a very strange little flick. It is only 30 minutes long, with many recognizable motorcyclists appearing. Oddly, there isn't any dialogue in the first 15-20 minutes, and there is a fairly appalling bit about the Bin Laden. It wouldn't be so weird if it made sense, but it doesn't.The final part of the movie is great, and it carries through in one of the bonus bits.Overall? Worth watching, but it isn't the best."
4,Easy peasy,"This is an easy ballast to install, wiring diagram on the top is all the information required for someone with experience. If not a google search of the model number result in a more descriptive wiring diagram."
4,Great book,"If you want a great companion book to go with the best of serger books (""Serger Secrets"") ""Serger Savvy"" is the one.Beautiful detailed illustrations, variety of projects: from simple to more sophisticated. The language of the book is easy to comprehend.Highly advised."
1,There are many other titles out there that do a better job,"I own a wide variety of serger books, and this is the worst of the bunch. Everything discussed in this book is addressed more clearly and thoroughly in other books, with better photographs, and this book had absolutely nothing to offer me. Instead, try The Complete Serger Handbook by Chris James for threading, tension adjustments and troubleshooting for different stitch formations (a great beginning serging book) and Sewing With Sergers: The Complete Handbook for Overlock Sewing by Gail Brown and Pati Palmer, a great little paperback that explains how and when to use your serger in the construction of a variety of different garment types so that you needn't confine yourself to patterns that come with serger instructions. But don't throw your money away on this book."
2,Overpriced. Especially for the item that was supposed to come with the phone,"Title says it all.Cisco is selling this adapter separately from their phones. They still need this to operate. Phones do have POE (power over Ethernet) but that is unreliable at best.What would you say if you bought a car and dealer told you that now, you need to buy tires for that car if you want to drive it off the lot?And please, 10 dollars for this!? They make them for bellow a dollar. Rip.Off."
4,Should be included with the phone,"Not so much you can say about the humble power adapter... i plugged it into the wall and the phone and it provided power! :)Though linksys/cisco need to stop being greedy and provide it with the phones.I purchased 3, they are all alive and well."
5,PPPP: Perfect Product at a Perfect Price,"I got 3 of this adapter, all are working fine, the box has Cisco logo and name , the product is perfect and doesn't get overheated like other adapter.I would recommend it for anyone getting Cisco Phone 504G."
4,FL: Toni Jackson,"An excellent introduction to the breed, with some very engaging photographs of some former champions.The breed history and characteristics chapters are clear and informative. There are also a number of chapters to prepare you for new dog ownership with some really sound advice on training and health, thus this makes a great book for new puupy owners."
4,The Best Recent Introduction to Bosch,"I have read most of the monographs on Bosch, and this represents the best recent effort to present Bosch's works on an introductory level. Koldeweij examines Bosch's obscure biography; Vermet discusses the problems of dating and attribution of Bosch's works; Vandenbroeck looks at some of the themes in Bosch's iconography. The only problem with the book is a lack of imagery details. The reproductions are beautiful, but there are not enough of them. The publishers should have made the book much larger with more images. The publishers should have used Charles de Tolnay's huge monograph for a model. As of yet, there is no definitive Bosch monograph that combines Tolnay's amount of image examples and Dirk Bax's exhaustive iconographic analyses. But if I had to pick a good introduction to Bosch and his works, this would be it."
3,Wind chimes,The chimes are about what I expected but would like to have a choice of tone ranges. Service was excellent.
4,Hiking in Colorado's Playground,"My husband and I just moved to Colorado and enjoy hiking. This book helped us find many new and beautiful places in Summit County. We think the directions and maps of the hikes are very helpful however, a warning to those not accustomed to hiking in the mountains may find that the distances and times are sometimes a little off."
5,Bought as a gift,Purchased as a gift for my bf so we could go exploring. Hopefully it will be a good reference book for us to use when we visit.
2,A generalist approach to water.,"A new age approach to the subject of water. Campbell's need to share his philosophy kept me from wanting to read the entire book. What it has to do with water is anybody's guess. But if you're into new age, and don't mind reading spiritualistic trash, this might be your book. Technically correct, the book attempts to be everybody's introduction to anything you ever wanted to know about water. That broad stroke is it's best and at the same time, worst feature."
5,A delightful introduction to Robert Ingersoll,"Creeley has skillfully captured both Ingersoll's blazing integrity and his wonderful insights. There are memorable quotes on nearly every page (On Immortality: ""It is better to ignorantly hope than to dishonestly affirm.""). An excellent reminder that we are all better served by having an open, honest, civil debate about life's most ultimate questions."
2,Hm-mm?,"Trying to figure out if I like the book or not. It is a reasonably paced adventure with frequent sex and loving descriptions of skimpy clothing every few pages.Matter of fact, trying to figure out the author's reason for frequent sex and loving attention to detail on skimpy clothing appearing throughout this book kept me from following the plot.."
2,predictible,"This is the first book I have read by this author. Actually, I didn't really finish reading it. The plot line was juvenile, characters stilted and stereotypical and I got tired of the story line, such as it was, constantly being interrupted by silly sex scenes, minute descriptions of - basically - non- clothing, the heroine wandering around the deep woods naked, etc. Her enhanced genetic make-up didn't seem to have any real value. Actually, if you really want to read a story about rough and tumble ""gold rush"" frontiers, try Jack London."
2,not what I expected,"This was not what I expected. I was looking for the movie, not something about the making of the movie. It was interesting. I guess I did not fully read the excerpt first."
1,I don't like,I watch this but it was boring sorry but this is the worst movie ever never watch this movie1 star
5,"Very Solid, Very Consistent Run of Avengers Tales","Essential Avengers Vol. 4 contains Avengers No. 69-97, along with a crossover tale in the Incredible Hulk No. 140. This is a very solid, very consistent run of comics, all written by Roy Thomas. The series was also blessed with the underappreciated artwork of Sal and John Buscema for almost the entire run presented here, with the great Neal Adams doing a few issues toward the end. The collection ends with the justly-famed Kree-Skrull War, but highlights also include the first appearance of the Invaders, the origin of the Black Panther and the introduction of Red Wolf. The main thing that impresses me when I read through this run is that there were no clunkers among the 30 issues presented, which is hard to find in this kind of collection. For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on the Squidoo website."
5,Great read,"I've read many a television writing book, and this is one of the best of them. Very interesting and educational. I definitely learned a lot! Highly Recommended!"
3,A rather average effort from a great author,"Since reading ""Midnight at the Well of Souls"" when it was first released, Jack L.Chalker has always been an author I have enjoyed reading. This latest effort, like the more recent Well World novels, is not as good as his older stuff. Perhaps if it was the trilogy he originally intended...If you have enjoyed everything else Mr Chalker has written, then you will want to read this too; just don't expect the novel of a lifetime."
2,absolutely no imagination,"Chalker doesn't even bother to create alien life. He just makes them magical. If humans don't have any idea how their science works, Chalker doesn't have to bother writing anything. The characters themselves all have one dimension and no personality. They are stereotypes. The average of what we think a certain type ""should be."" The cops are all cops. The prehistoric man is a prehistoric man.Storyline development is lousy. Character development is nonexistent because there never were characters just Styrofoam. In the end, you don't get what you were looking for.Don't bother unless you are an avid Chalker fan. If you are, you'll clearly give this book 5 stars for no conceivable reason."
2,Don't waste your time.,"To borrow an old quote, ""There's no there there."" This was a poorly thought out book from beginning to end. To bring up the most egregious example, at one point, one of the major characters suffered complete amnesia (for no particular reason, but that's a whole other complaint). Yet, the next time we see her, two chapters later, she is fine and dandy, with full memory and no explanation given. Huh?As is usually the case, Chalker throws around a lot of magic-tech. But this time he throws it out there, and then never bothers to do anything with it - his super-combat suits are an example, they are explained in detail, used in a simulation, and then abandoned. They play no part in the story.A poor book, don't bother."
4,"Engaging characters, plot and world",I found only one copy of this book at a bookstore and then read a little about it on Amazon. I bought it and have to say it was very engaging and I highly rate it. Well developed characters and an interesting plot line. So far I have lent the book to 2 others and they have rated it just as highly as I have. I am not sure why this novel has not gotten more press than it has as a previous reviewer mentioned. I never read any of Chalker's books but after reading this have decided to read more!
1,Egyptian Belly Dance for Intermediates,This is a very beginner DVD. I would not recommend it. The cane dance was the only good part about it.
1,disappointing,"I did not feel this was a video for an Intermediate dancer. Second level beginners may find it useful, but not someone with as little as 6 months of dance classes."
2,Sunny Day is the only track that I like...,"Sunny Day is the only song that is good on here. It's a really nice feel-good song. Unfortunately, the other songs fail to measure up to it. Sorry, Malaya, but you just don't have the voice to pull off the other tracks. Nice job on SD, though!"
3,Had almost no software terminology.,"We purchased this dictionary for use on a software project. Unfortunately, it's amazingly short on computer terminology -- it lacks expressions as common as ""database"" and ""hard disk,"" among others. (I think we found terms for various logic gates. :) For a book published in 1992, this is a serious omission.The dictionary would probably be useful to a translator working in the fields of medicine, engineering, etc., although it consists of nothing but columns of words and phrases in one language with the equivalent expression in the other."
2,not so good,the pieces that are supposed to hold up your bra straps slip with the strap. it is some help but not what i expected.
5,Way better than a Razr!,"This thing does everything a razr can do, but without all the software bugs. Alao, its design is far better, its not so long and wade, it slips right into your pocket because there isnt an antena or sharp edges. Its also very durable, I'v dropped it twice and it still works perfectly, and whatever material surrounds the metal casing is virtually scratch-proof, so it still looks great too."
4,"Awesome phone, crappy battery","This phone is super sexy and has awesome features. It does a lot more than your typical razr phone, I love the voice feature of just being able to say what number i want dialed and it will dial it. No need to program your voice for each name or number, It just knows! The only flaw with this phone is the battery dies SOOO fast! My old phone held a full charge for about 2 days before the battery starts to die, with this phone, the battery is dieing after about 12 hours. Would I buy this phone again?? In a heartbeat!"
4,Girlfriend Loves It!,"My girlfriend has been wanting a new cell & when we saw this one for $99 she couldn't pass it up! I know it's an international phone but was really surpised when everything (manuals, quick guides, etc.) where in Italian but whatever a quick Google search & I had the language changed to English & I was on my way to programming it to work on the AT&T network. I bought an unlocked cell from Amazon before so I knew I wouldn't have a problem getting it to work with AT&T, took all of 10 minutes to input all the needed info & she was in business. This phone overall is pretty sweet, even thinking of picking up a black one for myself. Can't say anything negative about it, but for reviewing sake I'll nit-pick & say that expandable memory would be nice & maybe a better camera but she's not one that lives & dies by her cell's camera, she wanted a cell that not everyone had & she wanted a pink phone, this definitely fit the bill!"
4,PEBL,"It's a great phone - the only annoyance was that it wanted to text in italian and it was a pain to figure out how to change all the language defaults to english. that said, it wasn't a big deal and i'm very happy with it."
2,"Sadly, a big mess that never really works","I really wanted to like this Titanic 4 part mini-series. (All four parts have aired in Canada.) My hopes were that the mini-series would improve after the first episode. It did not. Too many characters, too much jumping around. Mushy story lines that rambled on and then ended for no reason. Computer animation was also mediocre. A few good performances by the actors but overall very poor. If you are hoping to get a little of that upstairs/downstairs ""Downton Abbey"" magic, you won't find it here. Does not work as a drama and has little or no additional historic information. Would love to give this to Walter Murch and ask him edit a decent 90 minutes out of it. As it stands a C- production."
1,Just awful,"I don't know if this will be any better not chopped into 4 segments and interrupted by a zillion commercials, but the TV presentation was the worst Titanic program (of any kind) EVER. And yes, I've watched the Nazi propaganda version.Take four different ""hour"" segments that all go back to pre-sailing, add too many unlikable fictional characters and stir in uninspired sets and nonexistent special effects and you get this abomination. One review said, ""You'll root for the iceberg."" That pretty much sums it up."
5,A Collection of Emotional Stories,"I watched this mini season on ABC and really enjoyed it. It was emotional, touching, and compelling. Hearing all of the life stories of many different passengers was really interesting to me. This show was a great way to honor the 100th anniversary of the Titanic sinking."
2,Learn How to Edit,"The basis of the story was good, but the editing was awful. it should have been in chronological order so we didn't have to see every scene 4 times, and if they didn't have a commercial every 8 min, then maybe it wouldn't have been 4 parts. it could have been a winner."
3,"Interesting, But Not Very Entertaining","This version of Titanic starts just before the voyage and goes to the sinking 4 days later in about an hour. That gives you a overview of how quickly it moves, but unfortunately, not a lot happens during that time. Each of the four episodes goes over the same ground focusing on different characters' points of view. It's S-L-O-W and doesn't really develop any of the story lines very well. What makes it interesting, though, is to see how much class really did matter back then. America was still a land of promise where a person with initiative could achieve dreams of greatness. This really illustrated what it meant to be a ""second class citizen."" It also brought home the unnecessary loss of life due to prejudice and ineptitude.I'd recommend it for those who are interested in the historical aspects of the story or the time period, but if you are looking for something that is enjoyable, this probably isn't it."
5,loved it,"i loved it, it is good to see the story from different perspectives .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .."
2,Kind of disappointed,"I purchased the DVD/BluRay combo, and was looking forward to the disc of Special Features. I was most disappointed to find that it could only be played on a Blu-Ray player, which I (obviously) don't have."
3,Not necessary...,"I was curious to see this because of Julian Fellows attachment, but Downton Abbey it is not. The acting is well done, though no one really stands out, and I found the storytelling and timeline of events disjointed. Obviously the story of Titanic is so tragic, one can hardly enjoy a series about its terrible demise, but I just wasn't all that impressed. So, not a must see."
4,awesome!,"At the beginning I was ill about this show, but after the feeling I had to purchase the rest and watch the show, I was impressed with how this show came about. I liked the Leonardo version, but this one takes the cake. Watching the different people facing the different situations threw a different point of views, I certainly enjoyed the reactions of each actor and how they portray each individual of how they faced the ship that sunk. Even though each person was raised differently in social backgrounds, everyone still has the same issues no matter what background everyone was raised.I totally enjoyed this show, and I hope those who hasn't seen this, I encourage people to sit down and watch this with an open mind."
1,Kind of boring,"I also tried to watch this 4 part movie on tv. I wanted to like it but was unable to do so. There there many many commmercials which made it unbearably long. I also did not like how they kept going backward and forward in time. Like they would start getting into some of the characters stories, then go to the actual tragedy then go to back to character stories again on the ship before the ship hits the iceberg again. The story kept doing this over and over. While I generally don't mind some flashbacks this was ridicuously overdone and boring.I was unable to watch part 4 because the first 3 parts were just very very boring. I remember I was actually falling asleep at times because there was nothing really happening. The story needed to be rewritten and told in a more linear fashion. I would not recommend it."
2,"very nice look, but poorly constructed","The umbrella looked classy, especially liked the pretty wooden handle. Not sure if the shipping/packaging was the problem, but it broke the first time my son opened it!"
1,Not a good product,"This product did not hold up at all. After being laundered only five times it leaked in several places. It is too thin and no different than the vinyl table cloths sold at my local fabric store. Because it is slick on one side, it scrunches up underneath the invalid."
4,Dik's Review,I have learned the hard way that you do not launder these shheets in a washing machine or standard dryer. If you do they will curl severely at the edges and never again lie flat.You must do them by hand in cold water. Do not wad the sheets. I dry themoutdoors or indoors on a wooden laundry rack.
2,Very disappointed,"I had a desperate need for mattress protection but should have been more wary. Not only do these pads slide around on the bed, but when washed according to manufacturer's instructions, the 4 edges curl up, making these pads even lumpier. What's up with that, manufacturer? I feel kind of ripped off, but like I said, I was desperate -- otherwise, I would have returned all 4 of the ones I bought."
5,Duro-Med waterproof sheeting,"My mother who is 91 years old was so happy to have this waterproof sheeting. It fits well on the bed, keeps it dry and doesn't bunch up like one with a plastic back. I purchased two of them, one for under the sheet and one on top of the sheet. This helps me to not have to wash the sheets every day in case of an accident. The thickness of the pad enables her to sit on the bed and then I can put her legs up and help her into the bed with out it bunching up."
3,Do not dry,Ok so I use pads like these for my ferret's. They work good for absorption. Do not work well if you put them in the dryer. If you can't hang them to dry then look for something else. When they are put in the dryer the edges do curl up very badly. I found other pads from Kid-ding that are vinyl backed and they work better for putting in the dryer. I do like these for absorbing the fluid just do not like the fact that I can not put in dryer.
5,solid product does not fail,"The edges will curl/wrinkle with washing. But I prefer these over other incontinence products because they can be washed over and over again in hot water - and never fail to do their job. I have used several products to keep the beds dry, due to an FLUTD cat that spent months urinating all over his favorite places (before he finally needed surgery and went back to the litter boxes). Non-rubber backed products always failed after only a few washings. To keep the full bed dry, I placed two rubber-backed 36x54 sheets (overlapped a bit) just under a flat flannel sheet as a bedspread (so no cat would move the rubber sheets out of place), then only needed to wash the bedspread and rubber-backed sheets - which was often daily. (The lower sheet stayed on overnight, the upper sheet was taken off at night and replaced every morning.) Had the cat continued to have medical issues, I was ready to buy several sets to rotate. Those last minute midnight washings are nerve-wracking."
2,sheet protector ugh,Its too small -Seniors who have dementia just curl it up in a ball and cant get it -What we need is a full size one that tucks in.
3,Rubber Sheeting,"This is adequate, I don't need it that much anymore. It did have a tendency to wrinke and bunch up."
4,nicely made product,"This is a strong, fairly large sheet...it is perfect for what we needed it for, I am glad I found this here on Amazon!"
4,Happy Confusion,"For Boomers who may have missed some of the excitement and confusion in high school during the radical 70s, Finish High School at Home is just the ticket to the lost past. For others, especially those who are put off or flummoxed by adolescents of any day, the novel offers a way to understand and enjoy high school kids. The narrator thinks he's telling the story of his senior year, but he's telling more than that. He reveals the bewilderment and energy of his generation and of every generation as it makes its passage into adulthood. His confusion becomes the reader's pleasure."
5,very nice dinasors,this is the bestest video game in the world. i love beeng aledar and zini and his frend the big taridactl. i forget her name. you get to kill all these reely cute cool dinasors. i love the meat eatings the bestest. aledar gets to push and shove all of them. zini helps aledar by getting fruits and stuff down from the trees. the tractactl does something. i forget what her point is in the game. peeple who says this game is bad shoud take a chil pil. they need a big break. wich reminds me. by a disney dinasor game break games to. thank you for taking my revew seeriosly.
1,Disney should be ashamed,"Lousy graphics, difficult game play. My children lost interest in the first 10 minutes. I am only sorry that I didn't rent it at Blockbuster first before I spent the money on this poor excuse for a Disney game. Do not waste your money on this product."
3,Fast and easy....,"Good for you but kind of bland. I would suggest adding hot sauce or having it as a side-dish to something more spicy. It IS easy to store and cook. Also, there is a lot of rice in each bowl.Brown rice is better for you than white rice BUT a lot of people may not like the taste - it will taste different than polished white rice. Children, for example, may not like it."
2,Wierd flavors... I'd avoid,The white and brown rice is much better. This rice is nothing like I expected... cannot eat without masking the flavor.
4,"Super convenient and very good rice, but a tad pricey","I love this rice because it's both high quality and super convenient.The rice miraculously tastes close to freshly cooked rice and it's super healthy. It's a perfect serving size and goes with just about anything.I have been ordering this rice for several years now, and keep a stock at work. It doesn't need to be refrigerated, and with two minutes in the office microwave it provides a quick accompaniment to lunch or dinner when I simply don't have time to get a proper meal. I'll sometimes mix it with tuna or even eat it plain.I used to keep a stock at home, for late night healthy meals, but recently started cooking rice in large batches that I could then use during the week.In short, I highly recommend this rice, especially for those who are very busy and still want to eat healthfully."
5,brown rice,This item is quick & tasty.Great for college students who do not have time to cook.Highly recommend.We will be purchasing this again in the future!
5,Tasty Organic and Convenient,My family likes brown rice and sometimes we are impatient and don't want to wait an hour or so for the rice cooker. Go Go Rice is a convenient quick way to get organic brown rice in your kids' diet.
5,brown rice bowl,"my find of the year!!!these are so great. just heat them in the microwave for 90seconds.delicious brown rice. no salt. much better than i can make it.i have this on auto delivery every month.just before they deliver, you get an email allowing you to skip that delivery if you choose. i have skipped a delivery.delicious brown rice!"
5,AWE-some,this is fantastic all peoples are so busy so when u need a fast snack stick it in the microwave for 90 seconds go outside look at the sky come inside enjoy some good rice...have a nice day
4,Very Convenient,"Great product for making a quick meal. I usually eat the rice with something else as I think it tastes a bit bland when eaten by itself. The rice when cooked is also quite sticky unlike the rice you would make yourself, but these are minor issues. The quick preparation time (1m 30s) is perfect for what I need and as a plus it is very low in sodium."
4,5 stars for the rice....,"...but I ding the overall score for the excess packaging. The bowls are in a cardboard box which is fine, but the cardboard box is placed in another cardboard box and the excess space is filled up with platic wrap. I understand why this is done, the manufancturer sends the rice boxed and Amazon boxes it again. All that aside, this is a good value and the rice is very good. Also convenient if you don't feel like using a rice cooker or stove top. These are a convenient, quick and nutrious way to get some quality carbs!"
1,beware - moldy!,"I actually had a subscription for this item. The first few shipments were fine, but the last one which was received only a few days ago contained bowls that were full of moldy rice. Ugh. Poor quality control.And what really sucked was that Amazon wouldn't let me return the shipment."
3,"rice is good,shipping sucks!","I didn't expect that much, but the brown rice is really good.I'm asian and kind of picky about choosing rice,but I love it.I'm considering subscribing this product.However shipping is terrible.I ordered 2 set of rice which are 24 packs, they sent only one set at first.I called them and then they again sent only half set of the rice which is 6 packs only.I had to call Amazon again to get another 6 packs.It takes amolst a month to get whole items and I had to call during my break at work everytime.It's frustrating!"
3,how much arsenic does this product contain?,"The November 2012 issue of Consumer Reports contains an article entitled ""Arsenic in your food"". You can read it online. It describes how all rice based food products, even baby foods, contain arsenic, some in very high quantities. Organic seems to have no bearing on the arsenic levels. Brown rice contains even more arsenic than white rice.My wife and I have been eating this product for years. I gave it 3 stars because it is quite good, even though it may be toxic.However, it is time that the manufacturer let us know how much arsenic their product contains."
1,"No flavor, suitable only as bread.","I bought this because of the rave reviews on amazon. When I actually ate a bowl, I found out that this is rice and just rice. No flavor, no seasoning, no taste. It's like buying a microwavable ""lunch"" bowl of bland, raw chicken. Why??"
3,Handy when you are in a hurry.,"I use the cooked brown rice when I need something other than potatoes for dinner. It works well in soups and stews, and as a side dish with butter or gravy. The downside is that some of the packets seem to be dry and clumpy."
5,Great product!,This is an absolutely delicious and easy way to supplement any meal. The price is extremely reasonable and the product is fantastic
4,Brown Rice,We liked the brown rice because of it's convenience and having something healthy to warm up at mealtime with no hassle and no dirty dishes to do.
2,MOLD IN THE BOWLS,"This is a good product and the price was excellent. However, several of the bowls had mold in them when I opened them. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem. It's fairly off-putting, to say the least."
4,I hope they do sales again,"I bought this one for my daughter for Christmas on Amazon at a fire sale price (I can't remember exactly but it was on the order of 10 bucks).Now I believe it is worth the current price though obviously it is less attractive at 44 bucks.Before receiving it, I was a little worried for the quality I was expecting and I must say the surprise was just great.The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is the price which came as a surprise to me today as I came back to buy one for a friend's daughter - it will be a little less slam dunk, though I guess I'll take it anyway."
4,Nice quality material,Bought for a pack n play. They work fine but just a tiny bit too big. I can take care of that by tucking extra material in before placing mattress on the bottom of the crib. Would recommend.
4,It fits Davinci 50 Coil Mini Mattress (5344C),"We bought a mini crib for our baby because our nursery is pretty tight. It was quite a trouble finding the fitted sheet that would fit the 5.5"" thick mattress we chose. This one fits. I gave it 4 stars instead of 4 because I don't like the jersey knit type of cotton this product is made of. I like how soft it is but I don't like how stretchy it is and the fabric is also on the thin side. If anyone knows of a mini mattress fitted sheet with a deep (6""+) pocket that is made of non-jersey cotton, please share info!"
5,Perfect fit for Mini Crib,I purchased the Crescent Mini Crib Mattress and sent for this sheet in hopes that it would fit. It fit perfectly even after washing. Very happy with this purchase.
2,Works ok.,"Not great, but ok. Some reviewers said it works on silver, but it really doesn't. The image also doesn't show that it's for gold and precious stones only."
3,It's okay,"My wedding band didn't shine that much more but it's okay for 7 bucks. I'd say buy this if your looking for something extra. I would give this 2 stars if it cost more than 7 bucks, but it is packaged nicely and has themdipmand brush. But in terms of ""wow"" not really."
4,Seems to work well,"Seemed to work well and leave my jewelry and gems shiny and clean, but I'm not sure if soap and water wouldn't have been any different. Also, it has a familiar smell... after some thought and sniffing I realized it smell like the liquid cleaner used in carpet shampoo systems. Wouldn't be surprised if its the same stuff."
1,Damaged,"Container was cracked and leaking upon arrival. I had to throw it out. Thank goodness it was in a separate plastic bag so my other purchases were not soaked. Not worth cost to return, so my loss."
5,Great product!,I love this product. I use it for my engagement and wedding rings to make them sparkle again. Makes a huge difference and they look as good as new.
1,Don't Use on Silver,"I have a silver chain that was tarnished. Putting it in this cleaner made it 100 percent worse. I used the brush and tried dipping two times, and it came out almost pure black. This product should state that it's not for use with silver."
3,Eh it's okay...,"First thing - the brush that comes with this is so tiny it's pointless. Sorry but it just really didn't work for me. No I don't have giant hands, but the thing is tiny! I ended up using an old toothbrush which made a big difference!However, I don't think this works solution works that great. I left a pretty tarnished sterling silver bracelet for about 1 hour then scrubbed. Didn't see a big difference, so I chanced it and left over night. Scrubbed again, but didn't really make it look like new (like a lot of other review say). It worked better on a couple rings, but not on a necklace. I probably wouldn't buy again or recommend."
2,Didn't notice a difference.,"I used this on various different materials and different stones, and none seemed any more brilliant afterwards. Perhaps my nicer jewelry (gold, precious stones) just weren't dirty enough? Don't bother for silver or costume jewelry."
5,Wow. Just wow.,"I received this today and used it to clean my sapphire engagement ring that I've been wearing for a little less than 2 months. I was definitely starting to look dull and dingy, but this cleaned it right up in 30 seconds! Looks as good as new - the sparkle is back and the color looks great again! I would definitely recommend this product. I expect this jar to last me quite a while, but I will most likely purchase this again when I need to as well.I only wish I'd taken before and after pictures, because the difference is so striking!"
5,Best jewelry cleaner ever!,This is the best jewelry cleaner I have ever used. In just 30 seconds your gold & diamonds look as shiny and new as when you have them cleaned at the jewelry store. I will continue to use this for years to come!
5,Great product.,If you have diamond jewerly you need this product. It works great. I use it once or twice a week to shine up my diamond ring.
4,Solid Jewelry Cleaner,"This is a really good cleaner for the price. My one issue with it is that when I clean my engagement ring and then rinse with lukewarm water, it doesn't look as clean and bright until a few hand washes afterwards. So, don't be concerned if when you pull it out of the solution it doesn't blow your socks off, it will in a few washes!"
2,Doesn't seem to clean silver!,I read reviews that claims this product will clean silver- it does not! I hate to waste my money based on poor reviews.
4,Ok product!,First off I gave 4 stars because the product is overall a good buy at the price. The inside cleaning area that you can remove doesn't fit that great inside so it will float on its side a bit and you have to dig it out instead of being able to pull it right out. The cleaner seems to work well on my ring and other jewelry and at this price I guess having the inside tip isn't too bad of a deal ; )
3,disappointing,"The author steps on his own story with tendentious justifications for the terror. Despite having such vivid material to work with, his narrative never really gains much steam. It's much inferior to R. R. Palmer's classic Twelve Who Ruled. Or, if you're looking for a modern interpretation, try Doyle's Oxford History of the French Revolution instead."
2,Interesting subject - very poor writing,This could have been an excellent book but unfortunately the author's writing style makes it unreadable. I can't remember a book with this many unintelligible sentences. Don't waste your money.
4,great starting point,This book is a great starting point in your self-study. It will not be the only book you need due to it's lack of all exclusivity. It's a bit of a rewiew book but it doesn't include all the knowledge you will ever need to ace the MCAT (but what book does?). The book excels at providing an excellent overview of how you should study as well as what you should study. From the content list the book provides I can easily go online and research a specific topic. With my busy life I don't have time to read 100 textbooks. Since the MCAT is testing your ability to apply knowledge and not regurgitate it this method works for me. I don't regret buying this book.
1,Not Relevant,Having just taken the MCAT I would definately reccomend that you dont use this book. The material it covers just is not applicable to the MCAT. The book definitely has difficult questions but I didnt see a single question like this on the MCAT. Your time is better spent taking real practice exams instead of working on these problems. If you do buy the book dont be discouraged if you have trouble with the problems because this is NOT an accurate reflection of the real MCAT.
5,Awesome series I cant wait for season 2!,"I personally never watch any TV series really haven't gotten into the whole reality TV kinda of a cheers, and wonder years guy..... but Wow this show is right up there frickin funny from the start to end watch one episode guys and you gotta see the rest great show thanks cast and crew.Ryan"
2,annoying,I dislike this show and find the dog to be too mean. In order to enjoy watching a show I need to like some of the characters but there aren't any. My twenty-something year old niece loves it and finds it hilarious. There are some funny parts but I can't get past the dog who doesn't fit my image of what a dog's personality is like.
3,It's okay,"Its kinda funny but it was difficult to get into. I bought the first three episodes, I don't regret buying them but I don't want to buy anymore."
2,It's Ok,"The premise is quirky & neat, but doesn't do enough to carry the lackluster plot, and dull scenes. The stories are just ok, the relationships have cute moments, but ultimately the dialogues begin to feel repetitious very quickly."
1,Silly and not funny at all,"I thought this series was poorly written and performed. I am a fan of many TV comedies, but this one did nothing for me. The premise of the series cold have been really funny, like the movie 'Ted', but the jokes fall flat and the raunchy humor is old and stale."
3,kinda funny,Its more fowl language than i expected. So i can't share this with my entire family. Funny stuff but certainly more juvenile than i thought it was gonna be.
2,Eh.,"I was looking forward to this series given the premise, but the whole emphasis on drugs and being ""bad"" was irksome. The opening scene is pretty funny and there are a few comedic moments, but I'm not going to continue watching this series. Sorry Mr. Wood, I'm going to stick to your other stuff."
4,Very cute & affordable watch for girls between 4 - 8 yrs.,"This is a very cute & elegant looking watch , I took it for my niece. I am sure she will love it."
5,A Must in any Classical Violin Collection,"The recording is crisp and superb. Ms Brown gives a very pleasing interpretation of this piece of Vivaldi's work. Her playing is clean, bright and energetic. The energy and moods are easily felt by the listener. I recommend this CD to both anyone who is just starting to enjoy classical music as well as the seasoned listener who enjoys the baroque era and is building a collection of Violin masters. When this CD was first released several years ago I searched high and low and couldn't find it. All sold out everywhere. I was so happy to learn Hanssler did another issue and now I finally have my own copy."
2,Not for me,"Please understand that I rate this book based on my ability to enjoy the content, not on its merit by any other standard. And, unfortunately, I have a life-long aversion to poetry (other than some tasteless bits of doggerel, like vulgar limericks).I hoped that the subject matter, about which I'm passionate, would help me overcome this revulsion. I tried, I really did, but it was not to be. Many people tell me about the great pleasures they experience in poems, but that pleasure remains inaccessible to me. I wish other readers all the enjoyment there is to be had in this collection. I can not, based on my personal experience, call this at all enjoyable.-- wiredweird"
1,C.P.R. NEEDED,"What a disappointment! I ordered PASSIONATE HEARTS as a gift for newlyweds and must return it to AMAZON because it is so weak. A very few good poems surrounded by many unimaginative, cliche-ridden, excusses for poetry. This book needed CPR from a editor who hears the vigorous heartbeat and ecstacy of fine literature instead of the fragmentary palpitations of 2nd-rate amateurs."
5,Mr Putter and Tabby never disappoint!,"Mr. Putter & Tabby Write the Book (Mr. Putter & Tabby)My children and I have been reading the Mr Putter and Tabby series by Cynthia Rylant for a long time. I was pleased to see that four new ones had come out since I last checked. So I bought them all. The characters are sweet but realistic--an old man and his sweet old cat, Tabby. Their temperaments are perfectly suited to each other so they have wonderful (but not too wild) adventures together. Tabby is always cat-like which as a cat lover, I appreciate. Mr. Putter has ambitions to write a book but finds it a bit more strenuous than he expected. I love the illustrations of Tabby especially--she is so expressive. I enjoy these stories as much as my kids do."
4,EPC1000HE does not fit,"The case has a good amount of padding and some great storage. If you are looking at this for your ASUS EPC 1000, keep looking. The case is not as wide as the netbook. It will fit if you push it in, but the sides bulge, makeing it difficult to zipper."
5,Blast from the Past,"Oh Yeah! Here it is, some awesome footage never before realesed of DOA live in San Francisco during the bands many early dates of 1980-1981. Watch Randy Rampage never stand still, in fact the whole band is fun to watch, super fast drummer. This single camera footage in color is a great look into the past of this very early punk/hardore band who continue to perform live to this day. The DVD also contains footage from Stanley Park in Vancouver BC where we see the cops turn up and question what is happening while giving out parking tickets. DOA end up performing and take time out to talk with the camera crew. Who would have thought there was footage from way back then, who had access to a camera in 1978??? A great DVD for sure."
2,Lacking...,"I've been lucky to dive a number of places around the world, primarily from traveling with the military, and this book doesn't cover any of the better places that i am aware of. There are reefs in the Caribbean that are considerably more amazing than anything pictured in this book.This book might not be bad for someone looking for options, but i would return to some of the places i've already been to before i'd be interested in seeing more of what is covered in this book.Printed in China."
2,"Poorly informative, misleading title, inappropriately big","It has LITTLE information, FEW dive sites around the world coveredThe name ""dive in style"" may cause misunderstanding. The less vague name should be ""luxurious dives"" as all accommodation it suggests are high-end resorts.It has too few information for anyone to plan any trip, unless you're too rich to care about planning - just call the resorts and you are there.At some point, I felt like this is more of a underwater photograph book, but frankly the photos are not that beautiful.The big size of the book is really more suitable for a photography book than a guide book. The info is always written in small fonts in the corners of the pages, while the photos which should be for reference only cover nearly whole pages like forcing readers to look at the photos. Really annoying.Well, unless you're millionaire, who is also ignorant, you should never buy this book.I regret buying it."
3,some great pictures,This book had some great pictures but didn't inspire any dive trips. Mostly high end resorts that are WAY out of our price range. If you are a Four Seasons fan than these might be for you.
1,BEWARE!,"Chances are, you will not like this game.Based on a positive review from another reviewer (5 stars!), I took a chance on this game when it was available very cheaply through a marketplace seller. I figure I got what I paid for the game (which wasn't much!), but I would be *mad* if I had paid full price.The problems: the interface is awful and moving the camera is a chore, the translation is bad, the voice acting is bad, all of which would be forgivable if the game play was redeeming--it isn't. The bottom line is that this game was not fun for me despite being a fan of the genre.If you do decide to take a chance on this game, don't pay more than bargain bin prices because you are definitely getting a bargain bin game."
2,Adequate,"As a coarse-bearded person, I have found this product requires generous lathering to be serviceable. Expect to relather multiple times during your shave.If purchasing a comercial shaving soap, I would recommend you search for one that at least advertises a glycerin base. This soap feels as if there is little (if any) glycerin, let alone clay. Colgate's website has no information available.There are many handmade soaps available via E-Bay that are far superior to this."
3,Not so fun,"When I got this I played it right away. It was sooooo boring. It was like the normal monopoly, but about a little golf. I like golf, but this is just boring.I can hit 60 yards. Well,this has nothing to do with golf. So choose wisely if you want it."
1,Game Sucks,"I rember waiting for this game and when it came it was every sad.First the controls for this game sucks,secondly i couldn't even get past the first level i don't even now you get past it i tried reading the manual many time that didn't help then tried the internet that worked fo crap also.Third- the weponds for this game suck you have to use a axe on a monster thing and it takes forever for the damn thing to die.Lastly the map for this game is so confuseing it was just blocks that pointed in differnt dicrtions.IF you like doom and quake STICK TO THAT cause this game sucks and it's not even fun i think pac-man for the Atari 2600 is Funier than this garbage.If i were you and if you were looking for a doom type game get PO'ED much funier than this."
3,A VERY fictional book.,"This book was kind of ""out there"" and it didn't make since. I know that it was ment to be a fiction book, but Bill Britain went too far. Someone growing wings, and hiding out with someone who had 6 fingers? I don't think so. It did have a good moral though. ""Everyone should be treated equaly. It doesn't matter what you look like."" Read it if you'll enjoy seriously fictional books!"
4,One of a few,"There are, very few books that are written about people flying. Flight beyond airplanes always intersted me, so ofcourse I like the book. It is written from a different point of view, how would it be like to fly? How could someone know what that was like? Ask a bird? So, apart from being a little off as far as the rules of flight, it was, a injoyable book. I read it twice in one day just for the thrill of wishing I was there... It also has quite a surprise ending!"
2,Poor Quality,"Knowingly that it was from a duplicate and the video contents were from some time ago, the quality is poor and it only containend 4 videos. I believed it would have the majority of the concert as advertised."
2,spring has already broke,I have four boys and one who is interested in kicking and the spring broke only after a couple of uses. would purchase a different product next time.
4,"Great show, but too much nationalist sentiment","On the whole, I really enjoyed the show. However, they went a little overboard with the whole nationalist sentiment...India is the land of virtue and America is morally bankrupt...thing. Having lived in South Asia, and being married to a South Asian, there are great things about both places, and to portray the diasporic community as out of touch with their roots simply because they live elsewhere is a disservice to the truth. That said, it is still a very enjoyable show."
4,Mexican arts,"The information regarding the history and locations of different materials/arts is well researched. The photographs are mediocre. The photographer was not knowledgeable re: lighting. It is great for information only. It is not a ""special"" - ""beautiful"" book for the coffee table."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"If you liked Blue Highways You won't like this book. The author is so full of himself it is difficult to get through the first chapter. By the second chapter I was praying that ""River Horse"" would sink with the loss of all hands."
5,Awesome Fun,"Story CreatorMy kids aboslutely love this toy. My four year-old plays with it more than the seven year-old. Anyway, this has provided my kids with hours of entertainment and my wife and I with hours of joy listenning to them play without fighting or needing our attention."
1,Highly inaccurate.,"Unfortunately, Mrs. Rogers engages in a very, very selective interpretation of the events surrounding the downing of the Iranian civilian airliner on July 3, 1988. Furthermore, the FBI's only real suspect for the ""terrorist"" bombing of Mrs. Roger's van was a former personal friend of the Rogers who held a grudge. All in all, this is not an accurate portrayal of the regrettable events surrounding the Iran Air 655 incident."
1,Airline Tragedy,"I read this book and found many inaccuracies. Mr. Rogers was in Iran's territorial waters when he killed 290 people, including 66 innocent children. First of all, i could not believe that he is trying to profit from their deaths. I guess it wasn't enough that he and his crew all received medals for successfully downing a commercial airliner. Secondly, I thought he would have expressed some remorse for murdering all those innocent people, but nothing to that effect was found in the reading. If I were him, thank God im not, b/c i have a conscience, I would probably have gone crazy if I had ordered the murder of all those people...including 66 innocent children. And they call Iran a terrorist state? Imagine that."
3,Lava Plant,"The tree it's self is very nice but the pot is faulty and it leaks, because a large hole in the bottom of the pot is filled with silicone and it moves around. They will not replace it unless you pay the shipping charge.The leak is not my fault, it is a poorly made product and I refuse to pay shipping when they should have included a solid pot."
5,Best electric razor for the money,"I bought this razor based on the recommendations from all the Amazon and [...] users, and they were right. It has a powerful and fast little motor that does a fabulous job. The shave is as close as I have ever received with an electric. It cuts without irritation and charges fairly quickly.I would recommend this over other razors due to its price in comparison and its ease of use. Replacement parts are not cheap for this razor, but compared to Braun or the other ones out there it is about the same.Only thing I would note is that it is NOT a triple blade razor, but it does have three screens. The blades seem to overlap within the third screen, but it does not have three blades. That doesn't seem to make any difference though."
4,"Implausible beginning, but better later on","This book is well-written and has characters who engage the reader's attention. The main characters take awhile to warm up, which is unusual for a Dorothy Mack book.Another departure from the usual Dorothy Mack novel is that the hero has flaws which he must struggle to overcome.In reference to the other reviewer's plaint about concern over reputation, the heroine is specifically depicted as having no knowledge of the ton and its rule. Plus, she has no reputation to lose, since her father is so adamantly against her taking a place in society. The hero is in an emotional state where the state of his reputation matters not at all.Once the characters are embarked on their ""mission"", the book gets better. I felt that the main weakness of the book is how the minor characters are developed and then abandoned."
5,Lush sound and technically brilliant!,"Ohlsson, the technical giant, doesn't need to 'show off' in this concerto, but the technique is brilliant when needed. The cadenza in the first movement starts very pianissimo and builds to a huge climax. The sound is gorgeous and the orchestra is bathed in a lush sound. Its one of the most beautiful Grieg Concertos recorded."
1,madeleine,i think lost in the everglades was a little freaky cause there are some scary parts.but you never suspect who was the bad guy.
5,the series that keeps my eyes open even at 11:00 pm,"I'm a 10 year old girl, and I've just started reading the Nancy Drew series. They are exciting, and they don't ever tire me!! I like reading a lot and love mysteries. I've only read 2 or 3 but I'm still not tired from them. So far my favorite book has been Lost in the Everglades. I liked trying to figure out who was a good guy and who was a bad guy. I was a little surprised when I learned Jade was the bad guy. I'm going to keep reading them. Thanks Carolyn Keene for writing the Nancy Drew books."
4,EMS So Unreal that it has to be Real,"Novel features EMS in NYC in late 1970s. The author was a 911 paramedic for more than 20 years in NYC. She weaves together a fascinating tale of paramedics, police officers, and homeless citizens (skels) with famous literature and music.I have no doubt that most of the patient encounters detailed in the book are true or loosely based on the truth. So much in EMS is beyond imagination - the injuries, how people live, the larger than life personalities - that little embellishing is needed to craft a fictional narrative.Most EMS literature is first hand accounts of working as a paramedic where the author is the main character and the plot is their life. The themes are the lessons the author learned working as a paramedic. Since Skels is a novel the author, Maggie Dubris, was able to write a plot with several twists, plant characters early in the book that play a central role together, and write about themes of counter culture, addiction, family, and moral ambiguity."
4,A Bone To Pick,"I am an avid fan of Charlaine Harris, and hope to aquire all her writings eventually. This book, ""A Bone To Pick"", was different from other novels I have read by Miss Harris, and I must say I did enjoy it. When you start out reading Charlaine Harris' True Blood series first, the Sookie Stackhouse set, and her other later ""True Blood""novels, its like experiencing her writings backwards. I mean to say that you can see her developing into a first rate, sought after author. I just cannot wait to read more of her works in the future, and I will be a fan forever."
2,Kind of a let down...,"I enjoyed ""Real Murders"" and the character Aurora Teagarden. I don't want to give away too much, but in ""A Bone to Pick,"" it's as if Ms. Harris decided to change Aurora's character completely. Accordingly, the book feels very transitional: a lot of deliberation and very little action. That's not the Aurora Teagarden I thought I knew!"
3,"Don't Look a Gift ""House"" in the Mouth","""A Bone to Pick"" is the second book in the cozy mystery series featuring Georgia librarian Roe Teagarden. In this story, Roe is surprised to find out that she has inherited a large sum of money and a house from Jane Engle, an older lady who was a member of The Real Murders Club in their Georgia town. (The first book was all about the Real Murders Club). This story was fun but didn't have much mystery in it at all. The big mystery is that Roe discovers a skull hidden in the house she inherits, and most of the story revolves around Roe trying to determine whose skull it is. There is also a bit more development of Roe's love life.This is a fun series, I just think this story wasn't as exciting as the others I've read in the series. I enjoy the characters, though, and I'm glad I got the background information on how Roe inherited her money."
3,Not that much of a mystery,"Like some reviewers have mentioned, Aurora Teagarden Mysteries are not actually mysteries. Rather, these books are about Roe's life, with a little bit of a mystery thrown in, mostly in the end of the books. I personally didn't mind that. Charlaine Harris has that special talent of describing everyday life of an ordinary person (in this case, Aurora's) and lives and gossip of a small town in a very entertaining manner. Although this series lacks uniqueness of the supernatural world described in the Southern Vampire series, it is still very engaging, and I will continue reading it."
1,Why do I care about Aurora?,"I have read all the other series by Charlaine Harris and enjoyed them thoroughly. I loved Sookie, Lily, etc..but when it comes to Aurora I am not sure why i am supposed to care about her. She is very flat. She could be killed in a murder and I would not care one way or the other. If you are a true Charlaine fan based on her other novels I would stay clear of this series. It is really lacking...."
4,A Bone to Pick/Aurora Teagarden book 2,A nice easy read with an interesting story line. If you have read the Sookie Stackhouse books first and enjoyed the steamy romance you will be disappointed with the romance here.
3,"Great characterization, with a skull on the side","I liked ""Real Murders,"" and looked forward to continuing the series. This book was an enjoyable and very light read, but it didn't contain the same level of integration of character development and mystery. The mysterious skull didn't provide enough urgency to keep me completely engrossed. I genuinely enjoyed meeting new characters in the story; Harris has a gift in creating three dimensional people in very few words. I also liked getting to know Roe better. I just felt like this story simply didn't meet the bar set by ""Real Murders."" I'll give the series another chance, though, as I see a lot of potential in the characters."
2,Bit of a let-down,"The entire premise of the book was rather ridiculous, but the reasoning behind what Jane did and why she did it (well, before she died) was great. I just wish it had all been written WELL. I can't get over how ridiculous the rest of the premise is, and a lot of the time what Aurora does in the book is dictated more by what has to happen in the book rather than by logical reasoning. I suppose Real Murders was 5-6 years ago in book time, but when did she get to be such a... I guess ""waste of space"" is the term I'm looking for.Another review feels the same way and assures me that book 3 is better, so off I go to the third one.(And, okay, I might be jealous of that windfall.)"
4,A Bone to Pick,"This is the second book in a mystery series. Aurora Teagarden, a librarian, inherits a house and a large sum of money from her friend Jane. While Roe is cleaning out the house, she finds a skull in a storage trunk. Roe begins to investigate where the skull came from and how it ended up in Jane's house. Good twists and turns in this book, I enjoyed it. I will continue this series.[...]"
4,Just Plain Fun,"This is not a book that's going to make it to the big screen, the little screen or any other screen. It's just an entertaining book for those of us who don't want to spend the first 20 pages reading about the color of the sky. The fact of the matter is, spending time with Roe and people in her life is just plain good old fun with a little mystery added. I enjoy going dress shopping with Roe. I like knowing what she had for breakfast. I care about the cat curling up in her lap. On face value this sounds very mundane but therein lies the talent of Charlaine Harris; she can take the ordinary and make it interesting. Looking forward to the next book in the series."
3,A solid read,"Nothing fancy, but a good solid read on a cold night. This is early Harris, and it shows why she attracted such a following before the Sookie-boom."
2,Average,Nothing was exciting about this book. It was predictable and quite a letdown from the books I ordinarily read I would not recommend it./
3,Simple but Complicated,"The Wheel works fine when i have it set up as a gamepad type controller, but technically thats not what it is.i personally purchased the wheel to play Arca Simracing 2008the manual is simple and vague. there are adittional functions that are not explained in the manual. and for some reason when it is set up as a wheel type controller it just jerks back and forth erraticallyoverall i would say you can get buy with it but unless you can find results to the problems you may encounter dont waste your time"
1,junk,"went thru two of these in about a month. same issue both times, gas pedal becomes irratic then stops working all together as well as the steering squeekie loose like its been used for many years. don't waste your time or money!"
3,"Interesting, but not essential","This is a compilation of various articles about David Bowie, most of them previously published in music magazines and a few written especially for the book. What makes this book interesting is the inclusion of some historical pieces, such as the infamous ""I'm gay"" interview for Melody Maker in 1971. On the other hand, some essays are too pretentious and will only appeal to those who enjoy getting into the ""intellectual"" side of David's music. If you're planning to write a doctoral thesis on Bowie some day, this book is for you."
3,Bowie Academia/Trivia at its Finest,"The introduction is a rather scholarly summation of the book's contents; the rest of the book consists of articles from pre-1972 to the eighties. It does shed an interesting light on Kenneth Pitt's role as manager of Bowie for the four years preceding the changeover to MainMan Productions, and the Svengali management of Bowie's career. The book also contains the much-coveted Patti Smith review, ""Communique"" (a review of the album ""Heroes"")."
3,"Basic, Basic, Basic!!!","The book offers extremely limited ""trainer"" information, and delivers basic common sense information. If you interested in learning more about the field, there are far better ""basic"" books available on the subject. The format of the book is poorly structured, and doesn't convey needed training knowledge."
3,Solid Basic Guide for First Time Trainers,"If you have a generic training session to conduct, and want a quick, large format guide to training and training preparation, this is a reasonable choice. I used a few of the checklists for course design. However, for computer training needs, there are better choices such as Paul Clothier's Computer Training book. For general practice and theory of adult learning, I would recommend Robert Pike's Training Techniques book."
4,Solid Basics Here,Kroehnert delivers sold basics here. That's why I keep this book as part of my training library.
2,dating or Marriage?,The problem is that the author is an experienced 'Dater' of Jewish men. She hasn't taken the step to marry one and see all the problems arise. Doron Kornbluth's Why Marry Jewish (written for Jews and non-Jews) deals with the surprises that come after the wedding - many of which would surprise the author.
1,Surely you jest,"There's very little that I can say about this book, and none of it is positive. Besides being stereotypical, which many people have already noted, I find this book to be a complete waste of time.Seriously, what is the point of this? This isn't a unique, cool idea. It's another attempt at someone trying to ruin something that's beautiful and sacred. I really hope nobody will take this book seriously, because the truth is that there's a lot that this book isn't saying. A better book title might be, ""As a Jew, should I marry a Jew?"" which would go along nicely with ""As a (blank), should I marry a (blank)?""As a Jewish man with many Jewish friends, I can't imagine why anyone would be crazy enough to date us. We're not as charming as Seinfeld would have you believe, and most of us would be ""a world of trouble"" for anyone. ""Shiksa's"" be warned, Jewish men are not what Kristina Grish would have you believe."
1,You'll learn nothing new,"A good friend gave me this book for my birthday this year. If you've dated a Jewish man for 6+ months, you will learn nothing new. My best relationships ever have been with caring, intelligent and tenacious men who were raised in Reformed or Conservative households. While this presented challeges aside from the usual problems that arise in relationships, I was exposed to a culture that has transcended thousands of years and is rich in tradition. I learned to love the culture quickly...and no book can replace that experience for this Episcopalian."
1,Being in love with being in love with Jewish men,"Vapid, trite, and stereotypical. Not all Jewish are good husbands. That's why there's divorce. As for the Jewish male's alleged appreciation of women, every Jewish male is to thank the Lord every morning for not having made him a slave, a woman, and a gentile. Draw your own conclusions about that.Why do Grish and and other gentile women think the vile and despicable word shiska is funny? It derives from the Hebew word for abomination. Is that what they think they are? If they do, they have a great lack of self respect. After all, do Native American women call themselves squaws? Do African-Americans call themselves schwartzes? I think not."
5,Duro-Med 4 Ply 28 x 36 Quilted Reuseable Bedpad,Thick and durable. Have been using these for quite a while and they do great even after daily washing.
2,not so much...,moved around a bit too much for our purposes (help w/ toilet training for my 4 yr old) and bed ended up wet anyway - if we put it under the fitted sheet it helped keep the mattress safe but kind of defeats the purpose
2,Marker is permanent!,"These books are great for learning, but don't let your toddler get the marker on their clothes!!! It does NOT come out! I have tried everything!"
5,Cute kids book,This is a great quiet book for church or doctor's office. The pen included was a great idea. Nice gift for my grandson!
4,Repetitive pages,"I agree with some reviewers... marker wipes off the pages easily, but stains do not come out of clothes. And I like that the pen is not attached with a string so that the child has freedom to move it around; and since it has a built-in penholder, it is easy to keep track of the pen. We also have the ABC's book, which my granddaughter loves! However, the activities in this book are the same for each ""thing that goes"". So, she got bored with it very quickly."
5,My Money Personality,"I just have to rave about Susan's book, The Power in Your Money Personality. I am a professional financial planner with a CPA and a law background. Not once in may career have I come across such a powerful message. Susan's book opened my eyes to many of the misconceptions that my clients and I myself hold with respect to money and personal finances. Her words and humor have disolved years of anxiety that I have been carrying around. Thank you, Susan!"
5,The Power in your Money Personality,"I love this book!! Susan helps you understand an emotionally difficult subject in a light hearted, non-threatening way. Not only has this book helped me in my personal quest to better understand the connection between the behavioral and the pshychological components of money, but I also use the information in my money managment classes. It is straight forward and easy to grasp. A great read!"
3,Works well enough,"This pad is of a good quality, but if you plan on using it for a child's bed, it does move around and bunch up. It's big enough, but because I can't secure it, it doesn't work so well for nighttime accidents. Otherwise, it's really well made and easy to use."
5,Great product,"Very nice! Washes well! I place it between my fitted sheet and mattress protector -- that way if their is an accident, I still have the mattress protected until I get the pad washed."
1,leaks through,"I got these pads to protect my carpet from a new puppy. At first I thought they worked fine since the puppy was using them. Then I turned them over and found both the back side and my carpet was damp. I would return them but it is beyond the return date. Don't buy these pads, they don't hold water."
2,Jog-trot Bach at its worst,"Hannsler has afforded Helmut Rilling some of the best modern soloists ever to sing Bach, including the sublime Thomas Quasthoff. Here in this dry, mechanaical, and badly recorded St. John Passion we get Michael Schade, Juliane Banse, Andreas Schmidt, and Matthias Goerne, no less. You could dip in with pleasue just for them.But Rilling comes from the bad old school of Bach conducting, and jog-trot rhtyhms abound. This is such a stiff, unmusical reading, not to mention the painfully strained sopranos in the chorus lunging at their top notes, that I found it hrd to get through. However, the good news is that you can buy an entire CD of Quasthoff's contributions to Rilling's Bach (he doesn't sing here), which partially makes up for the dismal remainder."
1,wrong item,"You sent wrong item. The one I ask for has the weigths with plastic protectors, the one you sent does not! Now the net is in Bogota Colombia and is very expensive to return it back. Next time, please be more carefull about you are sending the correct item. If possible you should send the rigth one.RegardsJaime OchoaBogota DC, Colombia"
2,Statistics,"This book is not nearly as good as some of the other stats books I've used, but it's old and cheap."
5,Wonderful video,"This documentary is a joy to watch! I have enjoyed seeing it over and over again. If you like ballet, you must have it!"
5,Great book!,"I love this version!It's one of the better ones as far as the translation goes...I also love this one for it's cover... I have 3 kids, and when I go to church I am holding hands and can't hang onto a bible as well...This one is perfect! I keep it in my purse, and it gets banged around all the time, but never get messed up!The cover has yet to open on me when I didn't want it to! LOVE IT!"
4,"Metal Bible; New Living Translation, Silver Cross (Heavy Metal Bible Series","I found this bible outstanding for a military man.I can just throw it in my pack or cargo pocket about destorying it. it is great as a gift to a soldier sailor or marine overseas, the normal paper would get destroyed by the constant mosture of pack and cargo pockets the metal case does wonders I love it would be great as a giftI just made they made all bibles this tough"
1,IGIA Dermabrasion System,Broke in 4 days. Machine no longer works and the sponge attachment came unglued from its base. Overall poor quality.
3,stinky.smells like kerosene . very thin material,"I was expecting a more rugged backpack . No reinforced bottom of the back pack . Smells horrible ,smells up the the entire house. The quality is not good .very thin material is used ."
3,"Looks great, but does it function well?","Got this recently and everything looked okay, until the plastoc belt buckle broke. I didn't apply any unnecessary pressure to it, just the buckle was incorrectly made (a size too big) I would give it a four if the inconvience didn't happen."
2,to small,"I'm a large guy imagine an offensive lineman... that's me. This bag is tiny for a larger guy. The straps fully extended and put over my shoulders made the bag look like it was for a child. The ""Waste strap"" is pointless for a tall person (i'm 6' 3"") because it connects above the belly button which will give 0 support I will end up cutting them off since they are also not long enough for a larger man. I can't blame the bag for my size but I can blame them for not listing length of the straps so that I could size it up before purchasing. In a man sizing chart I would say that the bag would be good for someone who wears a size XL shirt or smaller. If you wear anything over XL in a shirt then stay away from this bag."
3,OK,Pack is ok. Spend 10 more dollars and get a better one. I wish I did. This pack will soak water not repelit.
3,Ok Quality,"This product is of decent quality, it feels sturdily built, I would prefer if the buckles weren't plastic and the shoulder straps were a little bit larger. But this doesn't bother me too much, that earns it a 4 star rating for me. It loses a star however because the picture makes it looks more dusty and less of a forest color, more brown. When I received the bag I was surprised because it was so deep and dark green I thought it was a different pack."
5,Great book!,"This book is timeless and a great review of major scientific discoveries. It subtly suggests that the greatest discoveries are not due to the greatness of man, but by pure accident except for the Providence of God. It becomes obvious when chapter after chapter illustrate the accidental discoveries of amazing concepts cannot be due to the intellectual greatness of Man, but must be the hand of the beneficent God.Suitable for all ages though younger children may have challenges with some vocabulary."
1,Waste of paper,If you looking for practical algorithm or finding way to implement some cg work..This book is *NOT* for you. This book says 'there is beuatiful rainbow over there and Here is picture' and that's it It show nothing about how to get there. It present several beautiful image made by some algorithms but it says nothing about that algorithm..what is this ? this book is not tutorial or serious book . Just waste of paper..
1,A real Lack of Information,"I bought this book for class at my technical college. Although mine was a second edition it read like an unrevised draft, edited only for grammatical errors. The inside cover even lists objectives for the Server 2003 exam, not the XP pro. exam. I took the 70-270 exam yesterday and earned a 610. About 30% of the questions pertained to information that this book either never mentions or does not cover adequately. Questions asked at the end of the chapters are frequently worded poorly or can't be answered using the book. Don't waste any more time looking at this book or this review, go back and choose something that has positive reviews. I went to the bookstore and browsed their XP pro. books after the exam. The difference was night and day!"
1,Lousy book!!,"This book is awful,asks questions in chapter reviews that are either not in the book or in another chapter. I wasted untold hours of my life in this book.I have strongly recomended that the school I attend stop using this worthless piece of trash."
2,"Poor quality, no LabMentor CD bunded with Amazon","Its not Amazon's fault that this book isn't really good. The information contained inside it is out of date, written during the time of XP's release.The major drawback is this book does not contain the LabMentor Online Lab disk, which prevents me from completing most of the course work for me class."
5,A must have.,"If you've got a laptop and you take it out of your domicile to use without having a lock, what the heck is the matter with you!Get this one, easy to use, great price, and no numbers to memorize."
2,REDUNDANT,"This is a three story compilation. I bought it in hopes that there would be three different stories included. I found the sex scenes redundant. I was surprised that she used the same verbage verbatim to describe her sex scenes in each of the three novels. Maybe if these stories were not read back to back they would be more tantalizing, but if you've read one you've basically read all three."
4,Enjoyed these stories and passed them on.,Not sure if these are the best of Jaid Black but they are worth the read. I have read a couple others I liked better. Looking foreward to reading more of Jaid's work.
4,A Very Good CD,"Ralph Stanley joins up with some of the best bluegrass voices to ever be recorded with the album containing some vocals by Keith Whitley, Roy Lee Centers and Ricky Skaggs.While not quite as good as ""Clinch Mountain Gospel"", this CD is still needed in any collection of Bluegrass Gospel recordings.Particulary good are ""Come on Little Children"", ""Take your shoes of Moses"" and my personal favorite ""I am the man, Thomas""."
1,This book isn't abot Iran,"I expected that Gary Sick's ""All Fall Down"" was going to be an exciting account of the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis. Instead, it was a boring account of the Carter administration's reaction to the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis. Sick worked for Carter when the revolution helped turn the president's foreign policy program on its head. The hostage crisis more than any other event, contributed to Carter's defeat in 1980. Unfortunately, none of this makes for terribly interesting reading. The Iranian revolution is one of the most important events in World History of the last quarter century. But you would never know that from reading this book."
1,It arrived damaged,"It had a big ding in the side. I took it back and the second one arrived without the scoop, which is the major reason I bought the bucket. I already own one and love it. The one I ordered was a gift for christmas.Still trying to resolve the issue."
3,sharp edges,"this is a nice little set, and my daughter adores it. but the edges of the spoons were very sharp and required sanding before i let my daughter play with them. PLEASE check yours before giving it to your child to avoid them cutting their mouths."
4,Good pan...,"I got this to grill veggies and other smaller stuff that might fell through the grates on my gas grill.After the first couple of uses (and subsequently leaving the pan on the grill for a few days without cleaning it), I noticed some brown discoloration that looked like rust on the surface.I'm still not sure if it was rust or not, but I got the pan hot and sprayed it with olive oil and wiped it down with some paper towels. That got rid of the rust color and it hasn't come back.Now the pan is a nice dark brown color, and I just spray with oil and clean it with the brush before use. It stays on the grill or under the grill when not in use.Other than that, it works as a pan should. Stuff cooks when you put it on there, and it doesn't stick as long as you oil it at a higher temperature than you cook at."
4,A thoughtful and informative book. Very even-handed.,"Fair and balanced, this book looks at the impeachment process through an analytical eye."
4,It all makes sense now!,"I have just finished reading The Complete Idiot's Guide to theImpeachment of the President. I was anxious to know more and makesense of all of the media mess, but found the newspapers and the television reports so predjudice in their condemnations. I found this book in the bookstore, and felt it was just what I was looking for to help sort things out. The authors brought the evidence to light in a clear and concise manner without beating around the bush. Unfortunately, that sort of hard hitting, non-bias fact finding, isnt what a lot of people want to hear. I found the book well thought out and very straight forward. I also found it to be an easy read that finally made sense of all of the confusing media mess. I would recommend this book to any student of political science or the lay person wanting to know more. I give this book four stars! END"
1,piece of garbage,I could not get this scale to work no matter how hard I tried. I just got error message every time I tried to weigh myself. I got it to calibrate once and then never again.Even if I could get it to work I would not recommend it because you only have 5 seconds to get on it once you select the user number (it has memory for multiple users). I am partially disabled and 5 seconds is not enough time to get on the scale after I've bent over to select user and then stand up and step on it.
2,Sending it back,"The scale is relatively inexpensive and looks nice, which is the reason I bought it. However, its precision leaves a lot to be desired. I had the same issues with it that I have had with other, more expensive scales in the past. It does not give you the same reading every time.I stepped on it the first time and got a reading of 155.6. 5 minutes later, 153.2. 10 minutes after that, 154.6. Thats 3 different readings in a 15 minute time span.I will be sending it back and purchasing a different model of Tanita. If that doesn't work i may just give up on home scales.If you aren't concerned with a flucuation of a few pounds then I think this would be ok, but if you really want to track accurately, look elsewhere. This scale is not for you."
3,great game but...,I loved this game since i was little because it is colorful and joyful (even though is hard as heck)but im kind of mad that it isn't for the kindle fire hd
3,Full of bugs because of my OS.,"Can't play this game because of a pirate head glitch that keeps happening. But it is a great game.I installed all patches, ran on windows 95 mode yet it still dosen't work.This is my PC fault.Get it for a old PC."
1,Totally stupid....,"this movie was so obviously written, acted, and directed by B-O-Y-S...little stupid chum in mens clothing...the humor is so adolescent, there is no saving it...as is the menace (?), the violence, and the entire attitude of this stupid little movie....it is without ANY DOUBT the worst film I've ever rented from Amazon, and I sincerely hope all involved die of an overdose SOON...so I will never, ever be either tempted by their trashy work nor somehow subjected to watching it...THIS FILM SUCKS!!!! Don't rent it. For any reason..ever."
3,Not too hateful,"The movie is a basic trapped by zombie movie.The actors are good in the parts they play.Definitely low-low budget movie, it's worth at least one viewing."
3,Decent Flick,"Not a bad little movie. Plenty of blood and decent effects are all here. The lack of commentary or bonus leaves little for you to sink your teeth into or revisit. I would not call it comedy, there is an over-the-top grindhouse feel and very colorful characters with the ""F Bomb"" being the main word of choice in most conversations. Just a few shades shy of being ""Troma"". So yeah, if you are in the mood for something more serious than a Troma flick check it out. Certainly a worthy watch for a B movie and it is a decent film."
1,Are you kidding me?,"It says I have to write at least twenty words in order for my review to published on this site. Okay so I now have over twenty words and as far as for this movie...it was Horrible, Terrible, did I mention terrible, can I give ZERO or NO STARS? I want my $1.99 back with about one hundred more dollars for them putting me through this!!!"
2,Corcoran XC1585 - My first pair,"After a month and a half of wearing my Corcoran boots, I would like to change my initial 5 star review.I had heard so many good things about them and I was very excited to make this Corcoran purchase and really wanted to like these boots, but they have been very difficult.I bought the zipper boots for the convenience of wearing them, but they are uncomfortable! The snap on the right boot comes off and the zipper cuts into my skin. I have to frequently put the snap back on and adjust the zipper making it inconvenient. I did not mind this even, but recently the leather in the back of the boot has been wrinkling and it bites into the skin above my heal.This makes walking uncomfortable and I am very disappointed in these pair of shoes which I was hoping to be the epitome of comfort and durability. The bottom of my heal also hurts when walking long distances.I spent $145 on these boots and I am definitely not satisfied."
3,Like an Atom Bomb,"Mildly entertaining. An interesting loose knit mix of country, blues and gospel songs having to do with the atom bomb and the Cold war. Most of the songs are fun and entertaining but not memorable. One stand out and classic cut on this compilation is Old Man Atom by the Son's of the Pioneers."
4,Very cute!,"My daughter really enjoys her watch! So far, it has survived her constant opening and shutting to check the time! The sticker around the digital screen was not attached when we opened it, but it's fine with the help of a little glue! It's not really made for children with very small wrists. I cut off some of the strap to make it fit my daughter, but it's been great so far."
3,Fun Distraction,"Ok, the first movie is pretty bad, the swim team and Rika were pretty fun movies. All had pretty darn good effects other than the first which had some horrible CG. Are any of these ""must have"" films? NO, but Rika and the Swim Team offered your bang for the buck with plenty of gore, and sex to please. Stories are pretty silly and i just totally had to laugh when you notice they lay cloth on the floors where they are doing the special effects and blood.... LOL. So, if you want 2 decent B asian horror movies grab it. I can't really say anything good about Zombie Self-Defense Force as it was just tedious to watch, but had a few decent effects."
4,NICE,"If you're into cheesy japanese films this is right up your alley! Some pretty sexy scenes in Attack Girls. But they are all good, cheesy, japanese zombie fun!"
5,A Life Saver,I brought this item for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it and so do I. He is able to look out of the window without any distractions and it makes him feel grown-up. I loved it so well that I brought another one for my 2 year old grandson. (The one with the Cars Scene) Now they both monopolize the back seat of my car!.
4,Easier to install than some similar products,"As a grandparent, I have limited need for a child booster seat. Although safety is my major concern, I am also concerned that the seat should install (and uninstall) without the need for a degree in engineering. This seat fills the bill."
1,Designed to annoy,"Rarely have i bought a product that I was so unhappy with. This is the fourth car seat we have bought, so we have some experience, and while there were pluses and minuses to all of them, this one is just terrible. It wobbles around on the seat, and does not sit securely. But apparantly it is designed that way and people are comfortable with it... But the worst part is that because we have safety seat belts (a Honda CRV) that won't pull out unless they are fully threaded back in first, the design of this makes it impossible to use - you have to semi-permanently thread the strap through a loop, so it can never fully retract. And so you spend a LOT of time yanking, trying to tilt the seat toward where the strap rethreads, etc., so that you can pull it long enought to wrap around your child. Grr. So annoying. This one is definately going back!"
5,Valo 3 Fixture Plug in Pendant Light Kit,"I recently purchased the above noted item to hang above my dining room table. The reason for my purchase is because I live in an apartment and I am not able to do any hard wiring into the ceiling. The Valo plug in track lights were easy to set up, and look amazing. The dimmer is a great added feature and the price is awesome. There are lamps out there that cost triple what I paid.The light covers are plastic and at first seem a tad fragile, but once hung, look excellent. I recommend having 2 people hang the light set. Other than that I am completely satisfied. I get compliments on them all the time."
5,"Very helpful, though maybe not for absolute beginner.","This book is really helpful in the regard that it guides you to what tools/materials you need to get going with wax carving. Also, it is good in describing techniques to use for different carving projects. It gives you a general idea about how to go and complete wax-modelling projects and describes working with different qualities of wax and their characteristics. Only minor thing is that it does not EXACTLY describe projects step-by-step, which leaves a gap there for the absolute beginner, I think. A good initial step was the book 'Basic wax modelling' by Hiroshi Tsuyuki, which gives the beginner the essentials to be able to go further in a project.As a conclusion, I definitely would recommend this book, I think it is very useful for everyone that wants to get into wax-modelling!"
3,good for starting out,"i actually thought i would find ideas on how to carve wax, mabey find the weighys & how to know the final weight in silver with the wax u use, but no this is a basic , if you knew nothing book. Is it alright to sell library books. I was wondering if it was stolen ?"
1,Modeling in wax for jewelry and sculpture,"A bit disapointed by this book. I guess so many books now have great photos and are put together so well that an old fashioned style manual like this just doesn't inspire. I'm sure it's full of really useful stuff, but the format is so off putting that I can't be bothered to read it. A really good, modern book on wax carving with lots of interesting projects is long overdue.."
2,so so,Being a big esther williams fan this movie so so because she doesnt swim that much but I wanted it to complete my collection .the best scene is esther swimming in howard. Keels living room very cool
1,Texas Carnival,"My wife watched in on TV one night when I was out and she said she ""never laughed so hard."" Although reluctant to do so, I ordered it and my preconceptions were correct. It was awful. She agreed too. I wonder what she was smoking while I was out.The only funny piece was when Red Skelton played drunk which is usually the easiest thing for comedy player to do. He added some pretty good wrinkles to the art.Also, the ""substitute bassist"" for the Red Norvo Trio must be noted in the liner notes."
5,Love it!,"This book is excellent. Being a criminal justice major and self-proclaimed buff, I can say that reading this has given me insight and further interested me in behavioral analysis. Douglas has a way of keeping the reader interested without using big, hard to understand words. He grabs you from the beginning with his own personal history and humble start into the field. He is genius and I thoroughly enjoyed this read....couldn't put it down!"
5,Prima Donna Satin Seamless Bra,"Although the price of this bra may cause sticker shock the old saying you get what you pay for is true for this product.This bra takes all that you have and helps get it in place and provides a nice comfortable fit.I went to a lingerie store in Atlanta that specilizes in bra fitting and that is how I first heard of this brand. So not only do I recommend it, but it was also recommended by the the store I went to."
4,T-Shirt NASA Logo Large,"in French:Le T- Shirt au logo de la NASA me plait beaucoup mais dommage qu'il était disponible uniquement en taille (L) et pas en (M)Au premier lavage à la main, et l'eau claire froide, l'encolure et les bordures de manches en rouge déteignent sur le blanc ce qui est regrettable.in English:The T-Shirt in the logo of the NASA a lot pleases me but damage that it was available only in size L) and not in (M)In the first wash in the hand, and the cold clear water, the neckline and the borders of sleeves in red influence the white what is regrettable."
2,Faded after one wash,"Received order fast, which was nice. Disappointed when I washed this shirt on cold, delicate cycle and the logo faded after only one wash. I did, however, purchase the Michael Scott Dunder Mifflin Fun Run shirt, and it is perfect! Good quality fabric, bright, non-fading colors, so I will buy from Old Glory again, as their shirts are fun and people always ask 'Where did you get that cool shirt?'."
2,Not for dayllight use,The T dot looks like a good reticle for my style of shooting but it is unusable if the sun is out. Only 7 brightness settings are not enough for this sight. Back it goes.
2,ADCO SOLO- Not very bright,"The ADCO Solo Multi Reticle sight seems well built, mounts firmly on a Weaver or Picatinny rail but it is not bright enough in daylight. I can't even see why you would use the lowest 5 settings even at night. I have excellent eyesight and shoot iron sights with decent groups at 200 yards offhand (highpower). The ADCO SOLO is going back."
2,Mostly Just Large Pictures,"This book contains very little factual material and is mostly made of large black and white pictures. It is nothing but a big coffee table book. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against coffee table books at all, but most have significant content. Here, most of the disasters are described in one sentence captions at the bottom of a photo. There are some chapters, but these are very short and often merely enlarged captions themselves. If material of this kind is all one is looking for, then this is a great book. The rest of us are urged to go elsewhere and leave this book on the store shelves."
2,Still not good,Ya very dissappointed in the 3 books but if I had to say this was probably the better of the 3 but not by much. The art style is ok and it's the only saving point. Story just really isn't that good.
5,Excellent,"A wonderful, excellent account of an upstart, regional carrier in Post War America. Thoughtful writing, true to tale and well illustrated. An excellent resource for any North Central Airlines employee, family member, aviation enthusiast or historian!"
1,DOES NOT FIT T32 tackers,"In spite of the description, these staples DO NOT fit a T32 tacjer, as I found out the hard way. I should have gone by the writing on the box itself only & not read the Amazon description! Buyer beware!"
2,Caveat Emptor,1) The included weblogic software has expired . The downloadable replacement is for NT only. 2) The promised on-line supplement to the book contains a 3-line apology from the author. 3)Several patches are needed. Most of the examples in the book will not compile.
2,Extremely disappointing and Not any substance,"This book claims to cover the complex process of component based distributed computing with Enterprise JavaBeans.I started off with it,thinking that it would provide me with the substance I need to for beginning with my professional level applications using EJB.However,I was greatly disappointed as the book never provided me with any details of what goes into building enterprise level applications using EJB.All the stuff was too elementary and seemed to be a rehash of the EJB specifications.The examples are rare and it seems the author himself is confused about a few things.I would suggest to anybody serious about development with EJB,read the book by Ed Roman."
3,There are much better books in the Market,I bought this book bcos it was the official text for a course i was supposed to attend. But i am a bit dissapointed. Lack details when compared to O'Reilly's book. Its expensive than O'Reilly's but contains very less content . Doesnt talk about the new DD's ( XML based ) and the samples are trivial . If you are a seroius EJB developer look for O'Reilly's book or even Ed Romans Mastering EJB will be a good bet.
3,Good introduction to the spec,This book is not half bad. To a lot of Java-programmers the EJB specs will make a lot more sense after reading this. I wouldn't base all my EJB knowledge on this book alone though.
2,Dissappointing,"While much of the content was informative, this book was poorly organized, and left many key points out of the development process that made it very difficult to get the examples to function. There are also some errors in the code examples, like listing 3.7, on line 19, sets the remote interface to a class called ""HelloRemote"", while there is no other mention of a HelloRemote class in the chapter. This line should refer to the class ""Hello""."
2,Much to light for real development,"While this book provides an OK overview, it's not very useful for real development. I learned more about EJB reading a magazine article."
2,A Reader from New York,It's a good book at first glance. But it contains cubersome code Explanation and some wrong examples which waste time to make them run. My suggestion to beginners is getting another book.
2,Covers gray well but watch out for the chemicals!,"I used this product for years with no problems and then suddenly developed some serious reactions including itching, redness, and sores. After several tests, I determined it was the chemicals in the product that caused the reactions. If you use the product, watch out for allergic reactions."
5,HOW TO MAKE AN OLD MAN YOUNGER,"Having Medium brown hair and a gray mustache and beard is not cool! The product works great...I have to use it every 2 weeks. And the price with autoship can't be beat. Amazing side effect is that when I meet new people they usually guess that I'm in my 50's (really 75). If the question is ""TO DYE OR NOT TO DYE""...the answer is DO IT!"
1,Waste of time,Have you ever started reading a book or watched a movie just praying it would get better?Well this one never did. Couldn't finsih it. The writing was horrid and the pacing put me to sleep.
2,dream coat?,"The thing got loss, it came late, and the product donot work at all, my cooker spaniel its with scratchy skin and its not shine at all..."
4,Works but pricey,I did notice a difference in my dogs coat while using this product. But since I bought the product few months ago the price has gone up $4. I decided to supplement the pups with fish oil instead and that seems to work just as well at a fraction of the cost.
5,halo dream coat,THIS IS WONDERFUL. WE HAVE 2 WESTIES THAT NEED IT FOR THEIR SKIN--A COMMOM TRAIT OF WESTIED IS DRY SKIN. NO MORE SCRATCHING ! IT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE.
5,Awesome,My Shih tzu mix licks the spoons and licks off the oil then eats.But the most is my beagle mix who was scratching uncontrollable. Now he's happier. He scratches but normal now. It helped him greatly
4,Works great...,"I have a 2 y/o rescued American Staffordshire Terrier (pitbull). She was covered with a mite infection when I got her, and after that was cleared up by the vet, a trainer recommended this product to help keep my dog's coat healthy. She gets compliments all the time about how healthy and shiny she looks! I pour a little on her food once a day, and one bottle lasts a quite a while."
5,awesome product,I was very impressed with how fast the item was shipped. Halo dream coat is a great supplement for dos.
2,Maybe good for health not for hair loss,"I bought this product mainly because I wanted my 3 year old labrador to stop loosing his hair, because he really looses a lot. It's not like he is sick or anything, it's just the normal on this kind of dogs. I read this oil could help diminish the hair loss, but I don't think it does that. So, I would recommend ask a veterinarian if this product is good for your pet and what is the purpose of taking it."
4,HALO!!!!,I bought a bottle of this based on the reviews and it has not let me down. Dogs coats seem very soft and they don't seem to be losing as much hair as they did before. The reason I did not give this 5 stars is the bottle design is not good and the oil drips down the bottle neck no matter what I do. The dogs love the taste!!
4,Great price & delivered quickly,I just started using this for my golden who has dry skin. She seems to be less dry & have a prettier coat
2,Great ingredients but pets hate the taste,"I read the wonderful reviews on this product and decided to order it for our two dogs and two cats. It seemed like the perfect solution to supplementing them all. Unfortunately, not a single one of them would touch their beloved food (wet or dry) when the supplement was put in or on it. They simply did not eat for two days. I tried again week later trying to hide it yet again with the exact same result. No matter how wonderful the ingredients, it is useless if you can't get it into your pet. I eventually found a great supplement from Drs Foster and Smith that my pets love. If you decide to purchase this product, please order the smallest container available and determine if your pet will even consume this product. I relied too heavily on the glowing reviews and ended up having to throw away all but a few ounces of this supplement."
4,Pretty Good,"Insightful. Not as flattering and complimentary as it could have been considering the relationship of the writer to the subject, which is good. Well written, a good read. well worth the money."
5,the definitive biography.,"I am truly astounded at some of the less than 5-star reviews... have these reviewers read any OTHER biographies of Lewis? This one is definitely the best by far for many reasons, not the least of which is the personal touch that comes from Sayers twenty-nine year friendship with Lewis. It's one thing to know via secondary research that ""with his meal Jack liked to drink a couple of glasses of red wine""... but Sayers clinked glasses with him! With Sayers, Lewis spoke frankly about his personal temptations, spiritual difficulties, creative processes, sundry preferences and worries.This biography can be read with novel-like enthusiasm by even peripheral Lewisites... and those of us already up to our necks will not mind holding our breath as this book rolls over us. Rather than use this forum to berate another popular Lewis biography whose author has the initials A.N.W., I'll just say that this one is a clear note that rings true."
2,Poor quality,"This is kind of a tired reproduction of a club performance. If you have ever been to a show in a club in Jamaica... imagine recording it with no production afterwards, raw, and reverberating. Fair performance. Would not buy again"
2,Sound Bites,The music is not really songs as much as it is a series of sound bites. The music starts and stops alot.
1,DEAD at five months,This drive seemed great for five months. So I haven't backed it up for a month or two. Now it is suddenly DEAD. It is still under warranty but I won't accept the free replacement because I just couldn't trust it.
3,Good Start...,"This book helps us to recognize that we need to devote much more time to the study of the Old Testament. The author does a decent job of answering 3 most important questions regarding the Old Testament:1. What are the keys to understanding the Old Testament?2. Is the God of the Old Testament also the God of the New Testament?3. How is the Christian to apply the Old Testament to his/her life?The author does a decent job in answering the three questions, although I was hoping for much more in depth responses.One quote I like, ""We cannot truly understand a biblical passage with just our head, but must involve our heart and our actions as well."""
3,"Good techniques, disappointing style","I ordered this book based on the reviews i read and the covering photo. I think the cover is the nicest cake in the book. The techniques are good and reasonably clear and for that I don't regret buying the book, having said that, I was disappointed at the style of the cakes presented. The cakes are impressive but not very elegant, crowded with flowers and colours. Mostly it seemed a little dated. I didn't feel that the cover was an indication of more to come, it is by far the nicest of them all. I wouldn't rush out and buy this book if you haven't had the chance to leaf through it already especially if you are watching your pennies."
5,a classic in american decorating,"this book is a classic in the world of cake decorating and it may look dated because it is 10 years old, but still there's no other like it!!"
3,Interesting,"This book gives a lot of information on how to do the cakes and the necessary tools needed, but some of the cakes were just, my daughter's view ""just awful!"""
3,Colette's Cakes,"Not exactly what I thought it would be, loads of information just not illustrated the way I would like it to be. Still a nice book could be more informative and better illustrated."
3,Not for a beginner,This is a great book but it is not for a beginner you have to have already mastered some real skills on cake sculpting and lots of fondant experience.
5,WEEDDING CAKES,"I'm very happy to find out, another book from this authorI have the little brown, well I'm from Mexico, but now I'm living in California and to have this oportunity and find this books, I want to buy all, but one by one. Thank you Margarita.this is my address.,Margarita Salinas1155 Paseo del ConquistadorCalexico, Ca. 92231."
1,Not for me.,The cakes made in this book are those that would be made once in a life time. Not for the everyday decorator looking for something different. These cakes are too different.
3,Winnie the Pooh and Friends Puzzle,The picture is a lot more fuzzy then it looks like on the computer. So the picture is not as clear as it might seem. It is a photo mosaic puzzle. Since it is 1000 pieces it takes a while to put together. Alot of times you have to sort the pieces by shape and color to do this puzzle. Overall i thought it was a really fun puzzle to do but it is not for the average person who want to finish a puzzle in a day or weekend.
2,Not very happy,"The unit shipped quickly, however while trying to install it I realized that the quality of the fog lamp was poor and the bulb that came with the unit was broken. Will not buy again."
4,The definitive guide to uniform polyhedra,"This book contains a detailed description of how to make (paper) models of each of the 75 uniform polyhedra, as well as some stellated polyhedra. Wenninger's descriptive and precise writing style is invaluable--his advice on construction methods and techniques are right on the mark. In nearly all cases, he provides sufficient data to allow the reader to draw his/her own templates, but especially in the most complex polyhedra the facial plane data is lacking, most likely because it is too lengthy to include. I would like to have seen more math in this text, and larger photographs. Otherwise, this is a must-have book for anyone interested in polyhedra."
3,Old approach,"This book takes an old approach on building polyhedra. Today, the challenge is to fold polyhedra, not to buid them with glue and scissors. Nonetheless, there are here good information about the solids themselves, and this makes this book a good resource to learn about geometrical proprieties of polyhedra. But old school."
5,discourse in the language classroom,I have really found it super. No problem and I would like to go on purchasing from you.
1,Norm Alsaline,"I found this book to be very poorly written. The book reads as if the author has overheard conversations (or lectures) and started writing about them in the third person, then switches to first person, making it sound like she has had all these experiences. If you are interested in forensic nursing please look for a more accurate source of information. Join the International Association of Forenic Nurses and get involved! Attend a conference and get the information from the lecturers. Talk to the PRACTICING Forensic Nurses and get the true stories as they really happened. This book is a farce."
2,Disjointed and poorly written,"As an individual who has an intense interest in both forensics and nursing, I was very excited when I stumbled across this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to discover the anecdotes pieced together so randomly that the book had no logical flow. I'm honestly shocked that this text made it to press with how poorly written it is; there was clearly no editor. Overall, I would recommend looking elsewhere for information. This book is a dud."
5,Great pedal steel for grown-ups,"Pedal steel music backed by a full orchestra is rare these days. Bobbe stepped outside, way outside of the country music mold when he wrote these tunes. It's a major accomplishment, and great listening in just about any environment. Highly recommended."
1,total rip-off,"This is an old movie ""by those that knew him best"" that is repackaged and sold as a differnt movie. The movie consists of several people, and his brother Leon, taking about what they remember. Nothing new, obviously just an attempt to make money from some old artists that briefly played with Hendrix as kids. A total rip-off"
3,"Man, what a difficult hero","This would have been a great story except for the fact that the H was absolutely awful to the heroine for the entire book. He simply never let up and believed the worst of her write up until the last few pages. To have it given it more stars I would have liked to have seen him ease up a bit sooner, by the time we got to the end it was really difficult for me to like him."
5,Take It! It's worth it!,I knew of this group from an Independent sampler. I happened In the record store and just bought it! I'm glad I did. Great album in the tradition of Brand New Heavies and Incognito. The is a great blend of Jazz junk and soul. Something greatly missing in mainstream.
2,Ethical 6-1/2 inch vinyl dog toy,"My dog loves squeakers and our her daily growl toy lasted for years, squeaker and all. This toy failed miserably. After 5 minutes of play, squeaker did not ever work again. Looks the same as the old newspaper toy but it is not."
1,Doesn't squeak,"Toy arrived promptly, but was extremely disappointed to find that it does not squeak at all. I tried to fix it, but couldn't."
3,Doesn't look exactly like picture,"This toy was exactly what I expected with one exception. The ink on the 'newspaper' is red and blue and green. Not only does this not make it look as much like a newspaper, but since I was buying a friend a replacement for the one my dog destroyed, It was a waste of money for me. I will need to search elsewhere."
3,I have been looking for this and finally found it!,"My Grandma died yesterday. I am planning her funeral and will celebrate her life with the things she loved most, her family and music. She loved all kinds of music. Her favorite song was Red River Valley. I didn't know where in the world to find this song in remembrance of Sophie. Thanks for making it available to me. I'm remembering how she sang me to sleep with this song. Now I can play it over and over and remember Grandma. THANK YOU!!!"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"Do not buy this DVD. It is an unauthorized biography that shows photographs of Kirk Franklin and interviews of people on the streets. They actually did re-enactments of ""supposed"" events in his life. A total waste of money. If I could give it a score of zero, I would."
2,Not What I Expected,This was not at the deep look at Kirk Franklin I thought it would be. I expected insite into the man who has changed lives through his music. I was looking for interviews with Kirk and those who know him. What I got instead was a recitation of already well known facts over snapshots taken from published articles and appearances. In addition the quality of film was not very good. It was certainly a disappointment and I wouldn't recommend to anyone. If you are looking for interviews and an up close look at the man and his music skip this.
4,More Stars Than There Are in the Heavens,"When the Lion Roars is a tribute to MGM, perhaps the best studio of old Hollywood. It boasted wonderful stars, great films, and a sense of family between its employees. This documentary examines the early life of the studio focusing on moguls like Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, stars like Greta Garbo, Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, Buster Keaton, John Gilbert, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, and Jean Harlow, and explaining the transition to sound and the preview process used to perfect films.There are interviews with many major names in Hollywood including stars like Helen Hayes, Lew Ayres, Samuel Marx, Eleanor Boardman, King Vidor, Jackie Cooper, Maureen O'Sullivan, Freddie Bartholomew, and others.There is an extravagant opener for each installment of this series featuring detailed miniatures which transform into lifesized sets. Patrick Stewart in period costume narrates the film."
5,I WISH IT WOULD COME OUT ON DVD,This documentary is utterly breathtaking. A fine tribute to the rise and fall of Louis B. Mayer's epic film empire. Curiously little is said about Samuel Goldwyn who who was a major player in the studio and instrumental in it's early years. Another issue is the documentary gives little coverage to the bitter labor stuggles MGM had with leftist union agitators who often targeted the studio.
2,Yaiyo Yuden???,"For the past 5 years, I have used only Yaiyo Yuden for all DVD recording projects. In the past 5-years combined, I've had three faulty Yaiyo Yuden discs. In this particular batch of 100 DVD-Rs, I have used 50 and have had 15 faulty or unreadable discs. Are these authentic Yaiyo Yuden DVD-Rs?"
5,great price,price was about $10.00 cheaper than what I usually pay at other dealers.nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice.
5,special tool,"geat tool, very ez to use and pull cam shaft seal. it make my day a lot less stress out."
5,The best recordable DVDs I know about.,"Taiyo Yuden are the most trouble-free recordable disks I have ever used. When one of these disks doesn't record properly, I know it's time to replace the burner."
5,Never a problem,"I have never had issues with these discs. They write, they read, the do what DVD's should do. I have an old Lite-On that is picky about what it wants, but this has also been solid.Bought them through Amazon, could also buy from SMS direct."
1,Disapointing,I was really expecting a lot more from the writer of Kingdom Come. The writing and art were both way to cartoonish for me.
3,Not what I thought...but still a cool book,"I bought this book thinking that this was a complete recap of the FF4 series, from the start. After reading the first few pages, although it is mentioned how the four become the FF4, the book takes on another route. The drawings are great, and the story line fairly interesting. I am halfway through the book, and feel that the only reason I am continuing to read on is that I am a FF4 fan.If you're expecting this book to give you a complete series recap from the start, it's not it. I bought it in a store in a mall, and the employees of the store could not tell me what the book was about, it was shrink wrapped. I took a chance and am disapointed."
5,Another 5 Star Rating,"This is a really good book and while there are no earth shattering or new money saving tips being presented, it's a conversational style of book written by the two authors. The content is well presented and organized. I usually get these kinds of books from the library but this one was not available so I purchased through amazon at a decent price and is worth the money. When I am done I will probably take a tax credit to donate the book (see, I learned something from the book). I give four thumbs up to this book... two thumbs to each of the authors. The book is worth the price and a very easy and entertaining read. Don't delay in getting the cheaper editions before someone else does."
1,Cheap or tacky?,"I was looknig for tips on saving money and found mostly common sense items and a few downright tacky suggestions. You can be frugal without being tacky. While some of the ideas are great for people with a lot of time on their hands, time is money also and if it takes you all day to make homemade fruit snacks, what are you really saving?"
3,"Useful, but lacking.","I found this book quite useful and helpful in certain respects, but in some areas, I would question the practicality and truthfulness of the authors' claims. For instance, in the 'Beauty on a Budget' section, one of the tips is that no beauty products can prevent or reduce signs of ageing. While I understand that many beauty products on the market probably do not do all that they promimse, I do think that good moisterizers will go a long way in preventing ageing. The authors also say that it is not necessary to buy a separate moisterizer for face and body, but I have found that body moisterizers are often too rich for faces, and often cause breakouts and greasiness. I also expected to find help on issues that were not covered -- utility bills, for one, are a place where I would have welcomed tips on saving money.I found the sections on buying food and household cleaners to be very helpful.Be warned that if you're already pretty thrifty, this book probably won't change your life."
5,Cheap Talk with the Frugal Friends,Wow! I haven't read a book with this much useful information in ages!...I've been using their grocery shopping tips and have already shaved off $50 a week from my bill. Their tips on Pet Care and Save On Sports are real creative and I'm trying them out now. My favorite part was the unique recycling ideas they have. I never thought of using those free CDs I get in the mail to keep birds out of my garden! These ladies are great. I feel like I know them after reading just a couple chapters. Can't wait for Cheap Talk 2!
2,Cheap Talk With the Frugal Friends,"I am a big fan of the Tightwad Gazette and I would say about 90% of the tips in this book are in the Tightwad Gazette I, II, and III, which was published seven years ago. The only tips that are different is anything pertaining to Texas. I found this book boring and would recommend the Tightwad Gazette instead simply because there is more information and the graphics make it more interesting."
4,"Good information, new ideas","Cheap talk was full of good ideas that I had not heard or thought of before. I had been reading alot on frugality lately and was glad to finally get a book with some fresh, useful ideas. Borrow it from your local library today!(being frugal are we are)"
3,The Label Reads: For Menstrual Cramps,"...But people use it for a lot of other things as well. Colic in babies, cramps, toothache, and headache are just a few. If your a woman with horrific period cramps, it sure does help pacify some of the pain (or so my girlfriend tells me). Chonchi's Boo likes it."
3,North of Capricorn,"From the back:Caroline had been abandoned as a child, but when a house was left to her in her father's will, she went to north Queensland to claim her inheritance. She didn't even know she had a past, let alone a questionable one.But Kiall Stirling knew otherwise. In his eyes, Caroline had been tarred with the same brush as her mother, whose only crime, it seemed, was in loving a man..."
4,From the Back Cover,"Would the sordid past haunt her forever? Caroline had been abandoned as a child, but when a house was left to her in her father's will, she went north Queensland to claim her inheritance. She didn't even know she had a past, let alone a questionable one. But Kiall Stirling knew otherwise. In his eyes, Caroline had been tarred with the same brush as her mother, whose only crime, it seemed, was in loving a man."
2,Quality,"I purchased this book as a gift, but luckily I had it shipped to myself so I could gift wrap it. When I opened it I found that there was an error in the printing and many of the words at the beginning of the sentences were cut off, and all the text was moved far to one side of the page. It was probably just an error on the particular books that were made that day or whatever. I would have been very upset had the recipient received this book as a gift like this. At least I can return it and get a properly printed copy in its place... hopefully."
1,Wouldn't Turn Off,"Well, I bought this toy for my friend's, then, one year old daughter. I think she would have had fun with this toy, if the stupid thing would turn off. The little girl played with it for a minute, sat it down to play with other things she had just gotten for Christmas, and it still kept making noises. My friend and I turned the button to 'off' sat it back down and surprise! It still kept making noises. Had it not been for this MAJOR flaw, I would have rated the toy very well. But the point of an off button is so...oh, I don't know...the toy actually shuts off."
4,Fun in English & Spanish,"This is a great toy, a gift for 1 yr old birthday. Toddler loves it and parents have learned colors in Spanish. Perfect size for small hands, 2 volume controls, 3 options for fun sounds or colors, not too much flashing light. I'm sensitive to flashing lights, so was concerned at first, but the flashes are muted and not disturbing."
4,Neat,This is a wonderful toy. My daughter just turned one and loves music. I was concered from other reviews about the weight of these toys but she is a small girl and can handle them just fine. I think once she is walking she will love them even more as its something she can play with while she walks
5,Good Fun for Everyone!,"We've really enjoyed having these maracas. Our one year old son really seems to like them a lot and they have saved us from many a melt down at the doctor's office, when sitting still for nail clipping, in rush hour traffic and countless other situations! The funny thing is that both my husband and I have learned the words in Spanish too. I highly recommend these for anyone!"
2,Awsome,"I bought it for my 15 monthes old daughter. She looked happy with the toys then. But I think there is problem how to learn number and color. It's not clear! Eventually, the toy turned simple for my baby.,(I mean just shaking). That's why she was bored for a couple of week."
4,Rock and Roll,I think I love this toy more than my kids. Forget the kids . Get it for your self. The kids liked it too.
4,Good fun.,My niece likes the one that just shakes. The one that lights up apparently isn't as fun to her.
4,fun toy,This was definitely a fun toy with the maracas...it was more entertaining then educational. Unfortunately with all the sounds and music you really couldn't hear the programmed voice teaching.
4,What's up with only one singing maraca?,"My daughters both love to bang the maraca that sings on anything and everything. They love watching it change colors and get excited when it gets through the colors or up to ten. I love how it can be changed from English to Spanish. It's been beaten up countless times and still functions perfectly. I just have one complaint - what is the deal with the non-singing maraca? The kids don't pay a bit of attention to it. In fact, I couldn't even tell you where it is right now! If both of them sang, it would be a perfect toy in my book."
2,Kinda annoying,It is not for 1 yo for sure. The music is not the best and it gets annoying after a while.
1,threw it away!,"This toy was so annoying (the musical one) and borning (the one that does nothing) that i literally threw it away. Other reviewrs are right - NOT appropriate for a baby...and now that my son is 2, I'm sure he'd throw it and break something or hurt himself, so I just decided we were better off to get rid of it altogether."
1,Not Suitable for a Baby,"Leapfrog missed on this one. Please dont give it to a young child as the child can accidentally hurt his/her self. I realized the potential danger after I purchased the toy. It is made of very hard material, which when shaken can result in head injuries. My 8 months old daughter started shaking the toy and almost hit herself in the head. I have since packed it away until she is 1 1/2 to 2 years old. Leapfrog should never advertise this toy for babies at 6 months because of the potential danger."
2,Broke after a week,Our son loved this until it broke. The sound started not working at all after just a week of normal use. Maybe it was just a fluke and we got a bad unit.
2,counting maracas,I just received these today from Amazon & im very disappointed.For some reason these only count to 3 & it says on the box that they're supposed to count to 10. Has anyone else had this problem? I will be returning this product.
4,Great for 6 months up to toddler.,I brought this for my son when he was 7 months. He lost interest in these really quick. I thought he would love them since at lease one lights up. He is now 10 months and only plays with the one that shakes. I think he is too young to really appreciate the games on the other maraca.
4,"Two skills in one: Musical + ABCs, 123s","Length:: 1:24 MinsWe recently reviewed the Counting MaracasThe Counting Maracas is an educational toy straight out of the textbook. It's about learning in a fun way.We are a musical family and we originally bought this toy as we wanted to introduce our niece to the idea of rhythm or beats.The toy has a voice that speaks out numbers and colors, to the response of a tap or a shake -- and that is its real advantage. The accent of the voice recording was not heavy -- and we were quite happy with that.Now for a tip. The main purpose of the toy is likely to be served within a few weeks and post that we've been using it as a musical instrument to provide rumba-shaker beats as the little one sings along to her favourite songs.Overall, there maybe cheaper alternatives in the market, but we were quite satisfied with the Musical Maracas.LeapFrog Learn & Groove Counting Maracas"
2,Expected Leapfrog to know the colors of the rainbow,Now truth be told my daughter has loved this toy ever since she got it at 6 months or so and still plays with it occasionally even though she is almost 3 but I am really disappointed that Leapfrog left out indigo and called violet purple. I expect a toy company that specializes in educational toys to have used the correct names and not left a color out.
2,fun for a day but breaks too easily,I gifted these maracas to a 1 year old boy. The one that lights up was broken in a day. It still plays music but the light part is broken. The maracas are too heavy for him to pick up in one hand. He pushes to roll them along the floor. If he does pick one up with both hands he drops it soon after causing possible damage. Is there a warranty that replaces defective or damaged items for free? Can it be easily repaired or replaced? I would hope a toy would last longer than a day.
3,Never Shuts Up,"My one year old carries these around like caveman clubs and hits stuff with them. The one that actually makes music takes FOREVER to turn off on its own. I can only tolerate giving him that one once in a while. Neither of us are huge fans of them. However, it is neat how the colors actually change and it does count. But it's still annoying."
2,Leap Frog Learn & Groove Maracas,"My grandson likes this toy, but I think it would be better if both maracas made some type of noise or music. He plays with the one that does, but the other one just sits idle and offers no fun or activity."
2,Very Loud,This toy is very loud and not very interactive. We got this with the guitar and he has played with it almost every day since he got it more than a year ago. The maracas sit in the toy basket. They are so loud they used to scare him and he is not afraid of anything.
3,A Little Disappointed,"I had high hopes for these, but I am a little disappointed.Only 1 of the maracas lights up and talks, and the other 1 only 'shakes'.I expected more from LeapFrog."
3,at least it was cheap,"Got this as a xmas gift for infant family members. only ONE of the maracas actually lights up/sings/counts; does its thing. the other one is just a basic silent non electric toy. So there is little incentive for the babies to play with both at the sametime. in terms of the educational factor coming into play.for 15 bucks though - i guess you cant complain TOO much. Its not to loud, or noisy. the colors and speech are clear."
4,Great,"Very good, liked the colouring and the fact that you were being thought at the same time. My nephew will love it when he sees it. Language clear and understandable."
5,My baby girl loved it,my one year old niece loves it I'm not sure she's learning from it yet but I'm pretty sure she will its light and durable and has very bright and clear words
2,Not very entertaining.,"These maracas dont shake and you have to put a lot of effort just to get anything out of them. I definitely owuldnt purchase this item again. They are very boring, and nowhere close to similar to a maraca."
3,They are fun!,"My one year old loves these, she loves to dance so they were perfect for her. She ""sings"" into them also :-)The handles are big and gripping them become a challenge for her little hands, but she still manages"
3,9mo is not very interested,"We received this item as a baby shower present. My son is 9mo and still does not show much interest in them. I think they are very cute and will be very educational, hes just not interested yet. I think the manufacturer should change the recommended age."
4,One of his favorite toys! Just wish they both were interactive.,"This became one of his favorite toys around 7 months of age. He LOVES to play with it. I love that it has both Spanish and English. I also love that it isn't an annoying sound quality. He will beat the thing HARD on our tile floor and even drop it from his high chair and it still works. He always smiles whenever he encounters it.However, the second maraca doesn't have any interactive features. It isn't battery operated and only has sand or something that makes a traditional maraca sound. This one is always a disappointment to him. I understand that 2 different maracas playing music at the same time is a bad idea, but most little ones won't hold them both at the same time anyway. We've ended up just hiding the 2nd one so he's not disappointed when he finds it."
5,Cool and Educational!,"My husband is Hispanic and we want our son to be exposed to Spanish as well as English. These are cool maracas as they light up the color as the color is said. They count the numbers and there is another switch that makes cute little music. Great for the car if you can tune it out. The only thing is if your child tends to chew on stuff, the labels will eventually wear off, but we know what is what. One maraca does just rattles like a maraca without the electronic stuff, but we did know that ahead of time. We did buy this as a gift and the family and child it was purchased for enjoyed the toy too.Great Toy for the price. My husband says the Spanish is accurate with the way they pronounce things for our son's age. I believe we purchased it for him when he was 6 months old, and he still plays with it (at time of this he is nearly 2)."
4,learn & groove review,My daughter got this toy for christmas she loves it just wish both maracas lighted up but other then that Love it.
3,Fun musical toy for toddlers,"I bought this for my one year old son. I have always liked leapfrog products. My son enjoys these but I think he will play with them even more as he gets a little older. I love that it plays music, does numbers and colors. They seem very sturdy and have already taken some good hits. The only thing I have a problem with is the maraca with the sound switch does not have the beads in it that make the shaking sound. I find that very odd that both don't have that since that is what maracas are known for. My son gets a little upset when one shakes and the other doesn't. Also the one with the sound switch lights up on the top different colors and the other does not."
5,Great!1,My daughter got these for christmas and they are wonderful! Very fun seeing as she loves to shake everything. We are also a very musical family and she definitely got that gene :) She is 11 months old and they keep her entertained for a good period of time. I would absolutely buy these as a gift!
1,Do not buy: The product will not work in a few weeks,"The maracas were fun for the few weeks it worked. Suddenly, the sound stopped working even after a change in batteries and the volume was checked. Emailed LeapFrog support who said they could not do anything since this was a gift and I didn't have a receipt.In addition, these maracas are made of hard plastic which could hurt someone."
4,Good Maracas,"These are pretty nifty maracas, overall. I wish they'd made little popcorn balls or something that the little one could see rattling inside. It's also a little weird that one is a ""normal"" maraca that you can shake on your own, but the other one can't be rattled, but has colors and couting features that are initiated by being shaken. I guess I was simply looking for plain maracas, but these are still kind of neat."
5,Great toy to keep them busy!,"These are awesome. I do wish they both played music, etc. However, they are very durable. We have music fun dance sessions everyday! Awesome!"
3,Good but not great,"I think it was a good idea to try and stuff all of these learning concepts into a musical instrument but it didn't quite work for us. In the end, I wish I would have purchased a wooden set that has a better sound than the plastic. We didn't see much benefit from the other features."
5,Learning to play maracas and count in English and Spanish,"This cute set of Maracas offers a true musical experience as well as learning to count in English and Spanish, plus the fun of playing a real musical instrument. The Maracas are suitable for a wide age range from toddlers to teens and even adults could join in and learn to count in a new language or improve their sense of rhythm."
4,Beautiful lights!!!,My daughter loves these!!! She grabs them and shakes them and looks at the color and bobs her head!! It's adorable!! The colors are said as it lights up the colors so it is very educational I can also switch it to spanish!!!! I was a little disappointed that both dont light up but I guess that wouldn't be the best! ANYWAYS GET THIS!!! Very educational and perfect for any kid thats a fan of lights & music!
5,Cool toy,"My daughter loves this toy, she's only 2. My oldest who is 4 tries to steal it every chance she gets. It's fun, to some it's annoying but I don't think so. It's loud on it's highest setting but my kids like it on the medium level sound setting. The last one broke because of a speaker malfunction. My husband didn't have a speaker to replace it so we bought a new one. Considering the typical abuse normal kids give to toys, I think this one lasted probably the longest out of our other kid's toys! We replaced it and my kids are thrilled!This thing teaches:NumbersColors of the rainbowHas cool funny soundsTeaches some SpanishYes I'd recommend this product. Probably to anyone under 3."
4,The lady has a fabulous voice.,"This CD is wonderful. Every note Ms. Galloway hits is dead on. Her voice is full and clear. The musicians are excellent. I especially liked ""Lazy Afternoon"". It was a good selection of easy listening music in every way. No sound effects or gimmicks needed."
5,Excellent Choise to iluminated,"This it's another product whit excelent conditions, great finished, good looking, easy to install and economic option for a goor ilumination in to the room."
5,love love love,This smells so good! It is very soft and subtle but for me it is perfect for a daytime perfume. It is also the perfect size to pop in your purse and take with you for a touch up if you need it. A little bit seems to go a long way.
5,Wonderful!,"It may come in a small package, but the fragrance is huge. Takes only a small amount (on wrists, behind ears and behind knees) and it lasts all day, not overwhelming, just a nice subtle scent...PERFECT!"
3,Amber Butter solid perfume,"I gave this product 3 stars because it is so grainy. I expected it to be smooth like the other solid perfumes I've gotten, but it isn't. It does smell pretty good, but not as nice to use. I can't really recommend this to other people, because I probably won't re-purchase when I run out, unless the texture is improved."
3,Its nice but I think I got an old batch.,"The smell can be quite strong so moderation is key; however, though I enjoy the unique wooden container, I think the wood absorbed the moisture from the solid. When I got it, it was dry, bordering on a paste more than a waxy solid. The scent is a spot on likeness of Tabu perfume. If I order it again it'll have to be in a stone container."
4,"Spicy, teak-like blend","Not quite what I was expecting, however it blends very well with other sweet scents I own (as well as my own masculine chemistry) to give off an amazing aroma.Received compliments from two strangers while shopping with my family on the first day I wore it!Apply just enough to cover your fingertip to pulse points, and go! This thing will last FOREVER, even though it is small."
3,ok product,"I thought this would smell better. My co-workers call it a ""old man"" smell but my mother loved it and immediately ordered some for herself. The scent does stay on for hours and even after a bath."
5,excellent price and item,"This item is an exact replacement for ""5th"" shock on Older Ford explorers. Price is excellent, my local Ford dealer wanted $90.00 for this item. This is made by Monroe so great quality and realiabilty."
5,A must for PC builders.,"This is the most up-to-date and helpful of the DIY computer building guides. I like to read a book, and there are several good and fairly up to date ones out, but not only is this guide thorough and accurate,it is updated annually, and the author's website(same name as the DVD)is updated even more frequently. Choose the book that suits you, but certainly use this DVD as a graphic illustration of each step. Enough talk. Go and buy it!"
1,NOT for Asian faces,"I ordered this mask after reading the review that this was specially made for an Asian nose. I live in Cyprus so I had to make an extra arrangement to receive here. I just opened and tried it on...what a disappointment. There is a big gap between my nose and mask, there is no way it will fit to my nose, one second after pushing hard to my nose, it will pop up...Basically this is like other masks I had before, which don't fit to my face."
3,Could be better,I swim in the San Francisco bay and I've owned 3 of these. The last me 3-6 months. They give out where the lens fits into the rim. Leaks start there. Be super careful with the mask. If you push it onto your face make sure you don't press near the lenses or flex it. Once the leak starts you are screwed.I haven't found any product that does better.
3,"good, but dind't fit my nose","These goggles are made for flat noses, I think. I do not have a very large nose, but after 5 minutes, the part that goes over the nose was pushing hard into my bone and hurt. I tried to push it up, but then it would leak.Maybe it's impossible with a mask design (because other normal goggles never touch the nose, just the strap connects the eye pieces)."
1,Highly frustrating,"They are almost as comfortable as wearing regular sunglasses when out of the pool. Unfortunately, they keep about the same amount of water out of my eyes as swimming in my sunglasses would. I couldn't even get an entire lap before they filled up, and after constantly adjusting and readjusting them for a half hour swim, I was forced to give up entirely. My wife then gave them a try (who is about as far from me size and facial shape as one could possibly get) and they leaked on her too. They were extremely comfortable and the range of vision was fantastic, which is why I was so frustrated that I couldn't get them to work! If they didn't leak, I would gladly pay double."
5,My new goggles,They fit; they are easy to put on; the curved lenses make for good vision--and they don't leak! Am much pleased with the purchase.
2,Lower Quality,"It looks cool and I like this product. However, after inspecting the edge inside, it is rough. Even though it doesn't bother me, I definitely don't recommend it to my friends."
3,"Good mas, but leaves a mark","This swim mask is works really well. The only problem i had with it was getting a little red mark right in the center of my head, right between my eyebrows from the pressure of my mask, perhaps because it was too tight. So i tried loosening it. The mark went away and the water started to come in. But maybe i am the only one who experienced this problem"
2,mask fit,"Reading the positive reviews, i thought this would be a no brainer. Unforunately i was wrong. The mask material is properly made, but the fit was not snug at all. Everytime underwater there would be a leak and water would easily get through into the mask. I've had to adjust the goggles mostly everytime i complete a leg in the pool. I've had to go back to my original swimming goggles to having an uninteruppted swim. FYI - i am an adult, asian male and maybe this just didnt properly on my face. Maybe having a flat nose affected the placement. I believe if there had been any mention of face structure, it would have been a huge factor on deciding to purchase these swim goggles. Now I know and hopefully this helps someone else."
2,Water gets in,Water gets in easily and it is hard to breathe while swimming. I am sure there are better products available.
4,Aqua Sphere Seal 180,"I swim laps daily. The seal was very good when I tried these goggles for the first time today. However, since these goggles have such a big lens, there is a lot of water which drains off the lens into your mouth at the very second you want to take a deep breath. After a few laps, I tried waiting a second or two before I took a breath, so as to avoid the water rush. It worked okay and since the goggles are somewhat comfortable, and didn't leak, I decided that this was a fair compromise. I'll get used to it."
2,LEAKS LIKE A SPY!,This mask looks great but after going into the water for the first time it leaked from the bottom. Not really a good mask for fast swimming but if your going to swim slow and face down in the water you should be OK. Other than that I think it way over priced for leaks!!
5,Mlost Comfortable Swimming Mask,"I've been swimming for over five years on a daily basis in the San Marcos River in Texas against the current or in a indoor pool when the weather or river conditions are now suitable to swim. I have been using the aquasphere mask for at least 3 years. I believe it to be the best mask for non competitive swimming. Some swimmers may feel it's too big and will cause too much drag when swimming competively. The comfort is like no other mask out there. The seal is superb to most masks on the market. When you are swimming against a strong current, you realize how well they work and the field of vision for swimming, snorkling, or shallow sucba diving is very nice. I recommend these for daily swimming and recreation. Once you try them you will probably stay with them.Kevin"
5,The best goggles,We discovered these goggles by accident in a store last summer and have loved them ever since. My 7 year old son really likes the comfort and seal. I myself wear them as an adult because I can really see (!!) under water and they are comfortable to wear...They are lighyears ahead from the small eye goggles people usually wear. They are great in the sea or in a pool. They come in cool colors so every member of family can easily spot their own. The strap is also easy to adjust.
4,comfort and visibility,"I am an Ironman level Triathlete and have purchased several of these masks. I like the tint and I like the feel of the mask. I don't know if they have recently changed the formulation but my last pair doesn't seal around my face very well and leaks, and a friend of mine can't use his at all due to leakage. I suggest you get the mask, test it for fit by putting it on your face adn breathing in through your nose. If it seals to your face keep it, otherwise return it. I still love the product and will continue to use them."
1,Better try it on first,Lot's of people love it. I swim a lot (everyday) and am always looking for more comfortable eye protection. I borrowed one to swim with and it was horrible -- lots of leak and a lot of painful pressure on my forehead.
5,Casual swimmer's review,"I formerly used high-performance goggles and found them to be more than I needed. They weren't designed for long, slow swims but more appropriate for sprinters and short races. These Aqua Sphere goggles are high quality and comfortable for anyone swimming in longer training regimens or races"
4,Be aware of the small-ish size.,"I included my own image for this product, to make aware of the fact that they are somewhat small, and will definitely leave a strong imprint around your face. (I am female and my face is an average of about 7"" wide from temple to temple. They are not necessarily uncomfortable, but they do leave red marks on my face).Other than that, they are excellent because (assuming they fit your face and do not leak) they are excellent at keeping water out, and they have an awesome field of vision. I use them in recreational ocean swimming/freediving and snorkeling, so clarity/wide views and anti-fog is what I value."
1,Leak after 3 months,"Purchased on January 20, 2012. Started leaking at seam by nose today June 5, 2012. I swim for 1 hour two times per week."
2,too small,"I bought a pair of these years ago and they worked great. When these arrived, they were super small and should be labeled kids size. I'm not sure who they think will fit these ""adult"" sized goggles. Was going to return them but my dog chewed them up."
4,An excellent theoretical application of Fibonacci.,"Fibonacci is a standard trading tool for professional traders, and Robert Fischer details how to apply it to chart movements. What I found most informative was the explanation for using it in time, horizontally, as well as vertically. Unfortunately, this book is not for the beginner trader, and there are not any exact directions on how to trade."
4,Interesting contribution to Wave literature,"While there is plethora of books giving practical applications of Elliott Wave Principle (Perry Kaufman's TRADING SYSTEMS AND METHODS and Constance Brown's TECHNICAL ANALYSIS FOR THE TRADING PROFESSIONAL come immediately to mind as two of the best I've seen), Fischer's book is one you may want to read after Kaufman or Brown. The last chapter, ""The Logarithmic Spiral,"" is unique and stimulating, and admittedly in the early stages of research (as of 1993). Since I have not seen anything about it published anywhere else, including the web, I conclude that it must not have fulfilled its original promise. Even if that's the case, it's like Thomas Edison said after so many failed experiments: ""I know a lot of things that DON'T work.""But overall Fischer's work here is worthwhile reading, if only to get a different perspective on Elliott Wave Principle. Jog your mind."
3,Good information book,"This book is a good starting to the fibonacci world, but just that. it is very interesting field and could have a lot of aplications but when the author comes to logarithmic spiral you can demostrate that it works backward but forward you would have so many choices that you will never find the right one. the book has poor graphics but it's worth to read it"
2,After the fact curve fitting,"Virtually every example in the book was after-the-fact; by that I mean Fischer could search history to make it fit to whatever point he was trying to make. With this rationale one could use a French curve and ""uncover"" hidden relationships on price charts. This was even more apparent in the final chapter where he tries to sell the Spiral Curve. He says outright that you might have to try different starting points, or rotate the spirals both clockwise and/or counterclockwise before they fit the data on the chart. In other words, if you move it around enough, sooner or later it will appear to fit nicely."
4,Fibonacci Book,The book was received in excellent condition as outlined.Would reccommend this seller.
1,SAP Business One: Conceptual Overview Only,"Had purchased the book anticipating that it included comprehensive case study examples (based on another review indicating that it included ""two concrete examples from the industry. This book provides not only theoretical, but also practical, instruction for the efficient use of SAP Business One."") Instead, found that while it has some good chapters (e.g. table listings & suggested implementation checklists) it primarily only compares screen shots with a master process flow-chart. So if you're typically like the ""learn by doing"" style of sample exercises provided in the Dummies or Step-By-Step style books, you may find this lacking since it only give conceptual overviews."
3,"Good, but a little disappointing","This is the only DVD in this series (an excellent series, in my opinion) that has disappointed me.It is entitled ""German Support Aircraft And Gliders"", but it seems to focus on the JU-52 and Gigant with a little coverage of gliders. I was hoping they would cover army cooperation and reconnaissance aircraft also such as the Fieseler Storch, the Focke Wulf 189 ""Owl"" and perhaps the long-range FW-200 ""Condor"" for example.What the DVD covered, it covered well and if your interest lies primarily in the two aircraft mentioned, this DVD is for you. I understand that there is undoubtedly more archival footage for the Ju-52 and the Gigant available, so to a degree it is understandable.Good DVD, but I was expecting a little more."
2,Not what I had expected,"Thought I was ordering the CD from the soundtrack of the original motion picture (1967)......considering under the title DOCTOR DOLITTLE were listed Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newly, Rex Harrison and Samatha Eggar. Songs 1 through 5 were from the show, however, sung to by vocalists totally unfamiliar to me. Songs 6 through 10 were a variety of young children's nursery rhyme songs and quite juvenile at that!Every song from DOCTOR DOLITTLE is absolutely wonderful and unique in itself and expresses so much feeling and emotion when sung by it's original cast members and this is really what I prefer exposing the young children to whom I work with each and every day.Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to vent my dissapointment in this CD under your customer reviews."
2,A New Release of an Old LP,"Despite the 2007 release date on this MP3 collection, this is by no means a new work -- as a child in the late 1960s I owned this ""album"" in the form of a vinyl LP. That should give you a good idea what it's like -- this is a generic third-party cover version of the music from a children's movie, intended to be sold in discount stores to harried parents who didn't want to spring for the full cost of the actual soundtrack album. It has a certain workmanlike quality to it, but that's about the best that can be said for it. And it doesn't even have the good graces to be only music from the movie -- instead it's padded out with a random assortment of animal-themed kids' songs.If you want something for a child who isn't terribly discriminating about the performance, this ""album"" will suit the bill. Otherwise, go for the actual soundtrack album."
3,IT IS O.K. THIS CD HAS SOME GREAT SONGS AND SOME BAD SONGS.,IT HAS A GREAT SONG AND THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE KIND OF BORING. IF YOU LIKE TWO OR THREE OF THE SONGS THEN YOU SHOULD BY THIS CD. DR.DOLITTLE IS A GOOD CD. I WOULD RATE IT A 7 OUT OF 10.
5,excellent,"I purchased Weird N.J as a christmas gift for my husband. The book came in excellent condidtion! The shipping was fast and efficient as well. My husband loves the book and I will be ordering more of the series in the future for him. If this seller provides those books I will definitly be purchasing them from here before I go anywhere else. great seller, great price, great book."
4,A must for any WNJ hitchiker,"What a better way to show off your weirdness than placing this book on your coffee table? For fans of the magazine, this is a compliation of the most popular stories out of the magazine, compiled with author's notes and great artwork.Although it doesn't have as much information as an issue of the magazine, the book has a wider span of topics, complete with articles and photos, as well as stories that weren't featured in the magazine.The price is great too, cheaper than most normal hardcovers. Plus there's an index, so if you're looking for something specific, it can be easily found (try doing that with the magazines).For those of you who haven't read the magazine, this book is all about what makes New Jersey weird: UFO's, ghosts, scary places, strange people, etc. The book mainly consists of reader's own experiences (also the basis for the magazine). So if you know a WNJ fan, or someone who just lives in New Jersey (or someone who wishes they did), this is a great gift."
4,This Book Will Go A Long Way Towards Explaining Me To Others...,"I received this as a gift from a close friend. As one who was born and mostly raised in Jersey, it really explains a lot about me and my family. The book was terrifically funny, and also gives some great insight into the experience of growing up ""Jersey"". After reading this, I think I have a greater appreciation for midwesterner's weird reaction to ME. A must have for those among us who still pine away for life in Jersey in the 50's and 60's and beyond. You can take the kid out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the kid, and this book brings it all home.A Midwest Transplant"
3,Cold Blooded is lukewarm,"While this novel covers much the same ground as Beverly Barton's The Fifth Victim, the execution is much better. The characters are three-dimensional, and the plot is much more realistic. Unfortunately, the writing prevents this novel from being anything more than mediocre. When it doesn't rely on cliches, it is often clunky, especially in the dialogue (the killer actually says ""Tut, tut"" while lecturing to one victim). Descriptions lack clarity and focus, or are just off the mark: a whip *blisters* the skin, a person's ribs *split* when kicked. Ms Jackson also seems unclear as to exactly how a stun gun works, evidently believing you can zap someone just by pointing it at them. This is too bad, since the killer's motive is rather interesting and believable. Still, thumbs down for me."
3,"Fascinating killer, too many far-fetched coincidences","I enjoyed the elaborate mission the killer undertook. The novel MOs and torture techniques were grisly but gripping-- much like the murders in the movie Seven. However, the pace of the book is compromised when Jackson indulges herself in too many irrelevant paragraphs devoted to describing the setting, the characters' moods and musings, etc. It gets boring, and I had to put the book down several times. Jackson didn't keep me glued to the text. The book (approx. 450 pages) could have been a lot shorter. Finally, there are entirely too many pat coincidences relating to the characters. It undermines the credibility of the story.P.S. I am a New Orleans native, and she did not at all capture the essence of the city. It is really incidental that the murders take place in New Orleans."
2,So-so thriller,"Having been to New Orleans more times than I can count, this suspense thriller lacked the wonderful, funky local flavor New Orleans is known for. Serial killers are always a hook and the plot line was interesting. However, the identity of the killer was no real surprise and somewhat of a disappointment. Cliffhanger ending? Nah, by then who cared?"
4,Bone Chillingly Good,"This is the second in the Bentz-Montoya detective series in New Orleans. While I am not a fan of the city itself, Lisa Jackson actually makes me want to live there through her writing. After learning about what makes Rick Bentz tick in ""Hot Blooded"" this delves into his personal live a little further and I went along for the fun ride. Meeting the beautiful Olivia is only one of Rick's problems. He can not decide if her ""gift"" is the real thing since as a detective if he can't see or touch it, it just doesn't exist. When there is a serial killer to be found, you better hope that you have got ace detectives like Bentz and Montoya to save the day. With these two no murderer stands a chance."
2,Entertaining book but has major problems....,"The main plot of the book is much the same as the previous title that used Rick Bentz as a secondary character, (Hot Blooded), but that wasn't what I find disturbing about it. My main concern was the fact the author seems to have very little knowledge or done very little research on exactly what the practice of voodoo and reading tarot cards are. She uses the terms interchangably. This is just plain wrong, by any stretch of the imagination. You don't have to practice voodoo to read tarot cards. One really has nothing to do with the other. She then has most of the characters so ignorant of what ESP and psychic visions are that she has them all assuming that that too is an offshoot of voodoo. If you are going to have some characters not know the difference, fine, but at least have one intelligent person to explain exactly what it all means and what it all is about, or you are just propetuating ""Hollywood"" myth, that has very little basis in fact."
1,"Man to woman,""I will marry you...you promise to sail world""","Written by the 28 year old physician/wife, this book is a repeat of the book ""Come About"". The only difference being no children here and 20 years younger. The focus is primarily on the insecurities, doubts, and perpetual fears of the author as they circumnavigate. It really pervades the circumnavigation and new places at some point. It becomes a task to read further. Danger and adventure are non existent. Makes for a good cover story on book jacket."
5,All Captains should read this book,"This is the only book that addresses the mental health of of one's mate, in a live aboard sailing vessel. Captains should be aware of it's crews moral and mental health risks, preparing completely for any extended travel."
1,"Read the book ""Bumfuzzle"" if you really want to sail around the world.","This book is about feelings and emotions.Read the book ""Bumfuzzle"" if you really want to sail around the world and enjoy the experience.You'll want to cast off tomorrow."
1,Not Worth The Read,"I was anxious to read this book initially because it is one of the few (if not the only) books out there that follow the voyages of a catamaran around the world (as opposed to a monohull). Even though the title entices 'Around the World On A Catamaran"" - the book itslef does not offer any information on the vessel and how voyaging on a cat differs from traditional monohulls. Aside from that disappointment, I had to wade through the drivel and whining of the author's fears and her bad marriage. I found her insights on the voyage not only poorly written and uninteresting - but sadly - it also encourges the negative stereotype of women as reluctant and inferior partners in the sailing dream. Untrue. I really feel this book offers nothing new to those seeking insights on traveling under sail around the world. And it reads more like a bad marriage consuling transcript in exotic locales. Skip it!"
2,Sailing Promise: Around the world on a catamaran,"This book was a major disappointment, after reading the reviews and excerpts I waited anxiously for it to arrive (as we - my husband and I are looking into doing a similar adventure on a similar boat). I wanted to know how she as a woman handled her fears. Unfortunately she never did, infact it is page after page of whining. Pity her husband, who had to deal with both storms and a crying, sobbing hysterical wife at the same time! This book is a waste of time, money and paper.Now the book - Voyage of the Northern Magic was wonderful, the author of this book was a real trooper, brave smart and insightful. Forget Sailing Promise if you want an uplifting, inspirational book. It left me shaking my head and reaching for asprin."
1,"""CROSSOVER REGGAE""","THE RHYTHMS OF THIS ALBUM DOES NOT HAVE THE UNIQUE SOUND OF REGGAE. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE ARTISTS CANNOT DECIDE IF THE ARE DOING RAP OR REGGAE. RAP MUSIC IS SIMILAR TO DANCEHALL REGGAE, SO THERE IS NO NEED FOR THIS CROSSOVER REGGAE. THE REGGAE ARTISTS OF TODAY MUST DECIDE IF THEY ARE DOING REGGAE OR RAP. THIS IS NOT ANYTHING AGAINST RAP BECAUSE I LOVE RAP MUSIC."
2,Works great until you drop it,"I am on my second wall file and it has broken again. The file itself is very sturdy, works great and holds everything I need on the refrigerator. The problem is with the 2 fragile little prongs that attach the magnet to the plastic file. It is actually fairly easy to have the magnet become ""unattached"" to the surface and when the unit falls one of those prongs is guaranteed to break and you can no longer use the file. I was able to glue one of them back and it worked for awhile, then it fell again when I was taking something out of it. I wish the prongs for the magnet were as unbreakable as the file holder."
2,"The File is unbreakable, the mounting though...Not so much","Bought several of these unbreakable magnetic files for our department. I was pleased with the durability and the lifetime warranty* (*= Lifetime warranty applies to wall file only) THE TINY BRACKETS ON THE MAGNETIC PART HOWEVER ARE NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL, THEY SHATTER IF THE FILE FALLS FROM THE SURFACE, rendering it unfixable.Havent found anywhere to replace the magnetic portion and am not about to drop another $10+ per unit to replace it when the wall file is fine.The wall file itself is great, roomy with a wide mouth and durable. Perhaps Rubbermaid should reevaluate its mounting system."
1,"great songs, recording quality makes my speakers cry in pain","The songs are very good, but the recording is so poor, my brand new speakers sound ripped when I play the cd. The band's first cd is magic, too bad they didn't record at the same studio and get a quality product for this release."
2,it's not that good,"well i never had a problem with any other sunscreen i ever had, this one is not that easy to spread over another product as a moisturizer, this instead to blend easily created blotches and when i was trying to rub the blotches off, this product start to come out into small rolls from all over, it's just awfull because specially on the morning when my time is so limited to have to clean the mess that this product had leave behind. I used Clinique City Block SPF 40 for many years and lately La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF 50 without any problem at all, well to me it's a big hassle just to try to use this sunscreen over any other product on my skin and useless if doesn't blend as good as i need it to."
4,Nice Bag but zippers don't work well,"This bag is great for carry on - domestic and international but the zippers are really stiff and tough to open and close. If these worked well, I would give the bag a 5"
5,WoW,"This CD is awesome. It truly was a blessing to me. The songs are powerful, the singer is anointed, and this will be in heavy rotation in the car. Please be careful with #8 it may make you pull over the car for that one..."
5,Nicely done!,"It was hard enough trying to find this cd in the stores and I looked EVERYWHERE. But low and behold amazon did it again and had it. They estimated that it wouldn't be here until the begining of June but after 5 to 7 days there it was on my doorstep. Nicely packaged and no scratches, blemishes, or fingerprints on the back of the cd. I do notice that when i first put it in my cd player in my car it takes a couple of seconds to load and play but overall I was, has and have been very happy with my purchase...thank you!"
1,Looks better in photo,"I didn't like this bookmark. It was not well made, and it looked better in the photo."
1,Ummmmmm...............................yeah,"You know what? This single wasn't really worth it. It's a boring ""heard this all before"" dance song. The remixes are your stereotypical 7+ minutes of the same thing over and over. I thought it would be a cool song, but I was really disappointed."
4,Good buy,"Perfect present for my four-year-old daughter who just loves ballet. It provides a good mix of performances and while some of the dances are not necessarily the best you'll ever see, the overall package is a good one. Nice to be able to showcase a lot of different styles to a budding ballerina in one DVD."
1,ITEM DOES NOT FIT correctly 1998 LIKE IT SAYS,this item is about 2-3 inches to big for a 1998 cherokee sport .. me and my buddy used a 2x4 and some ghetto engineering and made it fit (save yourself the headache) ..1998 cherokee monroe max lift 901114
2,"Received black and silver units, retaining clips missing","Ordered 2 units. They shipped one with a black strut, and the other with silver strut. The silver one was made in Turkey, and was missing both retaining clips--it probably was a previously-returned unit. Next time I'll just go to the local auto parts store."
5,What to say?,"Just simply, these performances are among the best of anything, anytime, anywhere and by anyone. Eroica is for me the best version ever - powerful and gentle at once. The Ninth is also for me probably the best ever or at least one of the bests. Fifth and sixth are of the same rank, typical post-war Furtwangler, power and subtility and some kind of mystical vibes. War recordings are much more running, wilder. Brahms First is fantastic, however I prefer 1947 version from Lucerne. So this is maybe in one pack the greatest music one can ever buy (depending on his or her taste, of course)."
2,I question the Shampoo Ingredients for cats,"This looks wonderful and probably smells great, but I am hesitant to buy knowing Orange, pine and tea treat oil can be ok for dogs, but toxic to cats. I've heard that for years and read lots of info about that...........""Cloud Nine Herbal Shampoo is a revitalizing infusion of botanical oils and extracts - turning grooming into a pleasurable experienceIngredients: Saponified Oils of Coconut, Olive and Jojoba, Tea Tree Oil, Rosemary Oil, Sage Oil Cedarwood Oil, Peppermint Oil, Sweet Orange Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Pine Needle Oil, Aloe Vera, Rosemary Extract (as a preservative)"""
4,Seems to be working,"I purchased this item along with the Halo Herbal dip after one of my dogs had a severe reaction to Frontline Plus. Since I no longer can use the Frontline (or other products like it) I needed to find an alternate way to help prevent fleas. I bathe my dogs abour every other week with this shampoo and I use the herbal dip weekly. The shampoo smells nice, much like citronella, and it is very easy to rinse out of my dogs. The shampoo leaves them with beautiful, shiny, clean coats. One of my dogs picked up a few fleas on a recent vet visit. I bathed all three of my dogs with this shampoo and then used the herbal dip. Since then I have not seen anymore fleas. I'm hoping that this product will continue to help me to control fleas over the summer months. So far I am very pleased with this product and I intend to buy it again."
1,Doesn't work!,Was using this kind of shampoo few years back and the stuff was so different. Even the smell of it! This shampoo doesn't do the job for our dog at all. Gave him a bath and his coat was clean only for one or two days. The other shampoos last much longer.I am very dissapointed in this product because I used to like this brand before! Will never buy it again!!!
2,Cheap price but questionable quality,"This is definitely one of the most cheaply priced 15' USB cables on the market. Now that I've opened the plastic wrap, I now know that this is also the thinnest USB cable that I've ever seen. This makes me wonder about the quality and whether it's actually going to support reliable USB 2.0 speeds, especially in an environment with interference.I'm only giving this two stars because I think that the product page should have been honest and explicitly said something about the thinness of the cable. I certainly didn't lose much money, but I wouldn't buy this again, and I'll probably replace it with a thicker cable from a better known company. You get what you pay for."
5,Amazing!,Purchased these for work. Work in outpatient chemotherapy unit and these are perfect for those who need something to get a taste from their mouth but don't feel like eating. Just make sure they know the center is liquid/sour--which is the best part.
4,A VIRTUAL ABBA CARBON-COPY,"Upon listening to the first few notes of this excellent single, I couldn't help but notice the resemblance to ABBA's 1970's classic, FERNANDO. But that's no surprise since Steps has always basically sounded like an ABBA tribute band. I am not knocking Steps at all, mind you. I love this song. The vocals on AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE are great, and I have to say that this is my favorite of all of Steps' great songs. I just bought the ""Steptacular"" album tonight, and I keep listening to this one song over and over again. This is a fun, albeit schmaltzy, song - hopefully this single will be remembered by Steps fans as fondly as ABBA fans recall the Euro-Latin FERNANDO."
2,After The Love Has Gone,Absolutely one of the better tracks or should i say one of the only listenable tracks by them from their new album. It is no doubt an ok song that will not be your average no.1 song u can try it if you feel that you got 10.99 to spend if not just ignore it
3,"Good for practitioners, but not for statistician","This book describes formulas and list of applications, but it don't give more accurate statistical reasons. I get how to use the formulas, but i think i am more interested in how to get the formulas"
2,Disappointed,"This hose kinks easier than any similar priced hose I have ever owned.I was even careful to unroll it correctly when I first used it.But it wanted to twist and then kink.It is more difficult to handle (without it twisting and kinking), than other rubber hoses I have owned.It is better quality than the typical cheap vinyl hose, but disappointing compared to other rubber hoses."
5,Rare George!!!,What a rarity on cd I was lucky to get a copy a couple of years ago.The preacher got alot of airplay on a radio station I used to listen to if you can find one grab it. Highly Recommend!!!
5,Silent Night - Dana Cunningham,This CD was just what I was looking for to play in my office during the holidays. I had heard a selection on Pandora radio and was hoping the rest of it would be as good as the one song I heard. I was not disappointed. Thank you!
5,This one of 5ive's best singles,"'Don't Wanna Let You Go' is such a good single: Rundown:1. Don't Wanna Let You Go The main song of this CD everyone knows it's so cool don't they? 5/52. Battlestar Battlestar is a cool song that's on the UK album if you like this song you should buy this single 5/53. Interactive This is cool, it's the same thing as on the album. You can: look at snippets of the videos to 'If Ya Gettin Down' and 'Keep On Movin'', watch videos of the making on 'Everybody Get Up' and print out a special 5ive message. A awesome addition to the single 5/5You should buy this single, if you liked their last single!"
5,great little puppet,"This is a great little puppet I use in teaching to remind kids when its my turn to talk or sing and when its their turn. A visual makes all the difference. There are four holes in the back. 2 for the clam shell, 2 for the eyes. It seems well made. The kids love him. I've named Seymour Clams."
5,I Didn't Buy This For A Child,"Um, so yeah...calling this puppet a clam would have made more sense. It's hilarious. The picture makes it look larger than it actually is."
5,The 30-Day Low-Carb Diet Solution,"I would like to recommend the 30-day low-carb diet solution toanyone who has ever tried to lose weight without success. I'vetried every program know to man and woman-kind! with no success.Always losing and little weight and then gaining it all back,plus a few pounds more. I've also tried the other low-carb diets.Michael Eades makes it very plain, telling you exactly what to eat. I borrowed this book from a friend and I will buy my owncopy as soon as I can afford to. I've loss 12 pounds so far andfeel great to. I've told all of my co-workers and friend about this book and recommend highly."
5,The 30-Day Low Carb Diet Solution,"This is the first diet book I've read that gives me hope that I can finally shed weight and keep it off. All of the other diet books I've read are too complex. The Eades have now given me the basic information to help me lose weight, along with recipes and a schedule of 30 days in order to see results. I'm about halfway through and I've already lost weight. I feel great."
2,30 Day Low Carb Diet solution,The Diet in this book was good but difficult to follow. I finally counln't continue with it.
3,A small version of protein power....Protein Power is better!,"I was able to preview this book, and it's a smaller version of the first book protein power. What the Drs Eades did was make it more simple for the newbie dieter, but this book is of little use if you have the other books. The eades have made it more simple to calculate your protein needs, and the carbohydrate portions are the same as in protein power, but now instead of 5,10,15 gram serving suggestions, its small medium and large portions. This book would be nice for newbies, but if you have the original book its much better."
2,I prefer the Protein Power Lifeplan book.,"After reading the Protein Power Lifeplan and this Low Carb Diet Solution I thought this book was to simplistic. In following a diet I need specifics. The Low Carb Diet Solution didn't give me the number of grams of protein, just a label of S, M, L, X, XX. I felt as though I didn't know which substitutions I could or could not make because the day plans didn't include the grams of protein. Another major annoyance was the way the recipes were laid out. The day plans didn't give page numbers to the recipes in the back. There was no good chapter breaks for the recipes."
2,Poor for two reasons,"This book is very much oriented to the American reader. It is difficult for a poor Pommie like me to get to grips with the weird packaged foods that are normal in the US. As a result many of the recipes are not much good.The book suffers very badly indeed from being Kindle-ised. The tables are rendered atrociously and cross references in the text non-existent. There are 30 days of conscientouly planned eating, but its tedious to navigate to the particular recipes and I gave up. Much easier to turn the pages of a real book.You need to be American, and to buy the (paper) book."
3,Smaller than it looks.....,"I thought this was going to be a much larger toy, but it's more the size of a matchbox car. I bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew who likes helicopters. The size of the helicopter is a disappointment. Although it does seem durable, this is not the toy I thought I was ordering."
4,Intriguing,I love the type of game where you can explore new worlds. The best part of this game is the overall No holds barred being able to look all around you! It's awesome. And the music...the puzzles. It keeps you interested and I love it!
2,Aura: problems,"This game gave me trouble almost from the start. It asked for CD1 after full install then gave an error message, it wouldn't accept CD1. What error? I don't know. I installed the patch but that did no good. The game just wouldn't play. I tried the game on another new computer and the same problems arose.I was able to play up to where the dude asked for puzzle pieces then it all fell apart.If you buy this game I hope you have better luck than I. I am a fan of adventure games. I am not a fan of Aura."
2,should you have to purchase a book to make it work?,"Despite the rather weak character presentation, I really enjoyed the game's puzzles and the scenery of it until nothing I could do would advance it. I checked a hint site and two downright walkthroughs and found I had done everything I was supposed to, but could get no response from the character who had to continue speaking to me for the game to go any farther. When I asked the company, I was told I would need to purchase a $9.95 book that would maybe reveal something I, and all the hint sites, had overlooked."
5,worth it,nice game. plenty of challenge. nice graphics. not too frustrating. nice to play along with someone else to see how thought processes vary.
1,Aura Fate of the Ages,I am giving this game one star because I had the exact same problem that J. Tyson had. I think I would have like it if I had been able to play it beyond the first level. A note to J. Tyson: Would you please let me know if you find a solution to this problem.
2,Not what I thought,"Though I never actually got to play the whole game I was a little misled with the description. With ""point and click"" games I was under the impression that you pointed and clicked where you wanted to go. With this game you only click to advance somewhere. This game is ALSO 360 pan, and for those of you who can't play those games without getting sick or dizzy, I definately do not recommend this one."
2,Aura Fate of the Ages,"This is the first puzzle game I've purchased and it was HARD. If it wasn't for the cheats and shortcuts site I found I would have never gotten past the first puzzle. The graphics are great, but again not an easy puzzle. If your a novice at puzzle games like I am stay away from this one. Wish I had found an easier game to start with that would have stirred my interest if looking for more puzzle games. Think I'll stick with my strategy games such as Pharaoh."
5,solution,"try updating your graphics card driver. should help. i gave this 5 stars because it shouldn't be dragged down by 2 people who don't know what they're doing. keep your computers up to date and make sure it meets the minimum requirements for this game, otherwise it probably won't work"
3,A little stupid but pretty good over all.,"This game has a story but it's flakey and dumb. But the graphics are good and the puzzles are quite good, bordering on exellent!If you buy this game BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE PATCH OR YOU WILL HAVE TECH PROBLEMS!! Do a net search for ""Aura patch"" It should be no problem to find. Once it's patched you are good to go.Fun puzzles. Not the best game but worth the full price nonetheless!"
3,"Very good, with some minor room for improvement","Pros:-great graphics/animation/lighting-complex and difficult puzzles varying in difficulty and application (so as not to seem redundant).Cons:-Audio.... The synthesized ""orchestration"" and sound effects are, at best, fair. Sometimes, poor. Many sound effects sound far different than the objects you are interacting with should. The ""score"" is much less emersive than what I would expect for a game of this type. It doesn't set the mood as well as I would have liked and sometimes, its plain annoying.All in all however, its a real good game. Well worth the $20 I spent on it. The sound effects and score are minor contentions that the rest of the game more than makes up for. If you're a fan of the genre, you can't go wrong with it."
4,Excellent Overview of a Fascinating Time,"Victorian America is a breezy yet intelligent overview of American life, especially middle class life, from 1876-1915. At times it reads as almost a laundry list of innovations and changes, but that's not a bad approach. This time period in American history is fascinating but extremely complex. The author manages to explain why the changes in technology affected the social life of today's Americans without being boring. This book serves as a great introduction to a pivotal turning point."
3,A bit too overwhelming in details,"This book is an overview of pretty much everything, or so it seems, in the United States between 1876 and 1915. Subjects such as the newspapers we read, the shoes we wore, the parlor rooms in which we sat, all this and much, much more. So much is covered that nothing seems to be covered in enough detail to be enjoyed. This is exacerbated by the intent of the author to not just to provide a snapshot of Victorian America, but to show how things changed from the beginning of the period to the end. So we learn how clothes went from looking like this to looking like that and then we are rushed off to another subject. It is not a bad book, but after reading it I felt that I couldn't really recall much in the way of details. I would recommend this book only to those who are interested in gaining an overview of the period. It also might server as a good reference or refresher for someone who has an interest in the period and wishes to brush up on certain subjects."
2,A Lot Of Information Poorly Organized,"My title says it all. I don't know what I expected this book to be, but I do know I was disappointed in reading it. It was dull, uninspired, and it seemed that the author was just putting things down without regard to the pleasure (or lack of pleasure) of the reader. The book was largely devoid of attitude or any sort of what-it-all-means, which is the ""what"" we read books for. If you just want a bald recitation of a lot of facts, buy this book. If you are looking for meaning, insight, or entertainment - FORGET IT! My suggestion: Find the same data in another book."
2,It's tiny,"My 11 months old daughter has TY ""My Baby Bear"", she loves it so much so I decided to buy a spare one. It looked the same on the picture. When I got it I was so disappointed. It's a size of a palm. It's TINY. My daughter can not even cuddle with it :("
2,Really small,"I know that this is a beanie, but it is really small! Very soft and sweet but beware of the size. A child couldn't even really cuddle with it."
3,"Good info, very very bad editing","This book has some terrific info, but I'm finding it unreadable. It's filled with grammatical and English usage errors. (Examples: inflict vs afflict, affect vs effect.) It's hard for me to take the author and the book seriously. I wonder if she's as sloppy with her facts as she is with her writing. I'm not saying she is; I just wonder. Anyway, from what I was able to wade through, it seems like there's important information in this book. Unfortunately, the book did not get the professional editing job it and its readers deserve, and as a consequence it is exasperating to try to read."
3,Healthy but a little too dry,I like the crunchiness but found these to be too dry or lacking in some other flavor
5,This is an excellent price!,"I LOVE these, and I got totally addicted to them, but had to stop buying them because they were $7 a box at Whole Foods. So, 6 boxes for $18 is a steal! Very tasty, crispy, high in fiber and filling - time to renew my additiction!"
5,Great Snack,Best snack I've found in years. I keep these in my desk at work for a mid-afternoon appetite curb. Highly recommended by all my family and friends.
5,Great healthy cracker!,Great combination of seeds on this cracker resulting in excellent flavor. The bite-size is perfect for dipping in hummus. I also love the crunchiness of the cracker.
1,Disappointed Southern Fisherman,"The only color in this ""how-to book"" was on the front & back cover, and two pages of color photos of flies. I firmly believe that color is essential when creating a book about fly tying. This book was basic and bland."
2,Not that great,I was not impressed. It does not sound as good as I would have liked and it is a little hard to use.
4,averatec adaptor,The averatec 3200 adaptor works just fine to power my older computer even though the internal battery no longer charges up.
3,It's ok,it's ok but a little cheaper quality than I expected. I would recommend going a little higher price. It also arrived cracked.
3,Excellent,My twins use this product for their strings. The only draw back is the fact that if you drop it -- it breaks !
1,It's a good rosin but it came broken,"I really like this rosin for students but last time I ordered 5 of this from amazon but only one was ok, two of them were scratched and the other two were broken, they can't be used."
4,just like you buy,Just like ones at music store only cheaperJust like ones at music store only cheaperJust like ones at music store only cheaper
3,Super Sensitive Light Violin Rosin,"Cheap but good, I think that have a good quality for me and is smaller.Cheap but good, I think that have a good quality for me and is smaller."
1,Very bad rosin. Horrible.,"Why would you buy a block of rosin as opposed to a cake of rosin? With a cake of rosin, you are able to change the direction where you rub the rosin on the bow. On this rosin, your bow can only go one direction which causes the rosin to form a rut. You don't rosin your bow in a rut. If you own a student model violin, go for it. I personally think this is an embarrassment to rosins."
2,Why buy this when a block of professional rosin is only a few dollars more?,I am a music teacher and can tell you that rosin matters to your sound even as a beginner. Move up and pay $8-$12 for something that really makes a difference. It will last forever if you don't drop it.
4,A Tub of Fun and Creativity,"My girls are three and eight. They love creating colorful designs with their beads. There are so many beads that the tub provides several months of fun. The beads spark their imagination and exercise their small motor skills. Of course the down side with anything so small, is the fact that the beads are easily lost and hard to pick up."
3,"Almost gets there, but then misses","Pianist Chesky has interesting melodic and harmonic ideas. He's rounded up monster players. Somehow, it just doesn't ever fall together completely and satisfyingly. My problem was that the ideas, tone colors, tempos and rhythmic structures of all these pieces are just too similar. Gonzalez and Hidalgo play really pretty, really interesting medium tempo son tumbao all the way through, but why hire'em, and then limit them to what amounts to variations on a single groove? HOw about something in 6, or at least a rumba? How about some post-Dolphy/Maupin upper-register snarl from Mintzer, some muted bolero-tempo or shreiking bop-fusion work from Randy B?"
5,It's a great book for kids!,"My kids just love it, especially after our babysitter taught them the songs. The 5-year old one likes this book very much and always sings some songs from the book. The 2-year old one likes to hum along. I am sure in the future after they starts his music lessons and knows more about the notes. They will love it more."
1,not received,Service is too poor. How do I rate the product when I have not even received it. I have complained several times but no response. I just received the spiral booklet in package and the big book of nursery rhymes was missing
5,Vibrant and Colorful!,"From the colorful cover art to the lively mix of language (French, English, and Spanish), to the array of voices and instruments backing up Amparo's voice, this album demands your full attention. The Latin rythms blended with hints of reggae and Amparanoia's unique soulful style merge into a beautiful example of true World music. Its an almbum to dance to, and album to sing to, an album to listen to in the car, or while relaxing in your living room. Whatever language you speak, don't let yourself miss out on the powerful voice of Amparo Sanchez and the vibrancy of a truly international group that will make you feel as if you are traveling the world through their music.Highly recommended for Spanish students as lyrics are printed in the insert!"
4,Una mixtura muy interesante,"Es un muy buen disco. Tiene mucha frescura en su musica y en sus letras. Altas influencias musicales latinoamericanas. Un disco muy recomendable para los que siguen el camino de Mano Negra, Manu Chao, Mimi Maura, etc."
5,Knuckleduster,"Knuckleduster is the epitome of rock music in Chicago. They put on a powerful show and their album identifies his. You can't put them in a category, they are in one by themselves. It is a surprise they haven't been signed!"
3,only okay,"I would not recommend ""Band in the Pocket"". I purchased two from this series and they are just okay. There are better options available."
5,A Hit With Children,I am a second grade teacher who read this story to a group of second graders last fall. The students also had an opportunity to listen to the Louie Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald jazz rendention of the song. My students love the story and frequently read it along with the CD. I like the beautiful illustrations that accompany the story lyrics. The author did a wonderful job of combining vibrant illustrations with music lyrics to tell a wonderful story.
1,Mount ripped as soon as it was mounted,"This mount was used with an OEM (HD) Bilstein strut and it ripped and send my spring and strut flying. Good thing no one was in the way of the flying hardware or there could've been serious damage. Since I didn't have time to get a new mount I've got one new mount and one old mount of the front end of my Trailblazer. I don't know how to return/dispute crappy items through amazon, so I ended up eating the $26."
3,Over charged shipping,"Product was excellent, but the price of over $23 dollars to mail was crazy. My USPS person said the mailing fee was less than $10 dollars. The wristbands only cost $9.99."
4,Challenging,"I read this book, for a book club that I'm in -- it's not something I'd ever heard of before, or that I would have picked on my own.It was enjoyable, challenging, and frustrating at the same time. I'm not at all like Abbie, and didn't like the decisions she made, but it made for great discussion, great reading, and amazingly... it's true.Which is good, but sad at the same time."
2,Not as nice as expected,"This is a pretty ornament, but no nicer than the 2.99 ornaments in discount stores. Although Amazon listed the orginal price as being 38.00, the boxes had the original stickers on them priced at 14.00. I bought several based on the fact that I thought I would be getting really nice ornaments. These were made in China, and unlike the person who wrote the ad for them, I do not consider them ""heirloom"" quality. I would not have paid 4.99 for them had I seen them first, much less 14.00."
5,This book covers the tough topics!,"Complaints or concerns against the 802.11 family of networking standards can usually be broken down to quality of service (QoS), security and range of service and bandwidth. The authors of this great book tackle these subjects head on and show you how this is not the case and how they can be over come. In this book, each is highlighted independently (after a good overview of 802.11) and the information presented there is wonderful. They wrap everything up with some real life scenarios that are also worth a detailed read. If you are in the business of setting up WLANs in a corporate environment, then you will want this book to occupy a place on your reference shelf. But more importantly, if you are on the technical sales side of the house, this book could be a real life saver and deal closer for you. Highly recommended!"
5,It definitely earns its five stars,"I recently bought this book after I borrowed it from my local library. I tried to find it a second time, and it's always checked-out in all four branches of our library system. The call number is 004.678 OHR. Out of all the 802.11 books, this is one that is the most packed with the real information you need to install an 802.11 network - antenna theory, how to do site surveys, how networks connect together, how to do an as-built. The book also describes how to debunk and overcome the perceived barriers that keep people from using wireless - security, interference, regulatory issues... If I was to recommend one single book on 802.11 to anyone, this would be the one. It definitely earns its five stars."
5,Good book for Wi-Fi Salesmen,It's a good book for the Computer Salesman trying to understand Wi-Fi. The best part is that it shows how to overcome buying objections and shows how installing Wi-Fi in a home or small business can be just as safe as a wired installation at the same cost (or less). *****
5,This is THE book for the 802.11 implementer...,"This book does a fantastic job detailing how to design and deploy 802.11 networks. It covers everything from small networks in a home to large networks in schools, RF to networking. ...Applications from audio through video. This book is a must for a good 802.11 library or someone with networking knowledge interested in understanding wireless LAN."
5,Down home rhythms with an edge!,"Brigitte Demeyer's music is like a bowl of hot, spicey chili... good down home rhythms with an edge.If you are hungry for some new sounds... check out her new release. You'll love it."
4,A refreshingly broad-scope beer book,"Jamie MacKinnon writes well, and writes widely. This book is not just about beer in the Great Lakes area, it's about how beer touches your life when you get to know it. It's about how beer is made, how people grow to love it, how beer fits into the world, how beers differ, how the beer culture in North America has suffered this century but is triumphantly rising from its ashes. I can pick up this book, turn to any page, and thoroughly enjoy myself. Forget your interminable lists of 'beer ratings' that cover every bottle of crap that ever made it off a bottling line; MacKinnon evaluates beers in a depth that is fascinating and arresting. Sublime stuff."
5,Marc Bolan = GOD!,Born to Boogie DVD beautifully captures one of the most underrated bands ever (at least here in USA) in T Rex. Visually and sonically superb! It does T Rex justice by releasing this legendary film and concert footages. Steve Currie and Bill Legend have to be one of the best rhythm section in Rock history!Must have for any rock fan!
2,Bolan was a legend in his own mind,"Watching this film reminded me of how T-Rex swindled a bunch of screaming girls into believing he was the second coming of the Beatles. When in fact he was the inspiration for the Bay City Rollers and all the bad pop music that came after him. Interviews with producer Tony Visconti are so over the top it's pathetic. Visconti compares Bolan with Hendrix, the Beatles and has the audacity to say that he, Bowie and Thin Lizzy ""wrote the book on British rock"". Laughable.For fun keep your eye on Bolan's guitar playing. His basic technique is playing an A7 chord incessantly and bursting into random three note lead runs that are comical."
4,A Modest Mennonite Home is certainly a book worth the purchase,I found the book to be very informative and from my Mennonite friends who found it a joy to read as it brought back many memories for them
5,Beautiful music!,"This created beautiful music and the price on Amazon was better then the instore price! I didn't find the chimes to be overly loud or annoying, but very soft and pretty."
3,Understated chimes,"These chimes are attractive and well made. Their ""song"" is sweet and pleasant, but not for the hard of hearing. Even in a considerable breeze they barely make their presence known. I have relocated them twice, hoping that they would be more active. Now wishing I had gone with a somewhat larger set of chimes."
3,Knot broke,The Chimes are great but the green wind knot broke after 2 months and it seems a bit heavy too.
5,Wonderful Sound,"This has a very melodic sound that plays at the slightest breeze. There are times that you will hear a vibrating, humming sound that sets it apart from other chimes. The stone at the bottom is very pretty when it catches the light. Worth the money."
3,Steady and mellow,"One has to really appreciate Richie Hawtin (aka Plastikman) in order to appreciate the CD. He plays arduously long 8-hour sets that attract many fans all over the country. he combines slow, melodic basses together to produce a self-inducing type of transic style. this cd is not for one who is looking to dance...and often it is difficult to hear the sounds at all."
3,More Sci-fi based than romance,"This was a good sci-fi book. I really enjoyed it. However, if you are looking for more romance it was not the main point but more the later culmination of the book. Not what I was expecting but very good. Very creative weaving of science and feminist viewpoints. I recommend it."
4,This book had erotic sex scenes but it also had a complex science fiction story that was good.,"I enjoyed reading Jade Black's creative take on what the earth and its inhabitants might look like 1 million years AD. There were two societies: the Takuri and the Xandi who had been at war with each other for 20,000 years. The Takuri society consisted of strong women who ruled over weaker men. The Xandi were shape shifting gargoyle vampire types. The Xandi men ruled over women. Several scientists left earth in 2179 and are returning two years later their time but 1 million years later in earth time.DATA:Sexual language: erotic. Number of sex scenes: ten. Setting: 1 million years AD outer space and earth. Copyright: 2004. Genre: erotic science fiction paranormal romance.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Jaid Black books, see my 5 star review of ""One Dark Night"" posted 4/2/08."
4,Breeding Ground,Could not put it down!! Love Jaid Black and the way she writes. She has a way of connecting with her readers.
4,A gripping mystery,"""Where Evil Hides"" is an excellent homewtown mystery story. The mystery at the heart of the story was enthralling and kept me reading. The side stories between the various characters also added greatly to the plot. I felt like I understood the locals since Mr. Hovey gave a glimpse into their personal lives. Overall this is a great novel and if you like mysteries or a little small town intrigue I would recomend it."
3,Good but not great read.,"I bought the book not only because I love mystery, thriller and horror novels but because I happen to live in Pine County. I was a little disappointed with the name changes of some of the places visited in the book, like the Grant House being the Frank House instead and also question why he had to plop a fictional town (Pine Brook) into the county.Halfway through I was yelling at the main character for not seeing the obvious and not putting together the few real clues and eyewitness reports he had right in front of him. The brightest spot of the whole book is the friction between the county coroner and the undersherrif and I feel this part could have been expanded on more and had it conflict more with the solving of the case.While the author hits home with some of his characters and has great subplots the main mystery of the story is too contrived."
4,attention caught,"I'm one who rarely sits down to read a book. I don't enjoy reading,to hiper I think. Where Evil Hides caught my attention because it was written about Pine Co. which is the next county south of my home. Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down.I was able to visualize the towns, the country roads and many of the characters brought back memories of similar people in my life. I felt the book was well put together and I'm looking forward to his next book."
4,Great Work by New Author,"Where Evil Hides is a great work by a new author. The plot absorbs you quickly and makes the book hard to put down until it's finished. Nice pace for the plot, and it winds you down after the climax. It doesn't leave you hanging... only leaves you wishing there was a sequel to pick up right away.If you enjoy reading John Sandford, WEB Griffin, or William Caunitz, you'll really like this book!"
3,Consumate Evil in Rural Minnesota,"Pine County lies on the eastern edge of Minnesota roughtly midway between Duluth and the Twin Cities. It's a rural county of vast stretches of cut-over timber land, isolated homes, and small towns and hamlets. It's small police force consists of the County Sheriff and his uniformed and civilian staff. When a corrupted individual begins a reign of rape and murder, the Sheriff's force of deputies and its principal investigator is hard-pressed to contain the violence, protect vulnerable women, and find the perpetrator.In his debut novel, Dean Hovey demonstrates strong skills as a story-teller. He has a fine sense of pace and of the people in his novel. In addition, a couple of sub-plots are nicely linked to the primary story and are satifactorily resolved, as is the mystery itself.The book is attractively packaged by a relatively young Minnesota publisher. I look for more good things from this author and this publisher."
5,Crusader Knights,This is a good book from Osprey . I would always recommend OSPREY books for those who are trying to put a “look” together.
2,A poor excuse for a manga!!!,"Now, mabye if the artist/author of this manga could draw i would have given another star, but really they're hopeless. The story isn't that good either at first it is very confusing, but that did not get me down i kept reading but after the first one i did not want to read another planet ladder as long as i live. The story is extremely predicting and all the characters are stereotypes. If your looking for an interesting manga I would suggest chobits by clamp or Ceres by Yu Watase"
4,An Otherworldly Manga,"A brief plot summary: Kaguya, a daughter of a wealthy CEO'?' who was just arrested for stock fraud or something is transported to one of the world of parallels and a prophecy. She wakes up in her bedroom and looks and sees forests instead of urban/rural landscapes. She is travels alongside this prince dude, who despite being motionless seems to store deep knowledge, he's one of the characters that may be of importance to Kaguya's prophecy. I'm not going to give away to much. Excellent manga! Currently out-of-print, but at least they got finish the series. I've only read volume one and I am going to also buy volume two. A fantasy/science-fiction manga."
3,Interesting,The word 'interesting' was once placed off-limits by an academic friend of mine. He said that one had to commit and the word did not allow that. I wanted to be overwhelmed but when it didn't happen I was not disappointed. I am glad to own a copy.
4,A very fine album,"I bought this on the strength of the ""sidemen."" The album has some extremely strong and beautiful moments but a good portion of side 1 rambles a bit. The set opens with a beautiful section for Haden and Jarrett (on reeds), like many of the best moments on this set, it is Haden who shines. Haden, Dewey and Motion really dig in one side two, which is marred only by Jarrett's annoying habit of ""singing"" during his solos (keep to a minimum here). All in all, the some may not be as good as its parts but there are some terrific parts."
5,"Intense, yet accessible....","I don't know why, but I have listened to this recording more than any other jazz records I own. It is not only the way in which Jarrett and other musicians build up the musical tension and release it that pulls me in for repeated listening, but it is the passion they put into their playing, chorus after chorus. It may also be that I ""hear"" a whole spectrum of human feelings which I cannot accurately find words for. (like in Cecil Taylor's or Mingus's music). Jarrett's Bass Recorder and Haden's Acoustic Bass sets the hypnotic mood in the opening, and the music burns slowly from a flicker to a smouldering fire. Each musicians play with great sensitivity and depth, even in the ""free"" sections. And Jarrett's piano solos are to die for ! It is a pity that the CD version is hard to get. Go grab the vinyl (with its tasteful ECM sound)and reward yourself with a soundscape you will never forget."
3,excellent ring....but worst shipping,"excellent quality ring.....but worst quality shipping, my package was missing 2 of the 5 items i ordered and also arrived very late.I still havent recieved my missing items after several conplaints....nor recieved any refund....its more than 1 months they havent done any thing.so if u really like it then only buy...also be prepared to lose ur money."
4,Are Men getting a fair shake?,Great study on how males are mistreated in our culture and how/why they don't know what it takes to be a real man.
1,All about Eve or deja vous all over again,"Lots of examples given of now, but no comparisons given with then. Lionel apparently sees only the believed harm to men today while ignoring the horror women had to endure up to the middle of this Century.It is just one more example of blaming the woman as in the story of Eve and Adam. Only Lionel has her using a pill this time instead of an apple."
1,"Awful, just Awful","I could not stand this book, not only was it extremely inaccurate, it was poorly written. Males are not declining at all, what percentage of the house and senate are females? How many female CEO's do you know of large companies?"
4,Poverty And Age Reduce Women's Options,"Lionel Tiger's c1999 text ""The Decline Of Males"" is a socioeconomic study of late 20th Century gender roles. The slightly pedantic study is detailed, well referenced and addresses global trends while concentrating on Western society.Professor Tiger argues that men's aptitudes (hunter/maintainer/heavy lifter) are devalued in post-industrial society. This is true in affluent petroleum-energized society, but men's aptitudes regain value as economic conditions worsen and petroleum prices rise. And senior women (usually) lose physicial stamina earlier than senior men (e.g., osteoporosis). Senior women often need heavy lifters.Women choosing to live without a long-term male partner might require paid assistance during their senior years, a potentially costly lifestyle decision. And children raised without a male parent's guidance must learn some of life's lessons themselves."
5,First Light,"This book is an exceptionally well written account of the author's progression through RAF flight training and on to the Battle of Britain. If you are a pilot or are interested in aviation, you wont be able to put it down. Additionally, you may just learn some history if you're not careful. This is a book you will likely read more than once."
4,An excellent flying memoir,"I picked up this book on my departure from Gatwick about a year ago and only just got around to reading it. As I was reading I wondered why it took me so long as I found it hard to put down. The author's experiences during the Battle of Britain are gripping and put the reader right in the cockpit.His first hand accounts of battle in a Spitfire are first class.In addition to this book I also recommend the novel ""Piece of Cake"" by Derek Robinson for anyone interested in this period."
4,Thrilling WWII tale of a young pilot,"The story is exciting and well told, a real page turner and a must for World War II enthusiasts."
1,EXTREMLY POOR MANUFACTURED,"I CUT MARBLE, GRANITE AND LAND SCAPING BRICKS, I BOUGHT THESE BLADES QUITE CHEAP BUT BLADES WEAR OFF IN FEW CUTS, THE CUTTING PART JUST BREAK AWAY UN EVENLY,IN MY OPINION ITS NOT WORTH AT ALL DESPITE IT QUITE CHEAP, I HAVE LIMITED TIME TO WORK ON WEEKEND AND PROBLEM WITH BLADES TAKE ALL MY TIME IN CHANGING AND WASTFUL CUT, NOW I AM USING BOSCH, DEWALTE AND MK BLADES, EXPENSIVE BUT WORKS PERFECTLY."
5,Call me old fashioned but...,"I have never had a problem with the South. I like grits and ACC sports and the Clintons. So I wasn't exactly anticipating the attack on chivalry and tradition (read chauvinism and classism) that The New Southern Gentleman delivers, with a vengeance even Sherman would envy.The novel opens quietly on a young man, Dan Deal, as he confidently strides through a world completely under his command. But it quickly becomes clear just how much of that world is illusory, and we feel compelled to sympathize with Dan, the innocent dreamer, the gentleman among scoundrels. Then we discover that it has always been clear to Dan that his world is just a mirage, and things start to get really interesting.Mr. Booth's writing is pure and precise, with those sweet, indolent tongues of Dixie concealing the all-steel construction of his New-South sentences. The tone is impartial and the timing is perfect. He's quite the storyteller.The best first novel this side of Fitzgerald. Five Stars."
1,F word prevails!,"We bought the audio book because it seemed silly. No warning on the package. First story is f-word littered. Not a family product. Harper Audio, I have learned my lesson. I will not buy your products since I can't count on the label being truthful, and I will also research other audio books before I suject my family to such garbage."
4,Hope,"I am three-fourths through this book and have found it to be a great exploration of both my emotional and family history. Being a counselor, I have spent a great deal of time examining my family patterns, however, the author guided me through the process in a slightly different way, than the conventional Genogram. I found her twist on the basic Genogram to be very enlightening. It even lead to a conversation with my husband, that might not have happened otherwise. I am finding that no matter what infertility book I open, I am not finding ""the answer."" With this book, I found answers to questions I wasn't even asking."
1,"So bad it should be funny, but it's not.","I don't know how I came across this. I hope I didn't buy it. You would think it'd have potential... Sex, I like. Classical Music, I like. This, I don't like. The music is fine but the effects just sound too contrived. You end up hoping for a premature ejaculation just so you can listen to the music without the constant panting, slurping and zipping (or unzipping I guess). If you're into wacky samples, some of the ""vocals"" are pretty funny, but on whole you will be sadly disappointed if you are hoping for entertainment let alone arousal from this shlock."
2,There's no mystery here---,"If you've never read any of the Sneaky Pie books--don't buy this one! Start at the beginning (Wish You Were Here) as this was once a great series, and read the books in sequence until you begin to get bored--then STOP!! The series only gets worse.The wonderful warm characters have lost their charm, the ""mysteries"" have become flat and nonexistent, and the books have been weighted down with too much technical information.Ms. Brown also has begun using her books as a soapbox for her many opinions. While it is interesting to find out an author's views, she goes on and on...and on."
1,Sour Puss left a sour taste...,"Snore. I too have loved and read the others in this series. This one bored me to death. I agree with most of the negative comments here.I was happy that Harry and Fair got married again, but with theemotional tension between the two of them gone, something is missing. I missedMaranda, too, who only appeared briefly at the end. I loved her bible-quoting moments and the descriptions of her yummy baked goods.I think it was a mistake to have Harry leave the post office. Gone are the wonderfulcameo appearances from minor characters throughout the book. With the shocking knowedge that Mrs. Murphy has not been spayed, are we going to see little Murphies running about?Well, every good writer -- and Rita Mae Brown is indeed a good writer -- is entitled to one bad book now and then. Hope this is the last bad one in this series!"
1,Thank You Reviewers & RMB fans,"Your reviews below have really helped, KEEP THEM COMING! I, also, am a great fan of these books....what happens to these writers? I found the same problem with Patricia Cornwell.Thanks again for taking the time and giving THE FANS a heads-upon this latest book by our little Sneaky Pie."
2,agreed - this one is a big lecture,"I have to agree with many of the other reviews here at Amazon - if I wanted a lecture, I would go to one. I also yawned through most of the ""fact/opinion"" of the animals and think its quite stretching that cats and dogs have these kinds of conversations. I understand that some of it was necessary to make the point that these people are serious about wine making, but I thought Ms. Brown took it a little too far this time."
1,Sour Puss,"Rita Mae Brown's characters are always a treat, and I look forward to each new book. But unfortunately, this one, was a a sour treatment. Too much techie information about grape growing and wineries, and not enough info about the wonderful characters and the usual antics of Mrs. Murphy, Tucker, Pewter and the horses. I have all of Ms. Brown's other books, and have loved them and re-read them often. This one, which sounded really interesting from the advance reviews and jacket info, just fell flat. A real disappointment."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G!!!! PREDICTABLE,"I have been an avid reader of RMB tales for years. This one was the worst....boring and stale and very, very predictable. I cannot believe the rich characters of Crozet were betrayed by mundane descriptions of them in this book. The plot was lumpy and flipped back and forth between the mystery and the lessons on Virginia agriculture... no smooth transitions. I was so very disappointed by this book that I will wait for the next one to come out in paperback so I don't waste the dollars on another prune."
2,definitely not the best,"Count another one very disappointed with this book. I have always enjoyed this series and generally buy them as soon as they come out, but had I read this one before buying, I would have had second thoughts. The plot takes a long time to get going and it spends too much time sounding more like a scientific presentation rather than a mystery. There were also things that seemed to be pulled from midair - Harry, who was so devastated by her divorce, suddenly is found to have had an affair soon after her divorce that was never mentioned before? And Mrs. Murphy, who was supposedly spayed, really wasn't? Come on, a farm girl like Harry wouldn't notice her cat was in season? That is beyond unbelievable.I will definitely be reading new books in this series before buying after this."
1,3 times I have picked this book up and tried to read,Don't waste your money with this one it is terrible! Three times I have tried to read this book because I have loved all Rita Mae Brown's books in the sneaky pie series but this one is one of the worse books I have ever tried to read. I keep thinking well maybe if I can get past all the boring parts then things will pick up but NO THE NEXT PAGE IS MORE BORING THAN THE ONE BEFORE! What a disappointment I purchased this hardback as soon as it was put on the shelves and have not purchased another one since. So please tell me dear readers if you have gotten past this one and read the next in this series has Rita Mae Brown has gotten her muse back?
1,Service review,I did NOT receive the book that I had ordered. The one I received had the wrong ISBN number and was in large print. I was trying to get an exact copy of a Sour Puss book that a library claimed that I had returned damaged and was charging me $30 to replace. I returned the book that I had received from you and now it is too late to get the book with the correct ISBN that I had originally ordered. Needless to say I am extremely unhappy as I will have to pay that library $30.
3,Enjoyable but inaccurate!,"I have enjoyed all the Sneaky Pie Brown books, this one included. HOWEVER, the biological weapon information is inaccurate and unduly alarming! I hope no one reading this book takes this information as gospel. Do your homework if you are concerned about biological weapons."
1,Rating of more than one star quite generous....,"This is by far the worst in the series. When the pets sit around and discuss whether they'll be able to get on the bed, or not, because the humans are constantly having sex, it is time to move on to another writer. Like another reviewer, I have not been real happy with the direction the series has taken, because, quite frankly, I feel that the series has gotten lost.Maybe Sneaky Pie has writer's block."
2,Tedious,I was so hoping that Sour Puss would bring back what had been left behind in the latest books. I was disappointed. What was a wonderful series has now become a platform for politics. The characters have become even more high brow than ever. The animals who began the series as endearing are now just as boorish as many of the humans. Crozet has lost its charm and Brown is finding even more ways of offending readers north of the Mason-Dixon line. I wish Brown would read her earlier novels and re-visit the scene of earlier crimes. Cozet has been lost like many real towns to urban sprawl and over development
2,Not Brown's best,First book in the Mrs. Murphy series that I found boring. Definitely not Ms. Brown's best. Too much endless detail on wine making and too little concentration on characters.
2,Less science more mystery,"I too was disappointed in this book. I have also read all the previous ones and agree that Rita Mae Brown can get preachy at times. I will say that I was saddened when Harry decided to remarry Fair. It seemed the obvious way to go, but as an unmarried female in her 40s that is also owned by a brood of animals, I loved reading these books because Harry enjoyed being on her own, working in the fields and spending time with her animals and friends. There are so few books that portray single women of a ""certain"" age, that are genuinely happy with their lives. As I kept reading this, I kept putting it down saying to my animals, ""I really don't care about all the ways that grape vines can be ruined. I also agree with a fellow reviewer that we get enough about bird flu on the news. I read these books to escape the real world!!"
2,Disappointed,"Usually I cannot put down a ""Mrs. Murphy"" mystery, but this one is a big disappointment. It's a forum for Ms. Brown's political leanings. A mystery is thrown in as an afterthought. I was half-way through the book and still hadn't read anything about a body being found. I wanted to read an entertaining mystery not a how-to-book on wine making or lectures on global warming. When the next 'Mrs. Murphy"" book comes out, I'll just get it from the library instead of buying it."
1,Don't Get Your Hopes Up,"If you were hoping for the quality of the earlier Sneaky Pie Brown Mysteries, you will be very disappointed. The story reads as if Ms Brown downloaded facts on chemical warfare, fungus, cattle diseases and grape growing from the internet and then made a mediocre attempt to turn it into a story by inserting the folks of Crozet into the facts i.e ""She'd planted the rootstock herself in November, which would allow root growth over the winter. She planted each bare root eight feet from another. Her rows were also eight feet apart.....once the vines were established, she should produce one ton of grapes, which translated into fifty cases or six hundred bottles. One barrel of oak is the equivalent of twenty-five cases."" There is no interesting interaction between the characters. I gave up trying to get into the book after I read the above drivel from Chapter 9."
2,Not sure what to think..,"It maybe RMB has finally become financially comfortable enough to not work as hard at her books as in the past... maybe she is meeting new groups of people with her fame, maybe it's a combination of both or more. I'm not exactly sure, but this I do understand... Sour Puss is definitely not her best. It is too easy to figure out the plot just by reading the character introductions....Harry's character seems to wax and fawn over the Kluges and their social, financial and political views, and Harry just ain't the same...maybe she's mellowed a bit to much.RMB needs to really think about the direction this series is taking,,,is it animal and human communication, is it life on a semi-rural farm with suburban encroachment, is is the characters we've come to know so well, or is it a combination of all? That is something only time will tell.."
2,Sour Grapes,"First, let me say that I have loved the Mrs. Murphy series. Second, I have voluntarily read many of Ms. Brown's ""real"" novels in which she clearly expresses her political and social positions. BUT I did not buy this ""entertainment"" book to be bored stiff with political correctness, global warming and WMD's. The normal lovable characters are mere cardboard in this one to yet another ""famous"" personage lecturing on what we could get far cheaper on TV, radio, newspapers and magazines. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I will carefully check any further efforts in this series for mind numbing garbage before I plunk out another $25."
3,Not that bad!,"After reading some of the reviews, I thought this book was going to be terrible, but it's not that bad. We still have the wonderful citizens of Crozet, even though we don't see much of Miranda this time round. We also learn a lot about bioterrorism and about growing wine grapes, and that's OK too. Having Harry and Fair married again is also a treat, but it certainly has softened Harry. But I did find the book hurried along quite a bit, and this meant a softer plot line. I also found that the the tension buildup just wasn't there. I had figured out the killer about 1/3 of the way through, so there were no surprises. But I still enjoyed it, and mostly because of the wonderful characters."
2,Enough with the product placement!,"Can it be that Rita Mae makes more from awkwardly placed 'commercials for local products than from royalties? That's the only explanation I can come up with for theever increasing mentions of brands and services in her books.Give us a break and go back to the engaging, fanciful and delicious writing of RMB past!"
3,Slightly corked,"I really enjoyed the parts with the animals, but the human characters were not as well defined. Perhaps that is because this is part of a series, and the author assumes that readers already have considerable knowledge of the characters. But this was the first book I have read in this series, and I really don't feel compelled to read any others in it."
4,Great for the money,"These wipers do a great job, a little squeaky/streaky right now but probably will improve after a little more use. Instructions weren't the greatest, but since most all wipers are slightly different it just takes a few minutes looking it over to figure it out."
3,She's done better.,"After completing the Mayfair Witch series I was excited to get into another one of Rice's books. The first half of this book draggs on so much that I hated to pick it up again to see if it would get better, which, thnkfully, it did.If you are a music lover you will identify with this book to a point that may make you cry, and if you have an obsession with death you can surely relate to this book, too."
2,mmm...not so much,I bought this game off the bargain shelf last week and I am pretty disappointed in it. Although the reviews mention the game's humor it was not apparant after the game began and for the few hours I played through it.I did not think the graphics were good even for a 1st generation PS2 game. The camera is pretty bad and induces motion sickness. Objectives in the game are not readily apparant. A lot of the game seems to involve switching to a sniper-scope targeting system. Unfortunately you can not really move and fire at the same time.I would instead recommend the bargain title Oni which seems to be sort of in the same style but has much better game play and cool style.
3,"Good, but not great","I was gonna buy this game..but good thing I rented it first. I'm glad I didn't buy it. Not because it's a bad game..First of all, you expect 60fps gameplay. But you get 30fps. Second, this game has a cartoony feel to it. Sometimes you will think this game was designed for 5 year olds. The controls are a little confusing too. Then again, I am not a big fan of adventure games. I prefer First person shooters or racing games. Good game overall."
1,magaine order art in america,its over a month and I have not received anything. Nothing has come. There isn't a thing i my box. Nada.Zip. Zilch. Zero.
4,Excellent Up-to-the-Minute Reviews,"I have been reading Art in America for the past two years. I intend to subscribe to it forever because it is excellent in its review of gallery and museum exhibitions as well as new books on art. Interviews with ""art people""--such as collectors, curators, and artists--are entertaining and generally well written. My only complaint is that it is shoddily copy edited (if copy edited at all); I often find terms misused and/or misspelled. The pictures are glorious."
4,Good for finding gallery exhibits and shows.,"A lot of ads for NYC galleries so this is especially appealing to the Metro NYC population. I'm from Boston but travel to NYC for fun stuff like shows, shopping, and museums. Ergo, it holds interest for me as well. There could be a little more beef in the issues as one can not survive on fatty advertizing."
2,Not that great!,My son got it for Christmas last year when he was six months old. He never really played with it. Sound isn't that great...the batteries just died and it sits there in the toy box.
4,9 month old boy,"I've been wanting to get this toy for my son ever since he was born. My goddaughter had this toy and she LOVED it and played with it constantly- and it was educational! I like the old leap frog drum a lot better though (the one she had) because it had a level for JUST letter and JUST numbers- and this new one doesn't; just mostly letters. THAT was a little disappointing, but he still loves it, especially since he knows how to work it now. I would give it a 4 star rating as a whole."
3,"Great music, but not much of a drum!","I want to start off this review saying that my one year old son loves the music from this drum! He will hit it to get the music going, but then dances around; he does not continue to hit it. If you are looking for a drum, look elsewhere. If you are looking for something to provide musical entertainment, this this might fit the bill.The cons are that you can barely hear the drum sound when the child hits it during the music mode, and the ""high"" volume setting is not very high at all.The pros include: it is very durable, the light display is fun, and the music is lively & catchy."
3,A little boring,"this toy was good for my daughter when she was a baby and just beginning to walk and talk, but now she's bored of it. It was good for very basic play but as soon as she was ready for more advanced play (probably 1 year old) she became bored with it.Just a personal peeve also, it constantly repeats the invitations to play, so prepared to have those drilled into your brain every time it's used."
2,Kinda Lame,"The problem with this drum is that it's always playing music, on any of the three settings (except on one setting, but only when it's lying sideways?!), so a child cannot learn cause and effect: to associate his/her own beating on it with it making a sound."
5,Loads of fun and educational too!,"My two year old got this for Christmas last year and has been enjoying it ever since. Very fun and educational too. Kids like to bang on things, so why not have the alphabet answer them!"
4,Great toy,"This product is fun, durable, useful and interesting. However, I didn't find it to be valuable as an educational tool. The alphabet is not very practical for very little children who are learning the alphabet but might be for those kids who have already mastered it and can recognize letters as a review tool. All the same it is a great toy and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,ok,son played with it for a little while. wasn't very loud. spanish option is neat but could hardly ehar it.
1,item does not work,"This package arrived on time, however, the packaging was not damaged. The item was damaged. Batteries were placed inside the toy, but they corroded inside the toy. New batteries did not make it work."
2,It wont be quiet long enough to hear the drums.,I got this for my son for Christmas. It was a nice price and is built good but it wont be quiet long enough for you to hear the drums. Also when you hit the drums you can barely hear them. The good thing is that it is in spanish as well.
3,"1 dimensional product, possibily sending mixed messages.",Love the idea of spanish and english alphabet. My baby doesn't seem that interested in the product though. I keep on thinking perhaps I could have bought a more multi-functional item for him to learn his ABCs. Also not sure it is a great idea to encourage him to hit/bang on things.... He gets mixed messages when it is OK to bang on drum or hit drum.. but not the dog/glass tables etcs..
4,I Like It More Than My Child,"I think this is a great little toy, and it holds my interest for a while. But, unfortunately it's not holding my 13 month old daughter's interest at the moment. Hopefully that will change soon. I don't find the music annoying, and the 3 different learning settings and 2 languages make this feel like more than one toy."
1,not a good purchase,"I bought the toy for my then 9 month old dd because she loves this old fashioned kiddie drum that she has already. It's not completely touch sensitive, and the volume at best is a loud whisper. She'll play with it for about one minute and then move onto something else... she doesn't even seem happy to use it."
2,Don't do it...don't be a sucker,This is the worst toy ever. I have never felt so robbed since the idea of a healthy twinkie!First off and very important...one cannot actually drum on this toy. My kid lost interest quickly.the music is annoying. Constant. The toy tries to draw you in by talking and talking and talking until you hit it. This seems violent to me ^_^. but when you start to hit if you tilt it at all it will reset and the annoying voice starts all over again. The voice isn't annoying so much as needy.It is surprisingly durable...but I would really rather a better toy.I happen to have an earlier model and it is also durable not quite as annoying...I bought this one because it is bilingual but not worth it. Don't be a sucker...walk away
3,Hum Drum,My son received this toy when he was 20 months old. He had more fun playing with the language and volume switches on the side than he did banging on the drum. It didn't keep his interest for more than three minutes.You have to be sure to turn this toy off when your child is finished with it since it's motion-sensitive and will start singing out of the blue if it gets knocked or someone runs by.
4,"Good Toy, Not as Fun as I Expected","I bought this toy for my nephew for his first birthday. He seems to turn all of his toys over to bang on them, so I figured the drum was a great gift for him. It makes noise when you bang on the top of it, but I think you have to hit it harder than necessary for a toy meant for a young age group. It is bright, colorful, and makes noise, so I'm sure he will enjoy it. I guess I just expected a little more from it."
4,nice drum,My LO is 11 months- he likes to bang on it or crawl after it. I think he will like it more as he gets older.
2,Don't waste your money,"I always research most items before I decide to purchase, and found this drum to have a good rating here before I bought this drum for my 1yr old daughter for Christmas. I found out that this toy is really very low-budget and not at all on pace with the quality of learning toys on the market these days. The bad: Top of drum has a very cheesy display of letters and pictures. The batteries were dead on arrival. The drum hardly does anything, and barely holds my daughter's interest for more than a minute or so. The good: This does seem to be a tough toy that can take many drops. That is all that is good. I was so sad because I was at Goodwill and they had not just one, but TWO of these drums on their toy shelf for 99 cents a piece. Definitely a rip off to buy at full price. There are so many other great learning toys out there, don't bother with this one."
2,Not a Drum,"The biggest problem with this toy is that it's not a drum. A drum would make drum sounds. This toy is so full of electronics that there's no room left for it to make drum noises. A toddler would probably enjoy the lights and sounds, but if you want a drum, I recommend getting something else. Additionally, the alphabet feature is age-inappropriate for babies."
3,Fun with a few irritating factors,"My sons have both played with this toy and enjoyed it. The only drawbacks in my eyes are the fact that it somehow senses when you are walking past and ""wakes up"" and starts making noise, and it also says ""Bye-bye"" or ""adios"" when it's turned off. Not a big complaint but I just want it to be OFF when it's off! Mommy is really the only one who actually turns it off!"
2,Definitely not as good as the real thing.,"A bigger hit then the maracas that came with it, my kids have very little interest in the drum and rarely play with it. The drum requires hitting right on the top to get it to play the alphabet, and hard enough it's not too easy for really young babies. My guys get way more entertainment from hitting the drum when it's off. Next time I'd buy them a real one instead."
4,Fun musical toy,"My daughter really enjoys this toy and so do I. She seemed to understand that you bang on the top right away, and the music catches her attention. The English/Spanish options are great since we're teaching both languages in my household."
3,Not as much fun as I thought,"This drum looked cute when I purchased it but once we played with it I was dissapointed. There just doesn't seem to be enough of a response when my 11 month old drums on it. The alphabet mode is defintely the best of the 3 modes, with the letters coming up. But the other modes continually play music to where when my daughter hits it, there isn't really a reaction, just continuing the music. She has never really had interest in this toy. Maybe she will later but for now it's going in the toy chest."
3,"This drum is interesting, but needy","I was very impressed with this toy when I saw it on the shelves, and we do still use it, but this is one of those ""needy"" electronic toys that demands attention even when the baby is done playing with it. I find that incredibly annoying. My son may have moved on to another thing, and the drum will suddenly shout for his attention, distracting him from whatever he had moved on to. It's like the toy is saying, ""Um, excuse me! We're not done playing yet here!""This is further exacerbated by the fact that you can't turn it off quietly. So if you want the thing to stop making noise, you either wait for it to shut itself down (tricky, because it may turn on again the next time you walk close to it) or turn it off yourself. Either way, it will say, ""Bye bye!"" and strum a chord.Ultimately, fewer bells and whistles would have made this a superior toy."
5,Great musical toy,My daughter loves this drum. She is 5-months old and loves to bang on it and roll it around. It can be set to English or Spanish settings. Babies can learn to experiment with music and older kids can learn the alphabet (in 2 languages).
2,Small,I was expecting it to be larger than it was. I was very small. I don't think it holds an entire cup.
5,An Excellent Book for anyone buying or selling a diamond!,"B.J. Tadena's book on buying and selling diamonds is truly an execellent and vital resource for anybody in the market for buying and selling diamonds. I would recommend this book especially for guys looking for engagement rings for their significant other. Tadena gives a very informative and in-depth look at the finer points of picking out diamonds and their good qualities and how to spot imperfections, without boring the reader but giving inciteful knowledge a consumer can understand. I would defintely recommend this book to anyone in the market for diamonds, be it personal pleasure, an investment, or just a special way to say ""I Love You"""
4,A nod and a wink to Jimi,"Billy Childish has been releasing lo-fi garage rock in a myriad of contexts for decades. His latest joint, the Buff Medways, is a little more lighthearted than some of his other bands such as Thee Headcoats. The two albums I've heard by the Buffs seem to pay tribute to rockers of yesteryear. This Is This uses Hendrix as it's inspiration. Several of the tracks are virtual rewrites of Hendrix tunes. However, Billy is no mere copyist and each track is firmly stamped with the sound we've come to associate with The Milkshakes/Headcoats/etc.A recommended album for those of you who like the garage rock sound but have found Billy's previous releases to be a bit samey."
5,My first book ever and the best as well...,"In this book, I find myself very good at memorizing the capital cities of each country. My I.Q. was improved by this book. Circling the book is one of the best atlas books ever made. They give additional information about every country, its emblem, facts and figures, delicacies and even some languages. Reading the whole books is even better than just peeking at its pictures. Worth the read! ^_^enjoy"
2,Beware -- Small size is REALLY small!,The description says these are for people weighing up to 130 lbs but I'd take that with a grain of salt. I'm a 110-lb woman and I couldn't even get them up over my calves! I had to exchange them for a medium.
1,Good when it lasts,"The first pair I ordered developed a tear near the seam at the bottom end. I ordered another one thinking I would take better care of it and keep it from ripping -- unfortunately, I don't think it was the lack of care that caused the tear, it's just a faulty product. If I have to hazard a guess, I think it's because of the straight seam, where most of the stress develops on the material. It developed a tear at the same location after just 4 uses! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
1,TK knee bands mediums,"I bought TK knee bands very pleased with the first set , they lasted 7 to 8 months of daily heavy use. This last pair were terrible they lasted 5 weeks ! Not happy !"
2,TK Knee Bands,"I tried the TK Knee Bands on advice from a lifter that I know. The second time that I wore them the band on my left knee toreabout half way down. I don't know if it there was a flaw in that band, but I don't think that I would buy these again."
5,Knee Support,I weigh 186 and am not a body builder and had difficulty with the mediums. They were tight and pulled on the leg hair all the way up. Ouch! I figured out that if you turn them inside out and pull the bottom up under the knee and flip the top up over the knee then adjust the bottom part was much easier to get them on. They are comfortable once they were in position and give great support.
1,Split seam after 2 months,Split the seam on one of them after 2 months. I liked them up until the point one split. I tad had to get on too. Rips your hair out.
4,"Good, but tight","I weight around 190lbs, have been squatting for about a year. I got the medium sized ones since I'm under 250, and let me tell you...they're tight. I wish I would have listened to the other reviewer and ordered the large. Anyway...they fit, but they're tight - which makes them hard to put on."
2,"Felt Great At First, Durability Sucks!","I put some chalk on the inside of these before putting on, folded in half like stated in the directions and they did go on somewhat easier. However, after about 6-7 sessions, a small tear developed on one of them. No way to repair this and after a few more sessions, the tear just continued to get larger until I can now no longer use.I gave 2 stars because they did work, kept my knees really warm, and helped to make my heavy deadlift and squat sessions more intense. But at $40/pair, they should be more durable.I'm going to give the Grizzly knee sleeves a shot, I use their wrist supports which have been nothing short of amazing for me in terms of performance!"
3,Working well until the fail.,"Like others have written, my knee band ripped right along the sleeve going almost halfway up. I had the bands for about 8 months before that happened. Until the rip though they were great. I was hoping for more longevity out them."
5,Awesome!,I live the T.K. bands! They help a lot stabilize my knees and on all major and heavy lifts. They offer great support especially when you have bad knees like mine. I recommend!
4,I Am Pleased,"The TK knee bands do as advertised and take a bit of the strain off my stiff, tender knees. I do think they give decent support as well as provide a substantial warming effect to the knee area. My knees are very sweaty when I remove them so they do generate some heat. Although I bought the medium and don't have large legs, I found that they are a little difficult to get on and I always use talcum powder to help. I am glad I bought the wraps and use them whenever I do any exercises that are hard on the knees."
1,I was very disappointed,"The promo grossly mispresented the product. There were numerous depictions of heavily muscled Hugh individuals wearing these knee braces. I am 73 years old with a long history of knee problems and many knee braces. My legs are of normal size and I have been comfortable with large or XL knee braces most of which have fully adjustable. I am in need of some new braces, so I ordered a pair. When I got them, I found them absolutely impossible to get them above my calves, never mind getting to my knees? I am very unhappy."
2,pi$$d off,"I had two pairs blow out on me. the 1st pair lasted about 4 months and the last pair lasted a lil longer. im 5'10"" and around 215, i ordered the large pair like i was supposed too.i just ordered the Rehband 7mm Knee Sleeve. hopefully i have better luck on these ones."
2,TK Knee Bands- Returned,"As my husband was looking for the Tommie Copper knee bands, these were totally different. The website kept bringing me to Amazon, however these were not what my husband wanted."
3,Fast delivery and product was as expected,Fast delivery and product was as expected. It is a great product but it is made of very thick materials so it is hard to put on. If you want to do very heavy squat and nothing else then it is great.
5,Great! So Universal,"Hello. I love this bedding. I bought this bedding for my son. It is so universal. It is really soft. It's not too much boy or girl so it really works out. It was really reasonable priced. The only problem I'm having is finding curtins I like to go with the bedding, I really do not like the small valance due to the cold months. But I would recommend this to anyone, you have so many choices you could paint your room depending on the sex of your child, yellow, light green or a blue. So it really works."
4,Great blend of overview and detail...,"Mr. Lewis has brought together old and new concepts in a way that is beneficial to the entire spectrum of IT professionals. Data Warehouse architects, modelers, and managers will appreciate the overview and detail of E-Commerce projects, especially with regard to how data is used and accessed with new technology. E-Commerce specialists will gain value from the areas related to database storage and metadata processes.Most importantly, both business and IT managers will gain both an overall and detailed understanding of how Data Warehouse and E-Commerce projects work in concert. This book complements well my library of books by Imhoff, Inmon, and others."
5,can't go wrong with super sensitive,"i'm 23 at the time of writing this, and have been using super sensitive dark since i was 8. works great. has a wonderful amount of bite and traction.be aware though, that if you use too much, your sound gets too scratchy and your strings and violin will be covered with a white residue that eats up your violin, destroying the finish. i'm going to buy super-sensitive polish and see what that can do."
5,I Love Pitchy!!!,"I'm listening to this CD as I type this. I love Proj. Pitch!!!! I really think they're a band without classification or peer in their genre. Not industrial, not techno...just their own thing. My local Goth/Rivithead clubs (Sabbat/Therepy)refuse to play them when I request it, but it's great music. I think Chakra is a bit more dance oriented than their other albums. It's like a strange mix of Skinny Puppy and New Order. From the other reviews, I see that other people don't like this CD as much as the other Pitchy CD's, but it you like Eon:Eon and Alpha:Omega, I think you'll probably like this one."
1,They try too hard,"Each song came out of a cookie-cutter recepie for what an industrial song is supposed to sound like. They are indistinguishable from so many other bands out there, you won't be able to tell the difference between them and say, 80% of the other goth- filler you hear in any club."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I was so excited when top gun came out I rushed out and bought it the day of its release.What a mistake. Imust admit the graphics and detail to landscapes are impressive but the actual realtime play is confusing. One huge example, when you kick in the afterburners to chase a bogey or escape enemy fire or missles or rockets may involuntarily launch and/or the screen will change. for example if you are in the cockpit you may instantly be viewing your fighter from different angles outside of the plane. I give 3 stars for graphics and special fxs. Better luck next time Titus"
4,Nice game... but connection to the movie is lost,"This is a nice game. I am not a highly skilled gamer (I am 33 yrs old), so I cannot get technical about the details. The number one complain is that,despite the title TOP GUN, the game has no connection to the movie. I purchased it in part for the movie theme.I played the entire game. The graphics are very good. The controls are also okay. I have just purchased Ace Combat 4 ( and never played it before), so I cannot compare them yet.The game was fun. I really liked it. If you are looking for a nice flight simulation game, with some hard action when you keep being pounded by enemy fire, this is the game for you."
2,WHAT IN THE HECK WERE THEY THINKING,"This game would be alright if the controls were better. The analog is very confusing....you'll probably get it after 2 YEARS!!!...NOT...it is hard and the graphics are good, the turning is the difficult part, if you're not used to using the rudders with L1 and R1, then don't buy this game!!!The analog controls going up and down and barrel rolls."
2,Top Gun is not Top Gun!,"Ok I bought this game 1 hour ago and I'm already thinking of excusses to take it back! This game has nice graphics, but it feels like I'm flying in an air ballon!! Do all the planes blow up with one hit?! I prefere they fly around alittle more with some smoke and then die?! I'm playing it tonight for a couple of hours but in the morning I'm going back to (the store)! (...)"
2,Top Gun,"For real action and excitement try Ace Combat 4. Top Gun ""Combat Zones"" is not worth the money. I do admit the graphics are better than AC4, but the playability does not even deserve to be in the same class as AC4."
2,hardest thing about this game... taking it back!,"I already have ace combat 4. and thought that this would be a nice change of pace. i was right, it was. Now if I were in an old folks home I might enjoy this game better than getting an enema. Heed all the negative reviews! or just send me 50 bones and I'll gladly send you my copy. (only used once!)"
1,BORING! Lacks realism. Underwhelming graphics!,"A little bias here, as I'm a former pilot. The training missions are guaranteed to leave you droopy-eyed and frustrated. Controls and flight parameters aren't very realistic, especially for Tomcat and Harrier. I was also underwhelmed by the overall graphics; the canyon runs can't hold a candle to canyon runs in Star Wars: Starfighter As an example, terrain features ""pop-up"" too obviously, making it hard to keep flight situational awareness and really get into the ""experience.""This game DEFINITELY does not deliver the ""MACH-3 with your hair on fire"" experience I expected. Do yourself a favor and rent before dropping full retaill on this slug."
3,Nice Game to Play,This is no ace combat game but its still a lot of fun to play on cold northen winter days.
3,"""Reviews""","Why don't you all stop writing ""reviews"" until you've actually played the game. Some of you talk about how you can't give 5 stars b/c you haven't played it yet...Why even bother giving your measly one star that only brings the ratings down for it? The ones that say they're ""balancing"" things out b/c people give 5 stars for a game they haven't played are just as bad b/c they're giving 1 star for a game they haven't played either. Some people don't realize how stupid they make themselves sound. I'll give this 3 stars b/c it's right in the middle, and no I haven't seen the game yet."
1,Old school...,"I remeber playing the original ""Top Gun"" game on my old NES and it was simply Gody! The game was great! As a fan of the movie and the old NES game This should be good.But like the other person said I cant give it 5 stars till I actually play the game!"
2,Complete Waste Of Money,"This game has a great title and nice pictures on the box, but the graphics are poor and the game is not very fun!"
3,Gets boring!,At first like all games I couldn't stop playing it. But after a couple days it didn't appeal to me. Now I haven't played it in over 4 months but the game play is vair. It has good controls but wrecks your r2 button cause you have to use that button alot. So no it dosen't work that well. Go ahead and try the game you might like it.
5,cool,"Awesome game.its awesome because there are lots of missions.The graphics are bad , but its ok.The bombing stinks.You have to go on top of the plane to bomb and its hard to do that.Anyways, its cool."
4,Very Good Workout for the Bass,"Marvin Taylor's play-along CD is excellent. From the energetic countoffs, to the real tracks with which you play, it is top quality. To make it more user friendly for the novice, some typical licks in notation and/or tablature would be nice. But, if you ""get"" the chord changes and already have some technique, it is an excellent play-along CD. The only reason that it doesn't rate 5 stars is that it is so 12-bar blues heavy that it's easy to get lulled into using the same shuffle pattern for tune after tune."
3,Its OK,"Got this in June, 2011 and have used it about 20-30 times since.It heats well in the microwave but for it to hold on to the heat, it will have to be microwaved on the both sides for atleast 5-7mins.<Update-5Nov2012>The cloth tore off and the beads fell out, even though I put it in the oven for only 3mins.</Update-5Nov2012>"
2,Poor quality,"This item worked well for a short period of time, but then it spontaneously broke open in our microwave.A zillion tiny little beads spilled out, went everywhere, and took an hour to clean up."
2,Not as good as Big Brother,"I own the larger version of this product, designed for the back and it has worn like iron. I routinely heat that one well beyond the manufacturer's guildelines with no problems experienced at all. It holds heat extremely well. Now, to the subject at hand. These smaller versions do not stay hot. Also, they are totally inflexible so if you intend, like me, to use it on a shoulder it does not conform to the shape of your shoulder at all. If you are dealing with a flat body part, i.e. a thigh, perhaps it would be suitable but, I warn you, it does not hold heat long enough to be therapeutic."
3,"Dee, Florida","I gave the heating pad a 3 star only because of the way I need to use it. I suffer with muscles spasms and need to use it 20 minutes heat then 20 minutes ice, several times. REHEATING According to the instructions you need to leave this pad open to the air for 2 TWO hours, to absorb moisture before reheating. Covering is sturdy and I do not feel it will tear apart in 6 months like the gel ones."
2,Ruptured within first week of use!,"My boyfriend has owned the identical item for 12 years and has never had a problem with it. I micro-waved the pack for 2 minutes and 40 seconds (the same amount of time we have always used to micro-wave the older pack), and one of the seams burst. This happened after only half a dozen uses. It's frustrating because I otherwise like this product."
2,DON'T DO IT!,"I give it only 2 stars. The only warning that comes with it is NOT to heat it in the chintzy bag that comes with it. For whatever reason, when I heated it for 2 minutes in my microwave last week, it pulled open, spilling therabeads into my oven. That's the second one I've had do that, so won't try another! I'll just use a wet towel in a plastic bag from now on! Wish I could get my money back.The last one was in a pillow case when it came apart, but this one was just on the turntable."
4,Microwavable Duro-Med Moist Pad,"I like the size, both the dimensions and the thickness. I find that it is not always consistent in the length of time it holds the heat."
4,Comfort,This theraband is awesome. It heats up quickly and provides relief for my arthritic joints. Easy to pop in the micro and plot on sore joints. I've had mine for a little over a month and have used it almost daily. Still going storng. Knocked off a star for the scent.It would be ideal to add some lavendar or another natural yet pleasant scent as opposed to the beany aroma.
1,Bogus,"After using only a handful of times, this thing split open in the microwave spreading tiny beads all over the place. It never got very hot, no matter how much time I gave it. Yet this time, not only did it burst open, it broke my microwave plate into pieces and I've had to replace that at $56.23. The little beads have also gone down inside the turntable axis and now it no longer turns. A reimbursement of this cost as well as the cost of this bogus heating pad + shipping is in order, as far as I'm concerned. The thing is an ineffective hazard. I'm lucky I didn't cut myself on the glass shards when cleaning up the mess. In addition, the white beads inside are so tiny they are now all over the kitchen and have rolled in between the floor boards. This item should truly be taken off the market."
4,Moist heat for pain relief,"I use this pad daily before I exercise my wrist and fingers. I had wrist surgery for lacerated tendons and ulnar nerve 6 weeks ago. The moist heat helps with the stiffness and pain. The heat last about 30 minutes after a 1 minute cycle in the microwave. My only disappointment is that I purchased the 9x12 size thinking I could wrap it around my wrist but it is not large enough. The baffle style keeps it from bending the 12 inch length, but it will bend the 9 inch width. Even though I'm small boned, 9 inches with baffles covers just the sides and bottom of my wrist. If I was to order over again I would purchase a 12x16. The pad cover is very cheap...made out of some type of disposable material."
1,delicate,"bot 2, both broke within 2 months, developed a hole when heated for 3 min . You cannot heat these things for 3 minutes. heat it for 2 min and its only mildly warm. Going back to the clay ones"
3,Thought it would be bigger,"Nice quality, does not stay hot as long as I'd like. Cover kinda flimsy, I made a better one. I bought this 2 years ago and it is still in use."
3,Not so good quality,"It was hard enough to find a needle with a wide diameter, by a decent price, but also the little bolt on the side of the handle does not hold the needle tight enough. We had to rethread the inside thread and to find another little bolt for holding that needle tightly pressed inside the handle. :-(. It works though"
1,Didnt work,"Punch needle seem to be quite complicated, this one is really thick so didnt work for my girlfriend, we bought another one that looks like a pencil and you can find if you look for punch needles in youtube.Its easier with the youtubes punch needle because we can apply all instructional videos!No punch needle brings instructions!"
1,"three deliveries, and broken each time!!","I had bought this as a wedding gift. After many amazon emails to me, I believed that the gift was delivered properly. The bride then informed me that she had had to send it back 3 times! Each time it was redelivered, it was in many pieces. She finally told me, and I sent a gift card in its place. All of this took one month. I will never pick out a breakable gift through amazon again...That is, if I choose amazon in future!"
5,Breathtaking!,A perfect and relaxing mixture of sounds with unequalled vocals (a diamond in the rough waiting to be discovered!). I was impressed from the beggining to the end of the album! I highly recommend this album to all ages. Great stress reliever after a hard day at work or anywhere!!!!!!!! Hats off to ya Mary! Looking forward to your next new album! :-)
3,"Good content, mediocre photography","Enjoyed the content----interesting. Mediocre photography quality. Not a professional quality, but an interesting watch anyway. Would be appropriate for younger school groups or home family watching."
5,Review by Photographer,"A found ""Earth's Elders"" to be a deeply inspiring, and profoundly life-affirming work of art."
4,Savor the stories,"I really like this book. It is as I expected. The rules of living a long life are easily garnered from the stories of the elders. I save the stories for when I travel from my island home on Bell Island ,NL. They help pass the time as the boat rolls along... I don't enjoy the boat so the elders' keep me so interested I forget where I am.."
2,Lacking the depth to reveal any true wisdom,"When someone applies their talents to an almost sacred subject as ""The Wisdom of the World's Oldest People"" you expect more. You expect depth. You expect to find some actual and tangible pieces of this great wisdom hinted at in the title. Instead this work feels superficial having too little substance and too much of the author's opinions and suppositions.Many of these stories are presented as if there was some kind of injustice done, as if the reader is somehow responsible and owes the subject some apology for living such a life. If these centenarians were a bit more articulate I believe they would profoundly disagree.One hundred years ago life was both different and more difficult, but it was universally so. Almost everyone lived different versions of the lives presented. The author seems almost unaware of this fact, lamenting imagined injustices rather than celebrating the richness and fullness of the lives lived."
5,It captures the emotions of a parent letting go,"Although the divorce is pivotal in this story, it is not necessarily the key to the book's essence. Any parent who has reached the point of letting go can relate to the emotions the author so wonderfully describes. If a reader is an avid baseball fan, especially Little League, Pony League, Babe Ruth, etc., the story jumps out at you and transports you to that ""magic"" only summer youth baseball can take you. As the mother of three children, two who are finished with youth baseball and softball, and one still keeping me in the ""magic"" at the age of 13, I loved the book. Mr. Gent deals with emotions like unconditional love, fear, apprehension,regret and wins during that Last Magic Summer."
5,Very good book - Peter Gent's best work!,"Very good book. This is a very touching story of Gent and his family and his relationship with his son. It is his best work in my opinion! Very glad he published his story. Before he pasted away he was unable to finished a book he was writing. I hope that book will one day be completed by a trusted writer, family member and/or friend."
5,Well written and amusing,"I definitely liked this book. The characters were amusing - at times (especially the ending), I found myself laughing at their interactions. And I must admit it was a great change not to have to deal with the usual sexual intonations (girl meets boy, boy and girl feel incredible sex appeal at first sight, etc), at least not between the primary protagonists. In fact, I very much liked the basis of the story of love on a steady and strong friendship, overall."
4,A good read;,"Overall, I really liked this book. It had some great character developments, and some intriguing side characters. Lord Rival is one interesting jerkhead, and I'm glad he's got a book of his own. Chloe and Gil are pretty run-of-the mill leads, but I ended up quite liking them in the end.Oh, and I caught so many Heyer-references which made me smile and squeal throughout the book. Seriously guys, the Marquis of Alverstroke bringing out his beautiful cousin?!?! Plus, Tish and Robert drew so many parallels with the side couple in The Black Moth and These Old Shades that I *instantly* realized how it was all going down. Truthfully, I have to say that Heyer does it so much better in terms of writing and style, but I guess in the wake of such greatness Diane Farr is reasonably good, too.It was worth the time and the money, and I don't regret it a bit, but do take the time to read a Heyer novel if you find yourself enjoying this regency."
2,"Bland, Could have been better","I like the storyline and I was hoping that there'd be more interaction between Gil and Chloe. I didn't fall for the hero as he seemed to be quite shallow (only cared about appearances) and just a bit immature (seemingly cowed by the peasant and by his Mom). He also pretty much took Chloe for granted, if he was such a good friend wouldn't he have spent more time with Chloe? And when he started feeling attracted to her why didn't he try to get her alone. I was actually hoping that Lord Rival would prove to be a decent person and that Chloe and he would end up together. There seemed to be more sizzle between Chloe and Lord Rival rather than Chloe and Gil."
5,Charming Regency romance in the tradition of Georgette Heyer,"Disclaimer: I am Diane Farr's critique partner, though I did not work on Falling for Chloe. However, I do love Diane's writing, so was predisposed to enjoy Falling for Chloe. This novel is fill of Diane's sharp wit as well as sly references to Heyer's work, which will delight Regency fans. Highly recommended!"
4,good fun read,"I enjoyed this story. Best friends wind up engaged because of a notice published in the newspaper. They are not sure who sent the notice in. However, his mother really thinks they are perfect together and it is time to marry and start producing grandchildren. They fight it but the things they go through and experience makes for an interesing read. In the end love conquers all. It was a fun read and I enjoyed the book. A few minor bad guys but nothing to distract from the story and it had a happy ending. I loved it. I like to feel good when I finish a book and I did. Highly recommend for an entertaining read."
3,Charming,"It was a charming book read in one day. Had a little but of an ""Emma"" feel to it. Best friends since child hood, mischievousness, and rakes."
1,Never got it,I have not received the book yet. I was supposed to have got it last week...What I should I do? Where should I call or go? Thank you.
2,Gray Zone Wanderers,"Normally, people think of haunted mansions in the Old South of the USA, or castles in the British Isles when the word ghost is mentioned. However, ghost stories come from all parts of the world. In this book, you will read about the spectres of Norway. Monks, haunted ships, mysterious music, and grey ladies linger. Each story is reported matter -of-factly, in such a way as to simply state what the author has discovered. If you enjoy shows like Beyond Belief or In Search Of, then you will likely find these simple tales to be your cup of tea.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,Watch it for the slasher badness,"This is a lame ripoff of ""Halloween"" but horror buffs should still enjoy it for the trademark late 70s-early 80s awfulness in the horror genre."
3,Original storylines,"I have to say while watching the Boogeyman, I did laugh at the murders. It is almost as if they were intended to be funny. However, I am not going to say this was terrible. The storyline was really unique. The broken mirror shining on the teens across the lake is way out there and over the top. Yes, it terribly acted and directed. But unique.The Devonsville Terror was better acted and directed. I found this one intriguing and interesting to watch. A much better film. All in all, worthy of a purchase at least for the drive-in feel of the movies."
1,A great comedy,This movie had me rolling on the floor laughing at how bad it was (Boogeyman). The story seems like it was made up by a 10 year old kid and the acting seems like it was directed by a 10 year old kid. A haunted mirror?!?! Sorry that would never put chills down my spine no matter how the story is spun. In one scene some members of the family are walking through a barn in the middle of the night and see some of their relatives dead and hung. What do they do? scream? run? cry? nope they move deeper in the barn without even pausing. HORRIBLE MOVIE!
1,A total waste of time,"I will put it clearly: it is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. I really love this kind of flicks, I always defend the worth of horror trash movies, but Boogeyman lacks of gore, imagination, and suspense. Don't waste your time."
1,Extra: Ayn Rand Rolling Over In Her Grave!,"To have invoked Ayn Rand's name in promotion of this book is simply shameless. Tales of the Mall Masters stinks... plain and simple. I was enthusiastic to read it based on its promotion and, out of habit more than anything else, read it through all the way to the end. From the silly, ridiculous notions of what an ""Objectivist society"" might look like, to the absurdly melodramatic finale, this book is nothing more than a piece of trash. Don't buy it, don't read it. If there was a ""negative stars"" rating, I would have used it for this book."
2,A likeable concept mired in 6th-grade-level writing skills,"I am a big fan of libertarian science fiction (Heinlein, Vinge, etc.), so I was looking forward to reading this book. However, from the very first page it was clear that I was going to be disappointed. The writing is, simply, bad. There's an interesting story in there, begging to be let out. I think a good book may have been salvaged if it had undergone some extensive editing and re-writing."
1,Objectivism and Bad Art,"Until Objectivists realize that they do no favors to the philosophy by forcing their trite, derivative prose on the masses and invoking Ayn Rand's name, they'll never get anywhere in fiction. Terrible, just terrible."
4,Great for a good clean!,"This product was given to me from my godmother and it was amazing!! The fact that you can peel the mask off you can see every little pore in your face! The best part is, it does whiten the skin. But you have to use this long term, using this once will not give you skin as white as a baby's bottom. I've been using it for almost a year and when you need a good deep cleansing mask this does the job. Just remember not to get it on your eyebrow, that will not be a pretty sight. The mask does not come off in one easy pull and sometimes there will be some hard to peel parts that require a wipe down with your face cloth."
3,Nothing to write home about.,"I've been using this mask on and off for almost a year. The consistency is sort of runny, so you must apply a lot of the product to get a thick, and even layer. You need a thick even layer to peel the mask effectively, otherwise you end up with random patches of black mask that you have to scrub off. I tend to you this mask when I feel that my pores need extra cleansing. When applied correctly, its definitely effective at removing those random stubborn blackheads, however be careful of your brows because this stuff really adheres to your skin and WILL remove hair. It's not worth the price, in my opinion and I'm not certain how it allegedly whitens."
3,"Alright, maybe I need to test it out a bit longer","THe product smells good and after drying it holds together and pulls off as one sheet without lots of tearing. I didn't notice any significant difference after using it. It didn't pull out a lot of stuff from my face and I especially was hoping it would clean up my nose. Overall my skin is pretty good though, so that could be why there wasn't a dramatic affect. I also have only used it once so far and it may need several usages to prove itself."
2,Not impressed,I was looking for an amazing product to use in my esthetics practice and read that this is better than Biore pore strips...I found it to be quite the contrary. It is not strong enough to pull all compactions out from the pores. It is now just sitting on my shelf. I have even offered clients to take it.
1,Far Too Drying,"This mask goes on nicely and makes your face feel clean and tingly while it's drying. That's the good part.The bad part is when you actually take off the mask... I would consider it a form of torture. It will suck out all the moisture from your face, and leave it feeling unhealthy. Also, if you have even a small pimple, it will pull it right off. Unless you have extremely well hydrated, clear skin to begin with, this mask is probably not for you. And in that case, you probably don't need the mask."
2,Too dry to white your skin,"This mask, as well as Biotherm's mask, could clean your skin and promise users to white skin, and they have familiar touch, smell and effect. However do not expect it too much, i think.It is too dry, specially for the dry skin, as me, after using this mask, all spots in my face is even more visible. my face just like field which based drought stress.....so, without hydro supply, how can it make your skin white?"
1,More a novelty than a beauty product.,"Fun little peel off mask- as in, it's cool to peel off..my daughter gets a kick out of it. However, I didn't buy this for fun, I bought this for brighter skin. Waste of money.I bought it because reviewers said it was stong enough to pull hair off- I figured if it could do that, it should be good for removing dead skin cells and white heads. Yeah, not so much.I wish products would do what they promise to do. Disappointing."
4,Pretty good,"I think this mask is good overall. It hurts a little when you try to peel it off, but it does pull out some impurities. The only downside with this is that it's really difficult to spread a thick, even layer on your face as directed on the package. It is not a big tube, and you need a lot to do so...Therefore, I don't think its gonna last very long. Overall, it does its job very well."
3,"Nice, but not special enough to warrant this price tag","Definite funk factor here: it goes on pure black and you slather it on thick. As far as peel-off masks, it actually does peel off in one or a few pieces. My skin was felt smooth and normal when I took it off--no tightness. I'm 43 with combination skin and live in a humid climate. Again, a nice product, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. My favorite mask is Body Shop's Self-Heating mask. Super groovy and my skin looks fab for the rest of the day."
1,wack,"Doesn't do anything. Used it faithfully as instructed. I still have blackheads. waste of $. I moved on to sephora brands. still haven't found ""the one"""
5,Tasty and inexpensive,I'm able to find this tea at my local Asian grocery store for $2.99 per box. What a deal and tea tastes great!
3,"ao far so good,","this is a pretty big box of tea, it takes a long time to drink all this, the tea is not great, but its not bad. if you like tea, this is a great jumbo box"
1,This not not Green Tea - Stay Away,This is black tea. This is not green tea. What a rip-off. Stay away from this tea. It is cheap for a reason. Really misleading advertisement - this tea is neither green nor caffeine free.Stick with Japanese green tea.Following are excellent green teahttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FNJ7SS/ref=oh_o00_s00_i02_detailshttp://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Matcha-Japanese-Leaves/dp/B000WB1YSE/ref=pd_bxgy_gro_text_bfollowed byhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TIYVPK/ref=wms_ohs_productFollowing is not bad but not as good as the abovehttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XUJ4BK/ref=wms_ohs_product
1,British Light Infantryman of the Seven Years War,"As a historical researcher and scholar I found this book to be very unnecessary and almost useless as to the research presented. It is more of a review of the 'Diary of Robert Kirk' than a dissertation of light infantry formation, tactics and weapontry. As to the colored plates...I have been to Nova Scotia and to Fortress Louibourg and it does not look at all like the plates, even considering time and place. The capture of Signal Hill was accomplished by Capt. Moses Hazen's Company of rangers and Highlanders from the 78th Fraser's HB. It seems that artistic license verses historical truth is the word for these picture plates. As to the information contained within this book, I could do much better at the local library. The rating is actually too high, 1/2 star maybe."
5,Take no Prisoners,It is a shame that this group isn't still producing music. They are refreshing and inspirational to my young violinists!
5,Gerard - A Great Way To Discover This Band,"If you have ever wanted to explore this band, this is the album to pick up. Although their studio albums are good, live is where this band really lets their incredible chops speak for themselves. Like Emerson Lake And Palmer on speed, Gerard throw down the gauntlet producing incredible keyboard, bass and percussion interplay with pulse racing energy. Although there is no guitarist in the band, many of the keyboard sounds used come across as very guitar like. This is a seriously heavy bombastic album. Fans of progressive rock, especially those who like serious keyboards should eat this up. Along with Ars Nova, Gerard is one of the best prog rock trios to come out of Japan in the last decade and this album is a tribute to their incredible talent."
5,straight forward easy to understand,A clear and plain explaination of how vaccines work the disease they prevent and the risks/benfits of vaccines
1,What You SHOULD Know but STILL don't.,"Apparently parents are supposed to be able to sleep better at night becausea medical doctor, who is a patent holder on childhood vaccines and a vaccinemanufacturer consultant, has pronounced that vaccine additives, like mercuryand aluminum, are perfectly ""safe."" The scientifically illogical premise,for example, that aluminum has been proven safe because it has been injectedinto hundreds of millions of people for the past 70 years, is just oneexample of how shallow this doctor's arguments are in the face of hundredsof millions of chronically ill children and adults around the world who havereceived these vaccines.(www.nvic.org)"
1,Lining Offit's Pockets,"If you want to know what you should know about vaccines, don't buy this book. Paul Offit has stood against ""informed consent"" many times insisting that sometimes it is better for parents NOT to know about what actually goes into vaccines, including mercury, aluminum, aborted foetal tissues, components derived from crab blood, etc. Paul Offit also has stood up against due process for folks who have sustained vaccine injuries. Good heavens! If Merck is found liable for vaccine injuries, good ole Paul could lose money...If you want to know what Merck wants you to know about vaccines, buy this book..."
4,Monroe Max Air Shocks,"These appear to be good quality shocks and were relitively easy to install. The hose supplied was long enough to accomodate any installation needs. Theonly fault I have with the kit is that the Schrader valve assembly for pressurizing the shocks is not long enough to be mounted thru a wall thickness more than about 3/16"" thk. The fiberglass trunk wall in my car had to be counterbored to allow fitting of the Schrader valve."
1,Monroe MA785 Max-Air Adjustable Shocks,Monroe MA785 Max-Air Adjustable ShocksThe worst product packaging ever. The product I received does not match that shown in the photo. And included absolutely no instruction or paperwork indicating what it what the at I received.
3,Parts have not been received,"Sirs, the address I have given for delivery has not rceived the parts,could you advise of their where abouts please.I am eager to have the parts here in Australia.Can you please discuss?Regardscolin Jenkins"
3,A Lukewarm Reaction,"As a fairly serious student of John and Caitlin Matthews many works, I must say I was rather disappointed by this latest one. As has been previously stated, the material has already been covered in his three volume series of sourcebooks. Besides that, the material is, in my opinion, poorly arranged and incredibly dull. Add to this the fact that many of the sources are questionable in both authenticity and scholarly value, and you have a poor book from an otherwise outstanding author. If you have need of an impressive looking reference book, then by all means pick this book up. If you're looking for an exciting read on the Druids, this is not it."
1,Greatly disapointing,"What a waste of money, If you read the Matthews work seriously you'll already have the three books that this book is pulled from.If you don't read their work seriously the book is disjointed and dry.Sadly the newest thing about the book itself is a nice cover and a few new drawing that look great. The drawing are repeated in the book wasting space,and the cover is destroyed when you try to take the shrink-wrap off that it ships in. I can understand the reason for the shrink wrap, if I saw this book in a store I would never of bought it. With the wrapping you can be fooled into thinking this is a new piece of work.I would strongly suggest spending money on either the three book set the Matthews have done, (Sourcebooks for Druids, Seers, and Bards) or buying a more ""user-friendly"" book on the basics. In either case don't waste the money on this watered down version."
4,The Man Who Came Back,Very violent film but there is a very clear line between good and evil evident in the characters. Keeps your attention and gives you strong reasons to root for the good guys. Reminds me of early Clint Eastwood man with no name westerns.
1,Lame as they get,"A cheaply written plot that plays on the viewers nerves. We've seen it all before in greater films such as ""Roots."" The lead guy was way too old and slow, not much of a hero. Also the mean spirited scenes made the movie a complete wash-out for me. I Kept looking at my clock to see when this torture would end.Not a good western or a good movie. Trash."
2,Soap opera star - soap opera production quality,"Maybe Eric Braeden is just sticking with what's familiar to him, but the acting, sets, and production quality were straight off a soap opera set. Fix those, and it could have been a 4-star rated movie. As it is, the list of acting credits just lets you know who must have been REALLY hard up for a paycheck in 2008."
5,STRONG WESTERN STORY,"THIS FILM WAS EXCELLENT IN ACTING, STORY CONTENT AND ACTION. I AM SURPRISED THAT IT WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD. ERIC VON BRADEN DID A MAGNIFICENT JOB OF BRINGING THIS MOVIE TO COMPLETION. I AM GLAD I BOUGHT THIS DVD AND ADDED IT TO MY COLLECTION OF FILMS. COWBOY DON"
1,Junk,"I can't understand how anyone can watch this and actually think it was a good movie. All the reviewers who rated this movie negatively are spot on with their criticisms. Perhaps Young and the Restless fans just can't get enough of ""Victor"". At any rate, don't waste your time.Shot with a video camera.Southern not a Western.Two dimensional characters.He is too old for the role.Most of all a predictable story and as for the scene where his family is killed, it just made me uncomfortable to watch. The acting lacks any real emotion, i.e. contrived."
5,Yesterday's Dreams,"Todd Anthony is a newcomer to the recording scene, but his debut cd shows the heart, and skills, of a seasoned veteran. The cd is a varied mix of styles, and tempos. From the Spanish flavored ""Vuelve Mi Amor"", to the country rock ""Things Here Are Different"", to the haunting ballad ""One Night In Reno"", to the Moog driven rocker ""Yesterday's Dreams"",to the touching ""Hey TJ"". Todd has covered several different genres of mucic successfully. Mr.Anthony opens up his heart and soul, and invites the listener inside. Todd has a voice and style all his own, reminding you of several artists, but no one in particular. From the performances, to the production, to the packaging, ""Yesterday's Dreams"" is a well crafted piece of work, a nice addition to your cd collection. Do yourself a favor... get this cd."
2,Outdated and dangerous to your bottom line.,"This ebook describes the eBay of yesteryear. Today, when it comes to pricing your items, this ebook's mandate to start every auction at $.99 or less is a prescription for disaster. It's a buyers market on eBay and unless you know the demand for your item you may well be giving it away. That might be fine if you're just clearing out the closet but not if your buying merchandise to resell.There's some good basic info in here but nothing you couldn't find at eBay and its many forums for free.If your going to buy and resell product on eBay skip this book and read ""eBay Strategies : 10 Proven Methods to Maximize Your eBay Business"" buy Scott Wingo. It explains what sells and what doesn't sell well on eBay."
4,Good Book,I bought this book recently because I had had some success selling on ebay. The book had great suggestions and strategies on how to list you auctions and get top dollar for them. It's a must for the beginner ebay seller.
5,Novices and Experts alike NEED this!,"Wow, I just read it and it helps me alot! I was doing something wrong all this time and I am sure it cost me a lot of money. This book will make you think ""I should have done that"" and ""Why didn't I think of this before!""It has DEFINATELY made a difference on how I list my auctions on Ebay.It's really worth the money..."
3,Overall Good Read,"I have overcome my apprehension of buying e-book (yes, this is my first time) by purchasing this one. Wu-haa!Author gives some basic ""secrets"" of selling stuff on eBay. These secrets are useful for newbies, but for seasoned eBay players, they probably have learned these through experience (like the author).All in all, it was a good read and I recommend this e-book to anyone who is new to eBay and similar online auctions. It is better to read this book and fast-track your learning than to experience all of the mentioned mistakes yourself.Also worth noting is that, the method explained in this book might only work on an auction site with big audience (I supposed that's why the author put ""eBay"" in the title). If you use this method at sites with small audience, you could land yourself in trouble of not getting enough number of bids.I give only 3 stars because I thought this 67-page e-book is a little pricy and tips explained are for beginners."
2,Doesn't really work....,"I think it depends on what you are selling. If your item is really popular like an Apple ipod or a designer handbag, then it would work. If it isn't, you will simply get less money.I tried the methods several times. I got plenty of bids, hits and watchers but I ended up getting less money than my competitors because people were bidding in small increments.I also found that those with hundreds and thousands of feedback were getting better prices for their items.More bids does not always mean more money. :-("
3,I'm not sure if it is current,"The author claims that if you start the bid at $.99 with no reserve, that no matter what the item is, that you'll get more for it than you thought you'd get for it.i don't know if that's true. I've seen many auctions on eBay where the seller got ripped off because only one person bid on an item, and the bid was for $.99.While years ago the author sold his Viper using the suggestions in his book and made a profit on it, I don't think that in today's market that would happen. Even with his suggestions, things don't work that way anymore, at least from what I've seen happening.It isn't a bad ebook. The suggestions are pretty good if you're auctioning stuff that isn't expensive and you could afford to lose money on. However, if it is something that really is valuable, you shouldn't necessarily count on selling it for what it is worth if you follow his suggestions."
3,Watch the competition...,"Some of the advice in this short book is on the mark and worth the modest price. Other points may work only in certain selling categories; the best gauge is what the sellers in that category that get the best prices are doing.For example, the author is correct that providing photos and getting the right title are critical. Sometimes the description of an item leaves a lot unsaid, but the item still gets a good price because of the photos.Other advice I don't believe is applicable to all categories, particularly not using HTML.Consumer electronics is one area where sellers that seem to get the highest prices have pretty slick presentations, usually with lots of HTML which the author derides. I wouldn't want to try to compete there without the same. Even in collectibles I've seen presentations dressed up with HTML outperform the competition.All in all, the book is OK for the money."
4,"Quick, Consice, and Helpful","This book is great for a handful of helpful tips for a casual eBay seller that is interested in having a starting point to growing his/her eBay earned income. It's a quick, to the point, and casual reading. Look at it this way, the ROI from the $10 investment will be returned from using just one of the helpful tips in just one transaction most likely."
1,This book is fine IF...,"...you're looking for good advice for selling a few items on eBay. It has very good advice for maximizing your bids, writing your ad, etc. However, if you're looking for something to guide you in starting an ongoing eBay business at a high level, this is not the choice to make. In addition, if you are already using eBay to run your ""virtual garage sales"", you're not going to find much here that you don't already know. So I suppose my 1 star rating is based as much on my expectations and goals as it is the book itself."
1,Newbies Only Book - waste of my money,"I have been a buyer/seller on ebay and other auction sites for 7 years. This was definitely a waste of my money. This book may be helpful for newbies but most of the info in this book can be found on the discussion boards/forums. I don't agree with some of the tips the author was discussing. Ebay has become very competitive and a lot of the buyers who are regular visitors have become very savvy. Don't sell these buyers short. If I followed the author's ""tips,"" I would be losing a large amount of money."
5,"A solid, basic scale","Since I purchased this scale, the price has gone up. At the lower price, it was a great value. But, even at the higher price, it is a good, stylish scale that goes well with any decor. When I bought this scale, I was looking for a model that uses 0.2 increments, which this has. Most of the other models only have 0.5 increments. Most important, the results are repeatable. (Beware! If you don't follow the directions, you'll get an error message.)"
2,Stopped Working,"I bought two scales. One quit working only after a dozen or so uses. While the scale looks nice, and the readout is easy to use, reliability is also very important."
4,Great toy with One Major Flaw,"Maybe smaller children, say under the age of 15 months, will not notice this. But when your child is around 16 months and older - they will inevitably find the power switch. My son turns the toy to annoying Spanish mode and off and on. I'm glad he knows how to do this ... But still. Leap Frog should have put the on/off switch on the back of the toy like every other toy maker out there does and save us just a little bit of grief.I really hate the fact that toy makers must make toys so loud for delicate baby ears. But, they do and nobody stops them."
3,A nice to have toy for toddlers,My kid loves it and tries to sing along with it. The toy works great.Only drawback is it has only few learning programs compared to other equally priced toys.I would though recommend this toy. No flaws at all
5,7 month old loves this toy,"We received the Leap Frog Learn and Groove Musical Table for x-mas when my son was 6 months old. We kept the legs off and placed it on the floor and he instantly loved it. It was recommended to me by a friend with a 7 month old and 2 year old and she was right on the money. We put the legs on it when he was 7 months, and he loves to try standing while leaning against it, flipping the book back and forth. He is attracted to all of the buttons, doors, keyboard, trumbone, etc. All of the different noises entertain and amuse him. It's insta-fun!I highly recommend this toy!"
4,"Great, except...","I found this product to be surprisingly educational and attention-holding for my 10 month old. The only negative is that the table/legs are not sturdy. My child is constantly leaning up against it (rightfully so) and sliding it across the floor and crashing into things or will occasionally lose his balance and fall. Perhaps if the legs could have some texture to the bottos so that the table can ""grab"" onto the carpet, etc."
4,"Slips and Slides, but she loves it.","The good part is that my little one loves this toy. She is very drawn to it. The bad part is that she needs support when standing or pulling up, and this thing slides across the floor, having no ""grip"" on the feet of the legs, causing falls if I'm not right there holding her or bracing the toy."
3,Good Quality Sound and materials,"This is quality materials and the sound is better than most toys. We bought this because our 8.5 month old is pulling herself up on things now to stand, so we figured this would be a good reward for pulling herself up. However the table is not very sturdy, even a 15 lb. 8 month old can pull it down on her while trying to pull herself up.I would suggest leaving the legs off the table until your child can stand up without pulling on something. It simply wasn't made for that."
5,Didn't make it to Christmas...,"The Product was a easy setup, a five year old did it. The One year old is standing and playing with it. He plays with it every day! Not to much more to say than it didn't make it till Christmas, but worth opening now."
4,Table legs do not come off!,"I bought this toy for my 6-month old little girl, thinking that the legs were removable and she could play while she sat at it, but unfortunately, I have to hold her up everytime since she's not pulling up to a standing position on her own. The legs are NOT removable from the table. She loves playing when I'm holding her, but I would not recommend this toy for babies unless they can pull up to a standing position on their own."
5,Great Table,"This was a gift for my 7 mo grandson. He loves to play with it. Only problem is that when he pulls himself & walks around, it scoots some."
3,"It's ok, just not super excited about it.",This was a Christmas gift for my 1 year old. She's played with it a bit but she's not in love with it and I'm not sure why. It may not be her thing or it may be that she has other toys she likes better. My 3 year old is also luke-warm about it.
2,Wonderful toy but unfortunately mine was defective,"We bought this for my 8 month old and within 3 weeks it wouldn't work. There is a video review on here at 1 star that shows exactly what ours ended up doing. We can only guess that the page was the weak point as that is where the problems started. I know some people have great luck with this toy but unfortunately we did not. On the plus side, baby absolutely adored it! Even my 8 year old played with it quite a bit and learned the Spanish colors. If this were durable it would be one of those toys that I would recommend to everyone but it seems that is not to be."
3,"Great toy for babies who love music, but durability is an issue.","This toy has been great for our baby. He LOVES making music with this table. Unfortunately, less than a month of use has the unit doing strange things. It's as if the music gets stuck in a loop, playing one seconds worth of music over and over until you fidget with some of the buttons."
3,Take stickers off!,This is a much cheaper toy than the original and more cheaply made as well. My kids love it but make sure you remove the two stickers of the frogs. They were coming off right out of the box...definitely a choking hazard :(
4,Slides,"I like this toy for my 10 month old crawler, but it slides around on the floor, so for her to be able to pull-up on it it has to be against the wall or a piece of furniture. I gave it four stars due to this, but overall she really likes it and the spanish setting is good."
5,Music table,"My baby is very much happy with this product. She plays with it most of the time.. I would definetly recommend this for babies aged 6 months to 1 year, when they are trying to hold things and stand.great toy.."
5,GREAT toy for my disabled child.,"My youngest child (turning 1 soon) received this as a gift for Christmas from my parents, per my request. My husband scoffed at it and saw it as just another toy to take up space. However, I felt my daughter, who is physically disabled due to brain damage from a knot in her cord, could really benefit from it. I was right! She LOVES this toy and is really motivated by it. She loves trying to hit the buttons, the lights and sounds often catch her attention, and I LOVE how I can put it and her into many different positions for all sorts of therapeutic play. I love that it has a ""page"" that baby can turn that will change the mode from music to learning letters, colors, shapes and numbers. My 2 and 4 year old love it, too!"
4,This is awesome with one flaw,Only one prob... There is a little cubby area that the door falls off and gets lost. I know lots of people with this toy but that piece is always gone! Otherwise the kids are crazy for it!
2,Flimsy,We bought this for our 10 month old who is learning to pull up. We thought this would be a good toy to learn on but as soon as she grabs onto the top it tips over on top of her. Once she is standing she seems to enjoy the toy. I wouldn't recommend it unless the child is already standing on their own.
1,Detachable legs don't detach,"The table itself is great, but I put the legs on it so my toddler could play with it and then went to take them off so the baby could play with it, only to find they don't detach as advertised. Upon contacting ""customer service"" I was told it was their mistake and that I could take it back to the store or they would send me a return label and a new one. I don't have the box or receipt so I can't take it back to the store and I don't have a box big enough to return it to them since it's quite large with the legs attached. I am amazed by the lack of service seeing as this is their problem. Just be sure yours is one that really has detachable legs before you throw the receipt and box away! Way to go, Leap Frog!"
3,The legs are not detachable,"Don't be fooled! You can use this on the floor or up on its legs. But once you put the legs on they do not come off. I contacted LeapFrog and they said they are modifying the packaging to indicate this. I had planned to return it but with the legs on it would require a large box and was just more of a hassle than I bargained for. So I kept it but was sorely disappointed. Had I known this I would have bought something else, or at least waited until my grandbaby was able to stand before I put the legs on. Either way, I can't remove them. A search of the net resulted in some directions on how to remove the legs but I felt like I was going to break them."
3,"Good toy, LEGS NO LONGER COME OFF","Great toy, but beware the legs do not come off. the new version in stores now has a new design according to customer service at leap frog and once you put them on (snap them into place) they can NEVER be removed. My 6 month old now cant play with this toy unless we hold him in a standing position. really annoying. we are returning. leap frog said the just have not gotten around to updating the box."
5,it's a must!,"I purchased this from Amazon for my son when he was 4 months old based on the excellent reviews.He was not quite ready to use it but showed some interests when I showed him how to play.His interaction has been improved a lot since then and now it became his favorite toy.He controls the keys, loves the musics, and toddle around the table.It's a must!"
2,Too light; Broke in a few weeks,"I bought this toy for my son after he began cruising around on furniture. When I first put it together I was surprised at how light it was. My 9 month old son could easily push it over and frequently pushes it around the house. I really wish the legs had more weight to them to keep it sturdy. The toy itself is very engaging and my son plays with it frequently. However after a few weeks of playing the sound and lights would get stuck, creating a thumping sound that doesn't stop until I turn it off and back on again. It's really frustrating to have to constantly fix it and my son gets disinterested quickly when it gets stuck. For the price I think it should be much more durable than it is."
2,"Great Idea, but needs work","I bought this based on other reviews and others that had the older version. I don't know what the older version was like, but one thing I really do not like about this is that it is so incredibly light, that my son has been pulling it on top of himself while trying to use it as leverage to stand up ever since he was about 7 months old. Also, it's so light that when he's standing playing with it, it scoots across the carpet and he ends up falling. The idea is a good one, but it seems too cheaply made. A bit of sand weights in the legs would've taken this toy from average/needs work to pretty great. It's a baby's toy. It's for babies that are learning to stand. It should be designed to not fall on top of them when they use it to stand up and should be designed to stay steady when they play with it. It's disappointing. I had high hopes for it, but someone either got lazy or the person that designed this never had kids."
1,Toy breaks within weeks,"My 9 month old twin boys LOVED this toy. The problem is that the electronics keep breaking. The first time it broke Amazon generously sent a replacement despite the fact that I hadn't saved the original packaging. Now 6 weeks later the replacement is broken. The toy makes a horrible skipping noise whenever anything is pressed on it. In fact, even when no one is touching it it starts making horrible noises. Granted, twins are going to be harder on a toy than a singleton, but still! A baby toy should be durable enough to withstand abuse by babies, no?"
5,Excellent table choice,"Our close friends bought this for their daughter (8 months old) but our 2 year old son loves playing with it too!It is very durable and the batteries last a long time. As a parent, I love that it doesn't get annoying (you know what I mean) and teaches the user songs and things that aren't on every other toy. There are lots of buttons to push, things to open and close, and things to turn and crank.This would be an excellent table for your standing baby!"
3,The first one shipped the sound didn't work.,The first one amazon shipped me didn't work. The lights work but no sound. After getting a replacement the sound does work now.I think its a little loud even on the lowest setting. My boy is 12 months old and he doesn't seem that crazy about it. I will see how it goes in a few weeks and update this review.
5,Leap Frog Learn and Groove,"This table is very much like the Leapfrog Learning Table. I bought them both thinking they were different, but they are the same. Either table is good, but don't get both unless you have twins."
5,Baby's Favorite Toy,"I have to say my 8-month daughter plays with this table everday. We bought it when she was 6-months and used it to pull herself up. Now she plays with all the buttons, flips the book in the middle, chews on a little and even plays with the on/off button (but she doesn't know what it does). This toy is worth the money and, based on other reviews, it will be used for many months to come! Great toy to keep them occupied for a while."
1,Legges are not detachable as the instruction claimed to be. Do not buy. Mis-leading instruction and picture on the package,Legges are not detachable as the instruction claimed to be. Do not buy. Mis-leading instruction and picture on the package.
3,Great Toy,"This is great toy. My kid likes it very much. I found one two issues though.1) Once its legs are put its very difficult to figure out how to pull them back for traveling purpose. The instruction manual does not talk about this.2) Its very light weighted. Problem with it is that while playing with it, it fall on my kid many times. This can result in some injury so we have to be very careful."
4,Loads of fun for your little one.,"This little toy is great. I think it could be used from infant in the crib as a toy clear to being an activity table for your toddler/preschool age child. I especially like that it converts to a little table with the blocks as well as just a table alone. The activities have nice lights and sounds. Plenty of interesting things to keep your little one occupied. The only thing that I didn't like is that it slides around easily on the hardwood floors. Maybe some kind of skid proof bottom would be a good idea. It even slides a bit on the carpeting. Other than that, I love it and so does my grandson!"
5,awesome toy!!!,My 9 month old is surgically attached to this piano. he will not move from this piano even for a second. He absolutely loooooooooves it!!!. Plus its very educative.I wud highly recommend this toy.
1,DIdn't last a month.,It looks like a great product. I bought this toy for my 8 months old son. I didn't last month when it started making weird noises and not playing any music.
4,good product,Bought it as a gift for my neice's 1st birthday. Very useful toy. She is enjoying it a lot. Very pleased to have bought it
5,Great for learning and standing!,My 7 month old LOVES this table. She has learned to balance her weight while playing and really enjoys the music and sounds the table makes. It's not terribly annoying for Mom and Dad either. If you have a little one who loves to stand or is trying to...this is for you!
4,My four month old loves it,I put my baby in the bumbo and take off two legs lean it forward and he loves it.Update- nearly four years laterMy son will still occasionally play with thisStill works great and ready for second child on the way.
4,Keeps my 10-month old entertained,"This table is sturdy, my bigger-than-average 11 month old pulls herself up on it and has fun grooving along with the music. Lots of different sounds and things to do. I wish it had more volume control options, but that's really my only complaint. The music is actually pretty nice, with piano arrangements and string instruments. Good quality sound, and not as annoying as most music toys for baby."
5,Fun for baby Zoe,This is an excellent product. My 6 month old daughter normally expects and demands a bottle 1st thing in the morning but Christmas morning we showed her this and it immediately caughter her attention. It is fab that you can take the legs off of it for little little ones to play with on the floor. She will sit or lay on her tummy and play with this. This is something I would recommend to anyone looking for a play table like this!
5,8 month old loves it,"The music is not irritating, which I appreciate. My 8 month old loves all of the songs and lights. It's easy for him to press and move the buttons."
2,"Fun toy, breaks too quickly","I had seen this toy at a friends house and my daughter went crazy over it. I knew we had to buy it. Then we saw it was almost $50 at the store. We bought it anyway and crossed our fingers. Success! This toy helped her pull herself up and learn how to stand more steadily. She has now had it for over six months and still plays with it weekly. Putting Cheerios or Puffs in the container area is a hit, too! She is always checking under that blue lid.**Update- I changed my high star ratings lower. This toy only lasted about five months and even with new batteries, it would not work right. This isn't the only one with this problem. Another friend of mine found that theirs did the same thing. Sad."
5,Great fun!,"We received this as a gift before my son was even born. I couldn't wait to break it out and play with it myself. I really like that the legs are removable. When he started sitting on his own, I put two of the legs on and he loved it like that. Once he started crawling, I put the other two legs on it to encourage him to pull up. Now that he's pulling up and ""cruising"" he pushes it all over the house, like a walker or something. I admit, it started to ""spaz out"" a couple of times, but I just changed the batteries and that fixed it! The switches (volume/power and English/Spanish) could be a little stiffer, my son is constantly switching them. But I even have fun with this toy. The sounds are great, the voice is pleasant and I love the colors!"
4,9 month old son really likes his LeapFrog table,Can be used with or without the legs but by the time I purchased the table my son was already pulling up and standing so we just keep the legs on except for when transporting. Legs are stable and detach easily if wanted. My son is now cruising and he makes his way around the table flipping things and hitting buttons. He especially likes flipping the center book back and forth between learning and music mode. He even likes crawling under the table and pushing it across the floor with his head while crawling lol. I think he will use it for a little while longer. All in all I think it was a good purchase.
5,great table,My 9 month old loves it; she plays with it daily and seems to find new things on it everyday
5,My daughter loves it!,"My daughter learnt it very quickly. She can play the music and wave her hands. After the music finishes, she always applauds for her owne performance. Btw, she's 11-month old."
4,Good purchase!,Our granddaughter likes this table. We went on a road trip and took it along. Great for the trip. Lightweight and packs easily.
3,"Better than most, but Spanish alphabet is wrong","I want to bring your attention to a major flaw in this product. The alphabet, when in Spanish mode, is incomplete. I would understand if the English alphabet was just translated into Spanish. That would mean our 26 letter alphabet would be translated into 26 Spanish letters. That did not happen.I would also understand if this mode sang the Spanish alphabet, resulting in 30 letters (the addition of Ch, Ll, N~, Rr).However, this product sings 27 letters. It omits the Ch, Ll, and Rr characters.I am positive that non-Spanish speakers would not notice these omissions, resulting in many parents not knowing their children were not learning the proper Spanish alphabet.This is a major flaw in the toy, which is touted as a learning tool. I have also noticed this flaw on a couple other manufacturers activity tables."
3,My baby can only play with it for a while,"My baby gets tired of this toy after 5-10 minutes. Its nice and does cute things but some of the music is kind of lame. I put the legs because he likes to stand up now but the legs are so flimspy and one time it flipped over and he fell and the toy smashed his face (he cried of course). It's an alright toy, its not all bad, but I'd rather just buy it used next time for the price."
2,Awesome toy...until it breaks.,"We bought this for our son when he was starting to stand up and lean on things, he LOVED it especially the musical aspect of it. I would have rated this much higher if not for the fact that only after 9 months of use, it is broken. Every single button jams and makes an annoying high pitched drumming sound. And the LeapFrog products are only covered under warranty for up to 3 months. If you get it I would suggest buying an additional warranty from babies r us or something because it will probably break after regular use."
2,didn't last long,"this product has great reviews, and yes, this toy can be fun for a while. i bought this for my daughter before she was walking and she seemed to enjoy it. i noticed not long after playing with it each time, she would be bored and find something else to do. there is only one page in the 'book,' so that part wasn't too engaging. it has now been almost four months, and the musical part of the toy has died. the lights still blink when you press the buttons, but there is no music that comes out, and there is no place to open it up to check or fix it. i wish i could have lasted at least a few months longer. oh well."
2,maybe baby needs to be older - (not good for 6 months),"Maybe I will be able to give this a higher review once my baby is older. Right now, at 6 months, this toy is not fun. Even though baby can sit, she can't reach any of the fun things on the toy because she can't reach them. If she is sitting and reaches as far as she can she still can't get to the things. This just leads to a frustrated baby so we have out this away in the hopes that it will be fun later...."
5,My honest opinion,"My daughter started playing with this table at 8 months. It gave her an opportunity to stand and play. Initially, she played with it for over an hour daily. Now that the novelty has worn off, she still plays with it at least 4 times a week for a few minutes here and there. I think the table has not only entertained her, it challenged her fine motor skills. Overall, it was a great investment for her."
3,Good features but flimsy table legs,"Cons:The construction is terrible. The legs are too light weight and there is nothing to keep them from sliding across the floor. Its a bit of a safety hazard for a pre/new walkerPros:The table top features are great and I can see baby using this for an extended period. It was easy to put together, just snapped on the 4 legs and inserted batteries."
5,"First Christmas, first present and most liked","We overbought our 11 month old son on toys for his first christmas and this thusfar has been the one he is playing with the most. he walks around it in circles, playing with everything that makes a sound. We are very glad we bought this."
5,Fantastic Gift !,Easy to assemble with lots of fun and entertainment for all. Two year old and parents Loved this musical table !!
4,Fun toy,"This music table has a variety of activities. It's not our son's favorite toy, but he'll stand and play for a few minutes at a time. Cute songs and features."
4,It's okay!,"My son got this as a gift. The first day he was very interested, then after a couple of days he started throwing it upside down. Now he's trying to climb on top of it. But I find the music soo annoying and the voice!"
5,Educational and Fun!!!,My baby is only eleven months but he has been walking for about a month now. So we needed a toy that could keep him entertained for at least a few minutes to give us a rest. I love this musical table as much as he does. The bilingual feature is just a plus since I wanted my baby to learn both lenguages at the same time. It is a little unstable in hardfloors so we keep it in this carpeted room.
5,"Good toy, better than expected","I went and bought this week after reading the reviews from Amazon. I was reading the review about how the legs couldn't be detach once connected and also the alphabet didn't go all the way from A-Z. However, those reviews were not correct. I was able to detach the legs. It seems like Leapfrog fix the issue by having a lever to detach the legs so you could attach/detach them when you need it. I also tested the sound and the alphabet was going all the way from A-Z.My daughter is 8 months and she loves playing it so far."
3,"Kids Love It, But It Breaks Easily","This toy is very good at getting my twins attention and keeping it and it does help to get them to standup on their own, cruise, etc. This is a good addition to the nursery or play room once an infant begins to sit up and stand up on their own. Its an especially nice toy for multiples because more than one can play with it at a time.Unfortunately, this is not a very durable toy. The sound broke on our first one within a 3 weeks and the replacement (which Amazon shipped immediately and for free) is now showing signs of the sound going out again after about 2 months. The sound is a recurrent issue with other reviewers and I can confirm that it not only gets ""stuck"" but also that it eventually goes out and only the lights work.I don't think the Learn and Groove is a waste of money, but for the money I would expect it to last longer and be more durable."
5,Fantastic toy!!,"Wonderful toy!! It encourages fine and gross motor skills. My son loves to stand, walk around and dance while learning basic concepts, his ABC's and numbers!!!"
5,long lasting entertainment for babies,"I purchased this table for our twin's 1st birthday. We've had it for about 2 months now, and they are still interested in it on a daily basis. I'm not sure if I believe that toys like this contain educational value, but they sure provide entertainment. It's not really an annoying toy to listen to either, which is nice for the parents.The nicest features of this table are the removable legs, and the music setting, The removable legs were great for us because our kids were at different levels developmentally so each could use the table. I would either remove two legs, and set the table on its side, within reach of my son unable to stand up to it, or remove all and let him play with it sitting up. The music setting is great, lots of cool sounds that the kids just love. One of the best toys we've purchased."
5,Son loves to bang on it while its on the floor,My son can't stand yet but he loves to bang on it while its on the floor. I can't wait until he can stand and press the buttons. GREAT buy :)
5,My baby's favorite toy!,My 12 month old baby got this from his grandma when he was 8 months oldand he loves it! It's super well made and fun for them. I just wanted to give this 5 stars!
5,So very pleased with our purchase,"Gave to our grandson and he was all smiles. While he is still very young, he will have many months of play. The beauty of this gift, is it can change as he grows."
5,Great buy!,"This was a great buy! My daughter loves it! The only complaint i have is that the legs are a bit wobbly...so....just keep an eye on it. Other than that, I am happy with this purchase."
3,Not As Impressed,"We are not as impressed with this item. If your child gets bored with tv, they might get bored with this table. There is alot going on with this item but our daughter gets bored with it easy. She preffers her cube that has several activities on it instead. Also, if the child is learning how to stand up on their own it will slide across the carpet and hard floor from being pushed on. Our daughter has flipped this while holding on to this table while standing and she flipped it the opposite direction on herself while trying to pull up on it. The legs come off pretty easy, it's great as a toy to sit down and play with. The little door breaks off fairly easy, it's not difficult to put back on, though. Our nephew who is 6 weeks older than our daughter and a pro at standing, crawling, cruising, ect. has no issues with this item flipping over. We'd reccomend this item for babies who have those milestones down extremely well. It's not worth more than $20 to us."
5,Great Product,"Baby loves it. Easy assembly, sturdy & very functional. Great toy for babies that are beginning to pull themselves up and stand."
4,Amazing product!,"Dear LeapFrog,I purchased this learning table for my grandson at the age of 8 months. I cannot believe how much he has enjoyed this table every weekend he visits. He has learned many motor skills from this table. The only downfall is that the center booklet on the table is ONLY one page. I've noticed how much he likes to flip the page once he got a hang of it! Bravo! LeapFrog for making this product available for my grandson!!! It was also a great price thru Amazon, except for the shipping cost! :-)"
5,Super toy for 6 months to 18 months,"As the pictures show, this toy can be used with no legs, two legs, or all four legs. This creates great versatility for milestones. In addition, there are multiple activities, so that your little one will be entertained and amused for a longer period of time (versus a lot of toys in this age range). Lastly, it's NOT annoying! Hats off for creating a baby toy I can listen to for long periods of time that doesn't suck the life out of me!"
5,Great table!,This table has provided untold hours of fun for my daughter. There are so many different songs and sounds so it does not drive mom or dad crazy while she plays with it. We love it!
4,Great Fun!,"We have had the table for about a month, and our nine-month-old son loves it. The only reason why I gave the table only three stars for durability is because it can easily be pushed across the floor especially if you have hardwood like we do. He has not been able to completely push it over yet; but it is a fear of mine."
5,Fun and educational toy.,"I bought this toy for my 10 month old baby girl and she plays with it everyday. She loves it and it teaches her ABC and 123. Although she can't talk yet, I heard her say ABC while the song was playing. Highly recommended."
4,educational toy,"this toy arrived in tip top condition. the packaging protected the item so well that I was very happy with it. The gift recipient is playing with it every day - and having so much fun - with the music and the ""book"" as well as the colors and shapes. This looks to be so very durable too1"
2,"Fun, but...","I was surprised how tiny the table was when it was delivered, which is fine, it was just surprising. My son loves it and it keeps him entertained and he quickly learned how to pull himself up and stand after getting it. My one problem with this toy is that it is very unstable. If the child is sitting and then grabs the table to stand, the table topples over onto the child. It is very light and not at all sturdy. The legs are very flimsy. I would rate 5 stars if the legs were more weighted or had a way to be secured to the floor."
2,A little disappointed,We had the toy for a little over a month and it started to act up. The sound would constantly repeat itself and we are in the process of trying to get a new one.
2,Short-circuiting after 3-months,I purchased it at christmas for my 8 month old boy. I say the interest in the table is good. Educational value is good also. But after 3 months of use - and no spills onto it - the sound and lights on some of the buttons and switches are not operating properly anymore.
3,a WARNING about the legs,"Printed on the box is the statment ""detach table legs to play on the floor"". But be forewarned that the legs are NOT detachable. Once attached, they are permanent. I attached the legs to see if my 7 1/2 month old could use it, but he only barely can stand so I wanted to take the legs back off so he could play on the floor and I can't. He likes it a lot and would like to play with it. I think the misleading statement should not be on the box. I also think a warning on the table itself or even in the instructions would be nice.It's a great table otherwise, but I am frustrated that I was misled and not warned."
3,Great toy but it hardly made it to the second child before malfunctioning,"My son loved this toy and it really reinforced a lot of things for him like counting. He used it from about 1-2 years of age. I loved how the legs were detachable for when baby isn't able to stand quite yet.....however, with regular use, I wasn't able to use it for my second child as it broke soon after removing it from storage. This was really disappointing because it was not a cheap toy and I think it's reasonable to expect it to last a lot longer than it did. This is why I gave it three stars, although we really did like this product overall."
5,Great toy,"My son starting playing with this toy at 6 months old (with the legs off), he is now 16 months and still loves it more than any other toy. He loves the music and often dances along. He enjoys all of the various knobs and levers and can play with it for 15-20 minutes. I highly recommend this toy to anyone."
1,BEWARE! Contains lead and bromine and other chemicals!,"My daughter received this for Christmas and LOVED It! I try to keep her safe from toxic toys so I looked it up at healthytoys.org and it was ranked the highest level for toxic chemicals. During testing lead, bromine and other toxic chemicals were found in many different locations on the product. I had been trying to get an answer from Leapfrog about many toys we received and they continually refused to answer whether fire retardants, BPA, and other chemicals are used in their toys. I am wary of companies who are evasive about these questions. You have to research to protect your childrenJennifer[...]"
1,Toxic chemicals,"Check this toy out before purchasing. Internet research revealed it is high in lead, bromine, arsenic. This may be a healthier choice:Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Fun with Friends Musical Table"
1,High toxicity level of bromine,"Beware! Although this is one of my grandchild's favorite toys, we are throwing it out. [...] and [...] just came out with info about it having a high toxicity level for Bromine, which is very dangerous. It should be recalled. I have written to Leap Frog about this, and you should do the same!"
5,A big hit!,"My 10-month-old son loves his musical table. Not only does it help him as he learns to stand, he's really interested in the variety of musical buttons and other ""gadgets"" on the table. We recently had a group of about 10 babies the same age over to play, and the Learn & Groove was the big hit -- they were all fascinated and entertained by this much longer than they were with other toys."
3,Warning - legs aren't removable,"We just purchased this table last week - our 10 month old triplets love it, and the music doesn't seem like it will get annoying after repeated use. However, be warned that the legs are NOT removable on this version (just confirmed from LeapFrog customer service) - wish I'd known that before we attached them, since our kids are not standing on their own yet (and the table height is too high for them to play at while sitting). So it's a great toy, as long as you know NOT to attach the legs until you're 100% ready to - otherwise, you're out of luck."
2,Beware of stepping stool use!,"I have this product for my child and my best friend also purchased it for her children. Although this product is great if you have children that are starting to pull up as it has great educational value, once children are walking it doesn't take them long to realize this product can be stood on to reach objects that were probably deliberatly put out of reach. Therefore, this product can't be used for long before it has to be taken away for safety reasons. Before this it was a great entertainer but I reccomend the learn-around playground by leapfrog instead. It has much of the same educational and musical features (and then some) and cannot be stood on."
1,Short-Lived Fun!,We bought this toy for our 9 month old granddaughter. She loved it. She could manipulate the levers and buttons very easily and enjoyed the music this produced. The only real problem is that the toy lasted for about 2 weeks. It stopped playing the music. The lights still flashed but it was entirely silent. I see that several other people had this same problem. I would not recommend this toy at all.
1,Don't buy.. Can't detach the legs once fitted,You can't remove the legs once attached. Many people have done the mistake and leapfrog haven't given a warning about the same.
2,A lot of fun while it lasted,"We gave this toy to our daughter when she was about 6 months. She always liked it very much. She loved it when she started to stand up. It might have been her favorite toy. However after 3 months, without any good reason, it stopped working properly: it got stuck in one of the musical sounds it makes in the beginning. Our daughter was very upset, but we had to trash this toy and I would not buy another one to last another 3 months."
3,its ok,"The toy is ok, it has plenty to offer, but our daughter got bored of it. We bought it so she had a stand up toy to play on, but by the time we got it togther, (we were lazy), she could already stand. She had some brief interest, but that was all...she didn't learn anything from it either, though it does sing and name shapes in english and spanish. I would buy it just for a child learning to stand, but not for any one older."
3,Not the most durable,Baby plays with table occasionally. The table itself hasn't been working properly since we bought it but unfortunately 4 month warranty period is over.
2,Far inferior to the Fisher Price version,"I own this table as well as the fisher-price Laugh and learn musical table and I can tell you from several months of experience that my 10 month old son prefers the Fisher Price toy every time. FP really got it right this time with how they built this table, the music is not annoying, the activities are enjoyable and the toy is well made and durable. The Leap Frog version has been a colossal disappointment. The music and songs are lame and my baby just has no interest in playing with this table. I put them side by side in his play room and he NEVER chooses the Leap Frog toy."
2,Great toy but legs DO NOT DETACH as advertised,My son loves his table and got great use of it.2 Major complaints though..1) Eats through batteries in a matter of days. I called and they said it is only designed to work for 8 hours on a set of batteries. Not good for a kid with a good attention span like my son. They do not recommend using rechargeables but we did anyway and they fit and worked great. So not too big of a deal in the long run.2) Big complaint now. My son is done with the table and we're pregnant with #2. Tried to take the legs off for storage and they DO NOT come off. So either I have to break the legs off so that child #2 can use it on the floor or wait until he or she can stand to be able to use it. The other option is to return it for a new table which also will not have detachable legs. Shipping is at my own expense of course! Very very ticked off right now.Love the table up until today!!
5,It gets used everyday,"This table has less annoying music than many, and my 11 month old daughter goes over to it at least once an hour and pushes buttons to make music. Two and 3 year old children seem fascinated with this also, and the ability to take the legs off and use a a toy for little crawlers make me glad that in a our low-toy household, we have this toy. We bought it used and find it in great shape."
2,"Marginally educational, somewhat annoying for the child","This table seems to have everything that would stimulate musical interest. I gave it to my grand daughter at 5 months old, now at 61/2 months she can stand next to it and manipulate the items. However, it is frustrating for her. The page flip produces different results at different times, so the feed back is not there or correct in my mind. And it starts playing without doing anything. I think if a child initiates, it should produce the same reaction. Buy the Baby Grand Piano by fisher price. It is much better. I bought that for my grandson, and he still plays with it at almost 2 years old. He loved it."
1,Stopped working after 4 months,"My son loved this toy when we first got it. Unfortunatly, the sound broke after a few months of use. We cannot return it and the warranty has expired"
1,BROKE WITHIN 6 MONTHS WITH LITTLE USE,"I bought this toy for my baby girl for Christmas. Just when she was getting interested in it, it stopped working. She had played with the it for maybe 2 hours total when it died. Come to find out there is only a 3 month warranty on this $45 toy. Ridiculous. Leapfrog is not willing to stand behind its products and consequently, I will not be purchasing anything else from them."
3,It's good for awhile,"Because of all the great reviews for this product, I purchased it for my child. (Amazon is by far the cheapest price for this product.) My 6 month old and 3 year old loved it in the beginning. They played with it for about 2 weeks. Now it gets played with from time to time (like any other toy). This one just takes up more space. I would recommend buying this toy with a friend (who has kids) and passing it back and forth between houses. It is not very interesting to kids after a month."
5,Great toy! But I need help with the Spanish...,"My little man really likes this table. He has had it for around 6 months, plays with it almost every day, and I've only had to change the batteries once. He loves to dance to the music.I need a little help, though. I can sing along with the spanish version of the alphabet song, right up until the end. It's driving me crazy! :) Can someone please supply the missing words for me? ""La cancion del A B C, (blah blah blah blah blah), cantanla tambien."" Gracias!!!!!"
4,Nice toy,Ok so i bought this in 2007 so this review is going off of memory only. I think it held up for about 6 months. fun music everything has an interaction and my suga wuga loved it. Problem was I had a slobby baby.....well atleast I think this was the problem. She would hover over this thing and play with it all the time all the while slobbing from all those little baby teeth breaking through. Needless to say one day we went to play with it and it didnt work. i do believe her baby slob might have seeped between the cracks and caused some electrical shortage of some sort. But it was fun while it lasted
3,My son isn't too fascinated...,My 10 month old son is not too fascinated with this toy but maybe he will like it later...Im hoping so
3,Overall a good toy,"We bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old. She LOVED the toy back then! She would stand up on it, and just play with it for what seemed liked forever. When she started to cruise around furniture and pull up on things, she also loved this table. She couldnt get enough of it.Now at 16 months, she rarely ever plays with it. I dont know if its because she has so many other toys or why.. but she isnt interested in it anymore. Really, she only used the table for about 6 months.. and once she started walking she was no longer interested in it.It is a very good toy, but I would recommend getting this toy for your child while he/she is young.. b/c when they get older like my daughter, they may not be so interested in it anymore. Its a fun toy though :)"
3,Good for pulling up on,This table is good for the little ones to pull up on. Once they get up it kinda slides along the carpet but for the most part it is pretty sturdy. I am not overly impressed with any of the Leap Frog toys. They are basic and kinda boring. They light up and sing annoying songs and that's about it. As for this table specificlly It is probably th best Leap Frog toy I have seen. I like that you can take the legs off and it will sit on the floor. This was wonderful when my son was not pulling up but my daughter was. Overall I like this toy and so do my 8 month olds.
4,Loads of fun!,My 11 month old son loves this table! He plays with it several times throughout the day and also walks around it while holding on. The only thing I would recommend is to put it on a carpeted surface as the table can slide if your child pushes hard enough on it. Other than that I highly recommend it!
4,Great toy!,"I got this for my 11 month old and he absolutely loved it at first. He loved to dance to the drum beat. However, he did become bored of it after a few days after discovering how everything worked on the table. He still plays with it on occasion. Great buy!"
3,The kids love it.,"I bought for my one year old. Both my 2 1/2 and one year old love it. But it's not all that durable, and I have my doubts on how long it will last. One good feature, it only took two minutes to assemble. No tools needed. It is very cute, but not one of Leap Frog's most impressive toys."
2,Grandson gives this toy 2 out of 5....,My grandson enjoys this toy for one reason. He can use it to hold onto when he stands. The activities are few and I don't even know why they bothered to put the large book in the middle since it only contains one page. The sound is unusual on it too. It's very grainy and low quality. I expected more from Leap Frog and so did Jeffrey.
1,"Junky, lightweight plastic - only for very small babies",We received this as a gift and promptly returned it. He had already encountered this toy at a friend's house and grew bored with it in a few minutes. I don't understand why it is so popular. It is made of junky plastic with garish colors. The sound quality is very poor. The book the occupies the center of the table is useless-- why one page? It is very lightweight and low to the ground so it is not strong enough to support my child's weight to help him learn to pull himself up and it is too low for him to practice standing. He could topple it over when he was 8 months.
1,table slides easily across the floor when little one stands with it,"I think my 9 month old would enjoy the toy itself, but we are returning it since the whole table moves easily when he pulls up on it - he can push it around our fully carpeted floor like a walker! I called Leap Frog to ask if we were missing any attachments for the legs, and apparently, this is just how it's made. They suggested I glue rubber strips to the feet but then of course, I can't return it. They claim no one else has had this problem, but honestly, he already fell once in the first few minutes I had it out of the box. He's very stable at standing, but can't be using something like this to stand next to if it will move with just the slightest pressure. I can't imagine how slippery this would be on a wood or tile floor."
2,not much to it...,"my daugher (1 year old) was bored with this after about an hour. she showed interest in this because it was new, but doesnt bother with it anymore.there is not much to it (meaning it does not do very much) and it takes about 5 minutes to do everything on it! i wouldnt recommend this (especially for the price) when there are alot of other alternative and similar toys that would be more fun at a comparable price.i have always liked and recommended leapfrog products, but this one is just plain boring. my daughter usually only goes over to it now to try to climb up on it, so i will most likely be removing the legs. i have a feeling that once the legs are gone and this is on the floor, it will get slid under the toybox and not be bothered with very often."
5,My Son loves it!,"My Son is so intrigued by this toy. He loves flipping the page of the book (There should be more pages) but when he flips it, the toy lights up and plays music. It holds his attention because hes so busy opening doors, pressing buttons and flipping knobs. Oh and it's not too annoying. I highly recommend it!"
3,musical table,"the table is as shown. good for allowing child to stand and play! my nephew and daughter played nicely ""together"" on this toy without getting in each others way! that was a very nice ""feature"". not my favorite toy, but still a good one."
3,LeapFrog learning Table,Bought this as a gift for 6 month old grandson. Tried it out to see how it worked. Looks like it will be good for him with many options of activities.
4,Great Toy just Topples Easily,My little one (9 months) loves this table. The only drawback is it tips over easily. He'll try to climb up to it or just hang on to it and they both topple over.
4,"Good, fun table","My son got this for his first birthday 1 1/2 years ago, and he still plays with it at times. It has kept him pretty well entertained overall. He loves to twist the ""banjo"" and dance to the music. As others have mentioned, it has varied music and responses, giving it a great replay value, and keeps parents minds from going insane. ;o) Can't wait to see how our 6 month old likes it."
5,great learning toy,"this a really nice learning toy, it could have more than two choices in the book but a really great toy"
5,My son loves it!,"I have to admit I got this for a steal. I got this at a garage sale and they lady didn't think it worked. I was able to buy it for a dollar. I figured it probably needed new batteries, but turned it on and it worked right away. My son was about 6-7 months old when I gave this to him and he loves it! It's still a huge hit for him and he's 11 months old now. This is still one of the few toys he plays with constantly."
5,My niece loves it,"This was a present for my niece's 1st birthday. She absolutely loves it. She likes to dance, so the music is great, but I also wanted something that was educational. It's great"
3,"So much fun, but watch the legs!","This musical table is really fun for little ones as young as 18 mths. BUT...The insides of the legs are very sharp and jagged. Our baby crawled under the table and cut himself on the inside of a leg. We had to tape the inside of each leg to cover the edges. Or just take the table off the legs completely.The table itself is bright, fun and has such a great variety of games. All my grandchildren loved it."
4,Great baby toy!,"I love this toy and my daughter has been playing with it daily since she was 4 months and she's now 11 months. The only negative comment I have is that the sounds and voices seem to get stuck sometimes, repeating the same noise/ words until I turn off, then on again, and even sometimes that doesn't help.Over all- great entertainment for your baby!"
4,Well worth the price,"I bought this for my 10 month old granddaughter, she loves it. I was at first concerned that there wasn't as many things for her to play with on the table as some of the other brands have . But there are, and it has been a lot of fun for her."
5,Excellent!,"My grandaughter who is now 8 months old loves this toy, she is just beginning to explore the different aspects that this toy presents. I bought it several months ago along with various other toys. This is one of her favorites! We love the idea that we can incorporate spanish into her learning experiences early in life so that she picks it up easily. Her Mom and I plan in home-schooling her so learning tools such as this one are quite helpful in teaching her what we want her to learn. Home schooling is quite an endeavor to take on but after lots of research we feel it is the best way to go in order to shape and create the path we want her to take. Godliness, honesty, insight and the ability to communicate are high on our list and this toy provides the beginning of her communication skills in learning the spanish language. Emersyn has a short attention span and is a little girl always on the go but she loves this one which entertains her longer than most toys do."
5,"She loves it, and it's not annoying!","Our 13-month old daughter loves this (she's had it for several months; a hand-me-down from a relative, whose daughter, now 5, loved it as well). There is a wide variety of music and sounds, and it's actually not annoying - the music clips are real music, even including some jazz-vocal 'skat'. There are two volume levels, and the legs attach and remove very quickly and easily for travel/etc. Very stable - our daughter was standing and working her way around it long before she could walk unassisted, and it's never tipped over. Also obviously very durable, since this on is on it's second kid.I heartily recommend it for anyone with a pre-toddler or toddler."
2,it broke after two months,"Our 10 month old daughter loved this musical table. It was great for standing practice (she's not walking yet but pulling herself up on everything). Unfortunately it doesn't work anymore and we didn't get a guarantee. We are very disappointed. Even with new batteries, it doesn't work. I feel ripped off but it doesn't seem there is any recourse without a guarantee or receipt. :("
1,Shoddy workmanship/lacking customer service,"After having this toy for less than a year, the audio failed to work; the lights did work. I replaced the batteries to no avail. I called customer ""service"" and they told me that after 90 days, there was nothing they could do. Ironically, they offered me a 15% coupon of another Leapfrog item. I would not waste my money on a brand like Leapfrog that can't even last for a reasonable period. I am disappointed that the product did not last and that Leapfrog would not replace or repair it."
5,2 year old nephew's babysitter,He loves it and it keeps him busy so his mom can do work around the house. Great gift for a toddler!
1,"Not impressed, we've had TWO tables break","Leapfrog has some sort of major mechanical fail with this table. We have had two completely fail on us. Both have had the identical issue, when my son pushes the buttons something shorts out and the table starts making a rapid fire machine gun noise. The lights go crazy also.Both times it happened after about a month of minimal use.I'm now waiting for a response from Amazon to see if they'll just refund us for the second table, as my patience isn't up for seeing if a third table will break (but my guess is yes, it will)."
5,You won't be disappointed!,I bought this for my son for Christmas (he was 6 months at the time). He loved trying to pull himself up on the table. He giggled for 5 minutes the first time he played. He is now starting to walk and uses it like a walker by scooching it across the floor. I love the versatility and different options for him. There is so much for them to use between the ABC/123 and music side. I am a elementary teacher and I wish all parents started their children off with such education toys. It is great introduction for little ones! Definitely a must:)
4,Annoying but loved by my children!,"The educational factor is in that you can learn english and spanish, letters and numbers but all my kids know is that it sings! They love to dance with it and my one year old (who received this as a gift for her birthday)can't seem to get enough of this but loves that her 4 year old brother with play on it with her as well!Awesome toy even if it gets a little annoying!"
2,Disappointing given it's price,"This is not a cheap toy, so I expected more. The words for the songs (ABCs, 123s) are muffled. Also they touted this as having a huge range of sounds when really it feels like only a few. There are 2 'real' songs.. the alphabet and the counting to ten song. The rest are just short words really, like 'Triangle', 'Red', 'Open'. A cheap handheld toy like the Bright Stars Music Player costs less than $8 and has a much better range of songs and sounds.The legs snap on and off easily, which I like, but they aren't sturdy. If your baby can't walk and needs to lean on something to stand, this is not the right toy for your child. It either scoots away and your baby falls, or it threatens to buckle and break.I wish I had made a difference choice."
3,Worth it!,My 12 month old is on his feet most all the time. He is walking and doesn't want to sit still for very long. I thought about getting this toy as a place he can stand and play. This doesn't keep his attention for too long but he goes back to it often. He is at the age when music makes him bounce and dance... he likes the tunes with this toy and it isn't annoying for the momma and pappa either.
2,Tipsy and too much going on,"We bought this toy for our twin 10 month old boys. They are beginning to pull up and I thought they'd be motivated to pull up so they can play on this toy. Unfortunately, the legs are really light weight and cheap and it tips over really easily.In addition, I think there's so much going on that they can't possibly learn from it. There must be 10 different buttons/levers/etc and they all result in a different sound. Our boys are hitting another button before the first sound is even done. Plus, the automated voice is really hard to understand.Our boys enjoy it, but I'm really unimpressed. I was trying to decide between this and a heavy, wooden toy and wish I would have gotten the other one."
2,noisy toy,"while the toy has many possibilities for years of enjoyment, the noise level is uncomfortably high. I would never buy this toy if I had known how annoying and ear busting it would be...dont' buy it..."
1,Where is my Leapfrog,I ordered a Leapfrog for a Christmas gift. It was described as being delivered but never was received. Very disappointing
1,Baby Vegas,This is a horrible toy for a child.The sights and sounds produced by this toy do not correlate to any desired trajectories of a healthy child's development: They push buttons and noises and sounds emanate from a garrish lump of plastic. What good does that do a child? What does that teach him or her?I suspect that children will be exposed to this garbage eventually without you having to spend a dime. Spend your own money wisely. Buy them something that requires them to use their imagination instead. Like a book. A book that you read to them.
1,Breaks easily,"I have bought 2 of these tables. The first one broke after about 6 weeks of my son playing with it starting when he was about 6 months. The different buttons stopped making the correct noises and then it started buzzing any time it was turned on. It didn't matter whether it was on the music page, learning page, Spanish setting, or English, it would still make the buzzing noise. My son was young so he was not beating on it or doing anything that should have caused a problem if it was made well. Because he absolutely loved it, I thought it might be a fluke so I got another one. Five weeks later the same things started happening again. I checked the warranty and it only last a month which is about as long as the table last. I am vert dissapointed in this product especially as much as my son loves it."
4,Great fun for toddler,"It's a lot of fun with so many buttons to push, so much light and sounds. The lid compartment is my 1-year-old's favorite place. He would open and close it all day long. I highly prefer an activities table that ""promotes"" music instruments over those have a ""baby phone"" or ""baby computer"" on it. The reason I deducted a star is that the legs are a bit flimsy."
2,Easily broken after one month use,"My little one likes playing with the table. But I am very disappointed with the quality. About one month after the baby (9 mos) started using it, the table did not work well. When I turned on it, music kept coming out. So noisy. Thus, I turned it off until I got a replacement. I was wondering how long the replacement would last before it's broken."
3,Better then most,"Great fun for the kids, our is quite old so they are very durable, I just wish it was a little quieter.Lots of interesting and different things to do, but I find it a little repetitive to listen to them playing with."
4,durable and great,I got this for my 13 month and he loves it. Good selection of music and buttons keeps him a busy for awhile. Large buttons are easy to reach and it is well built and sturdy!
5,Perfect toy!,"I purchased this toy when my son was about 7 months old and he loves it! He is able to pull up on it without it tipping over and he loves all of the sounds and music! In fact, my 3 year old has been playing with it a lot- she also loves all of the noises and listens to the ABCs and numbers in Spanish!"
3,Tip over too easily,This toy is overall fun for baby but is very lightweight and tip over too easily.I my baby girl is a peanut and still managed to tip it a couple of times hurting herself.I still let her play with it because she likes this toy but I put it against the wall to minimize the change of it tipping.
3,Better Toys Out There,I thought this toy would be great for my son - but since he learned to walk early he got very bored with this pretty quickly. He likes that he can switch the items from music to words (like ABCs...). But I think there are better toys out there that can keep him entertained for longer. He is now 1 1/2 and I dont' think he even looks at this anymore.
3,"maybe say ""attachable legs to use as standing toy""","Wish I had read the reviews that warn the legs don't really ""detach"" even though the box claims they are. Leapfrog customer service was extremely unhelpful and cavalier in their attitude. If your toddler cannot yet stand with ease, maybe put the toy without legs on sofa to test if your child can stand and play. Once you put the legs on, it IS possible to remove them with a butter knife, but it is VERY difficult (google for how to). I nearly wrenched my hand and shoulder doing it."
4,Love It,"We received this as a gift in 2006 for our then 9 month old, she played with it until she was over 2. Now we have pulled it back out for our second child, now also 9 months and they both love playing and dancing to it. My only complaint on our model is that the on/off and english/spanish switches are on the top which are accessible to the children we finally put a piece of tape over it so they couldn't play with the switch. They play with it constantly and it seems like we have only changed the batteries a few times."
5,As good as advertised,"I relied on the Amazon reviews when making this purchase. What a great purchase! My we bought it when my son was 7 months old, and he has continuously played with it for 2 months now. It is one of the few toys he has not outgrown. Buy with confidence!"
3,"My daughter LOVES this, but it crapped out after 4 months","We got our then 9 month old daughter this for Christmas. It now makes a loud and annoying sound..kind of like the speaker blew out? I changed the batteries and it hasn't fixed the issue. Such a disappointment because this is her favorite toy. For $40 this thing should have lasted well over 4 months, I feel cheated."
4,super fun toy,"I love this toy, my son is 1 and has so much fun.. and it entertains him so much! I recommend it. I even sing a long with the toy and play with my baby."
2,The Leap Frog Learning Table is better,"My mother in law has this table at her house for the grandkids and we have theLeapFrog LeapStart Learning Table(with the blue legs, basically same top without the Spanish) at ours. Our 8 month old loves the one we have - safe, sturdy, the music is in tune. When we used this one at my in-laws house, it fell over on him when he tried to pull himself up on it, which our blue-legged one has never done. The green circle key stuck and kept playing the sound over and over. In general it just seemed more cheaply made than the Leap Frog Learning Table. What's more, this one was bought new, and I got the Leap Frog Learning Table at a baby toy resale! I also like on ours that the buttons to turn it on are underneath and on this one they are on top where my son could make it louder (yikes) himself if he wanted to. Unless you're excited about the Spanish option, I'd get the LeapFrog LeapStart Learning Table."
5,My Daughter Loves It!,"I bought this for my daughter when she turned nine months old. She absolutely loves it. It's a great height for her when she sits on her bottom, knees, or pulls herself to a stand. She loves the ""book"" in the middle that she can turn (it changes the setting from ""music"" to ""words""). She loves every part of this table. It even keeps her distracted for up to 20 minutes at a time. Also, the quality appears to be great (we haven't had any issues)."
5,Good entertainer,My 8 month old daughter just loves this toy. Her attention span is very short but still she plays with this toy longer than compared to any other.I had trouble keeping her engaged all the time and was unable to do any household work. However after this toy came in things changed. Now my daughter is all by herself playing with this toy.I would recommend this toy for any kid who is just about trying to stand. It is a must have toy.
4,good purchase,I bought this musical table for my 9months old daughter. She likes it a lot. Music quality and build quality are good. The speakers started making jarring noises after a couple of weeks. I sent the item back and got a replacement. The new musical table works great.
4,Keeps 10 month entertained,This is my 10 month old baby's favorite toy in the house. She loves to stand up holding on to it and dance to all the different sounds. It keeps her entertained. It is not as sturdy as I would like since some babies who cannot walk as yet use it to hold themselves up. I have it braced on the side of the wall and I make sure I hold it every time my baby is using it. Lots of fun!
2,Not very durable,"To clarify, the outer shell seems very durable, and the toy itself is really great had it lasted. After being pounded on a few times (only by a baby though), it doesn't work well anymore. Some of the buttons activate the wrong response and it will often get stuck sounding like a rapid-fire broken record... The only way to fix it is to turn it off then back on, and sometimes that wont even work."
1,"Lead, Arsenic and Bromine!","I was mildly disappointed that the the audio cuts in an out after a few months of use. I was looking for a solution, when I ran into a report that states this toy contains lead, bromine and arsenic!!! This is terrible in a child's toy, how can this go into production?SOURCE - [...]Potential Hazard Category: Contains Potentially Toxic ChemicalsToy Name: Learn and Groove Musical TableManufacturer: Leap FrogPotential Hazard Description: 2009 laboratory tests of this product found high levels of bromine and low levels of lead and arsenic. Please see the toxic chemi-cals key at the end of this report for more information."
1,This product contains lead!,"I found out that this product contains lead!!! See this website for details [...]Even though the amount of lead is probably below the recall level, any amount of lead could be harmful for young children according to pediatricians."
4,Great musical table,"I really love this and my baby loves it, it gives her endless fun, it is more than loud enough and has so many different songs, and sounds. The only thing I dont like is the fact that the new legs are missing the addition feet that the older models have. I actually contacted the company to see if they would ship me the feet to make it sturdier but they refused to do so and said the new models dont need the feet. I cant confirm because my child is still using this table without the legs."
2,Broke after 2 weeks,"This was a really fun toy for my 7 month old...that is, until it broke after only 2 weeks. Never even got to attach the legs on it--and did not receive extensive wear in only 2 weeks! Something in the sound malfunctioned--so that whenever you press any button, the sound ""sticks"" and just makes a clicking noise that won't stop until you press a different button. Then it'll play music again for a couple seconds and ""stick"" again. The concept is great--my little one loved the toy itself--but very poor reliability. Save your money--find an alternative brand for this toy."
2,Sharp edges on inner side of legs,"The inner side of the leg of this musical table has several sharp edges and our baby got scratches on her hands/legs/forehead as she crawls within it. I don't understand why leap frog has designed the inner legs with the sharp edges. It does not make any sense at all to me. Instead it would have been nice to have simple smooth/rounded legs on inner side, the way it is on outer side."
3,Broken on arrival,"The bad. The screws to get the batteries put in would simply not come out. Man drive screw drivers, electric screw drivers all no use. Too tight or melted or something. So we cut the bottom plastic to get the plate off because it is too much work to ship back a toy we already put together.The good. Our son likes this toy. And until he learns to flip it over and pull the batteries out, it will be fun."
4,Nice table toy,"We purchased this item for our son back when he was about 5 months old. I liked the fact that you could remove the legs so he could sit and play with it. Although, up until now, he has not had much interest in it. Now that he is 10 months old and standing on his own, he has really taken to playing with this on a regular basis. It has become one of his favorites. It is great for cruising. And even though the item description says it is great for pulling up, it seeme that this table constantly topples over whenever he tries to pull himself up on it. That would have to be my only drawback."
5,Great even for a 4 month old!,"This was a great purchase. We got it for our daughter a month ago when she was 4 months old. After we would show her how to make the music go, she would do it herself! She learns so fast and loves this toy!"
3,Short-lived interest,"Like some other reviewers, my 14 month old liked this table when he was younger, to pull up and cruise along. He doesn't play with it anymore--I think I liked it better than he did. Good idea, but longevity isn't there, not worth purchasing in retrospect."
2,Too Small,"Toy is a bit smaller than we anticipated which makes it awkward for my daughter to play with it. The issue is with the stand/legs. My daughter, 11 months old, is already too tall for the table. She has to hunch down which is uncomfortable for her. We ended detaching the legs. We tried returning it, but Amazon will charge close to $9 for return. so we kept the toy. I like the idea of a musical table as long as its taller."
4,One Year Old Loves It,"We just received this toy as a birthday present for our one-year-old daughter and it's a definite hit. She bops along to all the songs and interacts with the toy when we didn't think she would. For example, when it says, ""bye-bye"" she says bye-bye back. Pretty cute stuff. There's a lot to do with this toy, she doesn't tire of it, and it keeps her busy for a long period of time. All good things."
3,It's ok,I think I enjoy this toy more then my son. It's very educational. But for the age group its directed at its not practical. He basically uses it as a step stool which is why I say it is durable. Other then that he really doesn't use it.
3,It slides around,"I got this table when my son was just learning to stand. Unfortunately, since he wasn't a pro at standing he often leans on the table which is so light it slides. I remedied this by sticking the table in a corner but its not ideal. Other than that its a good toy, but I find now he is bored with it and rarely uses it. (that's only 6 weeks later)"
3,Fun while it lasted...,"I got this for my son on his 1st birthday. He absolutely loved it. It played lots of fun music and we would dance to it. He played with it a lot. Unfortunately, about two months after we got it, it started getting stuck on a certain piece of music. It would play the same thing over and over like a skipping CD. Now it is skipping so fast that it makes a really annoying buzzing noise. Great idea, just couldn't stand up to daily play."
5,Great Birthday present for any toddler,"This product was given to my grand daughter on her 1st birthday. It was one of her favorites and she learned much from it. She danced to the music and learned how to count and sing.It was such a big hit I bought it for my niece this Christmas and watched as my grand daughter taught my niece how to use it.The best part is that now the toy is bi-lingual and my sister-in-law's family is from South America so my niece will be learning letters, numbers and colors in both English and Spanish."
5,Great toy,"I bought this toy for my 8-month old grandson, at my daughter's suggestion. It is a total winner. The baby loves it and he can either stand or sit to play with it. His 3-year-old brother, who also loves it, can play with it simultaneously. Since it has four active sides I suppose 2 other children could also play but I haven't seen that yet. Also, since thank goodness its music is digital, it stays in tune!"
4,My child enjoys it,"My child enjoys this toy. At 12 months old, it occupies him for 10-15 minutes at a time. He loves turning pages and pressing buttons, which this toy allows him to do. Unfortunately he has managed to flip it over at least once already; I hoped it would be more sturdy."
2,too thin,"First bottle was to thick, you could not pure anything out, now it is just diluted water and after 7 days the bottle is gone between my two children.For the money you are getting thin water and I am not sure if the concentration of minerals is the same"
5,Just what I needed,"This handle kit was just what I needed to replace a broken handle on the Delta faucet for my utility sink. Not sure why the previous one broke but it did. The item description says ""metal"" but it's plastic with ""chrome"" plating just like the one that broke. I couldn't find this item at either of the major, nationwide home improvement stores either in their stores or at their online sites but Amazon had the item and it was eligible for Amazon Prime shipping so I got it quickly. You can get the part a little cheaper from the manufacturer but the cheapest shipping they offer costs almost as much as the part."
1,Download the framework online instead,This book is very confusing for OT practitioners. Not even my professor went by this book. I would suggest to download or print out OT framework or google. Thats what got me through the class.
4,Very satisfied,Very satisfied with my purchase. Believe that it will be a big help to me with my class. It makes a good complementary book to our regular textbook
3,NOT REALLY ALL MY STYLE OF BLUES,"I OWN ""BAND IN THE POCKET #1 AND LIKE IT VERY MUCH. I'M A BLUES HARPIST AND USE THAT CD WHEN I PERFORM ON THE STREETS OF NEW ORLEANS. B.I.T.P.#2 IS ALSO GOOD, BUT CONTAINS TRACKS THAT ARE NOT REALLY BLUES NUMBERS (4 & 5.) ALSO, SOME OF THE TRACKS CONTAIN PROGRESSIONS THAT ARE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW....DEFINATELY NOT A 1,4,5 PROGRESSION. OVERALL IT'S NOT A BAD CD AND I'LL USE IT...BUT I LIKE #1 BETTER. JERSEY SLIM"
2,not made of driftwood,"please read the description carefully,,,,this is not made out of wood but made out of resin in china....it is heavy enough but not hand sculpted or even scuplted at all.....for that reason i am dissappointed...I am not sure why they put driftwood in the name of this product but for that reason i feel deceived and dissappointed....this product is not what i was expecting at all...."
5,Sweet,Sweet story. Love these books for my little ones. The lessons are priceless and memily is perfect for tall little girl.
2,save your money and watch online.,This over-priced DVD helps but you can watch it all for free on youtube.com. It doesnt go much further in depth than the paper guide though. You just need to be patient and figure everything our on your own but dont spend over 30 bucks on this.
1,Don't waste your time,The prose was overwritten and florid. I found none of the characters to be likeable or interesting. The author portrays Italy as a country of unwashed rapists; I found the xenophobic attitude throughout the book to be extremely off-putting.
3,Not Her Best,"I have enjoyed her other books...but, this one was a yawner. Too slow moving, too repitious, did not grab my attention at all...Joe was a jerk! I hope she does not start pumping out books like other authors just to sell them. All I can do is hope the next one will have a little more substance. Way too much fluff..."
3,Disappointed somewhat,"I had always had a certain picture of Italy in my mind, but now it seems forboding and stinky from the descriptions presented in this book. The characters drink so much I wonder how they can function. I thought it was a strange story line. I didn't see how this woman who was so afraid to leave her own area, could go 1/2 way around the world and get along so well so suddenly. But it is only a story after all."
5,Transported me to the canals of Venice and streets of Rome,"Having been to Italy on holiday, I must say that Hill Towns engaged my soul and transported me back there over and over -- from Cafe San Eustachius in Roma to the canals of Venezia to the streets of Firenze -- I was there with Cat and Joe, seeing and feeling everything. Anne Rivers Siddons' ability to capture the setting and give it to her readers is pure heaven."
3,Breaking Out of the Cocoon,"Catherine clings to her husband and the security of the mountaintop where she's always lived. The traumatic death of her parents early in her life triggered agoraphobia.Now with counseling, she pushes herself to expand beyond the cloistered home and small college circle that comprised their comfortable, but restricted life.Wanting to please her husband, she stretches herself to visit Italy. In the company of young newlyweds and a renowned artist and his wife, Cat and her husband, Joe, experience the wonders of Rome, Venice and Tuscany. The basics of their marriage shifts and raises questions they never faced before.I greatly enjoyed the travel descriptions, but found Cat's fearful personality pretty depressing. I wanted to see her blossom and bring about a happy ending. Instead, the complex mix of who-loves-who becomes ultimately destructive to all."
5,I enjoyed this book,The book HILL Towns arrived promptly after I ordered it.I enyoy all of Anne Rivers Siddons books and so enjoyed this one also.It was a good study in relationships as are all her books.
5,Siddon's best,"I have enjoyed all of her books, but this is far the best. Her descriptions of Italy made me feel I was there, her protagonist's changes through out the novel. Made me wish for a sequel, just to find out what had happened once they returned home"
2,Disappointing,"After reading and loving 4 other Anne Rivers Siddons books I could hardly wait to sit down with this book. It is a 400 page story of a group of people traveling Italy and eating and sightseeing and eating and sightseeing with a little sexual tension thrown in. If this was my first Siddons book I probably would have never bought a second one. It is certainly not in the same league as her book ""Up Island."""
1,Where is her editor?,"The plot of Hill Towns could have been developed into an enjoyable novel, but Ms. Siddons style has come to overshadow her story. The vast majority of her sentences include a cloying and overblown simile or metaphor and sound like they were written for a creative writing assignment titled ""Write a story using as many simles and metaphors as you possibly can"". Where is the editor of this book? Isn't it his/her job to weed the material?"
