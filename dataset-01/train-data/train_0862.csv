1,Abysmal,"I purchased this unit for fifty bucks and still overpaid. Only bought it to listen to some old 50s and 60s vocal 33s I own, so wasn't expecting very much. The sound quality is just terrible-so tinny I couldn't listen to it. I'd recommend a good vintage 60s or 70s record player over this one. Avoid this and if you must buy, get a cheap remaindered or refurbished one."
4,Does the job but does not look like the picture,"I bought this for my husband as a gift. He absolutely loved it! BUT I was a little disappointed - if you are concerned about the aesthetic of this item (as I was), the tan colour is not as pictured - the colour is more of a brown colour. Also, the item I received does not have the Crosley logo inside the lid.. All in all though, it does what it is supposed to and my husband was happy with it.."
2,unreliable,"i got this record player for christmas, when i opened it i didnt notice the paper that said you have to click it to the right to start it and i spent quite a while trying to figure it out, i think they definitely should have put a switch to start and stop it instead of having having to pull it all the way to the right. after figuring out how to start it, the first problem arose, the part that lifts up the stylus for 45's was getting in the way of the record, and like 90% of all records, it was slightly bent, so when i played a record it would bump into the part sticking out, i ended up cutting it off because i couldnt play half the albums i had. now today, i was listening to a song and suddenly it stops half way through, whatever mechanism that makes it stop at the end of records got moved up so the thing stops spinning half way through the record... i dont know how easily fixable this is, but for the $100 i paid, crosley should make a better quality product for that kind of money"
3,"Overpriced, tracking force will degrade your records FAST!","This record player is a neat idea, however it was manufactured cheaply. There is no adjustable tone arm, and the tracking force (the force the stylus, or needle places on the record as it spins) is over 7 grams which amounts to several times the optimal tracking force. This will cause rapid degradation of your vinyl and the many of the tones will be muted out even if the record is in good condition. It's better to spend your money on a second hand Goodwill or Salvation Army turntable with an adjustable tone arm, buy a new cartridge, a stylus tracking force gauge and connect it to a phono amp or a receiver."
1,Plays too fast. ALL THREE that I purchased.,"To make a very long story very short, I first purchased from Crosley their 4 in 1 turntable. It played too fast. Closer to 35-36 RPMs, making everyone sound like they were on helium.So I returned it, and purchased the Crosley portable turntable in black. It also, played too fast, closer to 35-36 RPMs.So I returned that one, and purchased the Crosley protable turntable in tan, the product you see here. It also, ran too fast.The jist of it? Crosley turntables are poorly made, with a total lack of concern for proper playing speeds. As long as you don't mind (or won't notice), your records playing about 10% faster than they should be, and your singers sounding like they are on helium, by all means buy this product. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,seriously???,"i bought this model back in 2002 and recently dusted it off to spin some 78's that were left to me. i was so excited to listed to these great records but was quickly disappointed when the player wouldn't operate...and then i remembered, it never really did work properly. after several minutes the unit develops a loud hum and if you turn up the volume, it just gets louder too. the arm slides across the vinyl and or completely stops the table from spinning. i can't see that it's worth it to even have it fixed. so, i went online to look into buying a new record player and read all the great reviews for crosley...i almost bought a new one until i looked at the brand of the one i have & discovered it also is a crosley. no sense buying another piece of junk.save your money..."
3,Expect what you pay for,"This record player was adequate for playing records, but it does seem to be made out of rather cheap parts. It was dissapointing to get it and not have it work properly from the very start. The first record I put in there would not play past the first two songs, because the automatic shut-off was not set properly. Fortunately, I was able to take the thing apart and fix the problem. It has been functioning fine after that, but I really think that it's poor assembly shows how well the quality control was for this product. I can not comfortably recomend this product for someone who expects a good quality machine."
4,"yup, i like it.","it's not top quality, but i wasn't expecting that.it works well.the tone knob is key, use it to get better sounds.yup, i like it.if you want a cool looking, but totally not authentic BUT USEABLE record player, this is an OK choice.Im not disappointed."
4,Almost Perfect,"This item is a wonderful machine for educational programs. It has settings for all three speeds. Unfortunately, the cord and adapter do not fit inside. We had to sew a bag which attaches to the carrying handle in order to keep the cord with the product. Seems kind of labor intensive for something we paid so much money for."
2,Sad all day long!,I was so pumped to get this record player! I played my 78s and 42s for a good two weeks before the thing just took a steaming dump on me. The speakers went out on the thing! This would be a good option for someone that wants to play records every once in a while. If you're planning on playing records a lot this is not a good option. I don't think that this is what it's built for. Record junkies beware!! p.s. i'm sendin this sunovabiatch back :(
4,Nice little unit,"If you are looking for a no fuss vinyl recorder player, this is definitely the choice. The build quality is what you would expect from Crosely and although there was more plastic parts than I had expected, it doesn't show up in sound quality. The built in speakers are better than I had anticipated and over all if you are looking for a portable and good looking unit, I would highly recommend that you purchase this player.I would further suggest that you buy a slip mat (I'm very particular about my vinyl) just to give more sound definition and to protect your vinyl form the rubber feet that are on the turntable.Keep in mind that this is a little unit that isn't for high end users. It's suited to those who just wanted to listen to records without all fluff that some of the more high-end players have.Personally I am in love with mine and nothing beats listening to your favourite music on vinyl."
1,Disapointed:Got what I payed for,"As the man in the first review said that you see: you get what you paid for! The case on this looks great but I plugged it in and turned it on and the turntable didn't turn. Dang, I got what I paid for!!!! $113 is too much to loose and I'm getting my money back!!!"
1,Third crosley not a charm,"The first crosley was an all inclusive, turntable, CD, Cassette deck cool look....... 3 months later each component failed one at a time. second crosley I bought for my daughter to listen to some old Records i had when I was a kid. By the end of a year i was tired of putting the Belt/ rubber band back on the turntable. Instead of me throwing it out in frustration i threw it out because it just died shortly there after. Third model (this one) i currently have, very basic, same deal, for kids to listen to records. Currently we have to wedge a block between the cover and the on/volume knob to get it to work. Now it seems a lot of people like this model but perhaps the honeymoon is not over yet. Crosleys look good and structurally seem durable enough but if you have to disassemble one (over and over) the cheapness of the electronics becomes quite apparent. If your first crosley fails, try a new brand.... a third crosley is not a charm."
5,You won't stop laughing!,"This is a great game for just about all ages. Brings out the imagination in everyone. We laugh a lot when we play this game. Great as an alternative to TV, computer, etc. Brings the whole family together!"
5,Lots of Fun!,Bought two sets for my children/grandchildren.Have great fun playing with them when I go to their homes.Lots of laughs and they get to use their imagination which is great!
4,fun game,This is a fun game for kids. Lets them play out things instead of just sitting and tossing dice. Mu daughter had a blast and it has become one of our regular games now.
4,Charades... Can't go wrong!,"The board game itself makes it a point to keep track of how well each player is doing over all and who ever does best at guessing and performing the acts will move faster on the board. Frankly, if you have older kids, the game is pretty good just for the sake of the variety of charade options it can give you. My kids and I just sat through going through the cards and performing each card in full. I would say you are likely better off just getting it for the ideas simply for kids."
2,Not worth it for 50 cards,"We bought this game (maybe obviously) because we were hoping to play charades with a child who can't read yet. We are a frequent game playing family and so went through the 50 picture cards in just a few rounds. The kids were really excited about this game in the beginning, but now that we're back to whispering in the hallway and trying not to hear each other, we all get frustrated and frankly don't choose it much anymore."
2,My Poem,"Dreams the dreams only you can see I could, of, course, also just stand on my head take my hand and fly across tonight with me never get out of bed I now wonder if in bed be the link to dead. For the horror of love is waiting for you or will the waking be a rebirth of my thoughts then cry this poor tear out of my eye or the inntension of being kissed by you and never kissing n-e one else."
4,The Labrynth of our Minds,"This is a story about general Simon Bolivar as he travels from port to portreminiscing about the people and events that he has encountered in his lifetime. The author communicates these events through Flashback, wich if it weren't for the author using this technique then the book would be very short and uneventful. He remembers the in his life and how they have affected him during his lifetime and during this voyage that he expects to be his last, as this Tired, sick, old man tries to find a place to spend his final years in peace.In my opinion the reason this book is called what it is, is the fact that they are portraying the general through his own mind, therefore the General in his Labrynth. The reader unfolds this long, dark, twisted hallway of the generals mind, reading about the people and events in his life, and also discovering the type of man that he is."
5,An Amazing Man: And A Masterful Blending of Fact and Fiction,"With the style and eloquent language that earned him the Nobel prize for literature, Marquez weaves a stunning story of glory and despair. Both real history and Marquez' imagination let us enter the world of Simon Bolivar, Liberator of South America, in all his humanity - good and evil.Bolivar drove the Spanish out of South America, dealt with treachery from his own compatriots. Once hailed as a hero, he is now scorned and reviled, and fighting his own demons, he refuses to die quietly.We are given a glimpse of the genius and foibles of the man behind the legend, as we accompany him on his last journey, accompanied only by the loyal remants of his once great army.It is almost guaranteed that after reading this book you will want to travel to South America and to read more about the places and colorful characters who come to life in this book"
3,TIRED,"This book, reviewing the last days of a great man, is very sad and drawn out. It has the nightmarish, dreamy, other worldly qualities found in the author's writing but the book dragged. Events were slow in unwinding with no climax. Maybe that is the way life ends for a man who has lost greatness and succombs to illness."
4,Labrynth By Seamus And Aaron,"This is a story about general Simon Bolivar as he travels from port to port reminiscing about people and events that he has encountered in his life time. The author communicates these events through flashback, which if it weren't for this method of writing, the book would be very short. He remembers the people in his life and how they have effected him while he is on a voyage to try and escape his old life.The reason this book is called what it is, is because the labrynth the title refers to is the generals mind. The reader unfolds this long, dark hallway of turns and doors as the book progresses discovering new people and places the general visits."
5,Bought it for a class,"Ended up being inspired by it. Marquez is a writer who has inspired so many through his writing and since reading this, I can see why."
3,Marquez Mystique,"I am glad to have read several of Gabriel Gracia Marquez' books, given they are considered great works. I found them to be compelling (I never wanted to put the book down), and yet, I don't feel I am able to adequately appreciate his material; I think a better appreciation requires more knowledge of (or at least exposure to) his cultural context. There's something about his writing TONE that makes the reader want to be very sympathetic towards the characters. However, I never really felt I understood them."
1,SeductresS,"Although GABO is my favorite author ... But this is his worst book ever ... Go for 100 years of solitude, love in the time of cholera, in evil hour or any of his great novels ... But not this one"
3,"Solid, But Certainly Not His Best","For those of us who have come to love Marquez, this book comes as a slight disappointment. The story of Bolivar's final journey and his relationship both with a myriad of women and with his servant is full of interesting insights and anecdotes, but lacks the kind of beauty, especially in respects to setting and language, that his previous work displays. Maybe it's because he was trying to honor or at least chronicle an important figure in South American history, but the novel seems too confined in scope. Marquez is forced to confine his normally tangential and often beautiful descriptions to the life of a celebrated figure. That being said, this book is still a fascinating read and better than most of the novels on the market today."
5,Get you kids to read these books... They'll love them.,If you're looking for a series to make your kids think without knowing that they are... this one is for them. Very well written series that will increase their vocabulary in leaps and bounds while thoroughly entertaining them and keeping them on the edge of their seats the whole time.
5,Love it,"Small, fits perfect in my living room. Searched different stores and found the best deal on amazon.com. I waited a few years to buy this and im so glad I did."
5,Godparent gift,Given as a godparent gift and truly represents how I feel about my son's godmother. Shipped and arrived in great condition
5,So beautiful!,I give my grown daughter a Willow Tree angel every year for Christmas. She had her first child this year and this angel was perfect for her. She got tears in her eyes when she saw it and said it will be placed in her baby's nursery.
5,Beautiful for decoration,"I bought this for my nieces baptism. We used it to decorate the table with the cake and chocolates. It looks very nice just like the picture. The quality is very good, I would definitely buy another one."
3,lazer moon was the movie but it is not a good movie,this move was not very good you do better looking for something else cause it wont grab your attention and you be a sleep in a few min
3,Great for the Price,I love archos pvp's so i thought i would check out their mp3 players. I love the way music is put on and taken off the unit (drag and drop is the only way to go)! The only problem i have found is that the screen is cheap and has very poor picture. Other than that is seems like a good unit so far.
3,Decent slipper,"For years I've worn the Romika slippers, but they don't make them anymore. So I've tried the Europedica slippers. They look just like the Romikas, but they don't have the arch support or feel of the Romikas. Still, they're the best substitute I've found so far. I can still stand on them for a long time without my feet getting tired."
2,Don't bother if you have already tried the Romika brand.,"I also ordered these thinking they were the Romika, mokasso 102 for women. And, I returned them. They did not feel at all like the real thing, the romika's. I am really disappointed they are not making these anymore! :("
2,what built-in arch support???,"First of I ordered them from the Footsmart catalog and not from amazon, the reason I mention this is because I want to warn you all that they do NOT pay for return shipping! I had big expectations for these because of the high price (I usually never pay more than 25. - for any house slippers)I specifically wanted good quality slippers with a great built-in arch support ...as far as I can say is it does not have any arch support! I also don't consider them soft or cozy; they feel rock hard on my feet. They are definitely not worth the money and are why too overpriced. 15. - walmart slippers are 10 times better than those. They only good thing about them is that they look good and the none slip rubber soles; at least you can't fall on your butt to easily when you walk on tiles or wood.I would say save your money."
1,Not as it appears,I bought this show because it was the closest thing I could find to the Romika's that I'd had and wore out. I could no longer find the Romika's so I tried this shoe. The Europedica was ill-fitted with poor construction. Bah Humbug!
3,Imitation Romika,"In twenty words or less, they are a good imitation but not the real thing.Otherwise they are a good slipper if you are looking for this kind."
3,Not best choice for plantar faciatis issues,"My only complaint is that they were advertised as having arch support and specifically, good for plantar faciatis issues. Not exactly true, although, they ARE significantly better than the average slipper."
2,Not enough on DTS,"This is the first book to come out on DTS that I'm aware of. Unfortunatly, this book is heavily focused on the development of VB apps that work with SQL Server. There is a pretty good DTS object heirarchy in the appendix, but the 2 chapters on DTS cover only the basics."
2,Very VB oriented -- Pretty light on DTS,"I bought this book to assist me with a project that required moving and manipulating data between heterogeneous data sources. DTS seemed to be the right tool to do this and that proved to be true in the end.However, this book was not a great assistance. The authors fill the book with various VB examples, which would be great, if I was augmenting my DTS packages with VB - but I wasn't. Rather, what would have been of great, are examples of raising errors, handling non-tabular input and output, and any nuances not revealed in Microsoft's help documents (which ended up being my main source of help).In short, unless you are looking strictly for VB answers to DTS questions, I'd wait to see what other books come out. And they will, because DTS actually works great once its set up correctly."
1,"Professional SQL Server SQL-DMO, SQL-NS and DTS","This is an absolute rehash of the SQL Server Books Online, the samples are too. It is very light on DMO, SQL Namespace Objects and DTS. It is all very basic, does not explain the main concepts of SQL-DMO, does not explain the meta data cache for example. The biggest part of the book are the Appendix which are object models and rehashes of Microsoft matrials."
4,Live from Europe,A great live quartet date with Bobby on Alto Sax and a rhythm section led by pianist Jim McNeeley. The standard But Not For Me needs to be played on alto and Bobby delivers a robust performance. There is one short tune with a conga player added but it is easily avoided. But Not For Me-Karita-Round Midnight-ETA over and out.-- DIG IT!
2,Not a good training manual,"This book is too inconsistent to be of any real use in my opinion, riddled with discrepancies throughout the manual to the point of total confusion when compared with actual Suite MX 2004 applications.I Honestly found myself in the middle like a referee between this manual's errors and my MX suite where the book indicates steps that the application cannot perform because it's not stated correctly, it does not indicates where thing are located clear.I got more useful applicable information from the programs tutorial section than this book which is riddled with miscalculated steps in the process, this books is not a good source for learning this powerful Studio MX Suite 2004 and how to integrate them together. Try Eric Hunley's book instead.Stay away from buying this book, instead spend the money on a nice dinner for your significant other, you'll find more satisfaction in that then trying to follow this mess of instructions. Good Luck."
2,"word ""training"" misleading","This book is a good introdcution to the studio as a whole. But not very helpful if you want to be more than a beginner. You learn a few tricks, but you don't learn how powerful the programs actaully are.I bought this book in the hopes of learning fireworks very detailedly, and also have a source to learn the other programs when it was more convenient. Instead, I am back on Amazon (5 days later) ordering a book just on Fireworks, and expect to do the same when I want to get more intimate with the other programs.Terence Stephenswww.ondemand-design.com"
4,Mostly good,I have had previous experience with the Macromedia Suite and found the book a good way to introduce each piece of software and how each piece integrates with the others. The book does contain some typos and leaves out some steps though.
2,mislead,The description of this book/CD does not state that the software included is only a 30-day trial. I purchased the book/CD for a college class and the software was not long enough to even get me through the 6 week class. It would have been nice to know that ahead of time - I had to drop the class.
4,Great resource,I recommend this entire series of books from Macromedia. They have expansive coverage of the Flash application and the skills needed to master the program. I highly recommend it to an midlevel to advanced level designer.Can't wait to see what they publish next! sign me up for the Macromedia Studio 8: Training for the Source book. enjoy and happy designing.
5,Worth EVERY penny!!!,"Over the course of years, I have bought and collected quite a number of Muay Thai DVDs . However this DVD easily BEST all of them in terms of clarity, depth and presentation. It definitely sets the NEW standard for all Muay Thai DVDs in the market. Worth every single penny of my hard earned money !"
1,Jewish Paranoia gone hay-wire,"This book is Jewish Paranoia gone hay-wire. After reading it you may think Austria is the scariest place on earth. It's not so much that the reporting is shotty and one-sided, it's the general sense of conspiracy that is ludicrous. ML"
1,"pretty good info, but printing errors","I got this book after I went to the trinity alps, and the information is definitely good, however there was a whole section that was just missing from the book; I suppose it was a printing error or something."
1,Definitely not gold,"Please do not waste your money. This anklet is not gold and comes in a very big fit. I am a size 7 in shoes and my ankle is a bit bigger than ""normal"" yet it still fits huge. Do not recommend. Waste of money."
1,This is NOT an anklet!!!,"The size is too long to be an anklet, and it's so thick for being an anklet. I Believe anklets should be fine and thin, I did return this product."
4,Elephant parade,"Gift item that was much appreciated. Will have to have it sized for the ankle, but otherwise it was great."
1,elephant ankle bracelet,I was quite disapointed with this ankle bracelet. It is very cheap looking and it is also way too big.
1,Disappointed!!!!,"I've been eyeing this ankle bracelet for months. I purchased it so I could wear it on Mother's Day. It was shipped on time,and it looked beautiful. I put it on right away and two days later my ankle had a black circle around it,and the anklet was changing colors. I removed it,washed it off with a mild cleanser made for costume jewelry. It was still a little off color but shiny enough to wear. Four days later to my horror it had turned a brownish copper color it was no longer wearable. It was suppose to be plated in 14k gold, if it was,it was a very thin layer. SO SO disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS ANKLE BRACELET. I'm returning it for a refund."
1,peice of crap,This thing is not the sixe it said it is and the leather used is garbage . My dog got this peice of crap off in 1 minute . If you need a muzzle DO NOT BUY IT ONLINE go get one at a store so you know you have the right size
3,A Good Thorough Book,"The book is thorough and covers all the topics in Quantum mechanics.The chapters follow just the way Q.M developed over the years.The reader would find it even more interesting if he/she has some background in Classical Mechanics because Messiah often refers to Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Action and Hamiltonian in general.The book also develops Bra-Ket algebra in a very easy way, something I have not seen any other book.Messiah's way of treating scattering problems is quite different from that of the others. He doesn't make use of Green's Function but uses the wave-packet approach.This books gets 3 stars because it's quite verbose. Messiah often gets stuck in explaining things over and over again(therefore the size of the book!). The drawback is that there are few problems per chapter and are quite difficult. This does not help the student gain confidence in the subject. The book assumes you are familiar with Electrodynamics."
5,A superb eposition,"Messiah is one of the first QM books I bought, (french edition) almost 40 years ago. I found it pretty difficult at the time, yet after many years and many books, it's hard to find another presentation definitely superior. It's not for beginners, but you can count on it, any time you look back for somehing you find a very clear and complete exposition. You're groping for an angular momentum formula? It's there, no need to go for an angular momentum book. Yet it is not a bible, it's stylish, lucid, general. It's long, not verbose, because it explains carefully, with details, and mathematically rigorous (without going into functional analysis). True, it lacks some newer topics, but with a firm grasp of the fundamentals, it's easy to get them from separate sources. The Dover edition is a real gem."
4,"Swingy, Bright & Cheery day !","On a platter these albums are happy trips through some well known songs of the day. Sung with a swingy feel they do reminisce of good old Frank Sinatra. Although the material isn't tailor made for Doris's style it does gleam with nice versions of ""Steppin' out with my baby"", ""Let's take a walk around the block"", ""Singin' in the rain"", ""Happy Talk"", ""Make someone happy"" & ""On the sunny side of the street"". These albums make pleasant listening ! Stephen Munns (...)"
3,Too Small,"My son got this as a b-day present, and I'm really disappointed with it. My son seems too love it, but I really wish it was bigger. The picture is really deceiving. The table and bench seats inside are microscopic. Also the floor is really hard to keep clean because it's textured."
3,"Good size for an inside playhouse, but not worth the money","I purchased the Four Seasons Playhouse for my 3-year-old son to play with inside during the winter. It is a great size for indoor play and the doorbell is a nice feature, but there really is not a lot to the playhouse and my son gets bored with it quickly. The worst thing about the playhouse (and the reason I say it is not worth the money) is that the door falls off constantly! It takes very little pressure to make this happen and it happens so often we cannot leave the room when our son plays with the playhouse, because we get 2 steps away and we're right back there putting the door back on. I guess I wouldn't mind so much if this were a discount toy from a no-name company, but I expected more, especially with a price-tag over $150. At that price, I simply cannot recommend this toy."
5,You must read this!,"Having read Driven to Distraction and Answers to Distraction, I was curious about Connect. It is a very personal book, and Dr. Hallowell shows us more about his own life and committment to what he does than in his other books. He says it from the heart. If we connect with other human beings, life improves. It seems so obvious, but it takes someone like Dr. Hallowell to make connecting imperative. It changed my life. Thanks, Dr. Hallowell!"
4,The Intersting Book,"This book is about a boy and a girl (main characters). Their names are Beth Lambert and Philip Hall. Beth likes Philip and she wants to find out if Philip really likes her but he won't say anything . Philip beats her in classwork , conniving and just about anything . The story also talks about Beth wanting to go to Philip's birthday but she found out that she can't because he is inviting a lot of boys and he doesn't want to get embarrassed or anything. I liked this book because... I like the relationships between Philp and Beth. I think that you might even like this book because it talks about interesting things like relationships and liking people."
5,A delightful trip back to my childhood,"This is a very enjoyable story that really reminded me of what it was like to be an 11 year old girl. Bette Greene does an excellent job of portraying the relationships that exist between boys and girls at this age. I found myself reminiscing about my own childhood and relating to the book's heroine, Beth Lambert, who goes through the bittersweet experience that nearly every young girl experiences at some point: having a crush on a boy. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun, easy read that you won't want to put down!"
4,My daughter loves this game!,I bought this a Christmas present for my 3 1/2 year old daughter. She loves games and loves learning. She doesn't know all of her letters yet but she can still play by matching the letter to the ones on her card. This game would be pretty quick except for she makes you have to get both words filled on the card instead of just one. I think the buzzing for bingo is cute. I am very happy with this purchase.
3,"Good Rabbit Care Book, Great Pictures!","THE ESSENTIAL RABBIT is a relatively recent addition to rabbit care books. It contains all of the basic information about rabbit care and has more of a focus on keeping rabbits indoors which is helpful. The author paid great attention to the organization and layout of the book which makes the book easy to use. While other rabbit books such as WHY DOES MY RABBIT by Anne McBride and THE HOUSE RABBIT HANDBOOK contain more in depth information, this book would be wonderful to use with children. It is well organized and easy to read, so parents and children can use the book together.There is one strength of this book over most of the other rabbit care books which may be a major reason why I purchased the book. I am an amateur photographer and this book has some of the best photographs of rabbits. It will give the reader plenty of ideas for photographing pets. I find it is simply a pleasure to rummage through the pages from time to time."
3,"Provides basics, but not much on behaviors","This book covers how to take good care of a rabbit, but it doesn't say much about rabbit behaviors or instincts. It doesn't explain circling, spraying, nipping, digging, and other common rabbit behaviors.The book primarily describes how to take care of a pet rabbit, and that information is thorough and well written. It is written simply enough for a child age 8+ to understand."
5,The Essential Rabbit,"This is a wonderful book that explains everything from basic care and diseases to litter training! For 4-H Rabbit Project members to the rabbit fancier, The Essential Rabbit is a must-have for all rabbit lovers!"
2,"Okay Soup, Horrible Delivery Service","The quality of this soup is just okay, some of the chicken pieces have some fat bits on them (gross). They should use trimmed white meat only. I found the same level of quality in the Heathly Choice Chicken Rice soup, so this one is at least slightly better because it uses wild rice, not white rice. Worse though - - is that I ordered my last package of these soups on March 7 and just received them today on March 28th. That's 3 weeks transit time - just ridiculous. They used the post office instead of UPS, the post office (in my area at least) is nearly incompetent. I will never order this soup again knowing that they ship it via the post office. The Healthy Choice Veg. soup they ship UPS, so I'll stick with that... I get it in 3 days - that's the way it should be."
1,I better not get myself started,"This book was not only way too long but it was difficult to read and her views just really are not in line. Stuff like, We need this and we need that. One of the many things that bugged me in this book was saying that we needed to read the bible with a special non-antisemetic lense. Ok, really now the bible should not have to be read with a lense of anything. We are supposed to study the meaning of the text through it's historical and theological backgrounds not through some special lense."
5,Campoli the Great,"Alfredo Campoli was one of the outstanding violin masters of the 20th century. His tone was rich and sweet. His technique flawless. It is a treat to hear him in these classical pieces, asa well as in the lighter fare he recorded with his salon orchestra of the 1930's."
1,Disappointing transfer/production values,"I failed to get WHAT WAS ADVERTISED as being the Tartini ""Devil's Trill"" sonata, which amazed me. It is not that famous sonata but a different one included here, misnamed. Second, the transfers seemed to me to be a mite dimmer than expected. Allowing for the problem with attribution of the Tartini, however, the performances are all very good."
3,Just Plain Bizarre,"Man with a Squirrel is one of the most bizarre mysteries I've ever read. I commend it to all of those who find themselves attracted to weirdness.Someone is carving up and selling off crude sections of a valuable painting. How can Fred Taylor find the rest and arrange for the painting to be restored?That would have been plenty bizarre enough, but Mr. Kilmer also populates this story with enough weird characters to fill a small asylum. If you enjoy reading about those who deal with suppressed memories of sexual molestation in their own families, you may like this book better than I did. I graded the book as though you have such a taste.As for me, I wouldn't have finished the book except that I enjoyed two other books in the Fred Taylor series.I'm hoping the next one I read won't be quite so disgusting in its exploration of depraved people."
3,"Didn't blow me away, but I enjoyed it.","Kilmer has a very interesting style. There is humor in his turn of phrase, but you must pay attention or you might miss it. While the first book might have given me a greater history of the characters, Kilmer did fill that in as the story progressed. The dialogue is well done; the sense of place could have been stronger. I did enjoy the book; it did keep me reading and it did have an excellent climatic scene. Although it isn't a ""wow"" book for me, I liked it and would read another book by Kilmer."
5,gaither vocal band,"I am a gaither vocal band fan. I love how they harmonize together. It's like being at church and worshipping at home. I recommend them to anyone, especially if you feel the singing at church is a little slow and traditional, these guys do a great job at lifting you up in an even more special way. But I do recommend you going to church and being around other believer's in our Lord for fellowship."
3,GVB DVD,"I love the music by the Gaither Vocal Band. It is the reason that I became a Christian a few months ago. However, the DVD quality is poor. It is difficult to navigate between chapters and sometimes when putting it in the DDV player closed captioning appears,even though you did not choose to have it. I have a more recent DVD, ""The Best of David Phelps"", and I have no issues with that. If you are going to charge that much for a DVD it should work properly."
3,Monty Python meets Zooblie Zoo,"As I watched the movie, I had this feeling that I was watching Zooblie Zoo and Monty Python at the same time. The costumes were pretty bad, for example, Terry Jones was just painted green basically in his portrayal of Toad, and I kept thinking of his Python sketch, ""croonchy frogs"" whenever he appeared to do something really goofy, (like dance.) The acting and special effects in it were great, however, and the movie kept pretty much to the original story line. When it was changed, it was done in such a way that it didn't hamper the plot.With it's semi-distracting over use of Monty Python characters, so-so songs, and poor costuming, I'd strongly suggest renting before buying."
2,the song,"The only good part in the movie is the villian song other then that,it stinks. I give this movie a 2 out of 10."
3,In praise of friendship,"Disney knows talking animals, and ""Mr. Toad"" gives us memorable characters, a good story, neat special effects, pleasing music (with dance), expert execution, and an entertaining demonstration of the value of friendship.Why only three stars? Because my wife and I found it too heavily loaded with threats and violence (comic violence, to be sure). But children of the age which loves to crash toy trucks into walls of blocks, may love it.No, I haven't read the book."
1,More for the children (grades prek-2) ...,"Many people enjoy this movie, but ... it's not at all as great as people say. The story has a very juvenile theme and if you have young children I would recommend this movie to you (even though it's rated PG), but ... don't sit in front of it too long though. Your children outgrow Mr. Toad's Wild Ride; we are now on to Prince of Egypt."
2,Forgettable,This is a nauseating film at the very least. It was totally ridiculous. Stick with the classic Walt Disney animated version. It is far superior and in the true spirit of the tale. Animals did a lot better in the original than the humans do here!
5,Simply Awesome,"One bass, one horn, two EXCELLENT musicians. You can tell these two were having loads of fun during this performance. For me this is a mind boggling album.For the $7 used price on this do not hesitate, buy it!!"
1,Do NOT buy! lost all in 2 mos,"After having it for 2 mos, it just stopped working without any damage or surge occuring to it! All of our pictures and comp. programs were on it. Customer svc. said sorry,""if the red light comes on that means it has died"". They said they'd send us a new one, but who wants to trust that product again with your valuables and memories!"
1,Do Not Buy This Product!,I am a photographer and I purchased this device to store my pictures and portfolio on it worked fine for a couple of months and then just crashed one day. I lost everything and there is no hope of getting it back. Dont waste your money!
2,It worked great for a while,"I loved this little thing in the months after I bought it... I would hook it up to my PC and save things on it, and then when I needed to take my laptop somewhere, I could just take it with me and have everything I needed. It doesn't need external power. HOWEVER, something went wrong with it before I had even had it a year. I plug it in and the computer won't even recoginize it. A friend said that it might be a power issue, so I bought an external power adapter, and plugged it in, and the thing shorted out my laptop for a while... talk about giving me a heart attack. Luckily the laptop started working after a couple minutes. I know the hard drive part is okay, as I was able to see some files before it shorted out the laptop... so I'm going to tear it apart and plug the hard drive into the computer with an adapter to at least get the data off. I emailed the support on their website and got nothing back."
1,Untrustworthy Backup,"At first I loved my new storage device, looks nice, easy to use. Then one day it stopped working. I had ALL my photos and videos on here. I have had it to several people trying to recover data with no luck. I have emailed costumer service several times with zero response. Can't even tell you how sad it is to lose your most precious memories using a system that is supposed to protect them and nobody even cares enough to respond. Won't buy Simpletech products again since they don't seem to stand by what they sell."
1,Not what I was looking for.,"I don't know if I misunderstood this product or what. My impression was that it would gradually color your lashes with daily use. Well I've been using it and haven't noticed a darn thing. Oh, except that I don't like it as just a mascara either. Hmmmmm."
1,The Essential Lab is proof: you get what you pay for,"The book is small, mainly pictures of lab puppies and, for some reason a few full pages of huskies? As far as advice on how to take care of the breed, it's as generic as they come. This is the only lab book I have purchased since getting my puppy, but I can not recommend it. My last dog was a Golden Retriever and this could have been written about that breed (or huskies for that matter). Sorry I don't know of a book I can recommend, but I just didn't want you to order this and be disappointed.Incidently, when I called to find out about returning the book, the Amazon representative recommended I write this review. Although it's a ""dot com"", Amazon still has very good LIVE customer service."
4,A cute hands on game,"If you're wary of too much kid vs. computer interaction, this is a good item for pre-school cognitive development. The much-often-ignored aspect of human interaction can be realized with this type of game. Also, Scooby-Doo is an icon that most children love.The game itself is just what it is.....pictures on average cards. Recommended for personal use at home but probably would not hold up in a preschool educational setting or daycare center."
5,Scooby Doo Match Game,It was received on a very timely manner - I actually received it faster than I thought. My daughter loves it. Was in the condition it was supposed to be in as well.
4,Very Good Product,"I bought this product to increase my gas mileage, it give the engine more horse power and allows you to consume more gas due to the power. As long as you keep your foot out of it, it does help gas mileage."
5,Here's The Answer - One of her best albums!,"It took a while before I could finally make a copy my own. Being a fan its quite frustrating and hard to believe that this disc is no longer in production.I'm sure that it still would sell. Skeeter has so many fans worldwide that it, in my opinion, could still sell for years!Now many (fans and others) cannot enjoy (unless you are prepared to pay a lot for a used CD) this outstanding album with masterpieces sung by this lovely lady and some of the best country singers of all time!If you are (even a tiny bit) willing to pay that high price for a used CD however, I'd say: do it, this is one mighty album you don't want to miss in your collection."
4,Melodious tunes for two,Excellent memories are in this. I love the songs. They bring back memories of those days tunes and lovers songs.
1,Nicht zehr gut.,"Cake was VERY dry and had no ""uniqueness"" about it. I think a standard Meijer cake would have been better. Probably best to visit the Sacher inn in Austria."
5,AMAZING!,"Bo is amazing!... he has an incredible voice, vehicle is his best track, is really great.Richie Sambora in the guitars with Bo make a great team!"
5,In Your Heaven...Heavenly,"I happen to love Bo's rendition of this song. The arrangement has been changed from the original, and Bo's voice gives it a bit of an edge. The song itself is lovely, but Bo's style really makes it enjoyable to listen to. I'd recommend it it highly."
3,Bo delivers,"I'm not a fan of the song ""Inside Your Heaven,"" and I was underwhelmed with the overprocessed ""Vehicle,"" but Bo delivers on this disc, as always. I'm looking forward to his full-length album."
2,NOT A GOOD CD,"I WAS ROOTING FOR BO TO WIN, BUT THIS CD IS NOT GOOD. I HAVE BOTH CARRIE UNDERWOODS CD AND BO CD AND CARRIES IS THE BEST BY FAR. THE VOCALS ON THIS CD JUST WERE NOT THAT GREAT. POOR WORK IN THE STUDIO. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!"
1,IYH-Boring Vehicle- Annoying,I'm sorry but these songs are quite boring and annoying to listen to. Bo doesn't even sound like he's into these songs while singing them. I hope he does better than this or he's just going to be another flash in the pan.
1,Poorly Done,Bo Bice's time in the limelight should be up after releasing this single. It's very poorly done. He sounds like all the other wantabes.
1,Very Generic and Boring..,"Inside your Heaven was a song written for a female singer Bo sounds like he wants the song to be over the whole time he is singing. As far as Vehicle goes, I saw the Ides of March perform this song when I was a teenager, Bo can't even come close..His vehicle broke down...."
1,Bo's Vehicle is Out of Gas..,What is up here?????? He sounds very tired on both songs. I think Bo Bice's voice is nice to some extent but I wouldn't bother purchasing this CD. This is my honest opinion. I don't think this guy has that much talent. Sorry.
5,Now THIS is an entertainer,"I'm still amazed Bo did not win the Idol crown; however, he is the American Idol as far as I'm concerned. His version of ""Inside Your Heaven"" is far superior to Carrie's. Bo sings on key and has a nice tone. He doesn't have to scream to hit the high notes: they come naturally.Bo's ""Vehicle"" is a great re-make, and he sings it comfortably and with feeling. Bo doesn't sound like someone who has memorized words and notes. He puts his heart into his voice, and THAT is entertainment."
4,A Teaser,"I enjoyed this CD for what it is, a teaser and can't wait to see more things from Bo. He kept my interest in American Idol, a show I've never paid much attention to before, I know I'm going to enjoy what he has to offer us next."
5,The most wonderful single ever!!,"Wow! What losers you guys are to give him 1 star. He's really awesome, i'm sorry that he's better than you and you're jealous.. you'll just have to get over it. Anyway, this single is really good, both songs are perfect evidence of why he should have won over the boring ""pseudo -idol"" Carrie Overstick *yawn* Bo... is way better. BUY HIS SINGLE!"
3,Bo forced to do INSIDE YOUR HEAVEN,"I'm sorry, but INSIDE YOUR HEAVEN is a terrible song. These tunes that the American Idol folks come up with at the last minute for the two finalists to sing. This song was written to the strengths of Carrie Underwood, and her version is a little more tolerable. However, it's a bad song with bad lyrics. Bo sings it about as well as he can..but it isn't his style, and it doesn't feel entirely comfortable.On the other hand, VEHICLE is right up his alley, and he tears into it pretty well. It still feels a bit sanitized, as though the IDOL producers just couldn't resist making it glossy. But this is Bo's strength, and it is listenable. It's never been my favorite song, but it's certainly time someone on IDOL got to rock a little bit.The single is strictly for Idol / Bo fans. NOT for someone looking for a great piece of music."
2,Oh dear!,"I'm sad to say I was very disappointed with the production of this cd. If you saw the American Idol series, you will be familiar with the way Bo belted out his rock songs with soul. Bo in this cd sounds like he is in a straight jacket, very restrained and contrived. Admittedly, I wasn't a big fan of ""Inside your Heaven"" and it sounds pretty awful on this cd.And ""Vehicle"" is average. None of the original rock"
2,The best is yet to come,"[...] I don't like the A side of this CD at all. I guess I've heard the Winners version so many times now it's just not the same. The B side however I like. I have the B side in my IPOD. I would give the B side a 4 star rating but the A sides a no show for me personally. If Bo had done SHA for the A side, now that would have been awesome!. Sense I'm being honest, being that I don't like the A side I would have to give this a 2.5 star rating. I'm looking forward to his fall release because the man can sing!"
5,Powerful,"Inside Your Heaven--Who knew I could like a song that sounded so sappy the first time I heard it performed (NOT by Bo). He made me love this song with his powerful vocals and emotion. This singer has soul that has won him millions of fans and will earn him millions more. His tone is true, clear and spot on!Vehicle--This may be the ""B"" side, but it gets an A from me. This is my favorite on the CD. Consistently powerful vocals with right on pitch and tone. This song really rocks! Richie Sambor picked a winner when he agreed to perform on this song. His guitar work is flawless and matches perfectly with the flawless vocals.Don't buy one! Buy three!!You'll need one for the car, home and work!!"
5,"Exemplary voice, superb attitude; personality","Bo has somethin going on.. everything about him is superb. He can sing pretty much anything well, and it would sound good. Inside your heaven , my daughters favorite, is a great listen.. very relaxing. Vehicle seems to be liked by most of us here at home. I am buying several of his singles to give away as gifts!"
5,Bo Rocks,"Bo Bice's ""Vehicle"" is awesome and rocks! Richie Sambora's guitar adds to the spectacular sound of this CD. ""Inside Your Heaven"" is great. I highly recommend this CD to anyone!"
5,Fan of Both Idols,"While I'm a fan of both versions of this song, I prefer Bo's version much better. As expected his version has a rock angle, while Carrie's has the expected country angle. This version adds some reverb behind Bo's voice and it really works good. Also, I'm not sure about the band that was chosen to back Bo for this single, I think it would have been interesting to hear his real band backing him up. Maybe we'll get that in the future."
5,AWESOME VOCALS,"Bo Bice takes what IMHO are subpar lyrics (Inside your Heaven), and makes it enjoyable to listen to just for the fact that his voice is so dmned AMAZING. He has true SOUL in his voice; a rare quality -- and he could sing just about any genre and pull it off. He does a great job with both songs and I'm looking forward to seeing what he does on an entire ALBUM. More importantly, I'm looking forward to seeing what we can expect from Mr. Bice when his AI contract is up and he's free to do the songs HE wants to do!"
5,Inside Your Heaven/Vehicle,"The deep, soulful voice of Bo Bice has awakened the music within me. His rendition of Inside Your Heaven touches the heart and leaves a lasting memory. Bravo Mr. Bice---job well done!!!"
5,A breathe of fresh air,"The CD is amazing, he makes a poorly written song fantastic! As good if not better than his Sugar Money stuff."
5,Bo's CD is Spectacular,"I hope that this single is a good preview of what's to come on Bo Bice's album. Inside Your Heaven may have been written with Carrie Underwood in mind, but Bo gives it life. (Maybe it's a little over produced, but I'll look over that.) Bo's voice and Richie Sanbora's guitar are a great match on Vehicle.I can't wait to hear some ""southern rock"" from this guy."
5,Bo Bice - Interesting New Musician,"This single is just a taste of an interesting new musician. I am looking forward to his full length CD. Bo Bice demonstrates real passion for his music and turns the AI tune into something more than their usual sappy ballad. The ""Vehicle"" remake is really something to listen to with Richie Sambora joining in. A single definitely worth purchasing."
4,Just a perfect teaser for what's to come,"I gave the CD a 4 instead of 5 because ""Inside Your Heaven"" is a travesty foisted on both artists forced to include it. That said, Bo does a great job trying to infuse an absolutely horrific song with some passion. Aside from whatever the lyrics are supposed to mean, Bo doesn't try to overimbue the song with gravitas it doesn't have. As Farmer Hoggett would say, ""That will do, Bo, that will do.""But Vehicle? Oh man, Vehicle. It is pure Bo Bice, and what I'm expecting a full CD of in the Fall. I agree you can't listen to the song without a full-size grin on your face. It is FABULOUS! And Sambora gives it the modern feeling it needed. If Vehicle doesn't get airplay, it won't be the artists' or musicians' fault.If you've never heard Bo Bice and wonder if there is any fuss to be made, my advice is to sample Inside Your Heaven, but listen (and dance) to Vehicle. And you'll get it."
2,Bo's new single,I received the single today and it was incredible. As colorful and soulful his voice comes across on the television--it is even more so on the recording. Really well done! And Carrie Underwood is credited for backup vocals for Vehicle! It's definitely a must have!
2,Alright But Lacking,"I give this a 2 stars because the songs are sort of boring, however Bo does sound ok in them. I think he'll do better when he's able to pick better songs."
3,"Bo- Ok, not outstanding","Though I have always been a Carrie fan, I do give Bo his own fair chance. He did not do terrible, but his rendition of ""Heaven"" was just bad compared to Carrie's. Though I do think he did better in ""Vehicle"". It could have been better but I still enjoyed that one. I would give Bo one star for ""Heaven"" but four for ""Vehicle"" so overall, I give him a 3 stars."
2,Ok.,"Sounds ok but I guess I got so use to hearing a different type of voice sing the song that now when I hear Bo's version it's just OK. It is nice to hear a male version however. Never been a fan of the song ""Vehicle""-- so no comment there."
5,Step Aboard Bo's Vehicle and Get Inside His Heaven,"While Inside Your Heaven may not seem like it was made for a rock singer like Bo, he takes this song and makes it unique and credible. A song this bad would sound bad on a sappy ballad singer, but Bo makes it sound good. Vehicle is a rocking great tune. I hope it's on his full album. Richie Sambora adds a bit of his own flavor. Carrie Underwood does the backup vocals. If the whole country thing doesn't work out, Carrie can definitely make it as a backup singer."
5,Stunning,"Bo's voice is stunningly alive, with manlyness. The tone is just right, and it isn't squeaky screamy like some people *cough cough* Vehicle was an amazing performance on AI, and it will surely go down as one of the best performances. This polished version is a pleasure to hear."
5,BO'S NUMBER 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS CD WILL CEMENT BO BICE AS AN INSTANT #1 ACT IN THE POP-ROCK WORLD!! IT IS TRULY HIS ""VEHICLE"" TO STARDOM AFTER ALL HIS YEARS OF PERFORMING. BO'S VOICE HAS THE EDGE THAT IT TAKES TO BE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED; I CAN'T WAIT FOR HIS UPCOMING CD IN THE FALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Bo Bice: The New King of Southern Rock,"[...]For your listening pleasure, here is the mellow side of Bo with ""Inside Your Heaven"" and the incredible remake of ""Vehicle"". All I can say is ""Yow-za!"" Enough of the tease, now bring on the goods!!! This ride can only get better!!"
2,Expecting better for Bo's debut.,"I loved Bo. He was my 2nd favorite ""American Idol 4"" contestant- but these songs just do not fit him, especially ""Inside Your Heaven"". ""Vehicle"" is a tad better, but it was not as good as his ""American Idol"" performance. ""Inside Your Heavem"" is a song suited more for Carrie, but not Bo! I am expecting better for Bo's debut album since he will have a little more say in what will be on his CD. I was expecting better from ""Vehicle"" on this CD, but I knew ""Inside Your Heaven"" just wasnt Bo's type since I heard Carrie sing it on the ""American Idol 4"" finale. I wish they would have done with Bo Bice what they had done for Diana DeGarmo on ""American Idol 3""- givin him a better-suited song to record."
5,A Great Start,"Bo Bice is an excellent singer and his single ""Inside Your Heaven/Vehicle"" is the perfect example of why. This guy is mad talented. It is no exageration. He's exactly what the music industry needs right now. Bo Bice is no tired and old formula. He's refreshing and exciting.I voted for Bo on American Idol because his vocal mastery is undeniable. And he commands that stage and keeps your attention. While ""Inside Your Heaven"" may not be the most enlightning musical track, Bo makes it worth the listen each time. Meanwhile, ""Vehicle"" was one of Bo's signature songs from the show. And the addition of Richie Sambora on guitar takes it to another level.Bo Bice can make almost any song sound like a classic. I'm so glad he's getting the opportuiny to record an album. I am looking forward to years of many great Bo Bice recordings. I can't wait to see him in concert. I would definitely recommend this CD."
2,The Riddle .....Still left Wondering,"What a disappointment . After reading one of Milton's other books I was excited to get this for Xmas. The book is a soft introduction to some of the history of both the Middle Ages, the Middle East, but thats it . I felt that the author had stumbled onto a possible winner but in the end it didnt pan out but had to publish a book to justify his travels ( and perhaps his advance ). Best I can say about the book is the bibliography. This alone was worth one star , otherwise I would have only given a rating of one star. Not a recommended buy"
5,classic,This is the classic book about classic boats. I bought it because of my interest in one particular boat and ended up reading it cover to cover. The author put together a large part of the Smithsonian's collection of boat plans and definitely knew his stuff. This is a great book if you are interested in a particular type of historic boat. It is also worth reading just to compare the relative merits of different designs. The lines and offsets given for the many of boats are enough to build from.
4,Classic Live Caravan,"This Caravan classic found the band joined by the New Symphonia for a one night only performance of material from their new (in 1974)album FOR GIRLS WHO GROW PLUMP IN THE NIGHT and several standards, such as FOR RICHARD. As this CD shows, Caravan was one of those rare bands that sounds very good in an orchestral setting."
3,OEM replacement,"This was purchased for a 2001 Qx4, rear shocks.I was looking to upgrade my suspension to be a little more stiff. When inspecting these shocks, I noticed that it was relatively easy to compress these shocks. I interpreted that as soft dampening capability by these shocks. However, after having exchanged these shocks with the KYB monotube Gas-A-Just shocks, I think these would have sufficed, as I also upgraded my coil springs all around to some stiffer coils. All these shocks would really do is just prevent my truck from bouncing all over the place and I believe these shocks would have been able to do that just fine. The ride with the Gas-A-just equivalent shocks seem a little too stiff, but tolerable. I can't say for sure if these GR-2 shocks would have made for a bit more softer ride, but I wouldn't doubt that they'd function just fine with me new stiffer coils.As KYB advertises, I agree that these are good OEM replacements to the shocks that came from Nissan/Infiniti factory."
4,Pretty nice,"I saw James Bryan open for K-os at a Vancouver show in July. I must say, I was impressed. The album sound is difficult to describe, it is sort of a mix of merengue, dance, and soul. It has a nice summer sound, and is great for playing while just relaxing in the sun. Having said that, I heard from a credible source (James Bryan) that the Philosopher Kings will be doing a new album soon, so I am definitely excited."
4,un gran e ignorado cantante,"al escuchar las canciones uno se pregunta por què Lico nunca alcansò la fama que le pertenecìa. Pero el disco es bueno, excepto en un par de canciones en que se pierde el volumen, y vale la pena tenerlo."
3,Not who you think it is,"I bought this book thinking it was about the Patanjali considered by most Yoga people to be the compiler of the Yoga Sutra, who lived in the second century CE. But alas, it's about Patanjali the grammarian (sometimes identified with the other Patanjali), who lived a few hundred years earlier. It's a good book, just not the one I expected it to be."
4,great but a little redundant,"It is good to see this album back in print, because Danielle Dax makes excellent music, and most of it is unavailable in stores. But all of the tracks on this CD except for one (""Born to Be Bad"") also appear on her 1988 release ""Dark Adapted Eye"", which also features 9 additional songs. Although Danielle's releases on the Sire label appear to be out of print at the moment, if you have made it this far, it should be easy enough for you to click over to ""Dark Adapted Eye"" and purchase an inexpensive used copy, rather than paying import prices for this little gem."
3,3.5 Stars and an Asteroid: Pretty & Strange,"This is funky and sophisticated yet this is not Goth music and why someone would put this in that dategory, I do not know. The good thing is that this does not fit into any catagory except New Wave perhaps but there is a country tinge that makes it tweaky freaky. It is strage and yes it is pretty. You can dance to it, it has a good beat and original all at once. I wonder what ever happened to this artist. Seek and find."
4,this game is great,"This is classic Monopoly with the Boston Red Sox flare. Board Walk has been replaced by Fenway and Park Place by Ted Williams. It's so cool, and any boston fan will love it."
2,Just okay if you're not a huge Journey fan,"This isn't a live concert CD. It's a collection of live performances. So it doesn't feel like a concert. (Compare to Aerosmith's live album ""South of Sanity"" where you feel like you are in the arena.) With this Journey album, the Producers hand picked the ""best"" live performances from several concerts. So it should be flawless, but it just isn't. For me, I'm not a big fan of Steve Perry's habit of trying to get the crowd to sing along. Take a hint from Aerosmith or Bryan Adams, you don't ask the crowd to sing along, they'll do it when they want to. My recommendation: stick to the Studio Greatest Hits to satisfy your Journey fix."
1,"Like, gag me with a spoon!","I was in a bar not too long ago and a cover band was playing a Journey song. ""Oh my God, who plays Journey these days?!"" say I, incredulously, not quite believing such a thing could be possible (or allowed) in 1999. This neanderthal refugee from a trailer park next to me says, ""Hey, I like Journey!"" Oh well, inbreeding will tell...This CD is all things vile and contemptible about corporate ""rock"" and waxes eloquently, without intending to, on why punk was so necessary. Not only that, it sounded worse than the cover band!"
3,not a bad listen,"Being a die hard Neal Schon fan, I bought the CD. Overall, if you like live music and you like Journey, you'll like it. Personally, after about 5 or six songs Steve Perry's shrill toned vocals started to grate on my ears. The mixing is OK, but I think his vocals could come down a notch or two. Neal, of course, wails but I was a little disappointed that he rarely expanded his solos. They are all pretty much note-for-note from the original, which is OK, but I hoped for some improv. Not bad overall, but not really essential."
5,All the emotion and power of live Journey captured on a CD,"Journey live is an awesome music experience. From Schon's fiery guitar on ""Don't Stop Believin'"" to Perry's silky tenor on ""Lights/Stay Awhile"", Journey live is so different from Journey in the studio. It's almost as if you can feel their dedication to their fans and the love of their music just through a CD."
3,Seems a little off,"Something seemed a little off with the live version of these songs. I think it was the way it was produced. I am purchasing the two CD greatest hits instead, and hoping for better results."
2,Live????,"When I buy a live cd, I want the feeling of a concert otherwise, just buy the greatest hits. I was extremely disappointed in this one. I should of known better looking at the track listing. Would Journey ever open with Don't Stop Believin? Most of the tracks sound like they were recorded in the studio with crowded noise pumped in at the beginning of the song and the live crowd comes back at the end....some songs fade like a studio recording. These tracks have been stripped of the live feel. You know when you listen to a studio cd, the space between tracks? That his here also. No flow what-so-ever. Seriously buy Captured instead of this one (love that cd). Or even the Escape Tour cd. How can this cd get 4 and a half stars?"
3,A befitting title,"I have purchased this CD more than once and to my consternation have it ""misplaced"". I am going to buy it again because this cd is a must have to any serious jazz fan's collection. If you are not a jazz fan, listen to this cd and you will become one!"
1,2 speed not 3 speed,"the book say it plays 45, 33, and78 but the instruction book as well as the unit are only 33, and 45 the want to be able to 78's"
3,Crazy Crown Box 2009 Edition,"Pressman Toy Corporation has repackaged the ""Blockhead!"" game in a colorful flip top box that resembles the crazy crown block. It differs from the previous edition (1996) in that it now features a wooden base instead of the orange card stock base. The 20 wooden blocks are painted in vibrant green, yellow, red, orange, and dark blue. One of the tall bridge blocks has been replaced with a basic rectangle block. The grooves on the two bridge blocks are more shallow but still fit the large and small roller blocks. There seems to be better quality control employed in the overall finish of these blocks. No Spanish game instructions. I would like to see Pressman reissue a retro version of this game featuring the 25 blocks in the same dimensions and colors as the Saalfield Publishing Company classic square box edition from 1954."
5,Blockhead,"This is a perennial favorite, great for kids and grownups alike. I bought it for my kids when they were young and recently bought it for my grandchildren. It's fun solo and with other participants."
2,Disappointed,"Had this game as a child, over 60 now, and purchased it for our granddaughter. The pieces are much smaller now making it very difficult,thus not much fun, for younger children. Even adults who remember playing this game are not impressed with this ""new"" one."
4,My Granddaughters love it,"I had played Blockhead many years ago and enjoyed it. I looked at other versions of it and decided to try this one. I have not been disappointed.It seems to be as good as the original and I have played it with my beautiful Granddaughters many times. They like it too, it's simple to do and I think they appreciate not having to be studied experts to be able to play the game.As far as being educational, I don't really think it has much educational value, maybe they learn a little about balance but mainly it's just simple fun.It's a good product, decently well made and is fun to use with the kids."
1,Buyer Beware,"I expected the entire book not just one author with information available for free on the internet, definitely not worth $3.10."
4,More Than Entertaining - Solid Gospel Music,"Another in the Gaither Gospel Series with Bill, Gloria and their ""Homecoming Friends."" ""What a Time"" featured some of my favorites: ""Rise Again"" sung by Ivan Parker, a piano medley featuring Anthony ""Great is Thy Faithfullness"" ""Howe Big is God"" and ""How Great Thou Art,"" and ""No Tears in Heaven"" as sung by James Blackwood.I also enjoyed a special testimony by Mark Lowry. Another great concert."
3,"""okay""","My son (7 years old) loves connect four, so I thought he'd enjoy this also. Wrong. We both got tired of it very quickly. The challenge wasn't there. Maybe better for younger users?"
5,Quality Power Washer Quick Connector,This brass quick connector is great. The plastic quick connectors that come with many power washers break very quickly. This connector is solid brass and can take the stress of your garden hose pulling on the connector without breaking it like the cheap plastic ones. I love this thing! No more water supply hose popping loose from my power washer while in the middle of a project spraying water everywhere I don't want it.
1,leaks and not able to make a tight seal,"I ordered this item recently to simplify the hookup of our pressure washer and other water based gardening tools and hoped that it provides a solid connection. Sadly it turned out to be leaking none stop and be basically useless.I replaced all the washer's in the hope to get it to seal, but to no available.Highly dissatisfied"
3,"works okay, but still leaking","I was told to buy this product to go along with my new power washer as the coupling on it tended to leak. This quick connect makes it easier to connect the hose to the power washer, but I am still getting some leaking. I am going to try to use some other kind of washer or tape to see if that will correct the problem. Definitely do like the ease of connection."
3,Why so much?,"I use these fittings on most of my hose attachments and like them. However, I pay about $2.00 a piece at Home Depot.."
2,Too much fuzack!,"Wayne Krantz is an exceptional talent and the solo pieces on this CD are first rate. But the tracks with the band just reek of the hell that is smooth jazz. ""Two Drink Minimum"" is a much better choice for the uninitiated."
4,board game,My girls love the Wild Kratts and loves to see Martin and Chris in their younger years on Zoboomafoo. A wonderful game.
3,Not as fun as it looked,"This looked like it would be a lot of fun for tweens, but was a disappointment. The scents weren't bad and the kit does encourage creativity. However, it was very messy and hard to mix the lotions to the proper consistency. This was one of those things that was used once, then put away in the bottom of the closet and never taken out again."
3,Son enjoys it but poor quality materials,"The game concept is really very good. My 5-year old enjoys playing the game and it moves quickly enough that no one gets bored or tired before finishing. Each game only lasts 10-15 minutes depending upon number of players. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the game board and pieces. The game board is only slightly heavier than card stock and as a result does not lay flat which is pretty annoying. Unfortunately most of the ""Scooby-Doo"" items we have purchased have had similar quality issues which is a shame."
4,Very nice espresso cup and saucer,This is a very nice little demi-tasse cup and saucer. It is perfect for a double shot cappuccino. It was not packaged very well and the first saucer had to be returned because it was broken. Amazion replaced it very quickly.
1,This is one of the most boring movies,"I bought this as part of the 8-movie Midnight Horror pack. At $5, it was way over-priced. FROZEN IN FEAR, or THE FLYING DUTCHMAN, is exceptionally boring, insipid, and just a mess. The back-story is told through a series of flashbacks that tell us nothing about the main character. The relationships between characters is never clarified; and, the ""surprise"" twists are so predictable there are no surprises. Avoid this one, regardless of cost."
2,Badly used potential,"Watching this, I spontaneously thought that with a touch here, a touch there it might have become much better. It's a run off the mill story about a crazy artist with a traumatic past who lives an isolated life and may or may not be dangerous. The actors do the best they can but do not really save it. The set design is not bad and I found the artist's work on display quite interesting."
4,Great product,Great product. I take the capsules to help ease anxiety. It helps a lot. A natural way to soothe feelings.
4,Little extra energy,At 71 I am still working doing outside work involved in planting restoration area for fish habitat. Very strenuous work! I take on capsule about mid day and it seems to carry me through the afternoon.
1,Not what I was looking for,"I tried this product after seeing a youtube video of a women talking about how the product helped her with PMS and cramping after using it the product just did not agree with me it made my body temperature rise, later found out after researching this product its to help with your sex drive this product did not nothing for my sex drive or PMS it was a waste for me but maybe it will work for you."
1,Be prepared for extreme hairloss and worse,"Thought this product was alright till my perfect hair started to fall out, stomach pains head aches and anxiety. They dont even mention the horrible effects of this product they hide them."
3,No noticeable results,I had read the benefits of Maca Root. I have not been able to notice any of the desired results in the three weeks I've been using it.
4,Good deal,Maca root is useful to enhance virility and help man to keep energetic. I will keep on purchasing such that deals. Thanks so much!
2,beware!!!,this stuff makes you gain weight....lots of weight! it does give you energy but it puts pounds on your arms legs and thighs...hard to lose.
1,Disappointing,I had been purchasing Macafem for ~$30 a bottle and was looking for some cheaper alternatives. Based on all the positive reviews this supplement received I was super excited to try it and also was delighted by the surprisingly low price. In this case I received exactly what I paid for. The effects are nothing in comparison and it leaves a horrible aftertaste.
5,Good idea. You'll be glad you did.,"So far, so good. I won't go into TMI detail, but I'm dang glad I found Maca and then this particular product, because it's so reasonably priced, and seems to be doing the trick. If you know what I mean."
2,This was not what i wanted,"Ok so i bought this product but when i got it it was the dietary supplements which isn't what i wanted i wanted the herb , are they the same as the herbal supplements , it came in a different shaped bottle as well . can SOME ONE PLEASE HELP ME . !!!!!!! DID THIS HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSEE . ?????"
2,It might work...but yuck,Took two and they were nasty! If you do not mind the taste then ignore me and move on to another review...if you are funny about it though....look for something else.
2,Bigger T*tties,"1st of all eat before taking product or you will feel sick2nd of all your breast will grow just after 2 weeks, which I do not like3rd of all will not increase but-tock size just breast size4th of all product do work,and I will not purchase again"
2,Product description lacking detail,"I've heard great things and was excited to try Maca. What concerns me is that vitamin E is listed as an ingredient in this product, but the amount is left off of the label. If you are like me and take other vitamin supplements as well, you need to make sure you aren't over doing it on some areas. Since I have no way of knowing how much vitamin E is in this product, I feel uncomfortable taking it with my other multivitamins. High doses of vitamin E are not good for you. It wouldn't have taken the company much work to fix this inconsistency, but I won't buy this product again unless it's properly labelled. It's cheaper than other brands, but I'll pay a little more in the future to not have to worry."
1,bad side affect,"wouldn't purchas it agiandidn't have any good point, it cause me to gain 15 lb within to weeksms.k from okchoma city"
5,excellent product,This was a difficult cd to find. How fortunate I am to have found it on amazon. It is in excellent condition!
5,PRAISE THE LORD WITH THIS ONE!,Praise the Lord and rock with some great music. Many of the best PK songs! Worth every cent of your money for the messages on this album!
2,A perfectly painful film for your ears,"While I agree with the many positive reviews that this film is well-directed and shot, and engrossing in it's plot, it is also chock-full of weirdness. Cillian's bizarre hyper-exaggerated ""Cork"" accent made me want to reach into the screen and smack him at (many) points. This one aspect of the film alone ruins it for me. Perhaps the accent was chosen to make him seem more insane, but honestly, it made him seem more of a brutal dullard than anything else, which makes one wonder why Runt would have ever cared for his company in the first place.All in all, an interesting, but aggravating film to watch."
1,crap,"In my opinion this movie should win a award for the worst movie ever made. Pig and runt, what is this crap? Every movie needs to have a good story, without a good story it is just [...]. I am sure that i am not the only person that thinks this."
4,"Very disturbing film, wonderfully acted","I have rarely been more disturbed by a film than this one. The acting is amazing, and though the plot is a little slow at the beginning, I really got wrapped up in it after the first half hour. Watching the relationship between Pig and Runt evolve is like watching a train crash in slow motion: you know things will get bad, but you can't look away. The characters are so wonderfully acted, but even so, I don't think I'd see this movie again because it's so disquieting...a sign of a really good film that gets into your head!"
3,Bought it for the Kamen tracks...,"As others have already noted, it would have been nice if more of the series' original score music was included on this CD, but the track listing is there for anyone to see prior to purchase. I'm curious as to why there are a dozen reviews of this CD posted by one particular reviewer here ...what's the point of that?"
1,Ack!!,"Well, this is a disappointment. I was brought to rapt attention when I saw that the soundtrack was available on CD at the credit roll. I would expect a soundtrack album to contain the soundtrack of the memorable and stirring original compositions, not the incidental pop-oldies stuff.It's probably fitting and ironic in a way - these most stirring original themes are lost and trivialized in the backwash of pop-rehash. Just like the space program.Welcome to America in the 90's."
1,Big Disappointment!,"This was a great opportunity for the label and producer to record some of TV's greatest music from some of the best composers in the business. Composers who you rarely find on a disc. The scores of this epic series are outstanding. Kamen's main theme just carries the entire film, but on this recording it is wasted. The other ""songs"" from the 50's and 60's can be bought cheaper on other albums. But the musical score of this mini series won't be heard until an arranger writes it for the local high school band. Or, a Boston or Cincinnati Pop's album features a suite or the entire score, it was that good. A true attempt to rush a CD to market while the show was on the air. If the label had taken their time and recorded it the way it should have been, they would of made more money and sold more albums. Too bad!"
2,Taught me a lesson,Next time .. read the tracks before you buy it. I was fully expecting to hear Mason Daring and James Newton Howard instead got Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. If you want to hear these tracks purchase the Time-Life 60's anthology.
4,Original Score?,I keep checking under different headings and apparently they have not released the original score that was not the mishmash of 60's songs retreads. Does anyone know if they did release the original score? I can't seem to find it.
2,GRRRRR!,"Michael Kamen composes beautiful music - just listening to it makes me start to tear up! I like the oldies on the CD, but I'd like some more original compositions!"
2,This is not what I heard during the mini-series!,"If I wanted to listen to moldy-oldies, I would buy a 60s anthology! Where is the great soundtrack I heard on HBO? The moving strains of the theme repeated in minor key when the three astronauts tragically perished in the launch-pad fire? The endless permutations of excellence that saturated the whole 12 episodes? PLEASE! Release a true soundtrack of Kamen's artistry!"
3,not what i wanted,"wanted scores, not the oldies music ...excellent opportunity passed up ... give us the good stuff, not the old stuff"
5,Excellent Soundtrack,"Wonderful CD, that really brings you back to the series and the time that the Apollo events took place. Although the cd contains only two tracks from Michael Kamen (opening and ending theme) the cd is still absolutely worth buying. It would not however be such a bad idea to accompany the release of the Signature Edition of From The Earth to the Moon with a new soundtrack as well containing more of the brilliant music composed by Michael Kamen. Till then we just have to be satisfied with the two tracks on this cd."
1,Wait for the score...,"After recently watching (and often re-watching) my Earth to the Moon DVD set, I was immediately struck by how beautiful and appropriate the score was to the mini-series. It complemented the entire work very well.Too bad barely any of it was on the CD!If HBO doesn't release the score -- a complete orchestral score and not this mediocre excuse for a 60's music flashback -- I would be sorely disappointed. Do not purchase this CD if you're waiting to listen to the amazing work by the score's composers."
1,Doesn't even leave the ground!,"Some of the prettiest music I've heard on a soundtrack ever is played during this mini series. What were they thinking! The song played during the episode ""Spider"" when the LEM was completed is what made me go out and purchase this. The mixture of oboe, mandolin, clarinet and french horns we so wonderful with the repeating melody that I can hear the entire orchestration in my head note for note. Between that exclusion and so many others, I was so disappointed that I immediately gave it away. I can gather the songs online that they have on this CD all by myself so I can't think of any reason anyone in their right mind would bother buying this. If I could give this 2 negative stars, I would. This is just like a BLACK HOLE....don't let it suck you in!!!"
1,"...because ""No Stars"" was not an option...","It's been fairly well-stated already by the other reviewers here, but this was a wasted opportunity. Not only is it some of Michael Kamen's best work ever, but each individual segment of this outstanding mini-series was scored by a different composer, and NONE of that is here! Our only hope is that someday, someone (maybe Varese-Sarabande, as part of their ""Film Classics Series?) will see fit to release this score the way it SHOULD have been released."
1,What a Disappointment! Where's the Soundtrack?,Such a dramatic and beautiful score. Too bad it wasn't included on my CD
3,Disappointed... (stars are only For Michael Kamin),"It pays to not assume.... (read the fine print)I suppose its my own fault for assuming that the music on this CD was the SCORE not the SOUNDTRACK, terms that are often misused.The real selling point of the music for the Earth to the Moon Series, is of course, the SCORE. The ""throwins"" like the Byrds, and other 60's memorabilia, is not what a new CD should be about. I HAVE the 60's retro tracks in 12 other forms.. How about something NEW here.I am sure that Michael Kamin can rerelease his theme on another compilation of his own, but what about the other music.. How and when can we get to that? Maybe never. More shallow thinking from record companies."
1,What? No Score?,"Why on Earth didn't you include the original series score! I didn't want the oldies! I can get those on any other cd! What you need to do is go back and put out another cd with the original score(hopefully some producers of the series like, Mr Hanks , will read this. Yea, right!)"
2,Not what is should have been,"Of course I would simply be rehashing what the majority have been saying: This is not a soundtrack, but a collection of 60s tunes you can get off Limewire.I haven't found out yet why this only had Michael Kamen's main theme and closing theme and omitted Mason Daring's outstanding work for Spider or James Newton Howard's piece for Apollo 11.The two stars are for Michael Kamen (Rest in Peace). As for the rest of the music, I either own some of it or my Mom has it!Wait until the studio wises up and figures out how to release original music. Forget this disc."
2,Lagwagon has began to sound like Foo-Fighters,"I went into Best Buy hoping to buy a good new CD. I picked out Double Plaidnum because Lagwagon had proved to be great in their past releases. This album is catchy, but lacking the hard edge that Lagwagon had in Trashed."
4,Lagwagon-Double Plaidinum,"Lagwagon, one of the greats. This was my first Lagwagon album, when I initially got into them, several years ago. I will admit that this one might take some getting used to, however, give it the time it deserves and you will see what an outstanding punk album this is. Joey Cape and the crew have been putting out great stuff for years and ""Double Plaidinum"" was far from a let down. With the current state of what is considered ""punk"" these days it would be an excellent idea for all of those 14 year old MTV-ers to put down their Simple Plan and use their allowance for something worthwhile. Lagwagon would be a great place for them to start. But then again, I doubt any of them will stumble upon this review in their search for the newest tripe released by The All American Rejects.84/100"
3,needs work,"lagwagon is an all-around great band, but they did something wrong with this one. although there were a few good songs, the overall impression was just mediocre."
2,Weak!,I love Lagwagon but this ones got to go. Their three prior records were all excellent. This offering however is completely different. If you like the older Lagwagon-the stuff I like-don't bother with this one!
3,gooses review,"In comparison to other lagwagon cds this one is my least favorite. ""today"" is definatly the best song on the cd followed by ""alien 8"", ""One thing to live"", and barely cutting it ""Twenty seven"" making frineds and unfurnished are worth listening to once but the rest just dont cut it. If you really like lagwagon this should probably be the cd you get to complete your collection after getting the rest."
1,"Old book, useless",This is an old book. Poorly written and very little useful information. Waste of money. I would give it zero star rating if this was available.
5,Great picture!,"This was the only 37"" tv that would fit in our entertainment center, the others were at least an inch too wide. The picture is great, although we did have a hard time at first setting the aspect ratio. Everytime we switched to an HD channel we had to manually change the aspect. Now it does it automatically, I'm not sure why. It's great having all the different inputs, much easier than changing the channel to play DVD's."
5,Hard Core Punk Fun,"This song is the Louie, Louie of the 80's. Graphic, over the top, in your face, sexual degeneration. Lyrics like, ""She gives me head, it makes it worse, put your f### retainer back in your purse.."" You get the drift. Its raving driving blitzkrieg of non stop sound, that is until it ends. The flip side is kinda creepy late night 'The Shadow' dementia....play at your own risk."
3,going through the motions,"SLAVE EXODUS is the second novel of a trilogy dealing with human-like aliens who place human minds into almost-indestructible bodies. The ""science"" and ""science fiction"" aspect, understandably, is given short shrift given that this is an erotic novel. However, considering the fact that this novel deals with an S&M fetish, it was probably unwise to make these new host bodies very strong and give them a high pain threshold, vitiating much of the frisson that is de rigueur in S&M literature. Related to this is the fact that the captive humans (their minds, anyway, as their original bodies have been discarded) do not seem unduly distressed at their state of captivity. Not only that, there are just too many characters to keep track of. If this were a movie, it would be directed by Andrew Blake, or be some soft-focus soft-core movie on some cable channel."
2,2 stars + better than average for the genra,"Humanoid aliens are running a sex operation on remote Shetland islands (that's redundant) to get money for their operations. CID has become interested as one of their sergeants was killed on one of the islands. This is the second book of a series, the first was quite good. This one is kind of a digression from the main plot and while it does introduce several main characters its rather tangential to the rest of the series. Some BDSM, Ds (almost all fem dom) and some good erotic scenes (mostly female/female) and good character development. The stile is annoying as Pope chops the plot line into small scenes that are intended to be taken as occurring concurrently in time.Somewhat disappointing considering the strong first book in the series."
4,fascinating social treatise,"First of all, let me just say that I read this book several years ago, so it's not fresh in my memory, but when looking at some of the one star reviews here, I couldn't help but laugh at how some people can be so biased against a book that seemed to have offended them. I'll put it this way: if you need binoculars to see halfway to sociopolitical middle, you will be offended. This is absolutely NOT a one star book. It's well-written, insightful, and poinient--and I'm saying that as someone who considers himself left of center. I never at any time felt like I was being condescended to, as some of the reviews suggest. This is a good book, and you will look at our culture a little differently after having read it. I should also point at that a similar title on the growing trend of narcissism was written by a psychologist by the name of Jeanne Tweng, which came out at the same time this book did. Her book is a little more sour grapes, but it's a very good read as well."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Nothing is good enough for Niedzviecki. Like pop culture? You're a mindless drone. Invent your own culture (like filming your own backyard wrestling league)? You're a wanna-be who's just trying to be special when you aren't. Participate in a community by choice? You must be trying to surround yourself with people who value you so that you can soothe your need to be, you guessed it, special. According to him, the only way to be a decent person is to go live without electricity on an island in the middle of nowhere. Frankly, I wish Niedzviceki would practice what he preaches. Let him go live on an island somewhere - and stop publishing rude, insulting, condescending books that don't even make a coherent argument about what he expects a meaningful community to look like."
2,"Retread of Wolfe, Lasch, and Frank","The major line of thought in this book trace back to the 1960's and 1970's, including Tom Wolfe's ""The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby"", Chris Lasch's ""Culture of Narcissism"" and (more recently) Frank's ""Commodify Your Dissent."" The author doesn't mention or cite any of those works.Younger readers who are uninterested in history might enjoy the recent cultural examples in this book, but I find it's got very little new to say."
5,On the road . . .,"This wonderful little gem of a road movie follows three characters as they travel from a wide spot in the road on the vast, flat plains of Patagonia in southern Argentina to the port town of San Julián. Made almost entirely with nonprofessional actors, the film is a picaresque sequence of moments in the lives of simple people being their quirky selves. No big adventure or car chases, the story is driven so to speak by an old man's search for a dog, a young mother's appearance on a low-budget TV game show, and a traveling salesman's romantic efforts to impress a storekeeper with just the right birthday cake. If you like little movies about everyday life in its lighter, comic moments, you'll enjoy this one. The DVD includes an informative making-of featurette."
5,Nice Little Cutting Board,"This is a really nice little cutting board. It's just the right size for small jobs that you don't want to use a large cutting board for like slicing a tomato for a sandwiche or cutting cheese (I know how that sounds). Anyway, I am very happy with my purchase."
5,Love these! So convenient to use and wash,I cut small amounts of food all the time (having two toddlers) and own 2 of these cutting boards. I love how small they are--makes for easy grabbing and using with cutting small amounts of fruit veggies etc. I would highly recommend these to others and will be buying more in the future when needed!
3,School Book,I got this book because it is the text we are using in class. It is a collected work so it has a ton of Marx's works throughout the years.
1,THIS IS A COMPLETE RIP-OFF!!!,I am giving this a one-star only because I cannot give it zero. This book was supposed to be the Kindle edition of the paperback Marx Engels Reader. IT IS IN NO WAY RELATED!!! Amazon has known about this error for over a year and refuses to correct it. Shame on them.
1,Fraudulent Kindle Version,"The Kindle version being linked to is NOT a version of Marx-Engels Reader by Tucker! If you're looking for that version (especially for a class), DO NOT BUY THIS KINDLE VERSION. It's shameful that Amazon links these two dissimilar items."
1,Rip-off,This kindle edition is not even close to the same as the paperback book. If you need this for a class DO NOT BUY!
5,Turn a cheap monitor into a HDTV.,"Been using this product for about 6-8 years or so, and couldn't be happier. I have a 26 inch flat screen monitor that gets used as a HDTV, and it doubles as a second monitor for our computer.Easy set up. I just wish that HDMI would have been around when I got it. I use VGA to the monitor. HDMI would be a great addition if they haven't already done so."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"the N6 is an excellent product, but only if you know how to use it. for my sharp lcd projector, the magic number was 1024X768 at 75HZ. i am feeding it my DVD player, computer and DTV. gaming on a 100"" screen is simply amazing.i'm guessing that if you are complaining about this product, then you don't know what you are doing. perhaps you should get a nerd to help you set it up.i highly recommend this product."
4,solid album,"i bought this album for a few songs i knew and liked, but all the songs are good and this was worth getting. for whatever reason, though, this album is hard to get. even paco's first album is easier to get than this. anyhow, i'd recommend it."
4,A guilty pleasure,"Just like the magazine, the book is a guilty pleasure with the bonus of many sound fashion and beauty tips. I will be referring to it often."
2,a very dry piece about ancient seafaring,"I couldn't help feeling, as the book progressed, that Barry Cunliffe was filling-out, what little is known about Pytheas, with anything that would fill the space. ""...and if Pytheas had landed at this spot he may have been impressed by the view, and might have taken tea and scones at the local tea-shop (if one were nearby, and had he arrived a couple of millenia later)This is the kind of stuff that, although he didn't write these exact words, he may as well have. A long digression would then follow on some local custom or trade (sometimes pre-dating Pytheas by centuries).The worst thing about this book was that a modern author could give such a dry account that, I am certain, would have been far more enjoyable in Pytheas' own words, as all the translations of the ancients I have ever read flow more easily (including Thucydides)."
3,"Nice size, easy to clean, could use some improvements","I bought this today at our local feed store (much cheaper there compared to Amazon). Once I unwrapped it and inserted the feed block, I noticed like the other reviewer, that the manufacturer did not include a closure hook. This causes the lid to pop open when hung. We have another large wire suet feeder that has a perch for the birds to land on and a hook enclosure. I ended up using the older one and plan to return this one. I agree, that this is a nice feeder size wise, however, there seems to be some easy fixes that could make it excellent."
3,So-so basket but needed for a GREAT feeder product,"The basket isn't much: a simple enclosure with a wimpy chain. In fact, I use a twist tie to keep it closed and purchased an S hook to hang it from the feeder. However, you must have this basket in order to use Morning Song Woodpecker Snack, which is a fantastic product that will significantly increase you feeder traffic. The basket is just a means to get the stuff to your birds. It's too bad they didn't add a chain that's useful or have a clasp of some sort to keep the cage closed, but these problems are easily surmountable. The price here is as good as any I've seen."
4,"SAPO, by Robert Beatty","A book, that I have read through in one go! It is written in a very comprehensive language, you should probably be familiar with a certain software terminology, as well as with the habits of a software writer and the Detroit, MI greater environment to fully enjoy the story."
2,I like Jackie I don't like this DVD,"I ride a bike 16-18 miles a day 6 days a week and have been alternating between Jackie's DVD One-on-One training to a couple of 20 minute Jillian Michaels. I don't like Jillian's attitude but her workouts are effective (I'm 62, am a male, and sticking with level 1). I don't need the cardio; I need modern abs (plank, side plank etc.) and upper body. This Pyramids DVD is too fast and too hard to master and I think very tough on the lower back. I'm still looking for the right DVD. This one isn't it."
4,Typical Jackie,I have other Jackie dvd's and this one is very similar to them. She does alot more with arms than she does with legs. It is a good dvd when you don't feel like jumping around but still want to get in a workout.
3,Liked the upper body workout better,"I was so looking forward to really loving this DVD as I have 2 other of her workout dvds which I LOVE. I do like the pyramid workout but got a better workout with the upper body routine over the lower body and abs routine. My wrists hurt a little during it, but I'm hoping that will improve. The lower body was less challenging, but good maybe for beginners. Unfortunately I did not enjoy doing the abs routine as my neck was hurting due to strain from the exercises. I am an avid fan of JW's Xtreme Timesaver Training and her Xtreme Crunchless Abs. I incorporate her workouts with P90X too."
5,great workout,"All I can say WOW! Jackie Warner's workout are always the best. If I were to hire a personal trainer myself, I would train with Her! Her moves and technique are simple, easy to follow along but....man it's tough and you'll be sore!!!!! the next day. I highly recommend this workout and for 30 day, yes I've seen result and combining with a healty eating diet."
4,My new favorite Jackie DVD,"Going to keep this simple. What I love about this DVD:1. Jackie has created several mini combos for the entire body, where she combines two moves that work different muscle groups together. You switch back and forth, first one move, then the second, and repeat. This allows you a brief rest between reps without having to stop. I love when trainers do this. Keeps the pace up, but doesn't kill your arms and legs, allowing me to actually finish the routine.2. Jackie shows you the entire move before beginning each set. I love being able to watch the move first. That way, I don't feel like I have to play catch up as I scramble to learn a new move.3. Simple, effective strengthening routine. No fancy, elaborate moves. What I love about Jackie is that she knows that form, continuous movement, and a large number of reps is what gets results, not difficult moves that people who are already in shape could pull off.Love Jackie. Will always buy her DVDs."
4,Tough little workout,"I'm more an avid dvd buyer than doer, to be honest. I'd seen a snippet of this and thought it looked doable, so I bought it. I've done the upper body routine twice now, and the lower body section once. I disagree with some previous reviews, in that I found both sections to be very intense (as another said, I was in arm agony for a good two days after first upper body workout), and found both sections to be (for me, anyway) quite an aerobic workout. Jackie's pyramids move very quickly; I'm afraid this might keep me from using good form (I think it affects them on the dvd, too; towards the end of some exercises, the ladies are looking a little less than perfect). I do like that the moves are uncomplicated, but wish the camera would catch the movements from more perspectives, more often.This is probably a more advanced video than I should be using, but I admit, I do like that burn, and the achy muscles the day(s) after make me feel I'm accomplishing something!"
3,"Ok, but not the best Jackie video","I have most of the videos by Jackie Warner and Jillian Michaels. I enjoy their tough workouts and alternate between them to change things up. I was excited to try Jackie's 30-Day Fast Start, thinking it would be even more challenging than her other videos and would push me to the next level. While the workout is a different format and muscles are worked in a new way, I simply didn't feel as challenged. I plan to try it next time with heavier weights. And while I will likely keep this video in my rotation, I may reserve it for ""easier"" days."
4,pretty good,"I gave this workout 4 stars because I really did enjoy it and will go back to it. The pyramid, in case others are as mystified as I was, is basically Jackie taking 2 moves which are performed back to back and adding one rep each time one performs them until you get to 10 straight reps. I think the upper body work out was very good. The lower body workout was very disappointing. Jackie incorporated shoulder work with the lower body workout--at least for me, that limited how heavy of a dumbell I could use. I would have used a heavier weight if I was just working out the lower body. Also the segment for the lower body is very short. The ab section was the most challenging for me. I think Jackie's Xtreme time saver workout is overall better but this is more interesting!"
1,Poor excuse for music,This CD blows. It is a complete waste of money and I feel sorry for you if you bought it.
5,One of my favorite CD's from one of my favorite bands,"This is definitely an excellent follow-up to their heavy-hitting ""Receiving the Gift of Flavor"", and it's a must-have if you like stuff like 311, Shootyz Groove, and 2 Skinnee J's. This CD is a little more mellow than their last one, but it's also a more mature one in the respect that there's more attention to little details. Some of my favorite songs on this album is Divide and Conquer, Straight to Hell, Prayer for Rain, and Gene Machine (a Bad Brains cover). Go see them live when they come your way. They absolutely put everybody else to shame, hands down."
3,Looked used.,"I ordered 2 key chains. They arrived quickly in the mail. However, when they arrived the key chains had fingerprints on the back of the key chain and 1 was scratched on the front. It would be more inconvenient to send the products back. I am not pleased with the quality because they looked used."
1,better than old seinfeld re-run,but not by much. at least the dinosaurs look cool.best viewed while the sound is turned off so you're notdistracted by the dialogue.
4,"Good not great film, real good DVD","This is my least favorite of the Jurassic Park films. Story line could have been better & they needed a ""female"" character in the film, not the one pretending to be an exwife & mother in it. Real good extras on the DVD."
3,"It was an okay film, but deserves no praise.","How do you top two blockbuster predecessors, both related to formidable dinosaurs, in its third sequel? The answer: you don't.Although the plot was rather vague and ambiguous, the special effects, sound, cinematography were quite weak, as expected. I don't think anyone expected the same thrill they received when they saw the original Jurassic Park.During most of the scenes, it felt as though the screen writers decided to make a movie about dinosaurs chasing people, trying to kill them. If there was an excuse to bring the dinosaurs close to people, such an action was always followed. This was strange.Also, considering the quickness of the movie -- roughly 90 minutes -- it felt as though the movie was rushed. Thus, it fueled the belief, even more, that this movie had no plot and a hurried atmosphere. It was okay. This was certainly not a great film."
1,It's a dreadful film,"I'm sorry, but I cannot believe that the average rating for this film is so high. It is a completely awful film. Firstly, it's very very predictable which is enough reason to avoid it anyway. Secondly, what the XXXX is a Spinosaurus? It's a dreadful film, I can't stress it enough. The only fun I had during this thankfully short piece is watching Tea Leoni's (sp?) facial expressions. Surely the worst actress I have ever seen in any film in history. She's appauling, so is the film. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"Totally stupid, ordinary and meaningless","If I saw this movie when Jurassic Park I came,that would have been great but the fact is, this isthe third episode and it's simply the same as thetwo others. No valuable plot. Just dinosaurs makinga mess. Special effects, screams, noises. Thismovie is SUCH a perfect illustration of Hollywood'slack of creativity these days. Just take a good movie,make three of seven sequels out of it and see howlong we can sell it.I was a fan of Jurassic Park I when it came out.But this is the final assault to repetitivity.This is SO repetitive that it's sickening.They tried to ""innovate"" a little bit by throwingsome new spieces of dinos in there but that's aboutit. Same damn island, same stupid clueless peoplewanting to go there for I don't know what reason.And same line of events as the two other brothers.Please God, send some story writers in there, theyneed it. Please help Hollywood making good moviesagain and don't buy this movie."
1,The dinosaurs of Jurassic are getting boring!,"Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Michael Jeter return for the third Jurassic Park film.Sam now gives seminars on dinosaurs, but swears he will never go bacvk to Jurassic park again. Well, he gets talked into being a guide for some inexperienced adventure seekers. When they begin to write a check for him in a large amount, then his decision is affirmative. So, okay, they will stay on a plane and fly over. Well, it doesn't exactly work that way and Sam finds himself stuck in dinosaur land again.Not much to this third movie we haven't seen before. Boring storyline.Update: Jurassic Park IV will be released June 13, 2014."
3,fair to middling,"This second effort at a sequel to JURASSIC PARK is a considerable imptrovement over THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, but from the science fiction standpoint there is litt;e original to it. I've written better science fiction plots myself--several of them. It seems not to occur to any of these hacks that the modern world is a totally alien ecology for dinosaurs, which could comprise an important plot element."
4,Better than I expected,"This film was much better than I expected, however, it still is far removed from the first JP film. A creative plot to return the professor to the island, that lands the ""tourists"" in a heap of trouble. If you enjoyed the first two Jurassic Park films, you'll probably enjoy this one as well. It is very suspenseful, and introduces a whole new prehistoric fear in the ""hunted."""
4,They're back!!! The Dinosarus return....,"After being somewhat disappointed with the ""The Lost World"" I was a bit weary of a second sequel to the mega hit, ""Jurassic Park"". However, I was pleasantly surprised and liked this one a great deal. The new director, Joe Johnston, makes the movie an enjoyable thrill ride, much like the first in the series, with action from start to finish. And, because they are the REAL stars of the movie, we are introduced to a new dinosaur, even more terrifying than the towering T-Rex. The Spinosaurus is an incredible new edition to the menagerie of dinosaurs that we've come to expect in these movies. This is a good dvd and a nice companion to the other two. I recommend it as a really good adventure film."
3,Nothing More Than Mindless Fun,I find Jurrasic Park 3 to be a good sequel to a great film. I think this should have been the sequel to the first film. Sure the diagoule was kind of written the way people talk but who cares just go in and have a good time. Can't wait for Jurraisc Park 4
2,Jurassic ...,"What a [let down]. This movie not only destroys what was set up before with Jurassic Park and The Lost World but does not even retains the same quality. There is nothing in this pitiful sequel that is up to snuff with the other movies in the series, and the actors themselves look like they are acting at gun point. This has a more strait to video feel than the first two, and judging by the lack of talent involve, it should have gone to video instead of the big screen.I hope they don't make Jurassic Park 4."
4,"If you did not read the book, you did not get the complete story","I read the book which the vast majority of the reviewers did not. The first movie incorporated some of the storyline and added new material. This third movie included some of the beginning of the book that was left out of the first movie. Again new material was added which changed the storyline.If I ignored the book and just rated the movie for its storyline, it was very entertaining. However I can only give it 4 stars because several scenes were just overdramatized. Had the first movie stuck closer to the book, it would have been even better. But what I missed in the first movie was for the most part included in this one so that is why it was satisfying to me. Many of the negative reviewers did not know about this splitting up of the book's story and so did not understand the significance of what they were viewing."
4,jp3,"THIS MOVIE ALMOST TOPS THE FIRST. HERE ARE THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT:1. T-REX WAS BORING NOW SO THEY USED SPINO2. NEW RAPTORS (WHO I THINK SHOULD CHANGE IN ALL THE MOVIES)3. PTERANODONS WHO HAVE ALSO CHANGED4. SAM NEIL AND LAURA DERN ARE BACK5. YOU CAN JUST BARRLY TELL THE DIFERENCE BETWEEN CG AND ANAMOTRONICKS6. THERE ARE OTHER DUCKBILLS BESIDES PARASUARALOPHUSHERE ARE THE BAD THINGS ABOUT IT:1. THE BRACHIOSAURS LOOK TERIBLE2. I WISH THE HAD MAID THE FEMALE VELOCIRAPTORS LIKE THE ONES IN THE FIRST MOVIE NOT THE UGLY PAIL COLOR3. IT IS TOO SHORT4. BILLY SHOULD HAVE DIED5. THE TRIKES ARE GREEN, NOT BROWN.6. TEA LEONE SCREAMS WAY TOO MUCHIT'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIDGINALL BUT IT'S WAY BETTER THAN THE LOST WORLD!"
2,Jurassic Park 3 is a crowd.,"Special effects are good but how many of these trite movies need to be made? I started rooting for the dinosaurs immediately in this one, not mid-way as in the first 2!What we all could do with a well written movie involving dinosaurs and the great special effects that are available. Please enough is enough, and really are there no insects in this jungle? It would seem to me that bug bites and stings would be the most frequent attacks that anyone would face."
3,"Not bad, but not the best!","Ok, well this movie was overall pretty good. The action scenes were exciting and well done. The acting was ok and the new dinosaurs looked pretty good. Although there were a few things this movie lacked. When I first saw it in the theater, I thought it was missing like a whole half hour. They should have made a longer movie. Also, what was with that phone ringing in the stomach of the spinosaurus. Highly unlikely if you ask me. Another problem I had with this movie was that kid. He was suppossed to be this little twelve year old boy, who gets stranded on and island alone, just happens to find a watertruck to live in, happens to find food to live off of, I mean come on. How unrealistic can it get. The last thing I would like to say is why did Joe Johnston direct the movie? If Spielberg directed this one, as he did the other two, it would have been much better."
4,Better then I expected it to be.,"I first saw this movie in the theater on July 24. I cant say that I was disappointed. It was great fun and action. The main reason I went to see Jurrasic Par 3 was the fact that Sam Niell was staring in it. He is one of my favorite actors. His performences in The Hunt for The Red October and The Piano are outstanding.I give Jurassic Park 3 four stars. It has alot of action, a great deal of CG dinosaurs and graphics, and is alot of fun.The DVD itself is excelent. It has a great array of extras. ""New Dinosaurs of Jurassic Park 3"", ""A Visit To ILM"", a commentay with the special effects team, and much more.Anyone who is Jurassic Park fan should own this DVD."
2,Nothing on Heaven or Earth could get me back on that island.,"That should say it all for Sam Niell's Dr. Alan Grant. Still, only five minutes later, Grant is accepting a large check and is on a helicopter to Isla Sorna. Another example of art imitating life as the only reason for making this movie was for a quick paycheck.JP3 lacks the freshness of the other two films in the franchise, suffers from the lack of a human villain, an abrupt ending, and even sends out the wrong message to kids of divorced parents: ""Kids! Wanna get your folks back together? Put yourself in mortal danger!"" Please...Finally even, the much hyped showdown between T-Rex and the bigger spinosaurus, was over and done too quickly to keep our interest. All in all, this was a color by numbers effort by all concerned..."
2,review,This movie suked I liked 1 and 2 but the new director is terrible Steven Speilberg is a hell of alot better
4,john's review,"I liked the action and the new animals. At points, you didn't know what to expect next. I would recommend it to anyone who has seen Jurassic Park or Lost World"
1,The worst sequence of a movie and the worst summer film! CP,"When Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park', which I have not seen, opened in 1993 it was one of those films that was an instant blockbuster. Like 'Rush Hour 2' and 'Shrek'. Four years later Steven got up the courage to direct 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', otherwise known simply as 'Jurassic Park 2'. What I meant by when I said ""got up the courage"" I meant he was taking a chance with the critics, if they were going to like it or if they were going to hate it. They hated it and so did I. 'Jurassic Park 2' is like Best Picture up against 'Jurassic Park 3', the worst film of the summer and probably the worst film of the year, but I haven't seen 'Planet of the Apes' yet. The acting was beyond the grave of sadness, the film's setting was next to nonexistent, and to top it off, what mother in their right mind would let their son go parachutting on a forbidden island? Get real hollywood!"
2,"Watch it, only to say that you did.",I think it is time to stop milking the CG dinosaurs Steven. Let's move on.
1,Jurassic What??????????????????,Well Here is what I'm going to say These are the wrongs1. In the lost world they said there was no Fences.2. The pterandons was already out.3. Spinosaurus is a little sorter than the real t-rex.4. Spinosaurus don't look like that.5. It a Baronix with a Slik on the Back.6. The writers of the Films haven't been doing there home work on Michal Chriton BooksThis was a Made up storie and it deserve to be on a low down theing. Read the books and call it Part 3 becasue this movie was a NO NO.
2,(...),"It's quite clear from the first 10 minutes that the author was not involved with this film. I wish I could say that the dinosaurs looked real, that the plot was believable (even for fiction), and that the ending was a show-stopper...but then I'd be lying through my teeth. The edge, the excitement, and the awe from JP-1 left the building when JP-3 arrived. Even the ""mighty Raptors"" couldn't deliver this story from sequel/trilogy hell; one can only milk the intelligence of these creatures for so many movies, and then it just gets ridiculous. (...)"
3,A Poor Excuse For A Sequel!,"Why would Universal have given the ""OK"" on this film? It was bad! Steven Spielberg didn't direct or write. He produced it, but I imagine he was so busy with ""A.I."" that he didn't realize how bad this movie would turn out. Conned into visiting site B, Alan Grant leads a search party for a couple in the midst of a divorce's son. They discover not only that the dinosaurs are thriving on the island, but they are evolving. They can now communicate! The story is pretty lame! The original film should have been left alone! I'm not saying its the worst waste of your money. I wasn't sorry I saw it, but I wish that they had come up with a better storyline!"
3,A lean action adventure.,Jurassic Park 3 is much better than the awful 'The Lost World' but not as good as the first film.The Spinosaurus and the Pterodactyls are spectacular and make this a great ride.The director has wisely not made it overlong or overblown(as 'The Lost World' was)but the question is-just how long is the audience going to but the ridiculous idea that the dinosaurs can't be shot?Once again we don't see a so much as a bullet being fired at them.Absurd.
2,Wish it was like the others,"JP 3 was no match for the previous two in the series. I did enjoy several of the scenes and the plot wasnt terrible, but the big villian dinosaur looked like a big whimp even though he kills old t-rex. the story with the son is impossible and you would have to be some sort of idiot to go on a trip without the check in hand. The end was so stupid and way to sudden. they step out of the forest and boom. the end is dumb and the movie was too short. it was probably worth a rent but definately not one of the greats of 2001."
3,Jurassic Park III - Should Have Been Better,"The movie is better than the pathetic second one, I'll give it that much.Unfortunately, it does not measure up to the first. The ending is too abrupt, the dinosaur attack scenes no longer original, this movie could have used further development.Finally, did they really have to have a ""Barney"" parody?"
3,Ho Hum,"It's an average flick. About what you'd expect after seeing the first two in the series. It's interesting, but nothing special.Special effects and sound are great. Story leaves a little to be desired. Too predictable."
3,Better than part 2,"This is the 2nd best in the series besides Jurassic Park and Lost World Jurassic Park was terrible,but part 3 has Dr.Alan Grant and his reserach crew going back to Jurassic Park and trying to fight the dinosaurs and who will win.this one is a mildly bloody chapter that's scary,violent,and even entertaining only the plot is the same and the new dinosaurs were not as scary,though a major improvement over the 2nd one."
3,where's speilberg?,"An attempt to continue one of the most original film-series of all time.with an iffy beginning, the movie never gets much better. however there are some great special effects (of course) and some quite admorable actors. but in all its a science project that had no spine, a bad mix of storylines, a lack of the jurassic park engineer in steven speilberg, and coaded with some named actors that had no material to work with all in a sour broth of humanitairian ideals. it goes off-track from the series and being a lover of the first film, i was utterly disapointed with its 3rd counterpart. 3 out of 5 which was generous."
3,Should Be Renamed: JPL,"This is not the worst movie ever- but close to it. This is what you would call Jurassic Park Lame(JPL). How much more boring can you can an action movie. This movie is on the edge of being a drama it has so little action and since it was so close and didn;t have any of the elements, this is what you can say- BORING! There is nothing that can make you jump out of your seat or make you sit on the edge of your seat, which is what an action/adventure movie should. The first two Jurassic Parks are so much better. I would of loved it if it wasn't for the no action. If you want something good get Rush Hour II."
2,"ANOTHER SEQUEL, SAME OLD STORY","At least they have Sam Neill in this one!The only wonderful scene was when the flying pteraodon turned his head in full close-up at the humans. The special effects in that scene were amazing, looking so real.Actually the flying pteraodons were the stars in this movie. However this movie left me wanting more. The plot was really no plot, the movie was short, basically it was throw some dinosaurs in, some screaming, a hero, [and a love story] and again Hollywood ruins it again.Fun for rentable fare other than that 3 times is NOT a charm."
4,great movie but we need dodgson back,The spiecal effects are great and Michael Jeter has a cool charector. However dump Mister Spino-Breath get Rex back in and Lewis Dodgson needs to return so a group of Velociraptors can spill his intestines. Know what I mean?
4,Great entertaining,This is again a very good attempt by Steven spielberg.Great horror and effects by him.I saw that movie five times.Two times in cineme and three time at home.
2,Pretty good but definately not as good as the other two,It was cool but very short and not enuogh suspense. The other two kept me on the edge of my seat thinking what could possibly happen next!! And the scene with the lawer (Jurassic Park) LOL!
1,MIA: JOHN HAMMOND LAST SEEN JP2,"OK, where is hammond? This crappy movie is....well...crappy. I'm sorry to say this but I am a JP fan ever since the first movie. The reason enough this [stinks] is that there is not enough back ground to these characters. I mean what happened between the first movie and then? Did the palentoligist hook up with the whiny women? Did Hammond croak?They instantly srug off the t-rex so the SO NARROW IT IS CHEESY SPINOSARUS COULD TAKE OVER. Why? The other thing is THE RAPTERS ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN SUPER INTELLEGENT. THEY ALSO HAVE WHINY TAG-ALONGS SUCH AS THOSE TWO PEOPLE PORTRAYING TO BE RICH. I don't need to rant on and on... get a book untill anouther better seaquil comes out."
3,"Hey, at least it's turning out better than the Jaws series.","Joe Johnston takes up the directing reins over Steven Spielberg for JPIII, a relatively plotless film which basically gets a group of people to an island full of dinosaurs, with the typical chaos that ensues. Decent second sequel is pretty entertaining for most of its running time, thanks to a returning Sam Neill (likeable as ever as Dr. Grant), a good sense of humor, and some exciting action sequences. The special effects are mostly excellent, though the Spinosaurus (who, by the way, is NOT an improvement over the T-Rex) often appears too animatronic. Recommended, but the ending is a disappointment, however."
1,Real lousy sequel to two much better films.,"I've been a fan of the Jurassic Park series since the original, and while The second movie (The Lost World) was not as fine a film, it still retain the some of the magic of its predecessor. This film unfortunately not only a major let down in every sense of the word but a major letdown to the fans in general. There is really no plot to speak off what so ever in this lousy follow up but another excuse to bring people back in contact with the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs themselves look more like C.G.I cartoons than real animals, and when you have acting as bad as the special effects themselves, you know that the movie is in trouble. It's pretty sad when a sequel to two fine films does not live up to the standards of what it's predecessors set forth, but when the movie is this bad, then it should be considered a crime.Sam Neill should be a shame of himself for selling the fans out.Grade: F-"
4,"The best ""Jurassic Park"" movie!","I got this DVD for Christmas, and I liked it. I think it's by far better than any of the other Jurassic Park movies. The raptors are better than ever. They are always good, but, in this movie they were the best. The plot could have been better and longer. But, this movie sure is worth your money!"
2,The curse of sequels,"We are yet on another trip to Jurassic Park. This time, a couple is searching for a boy that is lost on the island. Allan Grant (Sam Neill) is hired as a dinosaur expert. On the island, there are new dinosaurs. Why can't they stop making Jurassic Park movies?"
3,"More comedy, less dino action","JURASSIC PARK 3 could be viewed as the weakest in the series for a number of reasons. First, there's far less dino action (...). The plot is weak... I mean COME ON, DINO's that can talk to eachother?! Much less live in harmony with humans?! And what about the cell phone thing?! Anyways I digress. Besically in JURASSIC PARK 3, the dinosaurs are somehow comical and fake. The story goes like this... A couple forces ""the scientist/dino guy"" (Sam Neil) to go with them the the ""island of dinosaurs"" so that they can find their son (who crashed onto the island a few months ago). So, they end up crashing on the island and the fun begins. I thought JURASSIC PARK 3 was the weakest in the series but it was still fun. It seemed really short too. All in all it's worth taking a look at. The DVD edition comes with a ton of bonus stuff."
2,This movie suffers from sequelitis,"In Jurassic Park III Sam Neill as Dr. Grant looks tired. No wonder, this 3rd in the series of Dinosaur experiment gone wrong movies has the look and feel of a film thrown out for public consumption and quick profit. While big on blood and special effects there is nothing new here. This film is why people hate sequels. Raptors, raptors everywhere. Terradactyls fly off into the sunset at the end of this movie, with glee on the look of the faces of all the main characters. Considering these creatures were hunting them down, you wonder why? Its one thing to make a sequel that adds something to the original story line, Jurassic Park III just has nothing to contribute. The scene with Barney did give one hope that this stinker was almost over."
2,"See Dino, run, repeat.",The movie is even worse than you remember. Unlike the first two movies all problems are solved with a dash or gimick. Only once are you held in suspense while they try to escape a dinosaur. Otherwise it's just a journey across an island that happens to have raptors.
2,Steven Spielberg rocks!,"Before I watched this movie, I thought it would be just as good as the first two. I could'nt have been more wrong. Jurassic Park 3 isn't half as good as the first two. Director Joe Johnston tries to match a Steven Spielberg movie, but fails terribly. Gone is the suspense and adventure that made Spielberg's first two classics so popular. Also gone is the T-Rex from the first two. Instead, he's replaced with a stupid Spinosaurus.And the velociraptors don't seem as vicious as in the first two either. Joe Johnston comes up with stupid characters that get so annoying you wish they got eaten, and some dumb shots. Jurassic Park 3 isn't totally terrible, but it needs work. I don't even want to think about how bad this movie would have been without Steven Spielberg as the executive producer. He breathes some life into this movie. If you're expecting a Jurassic Park as good as the first two, step away now. If you're a die hard Jurassic Park fan, you might want to step away anyway."
3,Best of the Three,"Jurassic Park was entertaining, but The Lost World (which was the 2nd film) was a stinker. Jurassic Park III, I feel, is the best of the trio, presenting itself in the traditional formula of classic Hollywood films. The first two movies featured people invested with exotic professions in one sense or another. Granted that's usual even in classic Hollywood. This version, however, pits everyday people (basically the family involved) with the ferocious nature of the island. It increases the tension. The addition of William H. Macy, one of our most enjoyable contemporary actors, adds significantly to the mix. Would anyone have survived if the situation had been real? Probably not. JPIII is just good pulp action melodrama. Shorter than its predecessors (at c.90 mins.), the screenplay is lean and to the point. The boat that they find and use to travel down river reminds me of something out of a Joseph Conrad story. I highly recommend this underrated film for pure fun and thrills."
2,Yawn....I fell asleep during this movie.,"Would somebody tell me what one Gods Green Earth this was. This can't be the third installment in this series! Jurassic Park III is a dissapointment on many fronts.There was nothing that broke any new grounds like the first two movies did. This movie is a poor follow-up to the the first J. Park movie and the Lost World. In fact I almost felt cheated when I spent eight dollars on a ticket to go see this movie. Everything that was on the second movie was here but this movie is so predictable. It's almost like watching a scrapped version of the original movie. As a fan of the first two Jurassic Park Movies this was a bitter pill to swallow. So cheap, so predictable, thrown together in like 20 minutes, is a few things I can say about this disaster sequel. Major dissapointment.Oh Well. I guess I'll wait another four years for the fourth one."
3,Jurassic Park (the third time around!),"Jurassic Park III is more simply a dinosaur movie that you take the entire family to see ""Nothing more, Nothing less!"" I like JP3 a lot better than the much disappointing ""Lost World: JP2"" that only Speilberg HAD to do enorder to have Universal produce ""Schindler's List"". Many people felt mixed about this film and same with me ,but hey the graphics are better than the first two.This film had likable characters, a sense of humor more dinosaurs!!!!! Plot needs to be better ,but still enjoyable."
3,It was ok,This movie is ok. I mean since it is the third one it is kind of getting old. The first and second one's we're the best. But since you know that most likely they are going to get attacked by dinosaurs and they have to figure out away to survive.I own the first and second one and when I saw the third one in the theaters it seemed like it was really short.But alot of people liked it and see what you think.
2,Jurassic Park III review,"When watching Jurassic Park III I couldn't help but think one thing...why? Why did they make this movie? I tried to like it but I have to say the only good thing about this one was Sam Neill's return as Dr. Alan Grant and Laura Dern's cameo. The premise of the story is that a boy and his mom's boyfriend are parasailing near Isla Sorna when they crash, then the parents of said boy go to Dr. Grant and trick him into going to Isla Sorna. The story itself was cheesy but what made it worse was the whole raptors are super intelligent (and I mean ridiculously intelligent) granted we knew Raptors were smart in the first couple films but now they have their own speech and...yeah it's...a little much. Another thing a lot of this movie is just a compliation of left overs from the first book (i.e. the river boat, the bird cage.) I could go on but my advice is if you enjoy the first couple films steer clear of this one. (Not that I really enjoyed the Lost World that much.)"
1,Mumbo Jumbo,"Besides the fact that this movie is incredibly short there are horrible plot holes. Why on Earth is there a new Dinosuar wouldn't we have heard about it in the previous movies? He kills T-rex right when we see them but if he was so superior He would have killed him a long time ago. All of the people get killed in the first few minutes. After that no one dies how is that suspenseful? The Veloceraptors talk too. This movie is very poorly written. It is as if the producers walked in and said ""new dinosaur, veloceraptors talk, nobdy important dies; run with it"""
5,GREAT FLIK!,I loved all of the Jurassic Parks! Would have loved to find out that Sam's character had had children - but then I am a romantic!Great nasty dinosaurs - love the commentaries!The commentaries help me to understand what the movie makers are trying to accomplish and I appreciate the movie more. Especially all the effort the actors put into their roles.Everyone must listen to their own instincts and judge these movies themselves -- what is great for one is not for another!I hardly ever agreed with Siskel and Ebert.I am not one for overkill but I would like to see another follow-up in the near future. Like yesterday! I hate waiting 3 or 4 years for a follow-up -- I may not get to see it. Thanks guys for so much great entertainment.
4,Jurassic Park III,"For fans of the original, this is a pretty good sequel. It has an interesting plot about a lost boy surviving on ""Dinosaur Island"", and it brings back Sam Neill, who adds just the right touch of knowledgable fear (compared to the idiot ""tourists"" he's with.) I felt the gore level was less than the previous two movies, but the fear factor was just as great -- perhaps greater, due to the flying creatures in this episode. We look forward to JP IV!"
4,High Marks for This Sequel,"One of the best sequels produced in recent years for a blockbuster original. It seems that when one views a movie sequel we always compare it to the previous hit. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Lethal Weapon, and now Jurassic Park have had sequels. The question is does the movie stand on its own. If it were the first film in the series, would it stand up as a good film. In this case, the answer is definitely Yes. The dinosaurs are truly great, the action is good and the story is believeable but a little weak. Sam Neill's character is revived as the hero to lead the group of uneducated stranded victims to safety. Of course, the dinosaurs are a small obsticle to their survival as they are pursued across the island by velociraptors and a very large and aggressive spinosaurus. A very entertaining and enjoyable film. **** stars"
3,Average quality DVD and story,"Decent, but not great story line. The original was by far the best. The dinosaurs in this one, however, are much better, and more realistic. I've watched it a couple of times and find it enough entertainment for my satisfaction.The DVD itself has plenty of information on the making of the film and how they did the special effects. There aren't many special effects on the DVD, however. There was one dead spot for sound towards the end of the movie."
3,An Enjoyable Popcorn Flick,Jurassic Park III further expands the JP universe. I have previously seen Jurassic Park and this does not quite live up to the original but it's enjoyable nonetheless. The visuals and script are good while the acting is decent as well. I recommend JPIII and I give it a 7 out of 10.
3,"Worth ONE watch, only!","I waited in anticipation for this film, and was disappointed! I agree with what others have said here, I miss Steven Spielberg as director. I loved seeing Sam Neill again, but what happened between him and Lorna Doone? That's never explained, like so much of the film. Is Billy his son or are they just close? And yes, Tea should have been eaten, the way she runs screaming through the film!The behind-the-scenes is probably more interesting than the film itself.Still, it's worth one watch, just so you know you didn't miss anything!I preferred the Widescreen version, even though I have a square TV, that way you don't miss any edges of the scenes.This was a shockingly short film, with no thrills and fewer dinosaurs."
2,Jurassic What?,"Let me tell you this first, I loved the first two Jurassic Parks.Then came Jurassic Park III.The basic point of the movie was so somehow they could make up a storyline believable enough that people would come and see it and the producers could make some money.This movie passes by too fast, your sitting down and putting the first popcorn in your mouth and WHAM! it's over.Bottom line -Unless your into a few fake dinosaurs, one old Jurassic park character (Goldblum wasn't in this one :(), and a short film...BUY ITotherwiseGo and see something good, like Lord of the Rings or the old documentary Hoop Dreams"
2,So much room for improvement...,"""Jurassic Park 3"" is probably the most disappointed with a film I've ever been. It had so much going for it, and delivered so little. The film's biggest problem is the silly plot. The first film was believable, the second film was fun, this one's got energy, but we've been there, done that. But back to the plot: Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is lured back to the island the same way he was lured the first time: with money. That Grant could possibly be so greedy and stupid is the film's most unbelievable part. Most everyone (the characters) in this movie deserves to be eaten by dinosaurs, but only a few are. In a way, I'm glad Spielberg didn't direct this one. This would have seriously hurt his career. It's not a terrible film, but it's not good. I'd say only hardcore fans might like this one. But that's only a guess."
3,I liked the movie,"This was a good movie to me. This is an example when you have to see for yourself instead of relying on critics to ""advice"" you."
1,"No, just no.","This movie SUCKS!! I was 12, but as I got older and really started looking at it, this movie SUCKS! The first two are amazing, the 2nd is my fav, but this no. Just no."
5,Awsome,"I really enjoyed the orginal Jurrasic Park. I felt it was about time a really good dinosaur movie was made. When the second movie came out I was not as impressed having a great movie just been done. However, this third movie kept me at the edge of my seat the entire movie. One complaint I have is that a certain times in the movie, the dialogue is so soft I was increasing the volume control to heard what was being said. Then the animals would appear and the volume was much too loud. You would think that the film people would have a solution for this. This aside, I very much enjoyed this movie...."
1,"""WERE NOT GOING TO GET OF THIS ISLAND ALIVE"" SAID SAM NEILL",PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT BUY IT. IF YOU LIKE BIG STUPID DINOASOURS THAT EAT A COUPLE OF STUPID GUYS THAT GO ON A FANTASTY ISLAND THEN YOUELL LIKE THIS MOVIE.THE STUPIDIST PART IN THE MOVIE IS WHEN (SAM NEILL AS DR. GRANTT) SAY EITHER WAY WE WONT GET OF THIS ISLAND ALIVE. PLEASE EVERYBODY LIVE EXCEPT THE THREE STUPID GUYS THAT YOU BEARLEY SEE IN THE MOVIE AND NOBODY KNOWS THEM AND THE PART WHEN (MICHAEL JETER AS MR. UDESKY) DIES. PLEASE A RAPTOR SNAPS HIS NECK AND DOESNT EAT HIM WHAT HAPPEND TO THE REAL DINOASOURS THAT EAT THE PEOPLE NOT SNAP THERE NECKS AND RUN OFF VERY DUMB MOVIE. YES ITS EVEN WORSER THEN JURASSIC PARK 2. I GIVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE ITS A SHORT MOVIE AND YOU DONT HAVE TO WAIT ALONG TIME FOR IT TO BE OVER.
1,rot in hell spino!,"I hated it. It was the most god aful thing I've ever seen. spinokilled rex. the king, the boss, the headhoncho.another thingthey only found 1 skelleton,and it was onley 26 feet."
1,WHY?? WHY?? WHY??,"Horrific !! Why wasted such good material with bad, stupid script and bad editing ?? Even an A list cast would not be able to save this very bad piece of work !! I seriously looking forward to the director's comment in the DVD on how and why did he made this terrible film."
4,DECENT ENOUGH,"This movie was reasonable enough to pass but I think it could be better. Sam Neil returns and a whole new cast with new dinos. This time Neil is called by a couple to go to Isla Nora (the island is the second) to help them find there son who disseapeared eight weeks earlier parisailing over the island. As they search they find new dangers including a spinosauraus who breaks the T-Rex's neck, pterodactly's and even more raptors. When on the island they find an old factory which is used to make more dinos( great scene). This movie's special effects were good but it was too short and focused too much on the raptors. It's decent and has less gore."
3,Mediocre Movie--Good Extras,"The film is only so-so, but the extras on the DVD are fun. It's interesting to see the progression of special effects through the three movies from either digital OR model to a striking combination of both.Probably the best DVD extras of any of the three films."
2,Not what it could have been.,"While I'm a huge fan of Jurassic Park, the last movie could have been much better. The characters weren't developed enough and the movie just moved along too quickly.The movie did have scary parts in it and the dinasours were great, it just wasn't the same as the original. Maybe if Stephen Spielberg himself had directed it, it might have been better."
2,Blood and guts,"If you like blood and guts, this is the movie for you. Its the same story you've heard twice before, only you groan...aloud...thinking ""HOW DID YOU GET YOURSELF IN THIS MESS AGAIN??""Its not bad brain candy, though."
2,Don't bother,If you enjoyed the first or even the second I recommend that you watch those. This is nothing but a big budget film cashing in on it's past success. After ten minutes I was ready to turn the film off. After twenty minutes I was mad at myself for not turning the film off. How many times are we to be taken bck to the island and not feel like we are getting ripped off?
4,jurrasic park 3,jp3 was a great movie. Lots of special effects and action.new dinos and no malcom.i sort of miss the t.rex but you got to have new ones.the only bad stuff was it had a sad plot.And 3 or four kills.it had not very much thrills but its a reeeallly cool movie 4 and a half stars i'd rate it.aslo recomended planet of the apes.jp2 and jp1 and the mummy 1&2.
2,A Pointless Movie!,"BOTTOM LINE:This movie sucked! The story was ridiculous and the movie completely lost all of its magic. Even with the Pteradactyls it didn't work. The humans were unbelievably stupid, and the dinosaurs were reduced to nothing more than oversized monsters.waste of a good franchise."
5,The raptors rock,"I loved this edition of Jurassic Park. It was not as good as the first one because its not as groundbreaking. However it does go in a new direction unlike the second one which just copies the success of 2. With that said, bringing back Dr. Grant was a great idea. He's perfect for his part."
5,One of the most important movies of our time,"This is one of the most important movies of our time, and it was very difficult for me to get my hands on - in spite of the affordable price today. I had to wait a long time for it to come out on DVD.For those who have ever heard of the McMartin pre-school case and/or the movie ""Indictment"" based on same, this movie is also based on McMartin but not as if it were a hoax - which it was not. The preschool has another name, but the general facts of the case are all present. This movie was put out in 1989 and pretty much disappeared after that. I caught it once on the Lifetime channel and went looking all over the Internet for it, including the Lifetime channel itself. No dice.I'm thrilled to have it today. If this topic interests you at all, this is a movie to have in your collection.Indictment - The McMartin Trial"
1,Uninformed and Dangerous,"I cannot stress enough how truly uninformed this author is, there is no scientific or medical data to back any of her ridiculous claims. I believe this book is either self-published or published by a vanity press of some sort. There is nothing in here that I found helpful and plenty that could lead someone to make a potentially deadly decision regarding treatment options.This book is a great disservice to anyone with breast cancer."
5,Understanding Cancer,"The best statement made in her book, SURVIVE CANCER, is Ms. Moss' simple expression that ""Cancer is a systemic disease"". Women hear that they have a cancerous tumor of the breast and immediately want the ""foreign object"" removed from their bodies. But when you cancer is a systemic disease--it doesn't simply exist within a tumor. And cutting into it only spreads it! Do not fall victim to the fears that the medical community instills in its patients who are diagnosed with the disease. Educate yourself, ask questions, and take time to make a life saving decision relative to your treatment."
5,"Seems to work for me, but I'm no expert","I use the 16x20x1 version. Now they don't look exactly like the major brands that you find at Lowes or Home Depot, etc, but they seem sturdy enough and seem to work and trap the same amount of dust, pollen, fibers etc when I change them out. Quality of material used seems to be pretty good too. Has pleated like the major brands as well as what looks like metal grid on one side like the major brands too. I will purchase more when I start to run out again."
1,doubt these are MERV 12 filters,I've purchased a lot of different furnace filters and these are not what I expected. I doubt very much they are rated at a MERV 12. Filtrete makes a model 1250 filter that is rated at MERV 11 and is a much tighter weave than these. Not worth the money!
3,interesting but disappointing indie,"Never heard of this 2001 con man film. Watched it recently on the Sundance Channel. The Prime Gig is better thanBoiler Room, which I found glitzy yet empty, but miles from the genre's gold standard,Glengarry Glen Ross.The first third of the film offers a treasure trove of character actors, who, while not on the level of Pacino, Lemmon et al, are still imminently interesting: Stephen Tobolowsky, Wallace Shawn, George Wendt. Unfortunately, they all disappear as the action moves to the upscale selling room. Bad move.With virtually no sympathetic characters and a plot full of holes, this was never going to be a commercial success. Even on an artistic basis, it fails: the ending is both obvious and not credible. Vince Vaughn does okay, and Ed Harris is always worth watching, but I would hang up on this like a cheap telemarketer."
4,THE EXPECTED STILL KILLS YOU,"BY THE TIME THIS MOVIE HAS ENDED, YOU ARE TIRED.IT'S BREATHLESS PACE AND MOVEMENT LEAVE YOU FEELING AS IF YOU HAVE JUST RUN A 10K RACE.THE PEOPLE ARE BEAUTIFUL. THE SETS ARE STARK. EVERYTHING THAT IS NECESSARY IS THERE, BUT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE.<BR> YOU MOVE THROUGH THE STORY LIKE A FAMILIAR DANCE, BUT BY THE END, THE STEPS THAT YOU KNEW AT THE BEGINNING, DESERT YOU, AND YOU FIND YOURSELF STUMBLING ALL OVER A STORY THAT YOU EXPECTED, BUT STILL TRIPS YOU UP ENOUGH TO LAND YOU RIGHT ON YOUR BUTT.<BR>YOU CATCH YOUR BREATH AND GRIEVE.<BR> I RECOMMEND THIS HIGH ENERGY MOVIE FOR ANYONE WHOSE LIFE IS A FAST RIDE AND THEY ARE STILL YELLING FOR MORE SPEED.<BR> 4 STARS. THIS ONE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY"
2,zzzzzzzzzzz,"I had high hopes for this film, because I love Vince Vaughn in a dramatic role, but this film just didn't showcase it well. Frankly it was just really boring. The tension didn't run high enough. You need an emotional investment in the characters in order to care what's going to happen when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan, and these characters don't have enough depth. Plus it's all very predictable...if you watched Boiler Room you have an idea where the film is going to go, but even that didn't pay off, because the downfall is too abrupt. And it's hard to feel sorry for Vaughn's character when he gets screwed at the end...he knew what he was getting into, he didn't trust the boss, and he was right, but he went along anyway. Very disappointing."
2,Earns the rite to find itself in Walmart's bargain film bin.,"I almost cared about this movie. Almost. I mean, you can't go wrong with Vince Vaughn and Ed Harris, right?Wrong.The Prime Gig offers slices of entertainment that keep you modestly plugged into the movie, but ultimately, those slices are not enough to suffice. Characters come and go without us caring, and the main characters look as bored as we do. Vaughn plays a conman who goes to work for a master con-artist and ultimately meets his match. There's some attempts to make us care along the way, and some dialogue that tries to assert itself, but at the end of the day, we still don't care and strike 'The Prime Gig' from the first cut at the ""Could Have Been a Cool Movie"" tryouts."
2,This Con's on You,"There are certainly worse ways to spend 93 minutes -- just check out your local multiplex. Shellgames are never boring, and the ensemble cast is great (as they nearly always tend to be, in con movies). But, as others have pointed out, this one has more holes in it than a shower head. Shares in a gold mine? Pur-lease! Where is any telemarketer supposed to find marks dumb enough to buy those? Why would any telemarketer worth his salt waste his time trying? And, given that the Vince Vaughan character makes it quite clear he's only marrying the girl to help her get a green card (and therefore presumably wouldn't have dreamed of putting his money in a joint account and giving her sole signature over it), what bank would be inept enough to let her clean out his account just because she could show she was his wife?"
3,Moving On Up,"An average movie about a small-time high-talent phone con man who gets a break and chance at the 'big time' in his professions. No more squeezing out twenty-five and fifty dollar orders after he joins on as a salesman at new firm hocking the next big investment deal to widows, retirees, and anyone with enough in the bank.Filled with quirky characters and stereotypes the office is the battlefield where only the best can hack it.A few rolls in the hay with the boss's chick and a couple of sales later the end comes crashing down.Nice idea, kind of cute, would not rent it again though."
3,"Interesting, but poor ending","The hook in these grifter/con man movies is to see which of the con men gets conned at the end, and how. All movies in this genre seem to follow that same plot structure. This movie does too, but it suffers by comparison with two other recent movies in the genre, ""Matchstick Men"" and ""Confidence.""What made those movies better, and this one worse, is that in those movies we can totally believe the ending, whereas here we can't. Although the set up is believable, the mechanics of the final rip-off do not seem possible. If they had spent just a bit more time and effort making us believe in the scenario whereby the con man finally gets conned himself, the movie would have been better. Instead, it ends with a whimper, not a bang."
2,dull knives,"I bought these knives as extras for when I have people over for a BBQ. The serrations are very large,the blades are dull and just tear the meat rather than cut it. For the price they work with some extra effort and as basically throwaways they meet the need, but if I was looking for day to day steak knives I would have sent these back."
1,Not good,"Others have written how good these knives are. Presumably one of three things happened in that case. 1: I did not get the same knives they did, 2: they got good versions of the junk I got, or 3: They were not honest about their comments. I do not know which it would be, but I can state, categorically, that these knives are pure junk. Not sharp, rip meat, loose handles that allow matter to seep under them, and leak water after the knife is dried. Two handles really bad, with cracks round the rivet and rough edges.If you receive the same knives I did, you will be truly sorry, even if they were inexpensive."
4,Roberts,Even an average Kenneth Roberts novel is a gem.If You haven't read Roberts before I would recomend starting with Northwest Passage or Oliver Wiswell first.
5,Elleander Morning,I read this book years ago when it was first published in paperback. I found it to be thought provoking in presenting the moral and personal dilemmas involved in the ideal of changing history.
3,Not the Greatest Phone in the World,"I first fell in love with this phone because it was compact and lightweight. That's about all I love about the phone right now. It has really bad reception, not to mention weird background noises on both incoming/outgoing calls. T-Mobile sent a replacement after I told them of the problem, but it's still the same. I would buy another phone right now if I had the money. The wallpapers provided are not the best, and neither are the ringtones. Sometimes there is a delay for the screen to show up when you flip open the phone.The phone is a nice organizer though. Alarms are loud as well as the ringtones. Screen is pretty bright. Buttons are nice and crisp. That's about all the good features of the phone. Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy this phone."
2,Beware if you want to sync with your PIM,"This is a nice little phone with a good color screen but the IR port does not work with any device other than a computer running Windows XP or 2000. You cannot pass info from another phone or from a handheld device into the E105 thru the irda port. And you cannot sync your phone with Outlook or any other PIM you may use, you can only copy the information into Samsung's EasyGPRS program for downloading into your phone. And the last problem I have with it is that each number is a seperate entry. You cannot have more than one number associated with a person without creating a seperate entry for each number.Nice phone but the functionality is very old school. It would be nice if they could have a modern software package with the modern phone."
5,Great sturdy little phone with a stylish look!,"I just received my E105 the other day and I must say that I'm more than impressed. It is much smaller than it looks in the pics and has steel casing. I was always worried about dropping a flip phone and doing extensive damage....nothing to worry about with this baby. The 65,000 color LCD is bright and clear! There aren't the best song selections for ringtones, but the polyphonic sound is incredible and loud. If you are looking for a phone with good reception, a stylish look, and a colorful screen this is the one for you. It doesn't have tons of features like some of the other Samsung models, but who uses all that crap anyway. I'm very satisfied!"
1,"13 months old, now doesn't work.","13 months old, now doesn't work. Shutting the flip lid will cause the lcd on the cover to shut off and causes the color screen to shut off, requiring restart of the phone. probably my last samsung mobile phone."
3,"It's OK, but my cheap nokia was better--for me.","I bought this phone from Cingular about 3 months ago. I still have not been able to use all of its features, because I do not understand what they are talking about, and Cingular is too busy to help (but they were not too busy to sell it to me). My son's contract with Cingular is up in February, and he will take this phone. I am going to find a simpler phone with a different company.Some of the problems I have had are the volume and the phone's features. It waivers among too loud, scratchy, and non-existent. Also, the instruction book is NOT specific enough for me, and this limits my usage of the phone. And this is a very tiny phone--in the beginning I lost it frequently, and I had to dial the number to find it. The battery life is OK.And I LOVE that I can call people all over the United States for FREE."
1,"Great for Kids, Embrassing for Everyone else","I bought this phone a few weeks ago, and have been frustrated ever since. Besides the bad sound, it adds a hum to the voice.The menu system is extensive and therefore ridiculous to use. Too many options to make this phone useable.Ring Tones? great for kids, but there is no simple standard ring tone that sounds like a phone. I have contacted customer support on a few occassions, and no one has given me any direction as to where to find a simple ring. The only option available is the T-Mobile melody that you hear on their commercials. They dont seem to realize that not everyone wants to play music. I cant find, download or buy a simple ring.I'm counting the days till my contract expires."
1,AH!,"okay, i had this phone for like...6 months and it was fine in the first month of so, but then..the battery kept dying, like every 5 inutes. seriosuly, well..i last it like last week so i bought a new phone, the mototrola v551, which is bigger, but a lot nicer, with more features, and i hope the battery stays good! AH dont buy this phone!"
3,"Small is good, but come on ...","Cons: (Coz i am all about cons!)1) Bad reception, compared to Nokia 6010 (same service same place, E105 fails whereas Nokia goes on)2) Only one alarm (one daily and one one time)am used to 3 alarms or atleast a snooze option3) it takes too long (at least 3 key strokes) to change the ringer volume, plus it rings as you change it, (irritating)3) Bad ring tones to start with4) is not as easy to flip open with one hand as the other models5) well ... it does look a lil girlishpros: well .. just to be fair and defend myself here ..1) nice n light2) hides in your pocket3) overall great reception when outdoors or in the city"
2,A TOY phone wannabe,No speed-dial preview on screen... No icons on phonebook list view... Long phone book initialization wait... No voice dial... Caller ID on front but no reject button outside (open to reject...so much for open to answer)... way too many keystrokes required to be considered user friendly as a phone. Samsung makes great phones for Sprint so it must be that the fools at T-Mobile need to stop marketing to the video game playing market and get serious about making a phone! My suggestion would be to look elsewhere if you want a serious phone. I am sorry I switched phones and carriers.
2,Software not as user friendly as nokia,"I switched from ATTWS Nokia to T-Mobile E105.I like the overall sound quality, the color display, good battery life and the fact that it is a flip phoneI don't like that:The software is not as easy to use as a NokiaThere is no way of switching profiles to meeting or silentThe vibrate+ring feature is very inconsistentEven if I select a ringtone, it will switch back to the T-Mobile jingle for no reasonTakes a long time to initialize the address bookTakes 2 keystrokes to dial a #Not sure whether it adjusts the time automatically if I travel to the east coast"
2,Word of warning.,"It appears after about a year to a year and a half these Samsung phones lose their screens. Replacing my Samsung S105 phone because of this issue as well, Seen someone else on here have the same problem as me with the E105. Going with a different phone this time. If it wasnt for this problem I would rate these phones highly, but without the screens it makes it into just a regular run of the mill phone with no options. And a pain to have to power it on and off after about every other use."
2,MOSQUITOES!,"WELL, THE PHONE IS NICE, BUT T-MOBILE IS HORRIBLE. I HAD A BUZZING NOISE IN THE BACK OF THE PHONE AND I HAD TO TALK TO 3 REPS BEFORE THEY WOULD SEND ME A NEW ONE. I KNOW OTHERS WITH THE SAME PHONE AND THEY JUST COME WITH MOSQUITOES INSTALLED IN THEM. PHONES A LITTLE SLOW. NOT VERY DURABLE. BUT OTHERWISE OK. I WOULD NEVER GET IT AGAIN THOUGH."
4,good economic phone,"PRO: strong signal, clear-cut reception, lightweight, user friendly, sturdy built, best of all is ""made in Korea"" not China.CONS: just adequate features compared to other higher end models, but if you just are casual type, you won't need those extra bells and whitsle, screen is not as vivid as E315."
2,"Not a bad phone, but not the best.","Over all I'd say it's a good phone. When I got it I wanted a camera phone but could not afford one so got this one instead. I have not had any problems with it other than it lacks some of the things I look for in a ceel phone such as*Camera*Speaker Phone*Being able to change the face plate w/o a screw driverAlthough I can change the faceplate myself it's a hugh hassle and I have to fight w/ it everytime.I love the it has the HIFI ringers and tha you can change the ""service light"". Another thing that sucks about it, is that it is so easy to scratch. I drop my phone quite a bit.. and it looks horrible. It still works great though. I've had it since November and will most likly keep it for around another month and than upgrade to the Motorola V300 since it has a camera and speakerphone."
2,looks good works bad,This phone is nice and small and has some neat features but the sound quality in general is poor and the sound fades in and out.The phone is not exactly Irish tough either.
1,Very disappointing,"Pros: Lightweight and slimCons: Can't see the screen in daylight. Don't buy this phone if you plan on using it outdoors(and who doesn't?). You can adjust the brightness but it doesn't help. As other users have mentioned, the ring tones are juvenile and useless. I also agree that the menus are slow and the phone sometimes takes a while to catch up. External caller ID is very small and hard to read. Not very good sound quality on phone - sounds ""tinny."""
3,Not what it should be for the money,"This phone is OK, just OK. These are my gripes: 1. the alarm has no snooze option, 2. you can't see the screen in the sun at all, and 3. the ring tones are as lame as they come. There is no simple ring tone, like a phone, they all have people singing or counting or cats meowing or someting stupid that would only be cool if you are in high school.If these 3 issues did not exsist, I would give this phone a 5."
4,Great All Around Phone,"This phone has all the needed features for a stylish and yet very useful flip cell phone. It does not have some wanted features such as assigning ring tones to individual callers, but all in all this phone does more than i thought it would and i love it. One word of advice, make sure u get a good plan. Trust me!!"
4,good midline phone,"I got this phone in the end of December. My previous phone was the similarly-sized Motorola v66. All in all, this phone is about the same as that one. Reception seems to be good and the ring and voice volumes are superb. the color screen is a very welcome change. The only gripe that I have is that it doesn't have all the nice features of some of the other phones (voice dialing, camera, bluetooth). I was seriously considering the SE T610, but decided against it becuase it was not a flip phone. Also, I can't seem to get the infrared port working. I got my computer to detect it, but I was not able to send any images or files to it. I agree with earlier reviews that the ring tones are a bit annoying."
2,Poor Poor Screen quality,"I had a S105 before this which was more substantial and also a tri-band (this is a dual band). This seems to have cheaper construction overall. Tinier buttons than the S105 AND A MUCH POORER Color screen. Impossible to read in daylight.Has ""hidden"" feature not in the book. If you bump the volume while it is ringing, it will send the call to voicemail. There is no way to shut this feature off.Sound quality is decent but give me back my S105!!!!(I had to trade it in for this thing)."
2,Be careful where you buy this phone,"A T-mobile station in Milpitas California charged me $200 for this phone,(...) Shame on me.I used a Treo 270 before (more on that elsewhere) and this phone as a PIM is a joke. The Samsung software just does not work consistantly. It has crashed my XP system twice (blue screen of death)It is a cute phone, and is flexible in tune download for ring tones, and I like the AIM interface."
3,Good and reliable phone,"It works, gave no problems as of now. I've been using the phone since 4 months. I liked the sleek built. I didn't like the default ringtones. You can hardly read from the screen in the sunlight."
1,Worst Phone Ever,"I have this cell phone for 7 months, and i can say that it is the worst cell phone ever. I have'nt made one call with this phone without the person on the other side of the line complaining abt poor voice quality. The phone goes in a slumber when i send or delete a sms. i had a nokia 3595 before, it is not as sleek or trendy as this phone, but it was a great cellphone."
4,I Like it.,"I got the E105 last Christmas, (free) through an online deal. I upgraded from an old school Nokia and just wanted a cute little flip phone that wasn't so obsolete. Sure, there aren't as many features on this phone as there are on others, but the basics the phone DOES have (such as receiving and making calls) work just fine. I like that this phone has a larger color screen than some Motorolas or Ericsons. The ringtones are a bit tedious and off the wall, but I've downloaded other ringtones that sound great. I've read other reviews where people are upset and irritated because this phone doesn't have the features they want, or it's so time consuming to get to the screen they need to get to, etc. I honestly don't have this problem. Reading the manual helps. I also read a review that said the phone will not charge unless it's off. NOT true. It's a good basic phone, light weight, and hey, I got it for free. I like it."
4,bare-bones,this is a good bare-bones phone. it doesn't have a camera but it does just about everything else. the external screen isn't color but how often do you look at that anyway besides checking the time? its major plus is that it's tiny and weighs nearly nothing.
4,Great but...,"Overall, I'm thrilled with this phone, because it excels at the 2 criteria that are by far the most important to me: pocketability, and reception/voice quality. I've been very happy with T-Mobile, too,Worst drawbacks to me:- Clock isn't automatically synched to cell towers, and loses ~3 minutes/month.- Lack of easy porting of Outlook contact info- Inability to store notes on the phone. Only way to do this is to text message yourself, but can't put a subject on the text message, just an automatically assigned 3-digit number.I like the vibrate before ring mode, but would prefer vibrate, then vibrate & ring. WAP's too slow, small and cumbersome for me to bother with. Voice activated dialling would be nice, but speed dial does the job. A non-fancy (ring-ring) ring tone would have been nice, too.YMMV depending on your needs, but for me, I'd buy it again in a flash."
1,CLOCK DOES NOT AUTO-UPDATE,"I'm not sure if it is just the fact that this phone is on a T-Mobile GSM network, but you have to set the time by hand. If you travel, your time will be incorrect. Give me two cans and a string. Very, very ghetto...I wish I hadn't canceled my verizon phone. SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT LISTING THIS PROBLEM AMAZON!"
2,Don't buy this phone,"I received this cell phone in Febuary, and I loved it. The colors, the sounds, everything. And then, four months later, it doesn't work very well. The screen doesn't turn on right away when I flip the phone open. It shuts off in the middle of conversations. The reception is awful. AWFUL. It seems like it is just put together poorly. Good luck if you buy this phone."
1,More Cons than Pros (Automatic Shutdown Problem),"I got my E-105 phone in December 2003 and within 6 months, i have to get my phone replaced twice because of the following problem.The Phone Shutsdown after i talk and close the flip. This occurs randomly. I guess its because of a short. The same thing happened in the replacement phone also. The only good part about it is the T-Mobile Service. They were patient to hear my concerns and send a replacement phone."
1,"great for kids, horrible for professionals","besides everything written before me, the biggest negative for this phone is that the rings are horrible. If you want a song, then great, if you want a ring, you're out of luck. The only option is the t-mobile melody, outside of that not a single simple ring.The makers seem to forget all about people who want a simple phone that rings and makes phones calls. All the other options are fun and games, but completely worthless in a phone."
3,Decent,"In this book, King lost some of the writiing that has made him one of mmy favorite authors. I was introduced to King's writing through ""Desperation"" which I believe to be one of the best books I have yet to read. This book is lacking."
5,"An amazing work, Stephen King does not disappoint.","When I read ""It"", my overactive imagination instantly kicked in, and I read for several sleepless nights, gripped by the amazing story. Since then, I've read and re-read this novel, and each time I'm amazed at how well it flows. 100 pages seems like 10 as King leads you along the path of these teenagers. Scary and suspenseful, this book is a must-read."
2,One of King's poorest works.,"The original concept of the novel is quite exciting: a group of adults return to their hometown, where the nightmare of their childhood haunts their dreams once again. This idea is enriched with all of King's standard schemes: '50s & rock'n'roll, the misery of the countrylife in Maine, children with supernatural powers and a lot of magic. This story could occupy no more than 200 pages. Instead, the novel is unecessarily long and boring, with imcomprehensibly extended descriptions. Some parts of it (especially the final encounter with ""It"") are almost silly. I think that the author attached various pieces he had written in other circumstances, for other works - some sort of his ""relics"". That's how I explain the apparent lack of cohesion. I don't say it's uninspried, but it's certainly uninspiring. Only for King's fanatics..."
2,Absolutely Terrifying And Sexist Tome With Insipid Ending,"This book was way too long. King crafted some very believable BOY children, but the role of the one girl was inexcusably offensive and exploitative. I have to admit that this is the most terrifying novel I have ever read. But despite its effective frightening powers, because of the bad plotting, outrageous sexism, lack of economy of writing, and horribly lame ending, I have to give it only two stars. My hope is that King will rewrite it someday to salvage what is, underneath, an overwhelmingly scary and good book."
5,An Outstanding Work of Art!,"This is one of the scariest books I've ever read, hands down. No questions asked. King delivered once again. IT WAS WICKED GOOD!!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ,"Steven King is the best horra writers there is. They scare you to death yet they draw you in and are so well written and believible that you wont be abble to put it down. The big orrgy that went on at the end of the book in the sewer kind a got to me though. Also I live in maine.So it just made the book that much better. When he talks about places you live and places you have been. I recommend this book to any body who likes long books, and can apprecate steven king."
5,The story holds you in it's grasp until the last word.,"The novel ""It"" was by far the best book I have ever read. It is a powerful epic that takes you on a tour through the horrors of childhood and adulthood. The Characters are extreamly well developed that by the time you finish the book you feel as if you have lost a best friend. As the plot unfolds you learn of terrors that one town must face every thirty years. Although It is a rather lengthly story it remains excellent from begining to end. I highly recommend this book to all, even if you are not a King fan."
4,Creepy,"I had to keep the light on for this one. This book is King at his creepiest, as he delves into his mythology of the evil in the town of Derry. As the story begins, five adults have come back to finish the job they didn't as a kid and destroy the evil entity that has been murdering the people of Derry for centuries. This book was utterly frightening, get it for a great scare."
3,Surprise.,"I read this book after watching the movie many years ago. And I was in for a big surprise. I understand that movies deviate from the book but I really didn't expect a specific scene from a group of kids to take place. (If you read the book, you know what I am referring to.)"
2,not my favorite stephen king book,the begging of the book was pretty good. but the rest was just not at all good. but i will say that my favorite boook by stephen king is insomnia.
5,Totally amazing,This book is a must read for all king fans. It grips you and keeps you on the edge of your seat with crazy suspense. It makes you feel what the characters are feeling. Captivating.
5,"powerful, just another masterpiece by the ""king""","I have only read half of the book so far, and can already discuss its brilliantness.As opposed to some other reviews I've read here, I can easily read books like this one without lights on. I don't know; I even watched ""The Ring"" alone and it didn't get to me at all. I enjoy horror on some weird level that other people can't do.That's why I thought this was one of the most amazing horrors ever written.However, IT is mostly scary by the actual images and scenes it displays. Some people are more scared when being described something that is so perverse it scares them, such as some parts of ""The Shining"" the movie, when the main character gets stuck in a picture from long ago. Now that's scary.Over, the book is wroth every word of it, because that's SK's best power: to make every single word worth the book as a whole. Don't think too much of it: it'll be wroth your time. I guarantee it... heheheh."
3,Mediocre at best.....,"I have to say, I'm quite shocked and disturbed that so many people find this book ""the best they have ever read"". The whole thing is floppy and needs a good tuning to tauten up those strings. I won't dwell on this review; make the mistake that King made on his book. So that's it. Average. Horribly, horribly average."
5,"An epic, gripping horror tale!","Seven friends. Strangers, originally, now brought together by an unspeakable evil. How unspeakable? It doesn't even have a name; just It. But It lurks under the town of Derry, Maine, and has a peculiar taste for children. Seven children, however, defeat it...but not for long...It's back. And It's hungry. Together, the original band that fought It must return to Derry, discarding the lives they have made in their absence. However, It is more powerful than they ever imagined It could...Stephen King has struck gold repeatedly in his career. He's struck silver a few times; never anything less than bronze. I don't know if ""It"" qualifies as gold or not; you'd have to ask the judges. However, all that I can tell you is that ""It"" is a good novel. A long one, to be true, but it--""It""--doesn't read that way. It's Stephen King at his gripping, horrific, terrifying best. And that's pretty darn good."
2,"Boring, slow, takes forever to get through","I read this book in about 3 weeks, which is long for me, since I usually finish in about a week with a book. I finished the first 200 pages in one day and after that it went VERY slow. It could of been slimmed 200 - 300 pages and been fine, but I had to read boring interludes, and hear fifth graders swear constantly. I don't think it was realistic and the sexual references were sometimes needed, but mostly not. I think King was more worried about having a long book, than having a good one."
2,A long time coming,"I read this book many years ago when it first came out. At that time I remarked to friends that it was one of the best 200 page novels I had ever read. Unfortunately, it is over 1000 pages long."
1,Way Too Long,"Another of King's BIG BOOKS, that do in 1,000+ pages what any other author would do far more effectively in about 300. Nothing in the novel justifies the sheer length of this thing. It just goes on and on and on.To be fair, there are glimmers of King at his best. Nobody in America writes better about young people, especially children. And his skill at creating likable, interesting and sympathetic characters around whom to build his stories is remarkable. It is just that his method of taking pages and pages and pages and pages and pages to tell us everything about everybody gets to be wearing, and the plot machinations he puts these people through gets increasingly predictable, and the Confrontation With Ultimate Evil is simply uninteresting."
2,Bored to Death.,"I was assured IT is the most horror filled book of all. I was horrified, all right. Horrified at how boring it is.In fairness, some of the writing is sublime dream weaving, and much of it is ham-fisted typerwriter bludgeoning.IT makes a great door-stop.After posting my review, I waited a few months and read IT again. IT could have been a first-rate horror fantasy with plenty of pruning and tightening of the plot. There are wayyyyy too many irrelevant digressions and flash-backs and zzzzzzzzzzz. And the adults in the book are almost comatose when it comes to excitement about the wholesale slaughter of so many kids.King coulda made the Derry adults hysterical and clueless, that is deaf, dumb, and blind to IT but definitely excited about the Kiddie Killings. The kids coulda been their skirmishers.How did the graphic homoerotic scene get past the editors?"
2,Heartbroken...,"Sorry, I've tried...God knows I've tried...but I just can't like this book. There's a lot here to love, but King just throws it all away. It's that idiotic child gang-bang at the end; I just can't get over it. In the space of a few pages, King wipes out the thousand pages of goodness which came before, at least in my eyes. What the heck was the *point* of the scene, anyway? My God, an 11-year-old girl would probably be torn apart by something like that! To me, this book was like falling in love...and then being horribly betrayed at the end of the relationship. Without that little child orgy at the end, I would have given this book five stars, easily. Some people can get past it and still enjoy the book, but I can't. Call me a prude, but child sex ain't my thing...."
4,A must read for King fans,"This seems to be everyone's favorite King book except for me. It's great and a must read, but if King ever choose a time to ramble on and on (and on and on) this was the book he focused on. The last 500 pages were a marathon.That said, every King fan must run this race.My favs include - Pet Semetary, 'Salem's Lot, and Needful Things."
3,Freaky and Scary!,"This is an excellent spooky book, until you get to the end where it gets utterly ridiculous. Anyway, a group of teenage friends battle an evil force in their home town, and they vow to return if the evil force comes back. This evil force appears in the form of a creepy clown that will scare the bejeepers out of you!Well, guess what? The evil force comes back! All of the friends (now middle aged) are summoned together to fight the force again. This time they must find the core and kill it so it will never return.I was enjoying the friends and even the creepy clown. But what happens in the end (I don't want to spoil it for you) is a bit of a let down. It's like King just up and went off in a totally new direction.All in all, though, it was a typical Stephen King hair-raising, page gripper. Recommended."
4,It is magnificent,"Wow, what an epic.The book draws you in to the sinister world of Derry Maine so quickly, and deeply, that you don't want to leave when the last page is read.With a book so large in volume and scope each reader is bound to find faults with the story, but this world is so full of rich characters, these problems disappear into the pages and eventually vanish.I originally read this book in High School. After my first re-read 15 years later, the horror of the what goes on in the town of Derry every 28 years had a bigger impact on me. However, the adventure and wonderment I pulled from the story then, came flooding back again. The first half of the book is a coming of age story, with evil stalking the town as a backdrop. The second half of the book is a story of re-discovery and responsibility, with evil lurking closer in each character's shadows.Just a fantastic book that reminds the reader of the power we had as children."
3,Overdue in reading this one,"Haven't picked up a King book in a few years but was pleased by this one. I'd put it on the level with his older stuff, flushing out his back catalog is a better way to spend your time than reading some of his newer works. Slow out the gate, but picked up the pace in the middle of the second act. Can't wait to track down a copy of the movie to compare it."
1,One of the worst books.,"It's over 1,000 pages, but a little editing could bring it down to less than 500 without removing any important details. I forced myself to read the whole thing, and wish I could have just let it go. Especially after I read the scene where the 11 year old girl in the group uses herself in the worst way to bring the group together. That scene served no purpose. I'm not a feminist, but it made me angry to see a writer use a young female character like a cheap blowup doll."
1,"IT delivers forceful horror, if you don't mind its crassness","I read this book after being impressed with Stephen King's ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."" I was captivated because of King's ability to write engaging and believable characters. He does this even moreso in ""It"", but many of the characters are crude, crass, and have very little morals. In fact, it is sometimes hard to respect them as ""the good guys,"" simply because they aren't very good(main character Beverly, age 11, having sex with the six boy ""good guys"" as a way to save their lives is a disgusting case-in-point) Aside from the crudeness of many characters and plot-devices, this book is very well written with a satisfying ending, and lots of runaway-train horror along the way. If you can stomach It's crassness, this makes for a five-star read."
1,What about the last 200 pages,"I read that book in only 2 days, which says enough about the page turning effect this book has. But after I finished, I wanted to rip out the last 200 pages or so. The plot is so wonderfully intriguing and then this thing which would be called a gang bang in a sex-film.With children? And this comes from a country where great literature like(Nobel- prize winner) Günther Grass` ""Blechtrommel"" is forbidden due to a small man(about 3 feet high) of age 20(! ) having sex with a girl of his age. IT gets 5 stars for the story and 4 stars off for the ending."
5,IT,This book was so scary!!! And belive me when I say that not everything in this book was put in the movie and for a reason. You might be shocked when you read it. I loved it. You should buy it right now!!!
4,"FIRST YOU READ, THEN YOU DIGEST, THEN YOU ENJOY","It's been a while since I've read this book, but I do remember that there were very few parts that got my senses reeling ON THE SPOT. Just like you can't expect to be drunk immediately after swilling down a beer in 15 seconds or less, you have to finish the book and process it first and then the effects take place. And, boy howdy, does this book have EFFECTS once you've digested them! By the way, if they HAD to do a miniseries (which was awful), they should have made it a four or five episode deal like ""The Stand"", as there were too many vitally important details cut out of the one they DID make, thus ruining it for those kinds of people who decide on whether or not to read a book by its movie. Fortunately, I wasn't one of those people."
5,King's best ever!!,"This book was the scariest, most well developed story that King has ever written. The plot and characters were well developed, and Pennywise was very scary."
4,"I don't get ""It""","But seriously, in response to that notion of""getting there is half the fun"", in the case of It, getting there (the end) was most of the fun; I simply dig King's style of prose and narrative. But the conclusion of It (and in retrospect the entire plot) seemed silly, to me anyway. If anyone thinks this book is bad, however (or especially if good), stay away from the mini-series"
5,"""IT"" is right up there with ""The Stand""","I read ""IT"" right after having read ""The Stand"" Right from the beginning I identified with the kids. Me being from small town New England, I knew the town that King was creating for the readers, I read in awe as the characters returned to face their individual monsters, i felt there fear and rejoiced at their tryumph.This is most definatly one of King's greatest works ever, a great horror romp with a deeper purpose of facing one's ghosts. I think it will stay with me forever"
5,Stephen King's best book ever!,THIS IS STEPHEN KING'S BEST BOOK! A MUST READ! The characters are so real that you feel that you are right there with them. The scenes are so scary that you should read during the day! Stephen King's #1 bestseller is one that you should NOT miss out on!-**Anonymous*
2,mislead,"thought i was buying a hard cover full size edition of this book, from like a book club type of publishing house. I have purchased a similar hard cover version of ""the Stand"" where it was normal hardcover size but would never be worth anything more than what i paid for it, which is fine i enjoy reading hardcover. What i got was a paperback sized book with a hard cover, so the type face is real small and if you have ever read this book you know it over 1000 pages and in this format it is actually harder to read than a regular paperback version. The product did display the dimensions on the page but who really looks at that when buying anything other than furniture or appliances? guess i will next time.Story is incredible and any fan of King will put this one at or near the top of their favorites."
3,Great witing and plot..Can't deal with child porn scene,"I love Stephen King's writing and the plot of It. I thought it was scary, dark, and I never felt like the scenes were boring. I would have given this one a 5 star review, but the scene (!!SPOILER SPOILER!!) where Beverly Marsh (11 years old) takes off her pants (after crawling around in garbage and human waste in the sewers) tells the boys (6 of them) to line up so they can all have sex with her. I could understand if this was written in a way that does not condone this behavior, but SK is trying to connect this scene with positivity. Like the ultimate friendship circle. I know this story is fiction, but child sex/porn should never be acceptable in literature or movies. Anyone who admits to ""liking"" this scene is sick and should never be left alone with children. With that being said, I will still buy SK books, but I will thoroughly read the negative reviews before I buy."
5,The Best Book Ever,"I'm only fourteen years old, and I read IT. I thought it was the best book that i have ever read. Then i saw the movie. I was horribly upset by it. The book was 100x better than the movie. So for all of you who did like the movie, read the book so you know the whole story."
4,PERFECT!,"OK, first off, I despise Stephen King books. I saw the film and fell in love w/ these characters, ran out & bought this book. I've read it every year since. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough. The characters will stay w/ you forever. If you never buy any other novel by King, may It be the one."
4,One of the King's Best,"This is far and away Stephen King's best novel - but not his best writing if I can compare it with novellas where The Body (Stand By Me) and Rita Heyworth and The Shawshank Redemption would rank ahead of this. So it is his best horror.Yet I have never seen this is truly a horror book. Cujo, The Shining, Christine, Carrie - those were horror. There was an element of horror here and yet this book is not ABOUT that somehow. The predominant theme in this book is friendship - the overpowering love that can exist between close friends. This love never dies, it lives their whole lives. King truly put a part of his soul into this book as he weaves a heartwrenching tale that leaves me still thinking about it 13 years after I have read it."
1,Very Boring Lacks Terror,"This book was way too long. The beginnning was exciting but the rest was very boring. Way too much swearing also. If you want terror, read Carrie by Stephen King."
1,Boring,"This is the first Stephen King book that I actually closed 2/3's through because it was so boring! It was an actual chore for me to read this book. I only kept reading because I was hoping the story would turn around somewhere along the line and become entertaining but it never happened. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this book to anyone because I didn't enjoy it at all."
1,This book turned me off Stephen King,"I hate to say this, but this is probably the worst book I've ever read. Reading the Amazon reviews, it doesn't surprise me that people have read it 10-20 times. You HAD to in order to figure out what the heck was going on! I nearly cried at the end -- partly in joy for having finished it... partly in sorrow for the hours I lost reading it. I haven't read a Stephen King book since I read ""It"" years ago. I used to love his books, too... *sigh* Hopefully I'll get over ""It"" one of these days and rediscover King's work, like the scary-as-hell Pet Sematary. Now THERE'S a great book!"
1,Needs editing BADLY,"This book was written when Stephen King had become a household name--and it's clear his editor was either intimidated by King's growing reputation or just horribly lazy.""IT"" is ridiculously long and burdened with with an excess of characters and an excess of dreary, self-indulgent verbiage. Scenes that should have been startling and tight are dragged out for pages and pages and pages. I don't know if King was deep into his cocaine addiction by this time, but the book certainly reads like it was written by someone sky-high on coke and completely out of control.Avoid this book. Reread classic King instead: the admirably concise Carrie or The Shining (which rarely drags and earns its length)."
5,"so long, sleep!","If you didn't think clowns were creepy before this masterpiece, you'll never see them the same way again. A brilliant cast of characters with real motivations and believable supernatural events, King is a genius at getting you to willingly suspend disbelief. Long live the King."
4,It is a masterpeice!,"It is the first Stephen King novel I have read. I was not scared by the length, as I have read Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. Anyways, this novel is a great read, as It is different for everybody, and thus people will be scared and see It as their worst fear. I won't ruin the book if you want to read it (pun intended), so just go out and buy it. I took about a week reading It, but I was hurrying and it was so engrossing I found myself reading for hours late into the night.Overall, an amazing book. Read It."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"I originally read this book in my early 20's. At the time, it was the scariest book I'd ever read. I was sweaty palmed and loving it. I decided to re-read it recently, and now the ""scary"" bits seem ready-made for cheesy horror movie special effects. However, I do still admire King's ability to create full-blown characters that are easy to care about.Note: I bought the Kindle version this time and found some formatting problems that were occasionally distracting. Just thought you should know."
3,IT,"I enjoyed this book, great characters and enjoyed getting to know each one. Thought the ending was a little rushed, but loved the story about the kids growing up and the nostalgic aspect of this book. I do wish the ending was explained a bit more... eg turtle. Some parts were hard to read, but I am pleased even though, that I read IT."
5,One of my alltime favorites,Fantastic story and super creepy. I loved this one from the first page to the last.
5,A MUST Read,"I am not going to go into much depth beyond my title. I usually only read reviews of books with 1-3 stars, but in this case, i have read this book 2 times over, and have to say that most of the horrible ratings are from people who shouldn't be reading King in the first place.From experience I can tell you a horror story is the most difficult to write and I assure you, this book will GRIP YOU, I stopped reading it before bed for a while because it was messing with my dreams. It is that powerful, you will be IN this book, you will become the characters and feel strong emotions. Yes the movie [was bad], but this is a must have. Work past the (minor) typo-s, obviously the publisher was a little preoccupied while reading this. Enjoy"
5,This is IT,"This is one of the most incredible Stephen King books written. The first time I picked up this book I could not put it down, his writing is haunting, creative and smart and his books just get better and better each read. King is a page turner one where your eyes stay glued to the page from beginning to the end. I can go on forever reading king and his imaginative style. But as much as I like King I also would like to highly recommend another author I have just read, great read, great book...check it out!!!!Dysfunctional (The Root of Betrayal)"
5,SCARY!,"The movie (which I witnessed at the age of 8) was bad enough, but the book is really grueling. It shatters your reality, at least while you're reading it. Do not read if you're one of those poor people who couldn't get a shower after watching A. H's 'Psycho', 'cause this tale is infinitley worse!"
4,It was frighting and exciting.,I thought it was great because of the spine tingling climax at the end of part one and the excitment at the end where they finally think that pennywise is DEAD!
3,This book was interesting and scary.,"This book was interesting , scary , it was an edge of your seat thriller that kept you wanting to read it."
5,One of the best books you'll ever read!!,"It is like downloading a game off the internet. This book takes awhile to read, but it is worth it. You will be looking under your bed every night you read this book. It is scary, but yet so captivating that you will ever want to put it down. A story which confronts childhood horrors head on."
5,Worth all the days it took to read IT.,"I was lost in this book. I only wish that the Turtle had not died. Very, very, scary."
5,a book to be read over and over,"""IT"" was one of the first king books I read,he described so vividly the awe and spirit of a childhood. The age when using your imagination and creativity was such a large part of growing up. The whole story in general was excellent, but I think the part I liked the most is remembering how simple and adventurous a childhood can be without video games and T.V."
5,No words or reviews can express what this book does to you,"If there is any book that is worth reading 1000 pages, this is it. if you dont know stepehn king's writing, then you dont know what your are missing. this is definitly THE most interesting and fasanating book i have ever read, and i do read alot. this book will force u into reading for hours without even feeling u spent 5 minutes ! if u like good scary, mind-twisting book, this one is for you !"
5,..we all float down here Georgie..,"On of King's best without a doubt, a tale of forgotten child hoods, horror and suspense. This keeps you reading till the very end (and it is long).This is really scary stuff, If like me you thought books could never affect you in that way, then try this one.I'll never pass a drain the same way again.. Or stay near a plug hole for too long either."
4,It is the most interesting book I have ever read!!,"I loved It, it is the first Stephen King book I have read. The best part of this book is how IT and the town, Derry exist togther, like the way Pennywise the clow was present at all the horrible events that happen in the town throughout Derry,s history. The reason I only give it four stars is because I found having the kid Bev have sex with all the little boys was unneccisay and gross"
2,a book with possibilities that evaporated at the end.,"king did a good job developing the characters in this book. the story builds and builds.....then he does not know how to end it. i don,t like reading long books just to be disapointed. mite be a good idea to not get so carried away with the story that he doesn,t know how to end it. stick to less fantastic plots. i tthink he outdid himself in a negative way. i like lots of sk's books but not this one!"
2,Way too long...,"I checked IT out from my local library a while ago and started to read it. The first 200 pages or so were okay, but once you get deeper into the book, it gets more tedious and boring. By page 410 I had stopped reading IT all together and returned it to the library. Some parts are very interesting, while other parts will drag and drag until you almost go nuts. The basic story of IT is about 7 kid's who discover a big secret:... It's much more than that of course, but that's the overall idea. The book is extremely long at about 1,138 pages. That is ridiculous, how can anyone read that many pages??? Overall, if you're a fast reader and can survive through many pages of detailed explanations (and not to mention tons of profanity) then please, get this book, but if you're like me and are a slow reader and find it hard to picture something that the author is trying to describe, then skip this book and read Misery."
5,Worth reading - I love it still.,"I think this was the first book I've ever read by Stephen King, and I still recommend it all the time when people ask me about a good read. It's definitely scary, but definitely amazing. When I was younger, maybe around 5, my sister had me watch the movie (cruel, it was, at 5). I was terrified for a long time after that. I wouldn't go to the bathroom alone. Then, when I was about 17 I read the book. I was scared again (not as badly, of course)and would eye the drains when I was near them.It is written amazingly and you will feel connected with the characters.100% worth reading."
3,IT could have been better,"This might have been the best Stephen King could have ever written, unfortunately it went awful at the end. I gave it three stars because the first 500 pages were good, but it starts to be boring at page 600. I think it could have been better if it had been only 600 or 700 pages long. I am sure many fans will read or have read this book and most of them gave it 5 stars which absolutely it does not deserve. I have only read like 22 books by Stephen King and I can say that It is not the best I have read from him."
4,Great Book!,"This epic horror novel tells the story of seven teenagers who encounter a horror that lives in the sewers of their hometown, Derry, Maine. They fight this demon in 1958 and again as adults as they try to kill it, but can they? This book is a horrifically gripping book that features good writing,construction, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. This is truly one of Stephen Kings best books in my opinion. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars and anyone who enjoys horror or sci-fi books would enjoy this epic novel."
4,Are you scared?,"I've always been a King fan. My Mom started me on his books at a young age. The first time I read the book I was fairly young maybe 10 or 12, so the story was not real clear then. I've read it and saw the movie since and feel it to be a very good story. Everyone has a childhood fear and a lot of people are very afraid of clowns. For the fear in this book to be a clown and be so utterly terrifying gave me chills. Since this is my genre of chioce I love to read this book when I'm in between books."
3,Good not Great with a horrible ending!,"Where do I start. It's not really a horror novel, but a coming of age novel about friendship. I was never scared or freaked out by the book and the ending is just the worst. I won't tell you about the ending, but I could've wrote a far better ending then that. It was almost like reading a Harry Potter kids novel...Disappointed."
2,"Too long, too boring","this book was way to long, I found many places in the book where King could of finished, this is not one of my favorite books."
2,Stupid.,"'It' is supposed to be one of his best works, but I couldn't finish it. I thought it was stupid. I stopped at the moment where The Creature from the Blue Lagoon appears and starts attacking one of the characters. How silly!"
3,Indulgent,There is nothing wrong with this book that snipping out 700 pages wouldn't fix. Indulgent.
2,"DUMB!,OVERLONG!,OVERWROUGHT!","The first novel I ever read was Carrie it was flawless! unfortunately things went down from there. For some reason Mr. King thought that by adding 500 to 600 pages to a story that's 300 to 500 pages long would make it better. WRONG! ""It"" the book is long winded, no exaggeration. He might as well put in the history of his characters first booger they ever picked all the way up to adulthood. King's trademark stock characters also lack believability (they're almost cartoonish) and they're in almost every book he's ever written. Read: Cujo, Gerald's Game, Pet Cemetary, Night Shift, Skeleton Crew, Carrie, Different Seasons, Deloris Claibourne, instead."
4,Win!,"Another win for Stephen King! I know I'm twenty-odd years late in saying that, but hey, there's a time and a place for every book, and 'It's time was now.Great rendering of childhood nostalgia -- even if I didn't grow up in the late 50's. This is the first time in a long time that a book has actually frightened me a little bit. I like to read in the bath, but after the scene in Beverly's bathroom -- I actually had second thoughts.Fantastic fantastic. Long but completely worth it."
4,Those Damn Clowns,"This book was phenomenal for Stephen King. He uses so much detail and visual effects, so you are able to actually see everything he discribes as you read it. I would deffinatly recommend this book."
5,"Evil Lurks in his eyes, the Clown they call PENNYWISE","Anyone ever heard of the band PENNYWISE? Well guess where they got their name? From this book! This book is so awesome, it is unbelievable. It took me like a month to read, but man, is it weird. The TWEAKED scenerio makes you feel as if you are a character! I highly suggest you read it!"
3,Not scary and boring,"I feel guilty giving this book three stars. I am being overgenerous simply to make myself feel better for putting so much time into reading IT. Stephen King can kill any suspenseful moment with excessive and unnecessary detail. That assumes however that there is suspense in the book. I almost feel that IT would have been better without the presence of the clown. Throughout the book you do develop a sense of closeness with the characters, only to be let down by a ridiculously boring ending and a total lack of terror."
5,"Beep, Beep, Richie!","It is the tale of seven children who are tormented by a shape-shifiting clown, only to be reunited twenty-seven years later to face It again. A beautiful horror story with emotion and pain that you feel. It's sad, it's funny--it's just amazing. Horror story are usually simple. This story is complex. It's not shallow like most horror stories. King at his best!"
4,It wasn't that bad!,"When I first looked at the book it was a little intimidating, a 1000+ pages might make you want to rent the movie, but don't. The book is one of the most descriptive and indepth books I have ever read. The characters; Beverly, Richie, Ben, Bill, Mike, Eddie and, Stan, are so real you feel like your a part of the Lucky 7. The way King has Pennywise (an evil clown who lives in the sewer) haunt or scare the kids is great. The story bounces back from 1958 to 1985, its a little confusing but you get use to it. It will keep you on your toes. When Mike find out that after 30 years pennywise is back, they all come together to get rid of him once and for all. When they were kids they all promised eachother that if he came back the would unite to get rid of him. The entire book was written flawlessly, The only complaint I have is the ending is to scattered with a bunch of things, I got confused."
3,Hard to Swallow,"My appreciation for this book was greatly influenced by its cumbersome length. I felt like I was trying to finish a 7 pound steak. Sure it's delicious, but after awhile you just get tired of chewing. Appearantly King never wrote a word he didn't like. It took him four years to finish IT and I respect that, but I don't think anything would have been lost by omitting some passages. Secondly, I was uncomfortable with the mature depiction of love and sexuality in his eleven-year old protagonists. I just kept wishing he had placed them in their teens. Lastly, IT in it's pseudo-true form was a bit anti-climactic for me."
4,Good But Too Long,"I liked the book ""IT"" a lot and their are many good parts. Still, this book is too long and it's not that I can't like long books because I loved ""The Stand"" complete and uncut. I stopped reading the book halfway through because of boredom. About a year later I picked it up and finished IT. Much of the middle section is boring and pointless. This book could have been much better if a hundred pages smaller.Still, I did finish the book and it was worth it. The end is good and the events leading up to the end are great. Henry Bowers was a very interesting characters, as well as others. The rock fight is the best part of this book and is one of those scenes that keep you reading. All in all a good book, but it could have been great if some of the pointless dribble in parts was eliminated."
3,"good, but awful ending","I first tried to read this book when I was ten, and had to stop after a quarter of the way through it scared me so bad. I just read it again now that I'm a little older and I found that I could handle the book a little better. The first 200 pages were still pretty freaky, but after that, it becomes more suspenseful than scary. It has very fleshed out characters, and a great plot, so why did I give it three stars? Well, the ending. I don't know what Stephen King was on when he wrote that ending, but it didn't help his writing any. For the last hundred pages or so (out of more than a thousand) he sinks into an incoherent ramble, complete with a oddly disjointed and vaguely disturbing scene of adolesent(sp?) group sex. A big let down considering the quality of the rest of the book. Read it, but don't expect a masterpiece."
4,A good story,"Stephen King's It is a very good and compelling story. Sure, it's riddled with the typical Stephen King cliches such as being set in Maine with a bully and a small group of outcast kids, and not to mention, the self-inserted hero who resembles King himself.But despite the apparent short comings this is still a very good, very disturbing story. The story is a little long winded but in the span of the story you grow attached to each of the characters and start to care about them and to stand with them."
5,this book was pretty darn good!,I read this book in about a week. King is great at developing the characters. The plot kept me entertained and the writing is just great. highly recommended
5,ONLY BOOK THAT HAS ACTUALLY GIVEN ME NIGHTMARES!!,"From beginning till end, I was completely captivated by this story. Never read a book that I enjoyed this much. BY FAR the best book I have ever read. Pennywise is one bad dude. I've never read a book twice, especially one this long, but this one was better the second time around. I will definately read it again."
5,Outstanding!!,"This was the first novel of the horror genre that I have read, and after hundreds of others, still the best. King intertwines the characters' pasts with the present for one outrageous ride!"
5,Phantastisch,"Ohne große Worte zu verlieren: ES gehört mit Abstand zu den besten Büchern die ich jemals gelesen habe (und ich habe wirklich viele gelesen). Die Story, die Charactere, das Umfeld - man taucht ein und möchte nicht mehr hochkommen"
4,This is the creepiest movie on the planet!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved Stephen King's movies ever since I was young. This got to be one of the best. I never got a chance to actually read the book, but I LOVED the movie. Its one reason why I don't like clowns anymore. Even though I watched it doezens of times, it still freaks me out. Its sooooooooo good!!!!!!"
5,fascinating,"Never have I experienced such a storm of emotions in one book.So much love,fear,desire,evil and innocence.I loved it's brilliant character sketches and King's mastery of depicting the beautiful awakenings of adolescence,particularly in his portrayal of young Ben's yearning for Beverly.The beautiful Haiku poem and the scene where he sees Beverly's gold chain flashing in the sun and his desire is truly born, are probably two of the loveliest scenes I've ever witnessed in a book."
5,We all float down here...,"Im 14 years old, I read the book when I was 12, I saw the movie when I was 13, and Im still scared of clowns... you never what might be lurking in the sewers... you might end up floating too..."
5,Be Warned,"This is a great book, highly recommended. I'm sure other reviews will tell you all about it. But, just so you know, there is a section that explicitly describes several 12 yr olds taking turns having sex with another 12 yr old prepubescent girl. There are actually many gross parts that aren't needed, like a little boy giving his friend (who's also a boy) sexual pleasure... Stephen King is a pretty sick individual. Not for the kiddies (whom incidentally make up about 75% of his fanbase)"
4,Stephen King's It,"This book starts out slow and the plot gets a little lost in all the description. It's a great book to read and scares the pants off you. The more you get into the story the more you are not able to put it down. The book jumps back and froth in time which can get a little confusing, but very interesting. I have seen the movie and I think the book is ten times better. The book explains more of what happens then the movie does. I really think this is a great horror book and is suspenseful. I really think you will enjoy it."
5,King becomes lost in his own story - as do we!,"This is the only novel by Stephen King I could easily reccomend to anyone looking for that ""truly absorbing"" read.I have read almost everything he's had published, but then I've read a great many books in my lifetime (I'm sixty-two years old), so that's not saying alot. Frankly, I've felt let down by King on many occasions, most recently with Dreamcatcher.With IT, the story seems to tell itself. Nothing seems forced to drive the plot, and the characters become vividly alive (something King often has a serious problem with accomplishing).When reading this masterpiece, I am utterly charmed by the lack of King's presense. It is as though he himself is so lost in the story that one can imagine he might have looked down at his typewriter on many occasions while writing it, surprised to find his fingers were typing out the words.This book simply pulses with life.DW"
2,All that for an ending that falls flat!,"I am a huge fan of Stephen King, but as far as I'm concerned, he dropped the ball on this one. Don't get me wrong; this book is as scary and atmospheric as anything he has written. Most of it is very good, and the length did not bother me until I got to the end. The payoff, where what ""IT"" is is revealed, was so lame and unconvincing (I won't say what it turned out to be, but it was an old, tired horror-movie cliche) that I was completely turned off. I couldn't help feeling that King spent most of the time he was writing this book with absolutely no idea what the mysterious monster was going to be. That's why the book starts out so well; as long as the mystery remains, it is a gripping, scary story. But when the time came to reveal the monster, I can't help but feel that King just couldn't come up with anything, so he threw together a slapdash ending and stuck it on the book to meet his deadline. a MAJOR disappointment."
4,4.5 stars,Read this book at a light warehouse because you will NOT want to be anywhere near the dark!!
5,An Epic Tale of Man vs Clown,"Seven nerdy-but-likable children, a psychotic clown, and the timelessness of childhood. These are all issues tackled by Stephen King's ""It"". Although quite lengthy (1100+ pages), it certainly doesn't feel that way when you sit down to read the book. The scenes are well sculpted, weaving together the events bewtween the Derry, Maine of 1958 and the Derry of 1985. All of the characters are well developed, and there's enough creepy stuff to keep you riveted. There are some more ""adult"" concepts(detailed sexual scenes), so I wouldn't advise it for younger children as a bedtime story, but for the mature reader looking for a thrill, it's a definate read."
5,"im only 14 and it was the best book iv read ever,",i never read a thing but i seen this book and i said man it looks good so i read it i could not take my eyes off it
5,Really cool book,"The book and movie were both really cool. I read the book for school and the teacher was impressed. People finally began to realize that I wasn't as dumb as they thought, because they don't have the power to handle such a stirring and awesome book. My favorite characters in the movie were the young Ben Hanscom, the young Richie Tozier, and the young Stan Uris. The movie was really cool. It made my little brother mess up his pants when he first saw it! He'd come crying and saying that he wanted to see some corny show. Only a wimp could not handle the book or the movie. If you want to read a really good book or watch a really cool movie, I suggest IT any day."
3,Last 100 pages earned IT a lower grade.,"This is one of the best King books I have read (The Shining being his best) and I wouldhave given this book 5 stars if not for the last 100 or so pages. The ending was extremely disappointing and I saw absolutely no point in the child gang-bang scene (Beside the fact of it being disgusting I failed to see how it saved them from their predicament). I also didn't really understand the role of the Turtle. Anyway, the build up of the book was excellent but the ending was very disappointing."
2,"Someone should have edited ""It""","Stephen King now has so much power as a bestselling author that I guess no editor has the nerve to tell him that his stories would be much more effective is he just cut out, oh, say three hundred pages or so. ""It"" isn't by far King's only example of literary bloat, just one of the more unfortunate. His pure horror works have become increasingly erratic over the years, though this was actually one of his scarier concepts. Unfortunately, it takes so long to get to the payoff that by the time it comes you scarcely care. King's biggest fear these days seems to be the ""Horror of the Black Marker."""
5,Stephen King's It,"The book is brand new, in excellent condition, and I received it well before Christmas."
2,Too predictable,"If anyone browsing through cyberspace gets to this review - I'll assure you that you're not required to read EVERYTHING published by Stephen King. I'd read nearly half the book - 500 Pages, only to discover that I already knew who the monster was, where it lived and exactly when it would strike again. Why finish it?"
3,It by Stephen King,"It was a very interesting book. It was a little disappointing towards the end because it gets less interesting. There are definetely some funny parts in it, the book is suspenseful. I would only recommend It for mature people. It's about a clown that goes around killing little kids every twenty-seven years. The clown can be recognized wearing a silver suit with orange pom pom buttons and orange tufts of hair. It goes by the name of Pennywise the Clown. It is a real page turner. If you enjoy books with imagery and suspense, then I would say this book is for you."
2,Crash!,"That is the sound that a Stephen King novel makes as it enters its final forty pages. King is almost unmatched in his ability to entice a reader into his stories, much like Pennywise the clown entices children to their death in ""IT."" Stephen King so often promises great rewards and leads the reader to believe that the end will be worth being engrossed in 400-plus pages of prose, but with the exception of ""The Stand,"" he lures the reader into his web and then rewards the reader with a fate worse than death by Pennywise, a wasted read. Could it be that Stephen King himself is the ultimate embodiment of evil to the reading world"
3,"Not the greatest work of Literature, but good...","I was curious as to how others reacted to this book I'd just finished, and was so surprised by the reviews I felt compelled to respond. Did no one else find the voyeuristic sex scene with the kiddies as absurdly offensive as I did? I'm sure it proved titillating to many, but my word, how typically male... she hurts at first, then gets into it and even moans, thrashing her head from side to side! I did find aspects of the book wonderfully exciting - the plotting, the return of both Tom and Henry - and will happily concede his talent at the game of suspense, but ""the greatest book ever""? ""The greatest writer ever""? Come on, folks. A great storyteller, perhaps (and even some of his devices are reading a bit thin), but I don't think we'll be assigning King in Am Lit 101 any time soon. To paraphrase Adorno, he won't be disturbing the currents of literature too much."
3,Decent but overated,"its an ok book but considering the length its not a very good bang per page. Also, a book has never scared me ever so maybe thats my problem. I thought the intro was pretty cool but some of the book just had some painful boring moments. Especially when they took you back in time to discuss some of derrys history. Also, I never cared about what happened when they were kids because you knew them as adults. If they were being chased you knew they werent going to die because they are adults now. I think that really hurts the book."
4,Good Book,This book is long and some parts are boring but overall it is a good book in my opinion. I really enjoy Stephen King's work. He is one of my favorite authors. If you enjoy reading somewhat scary novels I would recommend this one.
5,"It, My Favorite Book","Seven friends, one monster in many forms. Have you ever wondered what you're biggest fear is? Once you read It, you'll realize you have many. I started reading King in '96 with The Green Mile. I quickly became an addict and am almost through with all of his books. It is by far the most intriguing and haunting book I have ever read. The reader follows these seven children through things that would make a grown man scream like a little girl. Yet, maybe it is because they are children, they suffer through It not once, but twice. This book is scary and sad and funny. You experience every emotion while reading this and at the end you realize that you have completely fallen in love with Bill, Bevvie, Ben, Stan, Mike, Eddie, and Richie. My personal favorite is Ben. The movie version of this book is also good, but it can never compare to the experience of reading It for the first time. READ THIS BOOK!!!"
3,A very long winded read,"Maybe I'm expecting too much from Mr. King. Maybe I'm missing the point. I understand that he is a MASTER story teller. I appreciate how three dimensional his characters are, and I enjoyed the realistic dialogue. Some of the background stories were interesting, and some of them were pointless.The book was well written, but the constant time-warping was BEYOND tedious, especially in the last 200 pages. Overall, this was a decent book, but I preferred some of his earlier works to this for several reasons."
5,oh my god...,"This is probably the best book i have ever read. over 1000 pages of pure terror and thrills, and once this incredibly long novel is over, you still don't want it to end. too bad they made the mistake of making a movie out of it (what a piece of s***) but this book is amazing. The story is set in the typical town for most of king's novels: Derry, Maine. Children have been disappearing then turning up horribly mutilated by an unknown...thing. A group of 7 friends decide to combat the evil. After growing up and going their seperate ways, the thing returns and they must once again kill the thing known only as It. The characters are believable and diverse and king shows the parallels and diferences of the world through the eyes of a child and an adult remarkably. An amazing read."
3,Good book....,"IT is a good book but I'm sorry, the ending was stupid. It seemed like he was going good with the story and then had to finish fast.... I'm a King fan but, this book could have been a lot better!"
5,"LOVE HORROR BOOKS, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE!","If you like horror books, here is you chance. ""It"" is one of my favorite stories by Stephen King. This story sucks the reader in and you lose track of everything but the book. Stephen King's dialogue and descriptions are put quite well. In this story, my favorite character is ""it"", the clown, because he makes the story unfold and exciting. Sometime the story gets a little confusing because the writer switches back and forth between each character, telling about their childhood. I really think you should read this book. It's really not that difficult as you think. I would recommend this book to all you readers who like to read horror books."
5,The reappearance of the crazed clown is P-your pants scarey.,"Steven King's brilliant writing of the It was created by a childhood image of The Bugs Bunny Show. The book is written about seven men and women who return to their hometown to face their childhood memories of a crazed clown. In their childhood they had magical powers to fight the clown; and after going back to try and regain those powers, they realize they have to defeat the clown by themselves without any magical powers."
3,Imagination is a SOAG!,I swear that the monster I had in my head was so much scarier than that Tim Curry clown on the mini-series. Good book. Scary and typical Stephen King with a supernatural ending.
3,Talk about diarrhea of the mouth!,"I still gave this book 3 stars (it's still a decent book,) even though it could've easily been five stars if the author hadn't caught a horrible case of mouth diarrhea. He just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on with pointless details and pop culture references. This is a 1100 page book that should have been 700 pages or less. It would've been great then, but the author has to drag on and on and on. Don't get me wrong, I like King, but I'm not going to defend him when he makes a mistake. I'm no hippie, but doesn't it seem like King goes out his way to waste paper by putting in 400 pages extra of useless details? This would've been one the best if it were 400 or 500 pages shorter.Bottom line: Rent it from the library or if you do purchase it, save your receipt, it's only good for one read. After that, it's only useful as a doorstop. The Dead Zone, Night Shift and many others are better than this book, even though it's not without it's charms."
5,"Long, but still great...","This book could easily be in King's top 5 ever, and is as well as mine. Overall, the book is great, and the characters and story have lots of life and juice in em.Heres a very brief summary:Something is terrorizing the small town of, Derry, Maine, killing off kids. A group of brave friends known as the ""Losers"" seek out this evil and try to kill it. Afterwards, they make a blood promise that if It ever comes back, then they would come back and face it again. And what happens? 27 years later, kids begin to be reported missing suddenly, and some are even found dead.An unspeakable force is bringing the ""Losers"" back to Derry, Maine, so they can destroy It---once and for all.This is an extremely long book, exactlly 1092 pages, but if your a short attentioned span person, there is no need to worry.Even though u have ADD or whatever this book will grip u and not let go.Like quoted from the Los Angeles Times: ""Scenes to be read only in bright-lit rooms!"""
3,"Pretty Good, but not King's best","I have read most of King's books. I have to say that It is pretty decent. I enjoyed the character developments, both as children and adults, as well as the events when the children came back to Derry as adults. The only thing I did not like about this book is the interminable Derry Interludes. I felt these sections of the book were too long and dull. When I read the book now after my initial first reading, I skip the interludes and just continue with the rest of the story. I feel the interludes could have at least been shorter, and that would have made it an easier read."
3,Just ok,"Could have been shorter it was ok not really that scary I've always wanted to read this book since I watched the miniseries as a kid it's an alright read some of it doesn't make any sense though, the turtle puking up the universe for example amongst other things 11 year olds having sex as other reviewers have stated as a gang bang I didn't see it as that but still dis"
2,Publisher laziness,"This review will not address the content of the book, but rather the formatting of the Kindle edition.A publisher would never release a print edition of a book without thorough and repeated proof-reading. However, they seem to have no problem doing so with e-books. ""It"" contains numerous formatting problems (e.g. spaces between periods and closing quotation marks) as well as many typos. Spending time trying to decipher the text takes away from the enjoyment of the book.It appears that the publisher recently pulled the book to do a clean-up, and while that may have taken care of some of the problems it has a long way to go."
5,The Best of King,"I LOVE this book. I use this book as a measurement for all others. What other book can make a grown woman afraid to turn off the lights, literally laugh out loud, and shed actual tears all in one well written, well developed work? Please do yourself a favor and take the time to read this book! All of King's books are engrossing, but none (except maybe The Stand) touches this one."
2,Would have been twice as good with half the details,"This is the first Stephen King book I read, I am in my late 20's, and I found ""It"" quite disappointing. It's definitely not a masterpiece and not really scary.The story is about a monster ('It') that kills children; and a fellowship of 7 little children that decide to fight It. Language-wise it's an easy read, and the main story is kind of ok.The big minus of the book is the enormous amount of details that do not contribute much to the story. The passages of irrelevant details are so long, and the horror scenes are so sparse, that whatever thrill builds up from one horror scene evaporates until you reach the next one. Moreover, I can't help but think that the group-sex scene was a cheap trick for the book to attract attention."
3,Stand by Me meet H.P. Lovecraft,"Though not a great piece of literature, It does make for a good summer read. However, 200-300 pages could have been left behind. The repititios character description quickly becomes boring. (Richie's jokes, and Bill's stuttering are crucial to the plot, but annoyed me after a few hundred pages.) The best part by far is the supernatural presence. Clearly inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, the stories last chapters are the best. Though not for everyone, the final showdown with It becomes a weird twist of reality."
3,OK for King,"I really liked this book up to about the last third. Seriously, it is as though he just gave up. The end of this book ruins what was a masterfully crafted work up to the point where it simply falls off.You will like it, and then you will be disappointed."
5,Probably the best book King's ever written or likely to,"This is probaby one of the best scary tales ever written, a) because the central idea is so chilling in itself (and casting a clown as the main 'face' of It was pure genius), and b) because it is so many tales wrapped into one. This is one long book, but that is one of the best things about it--it shows just how deep-rooted the evil is in Derry, and makes the Losers' task all the more frightning. Trust me, you'll fall in love with the characters, but you'll never visit the circus again!"
4,"Problems with the ending, anyone?","I enjoyed this book too and at the number of pages it was, itwas the longest book I had ever read and quite an accomplishment to mewhen I finished it. Well, at least that's how it looks, from what can be seen. Despite this latter part, it was somewhat disappointing.Still, King has a knack for writing kids and their bullies like in the movie ""Stand By Me"" (yes, I'm saying this because he wrote the novella on which it is based, ""The Body""). They are really funny. Which is a nice contrast or companion to the horror he delivers."
5,Classic,"There is no book like It which combines horror, suspense, thrill, as well as deep psychological reasoning and intense character development. This book is everything you would ever want in a novel. Just don't read it when you're alone."
5,Best Book by Stephen King I've ever read,"I read this a long time ago and still remember most of the details. This book, as I recall, was around 1,000 pages and I could barely put it down. I was reading it, when I was 17, when my family moved from Oregon to Wisconsin. We drove. My father was the type of person that when he went to bed, we all went to bed. We were all in the same hotel room and I couldn't sleep because I kept wanting to get back to the book. I wanted to read it so bad that I grabbed a blanket and laid it down on the bathroom floor of the hotel room. I look back at that now and I think, GROSS! But that's how good the book was. Scarry! If you love a thriller, this book is definetely for you. It will keep you going until the very last page."
5,There are no words....,"This book is THE best book ever publsihed in any country. I have never read any book as scary as ""It"".. King gets into your mind and brings childhood horror to the surface of every single reader every chapter of the book. I have never read a book that stayed with me in such a way."
5,The only book ever to give me nightmares!!!,"""It"" is one of my all time favorite SK books.I read it when I was 17 and haven't forgotten it since-and that was 11 years ago!!The movie PALES in comparison to the book.And the most frightening part of ""It"" is that it can see into your mind,know what scares you the most,and-POOF!-it becomes your worst nightmare.Well,if ""It"" could read MY mind,it would take the form of a horror novelist named Stephen King."
5,"Excellent, King surprised me","This was one of the first Stephen King books that I read.I loved it so much, I have since read almost every book hehas in print. It kept me up way past the early morning hours. I just had tokeep reading to find out what the extremely exciting, in depthand original plot was going to bring up next. If depth is whatyou are looking for, go no further. King offers his best bygiving every detail in on of his greatest books."
3,It's OK....but not excellent,"If you like movies, you will get something out of 'Edit Music for a Film'. Dialogue and/or music from many movies is used, including Kill Bill, Space Odyssey 2001, Solaris, Almost Famous, Scarface, etc.Not a bad effort by Lavelle, but at times it gets way too repetitious. Sometimes many minutes pass without change to the samples or beats. Not the sort of thing you can listen to over and over again.Also, it would have been better to break up each CD into 'tracks' such that the less interesting parts can be skipped - if needed.If you are looking at purchasing an album as an introduction to UNKLE, then get Psyence Fiction or Never Never Land Instead."
5,great album,"Amazon keep up the good work. When I first heard this album I thought it was nirvana. I was thinking no way this rocks.R.I.P. kurt. We love you grunge master. Bracket you rule, Nirvana you rule. Grunge Forever Ziyen sucks.If u got a problam email me at punx4@hotmail.com peace love and the pursuit of grunge."
1,dear god this is horrible!!!,"This is probably one of the worst grunge albums of all time, oops i mean punk."
4,Audiovox Transmitter APS2K4SBCF50,"Exactly what it is - brand new, batteries are fresh - exactly the same as the ones I originally lost."
5,Rejoice with me,"What a great debut album. Mark's voice makes you feel right at ease from the first track on. His songs are Bible based and from the heart, a great combination for every one. This album is one that you will enjoy all year long as its message is timeless. I can't wait for the next album and the concert tour."
3,Come back to the USA,I got a little bored reading New Mexico. With Hanry Blake traipsing around Germany since the preivious book (Arizona)I am skipping over the parts involving him and his squeeze Giesela. The story line with Marjorie traveling on a whaling boat are ok.
5,One of the best!,This one of the best of the first Wagons West novels. Toby Holt's efforts to infiltrate and take down outlaw Calusa Jim are exciting. Henry Blake's storyline is also very entertaining.
4,Watch voltage specs,"I'm about to order some of these and the review above, though incorrect, did alert me to the fact that they make seemingly identical lights for DC and AC systems. The 8066 which is this light, shows as for 120VAC on BlueSea's own site at [...] -- as you see they have DC versions also. If you are ordering items like this, you should know the difference :) Just watch to be sure you're getting the right ones. And of course make sure they SHIPPED you the right ones.(I will adjust rating when I get mine installed)"
1,Screeching Weasel's steady decline,"If you liked Anthem for a New Tomorrow, you'll like this. If you liked My Brain Hurts or Wiggle, you might enjoy the first song on this album (which rocks, btw). Other than that, this stuff is rotten."
5,Its A Real Cool CD,"This Cd has some of Screeching Weasel's best tunes such as Cool Kids and Stupid Girl. If you like punk, and especially Screeching Weasel this is their one CD you must get if any other."
1,Hallmark-Type Boring Straight Movie of the Week,I was looking at gay films when this movie appeared along with other gay movies as a suggested film of interest to me. Naturally thinking it was a gay film I read the Amazon description and thought the struggle of 2 teens relationship to be gay and happy in a small town would be interesting. Wrong.I watched the film wanting to turn it off so many times because the story line was extremely boring but I was waiting for a gay teen to appear. The movie is about 2 straight teens. I was very dissapointed but so frustrated that the movie lacked any kind of intelligent writing or acting. The ending is quite laughable.This movie is as flat as the Texas landscape that they mention. I cannot find any redeeming quality to recommend this to anyone. I see the other reviewers gave this movie 5 stars and I wonder if they saw the same movie I did. I would actually give it -2 stars for wasting my time and money.
2,Please don't make me watch it again!,"The only ""gay"" relevance to this film is the real life orientation of out star Chad Allen.Moving on from there one can only say that the lead characters did justice to the roles they played and lines they spoke far above what they deserved.Kudos to Chad Allen, Marshall R Teague, Polly Cole, Tamara Clatterbuck, Shandra Farr, all of whom had at least one moment during this weepy trite epic of cliche riddled, breast beating, teeth gnashing melodrama.I'd rather slit my wrists than recount the events in this baby gets you married into the ""good"" family tumbleweed Babylon."
5,"Hilarious, intelligent, and believable as an autobiography of the master himself, Leonardo da Vinci","I read this book some years ago, and was very amused by the format of storytelling. If da Vinci had ever written his own biography, I imagine it would be very much along the lines of Mr. Steadman's version of the events in Leonardo's life. Hilarious, gross, intelligent, and with fantastic illustrations throughout. Considering Leonardo da Vinci's fascination with caricatures in his own art, he would definitely love this book."
3,Snuff sure do love the cover tunes,"Yes, it's another EP of mostly Snuff covers. Though this was released by Fat Records in 1996, it was actually originally released in 1990. Fun for the fans, but non-essential for anyone just getting into the band, though Snuff are indeed known for their cover tunes.As for the covers:2) Do Nothing, The Specials4) Can't Explain, The Who6) Reach Out, The Four Tops7) Hazy Shade Of Winter, Simon & Garfunkel9) City Baby Attacked By Rats, GBH8) and 10) are commercial jinglesStart with the proper albums first, then work your way to stuff like this and Potatoes & Melons (a latter-day covers EP)."
1,Bad snuff.,"I really do like snuff but i would go far enough to give this cd 1 star as it's just alot of covers and TV advertisments (which are the most annoying things in the world ever anyway) all bunched up together i listened to it once then sold it, word of advice buy any other snuff records just skip this one (the humours even tame)."
4,Great record,"This CD contains remixes from some old songs from nada and three tracks that have appeared on different compilations. These tracks are now included on the nada cd. The remixes are simular to the versions on nada, Behind the rose have a more industrial touch, like if you mix the versions of corn years and nada, she said destroy is a bit longer and includes some samples (from the old TV-serie the prisoner I've heard). The only change on Klaus Barbie is that it is renamed. All the songs on the record are great though and this cd can give a good introdution to the new Death in june fan, as it contains both sides of the groupe: the industrial and the guitar-based ""apocalyptic"" folk side. For the true fan it's fun to hear new versions of the songs."
5,"STAR DUST , a page turner","Frank Bidart's STAR DUST is something like a perfect book of poems. It has a beginning, middle and end and never stops being a good--which is to say gripping, even suspenseful-- read . The opening section of poems, a sequence called ""Music Like Dirt,"" works like a prologue to a collection of poems about making, about the project of being-in-the world through the lens of the maker. The final long poem, ""The Third Hour of the Night,"" about the sculptor, Benvenuto Cellini, is both a culmination of this meditiation and a subversion of the ideas put forth in the earlier poems. This is an unsettling, brilliant, beautifully made and deeply moving book of poems. And unlike many contemporary books of poems, it is direct, accessible and deeply interesting (the way novels are interesting) from start to finish. Yet it repays re-reading and study for its formal virtuosity and variety."
3,Nice radio,"I saw the black radio in the local Target store and thought it was really a beauty, and what a radio used to be (I'm a ham radio operator). What I really like about it is that it is continuously tune-able. If there is a heterodyne from a neighboring station, I can tune away from the noise.The sound is wonderful.I was surprised and a little disappointed to see that the radio runs with an external power supply that converts the house AC voltage to 12 Volts DC. The power supply has two long cords on it, and the supply measures 2 X 2-1/2 X 3-1/2 inches, and is a good weight, so you have to consider where you are going to hide it and run all the wire.Our local FM reception for the station I like, public radio, is very hard to select with these cheap digital-tuned CD and radio receivers we had before. It seems as though 90 percent of the local stations are religious stations with constant sermons and hymns, so I am glad to be able to get the public radio station."
2,too much base,"I too like the look and design of this radio/amp. I wanted it for a couple months but waited until I got it for Christmas. I was excited until I turned it on and heard the very strong base on FM stations, and more disappointed that it has no tone/base knob or adjustment. AM radio and plugged in iPods are fine because you can control the EQ, but it takes some adjusting. For morning NPR listening while making breakfast, I don't need something that reverberates through walls at low levels. Returning it."
4,Overpriced?,"I bought this radio, brand new, from a local store (not Amazon) for only $35. I can't write a review on the performance of the radio as I have not had a chance to use it yet. But it appears to be a small, basic, AM/FM radio with ports for AUX and headphones. Why does this sell on Amazon for over $70???Update: This is a nice, small radio, with good sound."
1,"Sure, it looks good.","Biggest mistake...I didn't return it. To tune this so you have a clear channel is impossible without hearing stations on either side of what you want. There is the antenna, but no help there, it's at an extreme downward angle and still the station's are ""noisy"", and I'm talking about the.FM stations here, AM channels do not come in at all. I do not recommend this radio at all unless you like the look and don't want to listen to anything."
5,beautiful sound,my brothers were so jealous that I got this radio for myself and not for themSound is great design is beautfulreviews about second antena are true depending on your reception
5,Big sound in a small package.,I was surprised at how small this radio was when I got it. I hadn't paid much attention to the dimensions. I was also surprised at the quality of the sound. I'm very happy with this radio. It's just what I was looking for.
2,"Agree with radio qualities, but ""wall wart?""",Very nice radio no doubt. Had to take it back due to extremely large AC adapter. With Tivoli (and others) the AC power unit is contained within the radio itself and there is just a simple power cord that plugs into the wall and the radio. Wasn't expecting a massive power transformer that sits outside the radio. This radio is for a countertop in the kitchen and having a major piece of hardware like an AC adapter trailing behind it sort of ruins the look. But...nice radio. Too bad about the adapter. [...].
1,won't stay in FM tune,I bought this radio a few years ago and loved the tone and look. But I found the FM reception to be terrible over time. I have different brand radio I can set up in the same location and the same day and it has no issues. The Crosley is constantly drifting and cutting out. Maybe component aging? Maybe originally a cheap phase-locked loop system? Also disappointed there is no contact info on the Crosley website to deal with issues.
4,compact radio with a big sound,"A small radio but with a big sound. Looks and sounds good. I was pleased with the quality of the sound but the antenna isn't good enough to bring in some hard to reach stations, especially NPR."
2,Good while it lasts,"I bought this radio for its retro good looks. This radio works very well while it actually worked. The unit can pull in even some of the weakest radio stations and the speaker can fill a room. However, after 6 months of use, it just stopped working. Until it stopped working, I used it 5-7 hours a day. Not happy at all that it simply quit working. Would I buy this again? No. Its the first simple radio I have ever owned that simply quit working for no reason. Junk."
2,great brand name - but dissappointed on quality of performance,"The radio is a convenient size and great deco look; but the quality of sound, especially on AM is poor with sound distortion and interference. All of my previous crosley products have represented the Crosley name with quality and top performance. This radio falls short and I am surprised the Crosley name is stamped on it."
2,Disappointing. Reads more like a quickly published PhD dissertation.,"I was so excited to purchase this book, but I find it unfortunately obtuse. Buddhist thought is a complex topic, but the authors make it even less penetrable with their rambling writing style. It's too bad their editors did not help them make their language more crisp, and their presentation of ideas more organized and, generally, lucid. Sounds like others out there appreciate the text more than I; I find Rupert Gethins ""The Foundations of Buddhism"" much better in its treatment of every topic that I've looked up.The Foundations of Buddhism (OPUS)"
5,Contains the best brief overview of tantric Buddhism,"I've only read chapter seven of Williams' ""Buddhist Thought,"" which was actually written by Anthony Tribe. However, on the strength of this one chapter alone, I feel moved to recommend this book. Put simply, chapter seven is the single best brief introductory overview of tantric Buddhism that I have ever encountered. I was stunned by the amount of useful, intelligent, accurate information that was provided in such a short space, especially since this is one of the most misunderstood topics in all of Buddhist Studies. Bravo to Tribe; this chapter alone is probably worth the price of the book, and if the rest of the book is up to this standard, this is a volume of rare excellence indeed."
1,Caveat Lector,"The reader should be aware of the fact that the author of this book was in the process of converting from Buddhism to Catholicism when he wrote it. In fact he then went on and wrote a book specifically about THAT - it is titled ""The Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism"". In my opinion Williams goes out of his way (and at times quite obviously) to promote the view that Buddhism is inherently nihilistic. Rupert Gethin's ""The Foundations of Buddhism"" is vastly superior, as are the books by Kogen Mizuno: ""Essentials of Buddhism"" and ""Basic Buddhist Concepts""."
1,Not that great,"This is not a great book - pure and simple. The author is chaotic in his exposition of the subject and time after time tries to come up with his own reinterpretation of the key concepts of Buddhism - apparently, in an attempt to look original. Not recommended."
2,I was very disappointed--,"First I thought it should be called Wide Range because of all Linda's varied interests but as I looked through it, which took all of l0 minutes to review, I was very disappointed in it. The pictures were too simple and looked like a child's first attempt at photography. I am a staunch Linda McCartney fan of her photography and share in her many interests, but felt let down by this book of simplicity."
5,Great Gift,Got these as a gift for my dad. He goes through many pairs of leather slippers so I decided to try these. He loves them. He put them on immediately when he got them. He says they are warm and comfortable.
2,Like walking on a board,"The soles are so very, very thick and ridgid Walking was uncomfortable as the shoe did not flex with my foot. The size was fine but on every step my heel almost came out of the shoe. Looked nice but !!!"
5,Worth the price,"I bought these for my husband. He was irritated when he saw the brand because he knew they cost, but once he put them on and wore them for a bit, he was convinced you get what you pay for. Awesome!!"
5,Finally a gift my husband wont' return.,These slippers were better than expected. Look and feel great. My husband's only request this year was UGG slippers. Looked them up on line and ordered them. When he opened his gift on christmas morning he was very surprised and hasn't taken them off since.
5,A male UGG wearer...and proud.,"These are by far the comfiest shooes I have worn in a really long time. I honestly dont care what the critics say about UGG, these are my favorite shoes in my closet!!!"
5,Great warm slippers.,Always wanted a pair of UGGS and I can see why they are more expensive than other slippers. They are very comfortable and great to walk around the house in.
1,What a disappointment.,"I had read one of his previous books and thought it was okay. I was expecting this to have some entertaining examples of smart people falling for intellectual fads and some insights as to how that happens. Unfortunately, no such luck. All of the examples are ones that are widely known and there is really no insightful analysis. The book is quite short - all of the interesting content would barely fill a New Yorker article - and one gets the impression that this was just put together over a few weekends. I would have to say that the content is uniformly at the junior high school level. Save your money, no entertainment or enlightenment here."
4,Unusual mysteries,"The Dept of dead ends is where clues that don't ""fit"" end up. sometimes, much later, they are used to solve a seemingly completely unrelated crime."
2,"Great buy at a lower price for required reading, but terribly put together book.","This book was purchased to fill my TA320 reading requirement. The book is poorly put together with formatted essays that are hard to follow and often uninteresting. It almost felt like I was reading a book written by a high school graduate with no respect for the movies. Miraculously, my instructor had much more informing handouts available than the drivel in this book. The cover is from House on Haunted Hill, which was more psychological thriller than horror."
5,THIS IS A GREAT CD LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE!,"This cd is so great. I've had it for probably 5 months or more and still love it. All I wanna say is buy this cd before you buy any of their others. If you already have this cd, buy ""Leche Con Carne"". This cd is a rarity in that all the songs are great and don't get old. I have 258 cds and this one is in the top 5% as far as good albums go. After you have this cd, buy all the Lagwagon cds starting with ""Trashed"" because they compare well with NUFAN and are probably a little better aside from the fact that this cd ROCKS!"
4,No use for a title (Didn't see that coming...),"This is a pretty good CD. The first 6 songs are excellent, ""Invincible"" being my favorite No Use song ever written, produced, and published. After that it kind of gets old. ""On the Outside"" is another great track. There is a trend in every single No Use album...Can you guess? They say ""F*ck"" once in every CD, they cover one song on every CD, and they have a girl sing on every CD. Well, maybe they don't cover a song on EVERY CD, but almost. ""Leche Con Carne"" is their best CD by far, but this one still gets a high score. It's not a bad CD."
5,Best NUFAN cd by far,"On the Outside has to be one of my favorite punk songs I've ever heard. There isn't a song on this CD I don't like. Tony Sly's voice is awesome on this CD, this is my favorite punk CD, it's hardcore punk at its *ucking best!"
4,A Cd worth a listen,This has some killa tracks like on the outside and really there is only one or two spots where you'll be reaching for the skip button. This album is better that any of their others
5,This is NUFAN's best album yet.,"Once again NUFAN comes through with a great album. This is by far the best NUFAN album because it is consistantly good. I wish though they would come out with some harder songs like some on ""Incognito"". Otherwise this is one of the best punk albums I own."
3,Alright.,"I would have given this album more stars if it had NOT included the terrible rendition of Fields of Athenry. This song is not a Scottish folk song as some people seem to think but it is an Irish rebel song sung at Celtic football(soccer) matches and NUFAN have totally wrecked this amazing song as you need to have a fantastic atmosphere to get the true meaning of this song.However the rest of the album is quite good. ""Best Regards"" is amazing."
2,"eh, not great","i have a lot(54) of punk cds, and this one doesnt compare to most of my other cds, basically because all of the songs sound so alike. it gets boring, and all of the songs get confused in my head. if you want a no use for a name album, get daily grind or leche con carne. if you want a great punk album with similar lyrical qualities, get strung out, avail, or lagwagon. however, if you want an awesome album cover of a cub scout getting torched, this is for you."
3,The Love of Money,"Raffles Haw is the new guy in town and the whole population is atwitter with gossip. When his home is overtaken by workmen and strange boxes are seen coming and going, it only adds to the intrigue. Robert and Laura are his nearest neighbors and are soon delighted to meet this eccentric new addition to the small English town.When the brother and sister pair find out how filthy rich Haw is they swear to remain untouched by his wealth. That much money, though? What would you do?This is an interesting short read (free on Kindle) about the the love of money and how that love can corrupt a soul. Those words ring true still today (this book would make an awesome reality TV show!). The is a story very much like something Jules Verne would write with some interesting tidbits about inventions and chemistry in the pursuit of gold and power. If you like Doyle and Victorian literature, it's a fun read.Even though you know how it's all going to end. That much money? What would you do?"
4,The Doings of Raffles Haw,"This is an old story that we have all heard many times. Money means a lot; and a whole lot of money can sometime change things not for the better. A stranger shows up in town and is befreinded by Robert,a struggling young painter. Robert has a beautiful sister (of course)who works for the poor house in town, and they have an elderly father who was once a very sucessful businessman. The story evolves when the stranger, Rafffles Haw, slowly reveals that he has more money that his new friends can imagine. There are a lot of human emotions involved in this story, but the root cause of the trouble is avarice and greed. The story was written about 100 years ago, but it could have been 1000 or just yesterday. I enjoyed this work especially how the author developed the main characters,and would expect that you would also."
3,Whatever,I would love to really rate this book but there is no excerp to use for the rating of it. Sorry
3,A Few Good Insights,"George Barna has written some excellent books, but this is not one of his best. It is very much like many books about church growth. If you are not well-read on this subject, you might enjoy this book more than I.Barna's strength is his diagnosis of trouble. His solutions are,in my view, weak. When dealing with church growth in general, one has to ask the question, ""If I have to do such and such and have a church that is such and such, is it worth having this kind of church at all? Is this a Christianity WORTH reproducing?"""
1,Curiosity?,"I wanted to see what this book looks like, simply based on the price which is also why I gave it one star. I may be in the minority with this opinion, yet if this book is ""worth"" the money they want for it I would presume one would want to know what it looks like. I looked it up on Barnes & Noble's web site and it really looks no more spectacular than any other coffee table photography book. I love photography and can appreciate a beautifully laid out book of similar caliber, yet I find it interesting what a used copy goes for on their site? Thanks"
5,the best mat ever!,"i'm a teacher and between teaching and practicing, i'm on my mat several times a day, 7 days a week. i go through mats like kleenex because they just don't hold up for me. i've tried various mats hoping to find the perfect one. i'm eco concious and the biodegradable mats biodegrade as i use them. so how eco-friendly is it to keep buying mats that don't hold up to major wear and tear? i've had many teachers tell me about manduka and i finally decided to try it. i'm hooked! so far, there's no show of use. it's the strongest and sturdiest mat i've ever used and it enhances my practice because i feel the strong support. i've turned 2 other yogis onto the prolite mat. i would have bought the black pro mat, but because i'm at so many different locations, i opted for the lighter weight. but, i'm looking to get a black pro for home, or maybe just another prolite. why not? i give it 2 thumbs up, and if i had more thumbs, i'd give more thumbs up. buy it, you'll love it!"
2,One slick mat.,"I purchased this high-end, environmentally friendly, ""non-slip"" mat because my cheap, 7-year-old mat was wearing down, smelly and beginning to show its age.According to the description, and other reviews, I understood that this mat was ""superior"" but needed a little breaking in time (aka, removal of sticky film on surface). After 2+ weeks, 5 attempts to wash and remove, and multiple attempts to do my yoga on the mat, it is still slippery and unusable...enough to make my supporting leg slip backwards towards a deep lunge during a simple warrior 1 or 2 pose. Each time I've tried to use the mat, I end up grabbing my old mat to finish my session.Since I'm also a yoga teacher, I wanted to have a mat in better condition to use on a daily basis, and have unfortunately not been able to use this mat. I am sorry that I have to return this mat."
4,"Great Mat, Does Slip A Little","Absolutely love my Manduka PROlite mat. Like other hot yoga reviewers, I did experience a lot of slippage the first few times using my mat. I read the manufacturer's suggestions and went through the whole salt scrub, etc. to 'break it in.' Still experienced slippage. I did invest in a small YogaRat hand towel which then eliminated the problem. I've only practiced once (since purchasing some hand towels) WITHOUT a towel to absorb sweat. In spite of the mat being 'broken in,' I still slipped a bit. Overall the weight, cushion and quality of the mat is 5 stars, but I did take one star off for the grip issues. I would recommend this to a friend."
2,Slippery!!!!,"I really dislike this mat. True, it has plenty of cushioning. However, I slip and slide on this mat so much! I don't sweat that much, I have given it a generous break in period, and I have scrubbed it like their customer service representative suggested--still slippery. Not worth the money at all!Go for the Jade or Lululemon mat instead, save yourself the hassle."
1,Slip-slide,Got this as a gift and so far have not been able to use it. Sweating even a little makes the mat so slippery you can't even hold downward facing dog. It would be very dangerous to attempt any advance poses. Like other users have said the smell of the mat is very over powering and distracting while trying to relax but thats the least of your worries. I have never left a review before but I felt since this is so expensive and so dangerous that it was important to inform other yogies.
3,Disappointed for the price,"I bought this brand of mat based on a recommendation from my yoga instructor. My current mat was flaking apart. Although this mat is sturdy and won't fall apart, it's also very slippery. I find myself adjusting constantly in downward dog because my hands slide forward. My hands have never slid forward on any other mat I've owned, regardless of price. Maybe I just picked the wrong type of mat for this brand or maybe it takes a while to break in. For reference, I do Ashtanga and Shivananda yoga which tends to be more intense."
1,not what I thought it would be,"thought it would be a much better mat. too narrow, not sticky, slippery; just mediocre. In fact, I use a cheap, thin sticky mat over it and my practice is better. Also, it's NOT a travel mat. it is heavy and bulky--not a problem for back & forth to attend class, but would never pack this for a trip."
3,Just ok!,Not living up to the hype for me. Find it too sticky but yet I'm still slipping! Hoping it'll improve as I break it in...
2,Thick mat - slips like ice if you sweat,"The mat has good thickness to it, feels well made and good stickiness to the floor. However if you sweat, it is like working out on an ice rink, very slippery."
3,High Expectation,"I finally purchased Manduka because almost all of my Yoga instructors gave some really nice comments on this brand. Then I built up too high expectation. It's a nice mat: I like it has a bit extra weight which makes me feel stable on the floor; it doesn't smell horrible. However, the most I expected from the mat is to be non-slippery. Unfortunate, it is slippery... It's probably much better than a lot of cheap mats, but for this price and for this reputation, it should have performed better."
1,TOO SLIPPERY!,"If you sweat at all, do not buy this mat. I use it for Pilates and it is so slippery I nearly always end up putting a gym mat (yuk) over it. I've scrubbed it, I've brushed it...it is still downright hazardous. I paid $80 for this mat at a rip-off yoga facility and I want to return it!"
1,"Slippery, stinky, heavy","If you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat. Seemed to fill the room with it's funk.Does not grip well. I bought it for grip.Yes, it's stable. Worth it? Not to me.Try the hugger mugger earth elements mat(5mm model). It's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat. Not as stable in place, but seems a better value(reasonable price). And it's biodegradable."
1,Not impressed so far...,Um...can someone tell me if this mat is supposed to be really slippery at first??? I'm hoping it gets better...but I could barely finish my yoga class I was slipping so much. I don't even slip this much on the cheap mats. Is anyone else having this problem?
2,Big mistake....,"So, I've practiced power yoga for the last 5 years and never had an issue with my Jade mat, which desperately needed to be replaced. Because my current yoga studio uses Manduka mats almost exclusively, I decided to get one....BIG mistake. Let me start off by stating that this is definitely a high-quality mat with great cushioning but by no means is it light and after slipping and falling on my face (literally) doing forearm Vashistasana last night as well as not being able to stretch deeply in downdog because my hands kept slipping, I've decided to give this mat away and stick with what I know and love. I really wanted to like this mat but it completely turned on me once I began to perspire; the color is lovely and it's a nice thickness but unless I'm doing a restorative class where there is no chance of sweating, I will never step on one again..."
1,Slip sliding away,"I reviewed this at the Manduka site as wellUpdate 10/07 - Manduka were very quick getting back to me. Recommended a 50/50 water cider vinegar wash daily and leave it in Sunshine. I'll try the first one, sunshine in Ireland could be a problem!10/07I bought an Olive Pro-Lite. Have used it for about 10 hours practise, which has been below par practise as downward dog means keep repositioning , even plank gets gradually worse the slipper it gets.I've done the salt scrub and scrubed with a nail brush as hard as possible.Still the mat is like an ice rink.The variance in the reviews would appear to be for different products! I think Manduka need to look at quality control10 hours to break a product in is a bit excessive but Manduka say it can be 3 months.3 months of slipping in practise would make it a chore.Its a wire brush to the may now to see if I can get some usage out of it before getting a new product"
1,major disappointment,"I bought this mat to replace my old Gaiam natural rubber mat, which was falling apart after 6 years of regualr use. I was super excited to find the Black Cherry color, but when I took it to my first class, I was slipping around like crazy, and I wasn't even sweating. My teacher suggested that it might need to be wiped down with mild soapy water to remove any factory residue, and probably just needed some time to break in. I tried both (including a salt scrub as suggested), and continued to slip and slide all over the mat after two months of 3-4 classes per week. I found it very distracting to my practice. Bottom line, I'm really disappointed that I spent 80 bucks on this mat. The firmness of the material is good, but it really needs some more texture on the top to prevent slippage."
1,Too slippery to be useful,Using this mat is like trying to do yoga on a slip 'n slide. I have to put my old cheap mat from Target over this one to avoid sliding out of even the simplest poses. There's no point buying a product that can't stand on its own (no pun intended). Take your hard-earned $65 and buy a different mat.
3,Great but slides around,I do Bikram 5 days a week so I thought a nice mat was something I should havethe mat is nice it has nice cushion my towel sticks very wellIt is heavy but not to the point where its a hassle to carryMY biggest problem is how it moves around during class it literally shifts the hole class which drives me nuts I like to stay aligned with the mirror and sometimes its moves so much I have to stop and move it back I am practicing on carpet in a standard Bikram room I don't see other people having to adjust their mats. So Im thinking of how I can alter it to make it stop moving. I would not buy this mat again because of this issue
5,Great Mat!!,"I love the mat its sturdy feel so much energy during my practice that I never had on the other mat. Couldn't be happier with my choice. I've just followed the directions for ""breaking in"" the mat: sprinkle coarse sea salt over the mat, scrub it down with a sponge, and spent couple of days air dry in the sunshine. that's it ""Now with a lifetime guarantee"" Love it!!"
2,"Wanted to Love it, but got to face the reality...slippery and stinky","I have been using the Manduka PRO for yrs and wanted the light weight version. I so wanted to love the Pro-lite but 4 months later it still stinks and is super slippery (and I hardly sweat). My hands slip in the very first down dog of my practice. I would not recommend this mat until the manufacturer resolves these issues. I can smell the chemicals even through my yogitoe (and I have washed it several times and left it in my patio for days to air out). I do like the thickness and weight of this mat, but the chemical odor and slippery-ness are deal breakers for me."
1,slippery when wet,was so excited to receive.....very disappointed. once my hands got moist i began to slip and slip. returned for a jade mat.
3,Quality mat but not the best choice for Pilates,"This is by far the nicest mat I've ever owned. The materials feel durable and there is little to no smell. That being said, it's probably better for yoga than Pilates. For those that have tried Pilates, you know that a lot of the workout involves laying on one's back or stomach. This mat, while thicker than traditional mats, is still not enough padding to prevent pressure marks/bruising on my back and pelvic bones, and it's certainly not thick enough to protect my elbow during plank holds. In fact, given the density of this mat, I actually think some of the lesser expensive mats have provided better cushioning. It's also quite slippery once it gets sweaty, but I've been told that diminishes over time as it requires some breaking in. I've only been using it for a few weeks, so it's too soon to tell. At least it doesn't shred like the cheaper mats do."
4,Decent Product,"It would be nicer if the matt was a little wider, however the matt holdsp well to being slip resistant."
5,Sturdy matt,A bit thicker than your standard yoga mat. I got it for my husband to to TRX at home. He loves it.
3,Great quality mat...But still slips when wet,"Overall I would have to say this is the best yoga mat I have ever used. I have used the mat for five weeks ~3-4 days per wk, and followed the directions for ""breaking in"" the mat. It is nice and sticky and provides very good stability and padding when dry.I bought this mat however, because it was supposed to grip even when wet. I practice ashtanga style yoga and sweat a lot. Once the mat gets wet I find it to be just as slippery as any cheapo mat."
2,"This mat causes ""Downward Slipping Dog!""","I've had this mat for 2+ years and agree with the previous reviews. This mat is not sweat-friendly, particularly if you practice vinyasa. And, once sweat absorbs in the mat, the odor starts brewing (even if you do clean with the special yoga mat cleaner, herbal concoctions or whatever else).For profuse sweaters with a regular practice, this mat is not for you. For those who dare take an inversion with the Manduka, be sure to put a towel under your hands and/or wipe off your mat before moving into position.On a positive note, this mat does offer more cushioning for the knees (but is by no means as plush as a Tapas Ultra...not suggesting you buy this either because it falls apart). Oh and the Manduka holds up under toe-digging, which is another plus.Namaste!"
2,Doesn't last a lifetime,"I bought this mat because it was supposed to last a lifetime (or two). This is false. I used the mat for only 6 months 5 times a week to practice ashtanga and the surface started to peel off like the others mat I used before (but this one costs twice as much).The purplelite is much heavier than a regular mat too, so realistically this is not a traveling mat. The ""lite"" in the name is just because it is lighter than the black mat.However I still think this mat is superior to the 20 dollars mats"
5,A wonderful yoga mat,"I couldn't be happier with my Manduka PROlite mat. It offers comfortable and solid support to my Ashtanga practice. As they warn you, I slid a bit on my first few uses (so I suggest sticking to an easier class or working it in at home), but since then I've found it to be a very sticky mat and haven't had any problems. While it is thicker and heavier than a lot of mats out there, I regularly carry it to and from the studio in my yoga bag (and I am very petite). I chose the Pinot color, which is a pretty red that leans more cherry/pink than poppy/orange."
4,Great yoga mat!!,I've had many yoga mats & this one is the best.It's more durable & doesn't smell after much use.The only thing I don't like is that I still slide on it when I'm sweaty.This was a huge reason why I bought this mat because it said slip resistant to sweat.Maybe over time when its worn in things will change.I've only had the mat for a month.I would still highly recommend this mat.
4,I loved my first one..,"But not the color. So I bought one is this beautiful color but the mat isn't quite the same thickness. It's not thick, even though it says it's a 5 mm mat it doesn't feel or look as thick.I feel cheated but what can you do?I gave my other one to my best friend and she loves it!Ya, so that's why it got four stars instead of five.Some how, for some reason, the Patina color is not 5 mm thick...."
4,Great Matt.,It is lite and had good traction. I thought I was getting the heavier and thicker one but so far I am pleased with this Matt. On carpet it ripples a little but is so great to have!
5,love my manduka,The padding of the mat feels great on my knees/hands! Love the color! It is a little heavy but worth it for the comfort! I wouldn't be without my manduka mat!
4,great mat so far,"I love my black mat but got tired of lugging it to class. Now I use the black mat for home practice and the prolite for outside classes. It's a perfect mat for this purpose. It has been a bit slippery when things have become sweaty in a strong, hot vinyassa flow class but I have not found this that bad and I assume as I break the mat in this aspect will improve. I have only used it a few times so far. Also any slipperiness cam be resolved with a yogi toes towel laid down once major sweat commences. I would much rather use this mat with a yogi toes when necessary than use one of those very sticky mats that are also open to housing bacteria. I was also very impressed that the mat arrived within one day of ordering even though I ordered regular shipping."
5,Takes time to break in but it's worth it,"I bought this a month ago after lots of research between this and the jade mat. I ended up going with this and was prepared to wait for it to break in. The first few tries were rough, the mat was really slippery. I washed it with dish soap and sea salt, scrubbed it and hosed it off and left it to dry in the sun. That seemed it help a bit but it still was slippery. I usually bring a little towel to class to wipe my sweat so I used that to wipe my hands on I would just put it under my hands so they wouldn't slip. Today I took a class and it was better. A little slippery but much better then it was. I think it will only get better with time. Maybe I'll give another review in a few weeks! Definitely reccomend though. It's awesome. Really sturdy and comfy."
2,yogayoga,Loved the length and thickness of this mat.Unfortunately carried a very toxic smell through my yoga practice.Tried airing it out for a week - couldn't get rid of the smell.Used some mat spray - still no luck.Got in touch with the company for a return.Hoping it was just a bad lot!
4,Best Mat I have used,"I have used a wide variety of mats. I have shreaded, Nike, Reebok, Jade, Adidas, and unbranded foamy ones.. This is by far the most durable and non-slip of them all. My neighbors cats have occasionally used it to sharpen their claws and it hasn't foamed away. I've used it for 3 years (almost every day), it is still like new. I seriously recommend this mat.The only thing it needs to get 5 stars its to be more friendly with the environment."
2,Too slippery,Too slippery. I don't even sweat and my hands an feet just slip away all the time. Not worth t he money
5,Great Yoga Mat Without the Heaviness,"I have the Black Mat Pro. I do love it. It'll last me a lifetime. I bought this one as a gift for a friend. Now I have to admit I want one as well. It's just lighter and more portable. So I'll leave the Black Mat Pro for home use and take the ProLite on the road. I am a yoga teacher, so these mats won't be parked in a dark corner. But I won't have to keep buying mats like I used to in the past....I have about 6 now and I use them for students.This mat is pricey, but well worth it!"
4,Wonderful!,"I love this mat. I have had it for months and recommend it to everyone in my classes. It is denser than the mats I used to buy. It has a bit of cushion without being ""squishy"". I use it at least 3 times a week and it still looks brand new. I also found that it wasn't as slippery as other mats I have used. It is definitely worth the cost and am considering purchasing another that I can keep out at home while my current mat is traveling between classes."
4,my new mat,"I love the healing color of apricot for a yoga mat. Also I am tall (5'8+""), so I love a nice long mat! This mat has a great grip on the ground and also is not slippery. However I will need to add a sheepskin for more cushioning for certain postures. Although very pricey, this mat is extremely sturdy. I look forward to having this mat for a while."
2,living the life,The plot was good. The acting was OK. Secondary equipment makes it a bad film. Learning experiance was good not to bad.
2,Plot and characterization: thin. Fighting: first rate.,"Pretty good old school ""Kung Fu"" flick. Plot and characterization, of course, thin - so it can drag at times. The characters aren't entirely ""stock"" characters; a nice change. The fighting, though, is first rate with occasional creative surprises."
2,Had high hopes,Wasn't very impressed with fight choreography. Shots to the crotch are always amusing though.
3,Excellent kung fu adventure.,"The eagle claw combined with the invincible amour is definitely unbeatable this one of Jonh Lui better movies and with a cast with the likes of silver fox this is an entertaining martial art conspiracy, lots of action great technique, lets be real chinese movies is not noted for original creative story lines and great realistic acting skills forget that!!!! if you want a good action pack martial arts movie this will definitely satistfy your taste, one of the best eagle claw techniques diplayed on screen a must to any collector laterz folks."
5,"Old ""skool"" Kung Fu","The Kung fu kid is right,,,,there seems to be a mild delay in the fight scenes,,,but WHO CARES. That did not take nothing away from this kick-ass flick,,,I said it before and I'll say it again,,,three words: TOUGH, TOUGH, TOUGH. This flick has to be up there on all of your top 10 best, and don't lie. If this one is not in the collection,,,you're not a true old school nut,,,PERIOD!!! The story nontheless very mundane, but the fight scene is off the hizzel!! If you agree with me on this one,,,I recommend ""Mystery Of Chess Boxing"" The best ever!!"
5,great classic movie,Great movie!!! I dont know what the other people down there are talking about but the dvd i got was good and the action was not slowed down or sped up at all. The only issue was I had to turn up my audio alot to hear the movie normally. Halfway into the movie my ears adjusted and I didnt even notice it. Great leg work by john liu in this movie.
1,Disaster.,"While this product looks really nice, comes with a DVD explaining everything. The bottom line is: It does not work. At least not for more than a couple of hours if you get a GOOD set. One of the lights blew a fuse presumably during my first big shoot and I had to return the whole thing. Bought another set immediately from Ritz Camera online. Amazon promised to cover the shipping. They did not. Upon receipt of the second set, a light blew in the first 5 minutes! Then, Ritz was uncooperative about the return. Obviously, this product is DEFECTIVE!"
1,Cheap!!,"THis is a horrible product!! It was made from very cheap plastic. The tripods were cheap. I also did not see anywhere in the ad that these are CONSTANT lights. I sent mine back, I am going to spend a little more for a better quality product."
2,"Where to go, but not how to get there","My wife and I have been living in China for the past few years and we use this book to pick destinations for vacations and weekend trips, but aside from being a sight-seeing reference this book really doesn't tell you anything about how to get to where you want to go, where to stay or where to eat. Furthermore, we've noticed several mistakes with the sparse maps and diagrams provided in the book - for example, the maps for Nanjing are filled with misspellings and mislabeling, even for big attractions like the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Museum.For the average traveler who only plans to spend a week or two in China, this is a great resource for picking places to see, but when it comes to the actual logistics of getting around and efficiently managing your trip, turn to the more informative Lonely Planet and Rough Guide books instead and leave this one at home."
3,"Slick and beautiful, but not that utilitarian","This book is probably the nicest guide book out there to look at, full of color pictures and interesting diagrams. Gives great context and snapshots of a city or town, breaking out the key places to visit. Where it comes up short is as a tool for traveling. Hotel and restaurant info is way in the back away and cumbersome to look up. Almost no info is provided on how to get around (busses, trains, flights) making it of very limited use while on the road. I now copy a couple pages to take with me and bring a Lonely Planet as a reference guide."
5,Great book!,"We always look twice when we see a DK book for sale, and this book on China does not disappoint. Beautiful pictures - lots of information - we can't wait to go."
5,China,"This is an incredible book...provides much more than just a basic snapshot with the most important information when traveling through China, yet allows one to read about locations as one goes along. The photographs are a wonderful addition to the test. Some lesser known facts about the last emperor Pu Yi were fascinating and the cross references were very helpful.I highly recommend this book to anyone planning to visit China!"
2,Great pictures,"I got my hands of the older edition (was it 2005 one?) and the pictures were fantastic. But as a travel book, that was really the extent of it. It does not help the independent traveler with the nuisances of traveling in China. Plus, this book is A LOT heavier than Lonely Planet (at least the ""Southwest China"" edition.) Do as I did - just rent it from the library."
1,Not Modern China,"China after the Olympics has many architectural sites and new icons....none were in my book because it is a 2005 edition, which I supposed was 2010."
4,Good eyewitness guide,"I am a graduate student in US but came from China. This book has a lot of vivid pictures and illustrations. I bought this book because I want to know what China is from the point of view of the US tourists. Although I had been in China for 27 years before I came to US, I only visited limited places that the book covered. I think this book is very nice and interesting because it contains some personal experiences of the author(s). However, in the first chapter, I still found some misunderstandings or incorrect information about marriage of people from 1949 to 1980's. Anyway, these are not related to eyewitness guide to travel. But as a travel guide, it is great!"
5,Excellent China Travel Resource,"This guide proved to be an excellent resource for our trip to mainland China (Dec, 06). As a first-time traveler, I appreciated the tips on customs, eating, bathroom facilities, tipping, etc. The street guide for Beijing was extremely useful. The history section and timeline were interesting reading on the flight home. Our son, who is living in Yunnan Province, used to guide to plan some future trips of his own."
4,The best we got,"Although China is one of the most popular destination today, amazingly there is very little good reference book about it.This is one of the good one; a continuing great series of DK.However, perhaps because China is so large, each province only have a small coverage about them. Won't satisfy the thirst of a comprehensive information on China."
3,"Useful book, but kind of outdated!","This is a book trying to fit 5,000 years of history. It succeeds in doing that and gives every first timers a lot of details about the places they are visiting. However, the pictures they use cannot compare with other DK series books, they are old (some from the 70s) and therefore not showing the real country as it is now.So get your camera and go to see it yourself."
5,DK Publishing THE BEST TOUR BOOKS!!,"I love DK Publishing for their kids books as well as their travel books. Words can make a place seem great, and when you get there, the reality is VERY disapointing. DK SHOWS you most everything so you KNOW what they are talking about. I buy their books without the slightest hesitation. Buy with 100% confidence any DK Publishing product!"
3,Doesn't work on all vehicles,I used his a few times and it worked on cars but did not work on items with lower tire pressure like ATVs. Just be aware of this when you buy. Light and fairly cheaply made. There are likely better gauges out there for your money.
5,Best Squirrel-proof feeder,"After watching the squirrels ravage our last feeder we bought the Squirrel Buster based on its positive reviews. The squirrels attacked it for a couple of days, but the device effectively shuts off the seed when the squirrels' weight closes the openings. Eventually they gave up and are satisfied with the leftovers on the ground. A great product that performs as advertised."
3,high hopes but disappointed,"This is a really nice quality feeder in so many ways, but I had significant problems. I was excited about the cardinal ring until I discovered that grackles were using it, and a lot of them! So I removed that, and adjusted the weight limit to its most sensitive level to not allow larger birds. Well, they still used it! I couldn't adjust it enough to make it close for a grackle. Unfortunately, I had to return it because I can't afford to feed that many large birds."
5,"At last, a feeder that defeats squirrels!","I've put up with feeders which allow squirrels to feast on birdseed for years. I started off going nuts running outside and chasing the critters away, only to have them return in a few minutes. Finally, I hate to admit, I got out my .22 and temporarily solved the problem. I still have guilty feelings killing creatures only trying to make a living. I've had the Brome Squirrel Buster for only a few days, but it works like a champ. Now I enjoy watching my former enemies jump, scratch, chew, twitch, and leap away defeated. They still come around, take one look at the feeder, and sullenly leave the premises. A great product, which is intelligently designed and very well constructed. Quite expensive, but well worth it. In fact, I just ordered another one."
1,defective and yet not backed,purchased this item and it was defective. merchant refused to replace the defective item.
5,amazing product,"I'm a little old fashioned and I feel that a bird feeder is a bird feeder is a bird feeder. The only difference is the size, until now. I have at least ten squirrels in my yard and what ever they don't eat, they destroy. They even ate the hose on my propane grill and I almost blew myself up trying to light it. At least now they can't eat my bird seed and they can't damage the feeder. It works great shutting down the food portals and it's made tough so they don't bother chewing on it. Now they scurry around on the ground looking for seeds of which there are not many because of the way the portals are shaped, not much is wasted. Since the squirrels are on the ground, I attract more birds too."
3,Not Deer Proof,"While it does have large capacity and good at squirrel determent, I have found this now invites deer to come snack on my seed in ways other feeders did not. I fill up the entire feeder and basically overnight the entire contents are gone thanks to deer. If anyone knows how to deter deer, please let me know."
2,disappointing,This feeder has cut way back on the number of birds at my feed station. The perch-ring appears to be too close to the seed. The cardinals still have to stand side-wise. Cardinals and small birds both seem to prefer the old feeder or the platform feeder.
2,Faster to just put the bird seen on the ground.,"Being the bird lover that I am I bought 2 of these bad boys.Filled them to the brim with songbird seed mix and in less than a day both were empty.Each time the perching little fellas were enjoying one seed, 200 seeds would fall out of the feeder to the ground.The doves and quail enjoy the spillage but 2 pounds of seed a day on my lawn is overkill.Perhaps I should try some larger seed like filberts or pecans still in the shell."
4,Good try say the raccoons,The squirrels are stymied but.not so much the raccoons. I had mine emptied over night. The cardinal ring was tore off and the wire hanger was twisted up the limb. Except for the ring the unit stayed together. So far it's quite entertaining.
5,Takes a LOT of abuse...,"We live in squirrel territory. By which I mean that we have witnessed them carry off mature ears of corn from our garden. In broad daylight. Laughing. The little marauders have even taken the odd small pumpkin (whole). Seriously. I love feeding the local songbirds, but the squirrels have already had their pound(s) of flesh, thank you.In spite of the fact that the squirrels have hung upside down and gnawed away a good 16th of an inch of STEEL from this bird feeder, they have not had the satisfaction of accessing our birdseed.After 4+ years of all season use, this thing is still going strong. It looks like zombies had their way with it, but it functions perfectly. Can't recommend it highly enough for bird-loving, squirrel-challenged households."
5,I WON THE SQUIRREL WARS !!!,"THIS BIRD FEEDER IS WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD, ALTHOUGH A LITTLE PRICEY, IT DELIVERS AS PROMISED !! WHEN YOU COMPARE THE COST OF SEED THATS DUMPED ON THE GROUND AND CHEWING ON REGULAR FEEDERS BY THESE LITTLE DETERMINED WARRIORS !!!I HAVE SPENT MORE IN TRYING DIFFERENT FEEDERS !!! THIS FEEDER IS METAL, AND STANDS THE TEST IN ALL WEATHER TO INCLUDE SNOW !!!! THOSE OF US THAT LOVE FEEDING THE BIRDS, KNOW THE NINJA SQUIRRELS ARE THERE IN ALL WEATHER !!!IT IS WORTH EVERY CENT !!! I DID NOT THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE TO FIND A FEEDER THAT WAS SQUIRREL PROOF, BUT BELIEVE ME THIS IS IT !!!! I DO FEED THE SQUIRRELS TO WITH PEANUTS, SO THEY ARE NOT LEFT OUT, AND IT IS SOME WHAT OF A TRUCE, AS THEY HAVE GIVEN UP WITH THIS BIRD FEEDER!!!!!IT WAS REALLY ENTERTAINING TO WATCH MY FUZZY ACROBATIC WARRIORS JUMP ON THIS FEEDER, AND ASSESS AND WORK IT OVER TO NO AVAIL AND DROP TO THE GROUND !! IF YOU WERE AS FRUSTRATED AS I WAS, DO NOT HESITATE, BUY THIS FEEDER !!!!!!"
5,"love this birdfeeder, and so do the birds","Great birdfeeder! Really is squirrelproof. Don't get me wrong, I love squirrels, but I love birds too and wanted a feeder that provided them food without the squirrels getting it all before they could. I just throw the seeds on the ground for the squirrels, and now I have happy squirrels and birds. Have had this feeder for about 3 years, at least. Still holding up well. Very sturdy. Also got a great price, much cheaper than the specialty bird store."
2,Doesn't attract birds,Disappointed in the feeder because it does not attract birds. I used the same bird seed in my last feeder which was a platform one but that broke after 10 years. It looks great but not getting any birds.
5,excellent,i have had this for a long time and it has hedp up to weather and sqirrels. it is a little heavy when full. so if you have arthritis or other limitations you might not want to fill it full when using it.
5,Great product,"This is the second one I have had. It is truly squarel proof. The first feeder is about 7 years old and the aluminum top (thick) has a hole in it made by a racoon's teeth or claws. This still in use, by the way."
4,squirrel free,I bought a different squirrel proof feeder 3 times and the squirrels still managed to get the birdseed. I decided to make an investment and buy a good bird feeder. I got this one for my husband for Christmas. I have seen this same feeder in a local bird store for $90. The feeder has been up for 3 weeks now and have not seen a squirrel even attempt to get at the birdseed.
5,Not Just A Good Product!,"These feeders are a wonderful addition. Construction is tops. More importantly the customer service from Brome is second to none. I was inquiring about purchasing a replacement Cardinal Perch Ring, (by email). They responded extremely quickly and would not entertain the idea of me buying a replacement. Within four days it was waiting for me in the mailbox! The Cardinals and myself thank you."
5,Excellent Product,"We had gone through no less than 11 other birdfeeders from the ""big box"" stores (some ""allegedly"" squirrel proof), but to no avail until we purchased one of these. Of course the squirrels tried every squirrelish trick up their furry little sleeves to get to the food-but to no avail! This feeder works, and works exceedingly well. The birds can feast away while the squirrels are foiled. This is the second one that I am ordering. Could not be more satisfied."
5,The squirrel gang has met their match,"Personally, I have nothing against squirrels. They are very entertaining creatures. My wife, however, loves birds and enjoys having a feeder close to our kitchen window. After watching the pack of squirrels make our old bird feeders into their own private buffet, we decided to try this product out. I was a little skeptical about paying $65 for a bird feeder. But after owning it for a few months now, I am impressed! It is 100% effective. The squirrel folk can not get to the bird food at all. The only thing they can do is wait for it fall. Ditto for the chipmunk. In regard to larger birds (blackbirds, crow), some medium sized birds can use it but the large birds close off the feeding ports. In summary, the product is very solid and does exactly what it states - keeps squirrels out!"
5,Guaranteed to stop squirrels and pigeons,"This is the second one of these that I bought. I live in the woods, so squirrels are a constant problem at my feeders. I've seen the squirrels hanging on this and trying to figure out how to get in, but they never do. When I lived in the city I also used this feeder to keep the pigeons out. The adjustable weight feature works great.."
5,Great for squirrels & annoying big birds,"This great feeder completely solved the squirrel problem. They were defeated, and now just sit and stare at it in disgust.As an added bonus, the feeder offers the ability to adjust the closing weight to shut out the annoying big birds, like grackles who come to hog the feeder. They were frustrated and gave up after about ten minutes. The smaller birds now can enjoy and feed in peace.When we received the feeder, I saw the option of adding the ""cardinal ring"" that came with it. I thought this was just a naming gimmick since our ""cardinals"" had been ground feeders. However, the cardinals love it and are some of our best customers.The feeder is solidly made and is just like new after a full year of service. I highly recommend as a great value."
5,The best,"I have been feeding birds and fighting squirrels for 50yrs. This feeder works; period. Have used it for six months, and not one squirrel has been able to feed from it. In fact, not one squirrel has even been able to get on it without sliding off for a 15ft drop even with the cardinal perch in place. The squirrels still show up every day to look, but they no longer even try to get on the feeder. Last evening a raccoon knocked the feeder from its hanger and the 15ft drop broke the feed tube. Today,I called the company(Brome Bird Care) and told them that I needed to order a replacement part and gave them the part number. They asked for my address and then told me I should have the part in three days. No other questions, no hassle; just as simple as that."
5,Sure does bust the squirrels,"Try as they might, the squirrels just can't get in this feeder... an added bonus is how funny it is watching the squirrels fall off and get frustrated."
4,Works well,Frustrates the Starlings so that makes me happy. My Flickers are smarter than the feeder but for the most part it's only the little birds who can get to the sunflower chips. Squirrels? - busted!
4,A Quality Product: Squirrel Busters 2 - Squirrels 0,This is our second feeder and so far the squirrels haven't figured out a way to raid either one. They are well made products with quality materials. The high price is the only reason they got four stars instead of five.
5,Brome 1024 Squirrel Buster,Bird feeder works exactly as advertised. Squirrels become so frustrated they don't even bother to try for the bird feed anymore. Our cat thanks you for her many hours of bird watching.
5,AMAZING!,"This is the most amazing bird feeder I have ever had. Not only does it stop squirrels completely, you can adjust it to keep larger feeder-emptying birds off. I have it set so that only birds the size of Chickadees, Juncos, Nuthatches, etc., can feed. They, in turn, spill out seeds for the bigger gang to eat off of the ground ... but MUCH slower. The design and construction are ingenious, but if you want full control of who eats on your feeder, I highly recommend this specific model. I have some of their other feeders, but you can't control bird weight on them, so you can have Grossbeaks, etc., emptying the feeder pretty quickly.Great job Brome ... we love ya!!"
3,Keeps squirrels - and bigger birds - away,"The feeder seems to be quite effective for keeping squirrels from the bird food, but it keeps all but the littlest birds from the food as well."
4,Sqirrel buster is good,I have this bird feeder located right outside the window of my sunroom. The squirrels come around but it seems once they discover it is too hard to get any seed they just ignore it. It is fun to watch them try to get seed out of it and sometimes they are somewhat successful. But not enuf to keep them interested. Good product. Amazon purchased.
5,It works!,"After many feeders and much frustration, this is the one. It works as advertized. It also keeps away the larger birds because of the weight adjustments for the ring. I love it."
5,bird feeder,Well made and works very well. I was able to adjust the spring tension to keep the larger black birds from hogging all the seed and give the little ones a chance. The squirrels have given up even trying.
5,Nothing beats it - including Squirrels!,"I purchased this for my in-laws in March and wanted to wait a while before I wrote a review. Well - WOW! I have a YouTube video of the squirrels trying to get a morsel from this baby and without success. They no longer even attempt their fortunes on this item but instead head straight to - and defeat - the other brand of so-called ""squirrel proof"" feeder a couple of feet away. DO NOT MOUNT THIS FEEDER OR ANY FEEDER WHICH RELIES ON WEIGHT TO ACUATE THE BLOCKING MECHANISM, WHERE THE SQUIRREL CAN DISTRIBUTE OR MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT PLACED ON THE FEEDER - IT'S COMMON SENSE! Place it in the right spot and there is no way gray or red squirrels are getting a morsel. Cardinals, finches, nuthatches - you name it - flock to this feeder. At one time I counted nine yellow finches on the perch ring. Now my father-in-law fills the feeder twice every week not because of squirrels but lots of cute, pretty feathered friends. You WONT regret this buy!"
1,Bad Buy!,"Bad buy.This feeder does not work if set to given instructions. It does not keep out Grackle, black birds, or crows with given instructions.. There is no proper setting. I followed the instructions given by the customer service rep when I called them. The instructions did not work. So I tried something on my own. I raised the adjustment setting half way above the first yellow line and taped three nails to the bottom of the perch. It works some what, it keeps out most of the big birds away? I see black bird, crows and grackle at the feeder every day, the food goes pretty fast. The Grackles are to clever, they get food from the feeder. I bought this feeder to attract cardinals and to keep out The big birds t out. I feel there is no ideal bird feeder."
3,Not 100% squirrel proof,"The feeder is excellent at keeping out the larger gray squirrels, but smaller red squirrels figured out how to beat it. They manage to hang enough of their butts over the edge to open the feeder. The spring is adjusted to that morning doves (larger birds) can use it - if you don't have any of these, you may be able to lower the spring tension to keep the red squirrels from winning."
3,"Great feeder, BUT needs modification","I love this feeder. In fact, I have three. It requires only infrequent cleaning since water can't get into the tube. However, I recently found a goldfinch stuck and hanging upside down from the feeder. Its foot was wedged between the end of the perch and the cardinal ring. I called Brome and was told that they were aware of the problem and they sent me some small rings (with no instructions) to cover the ends of the perches. I wish Brome would modify the feeder before they sell it rather than offer a fix only when confronted with a complaint."
5,squirrel buster plus birdfeeder,Great birdfeeder! We live in an area with lots of bird life (and squirrels). This feeder does exactly what it says. Love to watch the squirrels try to land on it and jump off because they can't get food.
5,Does what it says,"I live in Texas and my tray feeder was getting emptied by 20 or more dove in a single day, plus a ton of spillage, so I needed something to deter the larger birds. This thing works. Finches, mockingbirds, cardinals, and chickadees so far this spring. Dove still feed on the ground underneath the feeder and pick up the scraps that fall to the ground.Can't speak to the ""squirrel-proofness"" because I have mine on a baffled pole, so they can't even get to it to try.Recommend this feeder without hesitation."
5,Squirrels begone,"At last, a bird feeder that works.Grackles and similar sized birds immediately close the feeder hole.We have tried many feeders.All were dominated by larger birds and squirrels leaving very few seeds forsmaller cardinals and other songbirds.We also like the solid construction and attractive styling."
5,Brome 1024 Squirrel buster Bird feeder,"Wow! This is the best birdfeeder ever! Have always had a problem with crazy squirrels eating all of the birdseed, leaving the birds wanting during these cold winter months. Love the cardinal perch. Thanks for a wonderful product! The video is what sold me."
5,Really is squirrel proof!,"We have tried several types of birdfeeders and devices to keep squirrels out of the birdfeeders. I bought this one for my husband's birthday; he's in charge of keeping the feeders filled. We have now had the feeder about one month. First of all, the design of the feeder keeps most squirrels from even reaching the feeding holes. We have enjoyed watching their attempts though. We have seen only a few actually reach the ring, and - sure enough - the doors closed. I can't believe how quickly the squirrels ""learned"" they could no longer get any food from the feeder! Our bird seed is lasting so much longer! Plus, the feeder is larger, so it doesn't need to be filled as often. Great feeder, quality construction, and it works! Can't recommend it enough!"
5,Bird feeder,This is the 4th one of these bird feeders I've purchased from Amazon. They work great! I have one that the squirrels chewed the paint off the lid trying to get to the contents but the feeder held fast.
5,Brome Squirrel Buster #1024,"I live in Northern California and the grey squirrels are very diligent in their pursuit of food. Being the most cunning animal on the planet-besides humans of course, they have easily defeated other less expensive and poorer quality bird feeders. They learned quickly that they cannot win and simply wait on the ground for leftovers:)"
5,Working as Promised,"I admit I was a bit skeptical, but, so far, this feeder has outsmarted my backyard squirrels. Everytime one has attacked it,the squirrel's weight closed the seed doors. He tried to come in over the top but couldn't reach the seed doors. They appear to have admitted defeat and have moved on to raid my neighbor's feeder instead.The feeder is a big hit with the birds - lots of American Goldfinches, House Finches and Cardinals. I set mine up using a deck mounted pole system I found on the Wild Birds Unlimited site. The feeder is solidly built, easy to assemble, and holds a lot of seed. Very much worth the price."
4,Good design,"Easy to open and fill, clean, adjust. Constant queue of birds lined up to get a bite to eat. Have not seen a squirrel yet hope on for a try but the birds live it and it seems like a definite ""keeper""."
5,Squirrel Buster Plus wild Bird Feeder,"We love squirrels, but they had chewed chewed and scraped the fascia board on our house while hopping onto our tube feeder necessitating a call to our carpenter. My sister recommended the Brome feeder as she has one hanging outside her kitchen window, and so we ordered it. To our amazement, it works! Chickadees, sparrows, cardinals, titmice, and finches are able to feed. I might have to change the weight to allow the bluejays to get some seed. I highly recommend this item."
5,The Best Bird Feeder Yet!,"I've had other birdfeeders that ""close"" when a squirrel got on it but the squirrels were smarter than the feeder. This one works beautifully (I bought 2)and I love the cardinal ring. I have more small birds now than ever. It's also very easy to fill, which was another major complaint on the old feeders."
5,Amazing!,"Oh what a joy it is to be feeding birds instead of squirrels! I didn't think it was possible to thwart those little devils, but they analyzed the situation, made a couple of leaps, & surrendered. It has been up for three weeks, & the squirrels now clean up under the feeder.I was afraid the small birds wouldn't like this style with the cardinal ring, but they love it, as do the cardinals.It is well made, easy to fill, & was well packaged.A great product."
2,No such thing as squirrel proof....,"Good feeder until the squirrels figured out how to jump on and swing it, spilling seed to the ground. After one such jump, they managed to get the thing to disconnect from a boat latch I used to suspend it from the tree. Once they had it on the ground, they ate through the flimsy plastic part that makes the whole thing work. 86 bucks down the drain."
3,Hungry squirrels,I bought the Squirrel Buster Plus in May 2010 when I was living in upstate NY. It was great keeping the squirrels from eating all the bird food. The worst that happened is that the squirrels would dislodge the Cardinal perch ring trying to get to the food. I moved to Texas and started using the feeder 6 months ago. Those Texas squirrels have chewed the metal top where the hook comes out of the feeder. I can't believe it! I've put Tobasco sauce and cayanne pepper mixed with water on the hole but it keeps getting bigger. Guess everything is bigger and badder in Texas.
3,"Good for keeping squirrels away, but not raccoon-proof","Just when I thought I was keeping the squirrels at bay with this sturdy bird feeder, along came THREE raccoons and I spotted one hanging off the feeder!!! He managed to break the perch ring in half, but the birds still like to come and enjoy a free meal."
4,"Squirrels-No, Doves-No","So far so good. I've had the feeder out about a month and both the squirrels and doves have stayed on the ground. The real test will come once snow covers spills on the ground and the pests become more aggressive.Cardinals have been hesitant to use the ring, also preferring mostly to stay on the ground but I have seen them on the feeder occasionally.Feeder fills easily and after disassembling cleans up very well.JANUARY 2013 Just bought my second unit. Squirrels at great peril hurl themselves through the air to get onto the feeder. My previously reviewed unit has been eaten through (yes through the steel) and is leaking food. The squirrels destroyed the cardinal ring. EVEN SO this is the best feeder I've found to deter squirrels."
1,Price Went Way up!!!,"I bought this last year on Amazon for $57 and liked it enough to buy another one this year when I was shocked to see the price go up to $85 - 50% increase for the same product!! A bit much for me at this time. Noticed that Peanut version is much more rugged, has more metal and is much cheaper (I was thinking of buying). Time to look for another vendor or just stick to the one birdfeeder I have!!"
1,Blue Jays too smart for this dumb feeder,"This feeder worked fine for about two weeks, until the blue jays realized that they could perch IN THE FOOD HOLES and eat out of adjacent holes, thereby foiling the perch weighting mechanism.Brome had better go back to the drawing board; this feeder just is not clever enough for certain species."
2,ground eaters,"Product is definitely squirrel proof, however we found that there is too much seed that spills. We had many unwanted visitors- would not purchase it again."
3,"busts squirrels, but not grackles","We thought for sure this thing we be the end all be all to our grackle problem. Not so. Even with it set maxed out for only the smallest birds, we watch grackles bounce/jump up and down on that thing, timing it just right, to get food out. Maybe they breed them smarter in the north central US, but it is irritating. Wish we had the good fortune others do.There are no issues with squirrels, however, and for that we are thankful."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"We've had about three bird feeders that were ruined within days because of squirrels. I had given up on bird feeders until one day at my sister-in-laws, we enjoyed watching birds all morning that were feeding from this particular feeder. We decided it would be worth a shot. This seemed like a pretty neat concept that seemed to work.The birds needed about a week to figure out that our house finally had food! We have chickadees and occasionally titmouse birds all over this feeder. I am really enjoying this feeder! I have never been a bird watcher before, but now I am very interested in birds. A cardinal perched on the hook once, but it never fed. Maybe I need to adjust the setting like another reviewer mentioned.I only do reviews for purchases that really thrill me. This one has exceeded my expectations. If you have a problem with squirrels but want to enjoy birds, make the purchase."
5,Squirrel Buster Plus,"A great feeder! The squirrels hate it and the birds love it. Excellent design, quality materials and super features. Finally something that works!"
5,After 1 yr this item is still great,"I bought this squirrel proof bird feeder July 2010. Now after 1 year it has survived very well in my backyard in Atlanta. The adjustable spring does a great job of allowing you to regulate the weight of the birds that feed here. Additionally, it has done a great job of fending off the many gray squirrels in my yard. While the feeder is not design to stop raccoons, it has also survived the numerous attacks by a raccoon living in the area as well. Raccoons are able to climb the shepherds hook and throw the feeder to the ground. Despite the beating, this feeder has turned out to be very durable and very easy to clean as well. Definitely worth the money I paid for a quality feeder. Highly recommended. Birds love it."
5,Big feeder,I don't have a lot of experience with it but so far it looks good. The stupid squirrels haven't found it yet so I don't know how well that part of it will work. One thing to note is that it is BIG. It holds LOTS of bird seed.
2,A seed waster,"A good idea but for every seed a bird takes, 2 or 3 fall to the ground. The bird love the feeder but the squirrels do too. They just shake the seed out or get what falls to the ground from the birds."
3,Squirrels chewed through the lid!,"I've had the bird feeder for several months now. The closing mechanism works as advertised, sliding closed each time a squirrel perches on the ring. Unfortunately, however, the squirrels chewed right through the metal lid. I'll be contacting the manufacturer and hopefully get a refund or a replacement part. If not, I don't know what I'll do. The birdfeeder is useless now, as the birdseed will get wet when it rains."
1,Too bad the squirrels ripped it down!,I could not believe that this new feeder was destroyed completely after a few weeks of hanging. The squirrels managed to pull the hanger off and topple it to the ground. It cracked! This was hung on secure wrought iron that I hang plants from in the summer.Perhaps the company should make the metal connection more solid!So unhappy for the price! I would never purchase from them again.
2,"Squirrels cannot get in, but they can knock it down","THis is a nice feeder. If your squirrels aren't particularly aggressive it might work for you. However, they easily can knock it off the pole/branch and eat the seed off the ground. Another issue I have is with moisture and sometimes FUR (YUCK) getting in the feeder holes, thus defeating the whole purpose. I was too frustrated & had to throw it away. Also, one time the top wasn't secure and the squirrel literally crawled into the tube. I saw him eating and was just amazed at his feat. Hand to God."
3,not squirrel proof,"I have two of these and they are better than others but not ""squirrel proof"" The squirrels have been able to actually gnaw away at the metal around the hole where the hanger comes through the cap on both. I put one under a plastic hood. This just made the squirrels mad. They chewed through the perch assembly rendering it useless. I am replacing this one now. The other one's days are numbered as the squirrels continue to remove the metal on the top and the bottom of the feeder. Heavier,stronger metal is needed to make these feeders truly squirrel proof. They ain't cheap and I think they ought to be of better quality."
3,squirrel proof feeder ????,"I have had this feeder for a couple of years and at first it did the trick. But......squirrels are crafty little critters and they have literally torn it up. These feeders are expensive and don't know if I would repurchase one or not. I have a couple of the Yankee feeders and just looked at another one today and found they have eaten through the steel wire that has one of the perches attached to the feeder. Unbelievable. Anyway, my suggestion is to make sure you put these feeders as far away from the tree as possible and put a baffle on top of it. Make it as hard as possible for them to get on it. I have seen my squirrels jump from quite a distance and hang upside down on mine. Good luck!"
2,Does not attract cardinals,"If you are hoping, as I was, to see more cardinals in your yard using this feeder, you will be disapointed. The cardinals do not prefer this type of feeder at all. I have only seen one or two of them use it in the six months I have had it. I do get lots of cardinals, but they ignore this feeder like the plague. Instead, they prefer to eat off the ground (typical of cardinals) or they use a standard feeder on a stand I have had for years. The cardinal ring portion of this feeder is a joke. If you want a squirell proof feeder , this will work, but don't expect the cardinals to use it, even with the so called ""cardinal ring"". I'm sorry I wasted my money on it, thinking the cardinals would like it. c.u. Michigan"
3,Does NOT work for Cardinals,"This is a great squirrel proof feeder BUT it will not work for Cardinals.I have had this for a year now and the cardinals have a difficult time at best perching on the ""Cardinal ring"" provided."
3,Squirrel proof but not starling or rain proof,"We've had one of these feeders for several years now. We haven't had any problems with squirrels using this feeder. The roof was chewed up at one point but I think that was from rats not squirrels. I mentioned that this had happened when at the store we purchased it from and they gave us a new lid. We haven't had any problems since then.We did have starlings using the feeder so we took off the plastic perching ring. This worked well for starlings but the silver pegs fall out with repeated use by small birds. They twist the perches off as they land and fly away.Living on the West Coast, we have a lot of rain. The rain seeps in through the hole at the top of the lid and the seed get moldy. The feeder is difficult to clean as it is so large and some parts do not come apart.This feeder would probably be great for dealing with the squirrel issue in a drier climate."
2,poor in rain,"I have 3 of these feeders and they do a very good job of defeating the squirrels, raccoon etc. However they are not very good at keeping the seed dry. Rain enters the feeder through the top and it gets in the feeding holes; a couple of days after a rain storm the seed in the feeding ports will be spoiled, and the bird stay away. We put squirrel domes on the top of these feeders - stop rain from getting into the feeder tube. However feeding hole still get wet and the food will spoil - you need to clean out the feeder holes after every rain."
5,Mad squirrels,Does as advertised. Squirrels have attacked this feeder to no avail. Wonderful costumer service. Part of the cardinal ring was lost after an attack but after contacting the company they sent a replacement free of charge. This will pay for itself in seed savings from what the squirrel would have eaten.
5,Truly Squirrel Proof!,"I was beginning to think that there isn't any such thing as squirrel proof, but this feeder truly is. Squirrels were cleaning out my bird feeders in days. I purchased several so called squirrel proof feeders that the little buggers figured out in a matter of hours. The Squirrel Buster busted them! It works so well, I left one of the old squirrel proof feeders up just so they would have a source of food!The Squirrel Buster worked so well that it resulted in territorial fights amongst the squirrels when they realized that they were not going to gain easy access to the sunflower seed I put out. My squirrel population had grown to as many as 12 squirrels feeding from the various feeders at the same time. Now, three or four squirrels show up for the easy pickings feeder I've left up, but the others have moved on to easier targets.Highly recommended!"
4,Works well,"This product is great. It does operate as advertised, no squirrels or large birds can feed. They do try, but finally give up. Some birds have learned to flap their wings to make themselves lighter so they can feed. My only complaint is that a lot of the bird seed falls out . I would recommend."
5,great product!,"This is the Best bird feeder I have ever owned! I find that by hanging it from a swinging bar the squirrels can't get the seed at all. They get onto the feeder and it shuts down. Although it's expensive, it has paid for itself by the seed I have saved."
2,No Cardinals dinning here,I have yet to see a cardinal use this feeder. I got the smaller one which works great for smaller birds I ordered this for the cardinals and they don't use it. I have it hanging with my all my feeders only small birds use it. Works great to keep squirrels away. I feel that the ring is to high for the larger birds to perch on and eat.
5,The Best Squirrel Proof Wild Bird Feeder On The Market Today,"Brome 1024 Squirrel Buster Plus Wild Bird Feeder with Cardinal Perch RingI don't usually take the time to rate the products I buy, but I would say without hesitation that this wild bird feeder is the best on the market today. I have tried the rest, but now I own the best. The construction of this feeder is excellent and I can attest to the fact that Brome Bird Care, Inc. stands behind their product. Their customer service people are courteous and helpful with any questions you may have about the feeder. My feeder hangs under trees and squirrels have always been a challenge for me, but no more. In additon, unlike other feeders I've owned, It's more difficult for birds such as house sparrows to just sweep seed onto the ground attracting the squirrels that go after the sunflower seeds. So, my delight with the feeder is that it works as advertised and the seed, which isn't cheap, lasts much longer."
4,As good as they get!,"I've had this a full year now so I thought it may be about time to write a review... I've been through A LOT of feeders claiming to be squirrel proof (ha!) this is the only one I've ever had that deters them. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because the cardinal ring perch is poorly designed, mine keeps falling off even though I assembled it just as directed. Tired of fishing it out of the yard, I finally left it off... kind of a bummer, because now the cardinals don't come to that feeder very often because the pegs aren't quite long enough for them. But... it definitely stands up to it's squirrel-proof claims. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend. Happy birdwatching!"
4,Brome Squirrel buster bird feeder,"The only negative thing about this feeder is the Cardinal ring that attaches to the feeder, it's made out of plastic and breaks easily."
5,No squirrels,"I recently purchased this feeder after trying many other supposedly 'squirrel proof' feeders that were not. So far this one lives up to its promise! Large capacity bin holds lots of seed. The cardinal ring works and cardinals do come to feed on this feeder. The tension as set by the factory is almost perfect, it closes the ports when squirrels hang on, but will let small birds feed with ease. One blue jay can feed, but two will pull the ports closed, so I don't have jays sitting at the feeder all day keeping other birds away. You could change the tension to make it more sensitive if you don't want jays at all. So far this feeder has performed perfectly and I am considering getting a second!"
5,It really works,"Works as advertised. I have it hanging on a shepherds hook in the front yard. My squirrels are reduced to bottom-feeding underneath while the birds happily feast up above.Solid construction, easy to clean, keeps seed dry. The only downside is the price, but you get what you pay for!"
5,Fabulous fun!,"Recently we purchased this feeder and hung it closer to our porch windows than we had our older feeders. We adjusted it a couple of times, trying to discourage the grackles. This last adjustment did the trick! Even ONE closes the doors. Several small birds can still feed, and a cardinal plus one small bird can enjoy it at the same time. The competitiion between the small birds is so fun to watch. Best feeder we have ever owned."
4,squirrel buster feeder,The feeder is designed to exclude squirrels and bigger birds like blue jays and grackles. I had it set on the lowest setting and so far have not had any squirrels get in it. I still get grackles and blue jays but they aren't wasting seed like they were with my other feeder. Less seed is being thrown on the ground. Great design!
5,Brome Squirrel Buster Plus,"I purchased the Brome Squirrel Buster Plus. I read that squirrels just can't get to the birdseed. I was skeptical, I've heard that before, but I took a chance and bought this feeder on Amazon. I have had it now since January. I have 9 other bird feeders and this Squirrel Buster is fantastic. I have seen squirrels attempt to steal the seed and they were unsuccessful, period. They could not get to the feed. This feeder may be a bit expensive, but it is well worth it as I don't to refill it as often as the other ones. I can fill this up and the seed lasts almost a month before I have to refill it. I am saving a lot of money buy using the Squirrel Buster Plus. I highly recommend it, you won't be sorry.Over time I plan to replace my other feeders with the Squirrel Buster Plus."
5,Busted!,This feeder actually works! I got it more for the magpies than squirrels. The magpies would get onto the feeder and throw the seed on the ground 'till the feeder was empty. The Squirrel Buster solved that problem and has been effective against the squirrels too.
4,best feeder we've had,"This has been the best overall birdfeeder we've had at keeping pests off; we use it for sunflower seeds all year. We recently lost it, however, to a bear. He just emptied it the first time, but now has smashed the tube and broken the spring thingy. Remember to take it in at night if coons and bears are at all a threat in your area."
5,Great squirrel proof bird feeder,"I have tried other feeders and mixing squirrel deterent pepper mix in the seeds but nothing has ever stopped a determined squirrel until I installed this product. It looks good and the birds love it, especially cardinals. I highly recommend it."
5,The Very Best Feeder Ever,"This is truly a great bird feeder, very well made & completely squirrel proof. I just wish I had bought this earlier, is worth every penny. I love it and the cardinals love it too. The customer service is excellent. A must have for all bird lovers."
5,Best bird feeder I ever bought,"The birds love it -- the squirrels can't figure it out. I left the tension adjusted as it was in the box, but kept the book in case I need to adjust later. I've only seen smaller birds feeding so far -- I hope to see cardinals so I know it's not adjusted too tight. It's very sturdy and I think it was money well spent."
3,Squirrel Buster,"The Squirrel Buster certainly does keep the squirrels out, as promised; they've mostly given up trying to get into it. The bad news is that the birds seem reluctant to use it, even after two weeks. I get the occasional bird, but nothing like in the past. These are all birds that winter over, so I can't blame it on migration. It's in exactly the same place as the old feeder. If anyone has any suggestions, I would welcome them."
5,Stylish and functional,"I have this black model 1022 which is a heavier stiffer leather for winter, as well as the Kangaroo leather-model 1018 in hickory crackle for summer (kangaroo hide is lighter and more supple). Those are my two favorite models from Barmah.Highly recommend for style and function."
1,terrible customer service from manufacturer,"it's true this stuff gets the animal smell out, but it leaves behind the odor of the product which is not all that great. I called the number on the bottle and spoke with a staff member- who sounded just like the voice on their voice mail - on several occasions. She promised to have the customer service staff call me back- NEVER HAPPENED. I have sent several emails as directed on their voicemail- NEVER RESPONDED. I was not asking to return the product, just some advise in getting the product smell out of my carpet. I am having to go rent a carpet cleaning machine at this point. Should have done that first and never purchased this product. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCTGet Serious Stain, Odor & Pheromone Extractor - Gallon"
3,STILL TRYING OUT,I'M STILL OUT ON THIS. HAVE PUT IN MY CARPERT CLEANER SHAMPOOER..LIKE TO PUT ON JUST ABOUT MY WHOLE CARPET..WILL LET YOU KNOW
3,Doesn't quite keep its charge,"It functions, but the power level never reaches 100% any more, and will hover around 40% unless I discharge it completely and recharge."
2,"Nice screen, but the sound sucks.","I was looking for a new MP3 player to replace my Sony NWZ-A816 which got stolen at a Filter concert. I saw this selling for $99 at Fred Myer and decided to try it out (I made sure to keep my receipt of course, incase I didn't like it). It looked like a nice player, it had a huge screen and 8gigs of storage. When I got home I uploaded some music to it and tried it out. The sound was so drab and dull compared to the Sony I had. I fiddled with the Customizable EQ to see if that'd help, no go. I heard it had something called ""FullSound"" technology, but I could not locate this function in any of the menus. (I also couldn't find the Radio function either). Even my 80 dollar Senheizer headphones sounded like crap with this thing, I have taken it back and now I am waiting for my local Best Buy to get more of the NWZA-728PNKBB. A big screen means nothing to me if the sound is no good."
3,Not manifold in picture,The product was a manifold for my application. However it was a Cast manifold and not the formed steel as pictured which was half the reason I was willing to spend a little more.
2,Casting Call,"When they made this book into the movie of the same name, I was curious as anything to see who they would pick to play Frank, and who they would pick to play Joe.Imagine my surprise when they selected a youngish Kevin Costner for the part, and then switch the scene drastically to setting this in the U.S. Navy.But it does not end there. Since Kevin then had so much star power, they actually got rid of Joe Hardy altogether and did with Kevin Costner to play just Frank. Was it because Kevin demanded too much money?"
3,Decidedly mixed,"That explains my feelings of reading this book. Everything about this book screamed ""NON-WESTERN!"" The rhymes and puns and capitalized words that ""interrupt"" the narrative, a non-linear plot, and symoblism that symbolizes other symbols(!) For a few paragraphs, this was refreshing. But Roy's narrative technique -- taking a simple story, stuffing it in a cuisinart, and letting the resultant globs of narrative fall where they may -- seems to preclude a critical perspective on Indian history and Western cultural influence. Instead, the reader gets vertigo and is confused as to where to go and what to do -- the exact byproduct of a postmodern, multi-national capitalist world that she supposedly is criticizing."
2,Overrated.,"Wow. I don't feel like reading this book was a complete waste of my time, thus the two stars, but it was pretty darn close. I read the book for my book club and everyone in the group felt the same way. I found it to be extremely wordy...too wordy. It was as if she was just writing to fill pages at times. She overdescribed most everything to the point of obnoxiousness. The story is interesting, and different for sure, but confusing at times as the extreme wordiness takes over. Had she just told the story, I'd probably feel differently. My book club was left wondering, where was her editor?"
1,Completely Boring - Wasted My Time,"I tried to read this book three different times. The furthest page I have reached is 100 and I gave up. I just don't care about these characters and it's hard to keep track of who the characters are. I was constantly trying to figure out who a character was and then all of a sudden a new character comes into the picture and I honestly didn't see what their relevance was.This book is just boring. Yes, there was some good imagery, although I wouldn't call it ""amazing"" like some of the other reviewers do. I'm actually surprised to read that from some readers. I feel like I read a completely different book.Anyway, I feel like I wasted my time with this book. I will not attempt to finish it."
1,Don't even bother with this one,"With all the awards this got, I forced my way to keep reading, hoping it would get better. I got through half of it, bored with the stories and the writing style. I didn't care about any of the characters and could find nothing remotely compelling about the storyline. Seems that a lot of reader comments were similar to this. I wish I would have read them before buying the book."
2,Is it deserve booker prize,The succsess of the book The god of small things was not by the quality of the book by the business tricks of the publisher . It is so rediculas that making derogatory comments about a well known personality.
1,A BOOK RESERVED FOR LITERARY BUFFS,"After reading this book, I know why it clinched the Booker Prize. Like last year's winner, Graham Swift's Last Orders, it is so literary. Nearly every paragraph contains a metaphor or a simile. It is good to have some of these sporadically placed throughout the book, but certainly not with the frequency seen in the book!. This book generated so much hype in the media but is a thorough disappointment for readers like myself. A tedious task to read."
2,Give us a break ..,"The hype surrounding this book abounds with much the same overuse of metaphor as does the writing of the book. Knee deep, no, thigh deep, in metaphor may work for some, but this is a case of the writer sacrifycing story for style. Poetry? No way. A tapestry of overdone style."
3,Not enough respect given to maoris,Except for a fleeting reference to 'Ooshton Hauston Bergasson' the story lacks detail of the Maori migration to Dargaville and Kaitaia. Joe Hawke is referred to in a very disrepectful way as a mongrel - which may or may not be true.
5,Absolutely amazing,Splendid. It's one of the greatest works from Indian-English authors. It's really surprising to note that many people didn't like this book. This may be because of astonishing closeness to reality and heart wrenching sadness of the story. The style of her narration is definitely one of the best i've ever read.
4,The God of Small things is a God of children and all things.,"I was incredibly moved by this novel. Its beauty is the presentation of life and death through the eyes of children. I felt like I was entering their world and seeing it through their eyes. Roy is incredibly sensual like Rushdie and other Indian authors. Not only are colors intricately created and explored. All the senses are involved, especialy touch. I will always remember having the sense of the earth underneath my bare feet from this novel. The most profound issues of racism, the caste system, sexism, and politics are seen through the eyes of children."
2,Okay,"If you have nothing else to read I'd read this. I was often confused by the writing style. This is NOT a beautifully written book, the exotic location and family disfunction it what holds your interest."
1,"Pedestrian, mishmash","A previous reviewer, Lisa Mason, gets to the heart of the book in her review but she wonders at its success and her own failed books. Well, the reason is the locale and marketing. Lisa Mason's books are about now and here in the cyberworld but all that is passe. Technology is here and so it is boring. A successful book will go to the margins and Kerala is as good an example of something unlike the West that one can imagine."
2,"starts slowly, then slows down","This novel, in its use of words, is a real joy. The author plays with words, making up fun combinations, like a real virtuoso. But the book can't seem to make up its mind about being a story or a series of character studies. The result of this combination is that one loses the fictional dream. One has no real plot to carry one forward among the verbal pyrotechnics. When I started reading I felt I could recommend the book, but by the end it was a real chore just to finish. Not recommended."
3,Yikes! Someone get the Alliteration Police!,"Roy presents a wonderful tragedy in her book, The God of the Small Things, but her usage of literary devices uncovers her as a first-time author. Her use of alliteration was obvious and as I read the book, I began to think in capitals. Roy needs to be a little more subtle or her Radical Readers might Desert her."
1,What a weird painful read!,"Boy did I buy the hype written on the back of this book! Call me a sucker! This book is not only weird, but barely interesting. I forced myself to read it so that I could comment on it.. not because I thought it would get better. Do not bother says DomeQueen"
1,a real disgrace,Roy has shamelessly portrayed characters that certainly do not represents the average Indian family. the average Indian woman and that too a mother of two kids does not go around making love with other men nor do the average siblings have love affairs between them. she should be ashamed of how she has presented her culture to the rest of the world.
1,inaccurate,"The book is worth reading,but should not be taken as the truth.Roy manipulates a small part in mahabarata to suit the need for a best seller.The ending of the story is a bit frustrating...but her English and style of writing does keep the reader wondering what might happen next."
1,pretty confusing and average,"The God of small things is really no masterpiece as publishers make it out to be. The story is meant to be the world view of a child. Unfortunately because of poor narration capability of the author the whole story leaves you confused and cold. There is some potential in the tale no doubt, but the treatment is really not too good. Then what happens? To the reader it will just seem like mysterious characters coming in and going out with no flow evr happening. As someone pointed out this seems more like diary writing. At times there are some exotic descriptions. But good god ! This is not enough to make you read the whole thing... My advice is read the reviews, not the book! That way you will be saved of disappointment!"
2,style over substance,"After completing this book on the third attempt I am left with mixed feelings. Here is my honest opinion. This is STYLE over SUBSTANCE at times...; Disjointed passages over story which is in the background if there is one; this is good marketing hype scoring over serious analysis and so on. Yet the book does have some evocative descriptions. SO in the end, not the best you will read, yet not too bad either..."
2,"Everything happens three times, or more","Hard to credit the hype surrounding this book. Endlessly repetitive, rather silly word play, some scenic descriptions, but characters who never rise above banality of thought, word, or action. Like so many novels published today, could be cut by a third or a half. ""Post-colonial"" so important on that account(?), but perhaps when the empire next writes back it can raise the intellectual bar and omit the sentimentality."
3,Too many words!,"I know I'll be unpopular, but I find this novel overrated. In fact, I struggled to keep up with the long-winded descriptions and narratives. Call me boorish, but isn't a novel supposed to make you want to read further. For example, consider this sentence (p19): ""He put it somewhere between indifference and despair. He didn't know that in some places, like the country that Rahel came from, various kinds of despair competed for primacy. And that personal despair could never be desperate enough. That something happened when personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside shrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasable, public turmoil of a nation..."" Sorry, lots of words. Period."
2,grossly overated and boring,"I read this book with a lot of patience and hope! And as an Indian I wanted to believe that I was reading real literature. But frankly at the end of it all, it just seemed a trivial piece of diary writing. Again we should not always look for a linear flow of story in a novel, that is true. But then there should be something to at least sustain a readers interest. Here I could find nothing. The tale is set in kerala; Some, maybe most of the characters are autobiographical that much is obvious. And Arundhati is settling scores with her father and some relatives that too is clear. But a book definitely requires something more. And that is missing. What then explains the success of this novel? Clearly publishing hype, marketing strategies and Arundhati's looks. The real test for Ms Roy willo be her next book. You can write one autobiography and make claims to being a heavyweight writer. But the second one will reveal her true talents."
4,A reading workout with stellar results,"This is one of those books that you really want to put down after the first half--but you keep on going because something within you tells you to read. The God of Small Things is extremely poetic and not for those who want a quick start and finish. Roy forces you to asorb each word and reflect on its validity within the novel. The mundane is beautiful and complex, and the characters are well-defined, and well, somewhat confusing. But, somehow, Roy brings it all together towards the end, and you leave the book feeling refreshed and moved. Admittedly, I almost broke down and cried at the end. Does anyone else think Roy is reminiscent of Toni Morrison?"
5,"Read about the ""non-Western Perspecitve"" - it's about time!","I loved this book! But it is not a book that can be read lightly or quickly. Rather it is one that must be read with time and intelligence. To read it abstent-mindedly means that you read it without gaining from it. It's a great book about a post-colonial country and it offers a perspective that is different than that of the Western one [the perspective that most of us also equate as the ""only"" perspective]. Pick it up and experience what the ""God of Small Things"" has to offer. You won't regret it!"
3,Booker Prize?,"Without rehashing the plot -- I am a bit shocked this book won The Booker Prize. It's a haunting and sad tale told in an almost too cute, sing songy, back and forth in time way from the point of view of child -- but told in third person. It is a clever novel and does explore cultural elements, but never really digs deeply enough in the pathos she explores."
5,Marvelous,"This is the first book I read by Ms.Roy. This Woman is amazing. She has the guts to tell some of the things people don't dare to speak in the Indian society. The book has all the emotions you can name. It is funny and sad.She has a way with language. Her language is simple and eloquent. Hard to believe that this is her first book. The book deals with all the hypocrisies in the Indian society. The thing she had expressed so beautifully is how people decide whom one can love and whom one can not love. I liked the way she describes the caste system. After reading the book, it makes you wonder, if the Indian community will ever emerge from the evilness of the caste system.She has inspired me to do something for the society."
2,A Disappointment,"I've read several wonderful novels about India, including Seth's ""A Suitable Boy"" and E.M. Forster's ""A Passage to India"". This one, sadly, is the worst of the lot. The author shows some promise: she is quite gifted at word play. However, she has not yet learned to to create vivid, three-dimensional characters and her many literary allusions are more than a bit pretentious; what do references to ""The Great Gatsby"" or Vladimir Nabokov have to do with this story or with her theme (if there is one)? Her self-consciously post-modern approach to telling her (trite) story doesn't help matters.To sum up: no characters, thin plot, pretentiousness, and some good word play. This is an author in desperate need of a good editor; with encouragement and a fine critical eye she might one day produce a real novel."
2,Unimpressive recitation of stereotypes,"I am unimpressed by this book and frankly do not understand why it is getting so much publicity. I suppose trite emotional sagas and imitating Rushdie's style has become popular these days. ""The God of Small Things"" attempts to reach the scope of a ""Midnight's Children"" but if you want magico-realism, why not read the originals like Grass and Marquez? As far as her treatment of India goes, I find it patronizing and somewhat loaded with a nagging ignorance of issues (e.g. Marxism, her treatment of the caste system, law enforcement, etc.) I hope her next book is a more mature effort that doesn't resort to emotional gimmickry to get her point across. Her obsessive use of imagery and emotional drama reveals that she has yet to attain the literary sophistication and maturity of a writer."
3,A good read,"Ms. Roy's book truly reflects the Indian state Kerala's culture and habits. Being a Keralite, it reminds me of my childhood and believe me, some her descriptions exactly matches with real Kerala life. Though her language may be rated as Indian English, it gives a live touch to this Kerala story. However she could have avoided some Malayalam (Kerala language) words or could have given translation wherever possible."
3,"Good, not great. Pretty, not beautiful.","While Roy's language was inventive and lovely, it couldn't cover her ingenue storytelling status. Her constant foreshadowing panders to her readers, most of whom don't need to be lead by the hand through a plot. Read this book for the descriptions and Roy's obvious love of language. It made the book worth reading. If only the story made the book worth loving."
2,What's the fuss about?,"I approached this book with high expectations, given all the hoopla surrounding it. What a disappointment. True, the language is in some cases poetic, although the stylistic devices become tedious and irritating rather quickly. The exotic background and detail are interesting. But at bottom, it's just a very ordinary story about nasty people in a nasty society. It left me with a bad taste, and the conviction that if the setting had been America, this book would have fallen into the obscurity it deserves."
2,Has good passages but a mediocre book,"This book is proof that marketing can do wonders to a product. Remember, not long ago Americans were lining up in droves to buy pet rocks! `Small Things' plays to stereotypes about India, about caste, about Syrian Christians."
2,above average,"I have had mixed feelings about this one. In parts I wanted to lose myself; at others I got exasperated. Better editing could have resulted in a better and more fluent story. It is exotic in parts. U can feel a different land and its strange people who are different from us westerners. However like I said, this is definitely not among the best books I have read but still above average."
2,Nothing beyond hype!,"Oh God! This is is supposed to be a great book!Yet why...? That was my reaction to the whole thing when I completed it. Arundhati Roy's much talked abput book is more of a personal narration of her life. If you sympathise with her travails, you may like it. Otherwise it is one continuous drag. The story is about twins, Rahel and Estha and their divorced mother. A lot of venom is poured on the absent and dead father. Again sounding like a bitter memoir of a child. But the story is not linear at all, making it so difficult for a reader to hang on. So many phrases which the author thinks are cute, made me tear my hair in exasperation! Some passages at the begining of each chapter are well written. The first page is quite similar to that of Alan Paton's Cry the beloved country. Yet...In the end ther is some confusion. What did finally happen to Sophie Mol? After a point u simply do not want to bother. So my feelings to sum up--- a pretty average fare...."
2,Jasperreader,"The book was well written but the story, itself, was not enjoyable. Dysfunctional people raising two children who, in turn, are dysfunctional...."
1,positively one of the WORST books I have ever read,"I bought this book on the strength of the review I read in our newspaper - I'll never make THAT mistake again! I absolutely don't get the hype over this novel. I couldn't follow the plot. I couldn't find a SINGLE reason to care about what happened to any of these characters. And I found Roy's ""unusual"" style distracting and affected."
1,Huge Disappointment,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I was disappointed with the rambling, disjointed, impossible to follow story. The poor grammer added to my disappointment. There are so many disjointed phrases, with periods at the end of a jumble of words, it was nearly impossible to understand what the author intended to say. Ms Roy is in great need of an accomplished editor. I read 75 to 100 books per year and this is the worst book I've read in 2001."
2,College Essay,"While some parts were eloquently written, I couldn't help but feel the novice-level in which the story was portrayed. It was very any-climatic and over-hyped in my opinion. However, for those consumers influence by the covers of books, it's a grabber."
3,Gave up...,"I tried to get into the book, but there was not enough to keep it all together. I had to put it down for good after the first 100 pages. I agree wholeheartedly with the comments made by sugunan@piaget.moe.edu.sg from Singapore."
1,"A Corny, confusing,queer book","Well here is my honest opinion about this much touted tale of twins. This is basically a cute sort of kiddish story which sounds profound and arty because it is confusing. It took me quite an effort to complete it. All because half baked characters keep popping in and out of the book. Now what happens to them nobody really knows, and beyond a point u dont even care. Maybe the whole idea was to be arty by being confusing....."
1,"Horrible, a waste of time","This book was full of way too many descriptions and flowery language that I was bored to death and couldn't keep my eyes open. At a total of over 300 pages, it could be decreased to about 50 pages of actual information. I do not recommend this and I have no idea why someone would call this a good book. I am definately questioning the booker prize."
3,The God of Small Things,"While I greatly appreciate Arundhati's skillful rendition of setting and her characterization, I regret having bought or read this book. It matters not how many rave about a so-called ""masterpiece"", or what prizes have been awarded, the inappropriate publicizing of private sexual activity is vulgar and sickening. As much as the intrusion would raise objections in our own lives, so the explicit, painful efforts to make sex public in this novel is a misplaced attempt at being liberated. I am an Advanced Placement Literature teacher. I have been looking for a classic from another culture. It is definitely that, but not recommended as reading for anyone, young or old."
5,I am in the middle of this book for the second time.,"Read this book but read it twice. I finished the book and immediately started it over again. This is a story told on several levels. There are many hints and references to the denouement throughout the book that you miss the first time through. This book is worth the work. I would almost recommend that you read the last third before you read the first two thirds. It is only the second time through that you truly understand the effect of what happens to Velutha on the lives of Estha, Rahel, Ammu, Chacko & Baby Kochama. I don't want to give the story away by revealing what happens to Velutha. This is in the tradition of the Jewel and the Crown. Roy writes like a poet. The descriptions are as vivid as I have ever read. The language is to be savored. Read it and read it again."
4,A delicate gossamer of fragile human experience,"Poetic and simply written, ""The God of Small Things"" skillfully evokes a mood and atmosphere that is often hauntingly beautiful. However, the plot is melodramatically predictable and a bit cliched. One can say the same of the generally one-sided characters. Still, among its florid metaphors (which are, at times, bogus)there lies some deep human truth for which the novel is worth reading."
4,An awe-inspiring book which will leave you in agape!!,"Arundhati Roy explores the rich traditions/values of the Indian heritage through the eyes of Estha and Rahel...brother and sister. The stories take on a few tangents here and there, but overall this book dives into sexual abuse, relational, gender,political, caste and familial issues in India. She has laid everything in color and nothing is in black and white. Whatever Ms. Roy says is sharp and blunt, yet it is truth-seeking which makes this book far more appealing to the reader. The imageries of the stories are far more robust and when reading, the reader gets a picture and a vision of the scene..which is important to understand and comprehend any book such as this! I highly recommend this book...you will probably get finished in two to three days...that's how long it took me!!! =) Happy Reading!!"
1,What a horrid book,"What a horrible little book by a somewhat petty moralist. It was done better in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Which apparently the author read."
3,The Book's Genius and Failure Are Both About Lack of Control,"The genius of this book is how forcefully it conveys that accidental happiness only exists in the shadow of tragedy. Roy's world is dense with potential, happenstance, melancholy, and idealism. All these formless ideas have manifestations no one could anticipate. The world (and the book) are filled with language, feeling and actions without order.The failing of this book is that the story does not have cover its very large bones. The language is textured, but often ""styled"". If a reader expects (given, very conventionally) for Roy to be fully in control of the story, he or she will not be satisfied."
2,Overhyped like an overbudgeted hollywood film,"It was a good book, if you read the last 50 pages, which makes it LIKE a man without a hat. The imagery inudated the reader LIKE ice pellets on the street during a storm. It was rather disjointed and difficult to follow LIKE a winding country road. After awhile, I began skipping any phrase that followed the word ""like"", LIKE a runner rushing towards a finish line. Poetic writing is wonderful, but not everything should be a simile..."
5,I LOVE this book!,"Greetings from beautiful downtown Poughkeepsie!C'mon people, this book ROCKS!Beautiful language, interesting characters, maybe a wee bit too much history, and a terrible tragedy all wrapped in a haunting little message: Things can change in a day.Even the cover of this book is beautiful.The only bad thing here is that Ms Roy says she only had one novel in her. Lets hope she's just kidding."
2,Empty vessels make more noise?,I can't say I didn't like the book. But that's about it - it certainly is overrated.Maybe the main reason I liked the book was because of my age - I happen to be the same age as the author. I could identify well with a lot of things that happen in the book in the late 60s and the reactions of the twins to them - they brought back quite a few memories. Roy has a distinct style which appealed to me. She is good at fictionalizing fact and factualizing fiction. Except for her nobody will ever know what is fact and what is fiction.But all this does not make it a great book. Its too stark and overwhelmingly cynical. Too much time is spent in exploring the past and nothing much happens in the present or even in between. The ambiguous relationship between the twins is never explored to its full potential.This is a case of the hype being an overkill and defeating the very purpose its suppose to achieve!
2,Small Things Were Hard to Find,"I laboured with this book, I really did, which explains my poor rating and why Roy's first novel found itself parked on my coffee table for most of its tenuous existence with me. I am certain a great story exists within the pages given the recognition Roy has received, but after each chapter I kept asking myself: ""Please Roy, just where are you going with this plot?"". This verdict may be unfair and it is a shame because there's some great, imaginative writing here - wonderful visualizations and anecdotes. Unfortunatly, I just kept counting the pages until I was finished."
1,"Clumsy, Pretentious",It reads like a clumsy effort by a talented high-schooler. Vastly overrated and tremendously disappointing.
1,I didn't get it,"I have heard great things about this book and looked forward to reading it. I was in India for six months when I read this book and could see some of what she was talking about and I found that interesting. However, that is all I could find interesting about this book.I think she is a good writer, but only on a page to page basis, anything of more duration than that and I just didn't get it. I read sixty books a year and this is the only book in the last few years that I didn't finish. I gave up about thirty pages from the end. The story went nowhere (at least nowhere of interest), the characters were pointless, and I just couldn't force myself to read one more page when I quit.Everyone else thought I had talked to suggested this book and thought it was the duck's nuts. I just couldn't feel this way."
4,Delicious writing,"I really enjoyed the writing and the way that the narrative is carried out. I got a little bit tired with the plot and the characters in the last part, but even so I'm glad that I read this book."
1,The God of Small This,"Hello Customer Service,I am sorry to say this but I have the wrong product. I wanted the book not the tape. I haven't opend the package till now. Just now, when I got the time to read book, I found out it is a tape. Could you please send me the book and I will return the tape. Or tell me what is the procedure is. Thank."
2,Not very entertaining,I disliked this book very much. From the beginning it never caught my interest. I love to read and I usually can't put a book down b/c I need to know what happens next. This book however I would need to take breaks from it because it was soo slow. If I shut that book at any point I never felt the need to finish it. I don't recommend it. It is very boring and drawn out.
2,Poetic but sometimes pointless,"I don't usually read books which won the Booker Prize, but this came highly recommended by a friend. Well, I did read it to the end. You do, with this one, as the characters catch hold of you and you want to know what happens to them. Still, at the close of the book, you wonder if there were any point to the story. This book reminds me of movies such as ""House of Flying Daggers"" by Zhang Yimou - absolutely beautiful cinematography but you find yourself wondering ""What's the plot? WHERE'S the plot?""Her language is poetic, and I especially appreciate the feeling of ""coldness"" she described. Still, not magical enough to warrant revisiting."
3,over-written and over-rated,"The latent talent is there, but this author needs to refine her overblown, self-indulgent, and often self-consciously showy prose. If she can learn to tone it down, she may be on to something . . ."
2,Guh.,"The literary equivalent of being soundly thrashed with an olive branch after Sunday services and told to shut up and study your Catechism for the next three hours. I found it impossible to empathise with any of the characters, and all it comes off as is some kind of a ham-fisted, hare-brained attempt at...what? Nobody seems to know, and nothing is resolved. An agonizing, pretentious mess. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss."
5,beautifully written,"What strikes one immediately about this book is the elegance and beauty of the metaphor-ridden prose. The author has obvious talent and sensitivity, both qualities of which are made obvious in her incisive insights into human minds and interpersonal relationships that transgress society's bounds. Her skill with the English language is quite manifest, and the quality of her writing exudes great personal warmth and emotion. I thoroughly enjoyed reading her restrained yet meaningful prose, which expresses much with surprising economy. her use of powerful imagery is quite memorable and her invectives against society are brilliantly blended with ironic humour and elegant poise. Apart from some faults here and there this novel is, I believe, quite unimpeachable. For a first novel it is quite an amazing feat, and if Ms. Roy continues as she should, her work will only improve with time and experience."
5,Excellent Book,"Beautiful and creative story telling. Sophisticated style which slowly but vividly depicts the essence of the Indian culture, in all its complexities, through the eyes of two kids."
2,Only for People with Literary Concerns!,good language and all...but if you are looking for a gripping novel this is not it...its focus is mostly on description..frankly I didnt find it so compelling and I don't think i would read it again!
3,A small thing for me,"Somehow I had this idea I would love The God Of Small Things, but maybe I should have realised that a critically praised award-winner will probably be just like this: quite clever, a little pretentious, ultimately somewhat boring. Unfortunately, I had no chance to read the book in English, and I don't know how much the Finnish translation is missing in the poetry. Roy's talent with words shows, but as a storyteller, she seems to be a bit too confused. She deliberately gives away much of the plot quite early, and when she still tries to keep it exciting to the end, the reader has to wonder how many thoughts has she actually paid to the plotline. Not bad, not so excellent."
3,Hauntingly sad,"Beautifully written and hauntingly sad, this novel is a fascinating read. The vivid descriptions are delightful. The story is admittedly disturbing, but not bitter or spiteful."
5,Simply impressive,"This book is amazing. It simply took my breath away. The plot is simple, but the story-telling skill is wonderful. The words and the description somehow have the compelling power to make me feel nostalgic and bittersweet."
4,lessons in poetic writing,"This book is an endless poem of the little things in life as we experience them in the grand scheme of things. I found myself re-reading certain lines because I was amazed at how well Roy poeticized simple things. By this I mean the sound of a trunk closing, the actual physical feeling of a heart ache. At times, I did get a bit lost and confused due to the names and the unfamiliarity of Indian culture. The disturbing behavior of the characters in the book did not surprise me, instead it just reminded me how cruel and strange people can be. It's a different sort of read and I recommend trying it out."
2,A bit boring and too descriptive,"I didn't like this book. The characters are all disturbed and depressing. I hated the way the author used sexual references even when discribing things like flowers and places. I first wanted to read this book because the twins 'Estha and Rahel' interested me. But I soon found that the book dealt with too many other characters and times in peoples lives, which made this book difficult to read and frustrating for me, as I like to understand what I'm reading. There were many references in the book that meant absolutley nothing to me, which added to the confusing nature of this novel. I am probably younger than most other readers of this novel, so I would only reccomend it to an older audience."
1,Lost in Translation,"I had high hopes for this book when I picked it up. Halfway through this book and I find that I have to force myself to turn the next page. If you love reading interesting and in depth books that you can understand, this is not the book for you. The author's words are a spiral of mumbo jumbo that drags on and on. I often found myself re-reading the same sentence 3 or 4 times in order to grasp the meaning but it never comes. If I had to compare this book to something, I would compare it to a long a strange dream... it doesn't make sense and it's not something you would remember after 5 minutes!"
3,"Enjoyable, But Flawed","The God of Small Things could have been a truly great novel, but, like an artist who can't leave a masterpiece alone, Arundhati Roy simply didn't know when to stop. The characters are vividly drawn, and the language is beautiful. Roy displays a penchant for descriptive language that is wonderfully arresting, but becomes repetitve and annoying. The reader gets the picture well before the novel ends, making the last several chapters anticlimactic. Still, I enjoyed the story of a truly dysfunctional family that suffered the after-effects of British Colonialism and an intractable caste system."
3,dull and forced beginning...who cares about the rest?,"I just could not sustain a reading beyond the first 15 pages, although I had nothing else to do for the next hour in the train. Far too many capitals, a forced style, and all the appearances of a cheap imitation of Rushdie. Other readers at Amazon suggest that the book gets better... I might try again, it is supposed to be a good book after all..."
5,How not to learn to write a book,"Roy spent five years writing The god of Small Things. She said that she never rewrote a word, that once she breathed a word, the breath was finished. This attitude most certainly explains my reaction to the book: If you throw out the first 200 pages of the book, you have a good book; if you throw out the first 250 pages, you have an excellent book."
4,A novelty of a novel,"So much has been written about THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS - it is brilliant, it is overhyped - and both are true. The story is my problem: it is a bit flimsy, nothing to really stick in one's mind long after reading. And there really seems to be no lingering message or moral from it either. But what saves the book from being absolutely forgettable is Roy's fantastic - although initially jarring - use of words and imagery. Roy's language and imagery, the imagery that often sticks in the more primitive, instinct-based crevices of one's mind, makes THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS stand out from many other books. If the plot (which is, in a way, saved by its elliptical telling) could be as powerful as Arundhati Roy's writing style, THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS would be an instant classic. Nevertheless, the beauty of Roy's writing makes the book worth the reading."
1,Much publicised but terribly disappointing.,"With much expectations, I started reading this book. To be honest - I found this book is about spit, vomit, carcass and the like. The style of English adopted is extremely irritating. This book leaves no pleasant feelings."
2,A choppy mosaic with no heart,"The book reads like an eccentric MTV video withdisparate stream-of-consciousness clips shot at wierd angles and color combinations tailored together incoherently. Many saw ""brilliance"" in this mosaic. I was turned off by the flash and chaos in this book, for I prefer authors who linger on their characters, loving them, nurturing them and helping me get to know them.But, hey, how can you argue with a million bucks in rem.?"
3,"OK book, heavily overhyped",I had heard so much about this book that I endedbeing disappointed when I did get to read it.The descriptions that ring so true are reallythose of a small self centered layer of society.And as for magical use of language I much preferRushdie.
3,Decent novel by a competent writer,"I'm afraid there was too much hype accompanying this book. Itis a simple tale with interesting turns of phrase, but no artisticvision. For a really good read try Rushdie or Rohinton Mistry -- they are the genuine articles. I would also recommend an even better read in the form of Thomas Wolfe's ""Looke Homeward, Angel"" which gives us a clearer idea what artistic genius is all about."
4,a lucky writer!!! not a gifted one..,i read this book like i am studying for some exam..it was hard to understand the real meaning if u do a light reading..i think this book is a best thing for literature students .. i like the way she describes things to its minutest details..like about the yellow coloured chips..abt the way..she repeats her words.. the story is not very new or different .. but the way she narrates through the eyes of the kids.. is truly amazing. i donot think she deserves the booker prize.. but she is lucky enough she got away with it..
3,Rich in language...poor in plot....disjointed.,"Roy's use of language impressive, but obscure at times....Put it down to translation? Or the dichotomy of the English language spoken by an Indian."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This book was absolutely magnificent! Beautifully written, and provoked emotion. However, it's sad that the one book about KERALA that receives international acclaim seems to focus on the bad parts of culture, which exist in a lot of societies anyways. I just hope people don't read this book and think all Keralites are incestuous or something..."
5,exhilarating!,i HAD to read this book more than once. i turned to the first page right after i read the last one.
2,Very Ordinary Award Winner,"I am currently reading TGOST and I can' help but wonder why this book won the Pulitzer Prize. It is a fine book but hardly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize. She comes up with some nice metaphors but they are often out of context - somehow they seemed forced. Read any of Cormac McCarthy's novels to experience subtle metaphors that stun you with their beauty and accuracey. And please don't compare her (not yet anyway) with Salmon Rushdie. They are both Indian. They both write. The similarities end there. Had this book not won the Pulitzer, I would be enjoying it more."
4,Must read...,"Though I had to read this book for a class I was taking, I would read this book again and again for myself. Arundhati Roy tells a story about real life that is unlike any other I've read."
5,Mesmerizing and poetic,"If you expect a candy coated fantasy story where everything comes out allright in the end - then run away. If you expect a book which will put everything into plain English and use correct grammar - then run away. If you expect a story that is morally and religiously proper, again, I plead you to run away.However, if you are inclined to read books which portray the reality and darker side of every society, then read this. I grew up in this land where Ms. Roy's book is set. What she speaks of is the truth, which apparently, many reviewers can't handle. Her style of writing is beautiful, unique, fragmented, and awesome. Time jumps back and forth, but any reader who's paying attention can easily keep track.I enjoyed this book partucularly due to Roy's inventive and creative style of writing and her sense of irony. At times the writing is so stunning, it'll make you wonder how a person learns to be so fluid and imaginative."
2,Lost interest early,"This looks like a book that English teachers would inflict on students because of its ""brilliant use of language."" And while I have to agree that there are some amazing phrases, the bulk of it is filled with overblown prose that adds nothing to the storyline - if you can find the storyline, that is. I got tired of looking, so quit before I got halfway through it. The author wanders down rabbit trails that have nothing to do with the story, and the characters are never developed enough to evoke any concern about what happens to them. I wanted to like this book, I just couldn't."
4,Beautifully written,"It's been a while since I read a book with this much subtle and effective wordplay. Richly written, Roy indulges in words and uses contrast in language to great effect. Thisaalong with the storyline structure (though at times confusing, it all comes together beautifully at the end) makes for a hyper-realistic, nuanced novel that is 'about' the medium of the written word just as much it is a story about the downfall of the family. As a character study, the book does not fail, though I found having to read between the lines a little bit more difficult toward the end of the novel, when the twins are grown. Overall, a book that requires thought, interest, and an appreciation of a story that takes time to develop."
2,Where is the damn story?,Roy labours hard to describe events/things...flaunts her mastery of the language profusely...but excuse me where is the damn plot? This is story-telling at its worst and ornate writing at its best...for me R K Narayan is still the best Indian English writer...
2,Disjointed - and ultimately disappointing,"You may be curious to read this award winner which has sold so well. But it is mostly all hype, and ultimately it is a difficult to read, disjointed novel. For anyone who is interested in India, Rohinton Mistry's ""A Fine Balance"" is a far superior novel, also an award winner, but delightfully readable."
4,A well written book,Arundhati roy has written an excellent book. The story is setin Kerala. All the characters are well defined and are brought tolife. The language is simple and the reader is taken on a emotional roller coaster. The book is a good read.
2,"impressive prose, but no connection","The writer is talented, certainly, and her prose is amazing. She is perceptive, and has wonderful descriptive passages and insights. However, there was something missing -- something big and necessary. I could not bring myself to really care and be in any way emotionally invested in any of the characters. There was so much darkness, sadness, tragedy, and just plain ugliness in the novel, with not enough beauty and redemption to make it worth struggling through all the darkness. If you're going to drag me through all this nastiness, loss, and depravity, you've got to give me something more to hold onto than these characters."
1,Good for a first effort,Uses all the stereotypes about India to make a story that will gratify Westerners!
2,The God of Small Things,"The author had a knack for vividly describing scenes throughout the book. Unfortunately she relied too often on using mention of gross images to paint her pictures. Also, the storyline seemed to ramble on without any purpose."
3,Beautiful descriptions & characters,"I loved the descriptions used by the author, so original, unusual and easy to visualize. I found myself laughing out loud often. It was easy to relate to the family and their predicaments and the innocence of the children. The method of moving back and forth from the present to the past was a bit confusing, I was a bit put off by this, however, it didn't take long to get caught up in each new story. I look forward to reading more of Roys work in the future."
4,Believe the hype,I was mesmerised by this book. Read it slowly to savour the writing's layers and detail and constant surprises and repetition. I felt utterly for the twins and for the tragic small lives of those around them. I loved the evocation of childhood and its own special sense of place.I felt deadened by the end which I felt was not a real conclusion. A strange sense of fate or destiny hangs over the novel like a river mist which you can't escape from. Powerful Stuff.
4,Poetic description from the heart of a child,The heat of India is palpable and like the sluggish but powerful river that runs through the narrative the emotional life of the twins is sometimes calm and sweet and at other times a typhoon of fear and longing. The reader gains insight into the castes and culture of India while experiencing the universal emotions of childhood.
3,Nice Try.,"The author tries too hard to be innovative - Artificial piece of fiction - Nothing new - Boring - At times I thought ""things can only get better"" but they did not - Still not bad for a first novel."
5,"Poignant, gripping, touching, moving. Enthralling.","I did buy this book with high expectations. Unlike other times, this book went way beyond my expectations. It is sheer poetry camaflouaged as fictional prose. Sure the crux of the story itself, may not be much. The rich visual tapestry she has worn around rural Kerala and India, her endearing story-telling, her very real, and very lovable characters, are what the book is about. The simplicity and ordinariness of the story, only augments and adds to the lyricism of her writing.Arundhati Roy deserves all the attention and applause she has got, and more. I wonder though if some of the subtlety might be lost on the non-Indian readers. Despite that, I still highly recommend this rare, refreshing book, that is as subtle and welcoming as a drink of tender coconut water on a scorching hot day."
1,"Trite, naive, and oh-so-sweet","This book should have been called ""The God of Overwritten, Underanalyzed Things"". The writing is so poor I actually put the book down and started to laugh several times (at passages that were NOT supposed to be funny). The Indian style of word play and the special mode of dialogue wielded so masterfully by truly talented writers like Rushdie, in Roy's unskilled hands simply comes off as cloying and immature. I felt, throughout, that I'd mistakenly picked up a Young Adult novel."
1,"Depressing, disturbing","Slow and depressing, I kept turning the pages expecting more. And it kept being slow and depressing. And then disturbing. Such a highly reviewed book, I have to say is on my top 10 of books I hate and will never reccommend."
2,Why was this book awarded?,"It sort of started OK and then I was skip reading just to find out what happens with the twins. If I wasn't so interested in the ''incest'' factor I would have left it all together. The book goes back and forth - present to past and back so many times - and that gets really annoying and you sort of figure everything out even before it's been said.The writing is a little annoying too - I can sort of see why it may be considered ''artistic'' but the whole thing kinda left me feeling that the award was given to the writer because she is an Indian writing about an Indian family, so it seems ''authentic''. Not fair! This book certainly doesn't deserve it.It was - mildly put - boring!And yes - what was the point of this story?"
2,"Booker Prize or not, it ain't enough to keep me reading","I'm a very big fan of Rohinton Mistry and was hoping this effort by another Indian writer living in Canada might be similar in quality. It isn't. After just 20 pages, I was struggling to figure out what the plot might be, who was related to whom, and mainly, why I should care about any of the characters. After 40 pages .... I gave up. The writing isn't good enough to carry the book. The style jumps from literary to casual modern to just plain unpolished and rhythm-free. The characters are uncompelling. There isn't much of a story. Roy has a long way to go to match Mistry. I can't understand how this won the Booker Prize."
1,So What?,"Yes, its silly pseudo-poetic surface makes it uninteresting and unreadable (I lasted about five pages before tossing it) but the book shouldn't be avoided solely because of the author's vehement criticism of American foreign policy that she expressed elsewhere. Why not just have a good old-fashioned book burning in this once Land of the Free."
1,Not Amazing,"Readers were enthralled by this Kindergarten book, just because it won the Booker Prize, run by SHOPKEEPERS. The language used is absolutely childish and maybe readers understand abused usage of English lingo. I would say, and I know that Booker Prize is very controversial. There is one South African Writer who keeps getting this politicized so called prize. Anyway she failed as a screenwriter and learned the ropes of getting a Booker and in the process made her a millionare. I'm sorry even Kindergarten kids laugh at the sentence structure, syntax, world play---which one reviewer calls ""Jazzy"".It sure is Jazzy as no good writer can write so badly."
2,"It had potential, but failed to deliver","I thougnt that there were many good ideas and themes emerging from the story, but that none were developed. I finished the book wondering if I was missing the next few hundred pages. I don't recommend this book at all. Not only is the story unsatisfiying, but the writing style is extremely annoying as well."
5,Heart-breakingly exhilarating...,"Enough has already been said about this book. Needless to say, it transcends any preconceived notions or expectations a reader might entertain regarding novels in general. The incestuous scene toward the end is a master-stroke. No other plot option could have reported the anguish and dysfunctionality of the twins more efficiently. I just hope Roy doesn't write another novel though; she has obviously wrung her own self into this book, and anything following this will probably be painfully forced and stink of greed for more commercial success (which May, or May Not revisit her)."
3,See how many metaphors I can create... should be the title.,"I bought this book after alot of hesitation...but finding no better book for the trip, i took the plunge. Starting reading the book was enjoyable..but after reading so many metaphors and similes u just get bored and by the middle of the book u just want it to end..and what an ending...it's ending beats or at leasts tries to most cheap novels out there.. it mistakens pure lust with love..and makes u loose alot of the sympathy u feel for the characters..i gave this book such i high mark compared to my review because i enjoyed the first part of it and it was different from most books i read.. but how it won the booker prize is something out of my comprehension...maybe the ending explains it ;-)"
2,"All glitter, little gold.","Roy can write. She can make up new words. She can construct interesting metaphors and new turns of phrase. However, instead of using her skilfull language in the service of ideas and narrative, the novel seems to be largely a device by which the author self-consciously demonstrates her genius to the gallery. I get the feeling that the primary response is expected to be that the reader is to fall at the feet of a new literary titan and worship.As for the substance of the novel: it seems less of a novel than a short story bulked up on the steroid of flashiness."
3,Rich imagery but a lack of emotion,"The twins, at the epicenter of this piece, were lacking so much emotion and character that the surrounding mother, grandmother, and great aunt seemed to bleed into them. I did not empathize with them, but I felt pure pain for the mother who had no chance to explore her mind or love in a caste-ridden, chauvanistic society. The christianity of the family gave the book a distinctly western flavor which I found incongruous with the rich imagery associated with the river, the land, and the pickle factory. Overall, I was intrigued but not drawn in, a fine beginning author's attempt."
2,Absolutely Heart Wrenching,"This book started out great and I was totally mesmerized, but by the end I was so disgusted and heartsick Iam surprised Oprah hasn't picked this book for one of her selections. (Most of her books deal with totally dysfunctional people and families) I was so so sad for these children in this book and the way they were treated by those who were supposed to love them. These people were so screwed up!!!!! And the thing that disgusted me the most was the author having the siblings have a sexual relationship in the end of the book. WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT??????? What did that add to this already totally depressing story. I felt horrible when I finished this book. Yuck!!!! I never want to go to India."
2,"Hard, clever, but ultimately stilted and tedious.","The plot, echoing Akira Kurosawa's classic movie Rashomon in its revealing layer by layer the plot is very cleverly done, but, since this provides the main bulk of the novel, it lacks any real plot. This means it becomes thumb-twiddlingly tedious at times. The characters remain permanently unlikable, and the deaths become a welcome relief from the tedium. The Indian-English is somewhat stilted, and the short sentences can become confusing and excessively complex (at least when you begin), but, while clearly very rich and lyrical, it eventually decends into soapy trash. Good try, but no cigar."
2,"Good literary writing, weak development",The book was written very well. The storyline was a lttile weak. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters. There were none that I hated or loved. I felt the writer could have said the same thing in a less pages.
1,Review: THe God of Small Things,"(I am a University graduate, and I want kids under 13 or any age for that matter, to read this review) THis book is honestly the worst experience I have encountered in my 26 years of reading. With a major in English and literature, this book is by far the most tedious novel ever written. It describes trivial, insignificant things such as dirt on the ground and organisms under the ground that beats your slight interest for this book to death. The title ""The God of Small Things"" indeed does speak for itself. With descriptions to a microscoptic level, this book is both extremely mind-numbing and montonous. I would like readers of this review to read the book and find my points substantial."
5,One of my favorites,"This book was a joy to read - the author writes it in a very unique style that captures the associative ways that children think. She provides just enough information about the storyline at every stage in the book to keep the reader from frustration over the suspense, without sacrificing the reader's desire to continue reading in order to find out what really happened. I am eagerly awaiting the possibility of a second novel."
4,THE GOD OF small THINGS,"My book club chose this book as selection of the book and the reviews were generally favorable. Most of the members, including myself, were drawn to the tragic richness of the character devlopment and the wonderul use of language. Although the abscence of a traditional plot line did throw me at first, the brilliant energy and stamina involved in the writing more than compensated. Sort reminded me of Faulkner teaming up with Dr. Seus."
2,A good story awkwardly written,It was very difficult to keep track of the characters and their relationships. If it weren't I had to finish it for a book club discussion I would have stopped reading it. Even though the story is compelling I found the writing style annoyingly and unnecessarily confusing.
4,A truly moving book,"I have seen several erudite reviews of Roy's book. My own response to the book is not intellectual but emotional. After years, I have read a book which has moved me to tears and haunted me for days after the reading. The powerful and evocative imagery, the poignancy of the story, the depressingly real characterisation, the fluid shifts across time periods ... I guess these are some of the specifics which make Roy's book so distinctive. But dissecting the parts is doing injustice to the whole. In the ultimate analysis, this is a book which will evoke a ""gut-reaction"" from most readers and impact in some way their perception of life. And that is the real test of a good book."
5,One of the best books I have read in many years !,"With this book you do not only learn about India but you also learn about values, education and love. The prose is beautiful, the language even more so, I just wish that she does not stop writting and we see more of her work."
2,a cure for chronic insomniacs,"This book was written keeping a western audience in mind. An audience that would buy anything Indian and exotic.'The God of Small Things' is both with a dose of pseudo madness. This book is quite pretensious. It is more a statement than a serious book. Roy's 'style' is overdone and she's out to prove something and leave an impression, that's why the style takes over and there is nothing in the plot or characterisation to sustain one's interest. I had a hard time reading the book and I want my money back!"
4,"Interesting, Most of the Time","This is an outstanding maiden effort. I found the book a compelling and interesting read. The author does a good job characterising the people in the story, especially the twins Estha and Rahel. As a result, readers are actually able to really empathise for them. The author also does great in playing around with various words and expressions, and in slowly unfolding the mystery. Because the story moves from past to present, I got confused at some parts, but this adds to the suspense that is felt and maintained, especially towards the second half. All in all, this book does deserve the Booker Prize."
2,Waffling into tedium,"I'm beginning to the think the Booker Prize is the best reason NOT to buy a book. The God of Small Things didn't do it for me at all. I found it dull and affected. As another reviewer remarked, the similes are endless and, although they might sound good, for the most part are simply off target. Overrated tedium is perhaps the best way to sum up this book."
2,Am I the only human alive who found this confusing?,"I am not about to recite what everyone else did about condensing the plot, but this was hard to get into..I put it down several times,but made myself finally read it since the comments on the cover were so strong. I made myself finish it and find it a most disjointed piece of literature. Roy obsesses with her personal language and capitalized words thrown in everywhere. I do not suggest reading this to learn about the subculture of India...a place where I lived and hoped to re-visit in print and instead found an self-possessed auther writing for her own audience of one. How this book received any award is beyond my imagination! Do not waste your time reading it!"
4,A Charming Novel,"India has always seemd like an exotic, chaotic place to me. After reading this book, it has become more real; a country populated by people not that different from myself. Their ambitions, heartbreaks, and loves will be recognizable to almost anyone. I rarely find a book so riveting."
5,Lyrical Narration,"I read ""The God of Small Things"" a while back, and must add it is one of the most powerful novels I have ever set my eyes on. The plot was difficult to catch on to at first, but by the end the stray bits and pieces fit together perfectly. With Roy's writing style one is able to view the world through the eyes of Estha and Rahel -- twins lost in a world of adult justice. The coming together of the novel as a whole at the end is truly beautiful. If you really care for a truly rewarding reading experience, if you like to ponder over what you read, if you are ready to know the unknown, if you are an unprejudiced reader who does not try to 'judge' an author without first sampling his or her writing, if you need to understand how myth, history and life are intertwined in the Indian consciousness, just try reading ""The God of Small Things."""
4,Wonderfully Written,"Arundhati Roy has created a masterfully framed novel in which she explores the inner-emotions and events of an unconventional Indian family. Victims of circumstance, the individual members are forced to return home to each other and find that they no longer are a part of the society in which they live. Assumed to be living out the curses of the generations past, the twins the novel is centered around try to come to grips with the life they had led. Roy spins the story through flashbacks keeping the reader enthralled throughout the entire book. Piece-by-Piece the story of the forsaken family is revealed as Roy creates the setting through her wonderfully descriptive words. Roy uses her poetic talents to narrate a story so simple, and yet so intricate the reader's mind will be challenged. If nothing else, Arundhati Roy created a novel that most would enjoy."
3,Interesting plot,Interesting story line but a little aimless and meandering at times. Great character development with a surprising ending. Generally was an okay read.
3,Prose or Poetry??,"I enjoyed this work, but I had to keep reminding myself that it was actually a novel, and not an epic-length poem. The language is beautiful - it flows in and out and curves around until you find yourself reading it aloud. Roy has an elegant descriptive voice that works to the novel's advantage in more ways than you realize.My main complaint is that the characters weren't built up enough. I found myself wanting to learn more about Velutha and Chacko, and felt in the end that I only received a surface-level understanding of most of the characters.I will keep my eyes out for Roy's next novel, as I suspect that the flaws in _The God of Small Things_ are nothing more than growing pains."
5,emotional rollercoaster,"For someone attempting to understand the limitations of love in the asian sub-continent this is a must read. Instead of giving a superficial account, Ms. Roy delves into the frustration of an emotionally restricted society, where too much is taboo. This is an extremely honest portrayal and a true eye-opener. Ms. Roy is a master storyteller and her metaphorical use of the English language is matched by few. Sheer poetry!"
4,It's not a book. It's an experience.,"I read this book during a flight delay; It was the first time that I didn't mind sitting for hours at the airport. I consumed this book like a delicious dessert; Towards the end I slowed down my reading even more hoping to prolong the experience. English is not my first language and I have no expectation of how the English language should be used. I only know that the author's play of words did not frustrated me. I liked the way that tragedy and joy were treated the equally and how nothing was spelled out in obvious terms. It was less of the plots or characters but rather the storytelling itself that cativated me. The only other books that I had ever enjoyed this much were written by Herman Hesse; Not to say that they are at all alike. It could have just been me and my mood at the time of reading. After all, this is just another book-shape hole in the universe."
5,Superbly written-best language/poetics in a long time!,"This book was one of the most richly worded books I have read in a long time. After passing my middle of the book reading glance at the book store, I took this home and have been in love with it ever since. Of course, it didn't win the Booker Prize for nothing. If your a language buff this book will keep you reading and re-reading just to listen to the poetry in this well crafted prose. Rivals Garcia-Marquez."
5,The book I will read forever!,"I was drawn into reading God of Small Things by its title- the curiosity to find out what kind of God is the god of small things. Indeed, I got the answer: the God of small things is the God of small things, period. Once I realized that, I then savoured this rare flavour of literature that dares to dare. Arundhati Roy writes in a way that makes readers readers. At first I thought I would have to be a specialist in Eastern philosophy to plow through this Booker-compartible fiction, gulping what I thought would turn out to be exotic mythology. I was wrong; I only needed to be a willing and patient reader.My literary group enjoyed the novel and rated it the best the group has done so far.(Of course it's the first one we chose!!!) Welldone Roy."
3,"Small, unknown things embody the essence of the large.","Roy's novel is earthy, fleshy. She reminds us that evil, particularly when it is focused on children, is international. We are forced, as westerners to recognize our world with all its flaws in the unfamiliar locus of India, and ourselves in the foreign men, women and children of Roy's book. Like the father who instructs his son in the Chandogya Upanishad, Roy's book takes the smallest of the small and instructs the reader that from this, one can perceive the finest essence of a thing."
2,Disappointing....,"I had high expectations for this book: the reviews were great and it won the Booker Prize. I was disappointed. The book had only a few good moments. I admit that Roy did a good job with some descriptive passages. It wasn't enough to make this a good book. Throughout the story, all the characters remained unlikeable. While I understand that they were caught in a cultural web not of their making, none of the characters was able to break free. The literary devices employed by Roy served as a distraction rather than an enhancement of this story. Also, Roy's disjointed writing style was extremely annoying."
4,Roy puts so much passion in life and living.....,"Roy has made the concept of love and life so beautiful and precious....something we have all taken for granted. Something I learned was that when big things simply can not happen, we tend to stress our lives on smaller things. This only tells us that we should focus our lives on the big dreams we once had in order to prevent our lives to revolve around the less important factors. Roy has also intelligently alluded to other great authors such as Joseph Conrad and traces of Toni Morrison was seen through out the story. I applaud to Arundhati Roy and would recommend this to anyone who has a love for life and living."
2,A Must Read for people who have nothing better to do,"The veritable hosannas for The God of Small Things from yourExpert Editor seem to me inexplicable. Going through the novel, Ifound it to contain wierd imageries, eccentric phrases and an absolute lack of direction. It is a novel that meanders on like the Ganges, directionless and more than a little sullied.It appears to be the product of an infantile imagination which gets sidetracked every so often and is unable to deal effectively with the novel as an art as well literary form. The staple diet of a hyper-educated,post-Woodstock generation, which no doubt attains the same glorious,if temporary,nirvana from this novel as the hippies did from more mundane substances, this novel is best avoided by the rest, who wish to preserve their sanity of mind."
3,A book written to appeal to western ideals of indian literat,"Quite obviously, this book has been written to cater to the western notion of what good literature from India consists of. It is richly laden with the many requisite platitudes of modern works involving discordant, drifting, alienated families and family-members that are defined by one tragic event in their lives; Ammu's character is on the whole largely unsympathetic, and did not evoke any kind of sympathy, except in rare moments when when she displayed odd glimpses of motherhood. In most instances, she is as untypical of an Indian mother as one can be. Rahel has a totally unconvincing character when she is presented to us as an adult, and her brother isn't even given a character as an adult. The entire book is gloomy, which, once again, seems to be a requirement for a book by a modern Indian author to be successful in the west.Really, I fail to understand what the hype and rave reviews are about."
2,"An ""interesting"" book","Ms. Roy had a compelling vision for the book. Somehow thearchitecture and construction cloud the vision and prevent it fromtouching the reader's heart. This is ironic, for the flap says Ms. Roy is an architect by training.What I found frustrating was that I could never get close to the key characters and start to feel for them. Why? Because Ms. Roy continually interrupts, striving to look brilliant herself. This she does using a staccato, ostensibly emotional, style of writing, seemingly endless and trying nature commentary, a flood of parenthetical observations (too many of them, really... RE-A-LLY) and unwarranted capitaLIZations. These divert your attention from the plot and consume your energies away from the poor souls that inhabit her vision.But then, we have to commend Ms. Roy for her accomplishment - getting a book published, much the same way we salute anyone who gets a PhD. For the effort and endurance, irrespective of the quality of the work."
5,"A linguistic fiction, hard to forget","The language of this book is really marvellous. All the small things which have been noticed by her are incredible. Though she had used typical Keralite names, still I can recall each character after six months. The story telling skill of Roy is unbeatable. The small humours she has created are really fabulous like "" The dangling Penis of the madman pointing towards the board COCHIN 26 Kms"", "" The taxi driver desperately trying to kill the straying dog"" etc. The potray of the grown up Rahel is excellent. ( Akwardly beautiful collar bones...) A free flowing tale which will make U stop at several points. A great book noticing very small things. A must read for all whoever likes reading. I really enjoyed every moment, every page, every character and every sentence ""God of Small Things"""
2,Ugh! Why Did I Waste My Time?!,"If you want a depressing tale of twins who grew up in a screwed up family where wife beatings, molestation, rape, murder and incest were the norm, this book is for you. However, the wry observations made of the South Indian class structure were ( I grudgingly admit) on target. This book had no redeeming qualities. Ugh!!!"
2,spoiler alert!,"Such a drag. really, I like poetry, but there were pages and pages and pages of descriptions. Also, how do you make incest boring?? Well, this author managed it. I would have loved this book as a moody teenager. Not so much now."
2,Overly scented,"The author gets credit for a heartfelt tale but I found the writing so overwrought and flowery. So much so that it detracted from the story.I'm all for metaphors but this book trys too hard with a barrage of wordage. A perfect example of more is less. Sorry, I wished I could have liked this book."
1,Absolutely Stomach Wrenching and Insipid,The style of this writing is uncreative and nearly drives the reader to insanity. Roy tries to pull off some sort of Pulp Fiction plot with the time frame jumping all over the place and making the novel difficult to want to follow. Her attempt to replicate the thought patterns of children is childish and a dismal failure in itself. I've never been more dissatisfied with a book.
2,"Master of Language, Terrible at storytelling","There is no dispute about it, the book is beautifully written in a very poetic language. But Roy is terrible at telling the story and portraying characters. Other than the general image of sadness and tradegy, the book offers nothing more than a superficial exotic shadow. This is a major Booker disappointment."
2,My thoughts,"I did not enjoy this book. I judge a book, partially, by the distractions of the author's writing style and errors. This book is one distraction after another. I had great difficulty keeping track of the story line. The characters were not admirable or intriguing."
3,"Great Language, Poor Novel","Arundhati Roy's God of Small Things is a wonderful piece of literature; as I have always maintained, this female can write. Her command over the English language is comparable to very few. Although beautiful for the language, the book as such was pretty average -- if only she had devoted more time in developing her characters, instead of describing Kerala with so much detail, things would have been different. On a side note, if this book won the Booker Prize, I am totally at a loss to justify Adiga's White Tiger winning it at a later date!"
2,I was lost!,"Arundhati Roy wrote a very interesting story and has a good command of the language. Unfortunately, I was lost in the stream-of-consciousness style of writing. She jumped from person-to-person much like Virginia Woolf, without using the Woolfian sentence structure. If that's not difficult enough, I had to unravel the chronology. She jumps between two different time periods and often jumps again within the same time period. It made for a confusing mess, to say the least. Nonetheless, the plot lines are solid and the writing itself is solid.If you understand Indian culture or have been to India, you would probably get a lot out of this book. If you have no interest in India, feel free to skip this one."
4,A treasure to read,"Rich in language and color and characters. I've read this book twice, which I never do. That's how much I enjoyed it!"
4,Very powerful....,I also had a hard time getting through this book. I would read a chapter and put it down for a couple of days. I was distracted by the style of writing (very poetic) and kinda grossed out by some of the characters. I didn't even like the twins who are the main characters. There were several times when I didn't want to pick it back up to finish it.I am so glad I did. I finished the book several days ago and am still haunted by the ending. I feel sad about Rahel and Estha but it was Velutha and Ammu's relationship which was the most powerful for me. How tragic and so beautiful. Definitely worth your time...
5,very compelling read,I agree with the reader who says that this book needs to be read asecond time in order to fully understand it. The first read usually leaves you a little confused and wondering what the entire thing was about. The story is a little disjointed and only a second pass helped me to associate the flash backs and flash forwards. But I'm glad I did. This definitely is a lot more substance than I've read in a while. People who have given up on it should definitely give it a second try.
5,Prose turned into Poetry,"This is a book which I have now read many times, each time finding something new to enjoy and ponder. Roy is that most rare of writers, a woman who can turn prose into pure poetry. I found myself reading over the same paragraph three or four times, savouring the text in the same way that you try to make your favourite dessert last longer by eating it slowly. I finished the book and wanted to read it over again - it haunted my mind for weeks. A book to buy and treasure."
5,I loved it!,"I loved this book. Sorry to say that my husband threw it at the wall and never finished it. That's the way it is with magical realism and loose story spinning. But if you just float with it, accept the imagery and the magic, you will be rewarded with a poignant sensitive tale of a family gone asunder, and how easily emotions, fate and circumstance lead to tragedy. Not for everyone, but you will probably know right away. A sweet sad book, and much better than lots of other highly touted novels out there, not to mention any names!! PS If you like this novel, read House of the Spirits by Allende."
2,not for me,"I bought this book because everyone in my book club loved it. I am now the outcast. I did not get it. I never even could finish reading it. I do believe this was the first book I have not finished. I found it to be boring and confusing. I do believe I would try to read other books by Arundhati Roy, just as long as they are not like this one."
4,An excellent summer book with amazing description,"I found that this book lacked on plot a little, but being a fan of the words themselves as well as a storyline, I certainly felt that it made up in description.Arundhati Roy writes in a style which is fully conscious of the fact that it is literature; sentences paragraphs and chapters are constructed with such delicacy that the novel could be confused with poetry of long lineage.The culture discussed is discussed in an intelligent way, and the relationship between twins is impossibly presented in beautiful realism, with two unique, inextricable characters created within Rahel and Estha.I enjoyed it greatly, but it seems so genre unspecific, it is a voyage into the unknown which will be kindly rewarded.Warning: don't read if a climactic ending is all important to you."
5,Fabulous,"Roy does amazing things with language. This is a haunting story told in a way you probably haven't encountered before. Beautiful, beautiful words, which are all the more remarkable for their sharp contrast to Roy's tough subject matter."
3,Good but a bizarre ending,"Good language and philosophy et al but what did the author mean when she ended up with the ending she used. Good bringing up of the system prevalent in south india and as an indian i feel it was well potrayed, but then again breaking of love laws for intercaste marriages is alright but outright incest is not a fit ending."
3,"overdose of wordplay, overwhelmingly pessimistic","Agreed, wordplay is original and impactful but after awhile it becomes a real chore. Similarly her characters and storyline become a burden, oversteeped as they are in their dysfunctionality and tragic overtones. More of a showcase for prose lovers on use of metaphors."
2,A well-meaning case of the vapors,"There are many people in this story, many smells, sights, sounds, traumatic events, nonsense words, distortions of time and perception, confusing paragraphs that require re-reading, -- all in the service of a James Michener-type of family saga that illustrates the sad-but-true dictum that talented people (or untalented, for that matter) can be so screwed up by lack of nurturance that they are essentially crippled for life. There is heartbreak and sadness and inconsolable pain in these characters' lives. But unfortunately, Roy's clutter-it-up approach interferes."
3,"A vi-able,en-vi-able work of Dubious Bookerworthiness","Much like the Indian west coast culinary concoction Avial, this work is a colourful, flavourful albeit owerpowering piece of literary mish-mosh. Its style is compelling and haunting although it eventually becomes forced, repetitious, distracting and tiresome in its pretentiousness.The best thing one can say about it is that it is an 'easy read' the reason why it is so popular, in my opinion. As for Booker-worthiness, I have yet to find someone who thinks that its is as good as the Heat and Dust or Midnight's Children....... Arundathi Undhathi dhathi. thi. i. I REST MY CASE."
1,Hard to follow - not enjoyable,This book was incredibly hard to follow and very difficult to read. I usually enjoy Booker prize winners but not this one! I do not recommend it to anyone.
2,Need an annotated version . . .,"This book has amazing metaphors and the ability to help the adult reader remember what it used to be like to think as a child. That being said, I found this book extremely difficult to read. The ""plot"", such as it is, continually and abruptly moves from one time frame to another. I understand the ""stream of conciousness"" concept, but some streams are very difficult to flow with and follow. Also, the author uses so many terms from India that this reader wished for a glossary in the back in order to understand what was being described. For someone who is not familiar with East Indian culture, it was very difficult to make sense of just what the author was refering to in many passages. I read for enjoyment and this book was just too impressionistic to be an enjoyable read."
1,Pseudo-intellectual,"I consider this book the written version of modern art's ""big yellow dot"". In any modern art museum you'll find a large black canvas with nothing but a big yellow dot on it. No matter what obtuse meaning pseudo-intellectuals ascribe to that painting, it remains that it's no more than a big yellow dot.""God of Small Things"" is the written equivalent. It will no doubt continue to be popular in some circles as some readers ascribe deep meaning to its confusing plot lines and verbiage. But deep in my heart I believe the vast majority of people are saying (if only under their breath), ""Why in the world did I read this book?"""
3,help!,"hi, im miranda, 16 and in london. i read this book and i gotta do a revies in front of the class about it, and it cant just be read our boringly, its gotta be different. so anyhone got any ideas 4 me> PLEEEEEEEZE!"
3,try it on for size,"okay, okay, so the language might not be what we're all used to, what we know how to appreciate. The endless repetition, the capitalization, and the metaphors and similes. the truncated sentences. It all seems a bit taxing, overdone, effusive and needless.But is wouldn't be fair to stop there. The characters are human, idiosyncratic, comical and pathetic. The reader can't help but cluck and coo over the little twins, roll his eyes at Baby Kochamma, feel Ammu's terror and desperation. The family, so realistic, could be mine or yours. The plot begins simply, and gives only hints of the extraordinary, horrible events to come.In short, despite its awkward shortcomings, the novel will invoke one to empathy, sensitivity, outrage. It might allow the reader to appreciate love for what it is, for the various forms in which it comes.sorry for the comma splices, dangling preps,etc.Enjoy."
2,predictable and pretentious,"I have read this book with an open, non-stubborn mind;it is not a masterpiece by any means. In fact it sometimes reads like the first (rough) draft of a high school creative writing class entry.The author tries to be inventive in her language. Unfortunately the experiment does not come off. The words confuse rather than enlighten. At times the prose reads like a fifth rate Indian version of Faulkner or Joyce (no ethic slur intended here). It just doesn't work."
2,A disappointment,"I did not need a review to buy this book: a book by an Indian woman, and a delectable title. I knew I wanted to read it. Buying a book is a rare treat for me. I made a mistake when I bought ""The God of Small Things."" I love transporting prose, and an unconventional (or post-modernist) style will not put me off, as long as the story is served and I can submerge myself in the author's vision. Roy's writing never served her story or characters. It hovered self-consciously and annoyingly over the characters and their lives, never giving me a chance to know them or care what happened to them, or what it might mean in the context of a real world.I will not recommend this book to my friends or book group, and I am disappointed that it beat another splendid book, Cold Mountain, for the Booker Prize."
4,"If you're brain dead, don't read this book","If you're brain dead, don't read this book - you won't comprehend its subtle beauty. If you find ""Must see TV"" enthralling, you won't understand the power of this book. This book requires the reader to use both sides of the brain - if you can't do that, you're lost. You might as well go back to laughing at ""Just Shoot Me"" or is ""Smackdown"" more your style?"
2,.... please.,"I had to read this book for school, which might be part of the reason I found it to be so bad. Usually, I'll read anything and most of the time won't have any complaints about it. I don't understand how this book won the Booker Prize. Many praise the language Ms. Roy uses; I found it to be annoying. She writes in sentence fragments. This book is a frame story and the reader already knows what will happen. The problem is that she doesn't give the reader reason to care about the characters enough to read on so I spent most of the book struggling to get through chapter after chapter of pointless description and local color. In retrospect, there wasn't really much activity in this book, just a lot of rambling and multiple descriptions of characters' pasts that got repetative quite quickly.I gave this book two stars instead of one because I believe that, in the future, Ms. Roy may produce something less devoid of emotion. But perhaps I am being optimistic."
5,Helps You Understand Better,"I read this book when our daughter was in a residential treatment center for adoption related emotional problems. It was very helpful in understanding some of the emotional challenges she faced, especially as an Asian in a Caucasian family. It also helped me understand more about my Mom who was adopted in an era when adoption was outside the norm. I recommend this book to anyone with an adopted child or who was adopted themselves."
1,Reads like a bad term paper.,"This is the worst book on adoption I have read (and I have read quite a few) The authors (none of whom are directly part of the adoption triad)try to analyze development across the lifespan of the adoptee according to an Eriksonian model (in fact I think 1/4 of all the words in the book may be Erik Erikson or Eriksonian) At times they are downright offensive to both adoptees and birthparents, and they never seem to have any illumination into what it is actually like to be an adoptee - maybe that is because they have talked to a lot of them, and analyzed a lot of them, but they just don't really understand it on a deeper level. I would hope that anyone truly interested in this subject would read Betty Jean Lifton's Journey of the Adopted Self instead."
3,"Okay, but repeat of many other better books","This was the third book I read as I began my search for my birth mother. It was repetative from other help books on searching and adoption and since I did not experience any negative feelings all my life from being adopted, I can't say that I can relate at all to some of the comments, stories, etc. It does have some good points though for helping in the search process."
3,Somewhat painful to read,"Although this book has some very good information, I might suggest readingit after you have adopted your child/children. It's a bit like hearing all of the very difficult parts of raising children at the same time. It was pretty overwhelming campared to many of the other books out there."
5,Excellent resource for all members of the adoption triad,"Thank goodness people are finally admitting that adoption, even if you had a great experience, still brings with it certain issues. Adoptive parents should read books like this to understand that their adopted child has special needs - so many adoptives take it as a personal affront if their child decides to search for birthparents, or even asks about them. For birthparents, it's affirmation of their loss (even if it was the best decision they felt they could make) and understanding of their surrendered child's feelings. Should be required reading for prospective adoptive parents"

4,Good clean fun! Really!,"This punk-rock Supergroup features members of Lagwagon, No Use For A Name and NOFX, and has crafted a great and often hilarious record. I don't know half of these songs, but the other half are both rockin' and a chuckle to listen to. ""I am a Rock"" is probably my favorite; somehow it translates very successfully to the punk forum. Other standouts are ""Danny's Song"", ""Fire and Rain"", ""Sweet Caroline"" and ""Rocket Man."" The vocals are ably handled by Spike, suprisingly melodic and beautiful in places.I was surprised to see so many reviews by people who didn't get the joke. This isn't a serious band, it's a bunch of guys from Fat Wreck Chords who thought it would be a kick to do a record of covers and get Spike to sing on 'em. I think it works, and there is legitimate musicianship here to appreciate. This one finds its way into my deck again and again... if you like NOFX and have a sense of humor (important!), this record is worth a whirl"
4,Covers never sounded so good,"The first time I heard this cd I was dumbfounded, I knew the songs and I never would have imagined punk versions of them, but I'm glad they did. ""Me and Julio"" and ""I am a Rock"" are badass, and all the rest aren't much worse. The only downfall to this album is how short it is (28 minutes or something). Overall, there isn't much music out there that is more perfect to drive to."
3,Why does everyone have to dog the 70's music?,"I appreciated the new twist on the old tunes as much as the next person, especially ""Seasons in the Sun,"" but I don't see why the other reviewers have to dog the performers of the originals. Some of them may be slightly cheesy (Barry Manilow comes to mind), but there is no question that Paul Simon rocks and he always has. ""Me and Julio down by the Schoolyard"" was not in any way cheesy in the original version."
3,"sorry, not a 5 star band","does it bother anyone else that all this band can play is covers? I love them, and the cd is in my cd player at least once a week... but no, you can't give them 5 stars, sublime is more like a five star band, and in terms of a punk band, a 5 star band would at least have to write some of there own lyrics, that actually mean something. check out operation ivy"
3,bad but good,What I like about this band is that they take songs that everyone hates and makes them worth listening to. This cd makes an exotic twist in my cd collection which is cool i guess. Whats wrong with this cd is that all he does at the end of every song is yell and scream yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. After i got sick of this cd which was about two times through i took a shot gun and shot it until nothing was left.
2,Seemed like a good idea,"""Punk"" covers of sacchrine tunes from my youth? Sure-I'll take one of those. ""What Kind of Fool Am I""? You ain't no punk, you PUNK! Sterile 80's/90's ""punk"". If you think MTV/Green Day is punk/r-n-r, then have a ball. BO-RING!"
1,poor text,The text is bad.There are part I could not read or understand. I would not recomend this book to anyone.
5,If you only own one book about art . . .,"If you could only own one book about art, this book should be it. The reproductions are true, the writing insightful, and the coverage extensive. All significant periods in art history are covered, including non-western, and the book is more than just about art, but about history, as well. I found some fascinating tidbits that I didn't know before: the Emporer Claudius proposed to the Roman Senate that Christianity be officially recognized (the Senate refused); the Chinese practiced a form of Cubism centuries before Picasso and Braque; archeologists date the arrival of Christianity in areas by how the dead were buried (all pretty cool stuff). This is one of those books that is worth rereading with the expectation of greater enjoyment the second time around."
2,Good book but not enough detail,I liked the content of this book but was dissapointed in how short the book was. I also think the book is overpriced for it's size. I would have liked it much better had the author given more stories or examples of past ouija experiences. Anyone using a ouija board for the first time would like more details of what actually happens and what is said during a session before they attempt it themselves. I think all the book needs is to be expanded and it would then be a great book.
2,Good sound but headband is too tight for big heads,"I've got an XL size head, and I find that this headphone clamps on my noggin painfully tight. The headband is made of a strong springy-steel metal strap wrapped with a thin layer of padding. Maybe it will fit small heads better.The sound is good.Sitting next to my computer's cooling fan, I can easily verify that the active noise-reduction does indeed work -- just turn the switch for the headphone power on and off, and there's a noticeable difference.The headphones come with an adapter for airline seats.It requires AAA batteries that are not included -- these fit into a finger-sized controller that is on the cord, not on the headset."
4,basically remixes,"These are essentially extended versions of songs on the LP Nude. ""Come Home With Me Baby"" gets a little bit of a housier beat and some hilarious samples thrown on the top. Otherwise it's pretty much extended bits for DJs to mix with. If you like Nude then you will like this; it's pure early-90s dance music either way."
2,Check the sizes!,"Although there is nothing really ""wrong"" with this product, it didn't work for me and my dog. He has a very short muzzle, but a very big head. The muzzle was constantly rubbing up and down his nose, and he could slip out of it very easily. I would recommend sizing your dogs muzzle very carefully before purchasing."
2,Where's the Beef?,"When I ordered this book, I was anxious to receive it. Listed with 300 pages, I expected in-depth information. Though Denis Gilles photographs are indeed superb, and although almost every topic on nature photography is discussed, it was very disappointing that only a page or two was given for each topic. Overview yes, in-depth information no. If you want to learn from a master, invest in a book by John Shaw."
4,Crosley 1940s style system,I have had very good luck with this system. The sound is excellent. The remote control works well.
5,Great Childrens book!!!,"Last summer I borrowed this book from the library for my daughter who was then 3. Although we had borrowed many other books, this one was our favorite. We would read it over and over and over. This is a great book for any little girl who is bursting to start using her imagination!!"
4,PARADISE FOUND (AGAIN),"GET THIS OUTSTANDING DUVET SET, IT WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO GO TO BED EARLY! OR AT LEAST LEAVE THE BEDROOM DOOR OPEN SO YOUR GUESTS CAN SEE IT.1 BEAUTIFUL COLORS2 OUTSTANDING NEEDLE WORK ON THE PALMS"
5,Feels like 500 Thread Count!,What a wonderful duvet! I bought it for my teenage daughters' bedroom but was jealous as soon as I opened the package! The pleats and embroidery give it a finished and expensive look and it feels great to the touch. I recommend it to everyone - girls and guys!
2,i expected more,the book has one big saving grace. it has a interesting way of making us think about honor. how we define it. the action gets way to mystical for my liking but some of the japanese characters are very interesting. if you have read the others then read this one.
2,it was ok,the kaisho was alright. There was a little too much of business talk and the main character seemed to have less lines than anybody else...if you like detailed ninja...supernatural stuff then you'll like it.
4,Ehh...,"It was a good book with a good story line. As one of the readers who reviewed this, it does redefine honor. The only problem is that it's boring on some parts with business talk and such. It's worth reading, thoguh"
1,Nicholas Linnear - Who is he?!,Nicholas Linnear is the main caracter in the book - at least the back of the book says so. But he appears only now and then.But that is lucky because his parts in the book are more than boring.The small background part about the young Okami and Nichola's father is okey though.
1,Don't waste your time,"The dragonlance series has been a personal favorite since the chronicles. I have read every book margaret and Tracy had to offer. Since I began the series in middle school, I have re-read them several times, each time enjoying it just as much as the last. It has been a long journey into the world of Krynn!The fact that margaret and tracy let other authors use their world, and completely destroy it, angers me. Publicity and money must be worth more than the fans....This book was ridiculously painful to read....A terrible plot....underdeveloped characters....and a seemingly disproportioned writing style don't just bore the reader, but if they are a dragonlance fan, angers them.This BUTCHERS the series....if you are a fan, steer clear...if you are a first timer to the series, Stick to Margaret and Tracys' books ONLY.If i could give it negative stars, I would."
1,Avoid this book like the plauge,"I picked up this book expecting to be enthralled by interessting characters and devious (& very evil) bad guys wrapped up in an epic quest. I will admit the dragons were cool but everything else was terrible! The characters were boring and 2 dimentional. The book also felt rushed, no indepth descriptions here! They just seem to move to location to location. The new magic was pathetic (anyone can use it, great.....) and Blister well, didn't apear very kender like! Do yourself a favor! Wait for Weis and hickman's new trilogy and imagine this one was just a bad dream....."
1,"I'm sorry, but this was awful!!!","Truth to say, I couldn't stand it. This is a book best suited to readers 9-10 years of age. Why did Jean Rabe get the contract to write this??????"
3,"Excellent front cover, pity about the content.",A dissappointing continuation of a fantastic series. But a must read for people (like me) who require closure.
4,Not nearly as bad as some say!,"The characters are an interesting bunch. They do, however, lack the specialised personalities Weis and Hickman have given theirs. The story is nevertheless very interesting. I was surprised a couple of times, by what happened next. The sequence of events do not come accross as being bunched together but rather as events one leading to another. I would like to see that the personalities and character of the individuals are explored a bit more. I found the ending rather exciting and also found that I had an urge to go out and look for the next title of the trilogy. A worth-while read."
3,Takes a few pages to get started,"This book reminds me a lot of the first of the Dragonlance Chronicles. I didn't like it much until I got into the second book. I'm now almost done with the second book in this series and I like it a lot. 350 pages isn't enough to do it justice. I'm always a big fan of making BIG books to completely tell a story. I think with a few hundred more pages this book could have been spectacular. As it stands, I'm pleased with this book,I liked the idea of the Dragon overlords, I liked the links that are being made to other Dragonlance stories, but felt the characters were not very fleshed out. And the action scenes were rushed."
1,This Book deserves no stars.,"Okay all you who think this book is semi to really good, read it again and tell me what you think. This book is incredibly dumb, boring and to top it off, it screws up the famous characters that Weis and Hickman created and who we fell in love with. My suggestion is to skip this series (or if you read it) go on to Weis and Hickmans' ""Great repair on Rabes trajedy"" Dragons of the Fallen Sun. This book basically points out that the New age stories are a Crock of bull and trys to repair the damage done by the butcher of Dragonlance Jean Rabe. Dont spend your money on this book. Stay with the Legends wies And hickman."
2,More of an add on book then a 'main' plot,"Characters were unoriginal. Oh my gosh! Dhamon is a knight of Takhisis, what a surprise!?!? The kender was a poor man's Tasslehoff. The pirates?? disgusting characters..really..which cause you to sometimes think you're watching an episode of Hercules: the Legendary Journeys. Also, Palin was a complete and utter disappointment. He was supposed to be such a great character but became nothing more than a peon in the 5th Age. All the characters were poorly developed, cliche and boring. Rabe tries to make the characters unique like the kender with the glove, but doesn't succeed at all. Where's Raistlin, Tanis and Sturm when you need them? The plot is dreadful and boring. Even Weiss and Hickman's Chronicles weren't that great, they were interesting at least with characters such as Raistlin. But 5th Age? Give it a try, but dont' expect another Dragons of Autumn Twilight"
3,i really don't know what to make of this book,"What can i say. the book has its good points, one thing that really disturbed me though was that the kender was nothing like it should be. They seemed to skip about 6 books that should explain about how magic came back into the world and i'd like to here a little more depth in the characters, the author is rushing it too much maybe if the triliogy was 6 books she could have written it well. over all this book decently explained a few points that i was missing, although a little more detail would have been appreciated"
2,This could have been so much better.,"I read this and I was disapointed, the feel was wrong Palin was wrong and the Kender were wrong. Jean Rabe is not a bad auther but she shouldn't have tried to follow from weis and hickman. There are some good points to this book and all dragonlance fans should read it and the rest of the series, just to keep up to date with the world of krynn."
2,Work better left for another author,"Perhaps the biggest tragedy associated with 'The Dawning of a New Age' is that there is vital 5th age information contained within its pages, but the reader must plod through Jean Rabe's drivel to get to it. An outline would be better.It's time for Dragonlance/Wizards of the Coast to replace Jean Rabe... w/Chris Pierson? He showed potential with his Kingpriest Trilogy. I don't foresee myself ever purchasing one of her books again (and from the reviews below it seems that many longtime Dragonlance fans share this sentiment). If the Fifth Age is to take hold it definitely needs a new voice.To anyone who gives this book 4 stars: I encourage you to read earlier Dragonlance novels (Chronicles, Legends, Elven Nations, etc) or other contemporary Dragonlance trilogies (Ergoth). That's 4 star writing."
1,"Mercy, please!","I gave it one star because it was grammatically correct, for the most part. You'd be surprised how authors can write without grammar. I never liked Jean Rabe's style much, and I think that this book sums up everything bad about it. Her characters are badly done, and the characters she borrows from others are unrecognizable. None of the easy dialogue seen in other DL books. The plot seems to crawl along, going nowhere until the very end, and once it's over, it seems the journey just wasn't worth the trouble. You're better off reading Weis, Hickman, Knaak, etc."
4,Th Dawning of a New Age,"This book was an excelant addition to the Dragon Lance seris that should not be missed. Any one who thinks other wise does not recognize good literature. It is not as good as the conclusion to the Dawning of a new age saga , The Eve Of the Malestrom, however it is still definatley worth reading."
1,"this will get better if I keep reading,won't it?","Like some of the other reviewers, I read the first two parts of the Dhamon Saga before I read this book,and though they were great. I am also a long time DL and Forgotten realms fan. When I saw this book I was eager to read it and very disappointed.One dimensional characters ( including the dragons),improbable fight scenes, some pointless deaths and a sudden ending. Not a cliffhanger - it was as though she just stopped writing ( and there is a certain blessing in that)The artwork - well some things are better left unsaid. There is nothing wrong in looking at traditional settings and characters from a ""new"" angle but some of the character differences were so extreme that she might have been better off creating a whole new world. Frankly it is hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as those Dhamon novels ( and I do look forward to Redemption )"
4,"Good book, can't believe how some hate it","Okay, the animations are poor, and the characters aren't the greatest but it's still a good read, hardly garbage like some state. I enjoyed reading about the new dragons, and about the adventures of these new less appealing heroes. Blister and Feril are especially stupid, but the rest aren't too bad. Ok, this ain't Weis and Hickman but that doesn't mean it's not worth awhile."
1,This Book has brought DL to SHAME!,"This is one of the WORST Dragonlance books that I have ever read. I own every DL book, except the Villians series. I was excited that the 5th age was coming out. Something different, no gods, or magic. When I bought this book, I read half of it and had to throw it down in disgust. Then later, after I read all the other books that DL had out, I picked it up again and read it. Jean Rabe is a horrible writer! kender don't act like kender, The new healers can heal every hero that is almost to the death at every fight, the Tower of High Sorcery is destroyed with alittle mutter of magic, yet no magic in world yet. And there is a time period from the Choas war & the Dragons. Why didn't the good dragons take on the Ancient dragons w/ dragonlances b4 they were to strong instead of hiding like cowards? That was an age of warriors of a finished war. To all the Loyal DL readers; Save urself the frustation of this book."
1,The Dawning of a New Age,This book is terrible. Rabe apparently has not read many other Dragonlance books. She starts off by taking away the tower of High Sorcery in Palanthas and then making Dalamar just drop off the face of existance. Her characters have no personality either. The plot is [bad] and since when does Goldmoon have magical powers? and just how many dwarven mystics besides Jasper are there? Rabe must have like scimmed through a couple of Dragonlance books and tried to just improv this series. The battles are always one sides with defiant victories no matter how great the odds the good guys always get out with hardly a scratch. It just not very Dragonlance like and the rest of the books get worse from here. Take my advice and dont even buy this...
2,"""Dawning"" symbolizes twilight of Dragonlance Saga","This books is by far one of the worst Dragonlance novels yet written. The fifth age is as unintersting as it could have possibly been made. The characters are all cheesy ""bizarro"" rip offs of the original companions. Let's face it, with the possible exception of Richard A Knaak, no one but Weis and Hickman seems to be able to write a Dragonlance novel worth a damn.....""Summer Flame"" was a good enough ending for the series. Please god just let it die now, while it still has some dignity. Maybe Wizards of the Coast will do us all a favor and have Jean Rabe sent down to the basement to edit press releases or something. This might be worth reading if you're twelve or dyslexic...."
2,Great Story - Bad writing.,"I have enjoyed the DL saga for many years, mainly because of Weis and Hickmans writing. And so now they have left a very important story in the Dragonlance Saga to Jean Rabe who obviously can't write at all. Her charcters are shallow and her villains aren't very interresting either. The only reason for reading this pile of incohernt babble is to get the background knowledge for ""The War of Souls"" by Weis and Hickman which is Dragonlance at it's best."
1,Sadness,"I have been a faithful devotee of the Dragonlance series since I was a lonely 12 year old in middle school with nothing else going for me but an uncanny knack for grammar and a bit of skill with a pen. I thrilled to the incredible writing of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and was inspired by their characters. However, I come to read this book and I am truly and deeply appalled. I find the writing lackluster and uninteresting, the characters typical and completely flat. I hated the heroes and I was bored by the villains. Every plot twist sounded to me like the plotless drivel I wrote when I was about 10 with a friend, and I just found myself devastated that the series I loved was turned over to someone without half of the skill that Weis and Hickman possessed. I almost boycotted the series in angry protest. However, with the Soulforge novels, I find forgiveness in my heart, but I do not at all recommend this novel to anyone who doesn't want to waste hours of their life."
3,"At the sum of all things, a good book","The books may not be in the same level as Dragons of a Fallen Sun (and sure as hell not at the same level asChronicles and Legends), but Jean rabe do come thru and provides us with an exciting trilogy. The charecters dosen't have nuch depth, that's true, and by the time you finish the oh so-predictable 1st book and realize that absolutely nothing happened over the last 300 pages or so you just want to scream, but the 2nd and 3rd books are much better then the 1st and as a whole, the trilogy is definatly enjoyable. Anyway, we got to rid it to keep up with the 5th Age timeline - so I suggest doing the best of it, but try and find it in the libary instead of buying it. P.S: Pardom the typoes, English is my 3rd language."
2,not good,"Rabe's characters keep mouthing words to each other for some reason, and winning fights against absurd odds."
1,very dissappointed,"Alright... so I finish reading the newer Weiss & Hickman books, and while they're not of the same flavor as the older ones, they show a level of writer maturity and solid plot lines, not to mention excellent character development. Then the story ends and ""Dawning of a New Age"" picks up. I've always been apprehensive of Dragonlance books outside of Weiss & Hickman anyway... and now I truly know why. The plot was all over the place, character development was very shallow, and it fealt like I was playing a board game and not reading a book - I'm sorry, but there should have been better editing before letting this hit the market. Yikes."
1,Just bad.,"This book is just too linear. Doesn't have the feeling of a Dragonlance setting. Kender who didn't act like kender, 'civilized' Wild Elves, etc. Perhaps Ms. Rabe has not yet settled in Krynn. Pity. The idea is good but the story doesn't go along. My DM makes better adventures!"
1,kender,Ok one sentence should explain my increasingly chaotic feelings. The kender is afraid. Yes you read that right. The token Burrfoot is a lass named Blister who got a burn when she was young and she becomes afraid a lot. Is the sea churning up?? She's afraid. Is there a powerful wyvern? Yup... she's afraid. I actually felt betrayed reading this and seeing Basic knowledge being ignored. Also....<and I know this was pointed out somewhat in an earlier post> in the last book of Flame it was basically stated that magic was dead. Hell Palin couldnt get Raistlins Staff to light up! Suddenly its not that bad? Methinks the corporation didnt want the cash-cow to die. Anyway true fans... let a friend buy the book and borrow it.
1,Complete garbage,"All this book did was to crumble my image of the Dragonlance world. So read this book at your own risk. Jean Rabe should have started a whole new trilogy instead of ripping off the Dragonlance name. Well, in the authors defense, Hickman and Weis did not give her much left to work with (they did a good job at completing the Dragonlance trilogy in Dragons of Summer Flame). After reading this book, I will not even pick up a new Dragonlance book unless it is by either Weis or Hickman (Soulforge is an awesome book). Don't read this book, save your money, your time, and your brain."
1,"DragonLance? Yeah, I remember that...","This book is absolutely pathetic; no more than a cheezy spin-off of an otherwise classic series. Souless characters, no plot to speak of, and written in a style I'd expect of a third grader. Seems TSR will do anything for a few bucks now-a-days. This might be good if you're six...might. Avoid!"
2,Not Cypress Hill's best work,"What can I say this isnt Cypress Hill's best cd. Most of the beats sound bland at best. B-real sounds out of place on Ganja bus. There are a few gems on this cd though like Latin thugs, Busted in the hood( remake of the Beasties Paul Revere), Whats your number, and till death do us part. Cypress Hill's best work was Temples of Boom thier new cd isnt even close to it. It for the most part it sounds average with bland beats and uncreative rhymes."
4,These guys can make anything sound good......,"I love the 'Hill. I agree with a previous reviewer who said this album sounds too forced and over-produced. I like it, but it definitely is NOT classic CH. I appreciate their desire to experiment to find what works for them, but they are the original latin thugs, why try and fight it?? Great group, great album, but wrong group for the style changes. At least Stoned Raiders brought in MC Ren for a smokin' guest spot, and also played to their strengths in kickin' out the East LA bumper ""Low Rider."" I understand that the TOB style may not be a trendsetting challenge for Muggs, but that is CH; Muggs can experiment in plenty of other avenues. Anyway, it's great to see 'em BACK!"
4,Cypress Hill change things up and score their best in years,"When Temples of Boom and Black Sunday came out, this groups sound was fresh and original. As the years wore on, however, things just got repetative. The guys in Cypress Hill must have finally seen the light, because the sound has definitely changed on Till Death Do Us Part. This is a ska and reggae influenced record filled with infectious dance beats that manage to avoid sacrificing the edge prevailent in the best hip hop. There's nothing really ground breaking here, just a solid record with a strong single ""What's Ya Number"" and some clever turns, such as the redo of The Beastie Boys ""Paul Reviere"". Add this solid hip hop CD to your collection."
4,CYPRESS IS BACK,well this cd starts off amazing but as other have said its slows down in the later track. i myself have been a cypress hill fan for long n none of their cd gon beat number 4 but this cd is the next best thing. this cd is crazy cause 1 song thats latin thugs... this song is the next tequila sunrise. i also liked this cd cause cypress hill rap alot in spanish n sen dog gots the flow. i give this cd 4 stars cause its good but wont beat number 4 but still good grab this cd latin thugs is a crazy song for the vatos out there..peace
3,Afer a Few Listens...,"I wasn't too thrilled with this album when I first bought it. Truthfully, I wasn't that thrilled the next 4-5 times I put it in the player. However, I just sat down today and realized, well, it's actually not a bad album. The first track, ""Another Body Drops,"" is real nice - a menacing little beat and some verses about murder. Such originality...But anyway, front to back, it's a decent album, but really not much better than that. You can listen to it, and enjoy it at the time, but aside from the opening track, and ""What's your Name?"", it's a fairly forgettable album. Still, as background music for brushing your teeth, you could do a lot worse."
2,Disappointing,"This album has got to be among the worst album that the Hill has put out. I am deeply disappointed. After Stoned Raiders I thought they couldnt do worse. Boy was I wrong. The album starts out very good. The Alchemist-produced ""Latin Thugs"" was superb. His beats are always bangers. I think it was cool that B-real took a backseat with his verse. ""Ganja Bus"" wasn't as bad as some users said in the other reviews. Nice reggae/reggeaton beat. After the first 4 or 5 songs, the album takes a turn for the worse. I found myself bored. Cypress needs to go back to the vaults and come up with that classic formula that attracted much of their fanbase."
1,OMG!,ummmm......all i can say is why? this album [***] and sounds nothing like when they first popped. But it's not their fault cuz most hip hop is dead now. But I wouldn't buy this if you didn't have too.
3,They have made better,"I am huge CH fan and was excited to get the new album. After getting into the right mind frame I straped on the head phones. Weak, is the only way I could describe this album. I had high hopes but felt let down by the end. Iam still listening to it now and trying to get into it. I feel CH has kinda gone down hill in recent years which being a huge fan is disapointing. I loved temples of boom and most of all black sunday but this album just kinda lets you down. Hopefully their next album will be a little better."
4,Cypress Hills Back.,"When I bought this album i was afraid that i'd be disappointed, because ""What's your Number?"" was not a very good single, but i was surprised by this album. Songs like Never Know,One Last Cigarette,and Busted in the hood,really stood out. Still It's nothing like Temples of Boom, which has to be their hardest album."
3,"NOT BAD, COULD BE BETTER","CYPRESS HILL WAS ALWAYS AGAINST THE GRAIN, NOW I THINK THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS. ON THEIR NEW ALBUM..TILL DEATH DO US PART, THEY SEEM KIND OF LOST LIKE THEY KNOW THIS IS THEIR LAST ALBUM BEFORE THEY GET DROPPED BY THE RECORD LABEL. LETS LOOK AT THE BAD FIRST THEN END WITH THE GOOD. THE BAD: 16 TRACKS-5 WORTH LISTENING TO. I DON'T LIKE THE NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT AN ALBUM, I WANT TO KNOW THE GOOD THINGS SO LET'S SKIP TO THE GOOD. THE GOOD TRACKS ARE:1-LATIN THUGS-A SOUTH OF THE BORDER SMOOTH ROMP 2-BUSTED IN THE HOOD-A REDO OF THE CLASSIC BEASTIE BOYS TRACK PAUL REVERE 3-NEVER KNOW-CLASSIC CYPRESS HILL 4-WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER-B-REAL NEEDS LOVE AND GETS A LITTLE HELP FROM TIM ARMSTRONG 5-ONE LAST CIGARETTE-A TALE OF WRONG DOING THAT GETS A GUY THE CHAIR. ALL IN ALL THIS ALBUM IS NOT BAD, BUT COULD BE BETTER."
5,please listen to the music,"this is one of my favorite albums now. it's very solid, and the lyrics are very serious. the song with Tego calderon reveals the latino spirit in these guys. please listen to this cd, and judge later."
2,What's Your Number...,"I have not listened to this album, nor have I even heard the song ""what's your number"" but from reading the other reviews, I see that some people are confused about this song. Tim Armstrong worked on this song, which makes sense why it just doesn't seem like a song that they would have done. One person mentioned that it sounded like the Clash, and again, that's Tim's influence. He has been influenced by the Clash, and has brought alot of that to his own music. So you can see why this song would probably not be the typical cypress hill style song, and why it might have a Clash-like sound to it."
3,That's all I got to say.,"This CD includes two albums by John Schneider, which were the first two albums he recorded for MCA Records, after having little success with Scotti Brothers Records. Too Good to Stop Now had two #1 hit songs, while Tryin' to Outrun the Wind had two Top Ten songs. These are pretty decent 1980s style country albums."
2,"To many characters, Not enough pages .","I am a great fan of Ms. Johnston, and have read all the Hawk's way books more than once. This book had to many stories going on and you couldn't enjoy each the way you have all the other books in this series. It was like Jake , Hope, and Faith's storywere secondary to Jeb and Amanda. Seems like the stories were all jammed together to try and finish the series and move on to something else. The best thing about the book was the fact that you got to touch base with some much loved characters."
2,Not worth the money,I can't believe how bad this one is. Normally I really enjoy Joan Johnston's books but not this one. Don't waste your time or money here.
4,Ms Johnston is awesome,"I have read several of Ms Johnston's books and found that this was one of my favourites. I do wish that it had focused more on Jake and Hope but still enjoyed it. As for the age difference between the two main characters, I have no problem with that. Speaking from experience, this does happen in real life and I could follow along with the situation.We must remember that the novels that are written by Ms Johnston and other authors are fictional and meant to remove us from reality for the short bit of time it takes us to read them.Keep up the good work as I can't wait to enjoy more. I'm already looking to find all the other books from Hawk's Way."
1,Lose this book,"Plot description on this book's Amazon[.com] page. What a waste of time. This book could be twice its size and still be boring and uninteresting. The only likable couple was Faith and Randy. There is something about an 18 year old (21 in this story) stalking a 36 year man that turns me off. And that is what Hope was doing, stalking him. Jake is dense and rigid--he takes 3 years to decide to marry--waiting for his stalker to finish school--can anyone believe this stuff. It gets better; about halfway through the book, the author drops another sister (triplets) into the story. The reason she was given away at two-they couldn't afford her! Nothing about this book is worth anyone's time, effort or money. Stay away from it."
1,A Nice Fairy Tale,"My first Joan Johnston book and I hope this is not the best example of her stories. I found this preposterous. What a dumb story line. I agree totally with the other reviewers on the pitiful reason to give away one of triplets. If they couldn't afford all three, they should have adopted all three out to a family that could raise and love them without separating them.And to be able to pull off a triple wedding in one week, we all know that's not possible with full custom made gowns. Evidently the ""poor"" parents didn't have to pay for 3 weddings. I don't think I'm interested in reading any other of the Hawkes Way series."
2,Finish is misrepresented,"Ordered this to match other fixtures in a stainless steel/nickel room. Finish was chrome, not nickel. I don't know if the wrong fixture was sent or the finish was poorly labeled."
5,chrome hook,"I bought two of these hooks to use on the back of two bathroom doors. Hooks were as expected from a Kohler product...well made,nice polished finish and easy to install. No more wet towels on the floor!"
2,Underwater Blair Witch Project,"My husband and I love to snorkel and really wanted to like this - it is a decent ""home movie,"" and is about that interesting. There are some beautiful shots of beaches, a ""Waikiki Sunset,"" but overall, it was boring and a bit overpriced at $1.99. A book would be a better investment I'm sorry to say."
4,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","I was never a Jackie Chan fan,,,I always though of him as too commercial and mechanical. However, after viewing this flick in it's entirety, and with some reservations,,I was pleasantly surprized. I though the choreography and cinematography was well placed. I really enjoyed this movie,,as it was truly entertaining from the start to finish. I must admit,,after checking out this particular flick,,,I find myself profoundly sold, and would possibly entertain future Jackie Chan endeavours!!"
3,Jackie Chan and the big pile of mud,"Early Jackie Chan, some good kung-fu, not much plot, and what there is, is kind of confusing. oh you can follow it, but why bother? the dragon fight at the begining is quite good."
4,"old ""skool"" kung fu","I though this particular jackie Chan's flick was a little different from the rest, since his choreography/ comedy are usually the same. Simply, you see one Chan's flick, and you see them all. This one however was different, and interesting from the word ""GO""!!I though he performed beautifully,,and not the same old same old. The villain was equally impressive, with his amazing foot works. He captured the audience's attention from the moment he escapped incarceration, and was set free by his buddies,,definately a fight scene to be remembered!!!If you're a true Chan's fan, rest assured,,,you will not be dissapointed. Truly one of chan's best earlier flicks,,,,would make a great addittion to the collection!!"
4,Early Jackie Chan mastery,"One of Jackie Chan's earliest films, the Young Master is a great example of his burgeoning comedic and fighting talents. The story is of a student kicked out of his school and Jackie's quest to find him. Don't be put off by the old school quality of this film as it is paced fairly well unlike many films of this period. The fight with the fan, the lion dance at the beginning, and the final action sequence with Whang Inn-Sik are three highlights here. The DVD quality is okay, but the film quality is pretty poor due to its age and its storage in Hong Kong. A good triple feature viewed alongside Drunken Master and Fearless Hyena. Recommended."
3,Telling you how it is,"I watched this movie as a kid and loved it! Ten years later, it's a different story. Do not buy this movie if you expect a good quality dvd with good dubbing. Buy this Dvd if you expect some good-ol-fashioned kung-fu action. Also, my little bother (seven) loved it!"
2,The first and last 20 minutes..,"This is a fairly decent movie, but only if you've never seen any of Jackie's other brilliant works. The opening Lion Dance sequence is stellar, but the movie drags on and on until the very entertaining final fight. Yuen Biao fights wonderfully with the horse bench, and actually outshines Jackie in some areas. These are just some notes to consider..."
3,Not in English,"The DVD is not in English. If you want this movie dubbed in English you must get the VHS casette. It is a good movie otherwise, some of Jackie's best work. But I was dissapointed in having to watch the DVD in subtitles."
5,A TRUE CLASSIC,"This movie is one of the best martial arts films I've ever seen. It has amazing fights along with a very humorous story. It is balanced very nicely from beginning to end. The fight where the criminal is broken from his restraints and beats up the guards is awe-inspiring, and the final fight is extremely entertaining. A very, very entertaining film."
5,works well,Have Spaun drums and the Optimount was easy to install. Use the smaller size so it attaches to the metal portion of the screws and not the rim of your drum. Easy adjustments once installed but you gota remove top and bottom head
2,doesn't look like the picture,"I tried and tried to make it look nice and ... no, it doesn't work, look like the one in the picture at all.. it is just less than ok."
3,OK for my purpose,"I purchased this wig for a show I am in and for that purpose, as it will be seen from the stage, it will be OK. Up close it is a bit cheap looking and frizzy but overall it will be fine for my needs."
5,A real life answer,"This trouble in their relationship is not solved by something mystical, but by understanding their own faults and each taking responsibility and beginning a change. I love it!"
5,Master Political Scientist Provides Timely Update,"The first edition of The Politics of Medicare, reprinted in part for the second edition, provides an engaging analytical structure for understanding the complex forces of governments and politics. While studying under the author, a gifted political scientist, years ago, the first edition was a cornerstone in our studies of healthcare politics and programs in the United States. The book equips the reader with the tools and knowledge to understand political forces well beyond the Medicare program.The analysis of Medicare in the 1990s, found in the current volume, is excellent. This is an ideal time to read or reread the book since Medicare program changes will face our new President and the newly elected or reelected members of our House of Representatives and Senate during 2001. This fall I read the second edition and found the book very informative and enjoyable."
1,Get what you pay for,"We put these in our house as we are allergy sufferers. We did not get any better. After a month of no results, we switched them out with the 3M Filtrete 1900 MPR filters. It made a huge difference in one day."
3,good idea - strange writing,"After reading the book I had mixed feelings. I read it fast - there was suspense. But then, Jeremy travels through the USA, his behavior inexplicable and without motivation. His grief does not explain it. And he behaves in a completely unnatural way that is not psychologically explained at all. Jeremey's chaos math seems to have entered Simmons' brain while he was writing the novel. I liked ""Song of Kali"" a lot better."
3,THE HOLLOW BOOK...,"This book has its moments. Unfortunately, those moments are often few and far between. The book starts off promisingly enough. A man, gifted or cursed, depending on one's point of view, with the ability to read minds, loses his soul mate to cancer. She, too, was blessed or cursed with the same gift.Now, set adrift and left his own devices, the agony his ability brings him, coupled with his soul mate's death, causes this man to promptly go to hell in a hand basket. Hoping to find solace of some kind, he travels and finds himself in some pretty unusual situations.Some of what he encounters strains credulity but some of it is quite interesting, especially for fans of true horror. Then, the book goes of the deep end, into some new age, mathematical mumbo jumbo, causing the story to lose steam and fall flat. Fans of the author will derive a modicum of enjoyment from the book, but this is definitely not one of the author's best efforts."
3,Interesting take on Human consciousness,"Not my favorite novel by Dan Simmons, but still an interesting read.At times, I had difficulty wrapping MY Human consciousness around Simmons'explanations of the nature of consciousness. This is pretty heavy stuff for fiction!But if you can get past that, there is a good story here about love and sharing everything with your mate."
2,Not what you expect from Dan Simmons,If you are coming off the amazing Hyperion series to read another Simmons book -- skip this one. I could have put it down at any time and wish I had. Without giving away anything: about 15% of the book is a pointless subplot of a horror / drama that is totally unnecessary.
2,Disappointing...,"This could have been a really neat sci/fi story about telepathy. Instead, Mr. Simmons feels the need to try to ""prove"" the validity of his mystic mathematical pseudo-religious view of the (parallel) universe(s). All the quantum physics mumbo-jumbo didn't add to the story, and didn't convince me of anything.I also thought that it was quite silly to close this at times shocking and gruesome novel with a ""happily-ever-after"" ending that didn't seem to fit."
2,Mediocre for Dan Simmons,"First off, I am a huge fan of Dan Simmons, but I felt that 'The Hollow Man' fell far below his usual standards in storytelling and writing. Although it begins and initially proceeds well, towards the end it becomes confused and it seems that Mr. Simmons doesn't really know how to end the story and resolve all the questions it ultimately poses. I'd recommend skipping this novel altogether and reading his other excellent novels, especially the Hyperion series."
1,Unfortunate,"I really like Dan Simmons, unfortunately this book is truly awful. The characters, the writing and the story were all well below par for this talented writer. The characters, in particular were so ""hollow"" I was rooting for bad things to happen to them, and that's not a good feeling.If this was the first book I read from Dan Simmons it would also be the last. He seemed to be forcing the story forward simply to complete the book. Perhaps he had a publishing deadline.Anyway, don't give up on Dan Simmons he is typically a very competent writer with great ideas and a novel view of the world."
2,Too painful to read,"After reading ""Hyperion"" I eagerly bought ""The hollow man"". It was a dissapointment. Too grim, depressing, the quantum physics part does not make sense and is too repetitious and the horror element is the worse aspect. Even Simmons admitted in a interview that writing this book was his most painful one."
2,"Hollow Man, hollow book!!","As a Dan Simmons fan, it pains me to have to trash this book, but a trashing is more than called for. Simmons has a great idea but squanders it on a story that goes nowhere -- the plot randomly wanders around and then suddenly stops. The bulk of the story seems to be filler composed of bits and pieces of short story ideas (e.g. the Miz Morgan incident) whose sole purpose is to provide an excuse for the main character to arrive at the final section. I also have to ask how many more times Simmons intends to recycle the ""old Jewish guy"" character! The book is not a complete disaster since it does have imaginative ideas and -- if judged individually -- some well-written sections, but overall is still not worth reading.I'm left wondering if Simmons is on the same downward spiral that Arthur C. Clarke, Orson Scott Card, and William Gibson seem to be taking."
4,reinforces what a creative genius Simmons is,"This book grabbed me by the eyeballs - like the best of S.King/R. Bachman - and didn't let go until the very end. A wild ride - thought provoking and well-conceptualized throughout. An on-the-road type book, the protaganist travels from Philly to Disneyworld to the deserts to Las Vegas to... and deals with lots of intense violence and good sickening horror. And reminisces about l-o-v-e on the way to stir the reader in a different way. I liked the Hyperion series a lot - Hollow Man was easier to read (maybe because it is earthbound?) and I liked it just as much (if not better). Only disappointment (which some may like a lot), too much math and physics. Otherwise great stuff."
2,disappointing and disjointed,"I bought this because Hyperion was excellent and was very disappointed. I couldn't identify with the characters, the narrative jumped about too much, the science didn't interest me, the plot didn't interest me and I'm glad I picked it up second hand rather than paying full price!"
2,Dan Simmons phones it in,"I loved Carrion Comfort, and feel that the Hyperion books are among the best science fiction I've read. That said, this book was a thorough disappointment. Midway through I kept thinking he must have had a contractual obligation with a publisher to come up with a manuscript, because this novel was just a pretty good short story inflated to a few hundred pages"
2,Dan's Bomb,"I enjoyed the Hyperion series. Children of the Night was OK, but with Hollow Man, Dan Simmons has bombed out. This book should not have passed editorial muster: the ""plot"" is incinsistent and never clear; the ""science"" fiction never comes alive; events do not follow logically, nor do they build upon themselves; even the chapter titles do not relate to the book. I found this a tough, disappointing read, and the final page and ""plot"" resolution, topped off the experience. If written by a no-name author, this book would never have been published (and should not have been)."
1,The worst of Simmons work I've read,"I was really surprised to see good reviews for this book. I bought it because I really loved other books I've read by Simmons - and was very let down. If you are looking for a story like Hyperion, skip this book. I can appreciate that others liked the romance/mystery/whatever aspect of this book. To me the weakness is the writing and the foggy plot made it hard to appreciate whatever inherent qualities the story was intended to have."
2,Very disappointing.,"After devouring the Hyperion series and loving it, The Hollow Man was set up for high expectations. Even without those expectations, I believe that I would have been extremely disappointed in The Hollow Man.The book gets hung up on meaningless mathematics. For such an intelligent person, the main character acts like a idiot. While some might argue the emotions that are driving his behavior, I find it a hard leap.Overall, very disappointing, and I probably won't pick up another Dan Simmons book unless someone convinces me otherwise."
1,This can't be the same Dan Simmons,"Terrible. Just Terrible. This is the first time in years I wanted to put down a book before I finished it. In fact, I wanted to invent a time machine just so I could tell myself not to pick it up.The Hyperion series was excellent and for this reason I picked up ""The Hollow Man."" This book completely lacks fresh concepts. The KIRKUS REVIEW is actually pretty accurrate when they say the author leaps but doesn't land anywhere.The book gets caught up in ideas based on made up mathematical equasions, concepts too ill defined to really sink your teeth into and a plot which could have been told in a thirty page short story. Simmons keeps moving between current time and flashbacks in a pointless way and never finds a sense of direction (much like the movements of his protagonist). On top of all this, there are no (repeat NO) new ideas here at all.I'm sorry I bothered with it. I'd have been better off rereading the New York Times from three weeks ago."
4,Great conversation piece,Found this at a flea market for $30. Obviously this unit isn't about high-end audio fidelity... it's a neat visual edition to a living or games room.Only downside for me is that almost all of the mini bulbs have burned out in the front panel. Opening the unit revealed that they're not easily-replaceable xmas tree lights.... these puppies are hard-wired in.
5,Firm Cardio was not what I expected,The only reason why I purchased this tape was to achieve the best results by combining the cardio with the strength video. I was expecting a bunch of prancing around. That is not what this tape was about. It's tough and it really works the glutes well. I actually like it better than the strength one. I would recommend this video with the strength video. They both are very good and the best part is that they do work different parts of the body very well.
2,the worst video of an amazing series,"first off, I just want to say I am passioante about the firm workout series. The changes in my body over the past few years have been amazing, and every summer I can don a bathing suit with confidence - This video, however, is the farthest thing from a cardio workout. The step routines are boring and barely raise my heart rate, and the instructor is really annoying, The majority of the video is spent blasting lower body muscles with weight work - but even this is not done as aggressively as in other videos. If you're looking for cardio, i would reccomend any of the other firm videos. The workouts are intense and the results are dramatic and fast. This is just the one bad apple."
2,Not that good.,"I own 4 Firm video tapes and rate their top at 5 stars. This tape however, really is not that good. Very confusing transition between exercises that make it difficult to enjoy the workout. It is frustrating to keep up with the frequent changes. Again, not thier best."
1,Ishtar was a better movie...,"Predictable, bad writing, bad acting and stupid all rolled into one.Sadly and embarassingly, I picked this flick up because I liked this past season's Thursday night mindlessness of ""Good Morning Miami"" with Mark Fuerstein. This 90 minute monstrosity was no Good Morning Miami."
3,Thomas Kendall,early days of Australia has always fasinated me and I had great expectations that this was a good yarn. Unfortunately for me it tried to cover too long a period of Australian history. I had hoped a more detailed life of Thomas Kenadall and the trials and tribulations of living in a penal colony.For me the book could have been the start of the Kindall dynasty covering the generations over 3 books. Tended to lose the plot as too much was attempted with the one book.
5,GREAT CD!,This CD is really great! It can lift up any christian's spirit at any time. This CD is awesome!
1,dont bother,Dont waste your money or your time on this one.More of a paper than a book. You skim through it in ten minutes and learn almost nothing
4,a message from the past about the wave of the future,"who is Adam?this book will give you some clues . . .It's the auto-biographical story of the awakening of a ""one-armed sailor"" named Will Maney, under the universal guidance of Adam, who speaks through letters delivered by co-author Lynda Friedman.Will, as everyman will, remembers a lifetime of running from, and toward, his past. And remembering the past reveals the destiny hidden within."
5,Profound Insight and Hope,"I've a long ""to do"" list. A lot of my energy and time have been spent on the tasks involved in striking an item off the list. ""Read that book"" was added to my list one afternoon when some friends had gathered to meet Will. While my ""to do"" list and the compulsive focus on the tasks have not completely disappeared since I've read (and re-read and re-read) the book, something much more significant has transpired. A window to my soul has been opened. The Truth passed from Adam to Linda to Will is, for me, the collective wisdom of all prophets and sages gone before. The letters are from a source of Light and Love. The letters, this book, is a most significant work in our world's understanding of things transcendent. Given all that is before us now, as a country, as members of a world community, these letters offer insight, peace of mind and hope."
5,Heaviest CCM album I'll ever own!,"I'm a metal-head, so Cindy Morgan's The Loving Kind kinda sticks out in my music collection. It's not the kind of music I'd usually consider listening to. That in itself is reason to get this! It's heavy as all get-out....without trying to be. It will floor you in a way chugging guitar riffs and double-bass drums never could! I would have given it more than 5 stars if an option. It's a classic that surpasses any musical genre. Get it...now!"
3,The lyrics are beautiful!,"I like Cindy Morgan a lot, but sometimes she has a habit of drowning out her voice with the piano, guitars, or drums. So, musically I did not really like this CD (I did like however, The Loving Kind, Take my Life, and Praise the King). However, the lyrics are absolutely wonderful as she accounts the last days of Jesus Christ's life. If you listen to this CD, you should also read the book by her husband, Sigmund Brouwer called ""The Weeping Chamber""."
1,jeep key chain,"I never received this item from the seller. It was allegedly delivered to my home over one month ago, although I never received it. After numerous e-mails, the company still will not refund my money. I will not purchase from them ever again."
1,3 times and counting,"Waterman Expert Black Laquer .5mm Pencil - 30021WI am about to return this pencil for the 3rd repair. Each time it is returned it works until the lead needs to be refilled. Then it will not advance. The company will not replace the $125 pencil nor refund the price. They concede there is a ""faulty mechanism"" which they ""supposedly repair"". This pencil was part of a three piece set. Both pens work with the excellence expected of Waterman products. I continue to add to the cost of the unusable Waterman Expert pencil with insured return postage while using a $1.25 Pentel pencil. It is now a matter of principle (or stupidity)."
2,Odd,"The thing I liked best about these reading glasses is the quality of the lens.The thing I liked least about these reading glasses is:difficult to handle around my neck; they felt awkward;had trouble trying to put them on or take them off with one hand; at least with glasses on a rope I can do the one-hand put on or take off;not easy to carry with me; no case to put them in and the don't fit in my purse to take along; maybe if they folded up somehow.These glasses are not for me but they might work for others. Not a bad product, just not what I need."
4,I'll wear these as long as I can get them,"I'm just crazy about these glasses. They are comfortable, fashionable and the talk of the town. What I like best is the plastic ""holder"" stays in place when not in use, even when I'm riding my scooter around town. Kudos to the inventor of this little gem!"
1,Waste of good money,"These glasses do not work. not only do they look cheap (worst of plastic ever!) they do not fit anyone properly!! and the lenses are even worst! they fog up so easily, scratch even with tissue and none of the four i bought have the right prescribed reading grade. save your money - not even worth a penny."""
2,Glasses too large,I think the glasses are too heavy. I also don't like the fact that they do not collapse and fit into a standard glasses case. There is no practical way too store them when not wearing them.
3,Click It glasses,Glasses where what I wanted but they where to small for my head. Do they come in a larger size.
2,"Too small,one size does not fit all","The idea is great, but they are way to small even for the average size persons head. Hopefully they will read this and make the strap adjustable. Clics would sell millions more if the do."
2,Snug fit,"While this is a very good idea and I was going to have them fitted with my working lenses, my head measures 22 1/2 inches at the bridge of the nose and the fit is too tight for comfort."
4,"Get ready for ""Where did you get those glasses!""","CliC glasses are well made, comfortable, and convenient. The lenses are a little small but the convenience of having them always around my neck and secure (rather than a regular pair of glasses on my head that fall off when bending over) makes CliCs very practical. Only downside might be the looks and questions you get from people who have never seen them before."
2,"Mica phones it in...sad, really","I love Mica Paris and have ALL her CDs, but this desperate attempt to scoring a baby-boomer MOR crossover hit in the U.S. is just lame - pedestrian cover choices, flat arrangements, and then, of course, there's Mica herself, barely working up a sweat as she literally seems to merely phone it in - her vocals are the most limp, lackluster of her long career - dig deep back to 80s/90s soul hits like MY ONE TEMPTATION or I WANNA HOLD ONTO YOU and see how blander Mica has become - is this her label or the artist herself? Either way, this won't please longtime fans - I suggest Mica get her old label Island/4th&Broadway to reissue her rare remixes & Bsides on CD - especially the long-lost BRUCE FORREST U.S. DANCE MIX of her debut smash MY ONE TEMPTATION - now that's searing, soulful Mica in her prime!"
3,"President's weakest album yet, but like none other","While I love the Presidents for the sole fact that they are (were) unlike any band, some of their weaknesses seem evident on Pure Frosting. The best tunes are the new (or previously unreleased tracks) like upbeat ""Japan"" or ""Teenage Girl"". The self depreciating live songs are a nice touch... in ""Back Porch"" it sounds like a fan yells ""Just shut up and play Peaches!"", although that could just be me. Yet the album as a whole just doesn't have the completeness of II or even their self titled debut. Fans should give it a try, but don't go out and buy it just for their version of ""Video Killed the Radiostar."" They have so many better songs, just too bad there won't be any more."
4,a fun album for the whole family,"A few great songs are on the album like ""cleveland rocks"", and ""video killed the radio star"" are on this cd, but trash thrown in like ""tiki lounge god"" and live versions of two previous songs take away from the overall quality of the album. For big PUSA fans only."
3,Presdients need more new songs,This cd has some pretty kwel songs but some r just live crap from previos cd's. Clevend Rocks is a must 4 the Drew Carey Fan like myself. The cd should have been released after the Presidents had some more new songs-Brett Bylsma
5,Extremely Sweet,"I highly disagree with the few reviews on this page. There are absolutely ZERO low points on this album. I suppose that Slip Away could be considered a low point when put in perspective, if Teenage Girl is %1,000 awesome, then Slip Away is only %457 awesome, but they're both way more than awesome. I'd also like to say to the people who say that PUSA has never done anything like Tremelo Blooz: What about Back Porch and, to a lesser extent, Froggy? However, I do agree that this is a must have for any PUSA fan. Even if you're not a PUSA fan, buy this album and the other four and become a fan of one of the greatest bands ever."
4,Its Grand,"I'm a big POTUSA fan and i didn'y like what i heard to start with other than Video killed the radio star, but once it hit back porch the rest of the album is great, with the exception of tremelo blues. It's a bit country for me, however i give it a big 4 out of 5."
4,A great little rocker of a cd,I am a real fan of the PUSA . This is an excellent cd and a real shame the group broke up. Definetly one little rocker for your cd collection
4,So far so good.,"On carpet, this product is wonderful. Great suction and pickup. Quite impressed by how quiet it is.Shortfalls are:The attachments reach is very poor. Trying to reach more than 3 feet away from the vacuum will tip it over... most likely onto you.On tile, the vacuum just flings dirt around because you cannot turn off the brush.The touchless dump feature is not always touchless. You may need to reach your hand into the container and remove the pet hair from the filter."
4,I wish I'd shopped around first!,"As soon as I purchased this, for some reason I decided to check the manufacture's website, I think just to check on the availability of the filters. Once there I found this same vacuum for $10.00 cheaper! So heads up on that. As for the vacuum itself, I like it, it seems to work well. The onboard tools are slightly non-user friendly, and the hose could be a little longer. But suction is great, it does a great job at what it was designed to do, is easy to empty. I have 3 black cats, and didn't realize how much cat hair I had all over the place until I vacuumed with this unit."
3,Only good on carpeting,"This vacuum is excellent on carpet and terrible on bare floors. Since my home has mostly bare floors I wish I had bought something else. The only way to make it work on Hardwoods, tile, etc. is to put it on the second lowest setting and it still throws stuff around the room. Any setting higher and you create a dirt and dust storm. On the lowest setting the roller sounds like it is going to dig a hole through the floor. On the other hand it does a pretty amazing job pulling stuff out of carpet. The foot release is also cheap and I wouldn't be surprized if it brakes soon. I give it 1 star for bare floors and 5 stars for wall to wall carpeting."
2,"It sucks because it doesn't ""suck""","I did my homework, read reviews and decided to not spend a lot of money for a vacuum for my boutique that is carpet squares and wood floors. Since we are a boutique there are threads and beads on the floor all the time. We had to pass over them several times for the vacuum to pick them up if it did at all. The revolving brush attachment was nice and handy for small areas and did work nicely but that was all that worked. My husband insisted on buying a Dyson for the shop because we owned one at home but I wanted to save the money. Turns out he was right. I returned the Dirt Devil and bought the yellow Dyson and it's wonderful!"
4,we had a SLIGHT problem assembling it but once we did....WOAH!!,Unbelievable the difference a great vacuum cleaner makes. An old house with OLD carpet looks quite like new & a JOY to vacuum now instead of the DREAD because we know its not REALLY going to be clean after we finish. We had a minor fight to get the handle in the hole but once we did...Its like WOAH man!!! Very light easily maneuverable & a joy to look at!!
4,A good book with it's own opinions,"This book focuses almost exclusively on the foal. Dr. Lose has written another book, Blessed are the Brood mares, to cover the mare half of foaling. I enjoyed this book, but found it a bit spare on the actually foaling procedure. It extensively covers diseases and illnesses ... something that occurs, but not to all of us. I would have preferred more time spent on how to keep the foal healthy and happy. I'll call the vets over if my foal gets sick and I'll trust their opinion the best. Dr. Lose covers a long length of time in the foal's life, examining vaccinations during the first year, handling the foal (limited), turning the mare and foal out (some good tips there), and feeds. She is an advocate of early weaning of the foal at 3 months of age. This is a debatable practice, but if you are interested in it, she seems to have her reasoning explained."
3,GREAT BOOK!!,"BOOK IS WONDERFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW IN THE FOALING ASPECT OF OWNING HORSES.... VERY INFORMATIVE. IF YOU HAVE BABIES, YOU SHOULD OWN THIS BOOK"
3,Nice little compass,I bought this compass on a keychain to hang on my back pack for a trip. Worked fine and the temperature gauge was useful too. Good compass for the price.
4,"It may be old, but Walken makes it new.","Mind Snatchers is a decent movie.This will be completely spoiler free.Basically, Walken plays a really mean and angry person who is taken to a hospital for others with mental issues. He's diagnosed with some sort of condition unto which he is so aggressive. But, given he's such an angry man, he begins to prod into the hospital's background. He makes certain alliances, certain people help him, they even compromise with him, but his tenacious demeanor gets him deeper into our plot.Overall, there's some good suspense and nail biting moments when you're holding back from screaming 'COME ON, CHRIS!' but mind you this is an old film. If you can't look past the mediocre cinematography, sound feedback and a bit of cheesy supporting acting- don't watch. But, if your view is open to such, enjoy the film."
