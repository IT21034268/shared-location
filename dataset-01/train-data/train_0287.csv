2,Sucks as no 2 player LAN games possible,"I bought this game for me and my wife to play, only to find out after installing it that LAN play requires THREE players minimum. The cover and documentation says ""UP TO 8 PLAYERS LAN"", and FAILS to mention this little drawback. Not to mention the screenshot in the LAN setup instructions have a picture of the single player screen, so it LOOKS like if you can add computer players too. Very misleading. I had to go their support website to confirm 2 player LAN is not supported. VERY DISAPPOINTED. DON'T BUY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY 2 PLAYERS."
3,Worth trying Same-time Risk,"Risk 2 offers a tournament play with increasing difficult predefined maps and objectives, classic and same-time risk with about a dozen different computer opponents.The innovation in this game is the same-time. This is an extremely fun option, and greatly speeds the gameplay with friends, since everyone does their turn at the same time, and then sit back and watch the action.The only technical problem with this game is it requires a minimum of three players, and computer opponents are not offered for networked games. Computer opponents are available for ""hot-seat"" games where players share one computer. Otherwise a solid title."
2,"Okay, but gets old quickly","This game would be FAR better if the campaign mode weren't the same every time through, or if you didn't have to start at the beginning every time you lose a single battle (playing the same early levels over and over gets REALLY old). It might be worth $10, but don't expect it to be one of your new favorites. I probably wouldn't play it at all if I weren't a huge Risk fan."
2,"Classic game, yet very questionable AI.","Like all great classic games, Risk is challenging and addictive. But even though this game comes with an excellent graphics and many customizable elements, its AI is extremeley questionable. I've played countless games where the computer rolls 4's or higher 70% of the time, while my 4's or higher barely reach even 40%. I've also seen the computer conquer territories with an army half its size and only two or three losses (the AI just conquered my entire continent of South America, which I had garrisoned with 21 battalions, with an army of 12 and only two losses). These bots seem to have no notable skills other than cheating on their rolls. If it weren't for the questionable dice, any intermediate player could probably win the default classic match almost all of the time."
3,"Important Book, Improbable Claims","This book had a big impact, but it shouldn't have. It might be summarized: a bunch of learned people made a bunch of improbable claims, ignoring any evidence that stands in their way. Muddied the waters greatly.To summarize its contents further: nonsense, nonsense, Tom Cable, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, John C. Pope, nonsense, nonsense."
5,Words are pointless... just listen,If you haven't listened to this you haven't livedSo listen to it and prepare to be astounded
5,"Thanks for the beautiful music, Jason.","There will always be those kind of people like Jason, SRV, Charlie Christian, Jaco Pastorius or Jimi Hendrix who remind us of our full potential.Each one of them were like meteors,scorching through life, producing the brightest light and then burning out for what ever reason.Jason Becker was one of the brightest stars of all..."
5,Shred or Dead,"Virtuosity. To sum this album up in one word. This is composing at its best proving once more that Jason Becker isn't a guitarist, he's a Musician. This is an absolout MUST have for any fan of guitar driven music like shred for example. Forget Yngwie, forget Gilbert, forget Ziras. This is Jason Becker. Difficult to pick out high-lights in such an amazing album, but the song ""Perpetual Burn"" stands out for me. Harmonies so fantastic, Bach would roll in his grave. Even Becker's old pal Marty stops by to play with him on a few of the tracks such as ""Dweller in the Cellar"". This is an instrumental CD setting the standard for guitarists all over. I took years trackin this CD down, and here's amazon offering it you for, what will be, the best pennies you have ever spent."
5,one of a kind composer....,"jason becker was one of he elite 80,s guitarists,that was too release instrumentals in that decade.this album is loved by everyone who loves shred music,and is up there with MALMSTEENS rising force and MACALPINES maximum security for the best of the 80,s.theres alot of debate on the reviews about yngwie and jason and whos better,well who cares ,personally i like malmsteen better and rising force is, i believe better than this album,its just black star ,far beyond the sun ,evil eye and the emotional icarus dream suite op4 cant be beaten for pure neo-classical.everyone says yngwie plays with no emotion ,listen too icarus dream suite ,ad u,ll be proven wrong.anyway onto this album jason wrote some fantastic compositions for this album, altitudes an air ,especially.he has speed ,he has melody, well he has everything and its a fantastic album overall ,but there is better out thereanyway BUY IT."
5,One of the top neo-classical guitar albums of the 80's,"This album is awesome. Jason Becker's guitar flows from relaxed to sprint fret work throughout. The track 'Perputual Burn' is my favourite. But all the tracks are good. The track 'Air' is a delightful track to listen to even for the non-guitarists out there. Sharpnel records certainly introduced us to a lot of Guitarists. But only a few stuck out for, Ritchie Kotzen, Paul Gilbert and this guy, Jason Becker. If you are into decently composed neo-classical guitar compositions this album will be right up your street. Jason's contribution is certainly some of the best from the genre."
5,"If you play electric guitar, this will inspire you!",Perpetual Burn: a man with seemingly no technical limitations playing exactly what he wants on electric guitar. Jason Becker makes extremely difficult passages sound easy because they're all over the place! The music is beautiful and interesting: definitely worth it for the guitar lover. I can't get over how awesome the title piece is...
4,Ahem,"Some of the other reviewers need to calm themselves down. No, it's not impossible for other people to play Becker's stuff. I know plenty guitarists who can do it. It's also not that impressive that Becker was 18 when he released this CD. I know guitarists that young that have his ability well matched. It's a great guitar album, sure, but it's not the greatest of the great."
3,Musical ...,Although extremely technically gifted Jason Becker demonstrates a lack of creativity. Becker plays with such limited feeling it is almost as though a computer is fretting his notes. If you're into technically mind-blowing shred with no real thought or emotion behind it this album's for you.
5,A great book,A great book if you're looking for a chance to explore another level of Umbral learning.
4,We all have beliefs,"So that we can approach the effects of beliefs - particularly religious or spiritual ones - on people, it is necessary to acknowledge what science and technology can do and what it can't. Our technology can only measure and record empirical data as we observe from the outside as objectively as possible. Beliefs come from the mind whereas scientifically we are observing the brain, so science doesn't 'prove' or 'disprove' anything in this regard as it is personal and ultimately subjective - not external or material.This book was very insightful. There is, however, a bias towards thinking that we can be 'hardwired' to certain beliefs and this is a nature vs nurture argument. As we have free will, we do not have to be victims of circumstance although we can be predisposed towards, say, mental and physical illness or be encouraged towards either in our environment. If we use such bias, in the extreme it can be used to support negative eugenics."
4,A Dream of a Book,"I quite enjoyed Poet and Dancer, as Jhabvala completely immersed me in the world of the protagonist and antagonist. The characters were rich and life-like, but still held an ethereal mystique for me. In particular, Jhabvala's language jolted my senses. Her prose swings its way into the most beautiful poetry. The imagery within the story was covered in a deep mist, but as a reader I wanted that mist there to distance me from the at times difficult scenarios the characters found themselves in.Be prepared for a heartbreak of an ending that will drag to you read another Jhabvala's.If you like this book, I HIGHLY recommend ""When FOX is a Thousand"" by Larissa Lai."
3,The gold balls are hollow & the screw-on backs are tiny,"These gold round balls are hollow & the screw-on backs so tiny that it's difficult to screw them on to the earring posts. As I prefer a ""brushed"" finish, my husband used very fine steel wool to achieve this look. One earring's hollow ball indented in the process but it wasn't visible when wearing it. As these earrings are so difficult to put on, I was reluctant to remove them. After a relatively short time one of the tiny screw-on backs came off at home and I never found it. The earrings are so light-weight that it would take at least 20 pairs to achieve the minimum pennyweight to sell them as scrap gold."
4,Very Pretty,Got exactly what I expected! Perfect to wear in uniform. Item is sturdier than the previous pair I used to wear (which dented somehow while in my ear?) These look great.
5,amazing bottle,"If anyone has a baby that spits up, you have to get this bottle. My son is 4 months old now and at about 4 weeks old we found out that he has acid reflux and the flap in his stomach doesn't close, so we have to thicken his milk with cereal and sit him up for an hour after he eats. we started out with the playtex nurser bottles to reduce the intake of air, because the more he has to burp the more he spits up because of the stomach problem. I just found the Dr. browns bottles about a week ago and the change it has made is just amazing, he doesn't spit up anything like he did before, so i couldn't imagine how it would be with a baby that didn't have his problem. i used to change his clothes about 7 or 8 times a day and now it's about 2 times.He also takes either the wide neck or regular, he doesn't seem to care which one i feed him from. But if you have a spitty baby you have to get these bottles, they are a must."
4,The Best Bottle of All !!!,"My son used to wake up crying in between his every nap because of gas pain, and spit up after every feeding. I have tried the avent bottle. It didn't solve the problem until I tried the wide neck Dr. Brown bottle. My son doesn't spit up or wake up crying any more. Like the all other reviwers said, it is a pain to clean but it is worth it! BE AWARE: The narrow neck Dr. brown bottle could still cause gas problem because the nipple is so small that a baby can suck in some air while feeding. (My son did have gas problem when I used the narrow neck botlle)"
4,WORTH THE MONEY?,"My son is three months old and while I nurse him most of the time, I also give him bottles. I have tried every bottle out there...just like the other reviewers. This is the only bottle I've found that reduces HOW MUCH he spits up. HAVING SAID THAT, I don't know if it's because of these bottles or because his digestive system is getting more mature, but he doesn't seem to spit up as much. He STILL spits up though. So, I think if you want to try a bottle that reduces your baby from swallowing too much air, this would be the one. WARNING: they are a pain to clean because there's so much to them."
3,LEAKY BOTTLES!!!,"I found these bottles on the site when I was searching for something for my newborn. I saw that these bottles got a 4-4.5 star rating out of over 100 people. The only thing I heard was that they are hard to clean. I am not having a problem cleaning them, it is simple as long as you don't let the milk sit in the bottle. The hard part is that THEY LEAK!!! I have the 8oz and the 4oz bottles. I only make 3oz bottles so I know it is not because I overfilled them. If you warm the bottle up in warm water (which is what I need to do since it is breast milk), the milk rises into the reservoir and leaks!!! I tried to warm it in the portable baby warmer and it did the same there. Beware when you try to uncover it, it will spill!!! You have to loosen the bottle top before warming or else there will be a mess! Otherwise, I love the bottles, they work great for the gas etc."
4,Great bottle,"This is the only bottle we use. It does reduce gassiness/colic in our baby. They are expensive, but worth it. Dishwasher safe which is great. I highly recommend!"
5,Great for Reflux Babies,"My baby has reflux. It has been an uphill battle finding formula and medication to help control her problem. These bottles are a great addition to the arsenal combating the problem. They don't add to the overload on her poor tummy by by allowing excess air in. I've experimented with Playtex nursers, Avent nursers, and regular bottles trying to find something that would help and not add to the problem. After an unfortunate incident wherein I managed to pop the bag in the Playtex nurser while attempting to release excess air, the baby managing to collapse the nipple on the Avent, and a terrible vomiting episode after using the regular bottles, Dr. Brown's have been a God Send."
3,Great concept but they leaked!,"I was very excited about these bottles but became very frustrated when they started to leak around the rim. Even following all the instructions(which it was another thing I didn't like, they are high maintanance bottles)they still leaked and I gave it up."
5,A Blessing for this Mom,"I have a 10 month old son who has several medical problems, including stomach problems. I bought these bottles at the reccomendation of his gastroenterologist(stomach Dr) and have been mommy to a lil guy who is no longer in severe pain due to gas after every feeding. They are convenient for travel as well. Save your money on the rest of the bottles out there and go right for what works."
4,"Didn't want to buy becuase of extra parts, but it's GREAT!","I'm a twin mommy who is now on her THIRD brand of bottles. My boys have a lot of gas, acid reflux, and severe spit-up. They also get fussy during a feeding - except when I use the Dr. Brown's bottles. I started with Playtex nursers, then Avent, and I finally gave in and bought these. I wouldn't buy them originally because of the extra parts to wash but it really takes NO TIME to do (and I'm a multiple Mom and say this with confidence). My advice to new Moms is to ignore what you think are ""negatives"" about bottles (i.e. extra parts to wash), buy a couple of different kinds in the beginning, and find out what helps your baby(ies) the best!!!"
1,Way overated!,"My baby was having terrible gas problems so I after trying Avent and Playtex, I decided to give Dr. Browns a try. I saw no improvement in the gas problems my baby had, in fact, I can't stand these bottles now!!! They are the BIGGEST hassle to travel with (you can't clean them well without extra cleaning devices), the leak like crazy, and they are basically confusing for babysitters/family members who watch the baby. Unfortunately, I bought 12 of them and I regret it terribly - they are a waste of money and time (they take much longer to clean). I've read the other reviews and it's strange that there are so many positive reviews because I personally know at least 8-10 other mothers who also cannot stand them for the same reasons I mentioned. Another problem is that the replacement pieces come in 3 packs but one generally doesn't misplace 3 of an item?!! Take a pass and save your money!!! Stick with Avent!!"
2,Leaky Bottles,"We purchased the Dr. Brown's bottles for my son & I had a lot of trouble with them because they leak! When feeding him we would have to wrap a cloth around the bottle because of the leaking. Eventually, after paying a lot of money for the bottles, we ended up switching, now we are so happy that we have. I would not recommend these bottles to anybody!"
2,No real difference,"We bought thse bottles thinking, as everyone else did, that they would help the spit up and the gas. Our other two kids used Avent with no problems. This little guy has reflux, so we were looking for anything that would help. After 2 mths of use they started to leak and were always a pain to clean. We switched to the Platex nurser and have seen less spit up and less gas then when he was on the Dr. Brown's. Conclusion... I don't think the high tech bottle makes a bit of difference. It is a matter of what works for each individual baby."
1,Waste of Money!,"My son spits up a lot more with these bottles!! I read all of the reviews and people seemed to think these bottles were great, but we have had a bad experience. I didn't even mind spending the extra time cleaning the bottle, but my son began spitting up after every feeding! We are now using Playtex nursers with great results!! No spitting up and no bottle leakage!"
2,Too many pieces,"I am a mother of twins and one of them has reflux. Since we have to put cereal in her bottle and cut the nipples, using a cheap bottle does the trick for us. When you have to make double the bottles, putting together all of the pieces to these bottles takes up way too much time."
1,not worth the money,"the bottles were expensive, hard to clean, and leaked. They made my daughter spit up twice as bad as she did with any other bottle, and i tried alot of them. If i had it to do again I would buy the avent bottles and nothing else."
3,wide necks leak,"Breastfeeding and bottle feeding - We have been using these wide neck bottles from birth - figured the nipple would be better for him to adjust to but now that my son is 7 months old he likes to hold the bottle and feel the nipple when he drinks, but when he squeezes the nipple (or chews on it from teething) the formula comes up thru the straw-like vent and leaks out the sides. EXTREEMLY frustrating. Unfortunately we have a small ""investment"" in a bundle of these bottles, wish I could find a solution. I dont mind the extra pieces to wash, and the science of the bottle seems to be a great idea. At this point I wrap a towel around it and end up wasting most of the formula."
3,Difficult for Handwashing and Travelling,"Although our baby feeds well from these, there are a few major downfalls:*They are too big for the average insulated travel packs, (height & width)*Second, they are awkward for most bottle drying racks-- because of their unique shape and all the little parts-- not to mention it's a pain to wash them in the first place because of all the little pieces*The nipples are slightly too tall for the caps. So when you put the cap on the nipple gets bent"
2,didn't work for me,"I spent around $50 on a set of these bottles only to find they made her gas worse. The nipples is big and hard(she was breastfed for the first three months and only took the bottle sometimes at first, now she is on all bottles). I think air was getting in around her mouth b/c milk was always leaking out of her mouth too. Next......they are a MAJOR pain to clean even with a dishwasher. I started using playtex nursers during the hurricane because we had no power to run the dishwasher to wash those awful things and found that the nipple is soft, smaller, more like the breast, they don't leak like Avents if you use a playtex drop in, easy to clean and most important, her gas problem was greatly reduced. The downside is the cost of the liners. I would buy these bottles as a last resort if all others have failed to help your child's colic problem"
5,Amazing!,"Unfortunately, I was only about to bf my son for about 2 weeks until we had to switch to formula feeding. We tried everything. Started at the regular evenflo, went to the playtex, then the avent, and it seemed like no matter what we did, he just threw everything up. He started dropping weight and we freaked. My mother walked into babies r us and said, ""I want the best bottle here. Period."" The sales clerk handed her a 3 pack of the Dr Brown's wide neck 8 oz bottles and that did the trick. My baby is no longer gassy and whiny. He does still spit up a little on occassion... but he's a baby. They tend to do that.Overall, I would recommend the Dr Brown's bottles, wholeheartedly. I just wish we would've found them before I spent so much money on all the other bottles we got."
5,Really worth the money!!,"I just wanted to write and say that my baby thank god is not colicky...yet....but perhaps these bottles have something to do with that. My son is a month old, and he is doing great on these bottles! I highly recommend them, and as for the previous review written by swineset.The bottles will leak when heated IF you do not unscrew the cap slightly, and let the milk/pressure out of the resevoir. I called Dr. Brown directly, and the people there were so very helpful, and they told me that you have to do that, they actually recommended that you do not warm the bottles with the pieces in them.So, I have an Avent bottle warmer (which is great) and i take the bottles apart and warm it without the pieces. It may sound like a pain...but it really isn't...and it's well worth it for your baby...don't you think??"
5,the best for breastfeeders,"I am a first-time breastfeeding mom, my three month old son has been getting the bottle now and then since six weeks old to prepare him for my upcoming return to work. We started with the Platex VentAir bottles since they are supposed to be the next best thing, as for leaking and having to really suck to get anything, they are definitly great, but the nipple is totally straight, and my son has a hard time getting a good grip to suck. I tried Avent next, since the nipple was realistic, but the flow is so fast that when you turn the bottle down to feed, it's already spitting milk out! As a last resort, we tried the Dr. Brown's wide neck. I was reluctant because of the cost, but I bought one to try, and it's wonderful. I'm concerned that the assembly will cause confusion with his dad, grandma, daycare, etc. for a while, but they seem to be the best! I'm on my way back to the store to buy more tomorrow!"
1,Made things worse!,"My 6 week old was having gas issues and spitting up a bit so we decided after reading the reviews on here to try Dr. Brown's. What a waste of time, money, and laundry detergent! For 3 days I tried these bottles and for 3 days he burped more and spit up MORE. We had to change his crib sheet 3 times in one day and his clothes and mine 4 times in one day all because he spit up a large amount of formula. So back to Avent for our little guy.NOTE: It has now been over a month since switching back to Avent and our little guy is doing MUCH better. Sure he still spits up some but nothing like he did with the Dr. Brown's bottles."
5,My baby is even preferring these over all other bottles,"The nipple is soft and goes about the same distance as a mother's breast while breastfeeding. When, after some serious prior problem with nipple confusion, I was able to breastfeed my child consistently, she started to prefer the texture and flow of these bottles over even the Avent. They were most like breastfeeding for her. They had a slower flow from the Avent. Avent will stream out, even on the lowest stage nipple, these make her work a little more for her dinner, but more similar to breastfeeding.2nd point: What would put Booger from the Revenge of the Nerds series to shame on any other bottle, was barely audible after these bottles. That has been their most impressive point."
2,Good bottles,"I love this brand of bottles but, buy the thinner bottles. The wide Dr Brown bottles cost more and were to big for my daughter. The other nipples were better on the thinner, tall Dr. Brown bottles. Easier for a newborn to eat from the thinner bottles"
2,product doesn't match with what photo shows,"the product i received doesn't match with what photo shows and differs from the one i bought before. i cant tell the difference from ""3 Pack Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle 8 oz"", which is much cheaper."
4,Best bottles we have tried!,"We were having to supplement our son with formula starting at the age of two weeks. We tried using the popular Avent bottles and noticed, and heard, the amount of air bubbles entering the bottle (and ultimately our son) while drinking. Shortly after starting the bottles he began to have symptoms of colic. We then tried the Playtex Ventaire bottles, which leaked every time they had any amount of liquid in them. My son also could not latch very well with the narrow nipple. I heard about Dr. Brown's bottles from my sister-in-law and decided to research them. From what I read, I decided to try the bottles and we have been extremely happy with them. Our son is now 9 weeks old and still has some spit up with the bottles but the lack of air intake is definitely worth it. I wish I would have tried these from the beginning."
5,We Love These Bottles!,"We started with Dr. Brown's when my daughter was just three weeks old - she's now 10 months - and have loved them from the very beginning. We've used them both for breastmilk and for formula, and they've been great for both. We've never had trouble with gas and have had very few spitting-up episodes, and I give all the credit to the bottles. They're comfortable for me to hold, light enough that even a young-ish baby can hold them on their own, and easy to fill. The cleaning is a bit of a pain - more parts than in other brands of bottles - but it's worth it. And we haven't found that Dr. Brown's leaks any more than any other brand. Definitely give these a try - they're great!"
4,How to prevent leaks,"Didn't give 5 stars because parts can be a pain to wash. BUT, these are wonderful bottles and have never leaked on me, except when I've made the mistake of assembling the whole thing and putting it in the hot water. The heat creates pressure in the clear reservoir tube which sucks up the milk and causes leakage. If you unscrew the lid a little to let some air in while the bottle is being warmed, you eliminate this problem. Just remember the screw it back tightly when you get ready to feed :)"
5,Best bottles for fussy babies,"Our doctor changed formulas 4 times, but our little one was still very uncomfortable due to the gas. A friend suggested trying the bottles, and within a short time, she seemed less fussy. We quickly switched to the Dr. Brown bottle exclusively and feeding time became much easier on her. We tried another brand of bottles one last time just to see the difference, and the gas seemed much worse with just one bottle. Even with the extra work involved, we will only use these bottles in the future."
4,We love them!,"We tried all types of bottles - from the Walmart-brand to the mega-fancy. We love the Dr.Brown bottles. The wide-neck allowed for an easy latch. The venting system REALLY works - unlike some playtex varieties. The variety of nipple speeds allowed us to keep up with our champion chugger's appetite and I feel as though my son is able to get plenty of fluid without a battle with the bottle. The bottles are a little more work to clean and a bit heavier than others - so harder for my son to hold on his own (now that he's older). We have used them for nine months, though, and have only had one ear infection and very few problems with gas. I pass them along to new moms that I know. The price stops me from buying twenty, but I can easily buy a three-pack since I know the new mom will only need an introduction before buying more on her own."
5,You Have To Try These Bottles!,"We absolutely love these bottles! We have used them with our son since birth and have been very happy with them! Others may think they are expensive, but they are cheaper than buying those stupid liner refills for the Playtex bottles. Never again will I buy those things! (we used those with our first son, and it sickens me to think of how much money we wasted on those things)As for the added ""work"" of cleaning, we just throw them in the top rack of the dishwasher, and they hold up like a champ! Our son does well with the nipples, and even switches back and forth between the tall models and the wide-neck versions. My favorite ones are the wider, ergonomic ones, plus they fit in the dishwasher a little better. You won't be disappointed in these bottles! They are perfect for all babies, with collic or not."
3,Less gas but VERY LEAKY,"My second child has lots of gas and reflux so my friend recommended that we switch from Avent to Dr Browns. He does have less stomach gas, which comes from drinking, but the same amount of intestinal gas, that comes from digestion- so I guess the bottles help with half the problem. The extra parts aren't a problem, HOWEVER, these bottles have about pushed me over the edge with the LEAKING. We cannot get the leaking to stop and have drips of formula all over our carpet in every room. This morning I found my cell phone floating in formula when a bottle (with a travel cap on) leaked in my purse (my fault, I knew better). Be sure to bring a plastic bag and towel when traveling with a full bottle. I'm not sure if I would buy these bottles again."
5,Happy Baby!,"I had been using Avent bottles after going back to work. Everyone else used them...why shouldn't I. My daughter began getting fussy in the evenings(most babies do, right?). She had awful problems with gas build-up and passing painful,loud gas. She would cry and pull her knees up after each bottle, sometimes refusing to eat. After giving her gas drops for weeks, I decided to try the Dr. Browns bottles. What a lifesaver! She doesn't pass nearly as much gas, is happy and content in the evenings and falls asleep without a fuss! Thank you Dr. Brown! The extra steps are worth it for a happy baby!"
2,No great results here...,"After talking to my daughter who had tried everything she knew to do about baby's gas, I looked online for some solution she had not tried yet. Dr. Brown's had amazing reviews so I ordered 2 3-packs for baby grandaughter. They didn't seem to have any effect at all. I am glad they have been helpful for some of you, tho. It's a very difficult time for moms...long days, longer nights, little sleep. Oh, how I wish Dr. Brown's had been her solution. Best wishes!"
4,The best bottles!,"These are the best bottles I have tried yet. The thing that makes them unique is that they really prevent the air bubbles from coming in better than any other bottle we've tried. The only negative I see is that there are several pieces which makes washing a bit of a nuissance - still, it's worth it if you have the patience to do a wash a day!"
4,Great Bottles!,I purchased this system for my newborn in 10/05. I love them. They really help with her gas problems. She burped with ease after her feedings. The nipple flow was perfect. I never had a bottle leak at all. The cleaning of all the parts is alot but it was worth it. I would buy again for next child.
4,STARBUCK BRAND OF JUSTICE!!!,"Anothe book about Luke Starbuck. His friend Ben Laugham has ben gunned down. He is determined to find the killers, little knowing it would lead him to Billy the Kid. He faces The Kid and also has to face the men The Kid is working for. He also has to put up with Pat Garrett, who is more concerned about getting relected than doing his job. Can Luke find all the powers behind the killing? A fairly fast moving western. I gave it a four instead of a five because several pages are all talk with out much going on. As a whole it will hold your attention. I like Lukes brand of justice. It is much better than some we have today."
5,worked great,Had to make a grasshopper pie in this pan and it looked great when I was finished. nothing stuck to the pan and the shape looked very good.
4,Warm Feet,"These are great when you come in from the cold after walking on snowy grounds. They heated my feet and kept warm for quite a long while. They cannot be used for walking around, though, in that they are weighted and don't stay on well, but they are perfect for sitting in your recliner and relaxing while you are comforted."
3,** Worthwhile if you have nothing better to do,"It's not bad. But it's not great.First the good: the twins are really cool, played their roles very well, suitably creepy and sinister. I also liked the girlfriend. And the detective, Orlando Jones, was great.The not so good: I found it too jumbled and didn't really get the ending. And there were many unexplained things as well. I mean, I get what happened. But I think it could have been done better. Also, the movie would be ok to watch with teens but for the first ten minutes. If they hadn't put the swearing and the sex scene in there, it would be an ok suspense to watch with your teens. Why do they always have to do that?I can't say I was disappointed since I had no expectations. But it certainly isn't something I will watch again or recommend to a friend as a 'must-see'.Co-editors of ""First Year University: A Survival Guide"""
3,"""Twins with a camera, how do you forget something like that?"" Easily......","I have ambivalent feelings towards this movie; it was rather tame, with no genuine surprises. I found the twins more annoying than scary. It is a fascinating idea though, I will admit that, but I found myself questioning a lot of what went on because it simply didn't make sense after the not-so-big reveal at the very end. (Oddly enough, all through this movie I kept thinking of Billy Mumy in ""It's a Good Life"" episode of The Twilight Zone, now there was a scary kid with super powers!)I didn't hate this movie, it was easy enough to watch, it didn't bring up any adverse reactions, it was just....eh. Which I suppose, is not the best recommendation.I'm definitely not keeping it as I have no desire to watch it again."
3,Not what i expected.,"i Really Wanted to love this movie, but i just couldn't. I Mean, it wasn't a bad movie, it was just Okay. I am still going to buy it, and add it to my collection, and i probbably will end up watching this again. Maybe, i will learn to love it, as i have with alot of movies. i Build up, high expectation's for movies, and when they don't live up to my hype, i am dissapointed, so i need to work on that. I Hope i do end up loving this movie."
4,"Original story, I think...good casting","The story was original enough, though I wished for a bit more exposition on the experiment and the twins' history.The guys playing the twins are great, and there is a weird mood/atmosphere running through the film that makes it stand out from most others. This is one of After Dark's better efforts."
3,"A world in the style of Jack Vance, but not as clever.","Capella's Golden Eyes is a good attempt at world building. The culture and structure of an interstellar colony is described, but as is so often the case, the characters seem one-dimensional and unemotional. The structure of the book doesn't help, either. Starting out with a mysterious group of aliens coexisting with the human colony, two disappearances and an enigmatic death one might think that the book would climax with the unravelling of these puzzles, but it doesn't. The book resolves things in an off-hand way and fades out, rather than closes with a neat finish."
3,Vintage Page pix hawk classic spy-jazz,"The stunning foldout packaging features dozens of classic Irving Klaw photos of Betty Page at the very pinnacle of her modeling career. The disc itself, naturally, has absolutely nothing to do with Page, Klaw, or burlesque. Instead, this is an excellent collection of 22 tracks of ""spy jazz."" Dramatic, horn-driven arrangements, heavy on the percussion (bongos and tympani abound) and twangy early-60s guitars. The lack of liner notes leaves the origins of these tracks to the listener's imagination, but given the titles (e.g., ""Path of Crime"" ""Johnny's Dive"" ""The Big Strip"" and the title track, ""Danger Girl"") one can conjure up some great sources. The composer list will be unfamiliar to all but avid soundtrack collectors, with John Barry (Bond films and an extensive career in movie scores) being the best known. The obscurity of the music's origins, however, only adds to the overall air of this package's mystery."
4,"Tone, Taste & Drive","This CD offers a fine mix of driving, up tempo Bluegrass along with inspired choices in '60's cover tunes such as The Beatles ""Yesterday"" and The Turtles ""Happy Together"" - a resophonic tour de force. Phil Leadbetter's style has great drive, and a nice arpeggio-based style that combines ideas reminiscent of Mike Auldridge along with the snappy pull-offs that defined Jerry Douglas' style. A fine addition to the CD collections of both Bluegrass fans and fans of guitar-based instrumental music."
5,Smashes your emotions,"From the opening line, ""The concierge called to say two police officers wanted to speak to her,"" Charlotte Vale Allen holds your attention as we enter the world of Kyra Latimer. Kyra has to face reality and conditions that are not easy to accept and doesn't have an hourglass figure: she's fat, real. Sorry, this isn't Harlequin romance dribble. ""Parting Gifts"" is gut-wrenching, funny, and informative (I cried and laughed once in the same chapter). Kyra's friends and family are real as well. I didn't want the book to end. The book will embrace your heart and then smash your emotions as you keep reading, unable to do anything as the story unfolds. Just like in real life. This book is brilliant and takes you to a place that you soon won't forget. You will hate some characters and love others. I've been an avid reader of Charlotte Vale Allen for years and this book is a winner!"
2,Disappointed,"This was my 8th and last Charlotte Vale Allen book. My sister is a devoted fan of Ms. Vale Allen's works, and I've tried to share her love of Ms. Allen's plotting and characterazations. However, Ms. Vale Allen's improbable views towards parenting and the role that parents play in the lives of their children, leave much to be desired.Yes, there are flawed parents out there, and children who are far wiser than their family units. I'm all for realism in literature, but in eight novels, read at random, all with the protagonist being a potential victim of at the hands of a ""stupid"" mother and a ""brilliant but psychotic"" father; I'd have to say enough already!"
4,Queen Kelly,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
5,¿WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?,"This little machine is wonderful . I really did not know much about photography before I had this camera . I bought it primary because I am a doctor and need it for have a record of important cases . It took me only to read the manual and a little practice in order to be able to acquire wonderful pictures of everything I want , with or without macro , in color or B/W... whatever... The resolution is perfect ; with the rechargeable battery you don't have to worry for power , ... in other words , I really can't imagine what else to ask for in a camera!!!!! It's just amazing!!!!!!I carry it wherever I may roam ."
4,works really well,"This camera works well. The image quality is good. It does not break or malfunction. The CompactFlash card is popular and nearly standard. On the downside, the battery life is quite short, there is no included USB-computer support, and pictures seem to come out somewhat overexposed so an image editing program is a must. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to get this camera again because the good points really outweigh the bad."
4,Standard Camera bought for Company Use,"I am the Information Services Director for a Company that has 8 remote sites on the East Coast. I was asked to find a camera that can be used by 4 departments and at every site. After researching I found the Powershot S20 and we have set it at the standard camera. We use this camera everyday for events, building pictures and for our local access channel.This camera is small, easy to use and when connect via the USB port, the download time to a PC is incredible. The people who use this camera have never used a camera in their life, so having them come to me the next day and telling me how easy it is, was a great relief to me.The only draw back to this camera is the battery, I highly suggest buying the charger kit for this camera for the added money, mostly because the battery that comes with it drained after the first two hours, and $20 for each new battery is really not worth it."
4,A Beginner's Camera,"I originally bought this camera because of its size and the fact that I had a spare Microdrive lying around. After using it for a few days, I realized that it is truly a beginner's camera. There is little manual options and those that are there, are very ""dumbed down."" The resulting pictures from the 3.3 Megapixel CCD are extraordinary. They are very sharp and crisp. However, if you are taking pictures of objects further than about 5 ft. away, make sure there is ample lighting because the flash is sub-par. The Microdrive and the power supply kit certainly add to the overall price of the product, but IMHO, are true necessities. In conclusion, if you are a beginner and are looking for a simple, easy to use camera that takes great pictures, this is camera for you. But if you are an intermediate user who would like to control his picture taking a little more than 'point-and-click', look elsewhere."
1,Poor quality and terrible customer service,"If possible, I would have given the camara some negative stars.I was glad when I first got the camera. But it did not function at all after I used the camera for less than 10 times within a year. I called customer service and was told to send it back to factory. I was told I would be charged about $160 to fix the camera. I asked what the problem was and was told they did not know what the exact problem was until they took the camera apart and gave a close check!If you want to find a reliable digital camera, try some other brand but not canon."
2,Bad color corrispondence,"Nice little camera, but with some relevant problem with color balancing. Also Flash is not so performing (or too strong or too weak). The biggest problem I had is that I have to spend hours at the PC to fix color and hue balancing. Sometimes good quality."
2,bad controls good pictures,the pictures are fine but the controls and tiny buttonsare too aggrivating for words!!
1,Everything Wrong!,Bought it 2 years ago for $$$ and $$$$ for battery pack.POSITIVE:NONE!NEGATIVE:1. OVER PRICE.2. TERRIBLE PICTURES.3. BATTERY ONLY LAST 20 TO 30 MINUTES (40 PICTURES).4. 2X ZOOM ?? CAN'T DO A THING!!5. NO UNDERWATER CASEMUST BE BLIND TO SAY IT IS A GOOD CAMERA!SKIP IT! NOT WORTH A DIME!!!
4,Advice needed.,"The reviews on the S20 have influenced my decision to purchase, BUT I hold a webcertificate with which I am planning to purchase the camera. US legislation prevents shipping outside the USA, so my intention is to have it shipped to my son in Houston who will eventually bring it to Australia. Will I have difficulties using it in Australia due to different voltage?"
4,Amazing,"I picked up this camera to do a web catalog photo shoot of flowers. I found it to be an impressive camera for its size. Get the IBM Microdrive because the 3 megapixel images will fill up a memory card fast!Battery life was good but it uses a proprietary battery. It also takes 2CR5s but eats them up in a hurry.Very good image quality, works well in macro mode. One thing I wish it had is the ability to review the image right after you took it. You can't do it easily, you have to switch camera modes and the lens closes up. With the microdrive you can afford to take extra shots and weed out the bad ones later.Good transfer software although the serial cable mode is incredibly slow...go with USB.All in all, I love this little camera which packs a punch."
4,Great Camera - bad battery,"Great optics, nice list of options. Takes great pictures. software bundle is good. Problem is the battery. You get one of the ... throw-aways, which lasts about 45 minutes. The rechargeable battery pack is ..., which is ABSOLUTELY NECCESSARY for this camera, so consider the price to be ... more than the going price. Also, the rechargeable batteries last a bit under an hour. You'll also want to get a bigger memory card. Using the highest resolution, lowest compression takes some great pictures, and you'll want a big card to take lots of pictures."
3,NICE TOUCH,NICE PRODUCT. EXCELLENT IDEA TO PROTECT THE SENSITIVE SCREEN. I USE THE CLOTH ON MY LED SCREEN FOR MY CAMERA TOO.
4,Enjoy this product,"This item is nice to use, with heat or cold. I would suggest it too others. The only down side is the rice tends to move around and it would be nice if the seams with baffled so the rice would stay evenly distributed. Other then that, it is a nice alternative to a heating pad, if u want something cozy and warm and therapeutic without cords to drag around."
3,It's too smelly,It comforts my neck. But the herbal smell is very strong. So I barely use this product.
2,Not enough seperation lines,This product needs several more stich lines to seperate the herbs and keep them in place. When you drape it around your shoulder the contents all shift down with gravity leaving no heat on top of your shoulders.
2,disappointed,"The wrap is partially-filled and the baffling is poor, meaning that you can shake down the seeds to one side and have empty fabric for OVER HALF of the length of the wrap. Since the seeds carry the heat/cold, I end up having to constantly readjust and fold it over. I am sewing the ends and the neckline to try and keep the seeds together. If I had been able to see it first, I would not have purchased it."
1,Not As Described!,"This wrap - while nice for neck, shoulders, and back - does not smell nice after a few uses. It's supposed to have twelve soothing aromatic herbs. Unfortunately, after a few uses, it smells like nothing more than cooked rice. Over the Christmas holidays, I took it with me to a party. One person said it smelled like sausage while another said it smelled like chili and another said it smelled like urine! I kid you not! And then whatever clothes you are wearing when you use it also smell horrendous. It's a great style and provides warm comfort, but unfortunately, they sooo missed the mark on the aromatics!!!"
1,herbal fan shoulder wrap,WHEN I RECEIVED MY 2 SHOULDER WRAPS I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE WRAPS WERE COVERED IN A FURRY KIND OF MATERIAL AND AFTER BEING IN THE FREEZER FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS LAID OUT FLAT I PUT ONE ON MY NECK AND THE FURRY MATERIAL WAS HOT NOT HELPING COOL ME DOWN. I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER BOUGHT SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THEY HAVE A PERMANENT PRESS LIKE MATERIAL AND ARE THE GREATEST. CHANGE THE MATERIAL THEY ARE MADE OF ON THE OUTSIDE AND GET BACK TO ME. THANKS SUSAN
2,Not for Banjo Lovers!,"This book reads as if it were written to fulfill a thesis requirement, and not out of love for the banjo. The author only touches on banjo technique and music, instead she prefers to base her arguments on iconography. I gave it two stars since it provides some interesting perspectives on race relations in the U.S., but it severely falls short for anyone who loves banjo music and the instrument itself."
5,What a find!!!,"I ordered these in both camel and black, hoping that I wouldn't be sorry. Well, no disappointment here. They are very stylish and very very comfortable. I am extremely satisfied with Amazon as usual. Thanks for a great deal!!"
4,Very Informative and Entertaining,"Great set of shows. The Rio de Janeiro one is not one to watch with your family, though. Aside from that, they are very interesting and entertaining. They go to places where other travel shows don't go and do adventurous things that other travel shows don't do. I wish that all of them instead of just the Bolivia one would have the option of watching it in Spanish, though."
1,TOTALLY WORTHLESS!,"Lonely Planet should be embarrassed. This video offers zero practical information for travel to N. India. Camera work is sloppy, even out of focus at times. ""Narrative"", if it can be called that, is incoherent. Video ""host"" is completely clueless about the culture in which he is a guest. He slaughters every Hindi/Sanskrit/Pali word or name he encounters. His joking, at times mocking, attitude is denigrating and insulting to this venerable culture. Zero stars should be an option for this one. Do yourself a favor - don't buy it!"
3,good but distracting,"I wanted this for my class and I do use them. The overall visuals and information are good - however, there are some things that keep it from being exactly what I needed. First, the accents and terms used by the guides can be hard for my students to get past. They are distracting. Second, a teacher has to be careful to view ahead of time to edit - one on Argentina is great and then she shows a cow being butchered - guts flowing, etc. I know they are famous for their meat, but we didn't need that. Or another who takes us to the market and then throws in 'papaya is good for love making'. The market was great - that was stupid to add."
3,Very good but a bit outdated,"Always enjoy watching these travellers presenting different places in their unique ways, the reason I give this box set only 3 stars is they are a bit too old, I was kinda expecting shows from less than 10 years ago so they'll be more reflective to the current status of the countries, esp. we are thinking about going there soon but don't really feel comfortable to use these as reference since they are more than 10 years old, things must have changed a lot."
3,Quality of DVD is poor,"Good value for money, but quality is very poor.. Even if it is not blueray, it could have been better"
4,GlobeTrekker SouthAmerica 20120801,"Meggan, Ian, and others told us about the many places we could visit in South America. It was great; however, the four (4) stars is due to the material's age - some dating several years ago.Overall, it is the best information available on the market that I could find to give me the insight that I needed.I would recommend, if for nothing more than the entertainment offered."
1,do NOT buy from globetrekker,these guys are really scam artists... they run around to different countries and tape a few shots here and there with a home video camera and then but a nice glossy label on their box and packaging and sell it to you for absurd prices of 39.95 plus 9.95 shipping.They have no breadth and depth to their videos. These are the WORST travel videos I have ever seen. do not buy any product from them!!and they will not let you return anything unless it is in original plastic wrapthese guys are worse than used car salesman
4,High school crush,"Ever wondered about your first crush? What would have happened if you two got together? Well, Claire finds out years later when she is reunited with her crush, Duncan. Their chemistry is H-O-T and they are able to bring out the best in each other. Throw in protective family members, a gold-digging friend and a bet and you will have a wonderful romantic story."
5,stereo,"This was a great find. Easy to hook up, sounds great and works perfect in my jeep, which has ruined two stereo's because they got wet. Now I don't have to worry."
1,don't bother,Not a marine grade set. The cd player would not eject the disc I had inside. Sound was ok. Stereo case was rusting after 8 months of use. Audio would go in and out at speed. According to troubleshooting it claims that the radio was at the improper angle. I modified the angle and still would go in and out. I replaced the stereo with a pioneer and have had no issues since. The speakers have ok sound but again not marine grade. The mounting hardware has rusted and now the cones have seperated from the speaker. Trust me on this one. Don't waste your money.
1,PYLE of S%&t,"The first reciever I recieved lasted about two days on my boat. The second had issues after about four uses. This is not a ""Waterproof"" head unit by any means. If you find it on sale for half price, don't bother wasting you time and money on this Pyle. I pulled the speakers out also after a few months."
1,Not worth Installing,This unit is cheap .. I thought if I get a few years outta the device no problem. Well when the cheap screws (not stainless) for the speaker mount caused rust runs down the side of the gel coat that was initial problem. Run to HW store to buy ss screws then clean rust.. Soon after the weather housing spring fell apart so I had to remove cover all together.. Only made a few fishing trips and the stereo unit is dead in less than 9 months.. heading to the store for a new (different) stereo. Dont wast your time with a pyle. Cheap in every sense of the word. JUNK!
1,"If this is for a boat, steer clear!","It's a Pyle alright, a pile of s***. I purchased this unit thinking it was the right thing for my 17ft KeyWest. It was the worst electronics purchase I have ever made and I wish I had read the reviews first. I learned my lesson. The unit lasted 3 weeks, and I am out alot of my time and money. The detachable face plate shorts out along with every other function of this unit and is useless. I rarely write reviews, but hope to save someone else the trouble I had. I went with a Dual MXR42 (Google it) with no moving or detachable parts and it has proven to be superior in every way. Buyer beware of this unit."
1,Junk,"I installed this unit like I've installed countless stereo's in the past. The unit powered on successfully and then proceeded to not take my cd. I decided to push the cd a little further to see if the unit just engaged the cd a little later than most. Well long story short, it never took the cd, my cd is now stuck because there is no manual release, and the motor is obviously broken. I can't even listen to the radio or aux because every 5 seconds or so, the unit acts like it's taking the stuck cd again and switches to cd mode until it realizes it can't play the cd and then switches back.For your own sake, keep looking."
5,Adult collector loves it too,"As an adult collector of children's literature, this book is one of my favorites, too. The adults in the town are uptight and concerned about the unnatural appearance of a cookie tree. The message is one of enjoying your blessings and also, I think, of not being afraid of the strange or unknown. Wonderful book."
5,"Great illustrations, fun story line",I loved this book as a child. It takes place in medival times and all the adults are afraid of a tree that grows full of chocolate cookies. They think that it is evil or bad luck. It took a child to suggest eating one and the adults rejoiced at the blessing it truly was.
2,buyer beware,One year(to the day) post-purchase the television just stopped working. Wouldn't ya know it labor warranty only lasts 90 days. Philips knew they made a cheap TV.
1,Philips 32PT5441/37,"Don't do it. Television worked for about 17 months then quit with the same characteristics as hundreds of other victims. The power off with flashing sequencing lights. Customer service is no help and the authorized service center wants $70 to ""diagnose"" a problem that they likely know very well, considering the number of identical problems. It's a big hassle and will involve a labored process to contact BBB, class action stuff and consumer protection agencies. I am willing to go through the process, but I would advise you avoid this product at all costs. There are other reasonably priced televisions out there. Good luck."
2,Arbor Gates,"set worked just fine....for about 1 1/2 years,then it would not come on any more....stay away from this product!!!!!"
1,poor FM sound,The Insten FM-10 I got has a extremely annoying whine that is present all the time. At first I thought it was a ground loop problem but the whine is present whether the car is running or not. Unfortunately the online seller I bought it from hasn't responded to any emails so I don't know if mine is defective or not. I suspect they are all of very poor quality and mine is representative. On the upside it does work well as a charger.
5,Marvelous,"Give me more, give me more. I've had this album for 3 years and could still listen to it back to back. His voice is divine, each song makes me want to dance. The second album, Lowly is also incredible. You'll like if you listen to Elbow, Radiohead, Keane, Massive Attack, Coldplay, Sigur ros..."
4,Great tea!,"Chamomile and organic, what more is there to say. This Camomile does the job without having other additives in the tea bag, only the flower. It calms wonderfully, relaxes in a few minutes. Also can be used as an eye flush if you have allergies or other eye irritants. Tradition Medicinals is a good brand and I recommend it to anyone looking for a great tea. Add some honey or lemon to make it even better."
5,Fantastic!,I drink this tea to relax and for stomach and digestive problems. It works every time. Very calming and a good all-around tea time.
5,Awesome!!!!! and USDA Organic,"I am not a tea drinker, just do it for the health benefits. I add this to my Traditional Med Green Tea to mask the taste of the green tea which I do not like. This chamomile tea is sweet and smells great. If I am bloated or have a tummy ache, I make a cup with 2 bags and it really helps. Subscribe and Save saves you tons of money with this tea. Love that it's organic and USDA labeled too."
2,Pretty disappointed,"It seems to me that Dr Martens are skating by on name brand recognition now. The stitching on these unraveled before my man had worn them for a year. How is that acceptable? The leather is also thin and not sturdy or suitable for heavy wear. I also had a not-inexpensive pair of Docs poop out on me because of poor quality, so I guess we'll have to find other brands for our boot-wearing needs."
3,"Beautiful boots, hard to wear","These boots are great to look at, but wearing them is a pain. The leather feels really cheap, it was hard to believe it was real, and I could not for the life of me break them in. They're a little big on me so I found myself, like other reviewers, getting blisters if I wore them too long. They also had a tendency to bunch up at the ankle, making it sore. If I had bigger feet and were taller, it probably would have had a better fit. Not reccomended for petites; stick with the mid-calf boots."
1,boots from china,These were Great boots when they were made in England. Now they are made in China and the leather is thin and the Quality no longer exists.
5,My favorite things...,"I have worn docs for 12 years and I wouldn't switch if someone paid me. They're tough to break in (being knee-length and all), but once they fit, they fit perfect. I wear them all year long and never get tired of the support and comfort they bring to my feet. Plus, they are quite sexy :) My only complaint is that the laces they come with are not my style, so I always have to buy a set of normal flat laces (which hold a knot better). If you treat them right from the start (seal and polish) they will treat you right for years."
4,Better than expected.,"When I first opened the box I wasn't too impressed. I had bought a pair similar to these years ago and ended up getting rid of them. But once I tried them on I was a quite surprised at how well they fit. I was worried at first that they might be a loose around the calves (the problem with the other pair). But these tightened very well. Other comments were posted that the material was too stiff and caused blisters on the ankles, etc. I do not think the material is too stiff and should break in rather quickly. The boots look a little shinier than in the picture, but that won't last with extended use. I really think these are going to work out in the long run and I would recommend them. Good value."
2,They Killed a Cow for THIS?????,"I chose these boots because they looked cool and because I figured that they'd be more comfortable than Heeled boots. WRONG! The reinforced seams in the back make the boots extremely durable, but also tore through the skin of my ankle. The leather is very rigid and difficult to walk in, and the tongue of the boot is cheap, narrow (so that it slides to one side as you walk), and does this weird bubbling thing when you try to lace the boots up that looks SUPER tacky. These boots are NOT worth the cost."
4,ITS THE PUNK NASTIES,"If you're looking for punk when it was PUNK!Dead Kennedys, Sid Vicious, T.V. Smith, Peter & The Test Tube Babies, Johnny Thunders... so many more"
3,more of the same,"if you like old school punk then this is the way to go. it has artists like the Sex Pistols, who were/are the most well known punk band of this era. forget the new wave of punk, this is punk at it's best and it's most original."
3,A very odd title,"This anime was very peculiar. Its kinda like Panzer Dragoon, except no annoying CG to bother you. I noticed that there is an empire of cats in this one who in my opinion are kinda like Nazis (thats only because of the way the leader raised his hand, other than that, they're ok). The story follows along a high school boy who fell into a mysterious world full of creatures. Zolba, one of the many creature of the land, is going to attack earth soon and it is up to the boy to stop him. In order to do so, he must gain the love of a Yappie (female/dragon). The movie is very funny at times and has ok action. The music was very nice and that theme song is just stuck in my head. Granted, it might not be everyones cup of tea, but try renting it and see if this is the kinda anime you like."
1,A $20 Lightweight Chinese-made Tablespoon--shame on Rosle,"I am very disappointed with this product. Save your money and use a normal tablespoon which, in essence, this is. This product is made in China and feels cheesy, lightweight and cheap.I own the Rosle Basting spoon, which is made in Germany and which I will use in my kitchen forever. This product is not in that category and I will now think twice about buying a Rosle product. If you do buy one, make sure it is made in Germany and not in China. (Make sure the description states, ""made in Germany,"" and not merely ""designed and engineered in Germany."" The latter means that the Rosle product is made in China.)"
4,Fits 8.1 Workhorse Motor Home,"This filter fits perfectly on the Workhorse chassis with 8.1 engine. Somewhat difficult to install - filter box is located above right front wheel. Either turn the vehicle's wheels all the way to the left or access from underneath the vehicle. My filter arrived with a lot of excess oil on it which had saturated the instructions page, not that I needed the instructions. It comes with a gasket which has a backing that must be removed to reveal the adhesive to stick it to the filter. The filter was so oily that the gasket adhesive would not stick to the filter and the gasket kept falling off when trying to install. I used some ""super glue"" to get it to stick and from that point, installation was a breeze. Excessive oil on the filter can lead to causing the mass air sensor malfunctioning and a resulting check engine light. I'm hoping this excess oil doesn't cause this in my motor home. I am using K&N filters in passenger vehicles with good results."
4,After 39 years...,"I saw this movie 39 years ago and have wanted to see it again ever since. I always missed it when it was on TV and finally I discovered I could search for it on the internet - and there it was!! I want to know where I can find the beautiful music that Joan Collins is playing on the piano before she dies. If you know it, please comment.'"
4,Death is really fun .,"Cd presents 14 tracks with very nice booklet.1-3 from demo Power through darkness 19864-7 from unrealesed 7'EP 19868-12 taken from Nightmare continues demo 198513 -14 are taken from Hallows Evil tape 1985.So,very old death metal like old Possessed,Master,rehearsal demo tapes of immortal Death ...Raw trashing sound,brutal lyrics.Archaic noise inferno,support it!!!"
4,awesome,"very melodic,heavy,grindish,awesome....everyone buy it.you wont regret it......its like exhumed meets mayhem meets symphony-X."
2,On NOT Learning to SPEAK French,"No, this is not a book about ""learning to speak French"", as the subtitle indicates -- rather it is a book about a man trying to overcome his linguistic shortcomings in fluently speaking the French language, while skewering the Alliance Francaise (language school), French scholars of Descartes, and French bureaucracy, all in one extended essay (too short to be dignified as a ""book"", really). It passes all understanding that the author believes that anyone other than his nearest and dearest care about his traumas in taking French lessons or being snubbed by his fellow scholars in Paris (or being stung by a yellow jacket in the good old U.S. of A., for that matter). A total waste of a long afternoon. Watson and the reading public would have been better served had he just bought a set of Pimsleur CDs and then shut up."
3,A snapshot of life in an ethnic minority,"Our book group (9 women in the UK Midlands) reviewed this book. We all enjoyed it, although it was the background and the meticulously described setting and details of everyday life which absorbed us. The plot is very light. However, it's not set in the 1960s as it claims. We all grew up in the late 60s and 70s in England and we recognised the details as early seventies e.g., ""Two years earlier we went to see Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" for my birthday. This film came out in 1971. There are many other examples we recognised from our own seventies schooldays. This flaw detracted from a richly evocative portrait of the life of a little Punjabi girl trying to be like the English people around her. White English all, we were able to step outside ourselves and take a look at our childhoods from another point of view."
4,Richest Hill on Earth divulges major copper find.,"The Butte, Montana mines were in full swing in the 1880s, producing large amounts of gold and silver with copper being a nasty by-product. Along came the Copper Barons and Marcus Daly decided to build his own smelter in Anaconda to save the costs of shipping the copper ore to Wales for smeltering. Several stories are intertwined throughout the book and it keeps the reader's attention. A good book, very factual, but the story ends leaving too many threads that need to be tied up. I was hoping for a sequel."
5,"Polyweb > Nanoweb, IMHO","I've used Elixir custom light acoustic guitar strings ever since the company sent me a set to test out before they were available at retail. I do prefer the older-style POLYWEB strings over the newer style NANOWEB, though. They don't last as long as the NANOWEB but they also don't have an artificial, ""tinny"" sound. (And don't get me wrong, even the POLYWEB strings last an incredibly long time) I'll keep using these strings as long as Elixir makes them."
4,Mostly Amazing Strings,These strings have an amazing sound and response! I wish they were less expensive because they seem to lose their sparkle in a short amount of time. The sound is so addictive that I feel the need to change strings more often. I have also broken more of these than any other brand with the same gage. I highly recommend these if you can afford the habit. They are remarkable.
3,A disappointing edition of a great movie,"I really liked both ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" and ""Muppet Treasure Island"". I think the Muppets to a fantastic job adapting literature to the screen in an enjoyable manner and I sincerely wish that they would return to this type of work (especially after the abysmal ""Muppets From Space"").HOWEVER -- unlike the first three Muppet movies, the DVDs for ""Muppet Treasure Island"" and ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" contain the ""fullscreen"" version only. ""Fullscreen"" is a euphemism for the cropped image, instead of the ""widescreen"" image (also called ""letterbox""). In other words you've lost bits of the image to the left and right of the parts you can see ... and with the Muppets there are always little interesting bits going on _everywhere_ in the image.Kudos for the movies, but a BIG ""shame on you"" for not releasing the widescreen edition on DVD."
2,"Good movie, bad release","Picture quality is OK, but not great. It is cropped so it doesn't show the full picture we saw in the cinema. Disney chose to mention this in extremely tiny print on the back of the box.I'll buy it when it comes out in widescreen."
2,Who cut the song?,A great part of the movie was cut when the song by Belle was removed! What a bummer! Bah Humbug!!!
3,something's missing...,"There seems to be a song missing (The Love is Gone is actually GONE) or there is a disk issue where it's skipped for some reason. As it's one of my favorite songs in the movie, I was more than a little disappointed.this is our family's favorite Christmas movie... we watch it year after year, and getting all the kids (now grown) around to tv to watch is one of our family traditions."
2,The Muppet Christmas Carol-Kermits 50th Anniversayr Edition,"I like the original Muppet Christmas Carol better, there was a scene that was delited that I was looking forward to see."
1,This DVD is a catastrophy,"The movie rates 5, the DVD is a massive disappointment.Mr. Scrooge's epiphany is with the ghost of Christmas past when he sees his love and she sings a moving song of a love that almost was. Michael Cane (Scrooge) sings a counter point in a quivering voice. It even brings Rizzo the Rat to tears. They cut the song and the DVD viewer is left wondering, ""Why would the rat be crying?""Try again, Disney!"
1,"NEW DVD, BAD EDIT DECISION","I am so glad that I didn't buy the new DVD without reading customer reviews first! I am dismayed that the new release would cut ""When Love Is Gone."" Other reviewers were exactly right when they noted the Muppets' version story turns on this scene because Scrooge (5-star by Michael Caine!!!!!) finally shows some remorse about his life. This scene is CRITICAL to understanding why Scrooge's life ended up so bitter in the first place! And Meredith, the actress, performed it beautifully, as did Caine in the short duet sequence. Those who disliked the song are probably those, like columnist Roger Ebert, who were unmoved by the classic Dickens story because, in essence, they just don't get it - the theme of a repentant heart.This movie is a Christmas Eve tradition for me and my daughter,Rebecca, who also appreciates great filmmaking and classic music scores. ""We're Marley and Marley"" and ""It Feels Like Christmas"" are all-time greats!Neal J. Roberts"
4,"Great, holiday classic","This is one of my favorite holiday movies so I would rate it 5 stars if it were only about the movie. I had to dock it one because of the missing ""When Love is Gone"" song. I realize that the song wasn't in the original theatrical version (which this DVD is) but the home release is the version I've come to love so this DVD seems incomplete. I hope that Disney eventually comes out with a Blu-ray that has both versions on it - and yes I will probably buy it."
5,Classic Muppets,Muppets are classic entertainment for both children and parents. The Christmas Carol is a fun twist on Charles Dickens Christmas story. We recommend it for any family.
5,The Muppet Christmas Carol,We have always loved this version of The Christmas Carol. Being in Blu-ray makes it all that much better. Buy it....
2,Missing the best song,"An incredibly disappointing thing that everyone should be aware of: the DVD version of this film is lacking the scene with Belle, and the song, ""When Love is Gone"" -- the whole thing is just yanked out. If you can find the VHS, go with that -- at least that is the complete movie. Even when you rent this movie now, you get the DVD version, missing the scene."
2,Missing Song on DVD ... VHS IS BETTER,VERY DISAPPOINTINGI love the missing song. I would really like an explanation - makes me want to return the movie. AS well as the LIE on the cover stating wide screen when it does not play wide screen.What's wrong with Disney?So upsetting to me...
5,If you love Christmas and the Muppets...,This will quickly become a family favorite and holiday tradition! Wonderful remake of an old story line that crosses generations!
1,"I LOVE this movie, but...","It cuts out the ""Love is Gone' song, where Scrooge's fiancee sings to him. I realize there was controversy surrounding that song when it initially released, but that was forever ago and most digital editions and DVD releases nowadays have that part. Worst of all, it doesn't say anything about it in the description. Boo Amazon :("
3,Not the Complete Film,"As others have said; ""When Love is Gone"" is missing from the film. Therefore you're paying for an incomplete film. I bought the Blu-Ray so I could, at least, watch in in HD but I'm very disappointed. The quality of the film otherwise is quite good. Not a great Blu-Ray transfer but better than the old DVD releases."
4,This DVD has it's flaws but it's still awesome,"I love this movie but I am however upset like some of you that ""When Love Is Gone"" has been cut. It is however in the full screen version of the DVD but not in the widescreen. Doesn't really make much sense to me but it's there still the same. The movie looks great and Michael Caine does an awesome job as Scrooge. The music is amazing and the muppet performers really did an awesome job on this film. It brings me to tears everytime I watch it."
5,Replacing an old favorite,My VHS of this movie finally gave out last year. I couldn't find it on my usual 'go to' sites. This is my favorite version of A Christmas Carol.
5,Brian Henson does his father proud!,"One of the finest renditions of Dickens' classic tale can be found in Brian Henson's Muppet Christmas Carol. The soundtrack is wonderful, the Muppets perfectly ""cast"", and Michael Caine, now an Oscar-winner, adds an immeasurable charm to the story as Scrooge. I would recommend this film to kids and adults of all ages. I'm in college and I love it. Not since the Fozzie Christmas TV special have the Muppets come together so delightfully for a holiday. Jim Henson was in that one for a moment, and this one does great service to his memory. Great Job Brian Henson!"
2,A Major disappointment,"I bought two copies of this; one for myself, one for my Grand Daughter. When it arrived the cellophane said it was made in Mexico and it looked it. The outer case looked like a pirated copy you'd get off a street vendor in Kabal. The disc itself was wafer thin and I can tell won't age well. The audio on my old VHS is better quality. Disney cheaped out on what is an American Christmas classic and for what? I paid retail so I would have it a long time. My old VHS will probably outlast it."
3,The Muppet Christmas Carol,"It was an easy picture to watch, mainly for children, but it was well put together. As always the talent behind the muppets is excellent."
5,Amazing as Always,"This movie is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies. This is great since it has the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy. An added bonus was anytime that the movie is paused muppet characters will sing christmas carols. Totally awesome!"
3,Not for young kids,"Not for young kids, and not enough muppets and songs too much adults. I would say for older kids b/c it does stay close to actual storyline"
4,Good then...good now.,"I love the Muppets, ask anyone of my friends...and I love their interpretation of the classic. I personally get tired of remake after remake of old classics, but when the Muppets re-did this movie, it was if I was six years old again watching my favorite Muppet pals.Michael Caine is wonderful as Scrooge, Gonzo is a great Charles Dickens and Kermit is a heartfelt Bob Cratchit.The DVD has some great extra features, primarily an interview with Brian Henson, in which he is joined by Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat. There are also some snippits of an interview with Caine as he relays his first experience of working with the Muppets, great stuff."
4,Christmas Treasure,"This movie is a true treasure that warms the heart and gladdens the soul. Michael Caine is outstanding and it's his classic portrail that enhances the muppets. It's impossible not to sing along and to continue singing the wonderful music long after the movie is over.I would have given this 10 stars, but the colors seem a bit faded and it's not in wide screen. But don't let that stop you from buying this. It's a real treat."
5,my favorite film verision of A CHRISTMAS CAROL,While I just finished wacthig it for the 1st time in 15+ years. MCC is a very enterning take on Charles Dickens' classic. I honestly and truely think that Jim Henson would be proud of his boy Brian's work on this film.
4,Another Great Muppet Movie!,"I remember seeing this movie in the theaters and I loved it!What a terrific Muppet adaption Of ""A Christmas Carol"". The casting was subperb and the DVD extra's a real treat too! The interview with Gonzo,Rizzo and Brian Henson was a very nice added touch that includes some behind the scenes info that we would never have known! I have to applaud the commentary track also as it includes alot of the secrets that whent into the making of this wonderful Holiday film!Four stars only due to the fact this was not presented in widescreen, but I enjoy this DVD all the same! If your a big Christmas movie fan and a Muppet fan, you will not go wrong with this DVD. The magic of the Holidays AND the Muppets live in this great holiday film!!"
4,Love Is Gone,"The song was not part of the theatrical release version of the film so nothing has been 'cut' from the film - it is true to the original.The song was an addition to the LD and P&S; versions.From the look, the 2005 P&S; version reused a previous transfer and wasn't all that great. Disney probably didn't want to add the song for the new WS transfer then. Still, I don't know why they couldn't have included it with seamless branching in the new HD transfer. Especially since it is reprised at the film's finale.And while I like the song, my wife always thought it brought the story to a screeching halt. I would have to agree, but I still like it. However, I would guess that is why it wasn't included when shown in the theaters.I haven't watched the entire Blu Ray yet, but the samples I've watched look and sound great. Highly rcommended."
3,Be advised: widescreen version is not uncut.,"This DVD contains a 4:3 version and a 16:9 widescreen version.Disney Home Video reps have confirmed that only the 4:3 pan & scan version is the home video version which contains the full version of this movie. The widescreen version is the theatrical cut and does not include the song ""When Love is Gone""."
1,CONFIRMED - Blu-Ray Only Includes Disney's Studio-Mandated CUT version,"Disney has ruined THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL yet again by only including the cut theatrical release version of the movie, minus the song When Love is Gone. This is a song that not only is the heart and soul of the entire movie, but it was at one point added back into the film BY THE DIRECTOR, Brian Henson. Nobody involved in the production wanted the song removed -- it was taken out by the studio because they felt little kids would get bored during it. As it is, the film still has an awful cut where that song was supposed to be...and the intended, full version of the film will remain sitting on a studio shelf because Disney wants it that way. Pathetic."
1,1 Star Review for Inferior Cut Version,"As much as normally disdain these types of ""reviews"", I feel consumers should be warned that this upcoming Blu-ray will feature ONLY the shorter Theatrical Cut of ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"". It will NOT feature the song ""When Love Is Gone"", which I feel is critical to the character development of Ebenezer Scrooge. I, personally, will not purchase this film again until Disney restores this scene to future releases of the film, starting with the Blu-ray.I have given this a 1-star review so that studio will recognize the disservice that they are doing to fans of this film - but the film itself deserves 5 stars. If, and when, Disney releases the complete version - it will be deserving of the highest possible praise."
1,"Removed ""When love is gone"" what more is there to say?","The song ""When love is gone"" is a major turning point in Scrooge's change; it's the first time his cynicism totally falls away. It's a poignant, touching scene and crucial to the movie."
1,DO NOT BUY - THIS BLU-RAY IS BUTCHERED!!!!!!!,"Disney have butchered this release by only including the cut version of the film. It is approximately 4 minutes shorter than the full version - the most crucial song to the plot has been cut out. I for one will not be buying, and if anyone at Disney is reading this, then I implore you to tidy up this mess that has been going on for 10 years now on a future release."
3,"""When Love Is Gone"" is gone...","Without ""When Love Is Gone,"" I cannot rate this Blu-ray any higher than 3 stars. That song/scene is crucial to the film, and shouldn't have been cut. Shame on you, Disney."
5,Love it,"This is one of my favorite versions of the Christmas Carol. The digital copy is awesome- allows us to watch it through Itunes and our iphone, ipad, or laptop. This is great since we travel and don't always have access to internet to stream our movies."
3,"Great movie, bad DVD edition","Have owned the VHS version for years, and despite the somewhat negative reviews, decided to get the DVD version. Read the other more knowledgable reviewers who noted the cut of the sappy ""When Love is Gone"" song and lack of true widescreen format. Disney deserves a kick in the grundle for this! So, I'm giving this format a 3 stars, although I also think the movie is a 5 star."
3,Disney DVD Disappointment,"""Muppet Treasure Island"" and ""Muppet Christmas Carol"" are both good movies, but Disney came out with a bad DVD. Both of the movies are in full screen format. I think they should really have offered wide screen versions of the films. The Special Features of Muppet Christmas Carol are: *Audio Commentary by Director Brian Henson. *Frogs, Pigs, and Humbug: Unwrapping a new Holiday Class, which is a making of documantary. *Christmas Around the World. *On the Set which are the out takes from the movie. *And animated menues.Over all, the special features are good, but i am not happy that it is only in full screen format. If you are mad as well call Disney to get it changed at: 1-800-723-4763."
1,DISNEY RUINED CHRISTMAS,"My brother gave this to me for Christmas because it's been my favorite movie since I was 7. We all sat around the TV to watch it, and... THE MOVIE IS INCOMPLETE. I realize that ""When Love Is Gone"" was not in the original theatrical release, but it is how most people have seen the film for the last 20 years. Couldn't they have at least given people the option to watch it in widescreen? If they didn't keep a copy of that scene in widescreen, they could have made that one scene P&S. I can honestly say that it put me in a bad mood all day. Thanks a bunch!"
3,"Classic movie, annoying edit","Trust Disney to decide what's best for everyone. They cut the Christmas past song ""When Love is Gone"" because they thought kids wouldn't like it. I was going to replace my full-screen DVD version with this Blu-ray but after watching this version I'll keep my DVD. It makes sense that Disney bought LucasArts. Now they can get together and cut huge holes out of my childhood."
1,Still Incomplete.,"True fans of the movie who want the widescreen complete version, should seek out the Laser Disc. It's the only LD we watch, but we still bust it out every Christmas because it's a film worth watching in its entirety. I'm very disappointed they did not think to include the (beautiful, meaningful) missing song on the Blu-Ray.Saying a sweet song about love lost is ""too sad"" for a film based on a *Dickens* novel, demonstrates a real lack of understanding of the source material. It also nullifies the refrain at the end of the film (""The Love We've Found"").Come ON, people. If parents don't want their kids hearing ""When Love is Gone,"" I'm sure they will have the wherewithal to hit the ""Skip"" button, or stick to a lesser Christmas film for their precious little slowflakes.Please, someone release a widescreen high-resolution COMPLETE copy of this film in Blu-Ray."
1,Major disappointment with song cut,"It is a family tradition of ours that no Christmas is complete without a viewing of the ""Muppet Christmas Carol"". My husband and I bought this movie for our children when the VHS first came out. We all have pretty much memorized this heart-warming movie. We feel bad when the bunny gets decked with the Christmas wreath, and for the mice who get ""no cheeses for us meeces"". So you can be sure we were disappointed when we watched our new DVD this evening and saw that the song ""When Love Is Gone"" had been cut. Our kids are now grown and have small children of their own. I would have liked for my grandkids to see the movie the way it was meant to be seen. Our VHS copy is worn out. It is so very sad for whatever reason that Disney has cut out one of the best moments of the movie. Bad decision, Disney."
3,DON'T throw away your VHS version!,"This film, in its original widescreen version, is a 5-star movie for sure. This item (supposedly) replaces our VHS version and I was so looking forward to seeing it in DVD quality and viewing the bonus material that I was sure would be added. While the bonus material didn't disappoint, the inexplicable omission of the song ""When Love is Gone"" just left me baffled and ANGRY! Having it on the full-screen version provides cold comfort as I would never have even bothered with the compromised version until learning that the song is contained within. Disney's been known to be ""dumb like a fox"" and will probably correct the error in a ""from the vault"" re-release some time down the road. If justice were served, everyone who got snookered into buying this one would automatically receive a FREE copy! I won't hold my breath!"
1,disappointed,If I would have read the reviews first I wouldn't have ordered it. When love is gone cut out of the movie it's one of the best scenes in the movie. guess I will get out the old vhs.wasted my money
1,WARNING!!! Many 5 star ratings are NOT for this edition.,"For 20 years this has been my family's favorite Christmas movie. We watched it every year on our trusty VHS tape. This year I was excited to see the 20th anniversary edition. My kids are now grown and we got everyone together to watch the new edition.We were stunned when the song between Scrooge and Belle was cut from the movie. This 4 minute song demonstrates to the viewer why Scrooge was so bitter about Christmas. Why cut it now? It's 4 minutes! Without the song, the reprise at the end of the movie makes no sense.Also, Disney remastered the movie and completely lost the cold grey London feel of the movie. All the color chromo is turned to full bright and it looks like it's summertime on a cheap plastic movie set. Someone with a creative eye should re-remaster this embarrassing mess.Finally, Amazon should pull the star ratings on the previous edition. It is very misleading."
4,Light hearted and entertaining,"This is a surprise - a good one that works very well for both adult audiences as well as for children. Try it, you'll like it."
1,"Seriously?? No ""When Love Is Gone""again?","I will NOT be buying the blue ray version of The Muppet Christmas Carol until they decide to listen to people who love this classic Christmas movie and release it in widescreen version WITH the song ""When Love is Gone"" restored to its rightful place! I will continue to watch my VHS version. Forget it Disney! Lost another sale!"
1,Should really expect this at this point...,"Disney does it again. See the other DVD versions, reviews, forum threads, wikipedia page and other assorted dots from the corners of the internet for information on what, and in particular, why there's a problem. I don't often write reviews but it's ridiculous that this is still an issue and that they'll put more effort into covering their tracks and making the cut less obvious rather than simply using the full, true version and giving the fans what they want. We'll just have to wait and see what the intend to do to the twitching corpse that is the Star Wars franchise... on a topical and mildly related note... Disappointed but not surprised but beings of this manner."
4,The Best Version Of A Christmas Carol,"There have been so many movies made based upon ""A Christmas Carol"" but this one is the BEST one to own. Who could have guessed the muppets could be in such a heartwarming and endearing version?It's a movie that kids and grown-ups will both enjoy to watch on Christmas Eve with catchy songs, and cute little muppet figures you see ""A Christmas Carol"" which could be described as a rather dark- story into one of heartwarmth and sentimental feeling.Kermit plays as Bob Crachitt in this movie alongside Michael Caine who IS Scrooge. Michael Caine perhaps giving his best performance as Scrooge- who becomes changed over the course of one night...The movie is simply joyous and TIMELESS- the muppets are delightful and fit in well with the story. This movie is ADORABLE and the best muppet movie ever made. If your a muppet fan or simple looking for a good Christmas movie to watch definately BUY this movie- it will not disappoint!"
5,One of the best Christmas movies,I have loved this movie since it first came out and watch it every christmas. It came quickly and in good condition.
5,Our favorite Christmas Carol,"Muppet Christmas Carol is our favorite version of this Dickens story. It obviously deviates slightly because of the muppet characters, but not enough to change the general story. We love the music and the humor in it. Michael Caine is wonderful as scrooge and the ""ghosts of Christmas' past, present and future"" are very fun to watch. They all create the appropriate feelings.My only complaint has nothing to do with the movie, only the shipping. We paid extra to get it overnight and didn't receive it for 4 days. We did get it in time for Christmas, but it was on Christmas Eve and we had wanted to watch it before then."
5,The best family Christmas Carol,"This is without a doubt, the best version of Charles Dickens: A Christmas Carol. The message is delivered in a fun way with The Muppets. Michael Caine is a terrific Scrooge, miserly enough to apprehend, but lovable enough to root for. Sweet and funny with some great songs that you can't help singing along with. It is a tradition in our family to watch every Christmas Day. The little ones will love this version. The ghosts are whimsical and not scary in the least, the way only a Jim Henson production can be."
5,Great gift for the kiddos,This is a muppet-licious retelling of a classic tale. It made for a great Christmas gift for some great kids!
5,Hilarious Holiday Movie,"I never knew how funny this movie was, so glad I took a chance on it! Oh and kids will love it too!"
5,Love it.,A really good rendering of the Dickens story for kids. Caine is excellent. And the Gonzo / Rizzo shtick is really funny and helps with the scary parts.
4,Some of the movie was cut,"Some of the parts of the movie were cut. I didn't mind that, if there had been a warning that the movie was not sold in its entirety. With that said, we don't want to give a bad rating to the movie because it's one of our classic favorites."
5,Best Version of this Classic Tale,"Surprisingly true to Charles Dickens' original work, this movie strikes the perfect balance between humor and the grim subject matter. Not all the muppet effects are cheesy/funny; the special effects are surprisingly well done for a children's film from this period. A favorite of mine as a child, it still made me shed a few years even at 27 years old. It kept my fiance entertained even though he had never seen it before, a true achievement! One of the best muppet films, I think, despite it being the first film done after Jim passed away."
5,Muppet Christmas Carol with Michael Caine,"Of all the Christmas Carol movies, this is one of my favorites with the Muppets and Michael Caine. He plays the part of Scrooge so well. He holds his own with those adorable Muppets."
3,Gifts,"I'm afraid I made a mistake in buying the Muppets for four Xmas gifts, and it turns out none of them were as dediicated I am to all muppets."
4,"Love the movie, not sure of the DVD I received","I absolutely love this movie (one of my all time favorites--not just out of Christmas movies!). I find it weird that there are so many different versions people seem to recieve when ordering from this page, though. As I read through the reviews it seems not everyone got the same product. The one I received lets me choose if I want to watch the full theatrical version or the edited version (I also think that Belle's song is dumb so I watch the edited, typically). But, the disc came without full liner notes or anything like that, which seemed odd. Perhaps I just don't understand Amazon's fulfillment system so it seems a bit ""off"" to me. Nevertheless, overall happy with this purchase. Glad to own it for myself!"
5,Good drama and great fun,"Easily the best of the Muppet movies, I can only second the literature professor's comments. Dickens would very probably have liked this version of his story too. Michael Caine plays the part straight and with an intensity that suggests he had waited for the chance to play Scrooge for some time. If Alistair Sim was a light hearted Scrooge and George C Scott was bluff then Caine is deadly serious - which only gives the Muppets the proper foil to work their humour from. As Jim Henson once said, the best guests to have on the show are the ones that can treat the Muppets like actors. The humour is great, the songs and storyline touching. Great for kids of all ages and I am grateful to it for the line: 'You are SUCH an idiot!' which I use often."
3,The Missing Song!,"The missing song in question is a very important part of scrooge's character. It's what ties him to actually being human, not a monster. It's what makes him real and gives the viewer time to relate and feel compassion for him. I purchased this movie when it first came to DVD, and will not purchase it again until it is Blu-ray, original format and with the song added."
1,EDITED!! WHY IS THIS MOVIE EDITED???,"""The Muppet Christmas Carol"". Great movie, right? Of course it is! So WHY cut it UP?? Disney, for some idiotic reason unbeknownst only to them, decided to cut the beautiful song ""When Love Is Gone"" from this blu-ray movie because (are you ready for this?) ""it was too sad for a Disney movie"". Director Brian Henson couldn't even get it reinstated! So, before you spend the bucks for this blu-ray, you're NOT getting the true movie. You want an UNCUT version? You'll have to get alternate DVD or VHS version. OR get a laserdisc to get a prestine WIDESCREEN version WITH the song intact. Disney! WTF???"
5,Love this movie,We have been watching this movie since we were kids. We watch it every year and it gets better every time.
1,Original uncut version???,"If this is not the original uncut version, and doesn't include the song ""When Love Is Gone"", I will not purchase."
1,Dear Walt Disney! Do you think we're fools???,"First of all: I LOVE this movie!!! I give it five stars and more! But what is your problem with selling a perfect DVD to make your buyers happy? I saw the movie years ago in Germany in the original format and language. The beautiful Song: ""When love is gone"" was in that movie and the whole film was obviously in Widescreen format! So... what is your problem to release the DVD with these features. Do you want to make even more money, by saying in a couple of years: ""Sorry, we made a mistake. But here's a new DVD with all of the features for ONLY xx.xx$?I'd recommend to all of the fans: ""DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!"" Don't play into the hands of these big corporations!!!"
1,The Director's Cut is FOOL-SCREEN ONLY!!,"Yes it's true: the Widescreen 16:9 version on the new Disney DVD has the theatrical cut...MINUS When Love Is Gone...the song that Disney inexplicably cut out of the movie in theaters and so enraged Brian Henson that he made sure it was restored to EVERY video version of MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL...that is until now :(While the Widescreen 16:9 version gets the cut version, the Full-Screen Version is touted as the ""Extended Version with Deleted Scene!"" -- what a joke that Disney didn't get this right, giving the cropped pan-and-scan frame the version of the movie any real fan of the movie prefers to see.It truly, sadly, seems as if we're cursed to EVER getting a proper widescreen release of the correct Director's Cut of MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL -- because it's not on this new 2005 DVD, either!"
1,"Only part of the best movie ever made -- ""When Love is Gone"" was cut","This was no doubt one of the most brilliant movies ever made; it has become a Christmas tradition in our home. We eagerly awaited the arrival of the Blu-ray, playing it within a few hours of delivery. We enjoyed the clarity until the video skipped ""When Love is Gone."" That song so clearly defined Scrooge's life, and they threw it away. I don't know why they did it, but I'll hate Disney forever for doing it. This is like buying a copy of Meredith Wilson's The Music Man and discovering they left out ""You've Got Trouble."""
1,Missing Out,"I was so looking forward to owning this movie on Blu-ray so I could show my favorite Christmas movie to my children. Thankfully I read the reviews before I bought this. I am very disappointed that the song""When Love is Gone"" is not included. I will not be buying this DVD, as I still have a very tired version of my VHS tape with the movie in its entirety."
2,Muppet's Christmas Carol,"The movie was the same as the original, however it was cut to edit out a lot of the musicals that really make the movie. Very Disappointing..."
1,The Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary,"We were all very, very disappointed in this version. They removed our favorite scene and song When Love is Gone. Very poor decision by Disney!!"
2,Why it's not in widescreen,"Okay, Many a folk has wondered why this long anticipated DVD is in fullscreen rather than widescreen. Here's my answer:In the original movie there were more scenes. For example, when scrooge is at his desk in the beginning and beaker and his budy come in, they are supposed to sing a song. The same with the Eagle when Scrooge goes to christmases past and is with the the eagle. These songs, along with other scenes, were omitted in the VHS edition which many have come to love because they forgot about the original songs.I suspect this is also why the soundtrack is amost impossible to find. I got it when the theatre version came out, but I haven't seen it since! Both of the deleted songs are on the tape though!Hopefully the execs will get their heads on straight and release a good DVD, otherwise I recommend sticking with the video until other notice!Although I gave the DVD 2-stars, the movie in itself if a muppet classic and very good!"
3,Beware of download capabilities,I purchased this to show at school but it would not play due play due to the district Internet filters. I thought I could download it to my Mac but when I tried I got a message that it was not possible to download to macs. I was disappointed because I never considered this would be an issue and had already purchased the movie at that point.
3,Unhappy with Disney song cut,"I am very disappointed that ""When Love is Gone"" was cut from The Muppet Christmas Carol. This is one of the movies I grew up with, and I feel it expresses the importance of paying attention to your loved ones before you lose them to time (IE, he postpones the wedding to keep advancing his career). I've always liked Jim Hensen movies, and I'm fond of a lot of Disney movies as well, but the decision to cut a song about a break up as ""too sad"" seems a bit harsh, considering the fact that they put songs about murder and other cold themes in their villain songs (which are always very catchy - ""Be Prepared"" in The Lion King).I believe that the UNcut version of this movie is 5 of 5 stars. I'll locate an edition with the song in it."
5,A must have for the Season,"I have about 6 different versions of a Christmas Carol, and this ranks as my second favorite. I also have all the Muppet movies."
4,Hard to go wrong with Muppets,"Michael Caine is great, and it's hard to go wrong with the Muppets. An entertaining version of the Christmas Carol, good for kids and with catchy music."
3,Missing Favorite Song,"I love this movie, with a great script, outstanding performances (Michael Caine does a brilliant job playing it straight), and wonderful songs. Unfortunately, a song that made it onto the old VHS version isn't here: ""When Love Is Gone"" (it's sung over the end credits, but not in the movie itself). How can a Blu-Ray edition not include this song, at least as an extra? Frankly, it makes me Scroogey: I'd wait until Christmas Eve, then fire the idiot executive who made this decision."
2,Song Cut Means No Purchase By Me,"I can not believe the stupidity of Disney in cutting Whan Love Is Gone from this otherwise great movie. I own every previous version of this movie and it was irritating that my family could not watch the movie in wide screen with the full content of the standard version. I had been waiting to buy the Blu-Ray version knowing they couldn't possibly make this mistake again. Well I guess I should have known watching Disney's actions of the recent past that they would fail once again.In my case the butchering of the movie means though I have bought all the other versions I will pass on this one. It's a shame that they have blown it again. If they ever put the movie back together in Blu-Ray I will purchase it, but until then I will put up with the butchered wide screen DVD that I already own."
3,Missing a very important piece!!!!,"I have the VHS version of this movie and it is my personal favorite!! I just watched my newly purchased Blu-ray copy and was highly upset by the fact that they cut the song ""When Love is Gone"" from the Blu-ray! Why in the world would they do this??!!!!!!! I would never have bought it had I known this!!!! I want my money back and I will go back to my VHS version.Not a happy customer!"
3,"Love Muppets, but this version is not right","I love this movie, but when I watched it, there was a very important scene edited out of this version and I am very upset. I would return it if I could and get another version. The scene that is missing is a musical number when Scrooge and his girlfriend part ways during the Ghost of Christmas Past's visit."
3,Disappointed,"Loving this version of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" after seeing it in the theatre, I bought the VHS version (which I would give 5 stars) several years ago and watched it every Christmas. This year I decided I would update and add it to my DVD collection. For those who saw it in the theatre and later on tape, you may have noticed an entire scene/song missing. When the young Ebenezer is discussing marriage plans with his future bride Belle, she decides to leave and sings The Love is Gone. Michael Caine sings a duet with here during the second part of the song. This scene has been removed. Belle just simply gets up and walks away. This was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. I'm curious to know why it was removed. Not for copyright reasons because the song is sung during the credits. For those of you who have the VHS version, stick with that version. It's complete."
3,Missing material you assumed would be included!,"Yup, shoulda read the reviews- this is NOT the version you remember form TV as a kid. But apparently that version doesn't exist. Bummer."
2,"DVD NOT IN WIDESCREEN, Disney should be ashamed!!","This film is one of the Christmas classics and a favorite of our whole family's. The film deserves ""5-stars."" However, Disney chose to release ""pan-and-scan"" only for the DVD. Since pan-and-scan chops off the sides so that the movie is the same aspect ratio as a standard TV, we're only seeing half of the film. Therefore, I can give this ""VHS with chapter stops"" version of the film no more than two stars.Disney should be ashamed of themselves, ... ruining such a wonderful film with a sub-par DVD release. I was really looking forward to seeing this film as it was seen in the theaters (i.e. in WIDESCREEN). Maybe another year.Perhaps Disney is letting art imitate life. Perhaps, ... just perhaps, ... they will turn over a new leaf like Ebeneezer Scrooge and start releasing films in their Original Aspect Ratio!!We can only dream."
3,Disney....I am waiting!!!!,"Dear Disney people who are in charge of making these crappy decisions,Don't pretend you can't hear all the people who are anxiously waiting on you to make the version of a widescreen as an un-cut version. What's so hard about an extra 2 minutes on the disc? I would have gladly traded the full-screen version for a wide-screen uncut. And I think, judging from everyone else's feedback, that they would have preferred that also. What exactly do you have against that song? It was good enough for the original release (thank goodness!) and so it should remain uncut now. I will not buy this DVD until it is, in fact, un-cut. So, I will patiently be waiting for a DVD version to be released, and meanwhile continue to watch my precious VHS.VERY unhappy with you, Disney!:("
1,I can't believe it,"I really can't believe it. I've waited for so long for this DVD and now I know that it is a ""edited version"" of the original film. WHAT? I should buy a cutted version of the movie? Are you crazy? Selling this, Walt Disney is fooling us all. It's like to buy a ""Mona Lisa"" by Leonardo da Vinci with just the face and without the body, the hands and the mountains. I wonder what you guys had in mind. One of the most beautiful film ruined by someone without brain. They' ve even cut some scenes!!! I'm sorry for Amazon, but I hope nobody will buy this dvd until the Disney band will reflect on their deeds and their sins. And this is even a special edition, yeah, a special trick. And someone still wonder why people keep downloading the films in internet..."
1,"Excellent movie, awful DVD","This movie is a classic. A cherished Christmas tradition at my house. You can always rely on the Muppets for some entertainment, but this is one of the best. Now, you would think such a classic would get decent DVD treatment, right? Wrong. Disney has decided to release this movie edited. That's right -- 25% of the picture is cut off from the sides to fit a standard television. If only the correct Widescreen version had been offered. Forget about black bars -- with widescreen, you can see a movie the way it was meant to be seen!"
1,No Widescreen Transfer!,"I am very disapointed with this dvd and also Muppet Treasure Island...both of which Disney chose not to release in widescreen at all. These are Full Screen only movies in their current DVD form. I can just watch the VHS copies I ahve if I wanted Full Screen. The other Muppet movies published by Columbia/Tristar contain both widescreen and full screen, so I don't know why these are not in widescreen. I will hold out on buying them until they are, however."
1,Very Sad that this Version is Edited,"I have to say that I am very sad hearing that this new release to Blu-Ray is Edited and the song ""When Love is Gone"" is still missing. I am very Thankful that I have the Widescreen Complete Version from Laser Disc to watch every year. What I don't understand is why Disney chose to edit this movie? It's a Great movie with the full version that the Henson's made so many years ago. Make it right and then maybe I will buy it. No thanks, Disney keep your edited version. Very sad :("
4,"""The Love is Gone"" is missing","My all time favorite Christmas movie, butsong ""The Love is Gone"" is missing in blu-rayversion. What's up with that?[[ASIN:B008NB0SQO The Muppet Christmas Carol (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray)I have purchased from Amazon.com"
3,Not the full Movie,"The picture is great. The sound is great. If you were hoping to get the full movie with the song ""When Love Is Gone"" to bad Disney did not include it. It is not even included in the extras of deleted Scenes of which there are none. My guess is they might release an extended cut later so they can double dip. For now I will have to watch my Lazer Disc to see the whole movie. If I had known this was going to be edited I would not have bought it. My recommendation is to just buy an old DVD of the movie, it includes the song in the pan & scan version."
3,Where is the 'missing song;?,I love this movie. So where is the song 'When love has gone' which Belle sings to a young scrooge which was in the video and film version. I bought my DVD in England so is the American version any different? Some of the customer reviews only mention that the film is in pan and scan and not widescreen but never that a song is missing. Is then the UK version different from the American? Has anybody any answers? By the way I would love to give this film 5 stars but my DVD copy only merits three stars!
1,Won't be buying,"It seems from the reviews that this is the cut version without ""Love is gone."" I see no point in buying until the full movie is out on Blu-ray."
1,Sorry Muppets...,"The original uncut version is my favorite Christmas movie, but like the others here I have to join the cause. I am not buying the blu ray version unless it is the original version."
1,Very Disappointed,"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased the Blu Ray edition of this movie. Muppets Christmas Carol has been one of my family's favorite holiday movies since it was first released on VHS. We have never seen the movie without ""When Love Is Gone"" and did not even know the theatrical release did not include this song until the invention of imdb many years later. I understand that song could seem ""boring"" to some children, so why not have the option to watch the movie with or without that scene? Like so many other movies with extended editions and deleted scenes included on the blu ray? The pacing of the ghost of Christmas past just seems so short without that song included and the scene seems to end so abruptly.In conclusion I probably would have been just as happy with my pan and scan DVD version because the better resolution doesnt make up for the fact that ""When Love Is Gone"" is missing."
5,One of the Best,Watching this movie is a Christmas Eve tradition in our home. The Muppets have taken a Christmas classic and turned it into an excellent movie for all ages. This is a must have for anyone who loves the story of The Christmas Carol.
5,Perfect introduction for young children!,"This version is delightfully amusing in the details of the performance, the music is well done for the most part, and the light-hearted attitude makes this a perfect introduction to teh classic for young children. Some of the original language, particularly stunning metaphors and descriptions, is maintained; and some information about the author and book is also included in the movie itself- and it ends with a urging to read the book! The extras on teh DVD are fun, too."
4,Family Fun Muppet Style,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it in theaters when I was little. It one of those things where it's just not Christmas without it. I will note however, I only gave this movie four stars and was very sad to do this but I felt I had no choice. For anyone who can remember the movie from the theaters or VHS you will notice a song has been cut out. I knew about this before purchasing the film (the film-makers no longer owned the rights to the song is what I heard) and it wasn't the best song in the movie (when Scrooge's girlfriend is breaking up with him, the song name is ""When love is gone"") but it is still missed. On the whole though, still a great movie."
5,A childhood favorite that never gets old,"This movie has been one of my favorites since I was a little kid. It is sweet, endearing, funny, and just generally fantastic.The story is the classic Christmas Carol: Scrooge is a mean miser, and one Christmas three ghosts appear to teach him a lesson.Cliche as it may sound, this is one of those rare movies that is ""fun for the whole family""; my brother and I watch it every year, and still love it even at our advanced ages. :-)"
2,terrible shipping,"still haven't received this item. I know its awesome but I'd really like to get it someday. Until then, two stars."
1,Poor,The movie was obiously previously viewed as it had spots where it would freeze and cut off. I was very disappointed.
3,Bah . . . Humbug,"Muppet lovers will, no doubt, adore it. But fans of Dickens brilliant original dialogue and characters are apt to be disappointed."
5,This is what Muppet movies are about!,"Awesome movie!Count on the Muppets to take a classic take and give it that ever-so-gentle twist that allows Gonzo to narrate, Rats to be accountants, and Miss Piggy to be Mrs. Cratchett.Michael Caine does, as you would expect, an outstanding job as Scrooge. He completely loses himself in the acting and there's none of the ""Gee, I'm doing this with Muppets"" feel you get with other actors in other Muppet movies.Highly recommended."
4,Best Muppets Ever,"The movie is as beautiful, funny, clever and emotional as the first time we watched it. The DVD is like watching the original VHS version wich has some intentional softening of the images. It does not appear to have been re-mastered or enhanced. It is flawless throughout with the benefits of digital sound. It is now secure from VHS degredation and will re-surface every XMas."
4,Beautiful in Blu-Ray! Scene Still Missing!,"Only one DVD release gives you the option of watching the theater version (in widescreen) or the directors cut (in full screen) -which includes the song ""When Love is Gone"". While I understand the theatrical version did not include this song and this is considered the original movie, many of us who had it on VHS or had the other DVD got used to the ""When Love is Gone"" version and enjoyed it. Kids may not like it, but most adults do. Mind you, the sound and picture on Blu-Ray will blow you away, but I would have liked the option to watch it either with or without the cut scene. As far as I can tell, the scene is not even in the special features. I hope they will re-release this in the future with both versions for die hard fans such as myself."
5,item as described,Movie arrived on time and was as described. Story is suitable for all ages and types of children (and adults). Nice holiday/ Christmas themed story.
3,Movie is great - BluRay has issues,The movie is great. The BluRay has operational issues. The movie will only play from the preview menu (not from the disc menu). The disc also shipped with a bad activation code for portable play.
2,"Good times...but nothing to ""write"" home about",Loved the smell!!! The honey dust and feather...wonderful. The oil didnt warm as expected =O(. The stimulant oil was not so great. I like warming sensations over cool minty ones.
4,A lovingly told vivid memoir of a colorful family.,"Jerre Mangione's writing is so vivid that reading it brought back my childhood years in the 20's and 30's. His Mt Allegro (NY) was my Silver Lake (NJ). His parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, neighbors were mine with similar names. His family gatherings were mine, too. In this land of immigrants, each era has its own stories of growing up in America. Mangione tells his with the greatest affection, bitter-sweet nostalgia, and tender humor. Recently,I gave a copy of Mt Allegro to my Aunt Angie for her 87th birthday. She plans to pass it along to her older sisters."
5,"Review of ""Mount Allegro""",I really enjoyed reading this book. I had to review it for a seminar in grad school. It reminded me of stories I have heard from my Italian grandmother.A wonderful read for anyone with Italian roots!
4,Wonderful recollection!,"A great book on an old Italian neighborhood, now long gone, in Rochester, NY. I loved it & I'm not even from Rochester. It truly is a universal story. Enjoy!!"
5,"Best Game for Game Boy, in Fun and Graphic","This Game is the greatest!With real time function, and if parents say it is only fighting,(which is not brutal at all)they are wrong, because besides fighting you have to solve puzzles find the right time to catch Pokemon, have strategies for using items to make the time you have playing easier. The trainers you'll fight are much tougher and instead of getting only 8 badges you have to colect 16 badges, and really train you're Pokemon,because the strongest trainer has a Pikachu:81,an Espeon:73,Snorlax:75,Blastoise,Venusaur,and Charizad:77."
5,THIS IS THE BEST GAME IN THE UNIVERSE AND I'M BEING SERIOUS,"For all you who believe everything you read Chikorita is not weak and useless untill it learns Body Slam Attack. Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile are the starter Pokemon. I think for a beginner trainer Totodile or Cyndaquil would be the best. Chikorita is a challange to handle, but when it learns Razor Leaf Attack it can beat just about anything. I would try and catch my first Pokemon before your starter learns it's third attack. Berries grow on trees and they grow back every day. It plays in real time. If you want to get nightime Pokemon and it's in the day change the time. Anyways it's a great game thank you Amazon!"
5,Outstanding game - well worth buying,We purchased this game to play on a Game Cube. Not a game boy.The game is very well done for a game of this vintage.Everyone who played it enjoyed it.Buy this for the game play - not for the graphics.
1,Come on,"At first, the package was sent to the wrong address. I sorted that at on my own. Next I get the game and find out it wont hold a saved game. I can play for an hour, save it, and turn it off, then in an hour the save is gone!! Really disappointed"
3,Not bad,"Easy to play and to understand. As an RPG for kids is easy to guide the main character into battles and puzzles. No troubles playing the game, but its lasting apeal does not last long, and the songs get annoying. Over all great game could've been better. Great for Kids"
2,A Mistake,"This game was a mistake, yeah sure there are new pokemon and some new features like the watch and backpack and cell but after that don't expect much. This game might go under the RPG catagory but if it did it would be an insult to the catagory. This might suit a 4-11 YEAR old but not older then that. Real gamers and hardcore RPG gamers would think that the level of diffulculty in this game is a joke. This first game was an pretty good RPG only because it was a kind of new thing but the theme in a sense of a video game got old fast. I'm not sayin that pokemon got old and boring, heck you coul put the word pokemon on anything from underware to breakfast cerial and it would be on every kids christmas list. What i'm trying to say is that the GAME theme got old and this is just a facy re-hash"
1,"Parents, this is EVIL! Please don't by it!",This game is evil! Pokemon promotes fighting and violence! Look at the pokemon! They are demons! The pokemon cards have swasticas on them! Think before you buy! Pokemon is Satanic!
5,A GREAT Game,This game is awesome. I know for I have already beat the Japanese game. There are hundreds of new Pokemon and the graphics are way better. The music has also been redone! This is a must have for anyone who has a gameboy. It is worth buying one even just for this the breeding and hatching of Pokemon is just too cool!!! Togepi is the best! Choose the fire pokemon and try to catch a hoothoot! Good Luck!
5,"A superb, thrilling game with crisp graphics and sound.","I just got this game, and I love it! A new feature is added to the menu, Pokégear. At first you only have a map and cell phone. But if you answer all the answers to the quiz in the radio tower (in Goldenrod City), the girl will give you a radio card to put in your Pokégear. You use it to get local radio station. Hint: if you go back to the Ruins of Alph and turn on your radio, keep looking untill you get a radio station marked ?????? it plays really odd music. There is much more to see. Overall I give this game a pefect 10!"
1,Worthless,"Well to start..there was some very sticky residue on the back of the game. Then I inserted the game and played like 10 min to see how it all worked. Saved the game and cut it back on...did not save my game...Fail.Proceeded to try and save multiple times after, worked once, but when I cut off and on again disappeared. I am getting a refund and would not recommend buying games from here."
2,Does not save,This game was surely not cleaned and tested. I now have to return it and buy a new one. Will not buy from again. I have read some of the other reviews and it seems most of the games bought are likely defective or not as it seems. BUYERS BEWARE!!
1,Sad sad sad,The game didn't save. So basically just paid over 30 dollars to play the beginning of the game everytime I turned it on. Guy ripped me off.
5,Pokemon Silver,Pokemon Silver is a really cool game. You can get a Lugia on this game! Hurry up and buy this AWESOME game!!!!!!!
5,i love this game!!!!!!!!,in the game i chose cyndaquil as my starter and then mangege to catch chinchou totally easy!!!
3,eh...,"This game is a giant leap from the other game boy pokemon games. Everything in Red and Blue are twice as better in this sequel. Now you can get 16 badges and like twice as much pokemon as Red and Blue. This game is a little harder, three times as long, and more fun. You can do more things like breed pokemon, travel from one region to another, get on the boat as long as you want, and lots of other stuff."
5,The omega silver review,"yes finally silver is going to be out. this game has interesting features. In this game you can breed pokemon tho create new vreatures. you cannot do this with serebi zapdos mewtwo etc. this mystics. you can create pichu baby pikachu pi or baby clefairy. there is also a day night thing where during the night you meet different oeople and catch different pokemon. also the pictures of everything bushes,trees,building even pokemon. you will enjoy this"
5,An A+ Game,"Pokemon Silver is yet another great Pokemon game!In this game there are many things to do for enjoyment, Gym Battles, Catching Pokemon, Bug Catching Contests, challenging the Elite 4, and much more!Also, the game has a great variety of music that is sure to please.This game is a must for all gamers!"
5,POKEMON SILVER IS COOL!!,"Pokemon Silver is a challenging game. It is much more difficult than Yellow, Blue or Red. You can use alot of different objects to advance in the game. There are tons of new Pokemon to catch. This game is by far the best Pokemon Gameboy game I have ever played. I expect that Gold is as good as Silver. Silver deserves top rating."
5,Great Game,There are 8 new Gym leaders.Gary is not your rival. he is the Virdian Gym leader. Your new rival is meaner than Gary. You can breed your pokemon. This game lets you travel at night.
1,Broken,"The game was broken when I received it. The owner obviously knew of the problems with the game, but sold it anyways."
4,longer and better,"this is a great new pokemon game!! more pokemon!! more trainers!!new tms!!much better graphics!! if u loved red,bloo,and yellobuy this now!!!!"
3,Not too good...,"I love Pokemon and I bought the Gameboy Color as soon as I could. I first bought Pokemon Blue and later my mom's friend gave me Pokemon Silver. Since Pokemon Blue [wasn't great], I was really excited about Silver, but later I found that it wasn't much better. Here are some pluses and minuses of the game:PLUSES:-1)Full Color2)Graphics improved from Blue.3)Language improved from Blue.4)Johto is more interesting with different places and different people.MINUSES:-1)You can never see your Pokemon fighting.2)You can't choose to be a boy or a girl.3)You're always doing things for others and running errands.4)The Pokemon cries aren't very good.5)You have a limitation of six Pokemon, which is a nuisance.6)You only get great balls and all after a long time.My advice is: buy Pokemon Crystal or don't buy any, 'cause it's not worth the money!"
5,Pokemon Silver is the Best Game!,"In Pokemon Silver you will start with either Chikorita (#152), Cyndaquil (#155), or Totodile (#158). Some people say the Chikorita learns Razor Leaf at level 8! In Pokemon Silver you will be able to breed and mutate pokemon!"
5,buy it now and save your soul,this game is way better than rb and y the original game being included is great why is proffessor now living with a strange little man?
3,good game though problem,"the game is fine, only thing is i received the game and the internal battery had run dry so basically i cant save i think a fast trip to play n trade or game stop should solve that but still a bit of a pain so watch out if your buying it used."
1,Does Not Work,"Don't get me wrong, from what I played, it was actually a really nice game. Every time I turned it off and then on though, ready to continue on with my game, it wasn't there. For some reason, the game won't save. I was really looking forward to playing this, too. It's such a huge disappointment."
2,Game's battery was dead.,"Game's battery was dead. Rendering the game unsaveable until repaired. Thus, any repairs will lower the authenticity of the game and lower it's deemed rating. This is not to say that my item was not an exception. Other products from seller may be just fine."
1,Did not work,"I got the game and i was very excited to play pokemon after 12 years but, one issue it said it would save and it didnt, I saved it and played 2 minutes after the save and turned off my Game boy advance sp (brand new gameboy) I took it to my brother who fixes games for a living and he said that this game was broken and couldnt be fixed unless you buy a batterie and get lucky. I even tried the quitip with cleaning solution trick and it saved once but when i hit continue it said it was corrupted! so i gave it a achohol bath and still it didnt work. I suggest not buying anything from this seller, Hes probably some 9 year old because i could barely read the envolope, I wish that people like this seller could be put in jail.So much for reliving my childhood."
5,Beautiful Book,"After watching Victorian Farm, I was interested to see that the Book of the Farm was available after watching them refer to it so often. The book is beautifully done, with lovely illustrations. Alex Langlands has done a wonderful job of editing the book and bringing it to a new generation. Note that this is not the previously reviewed Kindle edition, it is new hardcover updated book."
5,I loved it!!!,"What can I say about such a fantastic musical, one of the few films I can watch over and over back to back and never get bored"
5,Music Man Magic,"I purchased this Cd for my young daughter. She had heard it at a friend's and really liked it.The CD is a little dated in terms of when it first came out and many of the people featured on it would probably not be known by many these days, but she really loves it and plays it all the time.If you remember the Music Man and enjoyed it then this CD is great buy."
4,The Music Man,"Watched it in one sitting, and found it most interesting. It was great seeing Robert Preston at a younger age acting and singing. Extremely entertaining for family as well as children. I am a senior citizen and choosy about the movies I watch. This one will be watched many times by my friends and me."
4,Poor sound mars this otherwise fine recording,"If you can get past that flat ""boxy"" Warner Bros soundstage sound, this is a highly enjoyable performance.The movie of THE MUSIC MAN was faithful to the script and score of the 1957 Broadway hit. The only major change was replacing ""My White Knight"" with ""Being in love"" (which nonetheless retains the middle portion of ""My White Knight."")Robert Preston, Pert Kelton and The Buffalo Bills were retained from the Broadway production with Shirley Jones, Buddy Hackett and young Ron Howard filling out the other roles.Warner Bros. soundtrack album has all the songs, in the order they were performed in the film.The original Broadway cast album (on Angel) does have better sound, and Barbara Cook, so it is preferable but since more people know the movie many will want this movie soundtrack CD."
5,Wonderfully nostalgic,"I purchased this DVD because I have been cast as Mrs. Paroo in a local production of ""Music Man"" and wanted to re-acquaint myself with it. I had forgotten that Hollywood was capable of creating something so entertaining and free of sex, violence, and dirty words. It was so refreshing."
4,"""The Music Man"" Rules!","I think ""The Music Man"" is one of the best ever written! It is definetely one of my favorites! I like every song from ""Rock Island"" to the last ""76 Trombones"". Oh....at my school we are doing this play. I just know it will be as great a success as our production of ""Annie"" went last year! So, all in all, this is absolutely wonderful! :-)"
3,The Music Man,We had the original soundtrack when I was growing up. This was exactly the same - without the scratches and family chatter in the background! Great quality and price.
5,The Music Man,Robert Preston's version of The Music Man is the ONLY version - Matthew Broderick is NOT the Music Man!!!
5,The Music Man,"Nothing could be more representative of the time in America where musicals were alive and well. Following such productions as Oklahoma, Westside Story and many others, The Music Man is unique, a premiere view of a distant past in America where a traveling salesman was uniuqe, entertaining and almost heaven sent, delivering a message from an outside world rarely known by the folks of places such as ""River City."" It is indeed a classic !"
3,Summary of Musicls,"From beginning till the end no weak songs,it is entertainment unto follow until the end,ther are not much musical how can say that.Enough songs for not losing the story,good start for overture to simultous getting over in the story itselfs."
4,"One of the best musicals ever, but poor sound quality","Meredith Willson wrote a true masterpiece with this musical. It is, and has been one of my top three favorite movies (not just musicals) of all time. I love the story and the music is wonderful. This would be the perfect cd but for one thing: the sound quality. The main problem is not the balancing, that can be tweaked on your stereo. My complaint is that there is a constant hiss throughout many of the songs. It is worse than listening to a cassette tape at times. Its just dissappointing because I work in radio and I know there is technology to get rid of that hiss in less than ten minutes, and this musical deserves that attention. I am lucky enough to have that technology available so I can fix it for myself, but the studio should have fixed it before releasing the cd so I wouldn't have to."
4,Good CD but not studio edited as expected,"The music is fun but a bit ""raw"" sounding. I thought it was going to sound more studio edited like other soundtracks I own. I still enjoy the CD though. My kids enjoy it too."
5,Favorite Sound Track Ever,"My first copy of this album was my very first album with my very first monoraul hi-fi. After years of wear I replaced it with the stereo LP, and when that wore out I switched to this CD which captures the glorious sounds all over again. This is a masterpiece!"
3,Great Performances/ Painful Sound !!,"I don't fault the performances of Robert Preston, Shirley Jones, etc..... they're all great. My major complaint with this movie soundtrack is the harsh sound quality. There is too much treble and not enough balance in the mid to lower range. The result is a recording that is actually painful to the ears. I believe a much better remastering job is needed. Am I the only reviewer who noticed this? Beware."
3,I can't rate this CD because ...,I sent this as a gift to someone and never listened to this CD. I can't rate this CD because I didn't hear it.
4,Fantasy Island,When you can't take o for an answer or despise being rejected what do you? Well stalking is not one of them. This shows what an innocent word or action could do to a teenager from a grown person. Keep your comments to yourself or suffer the actions behind them.
2,Decent Thriller; Could Have Been Better,"When just reading the description of this film it seems almost like a play off the classic Lolita. In a way, it is, but never attempts to mirror it. If anything, The Crush is a much more modern piece which only contains only a taste of what a viewer would get from Lolita.It's certainly an interesting setup - Man moves into apartment, 14 year old girl takes an interest, man gets scared, bad things start happening. Beyond that though the movie itself isn't all that great. Aside from the character Adrienne (the young girl) everyone else is dull. Adrienne carries the movie and I found myself watching only to see what devious scheme was coming to fruition in her mind.Some people will probably find this to be an excellent film but there's certainly better in the genre. If you enjoyed The Crush and want something similar in theme check outPoison Ivyor evenFatal Attraction."
5,'The Crush' is an excellent thriller!,"As a die hard Alicia Silverstone fanatic, I bought 'The Crush' with high hopes. Although harrassed by the critics, a shocking discovery was placed on my hands: it's an excellent movie. Sexual obsession and childish innocence form as one, creating Darian (Silverstone). Nick (Elwes), realizing the harm headed his way when Darian reveals her ""crush"", gets caught up in a violent swirl of events that lead to the ultimate finale in which Silverstone's acting abilities shine through. 'The Crush' was no waste of cash and the movie cover is to DIE for! Those glasses...those pouting lips...that evil glare. For true excitement, rent 'The Crush' today."
3,Darian or Adrian?,"I just watched this recently and was shocked to find out they changed Alicia Silverstone's character's name in the movie and searched high and low to find out why. I found this bit of trivia at IMDB. In case you were wondering...""When ""The Crush"" was edited for TV, Alicia Silverstone's character's name changed from Darian to Adrian. Screenwriter Alan Shapiro had based the film on actual events that happened to him, and ended up being sued by the girl he wrote about, who had the same name as his ""fictional"" character!"""
4,Great debut by Alicia Silverstone!,"Contrary to what others have had to say about this movie I do not find the connection between this and Fatal Attraction. This movie involves a 14-year-old who has a crush on an older man. In Fatal Attraction Glenn Close is a grown woman who has a crush on a man. I felt this movie was much more exiciting and not as predictible as Fatal. Alicia Silverstone does a wonderful job as Adrian, and makes the viewer really want to label her a nut. If you enjoy a movie with some twists and turns and like Silverstone you will enjoy this. I felt the ending was a total surprise and not as predictible as other reviews have stated."
5,The Crush,"Great Fun! If I hadn't seen it on t.v., I never would have seen it anywhere else. I saw it while flipping through channels and was late to a meeting because I couldn't stop watching it, I had to see what was going to happen in the end."
2,What's the deal with her name?,"In the movie the girl's name is Darian. But when it's on TV they call her Adrian. You can tell their lips are saying Darian though. Why did they do that? I just thought that was weird. I mean is there some reason you can't say Darian on TV or something, or did they just decide they wanted to change her name."
3,one of the very few movies I'm choosing to keep my vhs copy of,"This DVD is a huge disappointment. It may seem nit-picky to some people, but the fact that the lead female character's name was changed from Darian on the VHS version of the movie to Adrian on the DVD really really bugged me. I saw absolutely no point in this change, and it made me decide that I would just keep this particular movie on VHS so that I could watch it as I remember it. 1 star for the DVD and 4 stars for the actual movie."
4,LOLITA SILVERSTONE,"If you haven't been sensitized already to the charms of Alicia Silverstone, imagine the effect this film must have had when it was first released. Some shots seem to be stolen almost drectly from Stanle Kubrick's ""Lolita"" such as thr heart shaped sunglasses, lounging in a bathing suit on the lawn and others.The film has generally not been given good reviews by the major reviewers, but imbd user commentators seem to take more kindly to it."
4,a scary sexy thriller with the shades of revese lolita.,A few titillating looks of a YOUNG stone cold fox (check out the scene in slomo as she walks down the hallway away from the bathroom if you know what I mean)and a story line to scare any man who is dating a woman under the age of 25.
3,"Not great, but watchable and enjoyable.","From the word go, THE CRUSH is an obvious retread of familiar FATAL ATTRACTION/SINGLE WHITE FEMALE hijinks. Still, it's not a bad movie, and it does have at least one thing going for it, the auspicious debut of beautiful and talented young Alicia Silverstone. As the disturbed Lolita who menaces the attractive, but slightly dim-witted young man who moves into her family's guesthouse, Silverstone is truly radiant and believable every moment. I thought the ending of this movie was a little over-the-top, but otherwise it's a pretty good little thriller, owing mostly to the strong presence of Silverstone. Don't listen to those critics. Give it a try for yourself. You might find something that they don't!"
4,entertaining movie,"this movie is about a 14 year old who is obsessed with a 28 year old neighbour and stalks him and doesn't everything she can to manipulate him and the people around her just to get close to him. When he doesn't give her what she wanted and tried to stay away from her, she accused him of molestation and planted evidence because she was a sicko who was not getting the attention she desperately wanted. This movies show you just how easy it is to be manipulated by people who do things for selfish reassons"
1,I Never Received my Movie the Crush,i Was So Happy When Order This movie Cause I havent watched it in years & Now its Been Over 15 days & I have never received my item so i can not rate this item
2,A formula thriller that didn't really work,"Characters were stereotypes, situations were contrived unrealistically to serve the plot. There was enough mystery to pull me all of the way through the story, but in the end it really did rang flat."
3,kind of lame and a waste of time,"I got it for Alicia Silverstone. The actress who plays the male lead's girflriend does some interesting things and is rather charming.And the main lead? The male lead? The guy's name is Elwes, I believe. I only wish the director could have asked him to wipe that dumb grin from his face. Oh yeah, fake curls (over either eye) do not make actors(in their 30s) suddenly look to be in their 20s. This sort of thing gets to be annoying--and is witnessed (usually) in turkey flicks like this.As I said, the only real reason to see this is Alicia Silverstone, although, to be sure, she got better looking as she got older and matured as a woman.Got the DVD quite cheap--otherwise would have probably passed on it."
5,Great First Hand Account,"This is a short book and could be read in just an afternoon, yet it is also a great first person account of the war. Shaver does not try to glamorize the life of the soldiers. He mentions that they had no shoes or food in the winter, as well as the absolute misery of the trenches of Petersburg. He should know, because he was there, and the book does contain things that a former Confederate soldier might pine over-especially the idea of the ""Lost Cause"". It's obvious why he would be so heart broken though. He suffered in hopes of winning, but then lost, surrendering at Appamatox.For anyone interested in the history of the Civil War soldiers from Alabama, this is a must read."
2,Exactly what I expected...,"I love this display case...it was exactly what I wanted. It went perfectly with the Steelers helmet that I bought for my Fiance. It is very nice and exactly what they were advertising. He loves it very much. Also, very fast delivery, I ordered it on a Friday and it was at my front door that following Monday. I would definitley order this company again!"
4,Sitting In My Box,"This is a cute story about a young boy sitting in his box, and all the imaginary animals that come to visit him while reading. This book is a quick read with catchy wording so it is good for toddlers. It has great pictures of the animals which helps to keep small readers attention. This is a favorite among all the children at my son's daycare facility (1-2yrs). I would recommend this but beware....you may get tired of reading it over and over and over."
5,The best creative cards making book,This is a great creative book for making your own cards for every ocation. Simple directions for great success.
2,need lots of materials to make cards,I think that the book had lots of cute ideas but they all require lots of separate materials that I did not already have in my vast collection of cardmaking and scrapbooking supplies. You could use the basic ideas and modify them to make your own cards though.
1,Quick and clever handmade cards,I buy lots of books in Amazon. I would prefer to have the opportunity of see the book first before deciding to buy it. This book it is interesting and gives some techniques and tools that might help you doing handmade cards. But the ideas are basic.
2,Wish I Knew I was A British Book,The problem I had with this book was finding the supplies in it. The book is from England and most of the supplies are from companies over there. I finally found them on the internet but couldn't afford the shipping. Had to substitute every single thing so I didin't get the look I wanted on most of the cards.
4,Good show,"I bought this album together with Jason Becker's Perpetual Burn. After listening to both albums many many times, I can say that I like both albums equally. Dragons Kiss seems to have more consistently good songs and fresh musical ideas. Friedman is very good at building up musical tension in his solo's and he uses unique bends that are a trademark of his style. Perpetual burn is also a great album also but is great in its own way. I would recommend buying both of these albums just because they compliment each other. I would rate the combination of Dragon's Kiss and Perpetual Burn 5 stars, where individually I would rate them at 4 stars a peice."
4,One for the collection,"I just received this cd today, and I am very impressed with it. I got this cd after I heard Marty Friedman play the guitar solos with the Christian speed metal group, Tourniquet. I was impressed by his style of playing, and decided to get a few of his instrumental cds. This cd will no doubt be spinning in my headphones for some time to come. I give this cd a 4 1/2 stars, but they don't have the half option. Only because there were a few places in his songs that wasn't very catchy. But this is not one of those cds that you just skip over songs. So that outweighs the stuff I don't like. This cd is definitely worth getting getting."
5,Awesome,"Marty is a brilliant musician, and it shows on his solo debut. This album is good from the the first note to the last and has a few solos by Jason Becker (he also let Marty play a few solos on his debut album). This album isn't just a bunch of meedley meedley note cramming garbage that guitar players do to show off. Marty filled this album with awesome riffs and strong melodies sure to please any metal fan who can enjoy music without words."
3,Poor Quality for a flag,"only had the flag on the pole for 2 months and it shredded to bits. Not really made to be used as a REAL flag, just for show...what good is that?"
4,pretty good album 1st appearance of zoli,"my bad!!! i said zolis 1st appearance was call on my brothers but it is on this album. I remember when this album came out I was pretty surprised how it sounded compared with the previous album ""scarred for life"" at the time I thought ""wow these guys are really getting into the scene"" because bands like pennywise, strung out and lagwagon were hugely popular in the surf skate and whatever scene, now I just think they all kinda followed zolis lead. he seems to take the band in whatever direction he wants. the last ignte show i saw was an acoustic show at gallaghers in HB. pretty lame. this album though is good because is takes me back."
4,good sunscreen (for babies and adults!),"We've only had a couple opportunities to use the sunscreen on our infant (once at 4 months, another time at 7 months) and we kept her in the shade most of that time so it was hard to say just how effective it was. However, I can say that her skin did not react in any way and it had a pleasant smell.The real test was when her dad used the sunscreen one day (we had run out of adult sunscreen). He applied it once in the morning and was out in the sun all day (watching tennis) and did not burn at all. We were very impressed."
2,"Eczema, irritating",We have used this sunblock since my son was 3 months old and it worked well. But when he developed eczema this lotion made the problem worse. As soon as the sun screen hits my sons face a bad bright red rash appears. I've stopped using this product... While I am sure this is great for most people I want to make sure people are aware this may not be best for a child with eczema... We've had better luck with generic brands.
2,Sun screen,"This was just okay. I found it a little greasy, and it had to be applied way more frequently than I would have liked. I used it on my son and myself - I got burnt pretty bad."
1,Sunburn : (,This gave my 18 month old a sunburn. He was only outside for about an hour. I would not trust this product.
5,RELAXING LAVENDER BATH WASH,This stuff is great!! is non irritating to the skin and the lavender scent relaxes you while in the bath or shower. Highly recomend this brand and soap!!
4,the long story on short line railroads,The color photography is this book was truly great and I look forward to buying the rest of the series.
4,"Dramatic, violent pulp art in the spirit of Frank Frazetta!","Ken Kelly was a student of Frank Frazetta and it shows in Kelly's style of art. This 94 page book is an outstanding collection of violent pulp art depicting struggles to the death with serpents, fierce cats, grotesque monsters, and heavily muscled warriors. Of course the fair maiden in distress is also a frequent theme. If you love this kind of art then this book is highly recommended. The master, Frank Frazetta, also gives a nice two page introduction to Kelly's work."
4,Brilliant work,"Remarks:- Too many blank pages. In order to highlight each individual painting all the left-hand pages are clear of content.- The only information we get for each painting is the title. No year, real size, etc...SPECIFICS:Page Count: 96Number of images: 50Small images: 0Half page images: 5Full page images: 442-page spreads: 1BW images: 7TEXT:Foreword: 2 pagesIntroduction: 2 pagesART:13 images: 5 stars26 images: 4 stars11 images: 3 stars0 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 4 Stars"
1,Not ready for prime time,"Kelly advertizes himself as a ""student"" of Frank Frazetta, but he hasn't learned anything except how to imitate the master. Stiff, uninvolving, poorly designed, lifeless figures go through boring rehashes of Frazetta motifs. If a student showed me this work, I'd encourage him to keep going in the hope that he might eventually find his own style. He once did a Famous Monsters of Filmland cover that wasn't too bad, because he was copying from photographs. Boris is another one that has built a career scavenging from Frazetta, but at least he has slick craftmanship. Kelly is an incompetent draughtsman and his compositions are awkward. Did his family connections get him this book? Sorry to sound harsh, but this stuff is junior league."
2,Tragically Disappointing,"This cliff notes is very disappointing. To much analysis and not enough straight fact from starters. Also, as I perused it in 10th grade for my final exams, I wondered if Cliff and I had read the same book. The book is short..you're better off reading the book. At best, use it as a companion to the book."
4,the blues brothers are back? Well not exactly,"Aykroyd and Belushi are back, this time leaving the Blues Brothers to the side to bring us a fresh sound and look.If you like the Blues Brothers you will find this similar .It is fun american music sung by two guys who love to have fun with it. The band is tight and it is a great party CD."
1,3 words: Don't Be Silly,"Don't waste your precious time on Earth listening to these guys recycling great old tunes.Seek the originals, or at least, the definitive early versions.To wit:One listen to Have Love Will Travel by THE SONICS and you'll be muttering, BELUSHI WHO?This has been a public service announcement by the Better Living Through Good Music Council."
4,Better than you think,"OK, obviously they're not Pavarotti, but they're good. The're having a lot of fun and they love the music. That shows, and it elevates the quality of the music. This may not be a CD for a 'serious student' of the Blues, but it's fun party music."
4,Everything I wanted to know!,I have been looking for the information on prices for old collectable Gerber baby dolls for a long time. I just recently got on the internet and boom I found it with 5 min. Thank you
4,Great product at a great price.,"Best value for your money. I bought two of these batteries for my cordless phones, and both of them are working just fine."
4,Good Start on a new paranoral series,"The author got right to the meat of the story from page one and kept a brisk pace with the unfolding of the plot. Very engrossing. I will say this, the heroine is a bit too whiny at first, but I warmed up to her as the character developed. My only real complaint is that the 2nd characters were introduced rather fast and I kept getting them confused. Nevertheless, I will definitely read the next in the series."
1,Are we into bestiality now?!?,"I really don't know how to rate this book. It didn't feel like a book. The characters lacked character; they were creatures of some sort, shallow, in pursue of needs alone, and with no depth to speak of; they weren't silly or annoying, just nothing to write a review about. The story felt like an underdeveloped kids' tale that I have read or heard a thousand times before only without any meat in it (no pun intended): a beast is released from his jail after centuries, goes after his woman, abducts her, and they live happily ever after, gorged on each other's blood and sex. Actually, I don't think the author intended for the story to take up much space on the pages. It was just the setting for the bestial sex scenes, which were not erotic or shocking or remotely sensational, just... pawing and growling and blood sucking. Oh, and smashing walls and furniture along the way. Fine literature for discriminating readers. I understand why this book sells so well."
3,"oh,wolf , I thought you said vampire.","this is a book that would be good looking on the coffee table, I didn't really understand it."
5,best book of the year,"I just could not put this book down!!! I had about 5 other recent werewolf & vampire romances to read, BUT I just had to re-read this book 2x more before i moved on to the other book:) Great new line on Vampire romance!! AAA+++"
3,Good...but not Great.,I have to admit that I had a problem with the kidnapping and everything in the beginning of the book. I thought about just putting the book down then. However I finished reading and it got better. It took forever for main characters to make a connection. I did enjoy the climax of the book and how Lachlain's character evolved into the protective Alpha male that we all love.
4,Great book,This was a great story with great characters. I loved it and have been enjoying the entire series after reading this one. I haven't been able to put them down.
5,Great characters!,This book was a great read. I loved both the main characters and the supporting characters are fun and help led into their own stories.If you like Karen Marie Moning's highlanders you will enjoy this book as well.
5,WOW!!!,All I can say is .... who wouldn't want a very sexy Alpha werewolf chasing after you....LOL. LOVE this book!!!
5,Great Book,I really enjoyed reading this book. I have never read anything by the author before and descided to try something different and I'm glad I did. I read the book in a day becaseu I couldn't put it down. She kept you interested the entire book and came up with some very orginial characters. Now I want the whole series.
4,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I've repeatedly been drawn to this book based upon the reviews and how frequently it came up on listmania lists, but the painfully embarrassing cover was a huge deterrent. I am SO glad I finally swallowed my pride and gave it a chance! Unlike most other ""romance"" books I've read, this one was a fantastic mix of steamy tension and entertaining dialogue, and the characters (both primary and secondary) were GREAT! Loved it and I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series (even if all the covers ARE cheesy!)"
4,"Over the top, super-sexy and very enjoyable","I loved this book! Paranormal/supernatural stories are over-the-top by nature, of course, but this one was very well written. Kresley Cole does a great job of making you fall for these characters and to root for them. The suprenatural stuff is interesting (he's a werewolf, she's a half-valkyrie/half-vampire) but it isn't overdone and distracting. She also writes some fabulously hot sex scenes! It's also quite funny at times and very action packed in others. Check it out if you are into the whole shape-shifter/vampire/other-worldly creature romance stories. It is a fun, sexy, exciting read!"
5,Delish-delight-defabu!,"I was up until 2am trying to race to the end of this book....to say I was having a good time, is putting it mildly. Go, buy this book, you can thank me later...and you will, thank me, that is.Why are you still here, reading this review..GO BUY THIS BOOK!Were's, vamps, ghouls, demigods, witty banter, a hot guy, what more do you want?? Go, get out of here and spend some money."
1,THIS is romance?!?,"Perhaps I'm expecting too much from a romance novel, but I was very disappointed by this book.Lachlain nearly rapes Emmaline several different times. She flat out tells him that HE IS MAKING HER UNCOMFORTABLE. He doesn't leave her alone. He forces her into sexual situations that she is not comfortable with, and I DO NOT find this to be an appropriate and loving romance.He hates her because she's a vampire and he continues to tell her this. He insults her and her heritage. This has all the signs of an abusive relationship.THIS IS NOT an okay relationship to be presenting as ""good"" and ""romantic"". I'm sorry, but I cannot read anything else written by this author."
3,WELL WRITTEN FOR FANS OF THIS GENRE...,"A TOUCH OF SPOILER, SO BEWARE....I DON'T REALLY LIKE PLOT LINES THAT REDUCE WOMEN TO PRETTY PLAY THINGS; WHERE THEY ARE DOMINATED AND END UP LIKING IT. I THINK IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE TO OUR YOUNGER FEMALE GENERATION. A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY! BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT IS AN ENTERTAINING STORY AND DOES TURN OUT IN A BETTER LIGHT THAN IT STARTS... CERTAINLY KEEPS YOU GLUED. AND AFTER READING THE FIRST SHADES OF PUKE ME GREY, IT WAS AT LEAST INTELLIGENTLY WRITTEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS AUTHOR AS A 10 IN COMPARISON TO A 2 FOR GREY. ALSO, BEING THAT IT IS PARANORMAL IN NATURE AND UNMISTAKENLY A FANTASY ~ I DIDN'T FEEL QUITE AS GUILTY WITH THE MESSAGE.... OUR HEROINE ENDS UP TO BE QUITE THE KICK-ASS FEMME FETALE, SO THAT MADE ME FEEL A BIT BETTER.IF YOU ARE INTO EROTIC PARANORMAL ADVENTURES, THIS WILL DEFINITELY KEEP YOUR INTEREST."
5,Hungry for more,I have been seeing this series come up in comments on paranormal pages I subscribe to so I decided to give it a read. Wow! I was hooked from the first page! The characters were amazing! The story pacing was great (it was very hard to put this book down to go to bed) and I am absolutely looking forward to every book in this series! And anything else written by Kresley Cole!
3,Good Book - Kept me reading,I enjoyed this book - light entertainment after reading some heavy Sci-Fi recently! I will read more from this series.
4,A Page Turner!!!!,This book is a page turner!!! I just could not put it down. I enjoyed the story and look forward to the next book.
4,This book was fun,"This book was a guilty pleasure. Sure, it's not the greatest piece of literature ever written, but it was good. Exactly what I was looking for in this genre, sexy, interesting and made me want to read the next in the series."
4,Steamy Lycae,"I actually read the 3rd in the series first on accident, so I had to go back and read the first 2. I was no disappointed. Emma and Lachlain are extremely sexy together :)."
1,"Read books 2, 3 and 5","I have to agree with Erskine, Emma drove me nuts until I wondered why I was reading the book. By dumb luck I had bought the second book in the series, No Rest For The Wicked, and it WAS the best book of the series. My heart ultimately belongs to Cadeon Woede, he gets his own book, the fifth in the series. 2,3, and 5 are GREAT reads, but this one was mediocre."
2,Not going to buy the next one....,"If I wanted to read a book for the soul purpose of some good sex scenes, then I would have rated this book higher. However, I don't think good sex scenes alone makes a good book. I like to appreciate the characters (at least the main ones) and I simply did not. Lachlain was okay, I felt like I understood him, even if the Scottish accent was very distracting. My mind doesn't do a very good Scottish accent and he often sounded silly in my head... ya I know that is my own personal problem but it added to my difficultly in bringing these characters to life. I couldn't wrap my head around Emma... her characteristics seemed to change a few times while the book progressed and I never saw what brought these changes on. I hate being so vague on why I couldn't appreciate these characters but I don't know how else to explain that they just didn't jump off the page."
2,Definitely not the best vampire story,"When you read the book's prologue you'd think that you'll read a spooky book. So if you like eerie readings this could be it. The problem is that since the first chapter KC tried to make antic after jest and that only makes the book boring. If you really like to read a vampire love story, read ""Out of the Night"" by Robin T. Popp. That book has a really spooky love story."
2,"Disappointing, overrated, weak character, boring story...","I honestly don't understand why this book has so many 4-5 star reviews, because it was really yawn worthy, and the main female character was weak and foolish. 70 is plenty old enough to be wise, yet she was not. The plot line wasn't very appealing either, and there was a lack of ""good"" love scenes. I skipped many pages of boring dialogs between other characters because the back story just wasn't exciting.There are better romance authors out there, ones who actually put an interesting plot inside - please avoid this book."
4,Hunger Like No Other,The was a good story. A lot of twist and turns. It had a wonderful ending but it was not strong enough to pull me on to the next book.
5,One of the best paranormal romances I have read!,"A Hunger Like No Other(the first in the Immortals After Dark Series) was a fantastic read! The Alpha male leader of the Lykae, Lachlain, was one of the hottest alphas I have ever read. His instant hatred for his mate sets the reader up for great, uber hot sexual tension. I love the dominance of his character. He is a true alpha! And Emma, the shy and fearful female lead's transformation into a strong, sexy and capable half Valkrie is a smooth transition and fits into the story very nicely. I couldn't put this book down! It reminded me of when I began the BDB series!!"
4,A Hunger like no Other,"This is a nice change from just werewolves or vampires. This covers all the other's. With that said, I think there should have been another book before this one telling about how it all began. Each has their own stories, but they are still one family."
5,Good story about star-crossed lovers,"It's a good book that the author told really well, and I'll enjoy reading it numerous times"
3,Better than TV at least.,"Ok so the accent that Lachlain has is a bit much, and Emmaline is annoying. This book was ok. It's not as good as JR Ward, no one is though haha. It's better than watching TV though, at least there's some adventure and they finally do get together in the end. I know I didn't spoil it, that's what always happens."
4,Don't let the first chapter turn you off,"I had a little trouble with the first couple of chapters, the main male character is such a domineering alpha-male *&^% (insert expletive here). Once beyond that, I could not put this book down. I really enjoyed the Valkrye, Weres, and Vamps. If you like paranormal romance, you'll enjoy this one. If you like this one and haven't tried: Charlaine Harris or Kelly Armstrong you should."
3,O.K. but not great,"I bought this book based on all the excellent reviews it received. I have to say I was diappointed. Hardly any plot and a whole lotta sex. Well, almost sex for a long time than, finally, sex. If you like a book that is a big tease and not much on story than this is the book for you."
2,Too Uneven,"There's no question I'm a Kresley Cole fan - I loved her MacCarrick brothers Trilogy - If You Dare - If You Desire - If You Deceive, but this new series of ""A Hunger Like No Other"" just doesn't bring it into life for me. Obviously reading the many great reviews, I know I'm in the minority here, but although Lachlain is a sexy alpha male, something is missing from the other characters - no one seems to fill the page with any depth, or interest except for Lachlain. I can't help but remember being spellbound by Anne Rice's ""The Vampire LeStat"" series many years ago. All of the characters came to life on the page and worked their magic on you and you were drawn into a world of unknown mysteries. I loved Lachlain, but the rest of the characters felt like filler and not real characters. Let's hope Kresley Cole goes back to her Highland Warriors."
4,Never Judge A Book By It's Cover,"I really wasn't expecting to like this book. The cover itself screamed harlequin romance, which is not my type of book. And the first chapter or two really made me want to put it down. It was just so obvious that even though the two main characters should never fall in love that eventually they would kicking and screaming. But then I started ""yelling"" at Emma, ""Stop letting him push you around"", ""Your a VAMPIRE, fight back"". So then I had to keep reading just to see if she would ever find her ""voice"". And boy did she!!! All in all, I absolutely fell in love with the characters and will continue on with the series."
2,Disappointing start to a really fun series,"I read this book about 2 years ago after seeing this series compared to other paranormal series' I enjoy. After reading it, I had no desire to continue on with the rest of the books in the series. (Thank goodness on a whim I recently picked up the 2nd, No Rest for the Wicked - now I'm hooked). I just really didn't like the heroine and I found too many of the sex scenes forced (in more ways than one). It just didn't click for me at all. I realize (based on the reviews) I'm in the minority, but if you are like me and didn't care for this book give at least the 2nd in the series a try."
5,The book that started it all!,"Ahhh, this book is what started my current obsession with PNR novels. I was bored at work and so I looked up new things to read on Amazon. Read the chapter 1 teaser and was hooked.I love Lachlain and I love Emmaline. I thought both of their storylines were very authentic and honest. After I finished it I ran out and bought every Kresley Cole IAD book I could get my hot little hands on. That to me is a mark of a great story and an even greater author. After one book Kresley Cole had me chasing down the rest of the series at full price at B&N.; I even got Myst and Nikolai's book.She has created a fantastic world with AHLNO, one that I had never immersed myself in before and I'm loving it.I even like the cover."
3,Blahnikks,"Unfortunately I read the other two books in the series before breaking down to read this one. Although it was entertaining, it left much to be desired. Like another reviewer stated, ""it took forever for them to have sex""--and while that it not a deal breaker in and of itself, their continuous starting and stopping was."
3,A Hunger Like No Other,"Although I found this book to be enjoyable, it did not require or engage my entire attention. I was able to read it at work between calls and was able to keep up with what was happening. This book to me seemed to drag at times and at other times moved along. I am not yet certain if it is going to stay in my collection or be passed on. I have not yet started the second book in the series although I will read it and have purchased the third book. It just did not reach out and grab me."
1,I dinna ken what yer on about,"If you like some story with your book, this is not the book for you. This was just one long, dragged out will they won't they and I didn't really care if they ever would. I am not a big fan of the word 'shaft' and it appears far too many times in this book. Just for the record, being married to a Scot (albeit one who is not a werewolf like chap who has been burning for 150 years) I can confirm that they don't talk like the guy in the book.....who's name I have already forgotten. Fans of the BDB series would like this I'm sure (I thought that was just as bad), but if you fancy a good read, try Briggs, I Andrews, Mead or Frost. I've just recently read Chloe Neill and really enjoyed her books. This book was just bad."
2,Disappointing..,"After reading the fantastic reviews for this book I decided to order the first 4 books of this series. Although i can easily read a book this size in 1-3 days, I found myself struggling to finish it. The main guy Lachlain is a Lykae with a scottish accent which was extremely distracting to read. I couldn't hear that voice in my head and I found the style of talk with Emma and the other Valkyrie very cheesy. Emma seemed to have split personality jumping between wanting him and not wanting him only in the midst of a passionate scenes (which weren't that good either). The book also almost purely focuses on those two characters which makes for an even more boring read.It may be since I had just finished the black daggar brotherhood series that there was too much to compare as that series is fantastic. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because although I didn't enjoy it, at least I was able to finish it."
4,Excelente Historia,"Es un libro con una historia bien contada y personajes complejos y profundos.Me gustó como se desarrolló la trama, las sorpresas que daba la historia y como evolucionaron los personajes.Aunque soy una mujer adulta de mente abierta, me pareció que no necesitaba ser tan explicita sexualmente; no soy mojigata, ni mucho menos; y sé que mucha gente disfruta estas explicaciones detalladas, pero siento que muchos autores recurren a esto cuando la historia ""no da para más"" y este no es el caso.De todos modos la disfrute tanto. que buscaré m's libros de esta autora."
4,"Enchanting Hero in pursuit, but still not a perfect romance","This is my 1st paranormal read and skip the 1-3 series coz as many reviewer said this is best in the series. It's been long time since I try to find this book, and wondering is this book superb as other mentioned?As the fans of ""Twilight"" by Stephanie Meyer, I start to love story about vampire and werewolf. For me, at first this book have an exciting ""hero in pursuit"" kind of romance, which I adore the sensation. But sorry, after 3/4 of the book - the story is rather plain - without an interesting twist, and make me struggling to finish it.So for me the whole romance of this book is wonderful, however not ""that"" perfect or remarkable."
5,great,"just getting into this series. A quick, easy, and entertaining read. On the third book in the series now. A Hunger Like No Other is my favorite so far."
5,Optioned?!,"The energy of this novel! It's years after I first read this book and I still sit around thinking of how fun the trailer would be... option this whole series--get Joss and watch the millions roll in! This was the first novel I ever read that had the immediacy and diction of my every day interactions. Ms. Cole has stayed current linguistically speaking, enabling you to more closely relate to her non-human characters-- who seem all-too-human. Her multi-dimensional characterization is just one reason to enjoy these action-packed books."
5,I can't wait for more,"This is one of the most exciting sf/erotic/romance/horror books I've seen in a while. I'm constantly checking for the next in the series. Despite the potential to be stereotypes, vampire/valkyrie Emma and werewolf Lachlain are totally appealing and absolutely sexy together. The story is intricate, interesting, and funny!!! After being so disappointed by recent stuff by Hamilton, Feehan, and Kenyon, Kresley Cole is a breath of fresh air. More please!!!"
5,Great,"Being a fan of Paranomal Romance and ownly liking Christine Feehan, I thought I would try this author and this book. I loved it!! It was a fast sexy read and I would read any of Kresley Coles books( which I have)!!!I hope she keeps them coming!!!!!"
5,Awesome read,"I bought this romance book when it first came out and since then I have read it several times, it is worth the money and wait to have it shipped. If the rest of the series will be as well written as this one it will be a series worth purchasing. The story flows nicely and has a great ending, she brings all the loose ends together. This is the first in the ""The Immortals After Dark Series"". I hate it when you want to start reading a series and there's no way to tell which book is the first. This book is great, and it does have vampires, warewolfs and other creatures in it."
2,"Great in Theory, Disappointing in Execution","I enjoyed the concepts and ideas in the plot of this story. I felt the development and backstory was well-thought out. But when I finished the book, I knew I would never re-read it. It had a mary-sue/fanfiction after-taste with the very random video-watching scene. And there wasn't much depth to the conflict. Maybe it just needed more time in production or to have gone over one more proof-reader's desk. I'm glad I read it, and I did chuckle here and there, but that's about all I can say for it."
5,One of the best Paranormal romance books,"I've been through many of the paranormal romance series and this is one of the best. This is the first book in this series I have read and I am eager to delve deeper into the Lore. I will not be reading them in order but I am told that it doesn't matter much. I loved the characters and although Emma was a little weak for my tastes, I still liked her as the female lead. My library didn't have the prequel to this story but as soon as it becomes available, I am curious to find out what the deal with Emma is. Her Valkrie family protected her so much and I want to find out why. I would highly recommend this book."
4,Good read,"I really enjoyed this book. The author writes well and grabs your attention from the beginning of the book.There is no ""lag"" or boring parts in this book. I was enthralled from beginning to end and liked the personalchanges and developments the main characters made through out the book. All and all a great read and escape."
3,Cute Read,I enjoyed the beginning of this book and the quirky relationship the two main characters Emmaline & Lachlain have. I think the author could have gone without all of the different species - it a bit hard to follow and they're mentioned without explanations which throws you off. Other than that the heated romance is worth picking the book up to read. Definitely a tow curly ladies!
3,Forgetable at best...,Im not sure how this book has such a good rating. Other ratings online are more im tune with the quality of this book. While I did finish this book I found myself often bored and sometimes confused. The scenes jumped around a lot andleft me wondering how anyone wouldnt be left questioning the sequence of events. I feel cheated this definitely wasnt a book worthy of the ratings. Wish I could get my time and money back!
3,The Immortals After Dark Series,"After enduring years of torture from the vampire horde, Lachlain MacRieve, leader of the Lykae Clan, is enraged to find the predestined mate he's waited millennia for is vampire. But now he has scented her, his mate, the one woman for him alone. I love the way he Loves Emma,(his Emmaline) With all of his revenge and hate for Vampire's, he could have done her great harm, but he did not. I like the way, the story was written, I went out and got the next book(No Rest for the Wicked)."
5,"Sexy, exciting Paranormal Romance",I really loved this book. I found the characters were very well written and easy to relate to. Emmaline and Lachlain's romance was seductive yet sweet. It's a fast and easy read.
4,"light, fast read, fun & forget","Brooding man is irresistably drawn to shy woman, yet problems keep them apart. Classic plot, nicely done but not spectacular. This is a fun ""read & sell used"" book. The sample pages provide a good representation of the book. My biggest beef is that the leading lady is yet another vampire when the author has far more interesting human-variant race ideas."
4,Very good read!,"Even though I am a vampire aficionado, even I am beginning to get tired of the many, many vampire romance novels out there. But I picked this one up anyway, because it sounded a little different - and it was! Kresley Cole does a good job differentiating her world and characters from the other paranormal romance settings out there. Her characters are interesting and unique and you soon begin to care. I look forward to seeing other books in this series!"
3,Good read,"I liked this book, but it was a bit too long and drawn out for me. It lost my attention quite a few times. The ending was great. I just wish the entire book would have been as interesting as the ending."
5,As Good as BELIEVE!,"This is the best all-out fun, pop, dance song on the Living Proof CD. The gimmicks are abundant and lead to a vox box, electonica wonderland of eight rave worthy mixes. As a bonus you get two of the best re-mixes of The Music's No Good Without You , it's an awesome haunting mood piece of a dance classic."
1,The Cover Tells All,"I have not seen this picture, but I didn't need to. The incredible error on the cover tells me everything I needed to know about the quality of this production. The cover shows a reverse image of Chad Lowe playing guitar apparently left-handed, with a wedding ring on what would be his right hand. I'm amazed no one else mentioned this already. If the producers are this careless with their cover art, how careful -- and from other reviews they were apparently not careful at all -- could they have been with the facts?"
5,I loved this movie,I can't believe all the negative opinions on this movie.I watched it twice and enjoyed it very much.
2,So not right!,"I'm a huge fan of John Denver and I purchased this from Amazon almost two years ago. I was very excited to watch it, but as it started to unfold, I knew there were so many discrepencies of fact and the timeline of his songs with the events that happened were so off. I'm sure Chad Lowe could have done a much better job but maybe he was directed to act that way. I found the rest of the cast ok and Kristen Davis was the most believable. I so wanted it to be a wonderful movie about a wonderful man and entertainer. All I got from the movie was pretty bad acting and not a lot of correct information."
1,One Of The Worst!!!!,"I have to say I was extremely dissapointed in this made-for-tv movie on the life of John Denver. The acting was miserable and although I do like Chad Lowe, this was not the part for him. Gerald McRaney was nothing more than his ""Major Dad"" character and there was hardly any mention at all that John even had a brother. In addition, I stopped counting the number of mistakes and mis=information after the first 10 minutes! This was a real embarassement to the memory of this incredible human being and although we all appreciate any media coverage, this was one of the worst! Perhaps some lessons could be learned from the exceptionally beautiful tribute done by ESPN's Fly Fishing The World!!!"
1,"This ""biography"" is FICTION with BAD acting!","From the first minute of this so called biography, the facts have been tossed out the window. (They've got John singing ""This Old Guitar"" a full 10 years before he wrote it).The list of inaccuracies is too long to list here (anyone who only saw this Movie would be shocked to learn that John has a brother! and a manager named Jerry . . . and TALENT!)Hal Thau had a whole lot less to do with John's success than his manager Jerry Weintraub.Flying for me was written for the Challenger Crew in 1986, not before his father died in 1982.Geesh folks, how hard is it to check facts?John deserved far better.Note to Chad Lowe: John did not whine all the time and he did not writhe around on stage when he sang.The only thing mildly amusing about this abomination is the whle 14 seconds devoted to his second marriage.If you wanna know about John Denver, read his book, listen to his music, and watch The Wild Life Concert. THAT is John Denver."
1,Pass this one by,Chad Lowe's portrayal of John Denver comes off like a Saturday Night Live skit. The fake singing and phony guitar playing are very apparent. He is not believable as John Denver at all. He whine's throughout the movie. Kristen Davis is better but she can't save this disaster. This movie make's John Denver look like a total boob which he was not. Save your money on this one.
1,John Deserved Better,"This movie was an extremely poor attempt to chronicle the life of one of the world's foremost environmental/humanitarian educators of our time. John used his celebrity to further his beliefs and his passions and through his many admirers, those visions are being continued today. The inaccuracies are far to numerous to mention as well as mundane portrayal by Chad Lowe.If you want to see the REAL John Denver, I suggest you purchase ""Let This Be A Voice"" and/or ""John Denver: A Song's Best Friend."""
1,Take me Home (the john denver parody),"I recenty viewed this film, and the entire time I was waiting for something realistic to happen. John Denver is sadly portrayed as a whimpy fool, with no strength,brains, passion for nature or writting, and no integrity.I Think this film should have been called Annie's story, as Annie is shown as the strength behind, and dominator of his life. Not suprizing, considering the film was made after his death, and she was the chief consaultant. The film serves as a mockery of john Denver under the disguise of a dramatized biogaraphy.To sum the film up it was poorly casted, poorly directed, presumptuous, and produced in the style of a Lifetime original movie. It might be good for a some laughs at John's expense, if you don't mind throwing away some money."
1,Garbage,"Bad script. Bad acting. Bad directing. Bad production. Just plain bad.For anyone who thinks this piece of trash deserves one look, consider this:Would you want your life story told by a disgruntled ex-spouse and a liar accountant?"
4,"Nice, but could be better...","Overall, I'm pleased with the product. I keep it in a ziplock bag in my freezer and use it when I want to destress or shake off a killer headache. The material is soft, and the pac is just the right weight to put the perfect amount of pressure on my aching eyes. My only qualm is that it isn't as fragrant as I'd hoped it would be, and it's only getting less so (despite the fact that I always store it in a sealed bag, as indicated in the care instructions)."
3,Herbal eye pillow,"I like that it has a nice weight and soft cover, also the herbs inside smell good. But, in the picture on the website it shows that there is a cut out contour for around the nose, my eye pillow does not have this,it is just cut straight across... that is s little disappointing, as I think the ones with the nose contour stay in place better."
5,Charming..,"This is one of Shirley's best movies. Why it is not on DVD; I will never know.With Jack Haley, the Tin-Man from the Wizard of Oz.Little Shirley becomes separated and lost from her nanny in the big city; with a sinister, crook trailing her.Jack Haley is a poor, down on his luck entertainer, who is humorously and mercilessly needled by his wife, Alice Faye.Shot on some nice locations, especially the beautiful home.Humor, suspense, and some song and dance in an interesting story. Charming."
4,"compact, long lasting charger. batteries OK","we've had this charger for 5+ years and its still working. compact design and retractable electric power plug, fits well in luggage/purse/backpack.However it seems the Digipower batteries don't last as long as some others, but i haven't done scientific testing, just a feeling."
3,not bad but not good!,"Well it's been a while since i've seen corey feldman in anything except in the newpaper or on extra promoting his new reality show..oh yes..his forgettable guest appearance on ""Son of a beach"", but his acting in this flick was not half bad and without spoiling anything in the film (you gotta watch it for yourself)he just chose the wrong project but i guess anything that comes his way right now is cool with him (don't quote me on that!) If your in too a b-grade light comedy that won't take away too much time in your life..why not go for it (for corey's sake of course!)Note: What's up with the $99,00 price tag!!!"
3,Classic Neoclassic,"This album is difinitely on the required listening list for Neoclassical rock guitar history 101. A collaboration of two of the finest guitarists in the 80's shred scene, Speed Metal Symphony delivers the goods on hyperfast classically influenced guitar playing.Two tracks, ""Concerto"" and ""Speed Metal Symphony"" are instrumentals, and are also the highlights of the release. The lyric laden ""pop"" songs on this record just don't seem to have the same impact, although the guitar lead on ""Desert Island"" probably set the world speed shred record at the time. Speed Metal Symphony shows a ""Cacophony"" at their best in the extended instrumental form, as the title would suggest."
5,amazing.,"this is one of the best albums ive ever purchased. If you like neo classical music with some speed metal to it then you will LOVE this cd. Its the most intense album Ive ever listened to besides there next one which gets even better. If you like shred, or just beautiful calm music with great arpeggios bein sweeped over the rhythm then youl definetly love this amazin cd"
4,Wicked,"I would like to point out that MTV rocks is funny and you guys are suckers. This album does rule, just not as much as top40 radio hits."
4,MTV rocks is pulling yor leg,"This is a great first album for two exceptional guitarists. The song writing is a bit choppy and uneven at times but the solos are unreal. That sphincter MTV rocks is pulling your legs, as evidenced by his comment about Jason Becker being so lazy that he doesn't play guitar anymore. Becker has Lou Gehrig's disease and can't play guitar except through a special keyboard device and computer programs. An uncool comment by MTV sucks (oops!) rocks. The comment about Cobain is also clearly intended to provoke, since comparing these three guitarists is like comparing a steak and cheese sub to a filet mignon (everyone knows that Cobain was one of the sloppiest three-chord guitarists ever; I think he sucks for unleashing Courtney Love upon the world)"
5,An excellent conclusion to the triology!,"I loved the Winter King, enjoyed Enemy of God, (though I thought it was weaker), and looked forward to this final installment. It did not disappoint. I thought the events fell well, one conflict right after another. Derfel's new appreciation and respect for Guinevere and his continuing relationship with Ceinwyn were highlights.The battles were detailed and interesting. As always I enjoyed Merlin's wit and humor with Derfel and was moved by his sad end.I highly recommend the whole triology to any fan of Arthurian literature."
2,Just OK !,Not up to his usual standards. Seems like one weekend he thought it was time to write a new book. Beginning was very confusing and cluttered. Order was somewhat restored by the end but too many fictional names an places
5,Braveheart Does Camelot,Bernard Cornwell saved his best for last. Excalibur is one of the best Arthurian tales I've read. His attention to detail and explicit descriptions of battle scenes and everyday life give the reader a good feel for the times. It is easy to become attached to the narrator and I was saddened by the fact that the tale had to end. Highly recommended.
5,One of the Best,"I came to Amazon prepared to write a glowing review, deeming this book as perhaps the best book I've ever read. Imagine my surprise when I saw the previous two posts had the exact same words in them!Cornwell is a phenomenal writer. He takes the Arthurian legend in fantastic different ways. His depiction of the brutal warfare was breathtaking. I couldn't put this book down. A+ I hope we delves into this era of history again."
5,admist death and destruction love really does mend all wounds,"i cried when this novel ended, for the characters had been with me for three weeks. i read the trilogy straight through and the ending of the tale was like the ending of a friendship. derfel steals the show, his ever trustworthy nature, always making the right decision, and his ability to love above all else makes the characters drawn to him. druids, christians, battles, promises kept, promises broken, and peace in small measures. the women are the solice and problems both large and small."
5,Bernard Cornwell is a genius at this topic,"I have read every Bernard Cornwell book and for me this is the greatest. It captures every element of the Arthurian Legends and relates them in a brilliant fashion. I have read the Warlord Chronicles over and over again. They were brilliant to begin with and became outstanding. This is one of the best books I have ever read, the last chapter being one of the finest ever written. Both Sharpe and the Starbuck Chronicles were brilliant, but this is even better, Cornwell's ability to capture the readers imagination is outstanding and he manages to even convey Lancelot in a poor light."
5,Wonderful telling of the story everyone knows,"This book was great--as was the whole series. The characters were believable and human, and I found myself wishing there were more books."
3,I bet men like this book more than women do.,"I enjoyed the books, even though they were pretty dark, but I had a problem with the female characters. They were all repulsive, disloyal, sly, conniving, or stupid. All except for Ceinwyn, Derfel's woman. I think Cornwell is a little hard on the women in his series. Definitely more into battle scenes than love scenes, too. And I'm not saying read Mary Stewart. I think Jack Whyte got the mix about right with his Camulod Chronicles."
3,more gore than I need,"This is the only book of the trilogy that I've read. I'm intrigued by the story, but I can't bring myself to read other books in the same style. Lots of graphic fight scenes, blood and heads flying, knights gored or chopped up. Probably enjoyed by more men than women.I had to keep putting the book down because of the fight descriptions, but the story kept me coming back. The characters are more human than many other Arthurian tales, and that's what kept me reading until the end."
1,Not so Great,"Personally, i really disliked this book. I thought it was confusing (characters and places) and unclear about plot. It was also too wordy and drawn out (400+ pages). It didnt really catch my attention. After all, I had to read this book for a book report so that might have something to do with it. This would have been a mediocre book if you were into all that medival arthur stuff, which i really am not. So I wouldnt reccomend this to someone who likes a quick and easy read. Also it had a bit too much gore for my taste, so dont read it if you dont like bloody, graphic battle scenes."
3,"G-8-""THE SPIDER STAFFEL""","Former WW1 army pilot Robert J. Hogan started writing the G-8 series in 1933. The series ran sucessfully until WW2 shot it down in 1944.My brother brought home my first pulp magazine copy of G-8 in 1936. The cover was a fascinating one depicting a giant hand appearing out of a cloud clutching a doomed Spad, The title of that issue was ""The Cloud Crusher"". ""The Spider Staffel"" features another fantastic adventure of G-8 and his two buddies, soaring over enemy lines during ""The Great War"". Issue #13 of this new series is a fine example of lovingly recreating this old pulp magazine featuring a beautiful quality reproduction of the original front cover. For those of us who enjoy fantasy and nostalgia of a long gone era, ""G-8"" beckons!"
2,Not up to par,"I really liked the TV series, but this DVD has a lot of needless verbiage about gays that I found bordered on the vulgar. Some of my friends are gay and they do not speak or behave that way. Just not as good as the TV series. I would not buy it again."
1,Wrong Region,"Unfurtunately, I can't watch this DVD, because of the ""wrong region""-code. As soon as I enter the DVD into the Player, this message pops up."
3,review,not exactly what I expected. bought as Christmas presents. Never used a mouse pad so thin. As thin as two sheets of paper
4,wow pad,"Nice pad, but kind of expensive. Could have got a regular mouse pad but I wanted the one that has a picture slot in it. It's very thin but I'm ok with that. The edges is a little sharp and I wish the back has a stronger grip to it."
3,Part Finder Off on this one,"This item does NOT fit the 2009 Dodge Journey SE 2.4L. For that car, you will need the Pentius PAB10516."
4,Delicious brittle - - packaging needs work,"I love the brittle I get from Swiss Maid. It is delicious, crunchy and made with what are obviously high quality ingredients. The cashew crunch is ABSOLUTELY wonderful. I wish they did the same thing with almonds and/or peanuts or really any of the other nuts. I'm down in Texas so the time to receive my order seemed to be absurdly long. Though, I will admit, it is well worth the wait. I also would like to see Swiss Maid use a different type of packaging for their product. The ""brittle"" bags are so ""brittle"" they tend to ""crack"" open in the box. Even if they do not ""crack"" in the shipping process, they are not durable enough to store the product. This is peripheral detail that really needs a little work, but it is not going to prevent me form ordering more."
3,"Nice idea, but one problem","I have now tried two of these in less then a week. The problem is the power plug becomes very hot. Within a half-hour it is starting to get warm and within an hour it is extremely hot.I'm disappointed as I really wanted this to work out. It might just be a glitch with a few of them, and I just happened to get two of the bad ones."
4,love it,"It's so nice to have fresh water for my cat. It took him a bit to warm up to it, but now he drinks out of it just like he did with his normal bowl. It only gets loud when it needs more water which I like because I always know when to fill it."
4,In My Own Backyard,"I was so excited to be waiting for the mail delivery of this new installment of Ms Galenorn's Chinz and China series. How would this series progress...what characters would I get to know better; knowing already and feeling a part of the trio of women friends, yet wanting to evolve with the town into personal knowledge of more quirky folks. YES!! It came to pass, and so very entertainingly! Emerald and her psychic gifts were waiting, her children growing older and clearer in my mind as pages were turned. Her Native friend and partner Murray opening herself to her heritage from book to book slowly, as the blooming of a flower. The little old neighbors, the annoying newswoman,others who came into view and most of all, Jimbo. Ah, it felt like being home again! But nothing was more awe-inspiring than the insight into a most primal creature. Again, Yasmine has taken us deeper than the heart, if that can be done. Brava!!!"
4,Another Chintz in China classic,"Again, it's nice to see Galenorn's writing capacity and abilities increase. I love Emerald and Joe, and enjoy reading about Emerald's exploits, but the books definitely get better the later they were written."
2,More like dying embers,"The premise of this book--a wealthy stranger arrives in a Colonial New England town and then apparently bursts into flames--sounded intriguing. Sadly, it did not fulfill its promise. Absolutely nothing in this book ignited my imagination.To me, the characters seemed one-demensional and formulaic: the brave little widow, the potential love interest next door, the spoiled sister, etc. The period detail was generic and didn't give me a sense of ""being"" in 1763. The mystery itself, while not riveting, was interesting enough to get me to finish the book, but I won't be reading the sequels."
3,READ BEFORE YOU BUY,"I BOUGHT THIS PILLOW AND TRIED IT FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS. I FOUND IT BE UNSATISFACTORY. IF I WOULD HAVE READ THE RETURN POLICY, I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY. ONCE OPENED AND TRIED, THE PILLOW CANNOT BE RETURNED! IF WE CAN'T TRY IT, HOW CAN WE JUDGE IT'S USEFULNESS? PLUS, ALL YOU ARE ALLOW TO DO IS OPEN THE PACKAGE (CAREFULLY) AND PEEK INSIDE. THEY SAY IT IS UNLAWFUL TO RETURN PILLOWS. NONSENSE! LAST YEAR MY WIFE BOUGHT A PILLOW FROM MACY'S AND RETURNED WITH NO DIFFICULTY. BUY ELSEWHERE OR MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT INTEND TO RETURN THE ITEM. AS FAR AS THE PILLOW IS CONCERNED, IT'S JUST ANOTHER GIMMICK. THE TOP PART IS MUCH TOO SMALL TO BE EFFECTIVE."
3,Side sleeper pillow,"I was disappointed in this pillow as it wasn't the one advertised on TV, but that's my fault as I didn't check it out as I should have. I'm making it work. I really wanted the depression for my ear as I always have to sleep on my right side due to my shoulder and my hip pain. But, alas, I didn't look at the ""big"" picture."
3,I'll never tell--great books about WLS real people,"I don't know what book the previous reviewer read, but it bore no resemblance to this one. The characters here were very real, even though I don't like reading thrillers per se--I did like the WLS aspect. Maybe a bit detailed(ex. PCA device--and gave the explanation--that slowed the flow--But overall, I like the book."
2,disappointing,"this fm transmitter is halfway decent. there is alot of static and interference if someone driving by has their ipod on. i used it with my Griffin iTrip, which worked well. then when my iTrip broke and used this one alone, it was terrible. but it does charge. so basically, this thing is only good when used with another fm transmitter on top of your ipod mini."
3,Nice twist at the end for this one!,"The movie is your avarage atmospheric spookfest or so you think.. Until the end of the film. The director and writers throw a real nice curve ball at you. I won't tell you what it is just that it actually makes the film worth watching. Don't expect mass gore or monsters, that is not going to happen. This movie is pure mental. Also, watch the special features portion of the DVD, the background about the filming of the movie is just as entertaining. Apparently the set for the film is haunted and the enitre crew experienced the ghosts."
3,"Overall, a decent read","The author has stayed fairly true to the Piper tone, but the characters have lost some of the subtle depth that Piper was able to inject. Kalvin has become far more all-knowing than Piper would have allowed and the villains more black than white. Nonetheless, it was nice to revisit the worlds of Paratime!"
4,too much of a good thing,"being a fan of h beam piper i was delighted when the sequel ( the great king's war,kalvan 2) came out. not being in the loop i did not know of the other sequels until recently .i enjoyed kalvan 3 except for 2 problems i.e. the over expansion of characters and the lack of a paperback version.i guess the 21st cent. version is kindle.i'll save my money and perchase kalvan 4 soon, reluctently.9"
4,Nothing beats a good murder mystery/con game,"Part noir, very humid and sensual. I enjoyed this movie, Woodyplays the poor shumck Elizabeth Shue uses to murder her husband and get his money, only it not her husband, I don't want to spoil the plot, but it was well done. If you like twists and turns you'll enjoy this."
1,The movie itself was so-so,The movie was OK. It was a used copy and froze and would only advance one frame at a time in the last 20 minutes.
3,"""A Shue In""!","Harrelson's acting is stiff and slow...he needs a tougher director that would push him like the one he did for the life of Larry Flint. This film had the feel of an ""Off Braodway-Little Theater Group"" effort. The ladies made it pleasing to the eyes! CHEERS! A nice ""popcorn"" movie."
4,Shue Fetish!,"As sexy and slinky as she was in Leaving Las Vegas, Elizabeth Shue absolutely shines in Palmetto. It's the kind of stuff that film noir fans wait years for. Good direction and great performances make this one a hot little movie for these long cold nights."
2,You'll be disappointed,"This movie has the requisite moods and plot for a film noir. But what a lousy and unsatisfying ending. Also, it's a terrible waste of acting talent to cast Gina Gershon in the limited and tiring role of a faithful girlfriend."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!!!,"If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would have. Don't even bother watching this. Total waste of talent around here. Woody and Gina are just too good to be a movie like this."
5,Takes me to another time and place,"I just love this movie! I've read that they tried to make this movie seem like it was filmed in an imaginary 50's town. And that is probably my favorite thing about it. The mix of old and new. Woody Harrelsons hip but old style of clothing the desolate locations. I live in Florida, but I don't live in this Florida. I know it's just a movie but it's the kind of life and situation that every man would like to be in, at least every once in a while."
3,"Not bad,not great,but not bad;Harrelson leaves Cheers behind","For those who thought that Woody Harrelson could only play a dense barman on Cheers, they're in for a shock. The guy can halfway act. Harrelson has plenty of trouble(s) with three women in this movie. There's a lot of intrigue, suggestive sex, and other standard fare in this movie. The women are ok, though they are more suggestive than revealing, especially Shue; who, if she ever decides to get ""revealing"" in a movie has a pretty decent body for it, as well as Gershon, who has, and the other one, Sevigny (I think I'm spelling her name right). Not bad, not great, but not bad. Worth a look."
5,Years later,About 6 Years later now and this CD is still mind blowing. Not much else to add. Seek this album.
1,Unsuitable foam.,The foam in this cushion is not dense enough to be used as a seat cushion. It flattens completely. It may work for a child in a high chair.
2,Worst Purchase this year...,"Too Thick, too Firm, uncomfortable, & not even worth giving to my senior dog. Gave it to a neighbor as a Booster Seat, which is all this Cushion is good for, & NOT Worth the Expense."
5,Incredible,"What an amazing CD. Every single time I hear ""Worship,"" my soul is stirred. There's so much Spirit in this CD, so much Truth, so much unabashed and unashamed praise that I doubt it will ever be dislodged from my ""Favorite Albums"" list."
5,Truely Talented,"This CD will give you inspiration and thought, It contains a hint of all aspects of music, from R&B to poetry. You will enjoy the melodies of Reflection, and the mid-tempos of Poor Man and the Color of Hate. Every track is just, perfect. I simply love this CD. Souljahz late it down lyrically, clearly, and Spiritually. Their writing capablities really shine along side the catchy beats of T-boy (Tonex). Souljahz deserve much props for this... I consider them hidden veterans of music... I have been listening to their music for about three years. Trust me, this CD is promising!"
5,You can't go wrong with Souljahz,"WOW! This group is awesome! I've owned their CD for about a week now and I still can't get enough of them. I saw them in concert after a local christian radio station publized their concert. After hearing their songs on the radio, I knew this would be an awesome concert. The vibe they gave off was so much more then I expected. They had everyone on their feet and jumping around and the girl can really bust out some off the wall moves. The thing I liked most about this cd is that I can listen to it with my whole family but it is also a favorite with all my friend. If you don't own this CD, you are really missing out! So go buy it now!"
4,24 Hour Lifesaver,We recently flew to Thailand and my son had so much fun with these toys. He could easily put them into the case they came in and go (when we were making transfers). They came in and out of the case dozens of times and transformed into many things. We had many people in Korea and Japan stop in the airports as he built and enjoy his creations.
4,This was a great book!!!,"Hey, I love the Mode series books, if you haven't read this book yet you might not want to read further-- I'm going to mention things you might not want to know. First off, congrats to Darian and Colene, but also, I give my regards (trying to not spoil here). Although I like these books, I'm kinda wishing Anthony would get them to Darian's world already, but between that they sure do have hectic tavelings! Okay, listen up, anyone who knows when the 4 Mode book is coming out, and possibly what it's about, can you please write to me? Thanks!! --Jessica"
4,Piers Anthony Does It Again!,"For those who have read this book and have nothing better to do than complain about its repetitiveness I say, Get a Life! Piers reminds the reader of Colene's mental state so that we don't lose perspective of her perspective. Mr.Anthony has given, by far, the best representation of a suicidal teenager girl I have ever seen from a person who hasn't experienced it first hand. I should know. I've been close. Although I DO have a problem with the excessive amount of nudity in this book, I don't let that get in the way of the excellence of the story. Elizabeth Pearson- age 16"
3,"Okay, but not the best of the series","Anthony spends too much time in this book setting up scenery and action and although the characters interact, I don't get the sense that they care too much either way. Colene's science teacher introduction was good, but I can't understand why AFTER she was [forced to make love] she got a crush and started flirting with the teacher. And it was INCREDIBLY convenient that the one thing she remembers in biology has to do with Burgess. An ok read, but didn't make me jump out of my seat."
4,have you read this?!?,"I believe most of the reviews I have read in this site are downright uninformed. I think Piers would agree with me. First of all, the main character's name is ""Colene"" and furthermore, she is a vessel of ""dolor"" not dower. Have you people even read this book?!?!?! As in any series there is need for a re-cap of events and character descriptions with each new book. This is a great series, if you read the books and disagree I can respect that, at least you'll have some idea of what you're reviewing"
2,A lightweight book in a lightweight series,"Another lightweight fantasy novel by Mr. Anthony in a lightweight series. This book and series is recommended only for juveniles. It did not hold my interest. The characters' misadventures weren't all that interesting nor compelling. Anthony does bring to closure some of the personal issues that each character has developed in the first two novels. It seems obvious at the ending that there will be another book in the series to settle the events started in the DoOon Mode in Virtual Mode. Since we haven't seen the next installment as yet, one can guess that either the series didn't do all that well and is not a high priority for Anthony to continue or that he frankly has no place to go with the storyline. The next book could actually be the best since a hopping mad Dwang could once again pursue his plans to invade the other modes. It would be up to Colene to thwart his plans once more, provided she survived."
3,Not as good as 1st two,"This is the third book in the ""Virtual Mode"" series and although I loved the first two, I really didn't like this one as much. Others might though."
5,When is the next one coming out? I can't wait!!!,"I love Piers Anthony because he exceeds at putting both Sci-fi and fantasy together in the same book. The mode series is no different. I love it! I heard he may not make another one. ::is sad:: Why? He left this book off so abruptly, he ought to make at least ONE more book and finish it off there if he wishes to end this fabulous series! ^_^"
5,This item has no price on it.,Naturally I think this book is great because I wrote it. But you haven't put any price on it and I doubt anyone will think of buying it without one.
5,How Poetry Works,"I would never, ever leave poetry, as Susan Briscoe suggests. Poetry comes at its own will, in poem-shaped visions. No poem that is forced onto the page is a true poem."
1,"Overpriced art, not a map","This isn't really a map; it's an artistic drawing of the area, concentrating on places in the Hillerman series. If you're a huge fan, you may want to make it into a wall poster; but for a real map of the area, get what Leaphorn himself uses - the AAA map of Indian Country. It's free, far more detailed, and far more accurate. At $... this would be a nice addition; but at this price I felt ripped off. Get the AAA map instead and save the money."
3,I had such high expectations....,"When I ordered this map, I think I was expecting Lt. Leaphorn's legendary crime map. I didn't get it and I think my overly high expectations have kept me from enjoying this map as much as I might have. The map has some problems. I don't care for the oblique view. Some of the border art is not that well done and it's distracting. I wish they hadn't put the compass points diagram in the middle of the map. The map does have pretty much all the real places mentioned in Hillerman's books (I'm going to give up looking for Short Mountain). Now that I have this map I'm going to have to go back and reread all the books and find all the places that weren't in my Rand McNally atlas. There are some serious spoilers (especially for People of Darkness) in the site descriptions on the back. So be careful if you haven't read all the books yet."
4,Wish I could!,"I, too, would love to enjoy this series again. The show, for me like many others, led me to become a pilot and now flight instructor. I was about to put this set on my Christmas list but choked at the price. For $100 a copy would be mine, but not at this price. Note that the EAA also sells the series on DVD, at about the same price. I had bought some 4-show VHS tapes for about $15 each (again from EAA), a far better buy. And since the original quality was rather low, VHS is just fine."
3,NOT AT THIS PRICE,I am sure the quality is good if it has been remastered; however is way too high priced no matter the quality.
3,Won't buy at this price,"I'm a huge fan of Sky King and have been since I was a kid in the fifties. Any product at all on Sky King is great to have, so I've given this set 3 stars without having seen it. However, it looks like I won't see it, for I feel that this price is way way, WAY out of line. It's too much. Maybe $150, how does that sound? That would work for me. It is, after all, a lot of episodes, so I could see paying 150. At 150, I will bet that you generate some sales, which probably isn't happening at the asking price.Thank you!The Kingfishc/o The Mystic Knights Of The Sea Lodge Hall"
3,it was ok,"while mr. smalls is an excellent raconteur, i found his book disappointing. some of the most deliciously described dishes were not in the book! we want the recipes for the coconut ice box cake or that orange cake that toni morrison loved so much! and the recipes that i have tried so far (caramel cake and the hoecakes) left me sorely disappointed. since my mother hails from south carolina, i had high expectations of the recipes.i enjoyed the stories very much - but it seems as if i'll have to use my imagination for the tastes of those wonderfully described dishes."
2,"Read it for the stories, not the food.","My mother is from a little town just outside of Spartanburg so I was very interested in this cookbook. Well,as a collection of stories about Mr. Small's family and friends it's charming but as a cookbook it's weak on substance and none of my South Carolinian relatives (all great cooks) were impressed by the book either.If you want a serious cookbook discussing classic black food try the original Ebony Cookbook or Spoonbread or Strawberry Wine instead."
3,Good playset for superhero fans,Playset is durable; Fun for all superhero fans. My 4-year old grandson loves it.
3,A decent deal if you can compromise,"We bought this television because our 12-channel vintage TV and our 13-inch TV/VCR simply were awful for entertaining. Of course 20 inches doesn't impress any of our guests, but at least they can see the picture.For $88 at Target we simply couldn't pass this up. The picture is fine, though nothing like an LCD. But if you're reading this I doubt you're looking for fabulous quality.So far it's holding up just fine and I love watching the Food Network on it. One problem: there's no AV hookup in the back of the TV. Odd, I think. There is one on the front so it's perfect for video games. We hooked up our Playstation 2 to it to play movies.If you buy this you'll simply have to get used to the wires popping out of the front of the TV. Other than that, it was a great deal."
5,These notes are great,"The Iliad notes help out tremendously, especially during class discussions and when trying to read the book it makes much more sense."
5,aaaahhhhhh,"really needed this book for my class. it helped me understand the bigger themes and pictures i wasn't understanding when i read the Iliad. The Iliad is one of the most boring, confusing books i have ever read and this helped it become alot more clear to me. Thanks cliffnotes!"
3,On the thin side,"I was disappointed in this guide. I wanted to use it as a supplement as I feared I would not totally understand the Iliad. When I started reading the Iliad, I realized that one doesn't need this Cliff Notes. The Iliad is very readable. I did not think this guide made much substantive contributions - it just says what you could already figure out from reading the book. Not much insight here. Pass on it."
3,"Slick, but brutal and enjoyable.","This album in no way qualifies as ""true black metal"", but Dimmu Borgir have still managed to craft a bone-jarringly brutal metal album that easily flattens all the nu metal trash currently serenading disaffected kiddies from coast to coast. Said youngsters would be well-advised to pick up this deliciously festering aural equivalent of a Hammer horror flick. Unlike Cradle of Filth, it doesn't stray to far into Mansongoth territory, keeping one foot firmly planted in the howling windswept blastbeat forest, while layering on just enough carnivalesque keyboard/orchestral embellishments to stretch the scenes out across the multiplex screen. Hey, it ain't Darkthrone and the orchestrations ain't Ligeti or Wagner, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do; namely, beating your head in while keeping your mouth intact to munch on popcorn."
5,A crushing and amazing album,"Ok first things first. Don't listen to people that say this album is Dimmu borgir's worst release or nonsense like that. Puritanical is different but amazing, heavy allround. Combing traditional heavy metal with brutal elements of traditional black metal, the fast and awesome riffing, the haunting vocals from shagrath, the bass and not to mention Nick barker's ferocious and hell-quick drumming. He is like the best drummer i have ever heard. Check this one out, especially if you haven't heard them, then get enthrone darkness triumphant, that is a classic."
4,"Well, it's okay, but not as good as it could have been...","Now that I've listened to this album several times, I've realized it has some flaws. Mainly starting around the second half of the CD, after IndoctriNation. From there, the songs all start in the same key, and just in general aren't as good as the first seven songs. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the CD is not bad, especially the album closers Sympozium and Perfection Or Vanity. But it just doesn't seem to have the power and hasrhness of the first half.Enthrone Darkness Triumphant has since become my favorite Dimmu album."
1,A follow up for dummies,"-Gee, I know how speak proper english, but does the reviewer below know how to capitalize the first letter of each sentence?Anyway, this is music for losers who have a ADD comprehension problem. Yeah, in a sense, I do agree with the previous reviewer. Pimple-faced fat kids with too much goth pancake makeup on their faces. Most of 'em probably don't know the lyrics to this thing unless they have a cue sheet handy.Ok, so the guy took piano lessions. Big deal. The drummer can keep a beat. 'Wow'. And yeah, they know how to play riffs on a guitar. 'Good' for them.All it is, is a bunch of growls and snarls after a tracheotomy. I'll bet Darth Vader could 'sing' better than this._"
3,2004 not 2001,OH FRYING PANS WHY DO I LIKE THESE BANDS THEY PULL THE SAME trick every time.I read Audio Cd 2001and i get the 2004:O
4,the best i've heard...,"This album is without a doubt, a black metal masterpiece. If anyone has the odacity to call this a ""sellout"" album, then they must be some loser who still lives in their parents basement and has nothing better to do that judge other peoples work. What doesn't this album have that a black metal fan would want?Blazing solos, tortured vocals, machine gun drums, and a real orchestra? Come on.....it's all here. There can be no gripes about this album amongst metal fans. A definite buy."
5,Why keep on comparing these guys to CoF?,"I Love Dimmu Borgir.... and I love Cradle Of Filth! Both are excellent bands in their own particular style. Who are the ones that benefit from all this? WE ALL!!!I don't know why people keep comparing DM to CoF... both are very different in style, vocals, song structures, tempos, lyrics, etc...Yeah, maybe both of them are not playing true black metal but who gives a F*CK! they play good heavy metal. If you are reading this review its because you like metal.. so do I. So why complaining about what kind of music they are playing if they are heavy as hell?About this CD... well, this was my introduction to Dimmu Borgir... Ohh my God! This is one of the best CDs I have ever heard.If you like it heavy, raw, melodic, violent and satanic.. well, this is the one for you!A Masterpiece! 10 out of 10."
3,beginners black metal,"if you like cradle of filth (who arnt actually black metal at all) and are thinking of trying something just a tad heavier, then try this. Not as atmospheric as their earlier releases, but has an orchestra and lots of gay fx/noises. pretty melodic, and if you were wandering, it does have puritania on it( better known as the song off cky). any way sounds like cradle of filth minus the annoyance of stupid high puff singing, add a little violin, actual talent and general norwegianess. good if your newq to the genre, average otherwise. best tracks are prob blessings upon the throne of tyranny, and kings of the carnival creation just in case u want to download them ;)"
1,what a joke!,"This album [stunk]. The drumming is good, thanks to nicholas, but the guitar work is pretty ordinary, and the lyrics are cheap and shallow.'Enthrone Darkness Triumphant' puts this album to shame melody wise, and 'For All Tid' still reigns as their best haunting, atmospheric album to date.Sad to see what Dimmu became.This album will appeal to those who just want to scare their parents/priests/local authorities. Others know there used to be alot more behind them than this, and will avoid buying anything from them in the future."
1,"""I don't like Cradle of Filth but i like Dimmu Borgir""","I m pretty tired of hearing this. I remember when I first heard of Dimmu Borgir. It was suposed to be an original black metal band. I listened to some of their songs on the album FOR AL TID and i though that it was good.But this band is becoming more and more on each album a Cradle of Filth clone. C'mon this cd is just a bad copy of Midian. Nothing original in here... If you wanna buy a good cd from this band, try FOR ALL TID."
3,Mediocre at best,"This album is just a random mixture of thrashing guitars, classical keyboard notes, The cookie monster verse vocals, and a melodic vocal chorus by some female dubbed voice. I don't understand the overall appeal. The music is entertaining at times but, there arent any parts that sound unique or interesting. It's pretty much a segment of things you would have heard on other metal albums mixed together to create an epic effect on each song. I can listen to it and get some enjoyment but, it doesnt do anything to inspire or enlighten my musical appetite."
1,Black Metal for christians,"Get a pretty stale Bathory cover band that plays everything 2 times too slow, get some guy who loves makeup and jewelry to imitate George Fisher's voice real bad, then get some guy to play really DISCO sounding funky techno diddles that sound they were inspired by the Munsters and Adams Family theme songs. Then call it black metal. This is about as metal as Cradle of Filth. I don't mind that you goths have your own scene but keep it out of our metal!If you're interested in something new, try Anata's very underrated Dreams of Death and Dismay, has far more soul than this assembly line by the numbers Cradle of Filth disco."
2,...,"there are those who call this poser. then there are those who defend it. then there is the truth. this album speaks for itself. just listen to it, it is really nothing special. its all been done before.""you gotta know where you came from, in order to know where you are going.""MJK"
1,Good charlotte gone blackmetal...,"...Oh no its dimmu borgir but i alway think of them was good charlotte wannabe blackmetal. Dimmu borgir's ""puritanical euphoric misanthropia"" is not only a cheesy title but the whole sound of this album along with the rest of dm's albums are basically crap and poser blackmetal, at its worse.All the songs here are ripped off sounds of cof and emperor all together and the lirycs are extra cheesy...Dummy burger is actullie a more fitting name for them. If you love true blackmetal do not support these posers. Not recommended!!"
5,Disturbing ! ! !,"I have to give Dimmu Borgir some credit, I really didn't expect ""Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia"" to be a horid mediocre attempt at a new album. Containing some black metal godheads from the likes of Cradle of Filth (the (according to record sales) biggest black metal band on the planet, right next to Dimmu Borgir) and greats like Vortex (all heil the vocal master!!!). This is a solid album and one of the best of the year.""Yeah, it has some appeal, but how's the music?"" you may be asking yourself at this very moment. Perfect. Flawless. Operatic. Hard as Hell. Songs like ""Puritania"" (probally the best on the album) and ""Kings Of The Carnival Creation"" are up there in the cream of the metal crop. The riffs, keyboards, drums, vocals, everything comes in a package (a disturbing package at that) wrapped up in perfection. All in all, one of the best metal albums of the year, and a classic in its own right. Basically it is one hell of a keeper.-MC"
3,Am Ithe only one not impressed by this album?,Don't let the orchestra parts fool you into thinking this album is melodic. The string parts are utterly uninspired. the vocals from vortex pale to Spriritual or Borknagar. The drums are great on the blasts but mediocre when the tempo slows. The sweeping melodic solos on Spiritual blow away anything on this one. I can hum several of the leads on Spiritual but not a one from Puritanical. It is a good album but I expected so much more.
5,My daughter really likes this.,My daughter seems to really like this. She holds him and gums on his face :) I like that it is colorful and not too big. My daughter is 4 months old and this is a good size for her to hold on her own. The monkey is very soft and cute.
5,Sweet little lady bug blanket,I bought this lady bug security blanket for my grand daughter who will be born the end of August. It is really sweet and soft. I know she'll love it.
5,Very cute,This product is very cute. I ordered it for a friends baby shower gift. Also got the matching wubbanub. The part that touches the baby is more like a receiving blanket where as the part with the caterpillar is softer.Perfect size for baby. I covered my two month to see and it covers her well. Will probably work great as a blanket till at least six months or maybe longer.
4,cool security blanket,"I bought the precious puppy for my 2 month old son. It seems to be well made, my only disappointment is the backing of the blankie. According to the picture it looks like the lining is made of satin/silk, however when I received it, the lining is made from a siff stripe cotton fabric, which makes it a bit too hard for my little one. My older son has the kiddopotamus ones which he's had for the past 3 years, and he loves it to death. I had to buy an identical one for him, since he took it everywhere and it needed to be washed quite regularly, so I had to have a replacement for him while one was having a ""bath"". The kiddopotamus one is not lined with any other fabric, it's just the soft velvety fabric all over, except for the ends which is made of the satin, and it really is cuddly. he would rub the blankie on his face till he fell asleep."
5,"Tending lives, nurses on the medical front","This is one of the best books on nursing that I have ever read. Funny, interesting, touching. A unique variety or stories from nurses all over the country. I purchased the book as a gift for a friend who is in nursing school to give her an idea of some of the realitys of the job."
5,Couldn't put it down!!!!,"I'm not a medical person, but I found this book to be a most incredible look at the world of medicine. The stories are told by nurses who are right there, on the front line....better than any ER episode I''ve ever seen. I laughed, I cried, I shuddered my way through this absolutely wonderful book. It was a roller coaster ride of emotions and amazement. Although the stories are from different nurses all over the country, the reader can still""hear"" Heron's voice in the writing...that trademark of dry humor and the ability to cut to the heart of the spirit and the soul. All I can say is WHEN IS THE SEQUEL????? Loved it!!!"
5,harry potter party time,"This was perfect for our harry potter party. I used it to make cookies and cream, turtle, pb filled, and coconut chocolate frogs. After filling them i put them in the freezer for 10minutes or so and they came out perfect. Didnt crack or lose form at all."
3,helpful in shaping chocolate frogs,very useful for those who want to feel how is it to eat an one harry potter inspired chocolate frog. it does worth especially if you want to treat your friends or to surprise kids.
2,It's plastic!!!,"Don't be fooled by the creative photography here. This item is made of plastic. Now to be fair I didn't know anything about chocolate molding and have since discovered that plastic molds are normal, but it's definitely not what i expected. I felt disappointed when I opened the package. Seems overpriced and they charged me more on the shipping than the cost of postage.On the plus side, so far i have not actually used it for chocolate molding but have made reasonably successful jello frogs. will try chocolate next"
5,Great Frog Mold,I purchased this mold to use for chocolate frogs for a Harry Potter party. I wanted them to look like real frogs and they sure did. The only thing I didn't love about this was that they were slightly too large for chocolates. The frogs would make great soaps and they looked fantastic but just a little clunky for plain chocolate. Please note that my opinion about the chocolates being too large didn't stop them from disappearing very quickly. =)
4,"Love this, however picture is a little misleading.",Works wonderful form my Harry Potter chocolate frogs that I made for Halloween. Only complaint is that the image is a little deceiving and it looks like the mold is metal when it is actually plastic.
4,Frog hold arrived in time and is a good price.,This frog hold arrived in great time and is just what I wanted. And a good price. Very satisfied with this product..
5,these are fun.,I figured it would be cute for halloween to have frog-shaped chocolates. They're good if you put shredded coconut in them along with the chocolate!
4,Nice and durable!,This is NOT a metal product but a very detailed sturdy plastic mold. I can tell this will last. It's also clear when it came. I can't wait to make ice and chocolate plus soaps and more!
1,No more time / needs to come quicker,To be honest they weren't there when I needed to and I think it needs to be here quicker sorry.
4,"Flimsy, but it works!","This mold is made of plastic and is a bit flimsy, but it works well and the candies are great! Good detail. And for the price, definitely worth it!"
5,Great for a Harry Potter party,This was used to make chocolate frogs for a Harry Potter birthday party. They were a big hit. They also worked great for providing treats for the school's fall festival bake sale.
4,"It says they're plastic, by the way.","I really like these molds. I've used them on several occasions now, having originally bought them for a Harry Potter Premiere party. The molds are not very bendable so I had some issues getting the chocolate out, but that might just be because I'm incompetant with using molds or something. They're pretty sturdy plastic. I think they say on the molds they're FDA approved or something, so that's good to know."
4,Frog candy mold,"This mold worked great the one and only time I was able to use it! Just hand-wash it, and it'll last much longer for you...The heat from the dishwasher warped mine!"
3,Frogs anyone,"Would not recomend buying from buy2get1freenovelty, doesn't take that much care of his product when he ships. He has you pay for first class mail and sends it in the cheapest way he can get it to you.The product is clear hard plastic and a great have for potter fans.The rating is mainly do to how it was shipped and that it took some time after I paid for it to get it shipped."
2,Crack in mold :(,"I had lots of fun making the frogs but i couldn't make one because it came cracked and then the cracked spread a bit, and it came like that, the shipping wasn't that great. It would be nice if they would send me a new one."
3,Comes Bent in Half,This tray would have been great if it hadn't come bent in half both times I ordered it.... The mold itself is cute though and I definitely will use it a lot.
4,stepped on a frog,"Price was excellent. It was delivered as permanently bent in half, which hopefully was done during shipping. I simply cut the mold down the fold line and it is even easier to use than those I use uncut."
2,ehhh,it was okay but its a cheap plastic i tried to make jello with it but that didn't work at all it was mush it will probably work for chocolate though

4,From the Darkness Came Light,"This first book in a Trilogy Underway*..Is well worth a read. It traces a man's life through dark times when hopelessness was his mantra, meeting his first spiritual teacher and the opening of his mind and heart toward the light.A rough journey that many can relate and resonate to. The author is an amazingly creative writer, musician and world traveler, who pours out a shadow side in this journey that spans decades. It takes place in the UK..a solid book drawn from experience and woven into a fictionalized format. Reminded me of Lucifer's Hammer and that of course tags off of Dante.A book ultimatly of hope and magic."
4,lipgloss,"The seller sent item as described and promptly I would purchse from this seller again, Thank you and I appreicate the promptness."
5,good price and solid,"We bought two of these harnesses last season, spent ten months sailing, and they were great. Much less expensive than at the Marine Store. If you are over six feet tall the harness may fall closer to your upper chest than mid chest area, for me it was fine but for my boyfriend a bit high on his chest. Although, we tried on many harnesses and they all fit him the same anyway, so save your money and buy online. As for us, we are glad for the use and that we have never had to test them!!!"
4,Well constructed,"Heavy duty webbing, professional grade harness. Liked the fact that it had sewn in light reflective material on the shoulders. Not a perfect fit for me though so I had to return. While the chest diameter is adjustable, the shoulder straps are not and it fell too high on my torso for my comfort. If you can get the right fit, you can depend on this harness to perform well."
5,stainless steel thinning scissors,"This product is absolutely great, works perfectly, it is very convenient to hold it, not too heavy, doesn't hurt my fingers, doesn't loose its sharpness. I am very happy about it and yes, shipping and handling was as described by the seller. Thank you"
2,Were they feeling a little down when they wrote this??,"I was interested to note that a lot other of reviewers had a problem with the sex in this book. Geez, it would have been really dull without it. Originaly, Rama was the awesome subject (RWR), then it became the setting for a soap opera. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the odd human drama, I actually watch and enjoy Melrose Place, but at least it doesn't get all PREACHY like this book does! And another thing, Clarke and Lee were obviously feeling a little down on humanity when they wrote this. Two stars instead of one because the original was soooooo good."
5,Individuals,"This is a brilliantly written book. All of the main carachters have personalities, they are not just storybook names. They are individuals. Each has their own personal problems, pet peeves and ways of expressing things. If you have read the other[first two], this tops them all. The mystery of not knowing the ultimate destination of the colonist's craft and the fact the the ""New Eden"" is falling into it's own moral hole, makes me anxious to find out what happens in""RAMA REVEALED"
5,A VERY GOOD BOOK!!!,"I do not usually write a review, and this is not a review. The story is quite different from what you might expect, so few people liked it.I enjoyed the previous Rama novels. If you did you may enjoy this book.The last part of the book is a great example of the Human Animal. When we speak of the most dangerous beast, or the most poisonous, look into a mirror!Your main characters evolve continuously into, mostly, a paradym of the best HUMANAS in our history because of there fabulous trip. Also, since they were a slice of the inteligent elite to go to Rama in the first. Ignorant and suspicious individuals who want power are not proper canadates for a space mission.Many intelectul debates on a multitude of topics arise from this story."
5,"The Garden of Rama was a darn good book, deserving of a 10!","I hate to say this, but a lot of you people have bad taste. I read this book last weekend and I must say that it was probably one of the better two in the series. I thought it was suspensful, provoking, and just a good book. I also think that drawing parelells to life today (the Aids like disease, the dictatorship, and the war) simply shows that human nature is about the same, time isn't neccesarilly going to improve it."
4,A Sequel that is better than the original,"After reading the first Rama I wouldn't have bought the sequel:I go this used. The reason for the large space ship and the aliens involvedis at least in part explained here as a cataloging of space going species.In some ways the novel reminds me of ""The City and the Stars"" in a strange way. The aging of the characters and the development of the plot makes this a better science fiction novel about travel between stars than theother was a first contact novel."
1,Rama II and Rama III are awful.,"Rama II and Rama III are awful. I'm embarrassed to see Mr. Clarke's name associated with these so-called sequels. They reflect nothing of the science fiction wonder and imagination seen in Rendezvous with Rama and most of his other stories. Rama II & III are completely polluted with political, sociological & religious nonsense and modern emotionalism. Not worth reading. Certainly not worth adding to a fine collection of Clarke books."
1,Bait-and-Switch,"Arthur C. Clarke essentially leased out his good name to Gentry Lee for the Rama books that followed ""Rendevouz with Rama."" Instead of Clarke's spare, elegant prose, Lee's Rama novels are bad pulp fiction in a need of a good edit and a good idea. ""Garden of Rama"" is the worst of the trio. There are multitudinous descriptions of weird creatures and physical spaces and a complicated plot but no real content. The dialogue between characters is sophomoric. I thought I bought a novel by the author of ""Childhood's End"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" but it turned out to be bait-and-switch. Clarke's involvement with this book was undoubtedly relegated to cashing the publisher's checks."
2,"High hopes, little substance","I have to say that I found the whole Rama series to be a bit disappointing. I expected a series with the quality of Clarke's ""Odyssey"" Novels, but they just didn't live up to expectation. There was too many sub-plots and mysteries left un-resolved, events that were over emphasized but never clarified. And to be honest, I found many aspects of the book to be totally unrealistic. Overall this series was quiet a let down. If your going to buy this book, buy if used!"
2,Gardens of Rama is disappointing,"I read the first two books and liked them especially the first. This book is a waste of the series. Genuine mystery gets replaced by mundane explanations and deliberate omissions. All the characters seem to get stupider and one dimensional. Rama gets stupider and its motivations go from unfathomable to arbitrary and shallow. There are sloppy inconsistencies with the first two books. Overall, this book is not worth the read even if or especially if you liked the first two books. The Rama in this book does not exist in the same universe as the first two. On top of all this there is some vaguely nauseating sexual themes involving incest, polyandry, the extremely old and the extremely young."
2,"If you hate science-fiction, then this is the book for you.","After the first part i.e. Rendevous with Rama I could'nt wait to get my hands on the other parts... and when I did get my hands on them, I wish I had never heard the word 'Rama'. The gardenof Rama was especially bad... full of the worst crap I ever read. I'm pretty sure Aruthur did'nt write most of it if not any of it and it's this'Gentry' guy who did most of the work..and turnedthe original idea ( which was great ) into one long unbelievable soap-opera.MEDFAZAHM,Bahrain,26-6-1997."
4,"I liked it, but it is ridiculous at times","I want to give it a 7 but I must be fair. It is a decentbook. I love Clarke and I really love the Rama concept,but I think he is slipping a little bit in his later years.He trys to be too fair to all religions. His view of thefuture is a little bit too politically correct for me. The main character, Nicole Des Jardins, is one of the most unbelievable characters I have ever read in a book. Clarke tries way too hard to make her into this superhuman woman that can handle all things at once and wrap everyones life into a comfortable blanket. Nevertheless if you are willing to skip a few of the more boring parts of it, it is worthwhile. There are some great descriptions of the Raman Spacestation called the Node and the life in the vessel is handled very well I think. Over all it is a good book if you are a Clarke fan and a Raman fan."
1,Horrendous Book,"I read the whole Rama series because I liked Rendezvous With Rama and am a Arthur C. Clarke fan. However, all books following the first book are written by Gentry Lee, not Arthur C Clarke. The text supposedly was checked by Sir Clarke. I know this from an online interview transcript I read.The book focuses excessively on the emotions of the heroine Nicole. Her characterization seems to have little relation to any serious cosmological or theological issues or Science Fiction science. It becomes a drama, not a sci fi book.I say, skip this book. Its a waste of time."
2,Continuing the downward spiral,"Ever so gently this series is starting to drift. GET BACK ON FOCUS!!! Much of the writing was about mundane people doing mundane things, petty conflicts, a lot of wondering and wandering and not much continuity. Once again, as he has done in the past over and over, Clarke comes up with a superlative idea but his literary talents - or lack thereof - are not up to the task. Only rarely does he succeed with character development and this is not an uncommon occurrence among scifi writers.I found myself staring into space several times and even peeking ahead. The best parts were all the creatures in the Garden. It is an axiom that the really memorable science fiction stories do not center on the unworldly aspect but on unforgettable people - Contact, Stranger in a Strange Land, Dune. This series could have been really remarkable but it has been dithered away. What a waste of time and energy."
2,What a disappointment!!!,"What a let-down!!!This is an unbelivably poor, hashed-together, novel with a few points of interest (hence 2 stars, instead of 1) but mostly pathetic and unbelivable. The first section of the book, containing extracts of ""journal entries"" from Nicole's journal (it's obvious now that Nicole is going to be the main character from here on out) which serve to send forward the plot about 13 years (and entangle the characters in some cloyingly obvious sexual ""misunderstandings""). The remainder of the book is a description of the ""colony"" from Earth chosen to inhabit Rama, and the disastrous choices made by nearly everyone -- from the politicians on Earth, to most of the colonists.To paraphrase B.B. King, ""The Thrill of Rama is Gone"". I'll give ""Rama Revealed"" a chance, just because so many loose ends are left hanging.A real disappointment."
2,Suds in Space,"In this, the 2nd sequel to the fine SF novel, ""Rendevous with Rama,"" our herione, Nicole (from ""Rama II"") flys around the Milky Way having babies, then she leaves her oldest (14 yo) daughter to marry an old geezer at some triangle-shaped parking lot near another star because it would reduce inbreeding, then this eagle-headed biot dude wants to send the rest of them back to our Solar System so Nicole goes to sleep for 19 years (I about fell asleep, too) in order to find another 2000 losers from Earth to join this pathetic venture. (Remember, things are pretty sorry on Earth by then, after the great Chaos/depression, so it won't take much.) Oh yeah, her younger daughter learns how to masturbate while they enter orbit around Mars. If it sounds stupid, it is. I fought to preserve my memory of the beauty of the original story. But hey, its your time to waste."
3,This was the third book?,"OOOPS, I read the third book first. It caught my interest though, enough to get me to buy the 4th book anyway. I find his work to be imaginative and his writing style to be intense, yet the over description of certain scenery and surroundings detract from the story. All things considered this is a fair work to read on an airplane some time. Oh, and who else wants to know why he chose to call those things ""Melons""?"
1,Absolutely Dreadful,"Tedious, boring, endless. This book goes over and over the same agonizing territory, and it can do that easily because it is impossibly long.Nicole, the heroine, is an impossible jerk. She gets an acute attack of hot pants while on board a 12(?) year space ship voyage. As far as I can figure out, that is ALL the book is about. It is torture. If you hate somebody give them this book."
1,Horrible. Just horrible.,"Wow. I'll not repeat what so many have said here, but simply agree. Horrible.I wish this book were alive so I could cause it pain. Yes, that horrible."
1,Not just bad but astonishingly bad.,"It's hard to overstate just how bad this book is. Thin plot? Check. Dimensionless, predictable and stereotypical characters? Check. Outlandish and hard to believe behavior? Check. What makes this even worse than your typical bad book is that Arthur C. Clarke's name is on the cover. Obviously Gentry Lee did most of the writing and story development (or lack thereof). One has to hope he's a better engineer than writer."
1,This is bull!,It's not more Hard SF! It's only a big soap opera in space...I gave a 2 because I'm a Clarke fan and haven't got the nerves to give him a 1. I have lost them after the read.
1,"Bad science, worse writing","Just a couple of examples of how utterly worthless the science is in the Rama sequels:The octospiders, we learn, are an underwater race. Fine. But Gentry Lee has them communicating by bands of colored light around their heads, because--get this--sound doesn't travel well under water, but light does. Uh huh. That's what he said. Apparently, he never heard of whales and dolphins.So, the octospiders have no words for anything. Yet, later, Lee makes up octospider words for their system of measuring time (the smallest unit being about 20 seconds, as I recall). Yep. They have no speech, but they have names for things.That's just for starters. As I forced myself to finish reading this dreck, I began to wonder if it was a hoax, a challenge to the readers to find as many inconsistencies as possible. It just made me feel angry and insulted."
3,Middle of the Road,"An okay read. So far neither of the Rama sequels have come close to the first book, ""Rendevous with Rama"". It is in interesting series at least and I am anxious to see where it is all heading in ""Rama Revealed""."
2,"This novel is two books, only Half is the real A. C. Clarke","What a major dissappointment ! The first half of the book is true A. C. Clarke in excellent form, atmospheric, gripping & with the imagination firing like the master he is. And then what happens? We get a an honest to goodness, old fashioned soap! I could live with a cliffhanger ending if I cared what happens next."
3,A real dissapointment compared to the first two.,"The first book was fantastic, I really loved it. In the second book there was too much ""character"" stuff and too little ""tech"" stuff. Clarke cannot write good characters anyway, not Lee either. This book is crap compared to the first one. No tech stuff at all, only a lot of really boring moral stuff about the decline of human society and stuff. The only interesting part is when Richard is admitted to the avian/myrmicat/sessile lair."
2,what's the definition of insanity?,"Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.And for all intents, since i am going to go for the sequel- I must be insane.Or not, since I don't really expect it to be better- just some closure.Garden was better than the the soap opera that was Rama 2 (hence 2 stars), but still a total let down from Rendezvous.It really bugs me that the people chosen to populate Rama by the government included convicts. I would really think in reality people would be willing to cut off their right arms to be part of something like this and would chosen from the best and the brightest. (And if the analogy is the New World- well, a look at the punishments of colonial times would tell you that the death penalty was a popular punishment for any number of crimes including theft. The colonists took it into accounct that their members incuded criminals.)"
2,Another trip to the Well,"In this second sequel to Rendezvous with Rama Gentry Lee takes us to a hint of the origins of the Rama spacecraft. Unfortunately, the answers are not very satisfying. The ""Rama Node"" is said to be huge, but the characters never get a sense of it. And the existence of dozens of other Rama type vessels and an even larger space station diminishes the awe of the original Rama craft.I read this, but I wouldn't ever again."
2,sucked,"The first book--just by Arthur C. Clarke--was awesome. The second--with Lee--was decent. I just hope that Clarke didn't actually write this because otherwise he needs to give up writing.The only thing that kept me from being depressed that I had wasted my time with this book was the description of the ant creatures--that was decently creative.I didn't think the ""sex manuals"" another reviewer wrote about were annoying but they definitely were not interesting. The politics were like a lecture on how people today should act with no flavor to them whatsoever."
2,We have come to expect better from Clark.,"If I want a season ending cliff hangger, I'll watch prime time soaps. This book starts in one direction(good)in a RAMA tradition. It then turns into a morality play unworthy of the author, and then stops, as if it were a weekly serial. I love a good series, but each book should stand on its' own. This one just wants you to buy the next installment."
2,Suck-o-RAMA,"Ok.... I admit that I have enjoyed reading the RAMA books, but not in the same way I enjoy reading other books written by Arthur C. Clarke, a man I consider to be one of the greatest writers ever. These books, except for the first one, are just action adventures/soap operas. There is nothing deep or anything that will make you think in these books. Reading this series is like watching Pro-Wrestling: you know it is ridiculous, but it keeps you entertained, so you keep watching/reading. For anyone who is not really into Sci-Fi, and is not looking for original ideas, but is looking for a bunch of pointless sex, this is a great book. I am really bothered that Clarke sunk to the level of writing a series with pathetic cliffhangers at the end to sucker a reader into buying another book in the series. He should leave that up to Diane Carey and Peter David who think that writing Star Trek novels is the same thing as writing Sci-Fi."
5,"Good books, but not for those who want the same ol thing.","After reading the reviews on this book, I have to admit to being a little disappointed in the reviewers. Especially the reviewer from Mexico, whos gripes appear to be moralistic rather than based on the story at hand. Rendezvous with Rama was a great book, but it seems to me that everyone was expecting the following books to be exactly the same. I am glad to announce that the books are not like it. They are distinct and quite a pleasure to read once you stop expecting it to be just like the original."
2,Stick to the first two.,"After being entranced by the first two entries in this series, I was severely disappointed by the third. Except for the very beginning of the book, the traditional sci-fi aspects fly right out the window. Instead, you're left with a socio-economic lesson and subtle-as-a-jackhammer comparisons to our current society. This was a snore and a disappointment."
2,Poor Quality,I purchased this whole ensemble for my son's room and was very disappointed in the quality. Your definitely paying for the name on this. The quality is extremely cheap for the price.
4,A nice reversal of positions for hero and heroine!,"Even with so many books in print, Mary Balogh still comes up with a new twist to the delicious formula we all know and love. In this case, we have beautiful Lady Rachel Palmer, sought after by all the men. She has never known love until she meets the one man who resists her charms. The man is Reverand David Gower. Here is the reversal; often it is the woman who is a governess or some other gently born lady of little means, who is pursued by the wealthy high born lord. This is a classic story of love at first sight (even if he doesn't know it yet). The characters of Rachel Palmer and David Gower are two imperfect people who help each other to grow and change. If you like your romance with a heroine who knows what--or rather who--she wants and pursues him, then this book is for you. A fun read!"
2,Too bland for me,"I really feel Balogh missed an opportunity to come up with a classic angst-ridden love story, which she writes so well. Instead, I felt this story was bland with wishy-washy characters that did nothing to capture my sympathy. I just felt that everyone was 'playing' at being 'good' - in the end, I didn't care what anyone did. Give it a miss would be my advice."
2,a gift of daisies,"Pleasant, but not as involving as Balogh's others. Lady Rachel Palmer is the toast of London society, until she is introduced to the Reverend David Gower. He's the new minister of her country parish, and a friend of her childhood sweetheart. She immediately falls in love with him, and decides that her life in London is artificial and unfulfilling. She has her work cut out for her, however, to convince David that she would rather be a minister's wife, than married to some powerful, wealthy aristocrat. The story is as much about her spiritual awakening as it is a romance. The romance, frankly, is rather tepid, and not all that interesting. People who enjoy Christian romances will probably like this one."
1,This was a low quality video where the picture was eratic,"The content of the video was satisfactory, however the quality of the video was poor. The picture displayed jumped about which seemed to indicate a horizontal problem with the TV"
2,psychedelic sea monster?,"Well, my favorite animal is the scallopped hammerhead shark, so i was excited to see a beanie baby in this configuration. Imagine my dissappointment when I opened it and saw that the bottom of the shark is a weird tie-dye acid trip of colors."
1,stinky,"I bought this product new and when I got it stunk like someones dusty trashy house. It also was ratty looking like a used stuffed animal gets when it has been played with. It had the tags but so does some of my daughters stuffed animals, but it doesn't mean they are new. This one isn't that cute either."
3,Excerpts...,"Although not stated in the video descritption, this VHS is actually excerpts from the original Bobby Jones How to Break 90 ""movies"". This video excerpts the instructional portion of these movies. This is valuable, since Bobby Jones is able to discuss the essence of the golf swing and convey these thoughts in a concise manner. While a bit of Bobby's swing was dictated by the equipment of the time, the basics still apply today. It is unfortunate hat the entire mvies weren't included, as they were very humourous and contained the major actors of the time."
2,May not be what you expect!,"If you're like me and have seen these mini-movies featured on the Golf Channel, you may be disappointed by the fact that the story lines have been cut out of these tapes. The charm and humor evident in the original films is all but gone, save the low key and warm delivery of Jones. It's too bad the producers of the video versions chose to drop the very thing that made these films worth seeing. While some of the instruction is sound (even for today's modern game) without the actors and storylines intact, these videos offer nothing that isn't in any other run-of-the-mill golf instruction video on the market."
2,impossible to get through,"I'm a Rutgers student, and I had to read this book for an anthropology class which was taught by Ramos Zayas. While she is an engaging lecturer, and I thoroughly enjoyed the other readings for the class, veiled sentiments in particular, this particular book was extremely difficult to get through. She is a very smart woman, but this book is more written for a graduate level anthropology class rather than an intro course. The vocabulary and sentence structure she uses is very tricky and you pretty much have to have a general idea of anthropology to really understand it.I am an anthro major but I read this book for my first anthropology course and was like....huh???? in every other paragraph. What's even more shocking is that my TA for the course told us that she had to read this same book for one of her graduate courses and had trouble with it!I'm an avid reader of ethnographies but this one was just too tough."
1,The worst book ever,A disgrace to Puerto Ricans she hits us with vocabulary that she thinks will make her smart but it is a jumbled mess. Try again
2,Can I get a record deal too?,"This type of album isn't for people like me. I like underground music. Angie seems like a cool woman, and she is real cute. And actually has a decent rhyming voice, but she needs new writers and producers. ""If I Could Go"" I will admit, I always found myself (not wanting to though) huming the beat and chorus. But that's because it's one of those purpously catchy sappy songs. And in there lies the problem with this album, and releases like it. It's made and marketed as if it's going to be the artists only chance to have a hit. In 15 years you won't hear this durring rotation on ""old school"" radio shows. They knew they could make a quick hit and did it. Formula-matic music is made to be disposable and thrown away and forgotten after about a year. Which [not coincidently] is, probably about when Angie's next installment will be arriving. There is definitely a pattern here."
5,"Angie mar Super star... ""The Voice of New York",Love Angie since the days of being an intern on Hot to now. My only wish is that she never gave up and kept making music.
3,Angie Martinez is better off being a DJ,"Angie Martinez is ok as a rapper but, I think that she is better off being a DJ instead. I don't think her rapping skills are that good."
2,Uh...Sequels Suck; 2 stars for only 2 good songs,"You know, I ran my ... to the store to get this CD and really wished I had not. Compared to her first CD (Up Close and Personal) this mess is not even CLOSE to being what it could be. The first 3 tracks are, what I am guessing, Angie attempting to make us feel her pain about how 'GOOD' (relative term) she is. The words are stupid *we're animals, we hold our head high* --uhhh...WHAT?!!; The music must have been in another room while Angie was writing her lyrics. Throw in some dorks making diff. accents and you find yourself wondering WHAT IN THE WORLD you bought. Luckily there is the song that everyone digs -THank you Lil Mo and whenever you throw Missy's name you know you have good beats. I really don't start listening to the CD until AFTER track 3. Maybe it's me but a few of the songs sound like follow up songs to the first CD - without the catchy tunes and awesome beat. Sooo...my review...borrow your friend's version. Or better yet - wanna buy mine?"
2,could've been better,This cd was allright but some of the songs were really old school and pretty boring if I have to say so.I mean this lady is supposd to be a rapper and half of the songs can't even get a party started.
4,"simple, concise, & jam packed","I small book packed with brief, but valuable information on single herbs, and simple holistic suggestions for treating a wide variety of common ailments with herbal remedies, aromatherapy, diet, and lifestyle."
5,The True story of Andersonville,The last depot depicts the pathetic and political aspects of this prison that I consider more of a battle than Antietam. The suffering was unbelievable. Marvel uses Eugene Forbes as one of as his obscure sources. He uses many more but he makes it clear that Wirz the head of the prison was not the problem but the dissolving Confederacy that was built on shifting sand. Without bias this book shows the horror of being a POW.
5,"First-rate, superb scholarship and fine writing.","If you can read only one history of Andersonville, this should be the one. It is thoroughly researched, dispels a lot of the old myths, and is eminently readable."
4,Balanced Look At Terrible Chapter In Our History,"Mr. Marvel's book does not defend Andersonville, but neither does it villify it's operators. The story of the infamous camp is balanced and the book is well-written. An important book if one's knowledge of Andersonville is limited to the TNT film."
5,Loving my Heartflex!,It is alot of fun to walk while using the heartflex. It really works your arms. Changes things up a bit. Love it
4,Interesting Autobiography,"Don't read this book to learn how to fish the Texas Gulf Coast. While there are morsels of fishing knowledge to be learned from the book, it is more an autobiography of a man who has devoted his life to something he loves. You will be treated to Rudy Grigar's opinions of almost everything, and whether you agree with them or not, you will come away from the book wishing you could meet Mr. Grigar. Written in a plain style, you quickly develop the feeling that with the author, what you see is what you get. I'm sure he is the kind of person I would enjoy spending the day on the bay with, and I'm glad he took the time to share his life with his readers."
3,Out of date.,"Mr.Grigar talks all the away through his book about the Gulf fishing as it was 50 years ago, but gives the current Gulf fisherman no advise or recommendations on today's methods for catching. He brags about all the fish he caught ( a million pounds ) and then berates others as a 'fish-hog'. I did not get much out of this book except stories about an old fisherman's glory days. Not recommended reading for anyone except history buffs."
5,The best book you will ever own in your life!,"This book is a power book of knowledge that everyone needs in their home. It has so much information on how to heal your self the natural way. It covers any ailment or question that you have about any health problem and how to naturally over come addiction of nicotine and ect. Get this book today, it will be a life saver, if not for you then for someone that you love."
4,Everything is in this book.,"A friend and I had seen this book in a health food store, and I searched for it on Amazon.com. It was a great price, of course, and the book is just full of information and remedies for what ails us. It's great!"
3,This book is a valuable resource.,"I have recommended and used this book for years. It is a wonderful resource, but only if teamed with common sense and additional research. Much of the dietary advice is extreme, seeming to encourage a vegetarian diet. I am not sure how realistic that approach is, and advise anyone reading the book to temper its advice with moderation. I also follow up with additional research on supplements, although this book does make the reader aware of possible side-effects. I look forward to reading the related books, as I can honestly say that this has been an aid to dealing with many health issues."
4,"Good for reference, but not a nutritional bible","The daily intake she recommends for many vitamins/minerals are a little high for my comfort; some easily exceed the Upper Intake Limit by the FDA and other sources I've researched. I started taking Zinc to boost my immune system, and after looking at recommended daily allowances of ZInc in other sources, I've decided to decrease my intake of it to every other day.That being said, she recommends a lot of great vitamin/herbal supplements that I had never heard of, which I love. The ""Conditions"" section is huge and is a great reference for almost any disorder. I do, however, find it impractical for someone to take the 30 different pills she recommends for any given ailment every day...In sum, I dont regret buying the book (herbal/nutritional healing is underestimated/ignored in our modern society) and will use it as a reference, but not a nutritional bible."
5,top notch medical reference book,"This is the fourth edition of this book and I have owned or do owneach of the prior three editions. Each subsequent edition has containeda greater wealth of information than its predocessor(s).This is a superior medical reference, that no home should be without.I have and continue to recommend this book to all my friends and family.Ms. Balch had a compassion for people and an amazing understandingof health and nutrition which resulted in an excellent body of work. Kudosto her and heart felt condolances to her family. She will be sorely missed!"
4,Remedies,"I like this book it has a lot of good stuff in it. You should get it and read it for your own good.Thanks,Bamidele Orogun - Thomas"
4,I'm converted,"I don't have a copy of this book, but I plan to buy one after witnessing what happened to my 91-year-old father. He entered a board and care facility weighing 111 pounds and was losing weight no matter how much he ate. He spent the entire day in bed and could not sit up unassisted. The doctors shrugged and told him it was old age. The caregivers at his facility began a food regimen that came from this book. (They did not discontinue his only medical prescription, which was for high blood pressure.) Two months later, he has stopped losing weight and is able to get out of bed and eat at the table. He enjoys the food he eats, has gone off daily laxatives, and can sit up by himself for longer and longer periods of time. Even his speech, which had been slurred, has improved, and he is more alert and less depressed. I have never believed in homeopathic remedies, and I would never replace my doctors completely, but I am very impressed with my father's experience."
4,"Prescription for Nutritional Healing, 4th Edition",We had earlier editions which we found quite valuable. This edition (4th) is no exception.
4,Essential Reading for Anyone Serious About Health,This is a wonderfully comprehensive book. The Balch's have done an excellent job of spelling it all out for us. A great basic alternative health book: everyone should have one at home.Patricia Skinnerhttp://www.wellwrittenwords.com
5,"The ""Bible"" of Nutritional Information","I was introduced to this book in 1998 by a nutritionist, and I soon bought a copy. Whenever my family has an ailment (that we recognize and know we can treat ourselves)the Balch's Prescription for Nutritional Healing is our first reference, and their prescription has usually solved the problem. It's also the standard reference book at most health food stores I've visited. Now I'm recommending it to visitors to my website, www.WomensMedicineBowl.com. It's indispensable when you're taking charge of your own well-being. --Beverly A. Jensen, Ph.D., President, WomensMedicineBowl.com"
5,Prescriptions for Nutritional Healing by James Balch,"I love this book. I have purchased one for each of my three daughters, who also love it! It is an excellent reference guide for so many health problems; with good advice and natural remedies."
4,Good book,"This is a really good book - great reading for anything that is bothering you medically. It will explain vitamins, minerals & any medical problems. This is the 2nd edition of this book I have bought & I turn to it any time that I need answers to my medical problems. Great read - definitely recommend!"
5,Prescription for nutritional healing fourth edition,"Best nutritional(help book)I have ever purchased.I am 60 years old. By following the information given, along with exercising and eating healthy food, I have already seen results for my arthritis pain,fibromyalgia and insomnia. It's a great book!"
5,I love this book!,"This book is amazing. I had an older edition and was excited to finally get this one. I know several people who have it, and I refer to it all of the time for personal health issues. I've taken supplements recommended for multiple health issues and have gotten positive results every time. The author thought of everything, and I mean everything. This is the best nutritional book I've ever seen and one that I wouldn't want to be without."
1,Misinformation,"First day I owned this book I noticed under ""Honey"" (page 73) the claim that honey was 35% protein! Are the authors insane? Honey contains no protein whatsover. It is sugar, has always been sugar and will always be sugar. (Look at the label on any honey you have ever purchased). With misinfomation like this on such basic elements as honey I shudder to think of the other bad advice I'll find beyond."
4,Tons of health information but no references,"The book's biggest weakness is that it has no list of references. So you can either take its health claims on faith or get on the Internet and start searching MEDLINE yourself. In that case, this book will work as a point of departure for doing your own research."
5,Prescription for Nutritional Healing,This is an excellent reference book for nutritional and natural healing. I had the 2nd edition for some time and updated it last year. Since then I have purchased three more 4th editions for friends and family. It is very comprehensive.
4,A Safe healing method,I was looking for a book on safe healing. That is with no chemicals. Then I found this book in the internet. I bought it and use it as a guidance for different types of illness. Surprisingly it worked. So I shared those contents that I have experienced with several friends who later requested me to get buy the book for them. I bought them and gave them to my friends for free. Altogether I have bought 4 books and will be buying another one soon.
4,Healthy Hints,"This is a great reference guide for anything that ails you.You can use it before going to the doctor, or try your luck at the many home remedies. It is very informative and helps one to live a long and productive life. I have the original and the updated volume, I use both, depending on the subject matter. I did not give it five stars since I like a little more of an 'Asian' flair to my health remedies. It is worth the money, though, and I feel I have reaped the benefits over and over and have recouped my original investment."
1,I was disappointed,"This book was a disappointment to me. I have the 4th edition, and was hoping to find new information on tryptophan. Nope, same mistakes as the previous edition, and same dated material regarding it still being banned in the US. This book comes from the estate of Phyllis, and I suppose that explains why the info is incorrect about the tyrptophan - tryptophan is currently available at most vitamin shops."
4,very helpful book,"This book is full of health information written so everyone can understand it. It has explainations of many diseases and syndromes, arranged in an easy to find manner. It also has list of supplements, what they are and when to use them. I use it at least once a week. I purchased this book for a gift since I already own one."
5,No doctors visits unless necessary!,Great information for keeping you healthy without prescription drugs! I use it daily! Fantastic reference.
5,Awesome Guide....,"I've owned this book for over a year now and have found it to be loaded with exceptional information!!It's the perfect book for those wanting to try an ""alternative"" approach to regular medicine...kinda like using Naturopathy.This book is direct, concise, and very basic. I have utilised it for many different situations and have found that the results were exactly as stated.Although it recommends products by a brand/company name (which seems like they're pushing a certain company), using another has proven just as effective!I highly recommend this book as a take-along to any health food store!!"
4,Great reference for supplements!,"In a search to help my son diagnosed on the autism spectrum and to help my daily pain as a result of fibromyalgia and other disorders, I ordered this guide. I can not attest to whether it has helped my son (we have seen many changes, but he also has had increases in therapy) but it has helped my anxiety/depression tremendously to take some of the recommended supplements as well as my insomnia and fibromyalgia."
3,"Okay, but not great","I thought this book was okay, but I wouldn't call it a classic. I did hold onto it, and it is on my bookshelf, but I rarely refer to it. When I do, it's just to get a basic description of an illness, not for the remedies it recommends. I felt like it just repeated what everybody else is saying, and didn't really have any original information to offer."
4,i want this book!,"i've read parts of this book this book, and i also own the second edition. the only reason i'm not buying this book right now is that the ISBN number is NOT 1-58333-083-6. i use this book in my business as a nutritional advisor and the trade paperback isn't sturdy enough. when you get this book in the comb binding, please inform me; the longer i don't have it the more it costs me."
2,Used book,I paid 99 cents for this book plus 13.00 to ship. It was a damaged book. The edges of the book had been water damaged so the pages do stick a bit. So used scissors to cut off the damaged cover and page edges but am able to use the book no problem.
4,Good Health Knowledge,"Prescription for Nutritional Healing is an excellent resource book.Whether you want to increase your knowledge on nutrition or improve your health,thhis is the book to have and add to your library.Cromwell Parris"
4,Good Advice,"This book contains advice on a broad range of illnesses, and is a resource for those illnesses where the regular medical profesion has given up. e.g. macular degeneration: I know one person who was told the he'd be blind in 2 years- but has fought this off for over ten years, using approaches found in this book. His sight has not improved - but it has not become any worse since the pronouncement.Margaret Blair"
4,Nutritional reference guide,"This is a practical and easy-to-read reference guide that provides natural remedies for common health problems. Each health problem is listed in alphabetical order so it is easy to locate throughout the book. I use it on a regular basis in addition to seeing my family medical doctor.You will find listings on topics such as Allergies, Anemia, Depression, Hypoglycemia, Insomnia and Irritable Bowel Syndrome just to name a few.Examples:For Anemia, did you know that Blackstrap molasses is high iniron and essential B vitamins? For Insomnia, did you know that foods such as turkey, bananas, figs, dates, yogurt, tuna or grapefruit help to promote sleep? Did you know that Chamomile is one of the herbs effective in the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome?You will find information like this and more......"
1,You've got to be kidding,"This can't be the same movie the other reviews are talking about ... or they're all friends of the kids that made it. Without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. Looks like a bunch of college students borrowed a video camera from a parent; the acting is so stiff it can barely be called acting; the sound is horrible ... too loud in some places, then to quiet in others. Unless you're up for a really good laugh, skip this one."
3,Good referece book,"This book covers lots of open source web services...although not in detail, its a good book for intermediate professionals who want to switch between technologies. Good coverage of UDDI, SOAP, WSDL technologies and also covers wide range of languages and servers for quick reference.Though seems to jump abruptly between topics, which could be due to targeted audience of experienced developers, this one seems to try to motivate open source efforts in light of the hype around .NET and J2EE."
1,Not quite up there,"I purchased this book as the topic seemed innovative. Butas it turned out, neither the technology that addressed the subject nor the book was quite up there. I couldn't find anything interesting beyond the fact that it was just another Web Services book. Each chapter in the book read like incomplete articles.The only chapter that caught my eye was the one dealing with SOAP::LiteFor anyone serious about web services, i would recommend Java web Serices from ORA."
1,Not of any use whatsoever:,"There is a serious lack of understanding that web services are not the be all and end all of software development,and that though they have distinct advantages, they also have their own quirks and disadvantages (esp. lack of proper implementationsbeing very pert to a book of this nature) - This book is a complete slave to the hype.When i bought this title i expected something very innovative, but at the end of reading it all i am thoroughly disgusted.Someone please explain to me (or correct me on) why chapters on Python, Ruby etc figured in this book - I figured thatthey crept in simply to maintain the client and server presentation through all langauages. This approach was not only badon all trees that were felled but also deceived the reader with insertions of flaky and immature implementations. The gist isfor the webservices fraternity is to ""wait"" for a truly professional book to appear on this subject."
2,packaging problems,"exactly same problem as the review bellow, I have order 8 pcs. and all wore packed separately in a bubble wrap + cardboard."
1,Item Arrived Poorly Packed and Bent,The item was just packed in bubble wrap and was badly bent when it arrived. To make matters worse I order two of them and they were shipped seperately and both arrived bent. It they had been shipped as a single item they would not have been so badly bent.
1,Item was packaged incorrectly and arrived bent (even on the second effort),"Should be packaged in a tough fiberboard tube. I had to shop locally and special order a ""straight"" one. Ouch."
2,Difficult to get chocolate out,Had to use tons of chocolate to fill the cavity and it was hard to get the whole thing out in one piece. Parts would break off and I would have to reattach them after.
4,Mexican Detectives,I really liked it. Héctor is such a cool and sometimes clumsy character. Very funny moments. A good description of the 80s Mexico city devastated by the earthquake.
2,Hair color for men,"This product color does not last as long as they claim, especially on very gray hair. Also, they no longer include the brush and cup for coloring mustache and/or beard, a reall draw back. Since I mainly color my mustache I used to use only a portion of the mix each time but now the larger bottle has a snap off top so you can't reseal it and use the rest later. I may try some other product next time since Clairol has gone cheap on this one (no brush, no cup, can't use part and save the rest)."
1,Ending ruins it all,"Well directed. Well acted. Story is intriguing all the way to the end and then it becomes predictable. On top of it all, when did we become so obsessed with the terrorists winning. I really don't think it is deep or artsy, but rather selfish and insulting of the script writers. That is all just my opinion of course. Another example of how a potentially good movie is ruined by lazy script writing which produced a horrible ending."
1,Another Buried Movie,"People alive in boxes whether buried or not have shown up in a few movies the past couple of years, e.g. ""Buried"". This one had more techy stuff (camera, phone, CB radio, annoying red LED clock) and had the more elaborate plot of trying to extort information from it's (How did I get here?) occupant. Just like a person in a box not knowing what's going on, this viewer felt like they were in a box in being mostly clueless and bored 90% of the time while watching just a person in a box with only increasingly predictable dialogue to keep from dozing off. To make it worse the writer & director tossed in two twists at the end that not only were stupid-unrealistic but made the preceding 91 of 92 minutes seem even stupider."
1,brake,One of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my life. Terrible . Movie stinks I will probably never rent another movie from Amazon
2,A one actor movie in a car trunk.,"All the other actors appear in the last few minutes of the movie. I guess if you are a Stephen Dorff fan and enjoy looking up his nostrils for over an hour then this is the movie for you. Tom Berenger is the size of a whale and can't find a tie long enough to reach to his belt. A copy of ""Buried"" and less interesting. An IFC Film so look for it on Netflix in the next 3 months or so."
2,"Fake, all the way","Come on. The guy doesn't act like he works in any position that requires control. I didn't believe he was SS. The film really ""fell apart"" towards the end. He just so happens to glance at something towards the end, and the entire team gets lucky, and then stuff happens? What a joke. At least it ended with a bit of excitement, and the guy who was willing to let his wife die for some stranger gets what's coming to him. Gosh, what a horrible story. What ever happened to the US terrorists anyway?"
2,Ending destroys the movie,"Stephen Dorff is stuck inside the trunk of a car. He is a Secret Service agent with information about where the President goes in case of an emergency. After guarding this information throughout the entire film (under some very difficult circumstances), something unbelievable happens and ruins the movie. For a much better film about a person stuck in a box/confined space, recommend checking out Buried with Ryan Reynolds."
2,Claustrophobia is still not my thing.,"Stuck in a box for the whole movie, Stephen Dorff should get an oscar for that, except, the plot, it won't win any awards, guaranteed. They should show the movie to a handful of movie goers, and then ask for suggestions before it is released. Especially ask for ideas on an ending. It gets old quickly. Tom Berenger, only two minutes in the movie? Really? Thumbs down on the ending, thumbs up though on Stephen Dorff."
5,BRAKE,"A truly exciting thriller! And ORIGINAL! So tired of seeing the same thriller plot over and over. Unique concept with great performances, direction, and editing. Will see again and buy when the DVD is avilable. Five stars, 'both thumbs up! WAY UP'"
4,"Props for Directing, Storyline and Performance",Props to Timothy Mannion for a story well crafted that I never would have expected!Props to director Gabe Torres as it had to be rather difficult to direct a guy in a car trunk and he did a great job!Props to the performance that Stephen Dorff did in this movie! He had such little room to work but pulled off a truly good performance! I believe Stephen Dorff was an executive producer for this film as well.
2,amazing nonsense,I was baffled from the outset about this movie. the plot was simply unbelievable and slow. The plot centered around a special agent who processed more bravado than James Bond. This was a waste of viewing time and the ending was very weak. A terrorist plot that even Bin Laden would laugh at!!
2,Don't buy until this gets fixed terrible on my Zoom pad!,"I started watching on PC, then switched to Xoom, this does not work. Finding the video is no easy task on my Amazon home page either. I was watching this series on Netflix on both my PC desktop and on my Xoom. When I ran out of seasons on Netflix, found it on Amazon. I am a regular amazon customer and spend thousands per year on equipment for my business.... I started at season 5 EP 18? I was on 2! This need some serious fixing. The video quality is much better on Amazon, I will them credit for this."
1,Burn Notice,The show was good until it stopped for some unknown reason. A message to install Flash Player appeared. My computer would not allow that install. so noe I can't finish watching a show I paid for.
1,wastedmoney,"I was hesitant to buy this or just get the DVD, shoulda just got the dvd.. video doesnt work tried for 2 hours on windows 7 upgraded everything, never gonna trust amazon again"
1,WTH?,Ok... so when can I start purchasing season 5? Never had to wait this long to start ordering the season. The premiere was lastnight.
4,Stronger than last season,"I was getting a bit worried about Burn Notice after the introduction of Jesse last season. Fortunately, the writers realized that he works better back in the background, and we get a nice recovery with Season 5. Michael finally faces his ultimate villain, setting up the final battle in Season 6 with Anson.The special feature on some of the villains was great, but no Simon?The 6th Season would make a good place to finish. Personally, I'd love to see Fi and Mike on the lam. And happy as they are together."
2,"Good show, terrible delivery","The show itself is good, but the amazon delivery system is horrendous. The video randomly stops and downgrades quality, despite flash being allocated unlimited cache space. Which brings us to the underlying problem- flash. Maybe my i7 processor is not sufficient, perhaps 16gb of ram is not enough, ssds in raid might not have the speed, and 50mb might be insufficient Internet bandwidth. Of course if any of these are the case then it just goes to show how inefficient flash is. I would recommend using iTunes or even Netflix if you actually want to watch a show with decent quality and without stuttering."
2,DVD scratched,"Love the series. The DVD's were scratched, made it miserable to watch. We like to watch this series on our family nights. Totally bummed that the DVS's were not in better shape. Sad Face.."
3,Burn Notice Season 5,"I love Burn Notice, but season five was not as good as 2,3 or 4 and in my opinion its because all the good villains are dead...and all of Michael's "" Shadow Government"" contacts are dead as well. Like Strickler, Carla, .Also his enemies like,"" Dead Larry "", Victor, and my favorite..."" BRENNEN "", unless they come up with some more villains the show is gonna fall off..."
3,What happened to Michael's hair?,"We don't watch much tv, but we loved Burn Notice and watched all of the first 4 seasons on Netflix. We thought that was the end - when Michael was invited back to the CIA - and were thrilled to find out there was a 5th season. The main attraction of this show, in my opinion, is the relationship among the main characters - they remind me of the mod squad. We can put up with Sam's ridiculous beard and Mom's occasional bad hair days, but Michael Weston has to look good, and his hair was just too bad to put up with. A pity. We probably won't even finish the season."
5,Excellent show,"This show is addictive. I watched the first few seasons on Netflix steaming, and despite being sure that this season would be added shortly, I couldn't wait any longer and had to buy it. Definitely worth it!"
5,"Adventure, Romance, Humor, Spies, Explosions -- Love it all!","The premise of this series is basically the life of one ""burned"" spy, Michael Weston, and the family and friends around him. It takes place primarily in Miami and has all the elements of great story-telling. In addition to various ""missions"", the characters are really well developed and mature over the course of each season. I won't explain ""burned"" -- it might make one more person watch to find out! This is a series for both men and women."
5,Good smart action.,This season had one of the best bad (Anson) guys of any tv series. This might be my favorite burn notice seasons.
5,good stuff,great series. great season. can't wait for more seasons. Let's hope it has a nice long run on USA network.
5,Awesome Espionage!,Season 5 will leave you wanting more in Season 6! I love this season because of the passion delivered by Fiona and the new twist we see in all of our favorite characters.
4,Very good show,"As with nearly all of Burn Notice programs, I liked this episode very much. The acting is terrific, but sometimes if you watch with a very critical eye, you notice in some scenes the show creators take a bit too much license in defying the viewer's common sense. I don't have a big problem with that, as the entertainment value of this show far exceeds the occasional glitch with common sense. After all, this is fiction. My rating today is four stars plus."
4,Episode was kind of cheesey,"The main plot of this episode was kind of cheesey. I liked previous episodes better. Slightly interesting was the main story arc about Michael being framed for Max's murder. I thought some of the actors were pretty funny. The characters though didn't all behave very rationally. It would have been nice if the storylines were a little more believeable. The way the father jeopardized his son's health and then suddenly got beaten and changed his mind really didn't make that much sense to me. It was kind of a rush plot. I guess there's not much you can do in 1 hour episode. Generally, though this series is pretty good. I probably will keep watching."
5,Burned spies help people,"Burner for life! Burn Notice is so greatly acted. I swear it's not acting because it's that great of acting. This show's story it so well planned and written. You never know what's going to happen next. I love the narration during the show. I love how they put captions under people after they just called them something. It has a video game feel to it, but truly the human feel too. If you haven't seen this show I don't know what planet you've been living on, but watch it. Once you've started you get hooked."
3,Innocent behind every rock,Well written stories from the early 20th century. A good example of Hemingway's style. The stories are believable and enjoyable. Wasn't comfortable with the flashbacks to the Spanish Civil War or the bullfighting tales. I'm sure there is a hidden meaning there.
4,Very nice collection of Hemingway stories,This is a very nice starter set of Hemingway stories. He set the standard for short declarative sentences that really pack a punch. I thought the Big River stories didn't hold my interest enough but the character development was fantastic in all the stories and his depiction of war and of bullfighting was riveting.
3,"It arrived a little late, but it's ok","This book arrived within the delivery time, but in relation to my needs it arrived a few days later than I had hoped. However, the transaction was smooth and the book was in GREAT condition! All in all I was happy!"
3,"Not bad, but not the best","I read this collection of short stories for my AP English class. Each story in the book is set around the time of World War 1. Although some of the stories deal with the trauma that verterans suffer, Hemingway's minimalistic writing style tends to downplay the emotional aspect of what his characters are going through. A few of Hemingway's short stories sparked my interest, but for the most part, I was filled with a sort of indifference while reading the other stories. I would recommend this book, because it does give certain insight into characteristics of people living around the time of World War 1. However, the reader should be warned to take this book for what it is, and not expect anything extraordinary."
1,Hated it.,"I am not a fan of Hemingway anyway, and this book only solidified that feeling. Lots of confusing story lines. Very little words. I know about the 7/8 theory, and I think it's a load. War stories as told by an adle minded old fart. The end."
3,Interesting read,"It was interesting to read one of Hemingway's first published works. It was not, however, of the caliber of his novels written later. I'm not sorry I read it though."
3,"In Our Time, a classic collection of short stories.","In Our Time by Ernest Hemingway is a collection of short stories set amidst a time after the period of World War I. Several of Hemingway's early classics are included in this incredible novel such as ""Indian Camp,"" ""The Battler,"" and ""The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife."" If the reader can look past the drinking scenes, each individual story presents a variety of characters, themes and plots, all of which deal with different aspects of life. His unique style of short, simple and declarative sentences enables easy reading for any person. Hemingway, as a man, writes with dignity and a genuine mansculine charm. The stories of love lost, relationships, nature and war are intense-- recommended In Our Time, a classic."
5,My favorite Bolitho yet!,"I've yet to read a Richard Bolitho book that I did not thoroughly enjoy. This one is my favorite one so far. It's full of the attention to detail, superb phrasing, and outstanding character description and development that Kent/Reeman's readers have grown accustomed to.This work is a glittering example of why Bolitho is one of the most well-crafted and developed characters I've read. He is truly a classic hero, and with it is truly human with no trace of the superman tendencies which a lesser writer would use with the resulting lack of believability. Bolitho's foibles and imperfections are used here to great advantage.The result is that I look forward to setting sail again with Bolitho more than ever. Any admirer of good fiction should be greatly pleased that the entire series is being reprinted and being made available in U.S. editions."
4,Signal Close Action,The continuing saga of Richard Bolitho in this the 13th book about him is very exciting and well written. I am not sure how Bolitho keeps surviving all the harrowing experiences but he always seems to come through heroicly but scarred.
4,Almost perfect.,"I would have given this five stars but the two deck of cards it came with were horrible, they were like paprer thin & the keys for the case seem to fit but not lock the case? Aside from that, the case it self is great, the chips are awesome & plus the design on them is cool too."
3,good chips without blinds,"Chips are good and Case seems strong.Shipping is fast too. But there are no blind chips, otherwise it is a good value buy."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"If you are a fan of this genre of music (i.e., heavy neo-classical), this is a ""must have"" for your collection. The major strength of this recording over those of others in the same class, in my opinion, is the quality and arrangement of the songs. For this reason, this is my favorite Shrapnel instrumental release. Make no mistake - Joey is an incredible guitarist - in fact, he can pick blinding staccato runs and smooth, liquid legato (Holdswothesque!) lines with apparently equal ease. Another strength of this CD is some equally incredible bass work - easily some of the best I've heard in a rock/metal context. I was surprised to find out it wasn't Sheehan playing bass - yes, that's how good Wally Voss is on this CD! Actually, all of the musicianship is top-drawer."
5,Perfect battery,I bought this battery because it was the closest one to my camera's original battery. It fits in the charger that came with the camera battery and charged with no issues. I still have it in my camera and have yet had to charge it again. Very good product and the seller was very prompt on getting it to me. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
3,"Music for Popular Consumption in the 20s and 30s, not the real folk deal","I bought this thinking I would get an amazing library of Irish tunes to learn. Instead, it was comedy routines and ""I love me whiskey"" songs and only a few instrumental tunes, with most of the song and instrumental tracks having a jokey piano accompaniment played by someone who totally disregards their harmonic direction - inevitably muddy noise ensues. So, get this if you want a period flavor but be prepared to hear a lot of junk from a time when people were trying to make Irish music sound like normal European pop music instead of just picking a good drone and letting these interesting old music styles be."
4,minnetonka silverthorne thong,I wish shoe makers would make 1/2 sizes. i purchased a 9b and it fit a little loose. I wear a 8 1/2 shoe and a 8 would have been to small and a 9 is a little to big. What is the problem with shoe makers making 1/2 sizes in these type shoes. Other wise the shoe feel good and since it is hard to find a red shoe in that style I like it.
2,Minnetonka Women's Silverthorne Thong 13B White,"I bought this thong in a 13 B (medium), and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top. My toes still curl over the top, just not as much. The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe, and actually broke the skin. They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on. I am guessing, though, that that is the nature of any flip-flop. I bought these because I do not like flip-flops, and wanted something a little more classy. It certainly looks nice, but I will never buy a flip-flop again."
3,"Good detail, well-written, not well edited","This 122-page survey of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslakia is very readable and full of interesting details.It is marred, however, by sloppy editing (numerous misspellings, and the name of the Soviet Ambassador to the US ismisspelled ""Dobryin"" every time). Brezhnev is always spelled ""Breshnev""The author obscures the multi-ethnic nature of the Soviet Union by using ""Russian"" when ""Soviet"" wouldbe correct: worst was the statement, ""Many Russians are Slavs, too"" and calling soldiers from Tashkent, Odessa,Leningrad, ""Mongolia"", and Armenia generically ""Ivan Ivanovich"".The biographical sketch of Dubcek at the end borders on the hagiographic. He is called ""saintly"" and ""thenoblest Slovak""."
3,Broken Case,Shipped on time and the actual CD was in good condition (no scratches or marks) but the case was in terrible condition. A little disapointed.
3,Evolving . . . I guess.,"The first half of the tracks were pretty boring, not catchy and ran together for me the first few listens. I didn't really feel like the Cartel I know and love came through until ""Wasted"" and then carried through the rest of the album.However, with each listen, it becomes more familiar and I'm really starting to appreciate it."
3,"Big hopes, small splash","Well, I had high hopes for this album after first hearing ""Lose It"" a few months back. I was a little disapointed with Will's vocals. He doesnt really push them hard like in Chroma. Is it me or does alot of the songs sound the same? I have a bit of a drive in the morning, so when I was listening to it, it wasn't long before I was at track 5 and hadn't even noticed the songs inbetween.I fell in love with Chroma within a days, but so far it's been a week and I still don't really like it. When you're stuck in a bubble for 20 days, I guess this is the type of music that comes out. Their whole publicity stunt sold me and that was their aim.........."
2,Not as good as Chroma,"This album is kinda stupid. It's boring, faceless, and seems like almost no effort was put into it. Stick with Chroma- it's a much better CD than this one."
2,Not the Best,"For Voyager fans seeing the pic of Capt Janeway on the cover taking up a full quarter of the front would lead them to believe that 25% or so of the story was decided to her. Not so. For Star Trek fans who have to read EVERY single book, it's a must, but for most, just a mishmash and rehash of old story lines."
2,An Intriguing Concept Marred By Poor Plotting,"""The Brave and the Bold: Book 2"" is Keith DeCandido's epic Star Trek saga encompassing the crews from all of the Star Trek television series. It is a hokey premise about the discovery of mysterious alien artifacts, ""Malkus Artifacts"", which are the last vestiges of a power-hungry ruler and a civilization dating from 90,000 years before the 24th Century. The first half is a somewhat engaging look at the discovery of the third of these artifacts, featuring Captain Robert DeSoto of the USS Hood and Lieutenant Tuvok from USS Yoyager a few weeks prior to Voyager's ill-fated mission in the Badlands. It also includes some riveting scenes with members of the Maquis. The second half is a disappointing reunion of Colonel Kira Nerys, Ambassador Worf, Ambassador Spock and Admiral McCoy as they fall under the spell of the fourth artifact, found on the Klingon colony world Narendra III. This was a quick diversion on a long New York City subway ride."
3,"The Kabbalah, for the people","I have been hearing about Kabbalah for about a year now, because of the ""Madonna Factor"", but this is the first time I took the step to find out what it is about. It offers an introduction to the spirituality it encompasses. I learned so much about myself just by reading it. There are personal stories of how letting G-d into your life can make a change, that you can develop your soul and become a stronger, healthier person. Thank you Dr. Kramer for bringing this to a larger audience."

5,The Luck of the Irish / I'll Never Forget You {1948} dvd,"I love the movie, I'll Never Forget You {1948}, I saw it as a young girl and it was just wonderful seeing it again after so many years. It got here quickly and in perfect shape. Good quality for the money."
1,Double-Sided Recording of Luck of the Irish and I'll Never Forget You,"This 1948 version of the Luck of the Irish is a great movie. I have seen it before on TV. However, this double-sided version of two movies has terrible sound quality. There is an echo with every word. It was pretty expensive for such poor quality."
3,unusual movie,"I started buying Italian movies a couple years ago before a trip to Italy, and this was the most unusual of the ones I got. The acting was fine, the location and filming were very good, but the killing of defenseless family members was disturbing. I didn't really enjoy this movie, but I'm not one who watches many movies involving violence and murder."
2,An early controversial Italian work,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Fists in the Pocket, released in Italy as ""I Pugni in tasca"", is the story of a dysfunctional Italian family and has been both praised and condemned.The story is about a man who makes attempts to murder his blind mother and epileptic brother. The film has been praised for innovation and condemned for mockery of the family which is almost sacred in Italian culture.I did not like the film for this reason.The DVD contains interviews with director Marco Bellocchio, editor Silvano Agosti, actor Lou Castel, actor Paola Pitagora and film critic Tullio Kezich. The DVD also has a theatrical trailer and an afterward by Bernardo Bertolucci.This film remains controversial and is not for everybody."
5,Perfect Lamb charm,"I purchased this Lamb charm for my daughter's Twilight bracelet and it is absolutely lovely. Rembrandt does it again! Precious Accents, as always, was a pleasure to deal with, and you can't beat their free shipping."
1,Tabloid fodder!,It's amazing how these people crawl out of the woodwork after people are dead and can't dispute or defend themselves. Don't waste your money!
1,trash thru and thru,"why would anyone unless seeking attention, put this garbage in a book? I mean really, plastic surgery to look like a man your sleeping with? how sick is that...God must be so hurt as he did not make us to live like this...this book is really not for anyone to read....i read only a preview as i thought it was going to be a life of liberace and not what it turned out to be...so in the trash where he should be...."
1,Garbage,How can someone write a book that is full of half truths and lies. I guess people will do anything to sell a book and make money. This book needs to be thrown out with the trash.
1,Might as well buy a tabloid for less money,What a liar this guy is who writes a bunch of trash. I was just reading some articles online which he totally contradicts himself over and over to fit whatever the fame whore is trying to accomplish at the moment. This book isn't worth reading even if you got it free at a yard sale.
3,A real keepsake for any QE fan!,"A Queer Eye DVD collection would not be complete with this...although it doesn't contain as many humorous outtakes as the others, until complete season DVDs become available, I'll take it!"
3,Good,"I liked this tea, its very nice. I have to give it 3stars though, because despite my hopes...it didnt taste too much like lavender. Smells like it in thhr package, but once u make the tea it mainly just tastes like camomile. Still, a great tea though!"
4,fun but hard,it took me 4 hours of straight building to finish it its my second build so the hobby is kinda new to me but its very fun i painted the car lime green and didint put the stickers an it there kinda cheap looking but everything was fun dont buy this for a 10 year old unless there crazy smart lol it was a fun project I DEFFINATLY RECOMMEND THIS MODEL
5,Good Value,"Good Value, durable product. This item performed as well as any other sheet protector I have used, but at a better price."
2,"For the plot is hollow, and I have seen much better","This one is pretty weak overall. The ultra-aggressive high priestess gets McCoy to marry her within a few days, but hours later, she encourages him to leave. The oracle has the ability to ""zap"" the boys, but when they go for the book at the end, it only yells at them, ""NO! STOP!"" Pretty decent idea, rather poorly executed, McCoy utterly passionless as the man ""in love""."
3,Interesting premise,"This is similar in some ways to ""Return of the Archons"" or ""The Apple"" in that a humanoid society is under the control of a computer. Where this story diverges from those is with the asteroid ship and the back story of the Fabrini.In addition, we get a rare treat in this episode: McCoy, not Kirk, falls in love!One of the better episodes of Star Trek's third season."
5,Wonderful,"Excellent CD for anyone that loves groovy, jazzy and funky moods in music. You will enjoy this one! And your friends will be dying to know where you got it!"
4,It was an OKAY book!,"The book was pretty okay. It is true what they say about money can't buy love and friends. When you try to do this, people will hate you and you will lose friends instead of gaining them. So, read it. This book and every other book carries a valueble leason which we must learn in order to succeed in life. Luv, Lucky Thirteen"
4,nice watch,it is rather big and u may have to remove a few links to get a good fit. but it looks good
2,poor quality,"The number ring on the bazel fell off after only 3 months. It appears to have been glued on. This watch was to replace a Seiko's Dives that had provided good service for over 15 years. Not the same quality but paid about the same. Paid more than going internet price. On the plus side, time keeping of the watch was perfect"
3,"Pulido great, But!","Would of been a perfect collection, unfortunatethat Nina No Te Pintes and Senorita Cantineraare offered in live performance which does neithertune any justice....Why replace an awesome studioversion with what sounds more like a jam session?"
5,Tea-Pro is a must have if you have any animals at home,"Years ago one of my dogs had been torn up very badly by another dog, one wound was 18"" long around his shoulders/neck. After over 2 months and 2 different vets the wounds were just not healing closed as they should. I was in the local feed store picking something up and chatting about it with one of the other customers. The lady behind the counter suggested I try this directly into the wounds twice a day.I was sceptical, but also at my witts end trying to get my poor puppy to heal, so I tried it. Within 3 days there was obvious healing and within 3 weeks the wounds were all closed.I have used it many times since then, most recently on an alpaca with an open, draining abscess on his jaw. All I can say it is works, far better than I expected, and far better than anything that was recommended for such an abscess.Try it."
3,"Yeah, great speed and shred, but there's something missing","I don't know, maybe it's the fact that i listened to it after knowing malmsteen, jason becker, al di meola, steve vai, joe satriani, symphony x, dream theater ann so on...Paul Gilbert is great, but i get bored with this one so easily."
2,Low Production,"Excuse me for my English, but I speak spanish usually. I think that Paul Gilbert & Co have done better getting a productor who knows them more."
5,Wonderful girlfriend book.,"This book of poetry was given to me by a friend when I moved away from my hometown. It is filled with wonderful, insightful poetry that touches the heart. Since receiving it, I have gotten other copies to pass on to my friends for special events or just because.One of my favorite examples is on the back cover of my copy:""Half the Fun?'Getting thereis half the fun!'Not if you'reon a diet....""When you get this book - enjoy! You will read it time and again."
3,Dealing with family illness and homosexuality while acting in Rent.,"This book is by Anthony Rapp, who played Mark in the stage and movie versions of Rent. It deals largely with his relationship with his mother as she deals with cancer (ultimately dying of the disease) and with his homosexuality. It is a very personal and well written book. It does talk some about the experience of being in Rent but focuses more on his family than on the show itself; if your interest is in the show Rent, this might not be the book for you."
4,Honest and Emotional look into the heart and soul.,"I loved this book. Give it 4 /2 stars actually. Very interesting story of how Anthony joined the cast of RENT. Especially good for us ""RENTheads"". Any person intrested in the theatre will be facinated in the process RENT took from a theatre workshop to be a smash Broadway show with comand performances by the President.I was moved to tears by his words as his raw emotions came out in dealing with Jonathan's death.Also included is a very open and honest account of Anthony's sexuality. (a bit to graphic for me at times which is the only reason this is not getting 5 stars) and a very real and moving account of his relationshop with his mother.While I think those involved in the theatre and RENTheads will get the most out of this book. It is a good, very emotional read."
2,Rent fans Beware!!!,"Somewhat hard to follow . . . Had its good and bad moments. Hated that Rapp jumped around, talking about his fame during Rent, his childhood and then back to Rent. Went into graphic details about his sexual life. Very touching moments about his mother and her battle with cancer and the tragic sudden death of Jonathan Larson."
1,without you : a memoir,"Great read for all of the Rent Heads out there . This book tells the personal side of Anthony Rapp as well as his interaction with the Rent cast ,including Johnathan Larson."
5,WOW!!!!,"What a fabulous spilling of the sould. Anthony let it all come out in such stark detail that you could feel his joy but also feel all the pain with him. It is a very easy read, very well written. Thank you Anthony! You have bore your sole in a way that people can relate your feelings to situations in their own lives."
3,"Touching, Raw, but slightly drawn out","Though his raw and open prose was heartfelt, at times I hoped for a little less repetition of the same words and themes. The repeated mention of crying, sobbing, and slick, hot tears covering his face, for instance, soon left me numb to the real pain behind those tears because it happened so often throughout the book.The detail on his string of former love interests seemed verbose at times. Rapp's description of his tumultuous relationship with Todd seemed especially belabored. The same themes and ideas surrounding the relationship would be present even if some of the prose was cut.Despite this criticism, I would recommend this book to fans of RENT, individuals dealing with grief, adolescents dealing with the confusion of sexual identity, and especially fans of Anthony Rapp."
5,Review,"This book is amazing. It's a great read, easy to follow and really hits at your heart. I would reccommend it to everyone."
5,A fantastic read,"Without You has got to be one of my favorite books, (which is saying something, considering I am a bookworm...). It takes you on an emotional journey through Anthony Rapp's life. The emotion in the book was so powerful that I cried during parts."
3,dissapointed,"For whatever reason I found myself somewhat dissapointed with the book. I was expecting to see more of ""Rent"" then I did. It's not written really well and in a lot of ways I think it makes Anthony come across different then what he really is, or so I hope. I have to remember that it is his memoir after all, and so if he wants to be self indulgent, I suppose he has the right to:)"
5,Amazing,"After reading this book I feel so close to Anthony. It's so well written and the person stories are told so well, it's as if you're having coffee with him. He's an amazing and talented guy!"
5,Honest and Interesting,"I love memoirs and ""Rent"" is my favorite musical. I was so excited when I saw Rapp had written a memoir! I had a hard time putting this book down. I think everyone will find parts of this novel that they can relate to. It's a great read."
4,Audio book suggested!,"This book really moved me with Rapp's emotional honesty, and I echo the praises from previous reviewers. I rate it as 4 stars because, like a previous reviewer suggested, I feel it tended to drag a bit at the end and could have ended a chapter earlier. I strongly suggest the audio recording, especially for fans of Rent and of Anthony. Hearing him read the story himself (particularly for the small and poignant personal moments, like the frequent ""Hi, Mama""--""Hi, Tonio"" exchanges with his mother--it broke my heart every time) was an intimate and powerful experience, and when I finished I felt I had just had a long and passionate conversation with a friend--which i was very sorry to end."
2,Mediocre,"Rosenwein does a good job displaying appropriate pictures, discussing the right time frame, and incorporating Eastern Europe and the Ottoman empire into typical Western European history. However, many details are left out while discussing kings and battles. Much is said about the thriving arts, and a great selection of paintings and works from the medieval period have been chosen for this text. However, None of the chapters flow easily, and jump from the west to the east, from the thriving univeristy concept to what is seldom said about popes at this time. Important information is discussed with limited detail. Large text and frequent large pictures take up much room in the text which could be used for more text. At time the reading level strays from middle school to college and back. It should have been expanded and edited by more collegues/scholars."
1,Cheated,"A fine book, but vendor sends ONLY VOLUME ONE for this price. You are better off using another source. The book itself is well-written and nicely illustrated. Maps are good, too."
3,Working well!,I've had this product installed and working for several months. I think the value of this product is very good.I've paid a lot more for these cartridges in the past (since 1995) and I'm satisfied with this one.
1,A Horrid Experience - Stay Away,"This had to be the most painful DVD experience I've ever had. The music on tis DVD was so idiotic it drowned out everything, making it completely incomprehensible.Equally as bad as the music the producer seemed to want video of himself walking about in almost every shot. Not to mention almost the entire dvd is made up of collages of images superimposed on top of one another, making none of them clear enough to even see correctly.I've bought hundreds of books and dvd's from Amazon and this is the first that has motivated me to actually post a review. It is that bad.I can't even comment on what the producer said, I couldn't hear any of it. Stay away would be my advice, a total waste of money."
1,U-N-W-A-T-C-H-A-B-L-E!!!!!!!!!,"Couldn't even get passed the second scene. I'm a very open minded person about this kind of stuff too, but the movie was completely overstimulating. A non-stop...(REALLY. non-stop. every scene in the movie is filmed this way).... montage of overlapping images and LOUD music that drowns out the narration.I REALLY wanted to watch this movie as I was very curious about the information on it.IT IS TOO HARD TO WATCH.Philip Gardiner lacks any and all GNOSIS when it comes to film direction.Truly. TRULY. AWFUL."
2,Horrible music,I agree with all the music comments it's absolutely annoying and at times you can't even hear the narrator!
2,The Presentation Killed the Message,"Being a fan of this type of history and lore, it pains me to say that this video was almost unwatchable. I did watch it all the way through to give it a fair chance but in the end, the presentation just killed the experience.The music was too loud when the narrator spoke, and the narrator's voice was just not distinct enough to make the information come alive (very monotone). The video looked like it had been done on a home PC prior to the ""new and improved"" video imaging software was available.None of it made sense, even to me being a fan of this type of genre. I gave it 2 stars based on the information alone (only because I know it). I am not accustomed to being this critical on topics that interest me, but I cannot in good faith recommend buying this video. If your curiosity is burning to see it, then I would suggest borrowing from a friend or checking it out from the library (if they have it)."
1,"Busy, Confusing, Heavy Metal meets symbolic montage","Painful to watch, Superimposed photos of symbols floating around throughout the movie plus the loud music in the background made it hard to hear what the speaker was saying.When you finally could hear what he was saying it seemed that his grandiose style and arrogance made you wish the headbanger music was louder.A total pig. Stay away from this. It's like trying to watch the Blair Witch Project while in a bumpy airplane while you have a hangover.Amateurish production with a boring and busy monologue."
4,Glad I gambled,"I read some of the reviews before I purchased this...and I knew it was kind of a gamble. I feel like I won though, this was so interesting...I was concerned about the music being too loud to hear any information, but that's certainly not the case. This was a good, entertaining compilation of research on Solomon and surrounding subjects."
2,research,"I found this work to be boring and redundant .it was seemingly milking the same subject as many of this authors other works,and did not necessarily warrant a seperate publication to communicate the same information"
3,Gardiner Style,Another Gardnier style documentary with interesting information but lacking quality. Still worth your time and interest. Not so wordy that you feel lost. Good for experts and newbies alike. Gardnier put the responsibility for our lives and happiness in our own hands.
3,History Rewritten?,"Gnosis, this DVD explains, is not simply knowledge, as defined by some, but ""the experience of the divine as self,"" ""knowledge of the most esoteric kind."" Writer Phillip Gardiner asserts that ""present orthodox history is basically incorrect. Over the last few centuries, history has been rewritten by religious and political. Basically, says Gardiner, The ""winners"" get to write their story. The only negative is that the music sometimes drowns out the narration."
3,"good product, not what expected!","Not Amazon's fault, but this product, even though it had the same name as what the hairdresser used, did not perform as well. Could it be altered from the commercial product?"
4,Great option for those who do not want to look like they use hair products!,This product is great for men who want to add a little styling help to their hair without the look OR SMELL of traditional hair products.
2,Wandering in the fog,"I agree with the complaint about lack of index. Combined with the vague chapter headings, the reader really needs lots of telepathy or maybe just pre-existing knowledge to use this book as a resource. For every 10 times that I had difficulty in administering or using Project Server as a super user and I looked at this book, 9 times I walked away with no solution. I accomplished more by just trying things on my own, and Googling for hints."
4,Good easy to read book,this is a good book to learn the basics of Administering a PMO. Easy to read and in depth in key parts.
4,Plastic Tub,"This is a great item for feeding my livestock, ie, geese, pigeons, chickens. It's good for water and dry feed."
4,lots of fun,"This is a very good album of fiddle tunes that was recorded by three banjo greats--bela fleck, bill keith, and tony trischka. If you like fiddle tunes you should buy this."
3,the bluegrass summitt,"Okay, so a gathering of three generations of banjo wizards may not excite the way a summit of say, John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Charles Mingus might have. But the intent - to shake up the tradition of their form - is no less relevant. Celebrated in circles as diverse as bluegrass and progressive jazz, Fleck, Keith and Trischka take bawdy delight twisting these 16 traditional fiddle arrangements to suit the pick and pluck of their Appalachian, Irish and urban/mountain styles. Accompanied variously by fiddle, mandolin and bass, the three veteran players alternate between collaboration (Bill Cheatham, Salt Creek, John Hardy) and soloing with a rotating door of backing musicians (Dust On the Needle, Paddy Kelly's Jig, Silverbell, Mead Mountain Blues, Salty). It's a perfect combination, either as an alternative for fans of bluegrass or a great starting point for anybody interested in having at least one of these albums in the collection. This should be it."
3,1990,"Ice Cube dropped this EP a few months after N.W.A released 100 Miles and Runnin' just to show fans that he could match them step for step.""Dead Homiez"" and ""Jackin for Beats"" were the singles.These 7 tracks are included on the re-masterd version of AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, so just buy that and get all the songs."
3,Not as good as the last one I owned,"This is an ok heat pack. But the last one I owned (purchased years ago at Crabtree & Evelyn) smelled nicer, stayed hot longer, and remained dry when heated. This pack does the job and there's nothing wrong with it, but is just average in my opinion."
1,Do not overheat this product,Heating for 2 minutes made this warm but not very warm. So i heated it for 3 minutes and it must have toasted the herbs inside. Now it stinks of burnt toast and the smell will not go away. I have other heat pads/bags which can be heated for this long and do not emit a burnt smell. Very disappointing.
4,Hot/cold comfort pac,"This item works great. It was a little bigger than I thought it would be, but it works just fine and it has helped a lot."
2,Not quite what I expected,While the pack smells great it doesn't hold the heat long enough. I thought it would have rice or cherry pits in it that would hold the heat longer for better relief.
4,Martin and Amanda-SPOILERS,"Favorite scene with Amanda-Letting Percival Lytton-Smythe have it.Favorite scene with Martin-Finding the unsent letters from his father. Being forgiven.Together-Discovering the truth about Martin while in Scotland.What did you like about Amanda-She was really the only person who stood by Martin. She was strong and stubborn (although too stubborn about marriage). And although it was stupid, I still admired her for taking risks and going places she shouldn't have gone and doing things she shouldn't have done.What didn't you like about Amanda-That she waited the whole book to tell Martin she'd marry him. Why was she so stubborn about marriage?What did you like about Martin-His love and protection for Amanda. Despite what his own father had done to him, Martin still loved him.What didn't you like about Martin-That he didn't believe that Edward could be the villain.If I had to cast Amanda, I'd cast Reese Witherspoon.If I had to cast Martin, I'd cast Julian McMahon."
4,Superb!,"I liked this book. This was my first novel I read by Stephanie Laurens, and it was a welcome change from my previous novels.I liked her style of writing, literate and polished, not having a high school drop out kind of english!It had the right mix of characterisation and sensuality,which made the love scenes sizzle.A very good book indeed. I'll be reading 'A Secret Love' after this. Hope it turns out to be good too!"
5,Loved It ! Couldn't put it down,"This book was well worth the wait. The characters were very well developed and the chemistry between them was great. There is also a mystery to be solved and although it was pretty obvious ""who did it"" I loved it just the same. I am really looking forward to Ameila's story."
3,Unrealistic but lots of fun for fans,"I was looking forward to the continuation of the Cynster series and also to the notion of a female Cynster. If you are a fan of this series, and I am, then you will enjoy this one even with its flaws. The biggest problem that I found is one several other reviewers remarked upon - the ability for a young woman of Amanda's class to venture safely through the less savory edges of society is highly unlikely if not practically impossible for the time period. There was just enough explanation/excuse offered to enable me to suspend judgement enough to enjoy the plot. However, the larger fault to me was the lack of character development and the dependence on the sex scenes to carry the day -Laurens can do better than that, and has!So although I enjoyed Amanda's story and will buy and read (an hopefully enjoy Amelia's) I'm fairly sure that I won't want to re-read it down the road!"
2,"Believe me, you've been here before.","I suppose that my biggest problem with this book is that the major characters never take the time to fall in love. Amanda meets Martin once and decides to pursue him. And the pursuit is so very predictable - rogue takes innocent to dens of iniquity. Then once Martin is ""caught"" the story is stretched out as Amanda tries to force him to admit that he loves her. Neither character receives more than surface development. This is book without Cynster fire and humor. Too bad."
5,STILL FRESH&WILDLY WONDERFUL!!,"So often I have found even among my favorites authors atendency to present a slightly weaker character with a bitof overusage of the same plots when writing series,sequels, etc.....NOT SO with Stephenie Laurensand the Cynsters. I have to admit that I have enjoyed the lastthree books in the series even more than some of the first.Amanda's story is fresh with a superb plot and wonderfulcharaters, both new and old. It was great to be reaquaintedwith Devil, Vane, etc. and meet Luc and Reggie. The nextfew days are going to seem forever waiting for Amelia's book."
5,Wonderful! Sexy! Hot! True Cynsterish!,"Stephanie Laurens has done it again. I think this book about Amanda Cynster and the Earl of Dexter is probably the best book in the whole series. I can't wait to read Amelia's story. Amanda is definitly a true Cynster, down to her tiny little feet and Martin, the Earl of Dexter is so very like the Bar Cynster that the melding of the two was riveting. If you have never read any of Ms. Laurens books, and I can't imagine there are many who have not, start with the first book and read all the way to On a Wild Night. Makes you wish there were Cynsterish men out there for real today."
2,a letdown....,"Let me just start this by saying that I LOOOOVE romance novels, and I love a good sex scene...but where was the emotion? I never thought Id say this, but this book had too much sex! It got boring after awhile, usually when Im reading a book and the tension is building, Im dying for some of the intimate scenes...but in this book, I actually found my self flipping ahead to read something besides all of this meaningless sex. Also, how in the heck did Amanda get away with such behavior back in the day? I think what got to me the most was..when I started this book..it began so well..I was immediately hooked into the fast pace..only to later be disappointed..all in all...not horrible, but it could stand to have about 150 pages knocked off."
2,I wish this was better...,"After reading the other Cynster novels, I had high hopes for Amelia's book. Even though she had seemed shallow in the other books, I figured she was young and would grow. I was disappointed.All of the Cynster novels are anarchronistic, then almost all regency historicals are. But this one WAS too anarchronistic for me. She runs around without a chaperone. She has sex in public places and she goes to a gaming hell. Hello!? In addition, she acts like a 15 year old high school freshman who desperately wants the senior quarterback who's not sure that she wants him. And to top it all off, she stamps her pretty foot like every chapter and announces that she won't marry him until he says he loves her.I'm so happy I got this from the library. Amelia Cynster needs a grow-up pill. If you want to read a really good Cynster novel, read Devil's Bride or A Secret Love."
1,"No plot, tedious","Whatever happened to being somewhat original & having an actual story with characters that you care about. It seems like S. Laurens wrote 20 pages of storyline & in the rest she copied the love scenes of her previous novels with some find & replace to change the surroundings around them. The book goes on & on about how he doesn't want to say I love you & how she needs him to say so & I don't know how Stepanie Laurens manages to write page after page saying the same premise. The love scenes are so boring, just way too wordy & without any build up to them so it is the same scene over & over again. Julia Quinn's novels have a lot more depth to them & an actual story line that she manages to make interesting even if she is using the old cliche cinderella story as she did in one of her novels."
5,Love those Cynsters,"Another wonderful Cynster novel! Amanda's story is every bit fun and sensual as her male cousins, although Devil's Bride is my all-time favorite romance novel. I thoroughly enjoyed keeping up with the lives of the others Cynsters as they were introduced. I can hardly wait for Amelia's story. Write on Ms Laurens!"
3,On A Wild Night,"I read all of the male Cynster books and they were hot and so were the Cynsters. However, I read this one about the first twin and it was boring to me and not as sexy. I read the reviews on the next book on the second twin and it was so bad I didn't buy it. So if we could go back to some more sexy Cynster men I would read all of them."
1,Boring..........,"I am generally a fan of Stephanie Laurens and the Cynster series but this book is so boring. It has almost no plot and no character development. It took me over a month to finish this book, usually I finish a book in a day or two, because I could always find something better to do."
1,Yawn...,"This book, my friends, can be best described as ""same old, same old."" I think the Cynsters should be retired and SL should get on with something fresh. Amanda and Martin were both rather annoying. Their actions and behavior were tedious and juvenile. Rather like the head cheerleader scheming to catch the football hero. Amanda is in her twenties, but acts like she's fourteen. If you're looking for a good SL book, try ""Devil's Bride."""
2,First book i read of Laurens...disappointing,After reading and seeing the amazon listmania of people's fav. books and noting that steph. laurens kept comin up...i decied to borrow one of her books to read...I have to admit well... amanda chasing dexter is rather interesting...plot is not bad.. but do they have to kiss and have sex every few pages?? every page i turned seems to have those scenes...after amandas rejection of dexter's proposal of marriage..its just dexter and her making out and then someone intrudes upon them...end...... Then this continues for like 2/3 time... i dont think the story is well developed
2,Not to the Standard of the Earlier Cynster Novels,"As always, Stephanie Laurens is an entertaining storyteller. However, this book deviates so far from the historical setting that it is more like time travel by a 21st Century young woman to the early 19th Century. Skipped over most of the middle to get to the end. Worth a read, but not a keeper."
2,Here we go again,"It seems to me that these writers need to read each other's work before producing another tale... I mean seriously this is the same story of A Marriage lesson by Victoria Alexander where the females wants excitement, forces the male to give it to her with the threat that she will go to someone else, falls in love, gets compromised and then goes on for more then 200 pages refusing to accept his marriage proposal because he has not said he loves her.... I mean SERIOUSLY? I bet I can find many other books the fill this exact outline. This story fails to give me something to enjoy, the only reason I kept reading was because I hate to start something and not finish it. Plus her earlier works were so great!All in all read the beginning then skip 200 pages right to the end..."
3,"Blah, Blah, Oooh, Blah, Blah","I felt that the author wrote the same ol' things over and over. She explained too many times how Amanda and Dexter felt, and why they couldn't do certain things. She seemed to be trying to fill up pages to make the book longer.But I gotta tell ya.......I adored the love scenes!"
3,SHOULD HAVE WAITED,"I must say that I enjoyed all of the Bar Cynsterseries, but this book could have used more depthand have the heroine not so focus on getting yourman, after a while that seem to be the whole story.I started reading the set of books about The Twins,Amanda and Amelia and 3 weeks later I am still read-ing these books. Should have waited until you couldhave put more of a story line in it."
5,what I was hoping for,"I loved this novel, though it helps that I've been able to track the twins personalities through the rest of the Cynster stories. I found the relationship captivating and endearing. I wasn't sure if the switch to a female Cynster would degrade the quality and this twin is certainly strong :-)"
2,bad subtitles,"the subtitles were totally done by an amateur-- they go by really fast and bleep and skip so you can't clearly read them. and i asked around, it's not just my dvd, other people have the same problem. i wish there was an English soundtrack!!!"
3,Refurbished Acer Ferrari 3400 overheating,"I received my refurbished ferrari, and after one day of trying to set it up to my liking, I sent it back to Acer for repair. Thank Goodness for the 90 day warranty, and will probably buy an extended warranty. The laptop would get very very hot (even though I could hear the fan running) and shut down after 5-10 minutes of use. This killed any processes that were running, and resulted in multiple ""blue screens of death"" regarding fat32 errors. It wouldn't stay running long enough to even re-build the system using the restore CDs.I also didn't have any luck connecting to my linksys 802.11b network. I could using a USB adaptor, but not with the internal wi-fi. Asked for acer to check that as well.It's been 4 days that acer has had it so far, and haven't had a response other than for a confirmation that they received it. Hopefully a repair will fix the problem."

4,Pretty nice,"N Werle's review seems a bit much... I'll give you the label separator thing, It really doesn't work at all. But the rest of your review... I can't agree with it. I received a Dymo (Letratag) & Brother (PT-70) label maker for Christmas and have so far really liked this model (Brother PT-70) far more than the Dymo Letratag. I haven't had any trouble using the features or accidentally printing. Construction seems a bit too ""plasticky"" for my taste while the Dymo seems more heavy and solid. The Dymo also uses 4 AA while the brother PT-70 uses 4 AAA. Not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing. Sure it will weigh less, but I assume the batteries won't last as long. Also, I really appreciate the qwerty keyboard on the Brother."
5,Love it!,"I really like this labeler! My main purpose for buying this was to make labels for my coupon binder, but i know I will find many other uses! Its very easy to use. There are different font styles and sizes, special characters, and borders. This is a great, inexpensive addition to any home or office."
1,doesn't work!,"I really needed one of these, but after reading and reading, I couldn't get it to work; how do I get a new one? How do I return this one?"
1,Piece Of Crap,"Unreliable, glitched constantly. Cheaply made. Badly designed, did not save settings, very unintuitive. Will never purchase anything by Brother again. Finally died a violent death."
1,"Oh, Brother--What a Battery Hog!","I have owned this labeler for a year or so now. The labels it creates look nice, though they are a bit small for most uses. HOWEVER, it is a battery hog, making it a pain to use, and not very good for the environment or the pocketbook. As an example, today I put in 4 fresh-from-the-box AAA batteries (that don't expire until 2013). I set up the functions, made 3 labels, then started getting the flashing battery message. That 10-minute process had drained all 4 batteries. So ridiculous. This is supposed to be a handheld labeler used for organizing projects. With such a short battery life, the labeler is more hindrance than help.I am very disappointed in the product."
2,"Works, but very annoying, as it does not remember settings.","The actual printing on this labeler is fine.I was looking forward to trying it out due to its QWERTY keyboard, which is an improvement over the ABC keypad I was using on another cheap Dymo labeler I've had.It has all the standard features - fonts, sizes, 2-line printing, etc - and I suppose you might call its date/time function a special feature.Unfortunately for whatever reason, it cannot save typeface formats. I like to print smaller type to save labeling tape, and this means that I must manually set the type size every time I use the labeler. This is an unacceptable flaw to me. Clearly it can store memory, as it uses batteries, and already saves the time and date (until you change the batteries, that is). So why would it lack something as simple as a memory for type size?It's braindead. Just like whoever designed the thing."
5,Workhorse Labeler,"I have recorded to DVD a collection of about 700 documentaries, on about 375 discs. I use the PT-70 to label each DVD jewel case with disc number on the case edge and title(s) on the front covers. In other words, I have gotten a lot of use out of this labeler. Between my documentary collection and other uses (files, etc.) I have probably gone through thirty rolls of label tape in the last three years. With all that use, the PT-70 has never failed me once. The tape has never jammed, there have never been any misprints, and every label I have printed looks as if I had printed them on a brand-new labelmaker. Once you get used to navigating it, the PT-70 is a breeze to operate. I HIGHLY recommend this impressive little labeler."
2,Battery Low Problem,"I've had this label maker for over a year and I was (pretty much) happy with it except now it has a problem ""Battery Low"" problem. New batteries work for only a little while and it stops printing labels when the battery voltage measures less than 1.4V for each battery (I tested each AAA battery with a meter). I'm not sure what is causing it and there doesn't seem to be a workaround for this problem, that I can find a solution for, on the Internet.So, I guess I got a year out of it which is good but now I'm in the market for a new labeler."
1,Died after about 10 labels,"You get what you pay for, I suppose. I have full batteries, and have only made about 10 labels. Now, when I try to print something, it makes a sound like it wants to do something, and then shuts down.Don't buy this unless you own stock in landfills - it's a POS."
2,Seems great..,"Product came quick, looked good and worked great at first. I began to organize and label everything, but as I got going every time I printed a label, the thing would shut off. I cannot figure out why! I have to adjust the batteries and turn it on again. Every single time I want to print a label! Besides that fault I would love everything about this label maker, but it was too late to return it once I got around to using it. My fault. So good label maker with many options so long as it works properly!"
4,Great Product,It is just what I wanted. Very Happy It works very well It is very well made and beautiful color
3,I have no other experiences to compare this to,"But this device does make easily legible labels, and once you get the hang of twisting them just enough to get the backing off to expose the adhesive, they're easy to use. But I found the deeper options more than a little fiddly to use, and I'm lucky my labelling needs don't require them - I usually set the thing set for all caps, and leave it at that. It prints slowly, and battery use is so-so, it seems to me - I've replaced them 3x already, and we don't use it that much. Label tape replacement was easy, though it seemed expensive. All in all, if I had to do it again, I'd probably look for a faster model, now that I've had the experience with this one."
2,Craig Finishes The Act!!,"This album's concept is really a great idea. Too bad it is not very well done. The young man has a nice voice; but for the most part everything is overdone. The arrangements are too busy. He strains for drama on almost every cut. Some of it works; most of it doesn't!His version of Climb Every Mountain is pure corn. There's Always One You Can't Forget is so forced and overly dramatic. Anything Goes is done as a torch song. If one is a torch singer he/she might be able to carry it off. The Impossible Dream is a dynamic song, but here it is cheesy in his interpretation. The rest of the tunes are merely OK. There is nothing really engrossing on the album. You're Nothing Without Me and the medley with Catherine Hickland, Andrea McArdle and Alice Ripley are the best cuts.Some of the overwrought renditions are tough to listen to more than once. If hetook everything down two or three notches, he might come up with a good album. The voice is sure there."
3,it won't finish his career,"good concept, poor execution. Only Anything Goes sounds right, his voice is not bad, but it does not have the power to bring the chills these songs deserve. It will gather dust on my shelf, while I listen to Linda Eder, Stacy Sullivan, Lisa Richard etc."
1,"NOT the same book reviewed below, Executive summary","This is the executive summary 64 pages. NOT the one reviewed below that is out of print. I checked it out of the library and found it very good, but wanted to finish it in detail on a long business trip. Was very disappointed when I saw a small flimsy pamphlet like book, not the good one. Amazon need to make this clearer to people. Watch the buy 3 get one free promos - there is a reason those books are sitting."
3,you can see yourself and others in this simple model of how people react and what they really want,Easy to read book that identifies 4 points on a compass of personal behavior . Task vs people focussed. Helps you understand what some of your colleagues may be thinking and why they react as they do.Also identifies strategies for dealing with people that may not be what you were thinking. MAy diffuse rather than exacerbate a problem at home or at work.
1,"Too little, too late",This thing never worked out of the box.........didn't try it right away so got stuck with it. It went to the trash!!!!! I could have had a great steak dinner for 2 for the cash that went to the trash.
5,Works great for my church and office use!!,I received this months ago and having using it like crazy. I Have been using this at home and also at my church for sunday school. I have been laminating big items and small items. It is pretty fast and for sure durable. The unit is very compact and portable so that allows me to use it in several places.It is very simple and easy to use. I took it out of the box and started using no instructions needed. This is not the cheapest out there but Fellows has a very good reputation for quality home and office products. I would suggest this to anyone no problem.
5,"Wonderful product, wonderful price!","I have been using this laminator for printed signs in a business and LOVE IT. I've only used it on its 3mm setting, but it works great with regular paper and card stock. If it's left on for a little too long, it starts to rattle a little, but otherwise it is absolutely silent. Not overly fast, but it gets the job done and done well. I would recommend this to anyone!"
5,Great Laminator!,"So far, so good! It has an alarm to let you know when it is ready. You don't need pouch jackets. I laminate a lot of 11x17 sheets and it does a great job!"
2,Not For Big Jobs,"It's a very nice looking product and easy to run out of the box. Unfortunately it doesn't stay hot enough for continuous action. I ran 12 laminates and by the 4th one, I had to run each item two or more times to seal completely and clocking in at a tortoise-like 1:02 per sheet, it's very, very slow. I finally figured out that if I needed it to stay continuously hot throughout my entire job, I had to run 3 mil laminates on 5 mil heat. Even then, I sometimes had to flip my sheet because the leading edge was still bubbling. I even tried another brand of laminating sheet to no avail. Also, clocking in at a tortoise-like 1:02 per sheet, it's very, very slow. The bottom line is that this product is meant for a casual user. It's not suited to a busy office."
4,Best Bang for your Buck!!,"I borrowed several different laminators before purchasing one for myself. This is BY FAR the easiest and most reliable machine in this price range. Cold laminators didn't achieve the effect I was seeking. Although one must be patient when using this machine it works consistantly. It rolls the paper through at its own speed reducing errors, but beware the lamination envelopes aren't cheap. Definately a worth while purchase if you have a lot of documents to protect!"
3,Hot? or Not?,This laminator does not get hot enough. The only way it seals is to run the item through WITHOUT a carrier.
4,Great for personal or light office use,"In the past I have always used single-use laminating sheets which work great but can be a real challenge at times. This was my first time using a heated laminator and I was throughly impressed at how easy it was to use. The instructions are simple and the end results are free of defects/air bubbles. The machine seems reasonably durable though I wouldn't consider purchasing this as an ""Office"" laminator. I don't think it's really intended for heavy duty use though I do plan to bring this into the office to share. I'll probably ask our administrator to keep an eye on it and only lend it out on an 'as needed' basis as I can't see this product lasting more then a few weeks on its own in an office setting."
5,great laminator!,This is a great laminator. It takes a few minutes to warm up but then you are ready to go. It makes a great sturdy seal and has been a great addition to our home.
3,Interesting Read,"I liked the book but wish author would of said more about subject and less about social period, over all very interesting."
5,Great for Dodger fans,Very interesting look at the history of the Dodgers from their Brooklyn days. Great pieces about Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese.
2,Made in China!,"This Flatware Set has a big lasered stamp on every piece that says ""China"" on it. I thought the company was a very old, reputable American company and I had chosen not to buy from other companies, when I saw reviews that their flatware was stamped ""Made in China"", but now this... I find it very unfair not to note such a thing in the description somewhere! The flatware is nice and heavy and looks good, the case it came in, came apart the first day as it can't hold the weight of the knives.Made in China on every piece was definitely a deal breaker for me at this price range!"
5,I love these things!,"I ordered two of these and one of them was slightly open and didn't have the adhesive strips with it, but the other one had extras so I could still use them both. These hooks look great and work pretty well. One of them fell off the wall but I might have had too much weight on it, so it was probably my fault."
5,WOW,"Too bad Amazon doesn't have tracks to listen to. This CD is one of the top ten ""guitar(&drums&bass)"" albums of all time. Dean Castronova rips on drums. Joey gets a great sound with this album. If you like Joe Satriani, Richie Kotzen, Eric Johnson, Paul Gilbert, You will love this. After buying, you will thank me for this recommendation!!"
3,Accounting Book,Not all of the information is updated that I thought could have been updated from the last edition.Easy to follow and gives good examples.
3,Missing part of it,"There was supposed to be a CD, and a work book with this product. I can totally understand why the work book was not there but there is no excuse for the CD."
5,Best Mandolin Strings,"These strings sound so bright and clear that I don't why I ever used another string. I can't afford a great mandolin but these strings make it sound much, much better than before. Also, I find that they last much longer than D'Addario strings in the same gauge."
5,Awesome product,"The NEC Multisync LCD monitor is an awesome product. I recently upgraded my desktop computer and decided to go with a flatscreen monitor. The NEC is an awesome choice. I previously had a NEC CRT monitor and all of my friends had to replace their monitors because the bulbs burned out over time (one was a Compaq, one was a Dell, and one was a Packard bell). My old NEC was still working fine when I sold it, after 8 years of service. The clarity on the new monitor is unreal. Great find."
4,eagle,I loved this product am still reading it but the purchase was new as described and the reading is what i expected. I have read other books of hers and this one does not disappoint
4,"A lovely text, and quite informative...","I was quite thrilled to find this, and I literally had no idea that such subject matter existed. I stumbled upon this book by chance, and I am now quite glad I did. I can rest much easier at night with the knowledge that our Lord and Savior prefers the 80's throwback of Acid-Washed jeans from Levi's. I'm so glad to hear that. I always knew that He would never go for that blasphemous Calvin Klein. Amen and enjoy."
2,Wilson Tennis Balls,Great service! Super fast delivery! Good price! Just what I was looking for. Thanks!
2,No Glitz Just Viper Information,"This book is just a rehash of many articles from car magazines. All the photos are in black and white, many pages appear to be very grainy photocopies. The quality of this book is poor. The only reason it gets my 2-stars is because of the topic not the presentation, not the photos and most certainly not the quality. Save you money for the high quality, hard cover Dodge Viper books out there."
3,"Spacey, Groovey and Clean","I really like this as an ALBUM,and also many of the individual tracks are danceable. Particularly good is Track 12 - ""Synthesizers"": very late nite-ish, mellow & spacey, groovy, clean!Not a get up and dance kind of thing really, but good trance/house music for background computer surfing after lighting up a fat one!"
4,Smart and Sexy,"This is great, classic-sounding electronic music. I don't know much about Moby, but I can tell you that this album is intelligent, funky, and it pulls off being ethereal without even remotely resembling trance.Moby throws together some House and Techno (but not only that), all overlaid by that beautiful electronic keyboard- very 80's, but I mean that in a good way. My favorite tracks so far are 3, 4, and 5... very hot! Some tracks are more techy than sexy, but nonetheless... this would be lethal on the dance floor. I will dance much to this CD. Yes."
3,"All modesty aside, apparently....","I dunno about ECs alarmingly-frequent celebrity turns; whether it's Burt or Soffie or even, now, Allen -- what's the point of all this? Just diggin' middle age, are we? NOTE: Van Morrison called -- he needs his overly-studied, Elder Statesman of LitRock persona back...."
4,Strong Depiction,"Nice video capture of the Elvis/Allen shows that highlighted the ""River In Reverse"" tour. I am a huge Costello fan, and the shows were good, not always as great as most other Elvis shows. Still, to see Allen and onstage together is fun and worth it if you were not able to experience the tour."
3,Back to the drawing board,"It's hard to criticize an Elvis performance on DVD, since they are so few and far between, but...The sound mix, as has been criticized elsewhere among the other reviews, leaves a lot to be desired. Imagine sitting in the theatre's restroom with the door open and listening to the concerts from there. VERY disappointing.And, though I enjoyed their associated album, the busy arrangements really don't translate well to DVD, and don't do the songs justice."
4,Good Help,"The notes are really helpful as a supplement to the book. I had to do a paper on it, and it gives a lot of insight on important topics to consider."
4,English literature in Middle Age.,An excellent book written and published first in the Middle Ages in England in Old English.
5,Gail's gift,"Cliff Notes was purchased for my husband to try and get through ""Canterbury Tales"". That about says it all. Great participation."
3,Worth browsing,"This is a reprint of an original 19th Century ""Emigrant's guide"" to Texas. The author, born in Scotland, makes pointed, and sometimes caustic remarks about the land, the people, wildlife, politics and other topics. Students of Texas History will spot a number of inaccuracies throughout the text. Names are mispelled and some Spanish words are spelled they way they would sound to an Anglo. The author entertains a low opinion of the Mexican people, but also derides the dullards and loafers among the ""Yanquiz"". (An equal opportunity offender perhaps?)The writer's sarcasm bubbles up often, which tends to become tiresome after several chapters. It is still worth browsing, but you'll need to compare it to other published works to get an accurate picture."
5,Great,As described. Great dvd for an incredible Patton/Kaada Project. My wife is gonna love me forever for this one. Thanks
3,It's Ok..kinda disappointed,"I was sooo excited to get this video...then I watched it. I am pretty much disappointed with it. First off, it's only about 32 minutes long. I would have thought a video on this subject would have been at least twice that long. I bought this video because I am an active shooter response instructor for the police department where I work and I was hoping to pick up few things. Well, we do some things similar to what's shown in the video and we do some things very different. However, this video was definitely dependent on working with the same person most, if all of the time. That is very unrealistic for most police departments. Before purchasing this video I read the reviews and this seemed to be a resource that I was looking for. Unfortunately, it's not. I can see where a novice in 2-person tactics may get something from this video, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars rather 2 or even 1 star."
3,The info is mostly right,"The information from the dvd is practical and very well explained. Although it seems a little bit outdated. The video is also vey cheaply produced, almost like a home video. Other than that, is a good way to get a sense of the methods used by israely trainers."
2,THIS CD IS ALRIGHT,"TRACK 1 AND 4 ARE THE TIGHTEST SONGS NO LIMIT HAS EVER PUT OUT TRACK 16 AND 5 ARE GOOD TO, THE CD STILL SUCK THOUGH."
1,WHAT HAPPEND ??,"Ok, so i am, or, was, a HUGE no limit fan. i have owned every album since 99 ways to die and everything in btween. right around the time this album came out is when i started to lose interest. What the hell are they thinking tryin to work a BON JOVI song into rap. this is a desperate attempt to sell another album that people bought because of the NO LIMIT. No limit has fallen off since long ago. and this album is a perfect example of WHY. what the hell happend to NO LIMIT? Very dissapointing over all. give me another MYSTIKAL album or a good TRU. even the tru cds now a days are retarted. take it back to your roots NO LIMIT."
4,This cd is worth getting from the cd store.,"This cd is tight, but it could have done better. They do have talent. But what makes this group good is that one of the people in the group is a singer while the rest of the group are rappers. Most of the cd is good, but like what I said, the cd could have been better. Peace ya'll"
5,Good Stuff!,"Great live sound. Comes off very raw. Not too polished-up taking away from the way they really sounded that evening, If you like Ander's, this is a taste of how it began as his sound is quite different nowadays."
4,A Timeless Guide,"""How to succeed in business"" books come and go. I have read (and forgotten) lots of them. Not this one. This one I will continue to refer to and recommend because of the practical wisdom and sensible techniques it contains. The thoughtful segments, including suggested action steps, illuminate solutions to the ordinary difficulties we all experience, not only in business relationships, but in all of our daily interactions with others."
1,Absolute Gibberish!,"I had to buy this 4th edition book for an environmental ethics class. I find the author's attempt to make the book long enough to be qualified as a text book down right PATHETIC. He adds way too many ""big"" words and unnecessary sentances. I'm sure he has some good points. But his endless babble will completely throw you off the trial, it's not worth the effort. It is a very difficult to read book, and even my professor admited that each chapter has to be read about 4 times to actually understand that point. Why my professor still uses this book is beyond me. By the way, this book is rediculously priced. I have to take this class for my environmental sustainability degree, but if that were't the case, you couldn't pay me $70 to read it. THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF TIME."
2,From Back Cover,"SHE NEEDED A BABY...and a sperm bank could be Liz Donovan's last chance. But instead of some anonymous donor, Quentin Whittaker was offering to father her child - as long as she married him first. The sexy CEO's whirlwind courtship was setting off enough sparks to start a whole family. At this rate, she'd be pregnant before she walked down the aisle!HE NEEDED AN HEIRMaking love to Elizabeth was the most exquisite pleasure Quentin had ever known, but forever wasn't part of his game plan. Yet once she had his baby, how could he walk away? Heaven help him, he wanted her - in lust, in wedlock and in fatherhood. But was love part of the bargain?"
4,Good Text Book,"I am a middle-school student that uses ""Write Source 2000."" It is a great book. My only complaint is that it doesn't have page numbes which makes it hard to find things. Over all, this is a good book."
5,breat resource,great resouce and referewnce book for kids writing book reports. would highly reccomend for and student doing a paper. helps you document any source among lots of other benefits.
5,The Spirit Returns,"This is the second volume of Spirit stories, by master graphic storyteller Will Eisner. This is great stuff, and Eisner hadn't even reached his peak yet when these stories were produced. If you're a comics fan, you should buy all the Spirit Archives."
2,...,"I am very dissapointed with volume 2 of ""The Spirit Archives."" The stories were dull and the art was average. Hopefully with the next couple of archives I will start seeing the material that was reprinted by Kitchen Sink Press in the Eighties. The only value this book has is the historical interest of seeing these stories as they appeared sixty years ago. I'm sorry Mr. Eisner, as much as I respect you for being the comic book legend that you are I am just not moved by what I've seen in the first two volumes."
5,Nice reference for buyers and sellers,"This is an excellent walkthrough of the basic features, along with some pro tips, for both the buying and selling aspects of eBay. There is more on the selling aspects, but that's only natural since there is more to do there. The writing is good. The screen shots demonstrate the points but aren't overused. And the author genuinely seems to know what she is talking about."
4,Error in Description:,"""Ladies Sigma Light Cotton LowRise Knee Patch Riding Breech"" is a comfortable pant for AZ. Unfortunately, when you hit the purchase button, often you get a pant that has the word ""ribbed"" in it. That is the one which is polyester and hot. Perhaps the sellers or Amazon will fix this error."
3,"LOVE Thom, Don't Love This DVD","Thom's designs are always amazing. He never fails to impress. This DVD, however, is a mess. The organization of it makes it so you can't follow a single design from planning to execution... you have to see ALL of the projects at once! You see all of his impressions of the spaces, then see all the shopping trips, then see all the final reveals... you can't keep all the people and designs straight! And all of this chaos is accompanied by the nonstop Queer Eye techno. For an hour. Oof. I LOVE THOM!!! I just do NOT love this DVD!"
4,i think cd is a pretty good no limit cd,"The songs with master p in them are tight. Numbers 5,6,13,and 16 are pretty good. The other songs are alright."
5,Amongst the Label's elite,"Steady Mobb'n's ""Black Mafia"" was VERY different from the cd's that No Limit put out in '98. (No Limit had 22 releases alone in 1998) What makes it so different could be one of many reasons, #1- They are from Oakland, CA....not New Orleans. #2- They can rhyme over any beat. or is it #3- They are just better emcees than anyone in the No Limit camp?! Either or, this cd was monumental to thier career. The highlight include ""No One"", ""Crosses Artist"", ""MG Theme"" and others."
1,useless: basic and often ugly icons (diskette),"I haven't got the book, but just the diskette, which really disappointed me as these ""starter icons"" are absolutely basic and often ugly.I found it useless for anyone who already works with icons, Wingdrings are better."
5,Powerful Communication Skills Taught from a Top Expert!,"That's Not What I Meant explores how to improve communication for both men and women in their personal and private lives. Topics covered include how and why people communicate differently, why misunderstanding occur and how to improve ones own communication style.Deborah Tannen is an accomplished linguist who has invested many years learning how men and women communicate, and how that communication can be improved. Her ideas are well researched, easy to understand and apply.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"
5,Relevant to all human beings.,"Everyone communicates and knows what it is like when it doesn't always go smoothly. This is a great linguistic book on understanding communication styles and it sheds light on what other people may actually be trying to say--even if it doesn't come out the way it is perceived. I especially like the discussion on male-female communication styles. It is a real eye-opener and a great help to understanding people better, period."
5,That Guy Didnt even read it.,"The ""Then why did you say it"" man who gave the book one star utterly missed the point of the book. He should read it again, this time with the lights ON."
2,A blueberry muffin with all the blueberrys and no muffin,"The basic information in this book is invaluable, but the Author's style resembles that of high school student. The book is written in a classic outline style (I'm going to talk about this now), it's impersonal and has cold examples. Dr. Tannen doesn't seem to give much if any of her own realizations, instead she consistantly refers to other experts. I constantly felt as though I was reading a report written for a social psychology class."
1,Tannen proving her point my missing the point,"Tannen believes that men comunicate only in a report fassion. 'Only the facts, mame.' Women normally converse in a raport fassion, talking to build relationships. Tannen (a woman) doesn't understand that men build raport by talking the facts. How to overhaul an engine, sports stats, politics, etc. The condenced book form of this book would be a best seller and would go like this, ""Men and women misunderstand each other all the time. It is worth the work and time to admit this and ask for clarification."""
1,Then why did you say it?,"Too often today vested interests present inane theses encouraging support of the subjects that provide their sustenance. The thesis of this book, that individuals should take advantage of metamessage concepts, results in deception. That there is an effect created by tone of voice, language style, speed of speech, etc. etc. cannot be denied. Those interested in communication, however, attempt to eliminate these effects, not take advantage of them. Tannen's information might be put to use to eliminate the dissimulation commonly encountered today, but the more obvious use is to encourage non-verbal misdirection. The most obvious example is our president. I have never seen such sincerity supporting a provable lie. Would that this area of expertise sink without a trace."
4,How to listen,"This is my favorite of Tannen's books. It makes some simple but important points about why people have trouble communicating. They talk differently.My favorite comment was about people having different tolerances for pauses after the other person stops talking. For some people it is 10 seconds. For others it was nano-seconds. I wanted to encourage a quiet friend to talk. I found that by counting silently to ten after I finished talking before starting again, made him realize there was a gap to be filled there. An easy trick but I learned a lot from him and Tannen.This is the book to give to friends and relatives, rather than her others that beat the differences between men and women into the ground. Simple but with a sweet and useful message."
1,Not reliable,We tried this a couple of times and bought it based on customer review but it didn't work right at all. We are smart people but it just didn't work right. I wouldn't waste the money on buying this product. In the long run we bought the game we were trying to fix. I wish I could have put the money I spent on this towards it.Maybe it was just our product that didn't work properly as I know others reviewed this product well.
5,"""A Naked Look at Social Convention""","A stirring look at the primal factors driving man in the art of Love, the doldrums of Work and the visceral depths of War and chronicling our relative similarity to our closest cousins, the primates, Desmond Morris adds soil and soul to the grassroots movement sparked in the Sixties counterculture to reconnect with some bygone artifact of Man's blind past. There can be no doubt that the embattled Sixties and the embittered youthful revolts influenced Morris to direct his scientific acumen at the internal drive of Man.Overall, this is a good start for those questioning just how biological many of Man's drives are."
4,"Some material outdated, yet a unique approach to humans.","I found the book fascinating because it forces you to look at human beings for what they really are. It gives you an objective approach to human behavior. Some of the material is outdated, but the format and approach of the book is refreshing."
2,Tainted by sexism,"I read this when it came out, I was 10 years-old. I've since become a cognitive psychologist and am therefore in a position to appraise the book as an insider.At one point, Morris claims that if you hand little girls a doll, they will ""instinctively"" cradle it so that the doll's head lies on the left, close to the heart. He claims this is evidence of the mothering instinct. So, I took a doll to school and experimented on my friends. I experimented on about 35 kids, boys and girls. I found that Morris was wrong. Little girls did not differ from boys as to the way they first held the doll.So, if you read this book, watch out. It contains many DUBIOUS claims which would lead one to believe that differences in behavior between men and women are ""natural"" or ""instinctive""."
4,Evolution or revolution,"This book is great to read. Whether you believe what's been written or not, not-so-religious people can't deny evolution. It's as simple as 1+1=2 and that's how this book has been written.You believe what I just said? Grab a copy of the book now!Don't believe me? Good, as I don't buy into everything that has been said as well. But I do think it's important that the more views you have, the better your fundamentent for judgement is. This book certainly has some very strong points and may sound familiar to you.So, just with psychology and Dr. Phil, don't believe everything that's being said, but make up your own mind. Maybe this book will be 'a changing day in your life...'."
5,Something for everyone,"There isn't much more to say other than this is an amazing book, but I'll try. It includes comparisons of human and non-human animals in the realms of sex, child-rearing, fighting, hunting, and day-to-day living. Not one of the 250 or so pages was uninteresting. It's a very quick read and you'll find yourself reading it again and again. This book is a must for any biology major or anyone interesting in learning about our origins. I would definitely suggest checking it out."
3,Outdated,"This book uses false logic to reach his conclusions. He more finds how he wants human nature and evolutionary psychology to be. He relies greatly on the works of Freud, and doesn't have very much data in his book. He is however a great writer, and this book is a classic, but read other texts in psychology and anthropology that are more dated, and take what he says with a grain of salt."
2,An outdated analysis,"If you are interested in a 1950-60's view of human evolutionary science, this book may be worthwhile. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Evolutionary science has advanced dramatically in the last 50 years and has discredited many of the views presented in The Naked Ape. Several are even laughable, such as the explanation of homosexuality in the chapter on sex.Further, while promoted as a zoological study, the presentation is psychological, focusing on behavioral issues and their explanations rather than biological evolution. It is filled with the ""he-man hunter"" psychobabel that was preached in 1960's university Psych courses.Simply, this book was a waste of my time and money. The reviews that stated the book was dated, but still relevant, were sadly mistaken."
3,"Revolutionary in 1967, Not So Much Today","The Naked Ape was certainly an important book for its time, as it helped people think about themselves and their fellow humans in a different light. However, reading the book about 45 years after it was first published, its age begins to show, with some old-fashioned chauvinist ideas creeping in, an incredibly biased point of view towards the European/American model of society as the only one that matters; and a surprising amount of false and outdated psychological ideas ascribed to people (surprising given that the premise of the book is that we are far closer to our animal nature than we care to admit).I would still recommend reading The Naked Ape just because it is an important milestone in the history of cultural anthropology/evolution, but would take a lot of the conclusions with a healthy dose of skepticism. A much better book on the same subject is Robert Wright's ""The Moral Animal Why We Are the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology""."
5,"Fantastic! Stimulating, thought-provoking and entertaining!","I consider Desmond Morris to be the Carl Sagan of Ethology: The Naked Ape is highly concentrated brilliance... yet is easy to read and understand! In The Naked Ape, Dr. Morris gently peels back our species' self-importance and examines us as pure animal. He remains objective and concise at all times. It's hugely impacted my outlook on the human race, and I think it should be handed out free to students by the world's governments. Every chapter in this book gets 100% from me. If you enjoyed it, I reccomend The Human Zoo. But all of his books are to the same standard: the man is a genious!"

2,Disappointed with this album/cd,"I know he's good, but you really wouldn't know it listening to this album. For me, it was pretty much a complete waste of listening time and effort, mainly because I expected a LOT more than this depressing effort. The ""music"" depresses me too...What was he thinking on this?Peter"

2,Must Have Received Seconds Instead of First Quality,"This is another color in the curtains I recently ordered, and while the color is nice and what I expected, I didn't expect 2 of the panels to have multiple holes in them about the size of a dime! I ordered 4 panels of this color and 4 panels of another color (Moroccan Red), and the red ones are perfect, while these panels in the Camel color had holes that were difficult to hide when they were hung."
4,Another Sublime Release from Monolake,"As there are so many techno dub artists nowadays who follow the path of Chain Reaction's pioneers, Monolake takes it's music to a different and absolutely personal style. This CD is not as dense or dark as Gravity, but mantains the cool and nocturnal feeling. Again with loads of fresh and innovative rythms, with percussion that surrounds you coming from everywhere. Some more processed voice samples than in Gravity, more like the Hong Kong days. I am aware that Gerhard Behles has not participated at all in this production, so this music is representing Rob Henke's ideas only. Some tracks are a litlle faster and groovy than the average Monolake. Although Cinemascope is not as profound as Gravity, it surely displays technical and compositional improvements that show that Monolake's evolution line is still going upwards. Nothing sounds like Monolake, and if there is something that does, please tell me."
5,Lounge the way it should be ...,"A fabulous album ... tres Fantastique ...This album is wonderful ... Its lounge at its best ... Personal best is ""Love labours Lost"" Perfect for any occasion. I can listen to it day and night ... Great for parties and to wind down with your loved one, friends or just on your own. Cut the bread, serve the wine, get comfortable and unwind. the music makes you want to fly, makes you want to live, to be alive, to jump and dance ...This is Lounge the way it should be. Even better than the Naked music collection (bare essentials, nude tempo. try it and you'll be hooked!"
5,An excellent example of the legendary Space-pop orchestra,"S.P.O.C.K's clearly best produced album. Assignment Earth is clearer, poppier, more analogue and perhaps even more 80's style than SPOCK's earlier long play Alien Worlds. Assignment Earth is guaranteed hit songs with unforgettable lyrics and melodies. This record brings SPOCK from the undergroup synth-scene into the world of top charts. SPOCK has earned their success after their long 10 year mission on Earth. Live Long and Prosper!"
3,not as good as the others,"I've read the other books in the ""Book of Psalms"" series and this one was very disappointing. The story began in a fairly amusing and intriguing way, as is usual with Kate Charles, but about half way through, the characters and dialogue became very predictable and the ending was not a surprise, to say the least. The dialogue also seemed very dated and similar to the author's other stories. I hope the next one will be better."
3,A well-plotted mystery.,"This book held my interest all the way through and was well-written. One thing puzzles me. Part of the plot hinges on a young bride who receives obscene phone calls. She gets so upset that it is ruining her marriage and her health. She listens to each phone call all the way through each revolting detail. Why? Why doesn't she simply hang up the phone? Or report the problem to the telephone company? Somehow, since the gal is not an idiot, this part does not ring true. I wonder if this bothered any other readers."
4,Gaggia Syncrony Compact Digital,"100% (super) automatic at the best price, in a form factor that would fit on my counter, were my requirements. The Gaggia Syncrony Compact Digital was the clear winner. Biggest complaints: Vendor intentionally removes a non-essential item from the package before shipping but does not inform customer of this action; and the Operation Manual is poorly written. Great coffee maker."
1,"Good Coffee, not Espresso","I bought this machine to make espresso drinks at home, but instead, I have a very expensive coffee machine that does not make good espresso. The convenience of the machine is wonderful, easy to clean, easy to fill, etc., but since I wanted espresso, I was disappointed. The espresso that it puts out is weak and does not have that espresso bite, but tastes pretty good with hot water added to it to make an Americano. If you want this type of conveinience, this is a good machine, but if you want true espresso, you will have to go with a semi auto and good grinder. Wish I Had!"
3,Average in content and illustrations,I am always disappointed in the Bob the Builder books. I never find them to be of the same quality as the videos. The illustrations aren't very interesting. This book is about Bob's birthday and I think it would be more exciting for my boys if there were more truck action in it. This book is in Spansih. It is entirely soft cover so not very durable. Ours was destroyed in less than a month.
4,Easy read.,"This book is a quick summary of the eaerlier book Prozac or Potatoes, which has more details.Enjoyable even though full of repetitions."
2,"Same old thing, different book","Well, while I enjoyed the biochemical explanations for sugar addiction, the 'diet' itself is like so many out there now. Basically, stay away from sugars and white foods (except for that potato).. It also seems to embody some of the glycemic index theories.. All in all, I wasn't impressed.. It's helped so many people though, it might be worth a shot for someone else.. GOOD LUCK!"
2,DesMaisons sold out,"When I read Potatoes Not Prozac, I thought, ""at last, a book on diet that doesn't focus on losing weight!"" After all, food acts in the body in a much more complex way than simply making you lose or gain weight. Apparently DesMaisons decided to pick up on the weight-loss market and rewrite PnP for losing weight. I felt her style of explaining how I feel now and how I'm going to feel after doing her plan, little more than the common weight-loss testamonials you see in every second-rate diet advertisement. By the way, I have eliminated sugar from my diet and it has not ""changed my life"" or solved all my problems. The 4 billion dollar diet industry, which DesMaisons has become a part of with this book, banks on those types of claims."
2,Be careful,"Initially, I found this book to be a good read. Eliminating sugar and increasing protein seemed to make sense. However, too much protein can cause a host of problems. I have had to start supplementing with HCI hydrochloric acid, because my body could not metabolize all the protein I was eating. I also developed Rosacea because of not having adequate HCI to handle overload of protein. I am now supplementing with amino acids, and only need a normal 55 grams of protein, a day. My mood,and weight are fine. I also get restful sleep like never before. A book that outlines amino acid supplementation is The Mood Cure, or The Diet Cure, by Julia Ross."
5,T-Bone Burnett meets Bob Dylan...,"First heard this played late at night on a Windsor, Ontario radio station, and was spellbound at the great melodies, wonderful arrangements and sneakily skillful production. Would recommend to anyone who appreciates unpretentious yet intelligent rock music. Very diverse set, unified by very sharp pop sensibility and pointed, compassionate lyrics. Thought initially I was hearing T-Bone Burnett's latest with Daniel Lanois producing. I can't wait to dig back into Paul Kelly's earlier catalog. Really quite a lot of talent. A very rewarding set that shows ""grown-ups"" (check the guy's hairline on the cover art) can rock with the best of 'em."
5,Irreplaceable!,"Most of the songs are worth a chuckle (Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer being one of the more entertaining!) but the hands-down absolutely irreplaceable can't-live-without song is the Jingle Bells (Laughing All the Way) track. I dare anyone to listen to that and not laugh at least once!!! It makes you smile ... it makes you feel good ... it is definitely a classic. It's brimming over with the fun, goofy, silly side of Christmas. (The real meaning of Christmas is something else entirely.) This is just the light-hearted stuff that makes the Christmas season extra-happy. A must-have, to be sure!!!"
5,My Favorite Christmas Music,"When I was growing up, we had this CD. We would listen to it while we decorated the inside of the house for Christmas (along with a few others) and now I get to share this with my family. I love this time of year and am so happy with my purchase. :)"
4,I love this CD!,I used to listen to this tape as a kid when i was decorating the Christmas tree with my mom.So to get it as an adult in CD form is awesome!I received it promptly and seller was very helpful.
3,UML starting point,"Recomemnded as- The only read, for people wanting to have an understanding of what UML really is. For example, managers who need to grasp the benefit of UML and assess the difficulty of it's use.- The first read, for people wanting to actually use and implement UML."
3,It's OK so far,"I bought this book with a great deal of anticipation. I'm doing a lot more analysis than development these days, and I thought UML would be a good thing to know. I just finished the second chapter of this book, and I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed. I found two significant errors in the second chapter. Figure 2-12 is incorrect. It's exactely the same as figure 2-11, and does not match the description in the narrative. Also, in the quiz at the end of the first chapter, the first question says ""What symbol represents a use case"", and the answer they give is ""A stick figure"". The correct answer is an oval with text. A stick figure represents an actor. If these mistakes are in the first chapter, what sort of mistakes will there be later if/when things get more complex?"
3,OK UML book,"UML is not exactly an easy subject to understand and I don't think this book can ""demystify"" UML for any beginner.My biggest complain about this book is that it could be less verbose and more clear.But it's definitely worth reading."
2,Buy only if you have no idea how casino marketing works,"This book is a great introduction into casino marketing and how they get you into thier casino to gamble. There is no miracle in this book to get a ton of free stuff.This book and her ""new"" book are the same book just her old book she doesn't try to sell you all her other products. There is no reason to buy this book unless you don't know how to sign up for a slot club or ask a pit boss/slot host for free things."
4,How to get the most for your gambling dollar,"This book is a very good introduction to the world of casino perks. If you don't understand slots club, complimentaries, etc. this book will help you nagivate through the confusing world of casino marketing and slot clubs.If you're going to gamble, gamble smartly and get the bounty that casinos are willing to offer to you.If you are a seasoned gambler and comp wizard, this book may be a little elementary for you. However, even the most experienced gambler will get several times the cover price in information.Highly recommeneded for anyone who thinks they are not getting all they are entitled to from the casinos."
1,Horrible.,Horrible book regarding Casino comps. Very outdated and all she says is the comps she's getting without really any insight for the average person.
1,nonsense,pure and simple. DO go ahead and hang around crowded airports waiting to get bumped. Put your head deep into digusting garbage cans to retreave some coupons. Is this fun? The book is filled with nonsense.
5,A great primer for the novice gambler,"Jean Scott has given some terrific advice in this book. Even people who think they are experts can learn a thing or two, but it is the novice that will truly gain from this book. To them, it will be worth many, many times the purchase price."
3,"A $3,000 bankroll isn't a ""low roller"" to me","While this book is an enjoyable read, and there is a lot of good advice given to casual players, I don't consider Jean Scott to be a ""low roller."" As she says, you need a bankroll of $3,000 to make her system work on 25 cent video poker. To me, that's hardly a ""low roller."" Also, there is no way when I'm on vacation that I'm going to spend 8 hours a day playing a machine. That seems more like work to me- I'd rather have a drink by the pool, or just wander the Strip. And taking food from the buffet in a doggie bag? Please!All that being said, I'd still recommend this book. It will give you enough tips that what whatever gambling you do, you'll benefit. It's an easy read, and it'e also entertaining. Just don't think that by reading it you'll be getting suites comped to you. A free room or buffet now and then is about it."
2,Not an essential book to read on gambling,"For players looking to learn about the games or to maximize comps, this is NOT the book to read. Essentially Scott's advice is to play and then ask for comps or get cashback from your machines, which is what everyone does. Her ""refinements"" are outlandish, especially hanging out in airports to get bumped and digging in garbage cans to get coupons. If you are looking for THE book on casino gambling and comps I recommend Frank Scoblete's ""Guerrilla Gambling. It is loaded with valuable information. Jerry Patterson's new edition of ""Casino Games"" is also a very worthwhile book."
3,The Frugal Gambler,I really didn't think it gave me much information on deals in Vegas which I thought it would.
5,for collectors,"a very informative book for all collectors of uniforms, caps, helmets, and so on. with the history and insignia of all waffen-ss divisions. lots of pictures, tables and information"
4,I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars,"I purchased Perfect Lies first at an airport, put it in my bag and then set it aside as a backup book. When I got home, I read the review on Amazon and thought, oh no why waste my time? Since it was 11pm and I was desperate, I started to read it anyway and guess what? I liked it. My only complaint, (and here I agree with the reader from Arizona) is that the romance between Meg the protagonist and Abe, her lawyer/friend was a little late and not very inspiring or believable. All in all, I think Perfect Lies was perfectly okay."
2,Not What I had Expected,"I found this book hard to get through because the story just wasn't there for me. The romance doesn't even begin until well over halfway through the book, and by then you don't even care. I found myself being bored and just wanting to read the last chapter to find out who did it, that way I could just put the book away and go on to a more satisfying read. This book should try to bring the reader into it, and instead drives the reader out of it. I think Liza Bennett is a talented writer, but she just needs to get a story we can sink our teeth into."
1,not original; laden with typographical errors,"Pretty much the title of this review says it all. Mediocre writing and a very stale plot made it a chore to read. Also, if I had to estimate, the book contains AT LEAST 25-30 typographical errors which annoyed me endlessly. Really people - who is proofreading the copy? I recommend this book to anyone who can not find anything else to read."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,Chopper Ops was an easy read and fast paced...but it could have been better. It seems more along the lines of Wingman which I like...up until the the other world stuff. Although Chopper Ops takes place in the near future...it seems almost science fictionish...especially with the Angel and the Ghosts. Hope the next one gets better.
3,Easy reading,"A little cartoonish, but I wasn't expecting Tom Clancy quality so I wasn't disappointed. I actually plan on buying the next in the series when it's published :)"
3,confused and uncertain,"Simply put, this work does not present Heschel at his best. He has no real insights as a secular historian, and his observations about Jewish history, the Jewish state and Zionism, are one sided and unfair. But Heschel being Heschel, the work does have much to offer. When he sticks to some of his topics which are well worn, like notions of Jewish time and space, the work shines with the special sanctity of his mind and his sparkling insights. But even this is not enough to save this work. It is both vague and pointedly polemical; its clumsily drawn conclusion don't have enough punch."
5,ancient traditions,"This CD presents the ancient musical traditions of the Ethiopian tribes that have never entered the main stream of the Ethiopian music scene. The songs of the Afar, the Anuak, the Oromo and other. There is only one (amazing !) song by an Amhara and none by a Tigry. The diversity of sounds within one country is unusual. For me this is a library of rhythms and sounds that is thrilling and enlightening. This music is primal - earthly and unsophisticated. This must be how we all sounded 2,000 years ago. I must single out Mary Armeede's long and beautiful song, Fano. Her voice and Krar playing is full of emotion and musicianship in a way rarely heard these days. These recordings from 1971 are a must for every fan of original tribal music and/or Ethiopian music."
3,The real deal,"I don't doubt the authenticity of these selections, but having just returned from a month in all of Ethiopia (as a tourist), I am afraid I wasn't exposed to much in the way of ""real"" Ethopian tribal music; therefore, I found the results (I purchased the album to accompany my DVD showing of photos)to be more vocal than instrumental selections - which for my purposes - would have been preferred."
2,No improvement whatsoever,"I'm not sure what the other guy seems to think he got actual horsepower or even better mpg. Well I didn't, my application was a 2006 Toyota Tacoma double cab, 4.0 V6.I waited to do this review when i calculated my gas mileage, improved by nothing actually. I still get 330 miles to a tank, which equals to about 18.0 mpg mixed citydriving. I will also tell you that I noticed absolutely no horsepower gain. So you might ask what's the point of this intake? I couldn't really tell you actually?The fit and quality of the material is excellent, as it's American built. But if your looking for extra mileage, or horsepower the only way your going to achieve thatwith this kit is if you imagine it."
3,Very little hard information - And the price guidelines are worthless,"Someone needs to write a serious book on this subject. This book is basically a stroll through the patterns the author owns and a few tidbits and factoids. Half the pattern numbers don't have dates given. Values are pulled from thin air. 90% of patterns covered in this book are between 1940 and 1960. So it is not really a century of anything, but about 20 years of one person's collection. Still, I find myself using it as a reference, so I give it 3 stars."
4,Not a bad book to start with,There are a lot of good things about this book. It also has some flaws. For example the presentation and organization of the book could have been better. All of the same I consider it a good introduction. Chadwick and Cunliffe are two of the greatest living authors of Celtic history today and this book it certainly is head and shoulders above many of the books on the Celts out today that are full of misinformation and tall tales.Recommended to the beginner.
2,Every Inch of Her,"Light read, not very believable nor well-written. Should go back to reading Maeve Binchy.....the ultimate writer of Irish women."
3,A bit of a disapointment,"This is the first Agatha Christe novel I have read and also the first mystery I have read since reading the Nancy Drew books as a little girl. Frankly, I was disappointed.Miss Marple is not the protagonist of this novel--although she is the one who solves the murder. The story is told in first person by the Vicar.The feminine comes through only partially. There are a lot of stupid generalizations about women made by charecters in the book. ""women cause a lot of trouble"" ""i thought it one of those silly remarks women will make"" ""she is a woman and women will act in that silly way"" etc. Mostly these are made by charecters that are obvious dolts, but sometimes comments are made by women about other women and the protaganist, who is meant to be likable says of a women ""she is such a prize idiot"".I had hoped that Christie's work would be more sympathetic to women."
1,Annoying,"I don't understand what is wrong with the writer of this book but maybe she just wrote this ""for money."" The conversations, characters, setting, and plot are dumber than nursing home dances. The end. And I have nothing against old people! I think this book is destructive to the reader psychologically, so only use it as a gift to someone who needs to learn to recognize the signs of moronic behavior. This would be great!"
4,The first Miss Marple (I believe),"Despite being around 70 years old, this is still a charming mystery. Indeed, it's a testament to Dame Agatha that she devised such a complex plot at such an early stage in her writing career.The plot is classic British small town mystery. An unpopular man is dead and there are a host of people with motives - but none with an obvious opportunity. Miss Marple chases some red herrings but eventually sees that which isn't quite right.I listened to the abridged BBC version with mixed feelings. Three hours is probably a reasonable amount of time for this plot so I don't regret the abridgement. However, this is a presented as a radio drama (not a reading of the text) and it's a bit confusing to follow all of the characters. I'd recommend that other readers listen to this in one sitting, preferably with few distractions."
4,Classic Christie!,"This is the first of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mysteries. While the story is good, it's also a little rough around the edges, and lacks the deft handling visible in later stories. Of course, that's perfectly understandable, even Miss Marple did not emerge fully-formed from her creator's head (she's no Athena!). The recurring characters from the later Miss Marple mysteries have not yet been introduced (or if they are introduced in this book, they're not fully fleshed-out).The story is interesting, and well-done. There are a lot of clues scattered about and the reader will feel that they're one step ahead of the vicar in identifying them (which I like, I'm bad at picking out clues!). There are several possible murderers and plenty of red herrings; the ending comes as a bit of a surprise.If you like Christie's mysteries, you will probably enjoy reading about Miss Marple's debut as a detective.Note on Kindle formatting: Very good. I did not notice any issues whatsoever."
3,Noisy Neighbor Solves a Murder,"This made Miss Marple appear as a noisy neighbor and an old ""pussy"" as she is called. Since the murder was at the beginning of the book you had no attachment to the victim. It appeared that without Miss Marple this would have been an unsolved crime."
4,Kept Me Guessing,"I love any Agatha Christie book. This one kept me guessing who had murdered that man most people disliked. But for the murder to take place in the vicarage, now that makes for lots more questions. Miss Marple of course has questions that lead the reader one way and then another. It's not till the end that the truth is exposed. Lots of well written characters and Miss Marple words of wisdom along the way."
4,Murder at the Vicarage,The Murder at the Vicarage was a very slow book and you have to have logic to figure it out but once you get past the slow part it progresses very fast. Miss Marple does it again in solving another murder. She does not miss a thing and is very sharp. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages.
4,The forgotten Marple,"The Sherlock Holmes everyone knows is not quite the same Sherlock Holmes that appears in the very first story; ditto Father Brown; and ditto Miss Marple. In the latter two cases the original character is more intriguing than what follows.In later books Miss Marple solves crimes in part because she is wise. In this book she isn't wise. She's just a shameful snoop, who trains her binoculars on everyone who steps outdoors in St. Mary Mead, and has been doing so for half a century. In many ways she leads an empty existence. But she's much more endearing here than the Miss Marple of later books, who is so very wise.The usual Christie twist is good, too. It's one of those primeval detective plot devices that Chesterton and Christie between them appear to have exhaustively copyrighted."
5,ANOTHER SUPERB JOB OF DAME AGATHA,"Ms.Marple did it again!. This time, our favourite detective had to deal with a murder in her own village, St.Mary Mead. The victim, Colonel Protheroe, was not a very nice person, so his death almost acceptable to everyone in the village. There's a widow, a daughter, and a mysterious lady from his past, plus a number of people who had a very strong motive to do the murder. But once again Ms.Marple discovered the real murderer with her own old-way. The basic idea of this story is not very special, but the plot is. We'll get some laughs as usual and a satisfaction in the end. Two thumbs up for Agatha Christie!!"
3,"Old-Fashioned, But Still Keeps You Guessing","I do love a good mystery, but I'm afraid I'm just not the target audience for Ms. Christie's crime novels.When I read a mystery, I need it a little grittier. I like hardened detectives or brilliant young hackers, and I like modern stories. I would never argue that Agatha Christie is not a prolific, talented writer, because duh, look at her legacy! But Miss Marple is just too stuffy for me and the writing is too dated, and not in a romantic way. The book is good, just not my cup of tea. I was just bored with it and I wasn't a fan of the language, and by the end, I didn't really care who murdered Colonel Protheroe. The last chapter was sweet and I did smile at some of the subtle jokes, but all in all, I don't think I'd read another Miss Marple book. She's just not a heroine that interests me.I enjoyed Christie's ""And Then There Were None,"" though, so I'm not ruling her out of my library completely"
1,The Fab Five Collection,"This was a REAL disappointment. The initial Amazon review gave the impression that I was buying the show since I live overseas and only see recordings from time to time. I was looking forward to seeing all the shows back to back. These DVDs were clips and outtakes from the shows and if I had opened this before leaving the US I would have returned it. For me, it was a big waste of money and the producers of the show should know it. I'll avoid any offering that comes out in the future based on what they turned out this time."
2,mixed reviews,"I bought this as a gift. I was almost embarrassed to give it, however.It must be a faithful reprint of the original because the print quality is most definitely lacking. Many of the images are so dark & muddy that you can't tell anything about what they should look like. If I weren't giving it to someone who truly loves this artist, I'd have returned it.Thankfully, he actually seemed interested in reading the text of the book. If you're interested in that, buy it; if you're looking for the visuals, definitely skip it!"
2,Notes for Romeo and Juliet,"I would not recommend this for my students. I would purchase a modern day English translation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" that has the original words on the left side and modern day English on the right side instead of purchasing this. You really can't enjoy Shakespeare this way. Don't cheat yourself from a good education and read only this. Take the time to read the original play along with a good translation. You will be glad that you did."
5,cliff note are a lifesaver,Cliff notes help you to sort out the Shakespeareian language and better understand the plot.It is difficult to break down the vocabulary and the Cliff notes are such a help.There are many characters and the notes help you keep track of them.
1,Warranty: Purely Fictional,"This clock is made with a cheap Chinese movement. Nothing surprising about that. I think every wall clock I've purchased in the past 5 years has the same poor movement and many of them have failed prematurely.Which is what happened with this one, after maybe 6 months. The retailer told me to contact Timekeeper for warranty service. I have emailed and called repeatedly over the past 3 months. On the first call it sounded like the problem was going to be resolved. After a couple of weeks, no replacement. I called and again they said it would be taken care of. After that I cannot get anyone to respond to email or the phone.Their clocks are cheap and if they fail, you can just expect to toss them in the trash and find another. They obviously aren't going to stand behind what they sell (I'd say manufacture but the Chinese do that)."
4,Satisfied,We are pleased with our recent retro clock purchase. It appears to be well made and is keeping time perfectly. I would have preferred the silver balls to be made of metal like the remainder of the clock rather than plastic.
1,Very Cheap Quality,"Entirely made of cheap plastic. Item arrived with many scuff marks on the plastic silver balls which showed the black plastic underneath. Hands are same color as rest of clock, making it almost impossible to tell time without a good, hard look. Item picture does not match the description. There is no way this item is worth more than about $8 maximum."
4,packaging problems???,really liked clock - it was my first choice but it came damaged and i returned for a replacement and it came with same damage. i wonder if they sent back clock i returned. sent that one back and ordered different clock.
4,some serious talent,"this cd has some real style,some tunes are quite worthy of joe satrioni's level of guitar god statute.beautiful songs-compelling playings."
4,Nice...,Nice melodies. What I really like is that Marty doesn't play fast all the time (like Malmsteen or Morse). Marty has this relaxing style of playing.
5,great album,"first time i bought this album i was expecting a heavy guitar riff & solo just like his stuff on megadeth. but it's totally different, it's an awesome new age album which contain a beautiful melody in every songs.my fav songs on this album is ""west"" .if you like a a melodic guitar solo you wont be dissapointed by this one. all track on this album is GOOD!"
3,Overrated,"I enjoyed the movie, but 5 stars is not accurate in my opinion. I would give it 3.5 - 4 stars. I was interested in the psychological elements, and I love dramas. This movie had those elements, but not in a spectacular way."
3,Weird,"Lots of ""time travel"" so if you want a linear movie buy something else. Listen to commentary so it will make more sense."
4,mind games,I loved the movie and gave it a four stars! i also did love the ending. like to know how to get that last song alright by oliva d'abo cant find it any were!!!
5,Valuable Life Lesson,Take it to heart story. Filmed on our northern middle Tennessee farm! Would love a copy of this movie:) Loved it!
4,The unseen revolution,"Obviously, I liked the book. Drucker describes the pension fund industry and it's growing importance in the capital markets. But remember this is just a new edition of the 1976 classic ""The unseen revolution"" by Harper & Row (with a new preface)..."
3,Title is misleading.,"This book is by no means the 'elements' of the theory of Markov Processes. In a book titled as such, I would like to see some english before math. Nonetheless, I have to agree that once the theory is grasped, this book would be good for the math part."
5,GREAT BOOK,I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL THE COLD. iT IS AMAZING THAT ANY OF THEM SURVIVED.
5,"""Gripping"" is only word I can use to describe Endurance.","Because individual tastes vary, I sometimes hesitate to recommend movies, restaurants or even a good books for that matter. However, this is not one of those times. As an armchair adventurer, I found this incredible story of courage and hardship second to none. More exciting than John Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"" (even I find that hard to believe), more eyewitness accounts than in Sebastian Junger's ""The Perfect Storm"" and overall more gripping than Robin Knox Johnson's ""A World of My Own"". Shackelton was a true leader of men."
5,Adventure stories don't get any better than this.,"I read this book during a January cold spell in Wisconsin, and it surely made my necessary chores outside easier! Hard to imagine conquering the elements as Shackelton and his crew did, without benefits of modern technology, and without giving up. The photographs document some of the details that we wouldn't otherwise believe possible."
2,It was too slow to finish,"The book could not keep my attention. The early details just dragged on until I just moved on. I feel obligated to finish since I bought the book, It is however, a chore."
2,Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage,"I ordered the book while sailing in Antarctica and although I received a picture of the cover of the book, the book itself cannot be opened. I do not know if this was caused by my location at the time but it happened nonetheless. I hope you will try to send it to me again. Thank you. David Nearon"
4,minus a star for British accent,"minus a star for British accent, which i have no prejudice against, and i do enjoy it in movies, but not so much on an audio book. I'm just not used to hearing it without any visual context. nonetheless, it's a great production and quality of the voice is excellent. narrator is able to switch back and forth between scottish and brittish seamlessly. after a few hours, i finally got somewhat used to it, though."
5,Endurance:Shackleton's Incredible Voyage,This book was exactly what I wanted and it arrived in great shape. The service was excellent; thank you!
3,I too endured...,"I don't often say this, but stories like this are better off on film. Their struggle was beyond the tizzy-fit a child suffers when his mother is late to pick him up from CCD (church class), believe me, I've been there, on that curb, waiting.But as Shackleton and his crew become numb to everything this unfriendly environment whips up and throws down on them, the reader, too, becomes something of a soldier in choosing life over death, or in this case, incomplete versus fully read.I fortunately (?) endured."
5,A True Story of Survival,"There have been some amazing personalities in the roll call of great explorers, and Ernest Shackleton is near the top of the list.A traveler with Robert Falcon Scott in the first quest for the South Pole in 1902, Shackleton's expedition with the ""Endurance"" was a terrible story that may have ended in failure to make the pole, but a success in survival.The writings of Shackleton and a number of his shipmates make for an intriguing and insightful narrative; how Endurance was caught in the polar ice, spending more than a year on an ice floe, marooned on a lonely rock of an island and the amazing journey in a life boat to a whaling station...it's all too incredible, yet it happened.Shackleton was a real swashbuckler, not always the best judge in talent for his expeditions and the best planner, but as many have said, when adversity arose, he and his people rose to the occasion again and again.A great read for anyone interested about the ""Heroic Age."""
5,"Incredible, Indeed","I am generally averse to any material, in film or literature, that deals with ice--sorry for the pun--but it leaves me cold. However, after thumbing through the opening pages of ENDURANCE, I was hooked by Alfred Lansing's vivid account of the Shackleton expedition to the Antarctic. With over 400 plus reviews, all offering superlatives for this engrossing real-life adventure, the only thing that I can add is that reading it can be a kind of test of endurance. I'm one of those few who'd heard of Shackleton but somehow managed to avoid knowing how the story ends; by the time I'd reached the final words of this epic tale, I wept."
4,Wow!,"There is no story that has ever been told as amazing as the one told in ""Endurance."" I try and try to comprehend some of the obstacles that this crew overcame, but it is totally uncomprehendable. This book and this story is proof that the human spirit can endure the unimaginable and that willpower alone is more powerfull then any tangible substance.This story makes Kraukauer's ""Into Thin Air"" look like a summer picnic. This is not a story of one particular event in which people were able to overcome one inpassable obstacle, yet it is a story whereby a crew overcomes obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. This book makes the movie ""Rudy"" laughable as a story of overcoming all odds. WOW!! If you havent read this book, buy it imediately."
5,outstanding!,"I thought ""the Long Walk"" was an excellent book, but this might surpasses even that! The only bad thing about reading a book like this is that it has an ending!!"
5,"Endurance, a thrilling non-stop action book.",Shackleton was a courageous leader who endured through the worst of times. Shackleton was the best leader to ever live. This was my favorite book of all time. I hope that it becomes a movie; it would be a great movie because the whole thing is adventure. They should have Sean Connery as Shackleton
5,sleepless nights,"When I finally forced myself to put the book down at 3am, I lay in the dark for an hour with my heart pounding. A daily source of inspiration and a great read!"
5,"""Incredible"" is an understatement","I went into this book, after reading the jacket, thinking, ""Oh, this sounds interesting."" By the end, the book had moved me to tears three or four times. I cannot say enough about this fascinating, unreal, unbelievable story and the powerful effect it had on me. Never before have I read of such fortitude and awe-inspiring strength than that exhibited by these brave, amazing men. It was such a terrific read, I didn't want the story to end! But thank God, for those who lived to tell it, it finally did. If you like true-life adventure, even just a little bit, then you must read this tremendous story. Remarkable and unbelievable from beginning to end."
5,Endurance: a true life spectacle,"In simplest form, ""Endurance"" is about a group of men fighting against the elements to reach home. But the book is so much more than this.The book holds within its pages the wonder and magic of the real true-life adventures, as if they were told from a fellow sailor.Alfred Lansing has the amazing literary power to bring to life one of the most stunning survivor stories in the history of the world."
5,Possibly the Greatest True Life Adventure Story Ever Written,"As of this writting, I am the 218th person to review this book. The 218th person to tell you that Lansing's account of the epic voyage of The Endurance is possibly the greatest true life adventure story ever written. You just wouldn't believe this actually happened if it weren't so well documented. Soon to be a major motion picture, this story is one for the ages. How the hell did it remain obscure for so many years?"
5,Nerve Racking and Captivating,"My wife had to grab my leg and ask me if I was alright while I read about Shackleton's troubles on the bus ride home. Even knowing the ultimate outcome did not make me any less nervous when the crew of the Endurance faced each incredible challenge. Lansing's prose captivated me and took me away from a warm Seattle Metro bus and put me there in Antarctica floating on Camp Patience and gasping for breath after escaping a leapord seal attack, shivering with anticipation as our craft rushed up each icy fifty foot swell, I was there! Everyone should read this to escape into a world of adventure that cannot be matched again!"
5,"Absolutely fantastic, true story","I read the book in two nights, it was riveting to see the trials these men endured to survive. The story gives the details matter-of-factly (explaining even the mundane events of each day) but is nonetheless very entertaining, since each day could oftentimes be their last."
4,Interesting story,"I enjoyed the story and was amazed these guys could survive. This is basically a history book though. Not a lot of variation or surprise. They were cold, wet and or hungry most of the time."
5,"Do they really survive? No way! But it's true, WOW!",Two weeks and I devoured this book. Riding the Long Island Railroad helped. I find it hard to believe that these men had the strong desire to press on in such a barren place. I like to be adventureous but this blows me away. AWESOME!
5,A Great Adventure!!!,"A Perfect Storm, Into Thin Air neither can top the raw adventure and true courage of the men of the Endurance."
5,a book that changed my life,"When I found this in a catalog, discovering it was still in print (11th ed.? 13th?) I hopped up and down. I ordered a copy, and when I held it in my own sweaty mitts I did a little jig right there in the store. My copy's getting a little threadbare from loaning, and a couple of those people have since bought THEIR own copy for loaning. (The catalog where I spotted this called it the first book they'd ever seen that lived up to its encomiums. I agree.) When I read it as a child I found it literally incredible - I refused to believe it until I looked up Shackleton in all the references I could find. Astounding book. <N>"
5,"Much more than survival, this was a story about leadership in my opinion","I don't disagree with the rave reviews about this book as a incredible story of survival, but the main thing I got from it was Shackletons ability to create and redefine teams is what really makes this story a standout. As the story unfolds, from the interviewing process which he used to build the initial crew, down to the determining who would be in which tent, this is a story of a leader that knew how to build teams that worked."
4,"Good reading, amazin story, basic learning for managers.","I purchased this item for two reasons: it was recommended by one friend and coz I heard it was really useful for managers. At the end I did not find it so useful, it has some basic lessons to do good management, all of them draw by you beacuse it does not have any specific section with such a purpose. The really good thing is that the real story is amazing."
4,Good delivery and quality,came on time and in good condition! And very inexpensive compared to about 15 dollars at the book store!
3,"Good diary-type documentation, lacks in heroic story","The title ""Endurance"" is appropriate - it required this to plod through the book. I wanted to be inspired by this wonderful story of human spirit but found only the facts. The work required to construct this information is very good but reading it left me cold on the floes."
3,5th grade level reading,"Quite the struggle to Endure and it became tiring toward the last forty pages....""Get over that mountain!"""
2,Somewhat interesting but NOT exciting,"This book almost put me to sleep half way through the ""adventure"". From a historical perspective it was mildly interesting-that's all."
2,Not very good,"This book is writen like an encyclopedia. It would be great if you needed to write a story about Shackleton, but reading it for a regular book is horrible. It is quite boring due to its encyclopedia like nature. While the story is a ""gripping tale"" the way it is presented is as boring as anything."
3,Historically Boring,"I had to read this book for my school over the summer, and I have to say that I was got very bored after the first couple of chapters. It was like reading a history book, and seeing that History is one of my worst classes I didn't enjoy it very much. There were too many dates and information to keep tract of to enjoy it."
5,Incredible!,This is one of the most incredible stories of survival ever! The book is well written and goes into great detail. I listened to the audiobook and found myself sitting in my car after reaching my destination just to hear more. Highly recommended.
4,Makes me feel like I'm on the journey with them,"Serial, factual account of the amazing journey. Writing style is not particularly creative. The story is tremendously fascinating. Take a trip to Antartica."
4,A Gripping Quick Read,"One of the best-known of the many books about Englishman Shakleton's 1915 expedition to cross the South Pole, this is essentially a quick, easy-reading adventure story. Aptly titled, it's a pretty gripping and amazing story, and will put to shame any bad camping story of one's own. I guess what one emerges with is sheer amazement that anyone managed to survive the conditions these men were exposed to. A nice modern companion book to this is ""North to the Night."""
5,"Shakespeare epitomizes drama, Shackleton - heroic leadership","To say this is a book about a polar expedition is to say that ""Lear"" is a play about a king going mad. It is a story of how high the human spirit can soar, how much it can endure, the true meaning of leadership, and so much more! Add to the mix brilliant writing and you have a 'precious jewel set in printed pages'. Read it, I guarantee you will wonder why it is so little known, but you will know why it is so deeply loved by all who have read it!"
5,Probably the best single Shackleton book,"There's been a seeming flood of books and movies about the 1915-6 Shackleton polar expedition in recent years, but this 1959 account is probably the best and most concisely written. Great pacing, and character development throughout. The agonizing slowness of the disaster, the recovery and the almost two years it took for the crew to escape the Antarctic are nail-bitingly well done. If you only read one book about Shackleton, this should be the one."
5,Endurance is an understatement,"It's amazing to be stuck for 2 years without rescue but it's even more impressive that no one died. The book follows the masterful leadership of Shackleton as his ship gets stuck and eventually crushed in sheets of ice. The writing is non sensationalized and feels like it came from a member of the crew. To clear any confusion, this book was originally written in the 1950's which explains how the author interviewed the original crew."
4,Wonderous Story,"I was looking for something different to read and decided on this. The Good: Well written with a good pace. Filled with diary ertries, and very factual information which I found amazing since Shackleton's journey was almost 100 years ago. The Bad: Some nautical terms I was not familiar with. Character development was not strong, but with a story as momentous as this, I understood. I recommend this book even if you do not think you would enjoy it. The 3 books I read prior to this were Robocalypse, The Night Circus, and a Sandy Koufax biography, just to give you an iddea of where I am coming from. Enjoy!"
3,amazing story,One gets weary just reading the exploits described in this book. A truly amazing story but told in such painstaking detail that you nearly have to possess the same endurance as the characters to finish it. Almost unbelievable.
5,Astounding! The greatest survival story I have ever read,MUST READ! Amazing account of one of the most heroic survival journeys ever completed. Everything we go through in life will pale in comparison.
5,Put this one in the shopping cart and proceed to check out.,"What are you waiting for? Don't delay any longer. Probably the best and most exciting book I have ever read. Not one dull spot in the whole book. Total engrossment word by word. From what I can tell this book is the most free flowing account of Shakelton's expedition, leaving out no major events from begining to end. This book makes you want to know what happened to each of these men after they all were rescued. It also leaves you wondering what happened to the other support boat that was part of the expedition. So now I'll have to read Shakelton's own book ""South""."
3,A fantastic story about a fantastic journey.,"A fantastic story about a fantastic journey....the aborted attempt by Shackleton and crew to cross the continent of Antartica in 1915. I gave it only three stars because I found the writing to be a little dry and repetitive, especially in comparison to other great non-fiction stories I have read. Also I thought the book ended too abruptly, without much followup on the characters I had come to care about. However, the story itself is so strong that I would recommend the book. It about the triumph of Shackleton's leadership and his crew against unimaginable conditions. It demonstrates what can be achieved with spirit and discipline, even when pitted against the most inhospitable landscape on our planet!"
4,"Great Story, Told in an Okay Manner","Wow. Endurance to say the least. This is a truly remarkable story. I'm not sure much in human history could rival it. The story speaks for itself, and if you like to read non-fiction adventure, then this book is a great read.I had two small problems with the author. He doesn't do a good job of sharing an opinion on what it must have been like to be going through all of this. I kept wondering, ""I wonder what Ambrose could have done with this?"". The author spends a great deal of time (too much, frankly) detailing their see voyages, but I never felt like he was trying to put me, the reader, on the boat to go along for the ride.The other issue I had was what I considered a rather abrupt ending to the story. There should have been a short bio on each of the characters and what became of their life. Nothing in depth. Just a few sentences on what each of these guys did with their lives after this whole ordeal would have brought some more real life feel into this."
5,"Well written, excellent book",One of the best books I have read. Could not put it down. It is amazing true story that should be an inspiration to anyone who reads it.
4,Page turner,"The Endeavor story is a page turner to rival the best mysteries....and it's true! What was lacking was character development. Lansing quotes others as calling Shackleton one of the great leaders of men in history, but then fails to explain how his leadership skills managed to keep his crew together through their remarkable adventures without a single loss of life. Even afer reading about it, it's still hard to believe what Shackleton and his crew accomplished."
5,"Great Story, Great Adventure","An incredible adventure is documented in this book. I'm surprised to find that the original book was published in 1956 and a movie has not come from it. The only criticism I have is that the book was too short. Through the writing in this book it seemed the crew never gave up. Endurance seems the perfect name. With today's movie special effects technology, people would come in droves to see this story on the big screen."
3,Antarctica 3,"I have not quite finished reading this book but expect to do so shortly.In the past I have read ""The Worst Journey in the World"" by Apseley Cherry-Garrard which details Scotts Expedition to the South Pole plus a mid winter trek to obtain eggs from the Emperor Penguins.In my opinion this book does not rate as highly as the one referred to above but it certainly has some heart stopping moments.A good read and one I would recommend."
5,This story truly is incredible,"""Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage"" makes you hold your breath from beginning to end. Each and every time you think to yourself ""this situation cannot possibly get any worse"", it does. Which makes the story and the readability of the book that much better. You will find yourself immersed in the team's struggles and triumphs and you will leave feeling as if you were apart of this incredible voyage. Forget 5 stars. Let's give this one a 6."
5,A great read,"Bundle up while reading this... the author does an excellent job of making the reader go through the truly unimaginable hardships of the men on board. It's inspiring to know what humans can do, and this book is wonderfully written."
4,Makes Wintering in Minnesota Seem Like a Piece of Cake,Be prepared to clear out your calendar for the day because you just don't want to leave these guys drifting on a piece of ice out on the Antartica ocean. This story is truly about heroism and the will to live. The author hits the ground(ice)running and never lets up.My prediction is Spielberg is going to grab this epic and run with it.Land Ho!
5,An incredible book,"Alfred Lansing's book, Endurance, dramatically details the 1914 expedition to the Antarctic led by Sir Ernest Shackleton. Although a non-fiction book, Lansing manages to make it read like a thriller, adventure. He wrote his story using first person accounts, interviews of survivors, journal entries, etc. While sometimes history can be a bit dry, this novel truly makes you feel a part of the adventure and reads very quickly. Ernest Shackleton's leadership abilities ensure not only the survival of the crew, but demonstrate his character as a man. Crew and officers were treated alike and shared in the duties of survival. Order was maintained and his personality and command of the situation enabled the group to survive what could have been a disaster."
5,My all-time favorite book.,"The first 40 pages seem drab, but then the story takes off, and I never wanted to put the book down! Yet the first 40 pages are essential to understanding the type of man that Shackleton was, why his men had such incredible devotion to him. They trusted each and every decision Shackleton made, ultimately saving their lives. It is succinctly written, and often quite witty. It's the best true-life adventure I've ever read!"
5,One of the best books that I have ever read.,And I thought it was hard to walk through ten miles of snow to school.Could not get over how tough and brave these men were.There are many things to learn from this book.
5,You must read this,"Being a sci-fi, mystery and action book fan, I didn't know what to make of my friend when he lent me ""Endurance"". I started reading it Friday night when I got home from work, and finished it about 4am Saturday morning, starting out with a beer or two, and finishing with coffee and hot chocolate (couldn't do the powdered milk). If there was ever a book that would inspire schoolkids and executives alike, it would be this one. Leadership, teamwork, perserverence, positive attitude, etc. What is most incredible is the time in which this adventure occured and the fact that survival in their incredible conditions was achieved. Like many reviewers, I would love to see a movie made from this book, with the same budget and attention to detail as ""Titanic"". Last note: Read this aloud to your family.. one chapter per night.."
2,What was the point?,"As I read Endurance, I searched for a point a morale in the book, I was very disappointed because there wasn't one.Endurance was some what like Robinson Crusoe, full of useless details. Do I seem like one who would care how many seals you killed? The book could have been shortned by a lot if the details were removed. Don't get me wrong some parts of the book did provide for some good supspense, ie would they make it to South Georgia?,but I just didn't enjoy it.Another problem with the book was the point of view the book was written in, Who was the narrator? You could never tell who was talking, and the diary exerpts just simply needed to be removed."
1,Endurance,"Definitely non-fiction, but written in an easily read manner. Even knowing how it all turns out, it was a great adventure."
1,I didnt like it!!!,I am probly the only person that says he doesnt like this book but thats ok.Even though the there is a plot i dont think the auther didn't do a good job writing the book. Me and my friend both read the book and we did not like it. I hope they rewrite this book in the future!!
1,This is it- The King of adventure books,"the adventure stories to end all adventure stories. If you like adventure, travel stories then this is the # 1 book of all.Can you imagine the feeling that Shackleton and the men had when they sighted him and he counted all 22 men alive."
1,WORST BOOK EVER DO NOT BUY,this book is terrible the first 40 pages of it they describe the crash and then they describe the crash again the next 200 pages
1,I didn't receive the Item yet.,I didn't receive the Item yet. once I receive it I will give my review. I'm expecting to recieve the Item by January 23rd.
4,"Good book, great story.","While this book dragged in parts, it was an excellent (and detailed) account of an amazing adventure. I enjoyed it."
5,Remedy,"Aptly named, this is a stunning story of courage, strength and perseverance. Good medicine for a nation of whiners."
5,A great read...,This book is a treasure. It's hands down the best retelling of a survivor tale that I've read. The author just tells the story in such a simple and yet compelling way. The details that are included are incredible. And the story is totally miraculous. I recommend this book to anyone who likes history or tales of courage/adventure. I was blown away by Shackletons (and his men's) accomplishment in the face of what was should have been sure death.
5,EXCELLENT,"Plan on traveling to Antartica in the future, and even though this was a failed expedition I always wanted to learn more about this. Took this book to read on vacation, and finished it by the 2nd day - couldn't put it down. In my opinion, this has got to be one of the greatest stories of survival and determination in modern history, and the author keeps you hooked the entire way through. Details of emotions and struggle become that much more profound when you realize the extensive research that was done in crafting this book. An amazing tale of the power and determination of the human spirit - we all can learn from Shakleton and his men, and Lansing plays a brilliant role as a medium of delivery."
3,Conrad at sea!,"This book was titled ""Children of the Sea"" in the American edition. It's a quite good book, some what the form of it falls in between a novel and a shortstory. It tells the tale about the rough life at sea on a ship with sails! It's moving to hear about these sailors out on open sea, their lives depend on eachother, then they reach the destination and split up never to see eachother again. Perhaps the most memorable part of the novel is when the ship enters the dirty dark industrial city of London, after life at the merciless but fresh sea, Conrads description of London is almost Dickens like in its somber visions."
3,"Interesting, Not Amazing.","I came across Narcissus as a reference to one of Faulkner's inspirations in writing As I Lay Dying. As the latter book was superb, I suspected the former would perhaps shine as brightly. I was definately wrong.It's not that the book is bad--certainly not. But the book, as a story, isn't all that riveting, and as a social commentary is not anything that most haven't seen time and again (that Conrad's work came before much of what we've seen is, of course, of some merit).From an academic standpoint the book is probably worth a read. Historically, it's clearly important as it effectively captures the mood of an era long past. As a study in literature I found Conrad's employment of seamless shifts between the first and thrid person as subtle and deceptively powerful--clearly this is where Faulkner borrowed style from the work."
2,"I agree, it's an interesting but not amazing reading","The nautical setting is interesting: Recognizable to those familiar with sailing, a learning experience for those of us who are not. One star.The characters are interesting: Ranging from hardend sailors with strong work ethics to unpricipled slackers, with a mysterious black shipmate (who may or may not be faking illness) thrown in to shake them all up. One star.What I didn't find interesting was Conrad's writing style. His descriptions contained far too many confusing similes, his run-on sentences and three-page paragraphs were tiresome, and his sudden switch from third-person to first-person narration was a bit bewildering. No stars."
1,Lame! Vampire Romance,"Ugh. This book was bad. I knew it was going to be bad when the ex-vampire hunter, Regan, is walking toward her car after dark in the park (where vampires roam free) and is afraid. Afraid? I'm sorry, but if a heroine is going to be billed as an ex-vampire hunter, I don't want to read within the first few pages that she's scared to walk to her car alone in the dark. I must admit that I only made it half-way through this book. There was no believable reason for Joaquin to feel so strongly toward Regan. The whole story just seemed flat, underdeveloped, and shallow. And then when the werewolf bite happened and she was all, yeah, let's go to South Dakota on a whim, I was done.I had read another Amanda Ashley vampire romance (historical) and thought it wasn't bad. But this one was very poorly written. And word to the poster who mentioned Regan's ""robot coffeemaker"". Cringeworthy."
5,"Great story, I like it",I like this book and plan on reading it again.I like all the books by Amanda Ashley that I have read. So far I haven't found one that I didn't like.She is a great writer.
4,A Treasure,"Received as a gift this collection is real treat for any fan. Most entertaining is following along to his represented recordings of the songs to catch the variations from text to vocalization.The drawings are a bit scarry, he must have kept them from his analyst's visits. They are a combo of Shel Silverstein and kindergarten art class."
4,I Got Dylan's Autograph in Mine,The book was given to me by my FIRST Love.I saw Dylan play in Milwaukee at the Riverside theatre & was determined to get his autograph/meet him.SOMEHOW it did...
3,Use This Correctly and Don't Cheat!,"This is not the Wuthering book by Emily Bronte. It is a Cliffs Notes Study Guide version. This is good to read but only if you have read the whole book by Bronte and you have to write a book report and just need some references from the Cliff Notes version if there was something in the book that you didn't understand. Don't try to con your teacher by only reading the Cliff Notes version. Just read the book and read a great story and impress your teacher. It always amazes me how dumb some students can be by trying to cheat with Cliff Notes, I mean the teacher always can tell when someone has done it too so it's not like they are fooling anyone. Cliff Notse are very helpful and have gotten a bad rap from sneaky cheaters!"
3,F/18 - Hornet,"The secondary source provider delivered an excellent product with instructor guide. Since the software was developed for an old microsoft version, I get limited functionality on my computer. But if you have the correct microsoft driver, you will find the software very helpful. There is a good set of tutorials that you will be able to use with the very detailed instructor guide."
2,SLOW Write Speed,"This USB flash drive has clean lines and a nice small form factor. However, the terrible write speed makes the use of the flash drive painful.The Connect3D website lists the specs for this drive as:Sequential Read: 17MB/s (max)Sequential Write: 14MB/s (max)Informal useage of this flash drive seemed to be quite a bit slower than my Lexar Lightning USB drive. I ran the SiSoft Sandra Flash Drive benchmark (using 64MB files) and got the following results:Read performance - 18.6 MB/secWrite performance - 5.5 MB/secWith write performance like that, all I can say is STAY AWAY !!"
4,A wit reminiscent of Vance,"If you like Jack Vance, you'll be pleased with Hughe's writing style. His command of the language, especially where dialogue is concerned, is refreshingly sharp with subtle nuances of irony and sarcasm. A must for someone who feels like smiling after finishing the final lines."
2,In the style of Jack Vance,A new author attempts to write in the style of Jack Vance. Jack Vance does it better.
2,Too much verbal cleverness for me!,"I didn't like Fool's Errant. Although the plot exhibited some really creative twists on the old ""traveling story"" and the characters were well-drawn and multi-dimensional, the prose was annoying and invasive.Hughes appears to be very much in love with his linguistic cleverness and overuses it as a stylistic device. calling residents of a monastery ""monasts"" and a bathing room an ""ablutory"" were cute and would have been much more effective if they were the only examples. But with at least one such ploy every few pages, it got old. I don't want my Latin dictionary by my side when I read modern fiction, I just want to escape into the story. I doubt I'll buy another book by Matthew Hughes."
1,Insufferably bad,"Tolstoy has the aesthetic/philosophical insight of a thin-lipped Puritan. His conclusions are dogmatic and authoritarian. What is art, according to Tolstoy? That which gives communal emotional expression in glory of God. All else is vanity, alas: mere self-indulgent Hedonism. Follow the precepts in this book and watch your horizons begin to narrow. The fact that Tolstoy was a distinguished novelist and that he spent so much time thinking about these matters is of no consequence. As many have said before, Tolstoy was a very good novelist but a very bad philosopher."
2,Click wheel problems,"This skin looked pretty good and was thick enough to protect my nano, but I repeatedly had to struggle to get the click wheel to work. This was a real pain when adjusting the volume and trying to skip forward (it would press the middle button rather than skip forward). I just stopped using it and gave it away."
1,Not a good deal.......,"These are good tasting bars, but I regularly get these from Sam's club for about $11, for the same box. I have been buying them for about a year now."
1,Negro Work Songs & Calls [Rounder],"This is possibly the worst transfer of data into digital format that I have ever heard. I have a 30 year old copy of this album on vinyl that I carefully recorded in MP3 format. The quality of this home recording maintains the fidelity of the original recording infinitely better than this CD. I bought the CD hoping for a better digital format, not worse. I am sending back this opened and played CD to Amazon.com today. Let's see how they respond to a return that is based soley on the fact that it is an incredibly inferior product. One final note. The music of the original recording will make any effort you take to find one of the older vinyls well worth your effort."
4,One of many accounts of the Early Church Fathers....,"this account has interesting history of the way the Catholic Church began with an amazing bibliography, references to other accounts of this history. very intersting!"
4,good text,"This is an older book that we are using to study the early church and the influence, roles and theology of the patristic church ancestors."
4,Excellent introduction,"I have enjoyed this book very much. The author went to great effort to tie each early Christian writer into the historical situation of the time so that you could see what the thinking was that he was writing to correct, and what the debates were for the Christians on how to word ideas upon which they agreed, but also how they answered pagan or heretical writers in defense of the orthodox path.It was interesting and well worth the purchase price.I'd gladly pass it on to adults and teenagers who were wanting more than the elementary level introductions to the Early Church Fathers found in most books. For the younger kids, I'd hand them one of the books by Mike Aquilina instead. But for the older kids who are ready for it, this is a really good book."
3,Good additional information,"The book provides a large amount of early Christian writings with particularly helpful footnote comments and an exhaustive index section with references to Biblical scriptures. As such, one can find good information for research on early Christian Church history."
5,Gutsy Ladies,"These ladies were given a very hard time, not because of a lack of talent, but because some people didn't want them to exercise their right to free speech. They came through it with class. This is a great album, moving just a little away from their country roots. The single and title track ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time."
3,Poor description that CD is not the actual album,Made the same mistake as above that CD is not the actual album. I guess I was in too much of a hurry when I ordered.
2,Returned,I returned this product because it was 3 songs of the CD. I paid $13 and thought I was getting the entire CD. Gave it a 2 star because I was able to return the product hassle-free.
2,Not Ready to Make Nice,Love the Dixie Chicks and love their music but this CD is a rip off. Don't be fooled...it only has two songs on it and neither one is extended length. Would have been an okay deal at $5.
1,...where is the rest of the music?,"ditto to the rest of the reviews.... I would have even loved getting some old cuts on this CD to keep the 2 on there company... but I kept trying to find out where the rest of the music was and resolved that there were only two songs... sorry Chicks... love your music and your statement, but give me a break.... I hope the money goes to a good cause... like free speech... that would be nice."
1,Very unhappy with this purchase,"THIS SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, BUT YOUR RETURN POLICY SAYSYOU CAN'T RETURN OPENED CDs so if I can't return it, perhaps others canlearn from this what can happen when you order online. I thought I was getting the whole CD and when I opened it and put it on, it turned out to have the song Not Ready to Make Nice, one other song and then some video of Not Ready to Make Nice. I checked with a friend who has the album and she said there should be lots of other songs on it. Can you send me the album I thought I was buying?"
1,not even a good coaster,"Hello out there peoples!! If you want true and talented sister acts then check out the Mandrel sisters, because they are the real deal, not these spice girl clones!"
2,Single,"I had thought i was buying the album, but it is only the single. It has 2 songs on it, but the dixie chicks are great."
2,misrepresented,I had no idea that I was getting just a few songs on a CD. Thought it was the entire album. I felt cheated.
3,"songs are great, but only 2","I thought for $12 I was getting the whole CD. I was very disappointed that it was so short.That being said, the songs are awesome!"
1,I want my money back,I thought I was buying a complete Dixie Chicks CD and all I got was two songs for the price of a normal CD. I want to return this for a refund.The two songs are good. I think it has a very short video also. The packaging also sucks because it is really sparse and misleading.I thought it was a joke. Amazon should put a warning at the top of the page stating that this is really two singles and a really short video and not a complete CD. I notice I'm not the only person who was fooled.
1,This is not the whole album!,"Be sure that if you order this CD, it is what you want. This is NOT the album, just a couple of songs."
4,Book thus far is great!,"This book would seem to be the same as so many other books on the subject but as I read through it deeper, it tends to give a more realistic approach to this industry."
4,Well worth reading,"Whether you're a beginning or experienced investor, nothing beats reading from the experiences of others who have been there. Real estate investing should be treated for what is it is---A serious, profit generating, long term business and ""2 Years to a Million"" provides a good foundation for making deals and evaluating properties along with a Lessons Learned section after each chapter. This is a great book for anyone interested in becoming a full time real estate investor.In order to succeed in this business you need to educate yourself and ""2 Years to a Million"" should be a part of it. Matthew Martinez has layed out a program for long term prosperity in easy to understand terms, solid real estate rules that MUST be followed and entertaining personal anecdotes of what really happens to investors. I highly recommend this book as part of your overall education in real estate investing."
2,Nothing new in here.,"Thought I'd get a bit of advice on the present situation in the real estate market. Author touched on it briefly in one of his latter chapters. I did notice that his 3 first deals, in which he said he made his million, were noticably scant on financials. I would recommend however, ""The unofficial guide to real estate investing"" A much better buy.Mike"
4,Nice Read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The author really made this book an enjoyable read. The only reason I'm giving this review 4 stars, rather than 5, is because I felt he left out some things he shouldn't have. I'd recommend picking up this book, along withBubble Proof: Real Estate Strategies that Work in any Market. Bubble Proof is also a very nice read, and the author talks about much of what Matthew didn't."
4,gives you the basics,"The title is a little deceptive... ""2 years to a million in real estate"" made me assume he is talking about INCOME within 2 years, instead he is talking about HOLDINGS... several buildings which total about a mil, which he probably owes close to a mil on.He used a strategy to pull out equity from previous properties and his primary residence to finance his new purchases, sometimes on interest-only mortgages... high LTVs, risky stuff. I'd like to see how it's playing out right now, but if it's working and he's still able to cash flow the units, GREAT! Otherwise, I'd be a little concerned as the markets plummet 20% per year in some areas.AT THE SAME TIME, he said that after he did a few of these, he was able to quit his job, living just on the cash flow from his properties, WHICH IS AWESOME I THINK... It's hard to make properties cash flow, especially in areas like Boston where this guy is from. If he bought in good neighborhoods, I think he did a decent job."
5,Coming from a guy who has read a few RE books...,"Ive purchased a few of the highly recommended real estate books on Amazon and this one takes the cake. Some RE books simply put me to sleep but this is a Very easy ready with powerful information. Once i picked it up, i couldn't put it down and finished the book in a few hours. Seems to get right to the heart of the matter where other books spend a ton of time on fluff. Note: this book was written during the real estate boom which skews things a little. But the key pts still apply. Highly recommend"
2,But is it credible?,"The book follows the author on his path to success through real estate management/investment. When I reached the point in the book where the author made his first real estate investment purchase in the summer of 2002 I paused to consider the housing market he succeeded in. With a copyright of 2006, the author must have generated the bulk of his successes between 2002 and late 2005/early 2006 - heady times for the real estate market. His claim that the book will ""... teach you how to duplicate my achievements..."" is questionable given the present housing market. If he were starting out today would he have achieved so much so fast?The book is easy to read and I like the way points are summarized at the end of each chapter. I'm just concerned that someone whose advice is based upon an experience gained during very favorable housing market conditions might not hold up under tougher times."
3,A Good Read for the Beginner,"This is a good book to get an overview of a successful real estate investor. Book is not for the experienced investor, unless they have been unsuccesful w/ their current practices.As a newbie, go ahead and read, but don't look for the keys to being really successful, look to this book for the basics."
3,"Ok book, better out there","I thought this was an ok book but I must say that i agree that the author is a little bit too young to be qualified as an ""expert"" in real estate. Overall, good read but definately not excellent."
5,2 Years to a Million in Real Estate,It is a very practicing and inspiring book. the book provides lots very useful skills and experiences that just what I need as a real estate investor.
