5,"12 Years later, still my favorite CD","It's the soulful Ry Cooder sound and the smart lyrics that make this disc ageless. I love this CD and I recommend it highly to you. It's my D.I.D.I just purchased my third copy of this disc. I play it so often it just wears out.Join us - the select few in North America who know this band is one of the best. You may not know them because their US record label couldn't promote a cure of the common cold, but buying this CD will enlist you as a select member of the secret Texas admiration society."
4,Glad I found this one.,"I liked everything about this book. It is like a strange dream you have one night and wake up not knowing how things are really going to turn out. If you like books you can feel and smell, you will like this great little read."
2,Reading a tri-fold brochure would be more helpful,"I strongly agree with the other review written for this booklet. I bought it hoping for insight. I was studying the festival in a public folklore class, and thought this would help me get an insiders view. It was like reading about a beautiful backyard garden being described by a child looking through a small knot-hole in the fence. Not helpful."
4,Lena & Gabor,"This is the sound track of the original ""LENA & GABOR"" by A&R; Recording Studio produced during Oct-Nov, 1969 by SKYE Recording Co LTD N.Y. The original LP's went out of production in 1970. This album was used during the 1970's to demo hi-end speakers and stereo systems as the quality of it nearly the same as the Direct-to Disc recordings of that time. I bought 20-25 original albums back then and still have them, but wanted a CD for my car.I recommend this CD as it is the same as my original SKYE LP's. GREG"
2,Poor packaging,"The cable is fine, but it came in a plastic packaging with the ends of the cable so tightly twisted that it never returned to a completely staight position."
3,Good ideas; Needs editorial help,"The book focuses on the evolution of large structures in the universe. Many other topics are included to supplement/support the general theme.The biggest downfalls of the book are the writing and editing. It's hard to believe this is a Cambridge University Press book. There are editorial and typographical mistakes. The writing is often repetitive and, sometimes, disorganized, or at least inconcise. I think that with good editorial help, this book could have been shorter and clearer.The figures are the strongest feature of the book. They appear to be very well thought out and are well executed.I learned things from this book. I guess that's the bottom line."
5,Super cute patterns!,I really liked the patterns in this book. There were several Mary Engelbreit pictures which I hadn't seen before. I also especially liked the fact that there are several suggestions of other projects to do besides just a framed cross-stitch.
3,New World Country Kitsch,"I received this book as a gift because I love almost any form of needlework. This book is geared toward a specific demographic - I would say - and I am just not part of it.The patterns are in color and the instructions and charts are very easy to follow. Most designs are broken down into multiple variations with pictures, and again a repetition of part of the same patterns, which I thought was unnecessary and a waste of page space.The designs are very colorful and portrait a childish nave vibe. Again - the book is not for everyone, but if you like M. Engelbreit designs you will be very pleased with it.To me it is New World Country Kitsch."
4,Beautiful book but....,"This book has beautiful designs in it but they are not what I call easy or even intermediate stage. They do look VERY challenging. While I love the book I have yet to do anything from it. The designs have so many color changes that I think they would be more work than ""enjoyable"" and I do like my cross stich to be enjoyable while doing it."
3,Mary Engelbreit,"As being new to embroidery this book is a little overwhelming to me. I am sure,however, that eventually, with the help of the lady I buy my notions from, I will be able to use some of the designs."
5,"Fire and Ice, an emotional and intellectual experience.","This book at times had me sitting on the edge of an emotional chair. Tanizaki in these tales has managed to communicate every emotion simply but clearly. For me at times it was like looking into a deep crystal clear lake, so clear every detail of the lake, to its bottom was vividly visible. It was quite a different reading experience. Sensuality is combined easily with prudence, and art, making for a simultaneously strong emotional and intellectual experience. I would definitely recommend this book to serious readers."
4,Strange and wonderful?,"The author of The Makioka Sisters, Junichiro Tanizaki, writes seven stories of human relationships. Loving, twisted, but very human relationships. Like most Japanese stories, his focus is on the characters not the plot. The characters tell us tales of horror, beauty and incest. Tradition and history mix with fiction and fetishism, making for interesting yet dark stories that will keep you reading till the last page is turned. Not for children or for adults who are easily upset."
3,Compelling In That Stark And Desolate Japanese Author Way,"This book was a good read with a few compelling plotlines, but I didn't find Tanizaki's style particularly memorable because he so very much resembles Mishima."
3,"Delightful find, barring the DVD errors","I had been meaning to see this for quite some time, as I missed it in the 3 theaters it played in. I'm glad to report that the movie is every bit as charming as I had hoped!I regret to concur with the other reviews that state this DVD is incorrectly labelled as a widescreen release. The copy I rented from Blockbuster said ""widescreen"" on the disc, but was in fact full-screen, with the sides of the frame choppped off.If I can find a widescreen copy, I will definitely buy this."
2,Pass,"Adrian Brody is a good actor, but he isn't given much to work with here. A lot of forced quirkiness in this movie. Very bizarre equivalence worked out between Brody's character and his dummy, and his love interest with her child. Weird. Milo Janovich is probably an acquired taste but you kind of seek a pillow to bury your head in during her scenes. Can't really recommend it."
4,Great DVD Commentary,The commentary portion is a movie by itself. It was refreshing to watch Jeff Dunham and his sidekicks review the movie. I've seen his show in Las Vegas and he is a first class performer.
3,Good Movie..Messed Up DVD,If you're buying this in hopes of enjoying widescreen on your HDTV...don't. Someone messed up and it is presented in full screen with the case labeled incorrectly. I think they even forgot the pan and scan. I hope they correct this and re-release it as it is a good comedy and sure deserves better.
4,Ventriloquism Is Just Funny,"The possibilities seem endless for someone speaking through his dummy at inappropriate times. The idiot parents are fun to watch, as is the punk rock girl from high school and frazzled sister. This is one of those movies where the acting really makes it much better than it ought to be. I think a lot of other movies have tried to copy the tone of this one in the last 10 years."
3,Love Adrien Brody,I really like the actor and see movies that he is in. This is a funny movie with family drama.
1,Dummy,This movie was really slow and boring. I did not like anything about it. Sorry but this movie is no good.
1,Not the right film...??,"Let it be know that the film listed, including the movie description and film photo, does not belong to the the actual item for sale. The storyline shown is for the English film ""Dummy"" with Aaron Johnson. The film being sold is another movie entirely, starring Adrian Brody. Perhaps, this should be sorted out before anymore purchases are made..."
4,ECHOES,"MATT BIANCO IS BACK WITH ANOTHER FINE CD. AS A FAN FOR NEARLY 18 YEARS I KNOW THIS BANDS SOUND QUITE WELL. ECHOES IS CURRENT WITH TODAYS SOUND AND LIKE ALL MATT BIANCO SONGS IT IS REMARKABLY WELL WRITTEN. ANY TRUE MATT BIANCO FAN KNOWS THAT THIS BAND HAS NEVER MADE A BAD RECORDING. IN FACT I LIKE EVERY MATT BIANCO SONG ON EVERY RELEASE. THIS CD IS NO DIFFERENT, AND AS USUALL THE TWO MARKS WILL PLEASE THERE FAN BASE ALL AROUND THE WORLD."
2,"Confusions, misunderstandings and fallacies","This book is a bundle of misrepresentations and misunderstandings. I cannot even understand how bad a philosopher the author must be to confuse teleology/design (final causation) and creation (direct causation). These are quite unidentical concepts that cannot be interchanged. And doesn't he know about the Greek philosophers: most of them believed in design / teleology, althought the concept of creation was unknown to them. I will not cover all the fallacies of the book, but they will be obvious to anyone trained in logic and in avoiding fallacies."
2,Straining to accommodate believers,"I have read the book and I suppose it will help die-hard materialists sleep at night, but frankly why would a true believer want to engage in this discussion at the level he pitches it?"
1,Tower of Babel,"I didn't understand what he was talking about. Didn't he misspell babble? Did I misspell misspell?...Oh! Now I get it. Tower of Babel! I see. He's clever. But, now that I think about it, it doesn't exactly work. Oh well, it doesn't have to -- his field is philosophy."
3,Half-Fundamentalist,"Pennock is to be praised for his defense of the truth of evolution against the attacks of the fundamentalists on science. However his defense his far from being complete as he does not defend evolution in politics. I could forgive him if he was a scientist, but being a philosopher he should have defended evolution in politics against the fundamentalist anti-evolutionary and anti-scientific laws that are leading this country towards a genetic catastroph. I recommend reading books defending evolution against fundamentalism, for example: Why Race matters (by Michael Levin), Mein Kampf, The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration, and the Future of America (by Jared Taylor.)"
2,superficial,"I bought this book expecting to find state of the art arguments supporting evolution and demolishing the opposition. But the arguments are weak and have been made repeatedly by others. Does the author really expect a computer program that supposedly simulates biological evolution to be acceptable evidence? Analogies with linguistics are very poorly explained - I was interested but so little solid information is given.Overall it is a straightforward polemic - the book could have been written in 50 pages, there is nothing new."
3,Feeding The Dog,This story is about a witch named Downing he got married to a witch they had a lot of children and a lot of cats.People thought that the cats were his children.He used his cats to bring him back meat and fish.When they talked about his children he will make them itch and ach.Then this farmer found Downing kids in his farm tormenting his pigs.The farmer killed Downing kids and Downing.Downing made an evil dog.JOSE HERNANDEZ
3,The Price of Protection,"The jury is still out on the effectiveness of this power center, as it has not been put to the test. The unit's LED's do function properly, but the one negative is how snugly it secures onto a wall plate. You can tighten and tighten and tighten the long center screw, but all you will do is distort the face plate behind the unit until it cracks. Your only option is to snug the screw down sufficiently to not allow the power center to dislodge from the face plate when pulling a power cord from said unit. This does, however, leave quite a bit of unstable 'wiggle' in the unit itself; which could, over time, cause warpage or breaking of the wall face plate. This is a design problem which could easily be overcome, I'm sure."
3,Bueno pero...,La parte eléctrica de este conector funciona bien. Se nota la diferencia en el audio. Pero utilizando los conectores RCA no tenía audio. En realidad no se si es que el conector tiene problemas o mi subwoofer (marca Athena) no lo reconoce.
2,Meh...,"I was getting some feedback over my subwoofer, so after trial and error with the manufacturer, we determined it was a power problem. This was supposed to 'clean' the power to reduce interference. This, however, was not the case. It did a little in reducing the buzz, but by no means did it eliminate it. I ended up plugging the sub into my APC power strip and it works fine.If someone just needs surge protection or a minor power interference, I'm sure this would work well for them. In my case, it did not fit the bill"
1,A real monster,"I plugged it in and the surge audible beeper instantly sounded off. I unplugged it and plugged it into a different recepticle with the same result. I called monster and the tech support guy assured me that there had been a surge through my wiring and the SW200 had sacrificed itself to protect my subwoofer, I hung up laughing. I never had a chance to plug the subwoofer in."
1,product faikure,Product failed(beeping) after being plugged in for 30 minutes. I returned product for credit. I am replacing it with the Panamax surge protector.
3,Did not fix the buzz in my subwoofer,"My new polk audio subwoofer has a very low hum when plugged in and not in use. I bought the MP SW 200 WITH CLEAN POWER STAGE to eliminate this hum without paying up for a larger surge protector which i didn't need. However, the hum still exists. Boooo!On the bright side, the surge protector appears to be in functioning condition, so hopefully it will protect my sub."
3,"good protector, bad instructions","good protector, bad instructions with regard to hooking up to the socket, remove the center screw before mounting or risk a short circuit."
1,"Wash, rince, repeat","I don't quite understand the point of a surge protector that has to be discarded after it's tripped? There are so many reasons a circuit might trip other than a dangerous surge, but there's no way to reset the PowerCenter SW 200 once it trips. On the Monster website they tell you to stop using the device and contact your dealer. Why not build it with a replaceable fuse or a reset switch? Sorry Monster this is a fail - not recommending this product."
4,A simple solution for low end subwoofers,"I recently did a very large upgrade to my home theater and changes a number of equipment locations. This ended up causing my subwoofer to not be within distance of any of my UPS's. Being the subwoofer, I didn't needs a UPS anyway, just something to protect it from a power outage. It has worked great for the last couple weeks, I do reccomend just removing the center screw, it doesnt really need that support as long as you press it against the wall when you unplug a device.I do want to comment on the most negative review here, regarding the subwoofer dying. The thing that everyone should realize is that power surges come in many varieties. Surge protectors and UPS's will try to save your equipment by litteraly SACRIFICING themselves but there are limits. High enouph power surges will reach past the protection and destroy the equipment rarely, thats why these devices come with good warranties."
4,Sound investment,"The Monster Cable MP SW 200 Subwoofer PowerCenter SW 200 with Clean Power Stage 1 v2.0 product has a solid name. Most of the time people are uncertain on the proper way to install electrical parts. This is an easy install. The unit provides a rich and deep sound while keeping the bass tight. I have read other reviews and agree it is the best investment that a person can make while keeping to a budget.note: make sure the device does work before installing it. Most of the time we can make an error and wait till later, bad mistake."
2,Interesting To Say The Least,"Item was listed as brand new in original packaging.When received, 2 grommets that are located in each corner of the packaging to keep it secure were missing. The other two were grossly rusted as if it was previously wet, or just very old.Emailed seller who indicated they would ""look around"" to see if they had a replacement. They didn't have a replacement.I asked to have a pre-paid label to return the merchadise.Seller provided an immediate credit and said to keep the item.Hmmmm..."
4,Smart protection for your sub,This thing works and installs great. I have the Monster 5100 as my main surge protection and power cleaning but could not get the sub plugged into it because of distance. This is an easy and effective way to protect your powered subwoofer. Quick install. Just remove center screw from face place. This installs OVER the faceplate. Great that you still have two outlets after you install this. If you cannot get your sub protected by your main surge protector this is an excellent and inexpensive alternative.
4,8-24-68,"Boy, a lot of us were happy when when this first show first was released on cd way back in '92. This was, after all, only the second archive cd release and still a year and a half before the first Dick's Picks. 1968 is one of my favorite years for the band and the sound quality here is very good for the most part. However, Some of the performances on the disc are only a little fair considering what circulates from this era. Schoolgirl is good but there are better versions out there. Dark Star is very young here and doesn't get ""out there"" at this point in time. Saint Stephen picks up up nicely in a hyperdrive way and goes into a good Death Don't Have No Mercy. The main reason to get this release is for the That's It For The Other One->New Potato Caboose which is the best version I've ever heard. Turn On Your Lovelight is okay and is on it's way to turning into the ones in 1969. Morning Dew is good but suffers at the end by having the sound system turned off on the band due to a cerfew."
5,Wayne equals Metal Church & Reverend,"David Wayne, former Metal Curch & Reverend front man, shows on this new release that he's lost none of the range on his pipes. He screaches his heart out on songs like Burning at the Stake and Nightmare Pt.2. This album has everything from catchy hooks to jamming power to even a soul wrenching ballad and sounds more like updated Metal Church than new Metal Church did. Other song titles include Vlad, Hannibal, The Choice, and The Hammer Will Fall. Most highly recommended."
5,The Hammer falls HEAVY!!!,YES!!! This a undoubtedly what METAL is to be. David Wayne and the boyz deliver a great sound with heavy riffs and wicked vocals. \m/....GET THIS ONE! for your METAL collection.
1,Does not work with digital Piano,"It doesn't work with digital piano. When you play piano you need to hit the keys hard which causes the stand and the piano on top of it to shake a LOT, especially when you hit the keys near two ends of it. However, it works fine if you touch the keys VERY gently. So maybe it's good for keyboard. I gave it one star because the description says ""Works with most Casio...electric PIANOS"". That is not true."
1,Very very very unhappy,"We didn't receive and directions or hardware with this keyboard stand,therefore it was just a wast of money."
4,"Great stand, difficult assembly","This stand is very sturdy, well designed, and well made. Unlike some other reviewers, the screws and allen wrench were included. The only part I didn't like were the instructions. They were just a few pictures of the partially and fully assembled stand without instructions. Once I studied the picture on the box for a few minutes I was then able to assemble the stand, after a few incorrect assemblies.Unfortunately this stand does not have mounting screws to attach your keyboard, but that was not a big deal for us at this price. The height is very adjustable, and except for young children, this should work for most."
2,More of the same,"Missing all screws. I know this product is good, but the hassle of getting it all together is the problem. No screws means it is not good. I hope it will all be resolved by the manufacturer or Amazon."
2,Other than shipping the stand appeared sturdy,As with others the stand arrived ready to fall out of the box. If it had contained all the hardware needed it would have been a sturdy stand. I checked all possible hiding places for the missing screws and could not find them. Good luck if you purchase this.
3,"Okay, but leaves you wanting for more...","The instructions are visual ONLY...a fuzzy picture with parts labeled. Very much unlike most times when assembly instructions are much better and detailed. I had to stop in the middle coz I goofed up.The stand itself is fine for the intended purpose...to support an entry level keyboard thats not too heavy. The double-X certainly is a plus.Mine was packed well, but the hardware was still missing a nut...another first time oddity, considering that I have never had the problem of missing hardware. Since this issue has been reported by other folks, something definitely is not right.OVERALL: Not bad as a First stand for 20 bucks."
2,Keyboard stand,"The original keyboard stand was missing a piece and had to be replaced. The directions for assembly are visual, with very few written directions. If you can't follow a fuzzy picture, then you won't be able to assemble this stand."
5,Nice!,I was concerned when I purchased the stand that it wouldn't be very sturdy. I worried for nothing. Stand is perfect for my Casio CTK-720 keyboard.
2,You get what you pay for,"The Good: It is cheap and it is (fairly) functional.The Bad: Does not fit all Casio Keyboards, and does not keep the keyboard securely in place.The Ugly: The instructions are a joke and not at all clear. It ""locks"" into place, and is not easily folded or adjustable. It can be done, but it requires unscrewing and changing bolt positions, it is not the ""folding"" style implied by the picture. There is actually an additional securing beam that does not appear in the picture, that makes the stand more secure, but less convenient for folding and adjusting.For the price, it is sufficient, but this is far from a quality product. And if you have small children or animals that are likely to bump into this, then I suggest finding something more secure."
1,Don't buy this item!,"Why did I think my order would be different? The package arrived with both ends having been retaped,that was my first clue. I opened the package and 2 major pieces were missing and there were no bolts. It was missing all the hardware except the allen wrench. A complete waste of time and effort. Do not order this stand."
1,Is there only one?,Mine showed up in the same condition - ripped on both ends and pieces missing. Maybe the same one is just making the rounds? UPS is supposed to pick up tomorrow. Be on the lookout!
3,Misleading,It seems as if this stand is meant for the casio 110 privia but it is too big-it is a very sturdy stand however-just not meant for this keyboard-bad Amazon.com-anyone else have this problem or does anyone know what stand is meant for the casio 110 privia?
4,"Looks OK, eassy assembly","I bought this stand for my Yamaha PSR275 keyboard. I thought it would fit, but it doesn't.Other than that, it is a nice stand. It's easy to assemble. The screws everybody complained about in previous reviews are threaded into the ends of the legs, so you need to take them out first. I thought they were missing, but in fact they were there.Not the best stand out there, but it's cheap and does the work."
1,Listen to the Reviews!,I had more faith in Amazon than I should have! After reading the bad reviews I still ordered the stand. I got it today WITHOUT ANY SCREWS or plastic grippers. I don't even know what those are!! Now I'm just waiting for Amazon to get back to me email to tell me to send it back. What a drag! I would advise against this product.
1,HORRIBLE,"I just received this item and it's missing not only the screws, but also one of the bars is missing, and there is no instruction book or anything listing what should be in the box. After reading several of the other reviews, I will return this item and get my money back.I would not recommend this item....not a very good track record. Save yourself the hassle and go by a decent stand at Best Buy."
1,Missing parts,The box arrived in good condition except 2 screws were missing so the stand is not too sturdy right now. after reading through all these previous reviews I don't think I would even waste my time try to contact the Casio service department.
1,Not acceptable,They sent me a stand with missing parts and no manual. They then refused to respond to my e-mail addressing the matter.
1,Casio Keyboard Stand,The stand is not sturdy and moves to the extent that it interferes with playing the music. The wooden stand would probably be a better bet.
1,No screws! Arrrgh!,"I thought I'd be luckier than most of the previous reviewers, but no; when my Deluxe Keyboard Stand was delivered, it was missing eight screws and eight grippers, thus making it impossible to assemble. I had to repack it and return it to Amazon. What a waste of time. I also noticed that it is designed so that, when seated, your knees hit the stand legs, making it almost impossible to use (should you ever get all the parts).I have since bought a very strong, properly-designed stand by Kaman in a local store (already assembled). I suggest Amazon stop selling this Casio stand, as all the necessary parts often are not included.Kona"
5,Casio GSDX Deluxe Keyboard Stand,"This was a Great deal. Easy to install and works Great! It is very sturdy and perfect for our Casio keyboard.***The screws are already in place in the stand, when it arrives. You have to unscrew them, then connect it together...It is NOT HARD to figure out! All of these people who complain about the screws not being there...YES THEY ARE...LOOK FOR THEM!!"
4,Terrible documentation,"I am happy with the product.But I had to waste quite a bit of time assembling it simply because of the terrible documentation. First, some of the screws are pre-threaded and they need time to locate. But the main problem was that the legs have to be aligned in a particular way and if only the documentation made that clear, it could have saved me a lot of time."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I guess I should have read the reviews before purchasing. The stand arrived via UPS in very poor condition and the screws were missing. I returned it and another was sent to me from Amazon. The second one arrived in worse condition than the first and again, the screws were missing. Amazon will not send another one, stating ""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however, I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed."" However, several days later, I see that this product is still available for purchase. For the very first time, I am dissatisfied with Amazon.com!"
1,bait and switch,The item's description and picture shows a circular locking mechanism to adjust the stand height. The one sent has a bolt that has to be removed to change the height and then tightened back down with a wrench. I was not a happy camper when I discovered this.
4,Keyboard stand,Got all the screws and went together well. Supports the Casio keyboard well. No complaints.
4,Crappy Instructions,"The instructions were written in engrish (see engrish.com). At first I thought I was missing some screws, but they're actually in the end of the legs already ""for your convenience."" I would've rather had them in a bag instead of thinking they were missing and then having to unscrew them. By examining the picture, I was able to put the thing together correctly the first time, but I could see how some might put it together wrong. Once you find everything and get it put together correctly, it works just fine. I don't have any problems with my knees hitting it. It's very stable if you get the screws connecting the legs in tightly, unfortunately, I had to get a little rubber thingy used to open jars to manage that since the heads of the screws are round and lack screw holes."
2,Be aware of shipping damage via UPS,"I ordered mine but when I got it from UPS, some parts were missing already since both end of the Casio box were damaged, some of the h/w already felt out and could not be found.UPS/Amazon needs to put the Casio stand box inside of another box while shipping, or use lots of extra tape on it.Also, when I went to Amazon's ""return center"", I could not find that item on the list since it was shipped to me already, so I had to send another note to Amazon to see how I can obatin a shipping lable to return that item. I am still waiting to hear back from Amazon.Those are extra work that is not expected. I have been buying from Amazon for many years, I even had wedding registry with them. I was a happy customer until now."
1,Casio GSDX Deluxe Keyboard Stand,Recibi el producto pero tiene un problema con uno de los tornillos de la parte inferior ya que no enrosca.
3,IT DOES COME WITH SCREWS! You just have to look for it!,"For all of you people who complained about missing screws, you are wrong. I also was mad at the fact that I couldn't find the screw bag inside the box at first, however, my friend found the screws to be attached at the bottom of the legs and you just have to unscrew them out of the legs.It is misleading for them to do that because they could easily put the screws in a separate bag but I want to clarify that the stand does come with screws!If you are a girl, I suggest you find a guy friend who is good at installing furnitures to help you to install this stand. The instruction is confusing and for an average girl it is almost impossible to get it right in a short amount of time. But my guy friend managed to install this thing within 30 mins and it works fine with my Casio PX 310.The product is good for its price after all."
3,What were they thinking?,"This product, although it turned out to work alright, caused me to have major doubts even upon receiving it. First of all, I ordered this product new, and payed the ""new"" price of it. Upon arrival though, the box was taped at both ends and was not in good shape. Amazon, I am a dedicated shopper of yours but what were you thinking?Luckily, all of the pieces were there (to my surprise) although you have to really pay attention to the picture on the box in order to put it together correctly. All in all this product has turned out to be a good one, but many obvious factors prevent it from receiving 5 stars. It is not as secure as I thought it would be, but this is only slightly insecure.So, all around, this product receives a three. If I knew I was going to get a used stand though, I simply would have paid for a used stand. My only warning is to be aware of this. Otherwise, this product is a good one."
3,not that strong,I assumed it was really strong because its a double legged one...it's okay...and you cant really adjust it to go low its just has a set height and u could only go up taller but u cant go down...
2,"no hardware, no instructions","I did not purchase this stand from Amazon but experienced the same difficulty with missing hardware. No, I am not unobservant and they were NOT in the legs for my convenience. They were missing in action as were the assembly instructions. Fortunately I live with a skillful metal worker and we were able to assemble this thing. After assembly it was sturdy enough but assembly instructions would have been nice. All in all a disappointing experience."
2,Formulaic PC Tripe,"For this seasoned fan, this season had a few special moments. Very few. I yawned through the entire second disk. I do not want to sound mysogynistic, but this entire season was an exercise in assigning all the strength and intelligence to women, both alien, enemy or ally and assigning all the blunders, ignorance and stupidity to the male characters. The last time I checked, human equality was a relevant cultural goal. If you made the mistake of buying this junk, or can borrow the set, just check nearly every episode. If you want balance and entertainment, forget it; the writing is boring, transparent and palpably annoying. If you're into political correctness and superficial social commentary, you will love it.Yawwwwn. Sigh."
4,The season 4 cliffhanger was a disappointment.,"I love Stargate Atlantis,but the ending of season 4 didn't leave me anticipating season 5.I hope I'm wrong because I love this series.....I'll still watch it(don't get me wrong),but the series seems to be off course.................."
3,"If it isn't broken, it doesn't need to be fixed","First mistake was to get rid of Tori Higginson and the second was to put replace her with Amanda Tapping who was barely around most of the season. Why bring on Amanda who was so good on the original Stargate and not utilize her?Other than that there were some decent episodes but seems that they dropped the whole Replicator/Weir subplot mid season. Why was she not in the finale?If they were going to get rid of any of the cast members, it should have been Ronin who is not only played by an Actor with no emotional range but the character he (tries to play) is just your typical hot head alien modeled after Worf."
1,Non-delivery,Still have not recieved it from the seller. Also have not had any of my e-mails answered.
5,fantasic,"this product atlantis season 4 is great, my whole family enjoyed watching it, the delivery from amazon is faultless, thamks."
1,Disappointed,The show is great but I am reviewing the Amazon Prime service. It times out 4-5x per show and I don't understand why. I though it was an Internet connection issue but my Netflix works just fine from the Wii so I don't know what the issue is. I will have to cancel my service if I Amazon does not fix it.
5,"Always enjoyable, a great escape",Always enjoyable a great escape. Will miss the Stargate universe. When you want something fun and funny to get away from your cares for awhile. The relationship between characters is strong and caring with great comradeship.
4,Still Pretty Good,"Though I did not think season 4 was quite up to par with seasons 1-3, I still thought that it was very good. Though I yet mourn for the removal of Torri Higginson from the title cast, the addition of Amanda Tapping was done with surprising ease. I have always loved the character of Samantha Carter and it was something of a treat to have her, even for a short time, on Atlantis.There were several episodes that I do count among my favorites that do come out of season 4 (Trio, Doppleganger and The Last Man being among them) and I did enjoy the progressive character development that continued through the season, though not quite as much as we had seen previously."
5,SGA Season 4,super season it just takes to long to get the next one. But I guess this what the company wants. :-)I can recommend this season.
5,Love this show!,Great show and even better when you get to watch it again and again. We loved Stargate and Stargate Atlantis. Big Fans!
3,Stargate Atlantis - The Complete Fourth Season,I love Stargate Atlantis but Fourth Season I have to give it a B-. Something is missing(?).
3,Jumped the Shark?,Im sorry I LOVE u SGA but this last season was not up to the high level that was set. The best ep was a direct ripoff of momento!
5,Best Season of Atlantis yet!,Season 4 was an incredible season for storyline. The opening episodes set the tone for the whole season. The first half of Season 4 offer some of the best done episodes of either Stargate series and the mid-season 3 part episode is incredible. The return of a beloved friend with a very emotional scene expands Michael's storyline dramatically. The finale is very unique to any season of Stargate. Well done on all fronts!
2,trio,THIS EPISODE OF STARGATE ATLANTIS SEEMS TO BE A FILLER EPISODE. IT DID NOT PROGRESS THE THEME OF THE SERIES ANYWHERE. I WONDER IF THE EPISODE IS VICTIM OF THE WRITER STRIKE.
5,Stargate = win,"I'm a huge fan of Stargate SG-1. When I heard of SG Atlantis, I was a bit skeptical, but over the seasons this show has become one of my favorites. Season 4 is just as good as the rest. Definitely a must buy for any Stargate fan."
4,"Good, but....","It was good, and exciting.... Still, would rather have seen sg-1 season 11.I'm not sure that the plot twists and turns are what they used to be, definatly not those of a Heroes or even Doctor who.Still, very enjoyable, escapest fun!"
3,Its an OK buy,"This book has lots of great information in it. You can easily learn a great deal about 3D graphics and what it takes to create an engine. However, one of the major drawbacks is that the engine doesn't compile. Which, in my luck, has been typical of computer book. But reading the books for the concepts are great."
1,"I'm sorry, but the CD ""Companion"" is inexcusable","The CD mistakes are unforgiveable. I would say until they release a completed downloadable examples of entirely workable examples DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!I did visit the errata site and followed a few of their examples on how to build things. Got a couple of things to build, but when exploring the world in the example of chapter 15, there are bugs and holes in the display or render errors or something. Or maybe this is the way that it was engineered.I think when they provide proper support for this book I will probably give this book 4 stars, because I think it is well written and goes over the topic of Game Engine programming very well. Too bad they did such a poor job of quality control."
1,THe author should learn how to program first!,"C'mon - at least get a CD with examples that actually compile! If he were a programmer working for me, he'd get fired. Save your money, and you can buy mine as used for 1/2 price."
3,"OK, but still needs work","The book does provide a basis for understanding a 3d game engine but it leaves out pieces in its tutorials, which would fine execpt that the book is written in ""step-by-step tutorial"" style. If you actually follow the book as a tutorial and code along, nothing will compile. If you use your head a little, though, you can figure out the missing features on your own, either by reviewing the material on the cd or by googleing. All in all, I found the book to be OK but i am still looking for someting better."

4,A photo album of the night sky,"This was a great idea-- a book of photographic maps covering the entire sky. I purchased my copy from another website for much less than it was sold here.The book could have been improved if it had closeup maps enlarging parts of the sky which contain many objects-- even individual constellations such as Cygnus, Orion, Sagitarius, and Virgo, which contain many galaxies, clusters, and other objects of interest to the observer. The wide field photos simply can't show everything of what the sky has to offer.Still, this is a unique atlas and deserves a place in every amateur astronomer's library. It is the perhaps the only photographic atlas now available which shows many of the stars visible to the naked eye and in binoculars."
2,italian charm,The charm is very pretty in person. This is the third on all of different birthstones that I have purchased and 2 of the 3 has already lost stones. This one in particular lost a stone withing 2 weeks.
4,morph pump,"i gave this pump a 4 because i have not had it long enough to test its durability and i think the foot stand is flimsy....But over all this pump is great...dosent take long to fill a tire, the hose makes it a lot easyer to pump being that you dont have to hold the pump and bike wheel to keep a good seal whyll pumping.... and then of course the presure gage is sweet so you can hit the right presure every time.....i say get it"
3,Gauge never worked.,Presser gauge never worked. Pump works nice and fits onto bike great. Just have to use another device for air check. Get one without the gauge.
5,Works Good,"I ordered this pump to carry on the bike in case of a road flat or to top off the air pressure while out riding. I have only used it once and it seemed to do what it was supposed to do: air up tires to 100psi. I have Presta valve stems and all worked well. The foot peg, pump handle, and air gage are very nice additions."
5,Love it for years,"I love this pump for years, since 2008. It is lightweighted, reliable and really works great. I would recommend this to any of my friends."
5,Wish I bought this years ago,"I'm never buying another pump that doesn't have the features this pump has - gauge, foot stand, and a short hose. So much easier to pump to 100 psi."
2,"Middling performance, irksome design flaws","Foremost, I smack the beegeebus out of my knuckles when I use this thing. It really ought to stop the stroke high enough that someone with normal-sized hands doesn't have this hassle. (seriously, my glove size is M across the board). I end up having to forgo the flip-out handle feature and move my hand in-line with the barrel. Also, I have some minor issues with this chuck grabbing valve stems, but it eventually gets there and doesn't leak or let go once it does. The flip-out cleat is not locking, doesn't really brace the unit, and is generally worthless. The gauge (almost requisite for road tire psi) is helpful and accurate.I wish I had bought a Lezyne. If it were not because I use frame pumps so infrequently, I would."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Product, Worst Documentation","Like the title says, it is:a. A good idea to have a morph pump with a pressure gauge.b. A poor implementation because the gauge is pretty useless (i) highly inaccurate (ii) usable range is cramped because gauge goes all the way to 160 psi (iii) highly inacuratec. No mention anywhere how to convert pump between Presta and Schrader. I had to watch a youtube video uploaded by a good Samaritan that showed process of dismantling the value and inverting the rubber busing and the plastic air channeler. Topeak SUCKS.2 Stars because pump will get the job done"
5,Topeak Turbo Morph G rules...,"This thing works exactly as advertised. Having a ""floor pump"" out on the trail is a beautiful thing. It fills a 26"" tube in no time and you don't have to be crouched in an uncomfortable position thanks to the hose and flip out foot. The gauge could be graduated in lower/smaller increments for us mountain bikers, but for as well as it functions, I won't complain. I recommend this pump to anyone who will listen."
1,Aggravation,Well packaged is about all I can say for this - it came in a nice box.You can use both type of valve on this pump but it's a pretty tricky set up. I ended up letting my tyres down more than getting them pumped up the first few times and had to borrow someone else's pump!It's a pretty weak piece of plastic that comes with no instructions.Do youself a favour and go to a bike shop so you can check what you're buying.
4,"Lightweight, compact pump","This is an excellent, very light weight, and practical pump. The pump and the guage work very well. My only reason to give four stars is that the instructions to change from and to Presta valve are not clear."
5,The album of 1980's,"I will put it simply: this is by far the best pop album of (at least) the 1980's at all fronts. Many may disagree, many may doubt it, but that's all they can do about it. It's just a fact. TFF is not my no. 1 band (they were at a time), but this one even beats Simple Minds' Street Fighting Years and Michael Jackson's Thriller. A stunning musical achievement. A masterpiece. A must have. Go for it."
3,Just What I Ordered!,I have loved Tear for Fears for so long!!! I wish they would come to So Cal for a concert!
3,Well Orchestrated But a Bit Overblown....,"This was the 3rd album from Tears For Fears, it followed the tremendously successful ""Songs From the Big Chair"". I liked the song ""Woman In Chains"" but this album was quite a departure from the last two by TFF. Although this CD is technically well constructed and shows off the group's musical talent, I was not very moved by it."
2,Not as good as Songs from the Big Chair,"Except for the Year of the knife, and Sowing the Seeds of Love, this album is at best mediocure. Extremely disappointing when considering how good Songs from the Big Chair is."
5,Best ever from original TFF!,"I purchased this CD when it first came out ten years ago and still cannot quit listening to it. I became a TFF fan about the same time all other die-hard fans did, back in 1985. This is one of my ""desert island"" CD's and I will never grow tired of it. Badman's Song is probably the best song ever done by TFF. I recently saw the import version that has the bonus tracks and I plan to get that in the future. Whether or not Roland & Curt work together again, and they probably will not from all accounts, they can always be proud of this one, although one can see & hear that Roland was firmly in control at this stage. I like Roland's ""solo"" TFF work but always come back to this one. This CD also brought Nicky Holland's talent to the front and of course, Oleta Adams too. I only hope Roland gets something to us real soon because I'm going into TFF withdrawal."
4,Not as good as their previous two albums but still good.,"When I first heard this cd, I was slightly disappointed. Their sound is quite different than on "" Songs from the Big Chair"", but if you like Roland Orzabal in general, you'll still be pleased with this. It's much mellower and not as depressing as the other albums that came out before this one. Just don't expect something sounding similar to the older Tears for Fears that came out with "" Shout"" and "" Everybody wants to rule the world"". This is nothing like it but Rolands angelic voice has never sounded better and "" Sowing the seeds of love"" is a great song along with most of the others on this cd."
5,TFF Brings in Oleta Adams,"""The Seeds of Love"" is TFF's ""Sargent Pepper"" It's an excellent jazzy sounding recording where TFF brings in Oleta Adams out of a night club. Oleta was quite appreciative with the duo as she later won a Grammy for her solo release. She brought a soulful and bluesy sound to ""The Seeds of Love"". Highlights:Woman in Chains- Feminist's tune on their struggles. Excellent!!Badman Song- Oleta at her jazzy best.Swords and Knives- Typical TFF tune.Year the Knife- A little edgy tune.The recordings of ""The Seeds of Love"" are smooth and crisp as more real instruments were brought in versus a using an electronic synthesizer as a base for their recordings. I thought this was their 3rd best release to end a phenomenal decade."
2,"sound good, cd player made noise when cd playing","The cd player made a very loud whirring noise when it was playing the cd. If the volumn was up loud enough you could not hear it, but at low volumn levels it was a very loud noise.We called the company who said it was not suppose to do that, so we returned to Amazon for refund as it was out of stock and they could not ship another."
5,Gift,This was a gift for my Mom who lives in a small apartment anddid not have the room for a BIG Stero system-she is very happy with it.
1,Disappointed,"Emerson boomboxI bought this as a Christmas gift. When opened later and tried out - the CD player did not work. Of course, this was past Amazon's 30 day return policy so I only received 10.00 on my gift. I will certainly not buy any electronics from Amazon again. What an unhappy Chistmas gift!"
2,"Emerson AM/FM radio, cassett and CD player",I was satisfied with the condition of this product but not with the quality of the emerson name. I find that the range of volume is not loud enough to even fill my classroom with sound and that the CD player makes a lot of excess noise while the disc is spinning therefore when trying to do a listening lesson some students are distracted by the extra noise. I am not extremely satisfied with the product and if you are looking for a quality CD player please look elsewhere.
1,"one day it was fine, the next day is was dead!!!","Honestly, the thing looked rather cheap, especially the cassette component, which I never got to use before the whole box ""broke"". I used the radio & CD player on occasions over a couple of months. It was playing decent quality for the most part. But a few times the CD player would randomly skip from the middle of one song to the end of the disc. This happened on multiple CDs that are without scratches or prints. Anyway, next thing I knew, 2 days after it just played without problem, I couldn't turn the sound on. The blue light would turn on, but no display of radio station or CD track AND NO SOUND! Of course this happened right on the dot past the 90-day warranty from Emerson. I tried troubleshooting with different CDs, outlets, adjusting volume and radio station, NADA! UGH! There's my $35 wasted!"
1,Disappointing,"This product left my hair more silky, but that wasn't what I was after. Since I have baby fine, thin hair, I was hoping for more body. I bought it based on the positive reviews. With shipping fees, it was bit pricy for only 4 ounces of conditioner, but would have been worth it if it had added body and fullness as advertised. Ah, well, the search goes on!"
5,A brilliant articles on diffrent sort of gemstones. A must f,"I WOULD LIKE TO THANK CALLY HALL PERSONALY FOR SUCH A EXCELLENT WORK ON GEMSTONES. THE WORK CANNOT BE DESCRIBED IN WORDS. I AM A JEWELLER AS WELL AS GEMOLOGIST, GOT QUIET IMPRESSED WITH SUCH PIECE OF ART."
3,Gemstone Identification,"This book is OK but for the beginner trying to get the most for your money in explanation of precious gemstones, I don't really recommend this book a necessity for right away. You can enter it to your reference library at a later time. It is a good book but doesn't have enough details needed at first for identifications."
2,missing pages,"I new this was a used book and I expected damage. What I didnt expect was 20 missing pages. Important pages. I contacted the seller, and got no response. I didnt even ask for my money back. I think it would have been good business wise to maybe offer a store credit? An apology? Will go to a different seller in the future."
2,A witnessing tool,"This is an adequate display of the truth of Christianity to be used for witnessing. However, it leaves too much room for many dangers within the church, but only because it does not address these issues."
1,"""Marita"" Missing Everything","The book is an all too personal, unverifiable account of child custody situation that might be interesting if the reader were related to the principals involved. It is of zero interest to anyone interested in the Mormon Church, Mexico, or even child custody situations. Embarassingly boring and puerile; don't waste the money on someone's wannabe attempt at authoring a book. I threw mine away."
3,Is it really worth it?,I bought this becuase of the hype..Clean power equals better picture and sound. Sales guys say it does make a difference--real world answer for me at least is that I could not differentiate between my cheapie $15 surge protector and this Monster Cable PowerCenter. I dont think I would buy this again. Probably go with a cheaper version next time.
4,Great bang for the buck,I bought this to go with the new plasma and blu-ray player I bought because I felt like I had to do something to protect my investment. Amazon was selling this for about half the price anywhere else was. I hooked it all up for piece of mind and for a goof even ran the coax cable through it. To my surprise it actually cleaned up the picture enough to make a noticeable difference.Very happy with it.
4,Quite a complete power distribution/protection center,"This power center has a series of plugs, each labeled with the device it feeds, and ample surge protection. it hangs nicely on the wall and organizes the power cable connections. It seems to be a well thought out and executed product. The one thing that irritates me a bit is how bright the power light is. It's alway on and can be a little distracting when you're watching the TV."
5,Just plugged it in...works wonders.,"Simply awesome surge protector. My surround sound system used to hum every so often due to unstable power. I isolated the problem: the cable line! After connecting all my A/V equipment to this surge protector, I still heard the hum. I was devastated, but monster ships a coax cable and an ethernet cable along with the unit. I rewired my cable box so that the cable-in line was now going through the surge protector and the cable-out from SP to cable box. Not a single hum, I even notice quit standbys as well. (I used to hear high frequency noise coming from my TV on standby, now it is gone!) Wonderful product, did more than I expected. I'll re-post if this thing has to face some severe weather. Only issue is, I could not find this model in black...oh well. It is hidden from view anyway, thanks to the super easy wall mounting bracket."
4,Works as expected,That power button is surprisingly bright in a dark room. Previous reviews were right about finger room on the RCA connectors. Glad it was a one time thing. I mainly bought this guy for its power filter capabilities. I do know that its the average surges in the homes and apartments that overtime damage flat panel TV's. I hope I never have to use it as a lightning protector.
4,Good for price,"This has been a good addition to my home theater setup. Lots of well placed outlets and I like the style of it. I am not sure of any picture improvement since I bought it when I bought everything else in the setup, but everything is fine and I am very glad I bought this item. Good for the price also."
4,its GREAT!,"It is an awesome product, with very ease of use. Not to mention to extremely fast shipping from Puget Sound. I ordered on Tuesday 11/09/2010 and received this product yesterday 11/12/2010!"
5,Monster Cable,I love the cable. It is exactly as I had expected and the great reviews helped me decide to get this product.
4,"Good product, no problems thus far.","The product works as indicated. Bought it more as a precaution than anything, really. Number of plugs and markings are very clear and accessible.Main complaint is that the hanging mechanism is very poor. I have mine hanging to the back of my entertainment system and it keeps falling off of the mount it comes with.Other than that, no problems so far!"
1,Defective & seller refused to do anything about it...,"I bought this when I moved into a bigger place, knowing what all I would need to be plugging into it. It had just enough plugs/surge protection for what I needed. But one of the end accessory plugs was defective straight out of the packaging because the internal contacts were not lined up correctly so it's impossible to plug anything in to that slot. I contacted the seller and they said I'd have to get Monster to replace it. Poor customer service. I definitely wont be dealing with this seller again, or with Monster products due to how over-rated AND over-priced their products are."
2,Buzzing Noise,"It seems like a nice product, but when I plug it in, there is a high pitched buzzing noise. It is quite loud. Will be sending it back and hopefully a replacement will perform better."
4,Very good,"I like this book. It has some minor editing errors and the examples are not that great. The notation can be a bit confusing at time. Overall, however, it is a very good book for someone new to number theory or with limited understanding of it. It is also a good refresher course."
3,clumpy to pour,"I've been using this product for several years, and this is the 1st time I've purchased from this seller. This bottle was difficult to shake out, as it seemed to be clumped together. Since I""ve never had this problem before, I can only assume that maybe it had sat around for a long time."
3,Typical,"Extremely mellow and predictable, but would we really want Dave to release a death metal or fusion disc? Good guitar playing... average songwriting. Not something to play over and over but worth a listen and not as horrid as some claim."
4,Gilmour's Finest,"I never look to a solo album hoping it to sound like Pink Floyd. That's a mistake to do so. Howerver, I hear snipets of Floyd in this fine, fine album. I hear Fat Old Sun, I hear Echoes, and Obscured by Clouds. But yet, I hear pure Dave Gilmour. I think it's the finest of all solo albums and I am a HUGE Waters fan. It's defnitely mellow but beautiful. The guitar work is magical. His voice clear and methodical. It's the type of music you put your headphones on and drown out the world. Calm yourself, and enjoy the sounds, the smells and the memories that will appear in your mind and ""Take a deep breath now."" ; )"
1,A surprising DUD from a musical genius!!,"I guess I have been spoiled since the early 70's when my admiration for Pink Floyd blossomed. To me, they could do now wrong..........I really loved all of their albums, especially Dark Side of The Moon, but who didn't go nuts over that one?!?! This CD by David Gilmour is way too mellow and no track really grabbed me and made me want to listen to it over and over again. However, I would HIGHLY recommend that all of you Pink Floyd fans go out and buy the DVD ""Pulse"", which is a live concert taped in 1994. It is nothing short of spectacular! Better yet, have Santa put it under the tree!!"
1,"To many ""party nights"" gone by for David","This DVD is beyond lame; on loan to me no way did I buy itSame as Live 8 reunion, that had to be the worst off all time get together ever, from any band. Notice in that how Roger dressed and made up his hair, as to not make David look any worse then he does, it didn't help, just brought it all out even more.In the Flesh DVD rules, like this cant even come close to it, not. DB II on guitar stole that showPompeii DVD smokes good, guess there is no substitute for youth"
1,Please don't waste your money,"I'm a big PF fan, actually liked some of the Gilmour solo stuff, but this CD is VERY BAD. I have no words to describe how bad it is.Please don't waste your money."
2,Boring,"I typically like this kind of guitar sound and production, but this record just doesn't blow my skirt up. I find it uninteresting and I'm surprised it has so many good reviews. The sound is laid-back and yet it feels like it's trying too hard to be atmospheric, and it never really lets go. There are some nice songs here, some duds, and a bunch of stuff in the middle. Perhaps I'll like it in twenty years, but for now there's plenty of other great stuff to listen to instead."
2,a reply to brad king,"I've been a Floyd fan since a saucerful of secrets, and I can't help being offended by this person who calls himself a Floyd fan.You claim David Gilmour never wrote any songs for Pink Floyd.All you have to do is look at some of the record sleeves.Or maybe you downloaded all of these albums.Ever heard of comfortably numb?Also, I believe once Roger left it became apparent what David brought to the sound of Pink Floyd.In my opinion they both were essential to the overall music.Anyway, to me this doesn't compare to either his last solo album which was excellent or the division bell, which had many good songs on it."
2,New Age Snoozefest....Zzzzzzzzz,"After 2 wonderful solo albums, this is the best David can come up with in 20 years?! It contain's David's superb guitar soloing over incredibly forgetable tunes. If this CD had anybody else's name on it, it would be in the cut out bin quick. Make sure you hear the whole thing before deciding to buy it. I'm sure this will be very popular in Leasure World communities. I give it 2 stars worth of credit ONLY because of the solos. For fanatics ONLY."
2,Wish You Were Here,"Well, I've always had a deep respect, and I mean that most sincerely. But, nothing on this CD grabs me. Nothing on this CD makes me want to drag a friend home to hear this music or discover its allure. It's flat. I don't understand the lyrics. I really am disappointed.I have been a Floyd and Gilmour fan from the beginning. My wife as well. We just looked at each other in dismay as we listened to this the first time. I don't doubt that my copy will gather dust on a bottom shelf somewhere. Sorry.I give it 2 stars for production quality and packaging. Have a cigar...."
2,Below Average Effort From a Guitar Legend,"I'm probably the biggest David Gilmour fan I know and I had such high hopes (pardon the pun) for his newest solo album. I'm sorry to say that I was severely let down. Aside from ""Take a Breath"" and ""The Blue"", this album is no more than mediocre at best. David Gilmour is certainly showing his age now, trying to appeal to people closer to his own age and never truly ""rocks"" like he did with ""Until We Sleep"", or ""All Lovers Are Deranged"" just to name a few. While his guitar work is truly magnificent on this album, the lyrical effort is a glaring reminder that he should have made ammends with Roger Waters years ago. Gilmour's wife writes the lyrics on this album and once again begs the question ""how on earth can you call yourself a poet?"" If you're a hardcore Gilmour fanatic like I am, buy it but don't expect much. If not, stick with ""About Face"" or his self-titled album."
2,A Disappointing Retread,"David Gilmour's new album is a waste of great talent. From a textural standpoint, this is all retread of Division Bell, which was a retread of Momentary Lapse of Reason. Don't get me wrong Dave, I thought ""Reason"" was a great album, but it's almost twenty years later and time to experiment with some new sounds.I would kill to be able to play guitar like Gilmour, but he really needs to stretch out into some new directions. For a more interesting blend of old and new, try any of the last few Jeff Beck discs."
4,Still Brilliant,"Many people will be familiar with the relaxed, zen state that can infuse a listener when listening to some of the classic Pink Floyd tracks. Those that enjoyed that sensation will be pleased by David Gilmour's suitably named offering 'On An Island'.Even many years after the split of Floyd, Gilmour still puts together quality music with consumate ease. Opening with the classic, howling, solitary guitar in 'Castellorizon', before moving on to the wailing sax of 'Red Sky At Night' that will remind seasoned listeners of a fusion of 'Wish You Were Here' and 'Ummagumma'. 'This Heaven' has a more gruff, jazz house feel and wrenches the album away from it's more mellowed out tones before dropping it gently back down into 'Then I Close My Eyes'.It will be heartening for fans after so many years, that much of the original magic still remains. Many fans were disappointed with some of the final Floyd offerings. Maybe there is something here that was missing from their last releases."
2,Just Not Very Good,"If you worship David Gilmour from the Floyd days you will no doubt find a way to like and praise this CD.If you don't, well, I'd be very surprised if you find it to be much better than background music that you don't have to or want to pay attention to. The many glowing reviews simply baffle me.I say this as a big Gilmour fan. The second star is no doubt my bias coming through."
2,So Disappointed,"I cannot seem to get into this music. It's boring, not at all like Pink Floyd. I guess it's good for helping one to fall asleep."
3,The Easy Listening Version of Pink Floyd,"Put the CD on, go run a warm bath, burn some incense, and slip into a New Age induced coma. You get all the PF licks & hooks without any mental challenge. Gillmore is anywhere but on Island, he is sitting right on the white line in the middle of the road."
2,Weak,"I'll be brief. The CD opens OK, ""Island"" is very good. But that's about the end of the nice things to say. The third track is unlistenable. Pure fluff. The rest of the album is background music. Like outtakes from 'Division Bell' or 'Momentary..' I am a Floyd fan, and like David Gilmour's first two albums. But his song writing skills are weak. Nothing on the par with Roger Waters'. The songs on this album go no-where. ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"" and ""Interstellar Overdrive"" where melodic songs as well, but they evolved and the music took you along for the ride. 'On an Island' is mood music. Not recommended!!"
2,Just didn't do it for me,"Just a little too laid back. I got to listen to the whole CD on AOL's ""Full CD Listening Party"". Good thing. I would have bought this CD without hearing a note. I love David Gilmour, but there's very little here that isn't strictly light weight fluff. Very nice light weight fluff, but fluff just the same. I'll just go to iTunes and spend 99 to buy track #4, ""Take a Breath"". It's the only track that remotely resembles Pink Floyd or features the meaty guitar work that I love so much about David Gilmour. I would recommend his first solo album, but I just didn't find enough on ""On An Island"" to warrant a purchase."
2,Not worth the wait,"David Gilmour is undoubtedly a great musician and his years fronting for Pink Floyd have secured his position as one of rock's great guitarists. While I wanted this to be a great album, it simply is a let down; not because it doesn't sound like Floyd, but because it doesn't have one good song on the entire album. David's new vision, represented here on ""Island"", has truly worked to polarize him. The music here cannot possibly engage any listener and move them in the way that his sound has in the past."
5,A very well made album which will leave you comfortably numb,On an island is a very well made album from the master himself.This is as good as about face though a bit slower than the last floyd classic The division Bell.I have listen to it probably a hundred times and enjoyed it.Highly recommended.
3,Pink Floyd Lite?,"Gilmour's voice is clear as ever and it's just about impossible to NOT hear past Pink Floyd music in this CD. Shine On You Crazy Diamond comes to mind. But it's Pink Floyd Lite for sure. That familiar whine and wail of Gilmour's guitar is there, so the PF fan may not miss that. It's a good listen, even if it's an easy listen. Brings back memories of days gone by. Glad I got this puppy on sale.51 minutes, definitely worth a listen."
2,What a snoozer,"I like Gilmour and after reading other reviews here, bought the album.Yeah, the sound quality is excellent. But....The tunes here are absolutely forgettable. I've listened to the album several times and there are no cuts I really need to hear again. Pleasant, boring background music.Get Dave's first solo album. It's light years better."
5,Top Notch Album,This has the quality you'd expect from the former leader of Pink Floyd. Worth every single dollar.
4,SALE IS UNLAWFUL?????????,CD Plays perfectly. packaging was perfect. delivery was prompt.But on the back of the CD is a sticker stating:FOR PROMOTION ONLYOWNERSHIP RESERVED BY SONYSALE IS UNLAWFULORAW 34 S1gosh i hope i dont have Sony green berets bashing down my door to get this back!!!!
2,Not the best,"Had this record a week or so and I would say that dispite my 2 star rating there are a couple of tracks I quite like. But this album is far from a great work. I think the truth is Gilmour is a superb performer and improvisor but a lousy composer of structured works. I would rate Richard Wright's compositional skill significantly higher, he wrote some beautiful bits on Dark side and Animals. Ultimately I think its a crying shame that Gilmour and Waters can no longer work together. I cannot image how good Amused to death would have been if it had been given the Gilmour treatment. That's basically how pink floyd worked on golden albums like Animals, waters comes up with a demo tape and the thing evolved into greatness using the other band members considerable talents. For me the closest to something like Animals is a Roger waters solo album, Amused to death."
2,Good background music,"This album is not what I expected as a long time fan of David Gilmour/Pink Floyd. I understand his approach and intention wasn't the same as his previous solo albums. For me, it took alot of temptation not to skip any of the tracks in the hope of finding a song that will rise above the rest. I would have hoped to at least have one decent song on this album. I have to admit; David still has a wonderful voice and is a awesome guitar player. However, I wished that I did not rely on his past success in order for me to buy this album. I recommend previewing the tracks before purchasing so you won't be disappointed."
5,Good CD,"This CD was a gift to my dad who is a huge Pink Floyd fan so I haven't been able to listen to the whole CD, but from what I've heard it is a good CD. I was surprised when it arrived because it came long before tue estimated delivery date. I would totally recommend this CD to those who enjoy listening to Pink Floyd but are skeptical of a solo performance by one of their members! Those who aren't familiar with Pink Floyd (shame on you!) will like this CD as well!"
4,The Dreamy and Dark Side of Pink Floyd,"I think this CD is reminiscent of Dark Side of the Moon. Gilmour's voice is dreamy and soft, but in this way you can really hear what a good voice he has. There does not seem to be that almost violent passionate voice present in Delicate Sound of Thunder and Momentary Lapse of Reason and in parts of The Wall. I think it also has a mix of The Division Bell. However there is a quiet passion present in these wonderful lyrics and music. It is a comfortable place, listening to this album, something wonderful to sleep to and have wonderful dreams. As Gilmour himself said: He is showing ""emotional honesty"" in this album."
4,Far from boring.,"I've listened to this twice and my first impression is this: it's one of the best solo pink floyd albums to date. Like many have said before, it is pretty mellow and sounds very similar to meddle in a lot of respects. That is definately not a bad thing! I'm guessing it will be to the people who think Pink Floyd is solely dark side of the moon and wish you were here. Great guitar solos and excellent vocals .. overall 4 and a half stars."
1,Waste of Money.,"Pink Floyd has been my favorite band for as long as I can remember, and when Roger left, that was the end of Pink Floyd. As bad as David's self titled first album and follow up About Face Albums were, I would give them 5 stars compared to this. I would even give Momentary Lapse of Reason and Divison Bell, which were both awful, 5 stars compared to this. I can't believe he is actually charging people for this. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have. Unless your a die hard Gilmour Fan (NOT Pink Floyd Fan), don't waste your money."
5,This album is superb pallies!,"David Gilmour can still come up with great musical riffs which was something that the dumbkuff Roger Waters[...] couldn't do. On an Island, whilst slower in pace than his last two solo records. My standouts here are the title cut, This Heaven, Where We Start and Take a Breath. To say that Bratananey Sneers would write better lyrics than Polly is like saying Ashlee Simpson is better than Neil Peart at lyrics California Coool a/k/a Slip and Slide. You are a k-nucklehead for degrading this. Buy now or HEEGOTCHA!"
2,ZZZZZZZZZ...zZZZzzzzz...,"Couldn't wait to get home yesterday and listen to my new Gilmour CD. I won't bore you or myself with long overdraw comments and analogies of the disk. Look at my stars and know that I agree with others that posted the same scale.Basically, the first 5 songs are tollerable. The rest... I'm still confused about? Actually, upon further review, the word BORING describes the entire CD best. The Guitar solos almost take off ... maybe the solo in Blue is innovative, but the rest of them stay grounded. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!"
1,"Oh, dear!","If I were alone on a desert island with this album, I wouldn't stay long. Signed, a David Gilmour fan."
4,the blue,"I really like this CD, The Blue is my favorite song, the guitar in it gave me goose bumps and brought tears to my eyes, so pure, so clean, so lovely. It's a shame the whole CD wasn't filled with that kind of guitar."
4,Intensely Soothing,"This is the perfect album to listen to while staring at the sea. Gilmour sounds as majestic as ever. Listening to tracks ""Blue"" and ""On an Island"" are delightfully brilliant.Have been listening to it non-stop since I purchased it over a month ago. David Gilmour never ceases to amaze."
4,Finally a CD for folks who have been buying vintage vinyl,"...Rather than write some trite trash I'll just quote William Obscured, who seems to have said it all most sublimly.....""The album holds fast to the sound of the days we all remembered, and have certainly by now almost forgotten on our way back along the path to the music we love. Now add the masterful amalgamator's talent to meld music that Gilmour has indeed for pushing the envelope - here is the new album ready for your next journey."" ...P.S. Thanks David,Harry K"
3,"Different from what I expected, but interesting","Very quiet album, few good guitar solo. David has still a crystal voice, very relaxing to listen to. It is not a Pink Floyd album, so don't expect it to sound like a Floyd album from the 70's.This cd is different from what I was expecting, but I have to say that after few listenings, I like it, good for relaxing !"
2,"If I was alone on an island with only this cd, I might like it","Neat packaging (a mini book; reminds me of Pearl Jam's ""Vitalogy""), but the music, well, don't expect any Pink Floyd flashbacks (think Pink Floyd on valium instead of acid or even a clear head). I do respect Gilmour's greatness, but I just didn't care for this cd. I gave it a real shot, too, but it's too slow and introverted. You can sense his sincerity throughout, but I couldn't relate or get excited about it. It obviously has suited many people favorably, just not myself very much."
2,David Gilmore fell asleep during 2nd half of recording session,Listen to 1st couple of tracks will make you think this is probably as close as you can get for 'shine on you crazy diamond' or 'dark side of the moon' era pink floyd music...but rest of the tracks are just 'fillers'....what a lame effort to imitate albums made 30 yrs ago except his occassional signature guitar solo......
5,"This is as great as the wall,the dark side and the division bell","I want to tell people that on an island is as good as the above mentioned pink floyd classics and to remind everyone that DAVID GILMOUR WAS ALWAYS THE REAL DEAL,NOT ROGER WATERS.Please ignore the nutcase reviewer named COOOOOL DUDE and purchase this excellent cd for your collection.ADIOS FRIENDS."
2,A weak effort typical of the post-Waters Floyd,"On An Island is basically a continuation of the mediocrity that was A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Both were de facto Gilmour solo albums and both had 1 or 2 good songs on each with just a bunch of filler for the rest. On An Island is basically the same. The title track is decent, as is the Island Jam that isn't actually part of the album but the vast majority of the rest of the stuff is boring filler. And just because a song is slow doesn't mean it's boring. Compare ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" and you'll see the difference. Basically if this wasn't David Gilmour, nobody would care and this would be quickly forgotten. The man can play music well but has trouble coming up with good music on his own that isn't written by other people, like Waters for most of the Floyd stuff, his co-collaborators on Momentary Lapse of Reason or his wife on Division Bell and this album."
2,Boring album.,"I'm a huge Floyd fan. I don't like ""Momentary"" that much, but the songs from that album played live on ""Delicate Sound of thunder"" are excellent. ""Bell"" was definitely better than ""Momentary"". I wanted to point that out to let the people reading this review know where I'm coming from, and if they have similar tastes, let them know that this album is not for them. Great production, great solos, but overall slow and boring. Of course there are good songs (""The Blue"" comes to mind), but come on! I want to stay awake! Too many pointless instrumentals and too few songs (just ONE) that pick up the pace. If you MUST have it- OK. I can't stop you. Just don't listen to it while you're driving."
5,Good David Gilmour,Good David Gilmour here. Outstanding in fact! I like what Gilmour brought to PF and ON AN ISLAND distinctly has that sound. Great CD cover too!
3,Mellow,"Do not expect Pink Floyd here. I'm not going to go crazy on this review other than to say that if you like David Gilmour on vocals and like the more mellow side of Pink Floyd than you will like this. And this is probably Gilmour showing his age now and reflecting on things a bit as is evident on this release. I would have to say one song sounds like Pink Floyd, but everything else is Gilmour and there is some great guitar work here also. The one criticism I would have is that it's too short for such a long wait between his last solo outing and The Division Bell'. I'm sure he has more in the closet and it would have been nice to hear it here."
4,Not bad....but nothing special,"This is basically a 3.5 star CD.....it could have came out in 1975 instead of 2005 (or 2006, whatever) and you wouldn't have been able to tell the difference....that's not necessarily a terrible thing.....it's just that this CD is nothing significant or earth-shattering.....Gilmour could put out a CD like this every year if he desired...."
2,Too choppy and too many distractions,"As with the rest of my fellow die hard Floyd/Gilmour fans, I was expecting great things from this album. I even set aside an evening to listen to it for the first time through my Sennheiser HD280 pro headphones in order to get the most listening pleasure.About ten minutes into the album I found it to be somewhat choppy and difficult to listen to. David's guitar on ""On An Island"" and ""The Blue"" was classic Gilmour, but I soon felt like I was forcing myself to listen to the rest of the CD. The bells, whistles and other assorted mixes of noises was a big distraction.I have listened to it several times since then, and it is beginning to grow on me somewhat, although very slowly.For Floyd/Gilmour fans expecting to be totally blown away by this album, I doubt it will happen, at least the first time you spin it up.I'll put it away for a few months and then give it another listen. Who knows, maybe I'll fall in love with it. Or not.Shine On You Crazy Diamond..."
5,a great masterpiece,I would rate On an Island to be on par with the Division Bell and About Face his sophomore release.This album is excellent right from the first track till the end.Dont miss out on this one.Disregard the haters and get this today.RECOMMENDED.
4,Mr Gilmour and his writings,I think this is a very good album because he has chilled out. I can listen to this without a care in the world. If you like Floyd or Dave's first album you will love this. I like his DVD so this is a follow on from that. Well done Dave!
4,Laid Back,"A very laid back, cool, guitar driven album from David Gilmour. It does lack some of the magic that he did with Pink Floyd, but there's still a good deal of interesting stuff, here."
4,Aging like a fine wine,"David has given us something special. There is no doubt that after 18 years from his last solo album and nothing since the last Floyd Album (93) we have had a major dead spell by anyone from Floyd.Well Dave is an older man and his talents have only aged like a fine wine. Sure he doesn't have rockin' out tunes like you find from the 70's but more an element of the age of all his works. This is a mellow album with the licks of his unmistakable and original guitar works. This is very much like a Floyd album without being one and if you are a fan of his or Pink Floyd, you will enjoy this. 20 years from now, you will uncork that bottle and enjoy it just as much..this is a timeless piece."
5,Gilmour's got it.,"David Gilmour proves he can still put together an meaningful record. His voice is mesmerizing and his guitar work is everything a Gilmour or Pink fan is looking for. While David Gilmour will always be in the shadow of his former works, he has proved with ""On An Island"", that he can stand alone and cast a few shadows all by himself."
1,Unforgivably dull.,"A huge disappointment after such a long wait. Mostly leaden ballads, the songs are deeply uninspiring and repetitive while the lyrics, mainly written by Gilmour's wife, Polly Samson, are trite and seem designed simply to give her husband something to sing. Gilmour seems strangely reluctant to show off his guitar prowess on most of the tracks, which struggle to get underway. Take A Breath is a positive embarrassment and the worst thing the maestro has ever done. I didn't expect a new Floyd album but surely we deserve something better than this. Far and away the best offering is the brooding, 6-minute Island Jam given away with the album by Best Buy as a promotional CD. I suggest you pay the earth for this one outstanding track and try to forget the album."
2,Are you suprised??,"Quite simply no one from Pink Floyd has had a successful solo career. I didn't expect this latest release from David to be anything better than his previous solo albums or Rodger's, or Nick's or Richard's.The simple fact is when the four of these guys were together as Pink Floyd that is when they shined.So why keep releasing solo albums? Probably to fight of boredom. It can't be for money cause they are already setup for life.Despite which member of Pink Floyd who you believe to be the heart and soul, none of the solo albums they have released compare to what the four of them created together as Pink Floyd."
2,He's lost it.,Let's be honest here people. This album is not cool. boring soppy ballads with all the lyrics written by gilmour's wife? WHAT ON EARTH HAS HAPPENED TO THIS GUY!?!?It's like music to be played at a funeral.
1,"BORING RECORDS, GOOD FOR ""ELEVATOR MUSIC GENRE""","Only one comment: ""C'mon, gimme a break..."".Uninspiring, 0 stars."
2,Really major league disappointed,"After buying the single first, I couldn't wait for this to come out. Literally counted the days. Really disappointed. Major bummer. Lots of this feels like rambling new age ez listening stuff. Some pieces hardly sound like a song, but just some sort of idea that DG should have kept working on. I will be seeing the Radio City show in a few weeks and am just bumming how let down I feel right now."
2,I woke up to write this after being knocked out by Sir Gilmour!,"WOW!, This album is magnificently boring and highly uneventful.I don't know what else to say besides that it has all been done before and in a much better way. I find it hard to believe that someone out there can enjoy the two uptempo songs ""Take a Breath"" and ""This Heaven"". Similar thoughts are expressed regarding the remainder of this narcotic. Regarding his guitar playing... read the second sentence above. Melodies are also unmemorable.I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and consider David Gilmour to be my favorite guitarist but maybe it's finally time that he retire if these are going to be the results of his labor.This disc should come with a warning label informing the consumer to not operate machinery while under the influence of ""On An Island""."
2,contemplating his navel,"This is the kind of music that I think should be performed at home, in the dark, with complete privacy. It is self-reflective, ambiguous, non-melodic, and boring. E for effort but no thanks. David Gilmour has a wonderful voice, but this album doesn't reflect anything but noodling."
3,I live on an Island,"and it does not sound like that. Gilmore's Island is in his head and feelings with No Soul, premeditated to the Core. This recording is All Floyd since Pebble, in a blender with too much time on his side. It does not Fly like the seaguls in his drawings. Maybe next time around ( where do we go from here ? )"
3,not too shabby!,"I just picked this album up as an impulse buy today. i expected it to be terrible, but i was wildly impressed. it sounds more like Pink Floyd than the last 2 Pink Floyd albums did. sounds very mid-seventies. nice, simple production. beautiful, rolling songs, and Gilmour's unmistakable guitar presence."
2,Too Consistently Peaceful and Quiet,"Like many David Gilmour fans, I bought this CD with great expectations. I listened to it through twice in the hope that I'd missed something, but I fear that I didn't. The voice is still like honey, and the guitar work remains exceptional. But the whole album is like a whisper . . . hypnotic and soothing . . . with neither a wail nor a roar. No one can begrudge David if this is where he is in life. But part of what made his whispers in the past so powerful was the thunder that often preceded and followed them. And on ""On An Island"" there's not a cloud in the sky."
3,I can see the evolution,"Clearly, a dedicated Floyd fan sees all the transitions the band had, from leaving the 60's psychodelics of Piper to that 80s snafu, Momentary - right down to the silly ""Knight-Rider-esq"" electronic drums. This album has some Meddle and Division Bell aromas. I think Meddle was by far the best they ever did. DG digs in to that a little. He typically has his super-crunchy strat over Marshall sounding style. And he uses a slide to get those screechingly high and spooky notes. The first track almost sounds like what Clapton did in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. But, given his (their) history, this seems like an appropriate follow up."
4,"No new surprises, but Gilmour's distinctive groove is easy to get caught up in","David Gilmour's 2006 solo effort ON AN ISLAND picks up right where Pink Floyd left off with their final album THE DIVISION BELL. Gilmour's distinctive, soaring guitar sound is matched to his laid-back, somewhat hushed vocals, singing lyrics by his wife Polly Samson. It's mostly an ambient event, and even when the guitar is at its most active, the backing tends to be samples or Dick Parry's cool saxophone; rarely does a vigorous rhythm section appear.Gilmour doesn't really strike out into new territory here, but his talents are considerable enough and his sound is individual enough that one more album from him is a welcome and entertaining event. I see there's some complaints about the lyrics, which are indeed twee, but this album generally works by setting a chillout mood and I at least and never drawn to pay attention to the exact words."
3,Over the Hill,"I am a long time Gilmour, Waters and Pink Floyd fan, but have to say this is a weak album. Sounds too much like an attempt to sound like Pink Floyd. Not unlike Divison Bell or the MLOR. Waters can succeed without Gilmour, but Gilmour always falls short in his attempts. They both need each other to be great again. I have trouble listening to this album all the way through. Couple of good songs, but definitely no classics here."
1,One half-assed good song and that's it...,"One song I recognized from his concert dvd....not bad, mellow, has a melody....The rest is all crap....no structure, no lyrics, no lead guitar, no beat, no angst....Yuck. Unfortunately, I bought this unheard, and I will never do it again.If I think back, however, his solo efforts have always tended to suck, and venture into the wierd, in an inane effort to distinguish the work from that of Pink Floyd.I feel cheated. And I'm a huge huge fan. I've been waiting for YEARS for this."
1,"I cant tell song 1 from 10- Snoozer, Horrible, What a letdown!","I have listened to Pink Floyd probably once a week since 1974. It is in my will they will play DArk side of the Moon at my wake! I cry at times I am so overwhelmed with the music. This album makes me cry for a different reason. It has no life, its old, its boring, its repitious. I feel old having to listen to this. It has no heart, no juice. I literally cant listen to more than 1/2 a song before I change to another CD. The David Gilmour Live Concert DVD. I guess its his and Pink Floyds final hurrah!"
1,Totally disappointing,"I'm not sure why David Gilmour decided to waste his time on something so incredibly bland. Every song sounds the same, same slow mediocre melody, no energy, no creativity. The sad thing is that this might be good for a fading star like David Crosgy but this is David Gilmour. He is so much better than your average rock artist, so much more creative, lyrically as well as musically. What was he doing at the piano, sleeping? That's my only guess as to why this album turned out to be so monotone."
2,Couldn't hold my attention,I knew that this was not going to be Pink Floyd but I didn't expect it to be downright boring.
2,Unrewarding,"When that fat old sun [Gilmour] in the sky is falling...Quite frankly, I expected more. My feeling is that David Gilmour really has nothing to say in this album. Not only the lyrics, but the music itself is mediocre. At most, maybe one or two tracks (""Take a Breath"" and ""This Heaven"") are acceptable (by no means great!). I went back and listened again to ""About Face"" - it seems so much more interesting. Ditto for ""A momentary Lapse of Reason"" and ""The Division Bell"". I think these lyrics from ""The Wall"" are quite appropriate for Gilmour now:There must be some mistakeI didnt mean to let themTake away my soul.Am I too old, is it too late?Where has the feeling gone?Will I remember the songs?The show must go on.I'm asking all the reviewers who rated this album highly: would you still buy it if it were released by a totally unknown artist? I wouldn't."
2,"Ho Hum, We Want FLOYD","Ok, this album does have its moments. Unfortunately they are far and between the rest of the Sleepy-time stuff. I do like the older feel, like Obscured and Meddle, but it misses the mark lyrically and playfully. I guess I was hoping for some kick ass guitar work here. Even the solo's seem predictable and bland. To wait this long for a solo effort and get such a laid back effort tells me he has hung up his gloves. It is a sad day for us all.All I can do is ask for Dave to give us one last grand moment and get back with Roger and the boys. Your fans have bought your album, now return the favor and get The Floyd back together. Please! It's not to late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around."
1,Frightful,"This CD reminds me of the line from ""This is Spinal Tap"" - something like: ""the musical growth of this band cannot even be charted."" I have reflected in other reviews how refreshing it is when an artist is not caught up with the need to progress and change, but continues to make the good music that made them successful in the first place. In Gilmour's case, however, the lack of progression is fatal. ""On an Island"" sounds like the second half of Gilmour's first solo album. The fact that almost 20 years separates the two efforts is dismal testament to Gilmour's lack of creativity.Now, I'll be the first to agree that Gilmour is a marvelous guitarist - his phrasings are without peer, and his versatility is incredible, particularly his ability to alternate tremelo & vibrato.But left to his own devices, or without a template to copy, Gilmour creates the most forgettable, empty music that could be imagined. ""On an Island"" is where this CD should be played - some unpopulated island that is."
3,Very Good,"Very well written CD but you need to be in a very mellow mood to listen to it. The instrumental songs are great and the guitar work at the end of ""The Blue"" is awesome. There is a cool bluesy sound in ""This Heaven"". I always thought that one of the downfalls of About Face was that as soon as the guitar started jamming the song would fade out. He doesn't short change you on this CD, but it is something you listen to when you want to really relax."
4,Satisfying solo outing by Pink Floyd guitar hero,"David Gilmour has no careerist reasons to make records any more; he makes music because he wants to. The odd thing about this recording is that although it has a star-studded cast of helping hands (incl. Phil Manzanera, Crosby and Stills, Georgie Fame, and Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright), it sounds very intimate, a pure expression of Gilmour's personal happiness. As one might expect, it's very Floydian (think Meddle-era) but about as far removed from Roger Waters' paranoia as one could get. People who require a high testosterone content to their CDs might get bored with the peaceful, contented soundscapes here, but for those of us who need a sonic oasis in the midst of a gangsta-rap desert planet, this is heaven."
5,we are old but not passed the dark side,this is great gilmore stuff. he was a kid when he joined pf. but this is mature music. the addition of crosby and nash shows hat he can extend his muse. thanks cc
2,Elevator Music,"This album will put Sominex and night-time Nyquil out of business. It's elevator music-meets dental office. A big disappointment. I'm a fan of Floyd (both with and without R.Waters), have been looking forward to this album for some time, and it seems the anticipation was greater than the event. I'm just glad I didn't pay top dollar to see Gilmour in concert if this is what he's going to play. My recommendation is Gilmour fans buy his awesome DVD album from a few years back. It's a live show featuring old floyd songs, some random new stuff, and some tunes I never heard of, but all of which are very enjoyable. On An Island...well, it should have been left there."
4,NOT,"These works lyrically are not that of a 20 year old in this century, nor should they be. Gilmore is NOT 20 years old. When a old dude is still writing youthful themes what you get is the Beach Boys still singing ""Be true to your school."" The word to describe the is pathetic.Some of the negative reviews are from the old Waters vs Gilmore fight. Gilmore is seen as less a lyricist than Waters.Yet, Waters has been writing the same theme over and over since the Wall. He has never matured over the tragedies of his life caused by WWII. Gilmore is NOT Waters and appears not to have had a central theme in his life and/or music.Gilmore lyrics are NOT contemporary. He is NOT MC Gilmore! If you want simple rhyming lyrics I suggest most Rap.What we have is a solid piece of work from a classic musician.That's fine with me."
3,What makes good music?,"Music = vision + lyrical content + melodic content + mood. Roger Waters brought tremendous lyrical content and vision to PF. David Gilmour brought melodic content and mood to their music. Roger Waters is right for criticizing post-Waters PF albums as 'hollow'. David Gilmour is right for calling 'The Wall' and 'The Final Cut' as verbose.Compare 'On an Island' and 'The Final Cut' for a good lesson in how each of these talented musicians contributed. This album has 4 great songs: 'On an Island','This Heaven','The Blue' and 'Smile' that are complete. The rest as many say, are lazy/meandering/relaxed, maybe hollow ideas that could've used Roger Waters. Just as a lot of songs on 'The Wall' and 'The Final Cut' could've used more Gilmour. Enjoy this for what it is: a 60 year old who is finally performing stuff _he_ likes."
2,perhaps i need to listen to this album a little more....,"Ok, so i read the reviews figured it can't be bad, after all I have always liked Dave's guitar playing, but after listening to it a 3-4 times I am still not sure what its appeal is. Some of the tracks are really great, I am sucker for a swooping guitar, but others are awful. One reviewer raves about Polly's songwriting skills however the Division Bell really stunk. Sorry Dave but maybe it's me that is not ready for the album. Two out of 5 for the couple of songs that do shine. Thanks for the great memories though (by the way, which one's pink?)"
2,"I LOVE YOU DAVE, BUT BUY BROKEN CHINA TOO!","Hey, everybody, go buy Broken China, NOW, by Rick Wright, 1996. See my review there. As to this one, well,Man... What a bust!First an overture. Cool! We're gonna get a symphony, four movements. We're gonna go on a trip... by the fifth cut I had landed in Candy Cane Land.Sorry, man. I think everyone who has a collection going will want this, and it's got some incredible hot points, but it's a bit too into the shuffleboard... with a textbook shuffle sound.Just a bit of virtuoso on the drums would have helped.Cool. It's your statement. I can abide that. I'm gonna go and see you in London. But it's not one which will be remembered 200 years from now.All the best,Steve In Spain"
3,Watered down Floyd,"Well, it's not a bad album of music, but after listening to it about three or four times, I found it getting less and less interesting with every listen, instead of the other way around. I love David Gilmour's style of guitar playing, but this is not the best thing he's done. Still and all, it's worth a listen. Buy it used and save some $."
2,Bad Sound,"The brother of Django Rheinhardt, Joseph, would play solos at those gigs Django forgot to show up for. When Django did show up then Joe played rhythm. This recording of Joseph, made in the early 60's, show that he was quite a good soloist. Unfortunately, the guitar he is using is an acoustic archtop mounted with what can only be described as the worst sounding pick-up in the world. It sounds as if he was playing from inside a metal trashcan. It is a pity that he didn't use a better guitar, for his playing is quite good. One bright spot is that the rhythm guitar accompanying him sounds very good. What an irony!"
3,Nice addition but better modern tango out there..,"Noteworthy vocals but instrumentals leave something to be desired.. overall, not bad but there's a few other better buys"
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is not what you're thinking. This DVD is merely two hours of the ""flamboyant"" John Patitucci playing songs. He does not show any of his riffs to you, he plays them at full speed so it takes forever to find the pattern. This is $30.00 I'll never have back!"
3,Way Too Sweet for Me!,"I am a jam connoisseur and I have to say that this is the most sugary jam I have ever tasted in my life. Also, when I bought the jam, I thought it would be packed with luscious fruit, but the whole top third of the jar was like jelly! It was totally clear with no friut at all. I gave it to my mother and she said it was way too sweet for her as well.[...]"

3,ok,"I like all of the other dr kracker's I have tried, but this one is a bit too sweet for my taste. I think the agave should be left out or lessened in the ingredients. Otherwise, similar to other dr kracker's in texture, etc."
5,Delish!,"The Dr. Kracker Seedlander Flatbread crackers are the BEST crackers of any, hands down. I've tried several of the Dr. Kracker flatbreads, and none come close to this one. In fact, far as I'm concerned, they're better than ANY other cracker, nutritious or not!!!"
2,Potential tooth damage!,Purchased but did not like the hard ( not crunchy) texture.Not going to risk tooth damage for my familyj
2,either stale or not so tasty,"my guess is these are stale, because i've had different flavors before and they were delicious. these are suitable for teething babies. Even if they weren't stale, they sent me 6 packages with expiration dates two months from now. who can eat that many crackers that fast? not worth returning due to shipping, maybe i can make bread crumbs out of them...."
4,Nice and crunchy,"Not your usual thin, fragile cracker. Very substantial. Crisp, crunchy, and very flavorful. Sweeter than expected."
5,An addictive flatbread,"We first bought this in a store in Vermont, and were pleased to find that it is available by the case. Every time we serve this to a guest, they want to know where to buy it. It is tasty and healthy and you just can't get enough. Maybe its the poppies?"
3,Great taste but stale,"I love these Krackers, but Amazon cannot seem to prevent near expired product from leaving their dock. This is the third time I've gotten these krackers days before the expiration date. Following a complaint, Amazon sent a replacement that had the same, now expired, expiration date! They refunded my cost--good on them.Hard, crunchy, packed with seeds, this kracker has a nice sweetness from the molasses and splet. Excellent kracker and if you like a kracker with substance, try these out. BTW, the individual krackers are large, 3 1/2 X 5 inches big."
4,A good Foundation,"I picked up this book to help me get started on my quest to upgrade my MCSE. I like the way that the authors explain the concepts behind the new features incorporated in Windows 2000. I thought that the chapters on RAS and Active Directory were especially good.The only negative was that RIS was not covered as thoroughly as I would have liked, but overall the book is must buy for anyone that is trying to get up to speed on W2K."
2,BORING,"If your idea of ""photographic wisdom"" is listening in on a couple of old farts pontificating and patting each other on the back while talking of days gone by and photos taken ages ago, then this book is for you...In summary, the book says:1. Take lots of pictures - you must practice your art just like any other.2. Compositional rules are for people who need them3. Street photographers have to engage their subjects to get really good shots.That's about it..."
3,long wait,"i thought this item was set up if you purchase in so many hours you get in a few days. it took over 30 days to receive!! i was going to about contact seller and bamo, my transaction came through and received dvd in the mail. it was a gift and thought it would come in before christmas!"
3,Just Say Yes,I've seen the movie but haven't bought it yet.At this point I just want to share it with friends who could use a good laugh. For you liberals looking for some hard hitting political message listen to Thom Hartman or The Young Turks. For those of you on the right who are offended by anything involving sex or corporate hypocrisy just turn to Fox News for your daily dose of lies. For the rest of us seeking a good laugh this isn't a bad way to spend 82 minutes. I don't think you can compare it to Hunt For Red October so buy it used and cheap.. but buy it.
1,No Impact!,These people just go too far with scatological imagery. There are few people who could view this DVD without being repulsed by their tasteless and vulgar presentation.Just tone it down and make it more acceptable to the average person and perhaps they can get their much needed message across.Hard to watch or to take seriously...
3,"Overall OK, but not hard hitting.","If you have read ""America: The Book"" by Jon Stewart, that has comparable humor to this. Also similiar to Micheal Moore's pseudo documentaries. With that said, if you liked either of the above mentioned prouducts, you will probably get a few laughs out of this movie. 3.5 stars."
5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST BIOGRAPHY,"I have been a HUGE fan of Univrsal Horror since I was a small child. I am more a fan of Dwight Frye. He has for a long time been considered the more neglected actor of Universal Horror, after I have read all the books that contain facts about him,seen all the card sets of him,and seen all the the movies, I think he has earned his way into being considered one of the big name actors. This great biography tells all about this great man and his now famous carear."
5,Dwight Frye's Last Laugh,"Very interesting reading, I enjoyed this book so much, because I have always been interested in Dwight Frye as an actor , but didn't know where to turn for information on him....Lucky me, I found this great book on the internet....I have read it over and over and make many references to the book along with the movies it covers... This book is about a great character actor..Must Have..."
3,Good for 10 and up,"What I wouldn't give for this book to teach my child to use a tuner to tune a guitar...I bought this for my sons to share, aged 7 and 10... the 7 year old is completely lost but my 10 year old seems to be able to pick up what is written. Do NOT expect most children to be able to teach themselves from this book... mom or dad will have to help out. It is also a VERY thin book, I would have liked a little more to it, still it's a good starting place."
1,Delivery very slow,"I purchased this on 01/29/10 and it is now March 3, 2010 and I have not received the book yet. I have not been notified that it has been shipped but when I check the status it shows it is in transit. It has been in transit for over a month. I purchased these to teach my grandkids and would like to receive them. I would give a better review if I had the books.Delivery is horrible and I would suggest not purchasing from this store."
4,My girlfriend loves hers!,"My girlfriend couldn't be more excited that I found her a pink coffee mug. It seals real well, and the insulation is great. It is too tall for her cup holder, but at least it doesn't spill when it falls over.One major warning: Don't put this in the dishwasher, or let it ""soak"" in hot water. Just fill with warm soapy water and sponge clean the outside. Otherwise, the air seal around the mug sucks in the water and holds onto it when you go to fill it with hot coffee. Then the water all squirts out on your counter.Honestly, if it wasn't pink, I would steal this from my girlfriend when she wasn't looking. There is a blue and red one out there for $5-$7 more."
4,Nice mug,"This is a very nice mug. I do have a few minor issues with it. 1) Even though I handwash the mug and do not leave it soaking, it still seems take some water into the insulation section, which sometimes drips on me as I drink. 2) I often overfill the mug (and sip out the overfill) prior to putting the lid on. However, the overfill seems to stay on the lip (between the mug and the lid), and also drips on me. This issue might be tied to point 1."
3,breast cancer mug review,"This is the best mug I've ever had, insulation and non-leakage wise. The problem is, it's made to be in a cupholder. I am a breast cancer survivor, and have problems with my hands due to lymphedema and neuropathy. This mugs tips over way too easily because it's tall and top heavy. I'd like to see the mug shorter with a large bottom, so it can be used around the house without spilling it all the time."
1,disappointing,"The lid on this mug is definitely spill-proof, but unless you want to hold the mug upright for about 10 seconds to get a full sip of coffee, you should not buy this mug. It worked fine for the first few times I used it, but I think maybe the hot coffee melted some of the plastic on the lid? When slid to ""open"" the coffee barely drips out now. Trudeau's idea was to have a lid that could be sipped from all sides, but I would prefer one big opening over these miniscule ones."
1,Leaks,It is top heavy and moves around in the car's cup holder. It leaks from the lid while drinking. I threw mine away.
2,Not so great,"It's a really nice-looking mug and it keeps beverages hot for at least an hour or so... but the top does not open enough to get a decent sip. I've had Trudeau mugs before (with their special top) that have been great, but this one- not so much. I don't know if they changed the top (my last one was pretty old) or if this particular top isn't made correctly, but it takes forever for a small sip to trickle out."
4,good quality,"My mom is a breast cancer survivor so Im always searching the web for awareness items, she also loves coffee. This mug is very sturdy and she also liked the fact that you can drink from any angle. Since she drinks her coffee while driving to work on the expressway she doesnt like to have to look down and find the opening in the lid."
2,Trudeau travel mug,"This is a pretty mug--but disappointing. Fore some reason your beverage only dribbles out of the opening. This quite frustrating. No matter how you turn the top to 'open' the flow, you don't get a normal mouthful of liquid. I don't recommend it."
2,Capable Of More Than This,"Tony McPhee is a great blues guitarist; and on this 1997 release he pays homage to one of his influences, Howlin' Wolf. Problem is the performances here do little in the way of enhancing or re-interpretting this great material. McPhee is a guy who is capable of so much more, both in terms of purely playing the blues and composing his own material. This release is even recorded in a very generic, lifeless fashion. To make things worse, he released a similar album of Muddy Waters covers two years later that is stuck in this same mode. C'mon Tony, write some new songs and produce albums the way you used to."
1,Does Scott Bennett do yoga?,I'm sure Scott is quite talented musically but really - the first two tracks could not possibly be background music for a yoga session. I feel ripped off!! Gaiam should be ashamed of supporting this product.
4,Darkness at it's Best,"This is really an excellent buy for anyone interested in Dark music.The DVD feautures High quality Videos by acts such as IN Flames,Theatre of Tragedy,Amorphis,The 69 Eyes and Crematory.The real surprise on this DVD is the Theatre of Tragedy track called Machine,A brand new style.This DVD is well compiled and the Video selections are really of a very high quality.Except for the Girls Under Glass video which is a bit low budget.This is tentalizing viewing for lovers of Dark Music.The Likes of Crematory with an excellent video will confirm my Statement.Just a pity that a video of HIM wasn't included to be enjoyed in digital dolby sound.Still a great compilation.If it's too loud you're too old!"
2,Lost in Translation,"I believe there must be a great deal of Irish cultural subtext here. Even as an American of Irish descent, much of this was lost on me.There were far too many loose ends.Instead, I recommend ""Into the West"" and ""Millions""."
1,Don't Bother,"I'm with Christine on this one. My wife and I checked this out from Blockbuster based on the pr paragraph on the reverse side, indicating three souls would come to ""healing of hearts and minds,"" which we did not see happen in our opinion. I could not understand half of the dialog. I don't want to give it away for those willing to waste 90 minutes. Rent something else."
2,I really don't understand this movie,"I bought this movie because it was recommended in a flier that I get from a nationwide christian book store. I like purchasing Christian films just to see what is out there. This movie is just confusing. There are alot of irish sayings that add to the movie; however, I just don't get them. Also from what I understand, one of the main characters dies in the movie, and the little boy believes there is a sign from heaven that the man went to see God. However, the man was never saved so I did not quite get this. The movie really does not provide an ending for the main character. Also the movie had a few curse words in it. If I am not mistaken, one teenager said f--k in the movie. He was fussed at for using this word; however, a christian movie dropping a f-bomb is really not my favorite thing to watch. I mean there were only like two curse words in the movie; however, the movie really does not make a good enough point to me to make it worth those two words."
1,Explain this,"Totally confused by this movie. Explain it to me, what happened at theend? Did the boy die? it sure left you hanging.Don't waste your time."
1,The acting and direction REALLY are bad,"I wasn't expecting much going into this - stumbled across it on Netflix and wanted something light and fluffly. But wow, the acting, direction, and even the songs are really, really, bad. Not just bad - REALLY bad. It was almost too hard to watch."
1,Amazingly Bad Acting - Could Not Watch More than 10 mins,This movie is about as corny as it gets. The acting is superbly bad. The script is so full of holes it actually becomes laughable. For $3.99 we felt pretty sad that we wasted our money on something this dumb. I have no idea how these greats reviews were posted. Perhaps they were done by youngsters who idealizes the dream of becoming famous. Take my word for it! Search on. Don't waste your money on this movie.
2,Elle: A modern Cinderlla Tale,This was an ok movie. Only gave it two stars. About girl who works for her uncle who owns a record company. She dreams about becoming a singer and eventually realizes her dreams when she wins a audtion.
2,Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale,"Have not actually sat down to watch this with full attention, just turned it on to make sure it was not scratched and listened with half an ear, but from what I heard, I am glad I did not pay full price for it. Was a very poor retake on a great fairy tale."
5,Great Product,"This product is amazing. I was constantly embarrassed by my extremely foul odor. After one dose of this product I was odor free. It certainly does what it claims to do.I had tried other products such as Gas-X, Beano which did absolutely nothing for me. I feel that I got my life back because of this product."
1,No noticeable change.,"I experience what is called leaky gut, and it is when you smell like feces all the time. This product did not help me with that."
4,Classic Omar...Enough Said,"As this is the third of his CDs I've added to my collection, it showcases his talent even in the early 90's. Now if he can only get a decent record deal that would actively market his music in the U.S. Amazon needs to give him a little more respect too by listing the tracks like normal artists. I guess this is further indication that folks still haven't discovered this talented artist. As an early Omar album, it signifies musical growth. Not quite as edgy as ""For Pleasure"" or ""Best by far"" but very melodic and relaxing. Music is my favorite track especially with the street-corner acappella harmony in the intro. Of the 11 tracks, only 3 didn't get repeated play (Tracks 3, 7, & 9). Lyrically and musically, the songs are good. But as another reviewer said, ""His rhythms and arrangements can be too complex for some to understand."""
2,boring,"The subject matter and price was right, but it was by far the most boring thing I have ever contimplated showing my ninth-grade English students. For example, the video contains still video shots from the eighties or seventies of Orwell's home complete with the current owners cars in the driveway. I would only show this to my kids if they neeeded extreme punishment, or if I had to be out for a two week period during our Orwell unit b/c of a family tragedy."
1,Not Impressed,With this being a Audubon product I expected it be nice and well built. I was way off with my expectations when I opened the box the first thing I thought was the 39.99 I paid was way to high. This product was poorly built and compared to others of similar size and better construction at my local hardware store(Lowes) was only $10.
5,"I love it, BUT... You gotta have a place to put it!","This is a very well built and attractive bluebird house, and I'm sure placed in the proper place it would serve its purpose well. But there's a BUT. Unless you are familiar with attracting bluebirds, don't buy this until you've read up on the subject. These work best when placed near the edge of large clearings - not necessarily in your back yard. Unless your backyard faces a golf course, or you live in the country with open fields, you'll not attract bluebirds. Sparrows yes. Bluebirds require space, so read up on them first. Amazon has some excellent books dealing with bluebirds, and I recommend you check them out before buying this excellent birdhouse."
4,"Very nice, but no bluebirds","This is a lovely little nesting box. Copper top is very nice.However, there is no guarantee of bluebirds choosing it. (We currently have sparrows)Don't worry about opening the door, nest material stays in place."
5,Bluebirds love it,"On the very first day we put this lovely birdhouse up in North Florida, bluebirds found it and checked it out. That is especially impressive because while we have plenty of blue jays here, bluebirds are seen much less often."
3,Life lessons from someone who's learned the hard way,"Written in a casual, chatty style, this book sets forth the life lessons the author has learned, often the hard way. Books of this type often end up sounding like sermons, but this one remains more conversational. At the risk of oversimplifying, the most important lessons seem to be about being true to yourself, and about trying to always look for the good in the world. The author illustrates her points with examples from her own life, but notes that everyone is unique, so we each have to discover our own specifics. There certainly was a great deal of food for thought here, and even though I'm definitely not the target demographic for this book, I still found much of it worth thinking about."
4,"indeed, under rated","It makes me angry how late Dead albums and this album are hated so much. Poor sound quality my a**. The songs are great. Maybe they do sound a little tired, but most of the Deads music isnt fast paced and speedy. He's gone, and Mississippi half step are two of the highlights, to me, on this album. But i dont think ive ever heard a jumpy version of those songs. Worst dead release ever? Wow, you guys are really Grateful, arent you?! I laugh when I hear people judge a band like the Grateful Dead so harsh. All of the fame was put on them, they never asked for it, they didnt try and look pretty, and sound like music from the heavens above. they had fun and jammed. it aint supposed to be pretty.if you get confused, listen to the music play."
2,Truly the worst live album released by the Dead,"Lackluster sound, a setlist comprised of 1st set material, ie no extended improvisations usually found in the second set and while the playing is good, it's nothing special. But the worst thing about this album is the way it sounds. Every bit of energy the band might have put into these songs is sucked dry by the lifeless and flat mix/recording. Considering the wealth of superior live material the Dead have released in the Dick's Picks and From the Vault series, Steal Your Face can safely be passed by. There really is nothing to recommend this album either for the Dead fan or newbie. Neither the song list or the playing are that interesting and the sound stinks. You aren't missing anything. The Dead themselves considered this to be a subpar album. Phil Lesh going so far as to say it was the worst live album they ever released. Skip it."
1,Phil probably just has good memories from this tour.,I agree with the previous reviewer.This is a horrible album.Why they released it I'll never know.Nobody in the band seems to have it on this one.The music and the vocals just sound tired and un-enthused.Not a shining example of the Dead's live shows.
1,The Worst Grateful Dead Album,"Other than the great logo on the cover of this album, this is by far the worst live album by the Grateful Dead. The sound quality is terrible. There are no long jams that the Grateful Dead are known and loved for. The song selection is peculiar, at best. Any other live Grateful Dead album trumps this one. Buyers beware. This album should have been called, ""Steal Your Money""."
1,Ask for your face back!,"This album never should have seen the light of day. If you're trying to turn on a friend to the Dead, nothing will turn him/her off more than this mess. Most of the Dead bootlegs I've collected have better sound quality than ""Steal Your Face."" Which is too bad, since, underneath the muffled, muddy tracks, you get hints of performances that must have sounded great at Winterland. The ""Wall of Sound"" PA system (which was retired after these Winterland shows) was capable of incredibly clear delivery, even at very high volume. The only good thing about this album is the cover -- probably the most enduring of the Dead's logos."
2,Not quite right,"If you listen carefully to this cd you shall find out that this is not a real concert recording. Original recordings from Chavela's previous albums have been put together on this cd, adding audience sounds in order to make the impression of a concert. If you disagree with my point of view you should: first, listen carefully to the public's sounds and second try to find a date for the concert for which,supposely, this recording has been made.Nevertheless, Chavela's voice remains the same glorious voice as it has always been."
3,Disappointing,"I was so excited to finally be able to afford these sandals. Although the soles felt great, the area around the toe was too loose and sure to cause a blister. I reluctantly returned them."
2,Incorrect Sizing,"I wear a size 9.5-10, or 41 Euro. The only ordering options were US whole sizes but the sandals are manufactured in Euro sizes. Mephisto translates them on the box as Euro 40/US 10 so they sent a size 40 without size 41 ever being an option, otherwise I would have ordered it instead of a US 10. It's not really Amazon's fault that Mephisto translates the sizes wrong, but Amazon shouldn't offer only US size options when the sandals are manufactured in Euro sizes because the sizes don't translate directly. I was really looking forward to these new sandals and even paid extra for overnight shipping, but since they're too small, I had to send them back even though they felt like they were going to be the most comfortable cute sandals I've ever worn. We'll see how a size 41 works. Fingers crossed!"
2,Company didn't honor defective sandal,"While I admit I didn't purchase Helen the Mephisto thong sandal from Amazon, I want you to know I wore them for 3 months and the nails underneath became raised enough to cause drill-like holes in my feet...of course after a while I couldn't wear them, it was too painful. I was told to send them back and a month later they were returned to me with the note that these shoes are not covered by Mephisto warranty. FOR AN EXPENSIVE PAIR OF SHOES THIS IS HORRIBLE. I personally will never buy a pair of Mephisto again. By the way I am not heavy weighing about 135 so my weight could not have affected the shoe."
1,Mephisto Sandals,I have bought many pairs of these exact sandals in the past. I though I would try online to save some money. The sandals hurt my feet and I am unable to wear them. I am disappointed and would not order these online again.
3,Somewhat Dissappointed,These shoes are not as comfortable as I imagined that they would be. The color is really nice and the shoes look good. Maybe they will become more comfortable as I wear them.
5,Mephisto Sandals,The footbed in these sandals are the best I have ever worn. They fit true to size and last a long time. I have had a pair for a year and they are still in good shape. I bought these so I would have a black pair. I will continue to purchase the Mephisto brand for the comfort. I have heel spurs and they don't bother me when wearing these sandals. I would highly recommend them.
5,Mephisto's are great!,"Mephisto Helen Thong Sandals are fabulous. I have plantar fasciitis very badly, have for 20 years. I've been wearing Mephisto sandals for years. It's the only brand of sandals that I can wear without orthotics"
5,mephisto Helen Thong Sandal,"These are the best, most comfortable sandals I have ever worh, a little pricey. Worth every cent for comfort. Long lasting, well made!"
5,Shiva Casein oil set,"The Casein oils came as promised, look exactly as advertised but I haven't started the project they're intended to be used for."
1,a rip off,"i ordered this CD almost a year ago and am still yet to recieve it. first i got an email saying it's special order so i won't get it for a month or so. a little while later the delivery estimate jumped to another month later without any email to warn me. a little while later the order was deleted and now i have no record of ever even ordering it in my account. it was cancelled without telling me and i never got a refund. don't buy this, you probably won't get it."
4,Great study aid!,Am studying in preparation to write the NCLEX- this book is a great review of the basics. The sample tests on DVD are a great help as well
3,Very Overpriced.,"I wanted these cane sticks for mojitos. They are nice, but with the shipping, very overpriced for the quantity."
4,Brilliant packaging,"I had to give it an extra star for the package - the disc is wrapped in a 40's style endpaper with the disc itself looking exactly like a minature 78/33 rpm disc with the black coloration and grooving, the label being exactly the right shade of blue for the 40's. Well done.The music contained in the packaging is solid, the sound is a bit more Smiths than we've heard in the last few albums and I can't decide how I feel about that. I've really enjoyed the depatures of Vauxhall & Quarry - This is for the faithful, and we'll enjoy it, has the usual bite and humor, leans toward the mellow in tone."
3,You have killed me,"Rating out of ten, I would give it a six. Definitely it is not one of the best Morrisey?s albums, but it contains one of his best songs: ""You have killed me"" is on the same level as ""First of the gang to die"", ""Suedehead"", ""Everyday is like Sunday"", ""Bigmouth strikes again""... the kind of songs that you never get tired listening again and again. ""You have killed me"" alone makes the album worth buying."
2,"Big Morrissey Fan, but this album is a ripoff, get the regular one","The album is great but don't buy this 'bonus' album. It does not contain ""footage ""The Youngest Was The Most Loved."" And the only video on the DVD is ""You Have Killed Me."" The other two items (a whopping three items total on the DVD) are a behind the scenes of ""You Have Killed Me"" and behind the scenes of ""In the Future When All is Well."" There's not even the video of ""In the Future When All is Well."" And the behind the scenes footage aren't interviews or anything, they are just snippets of videos clips with the music playing in the background. Don't spend the extra money on this DVD, it's not worth it. But the regular CD is!"
4,Ringleader Of The Tormentors (Deluxe Edition CD & DVD),"Ringleader Of The Tormentors (Deluxe Edition CD & DVD)~ Morrissey is a very good album that features the amazing vocal skills of Morrissey. In fact, I come to think of such great artists such as Elvis and Sinatra when listening to his immense tallent. His lyrics can be a bit obtuse at times and har to understand but most of the time they hit the mark right on. This CD was done in a very witty manner to make in look like LP's of the past and gives it an olde tymey feel. The photographs are great and font in the book-let is easy on the eye. I would definitely recommend this album and I give it well deserved 4 stars out of 5."
4,Good for teens,"I thought this was a cute book. It was not super original or surprising, and in many ways felt a little generic; however, it was well paced, fun and had a happy romantic ending. I would put this book in the rom-com chick-lit categorie. I was a very quick read and would probably be enjoyed by preteen-teen girls. I appreciated the fact that all the content was clean (It didn't contain any sex or swear words) and I would feel comfortable recommending it to my little sister or moms of teens."
4,"Well made, fairly priced","It is well made, with attention to detail. The wires are not only color coded, but are also individually labeled, clearly stating their use. This provided 2 means to make sure you are doing it right. Which was a good thing, because one of the wires was marked incorrectly. However, the color coding made it easy to figure out which wire was marked wrong."
3,Oscar's Ballads,"Spoiled by the likes of Nigerian Marketplace (the only album to have if stranded on a deserted desert isle), and Night Train (a serious classic), I was slightly ""offed"" by this recording - it simply falls a little flat. I'm a monster OP fan, and have many of his works, but this is the 1st I've considered selling back as used. Oscar's Bop/Swing stuff more poignantly captures the spirit of his art, while this recording suggests an effort to captialize on a his reputation for greatness - which he most definitely is! However, if you want to purchase a piano balladeer that is sure to please, try any of Bill Evans'early works, particularly ""Waltz for Debbie,"" but don't make the mistake of making this recording your entre' into the world of Oscar Peterson - get Nigerian Marketplace...Now!!"

1,Healing: Key to Mind Control,"What if there was a book that promised all manner of things and delivered nothing? What is there was a book that you could shell out dollars for and then be lured into shelling out more all so you could buy more books that promise the world and deliver nothing? What if there was an entire series of books designed for the express purpose of getting you into a cult? Well, folks, there is! It's this one or any of Flora's other poorly written over-hyped mind control gateways. These books claim they're different from the rest, that they give new information or information presented simply. I suppose they do the latter--if you enjoy being spoken to like you're in kindgergarten (and the author says you are!) then please buy the books. Just don't blame me when you're forced to write reviews hailing the author as the Second Coming Herself!"
1,Vanity Press At Its Worst,"Self published by her very own cult, Mary Ellen Flora offers information found for free on the internet. This book is only for those who wish to bolster a narcissist's humongous ego."
4,Great book!,This book is very applicable to any environmental engineer interested in biosolid engineering. Very applicable to current EPA standards and great field reference.
4,Nice gift.,"I really liked the pearl necklace, it's nice and affordable. If you're looking for the finest pearls or are a pearl expert, well, I'd advise you to seek a specialized jewelry store but if you're just browsing for a nice affordable gift, this is the right place. I like the necklace and earrings and the look pretty well on my girlfriend. Thanks!."
4,VERY heavy pearls,"For the price, I got what I paid for. VERY heavy odd shaped pearls but once on the neck the look great with heft !!!!! These make a great gift !!"
3,Buyers Luck?,"I own two sets of these pearls and I am hoping to return the second set. The first set was great, but virtually every pearl on the second necklace has a deep ridge which bisects the pearl. It almost looks as if a poorly made miniature plastic Easter egg was put in an oyster for a short while to develop a thin nacre. I was hoping to give this set as a gift and am disappointed."
5,What a Deal!,"These are ""Big Fat Pearls"" for an incredible price! The ""lumpy"" shape is what makes them inexpensive but it also what makes me like them. They can be worn more casually than a traditional string of pearls, i.e. with jeans, etc.They have a ""natural-artsy"" look to them, akin to the designs you see in ""SUNDANCE"" catalog but for a fraction of a fraction of the price (not a typo!!).I'm considering buying a set for each of my sisters. They are quite beautiful.I give them a 2 thumbs ""way up""."
2,Barely Acceptable,"I read couples reviews before I made the purchase, and I was disappointed when I pulled it out from the pouch. It might be just the one that was sent to me is not in a good shape, the majority of the pearls are not smooth, distinctive lines across each pearls."
3,Potato Pearl Review,"This is a beautiful matched set. Unfortunately, the pearl strand was too short and had to be returned. This would be a very fine gift for a young girl; or, small women."
4,real authentic look and feel,"I bought these for my wife on Valentines day. Sadly she was in the hospital for a surgery and came back home on Valentine's day, and when I gave her this gift - her smile made my day.She was floored by the pearl string - flat out. The weight and feel of the real odd shaped pearls is really flattering on a womans neckline. The ""potato"" oddness of the imperfect round shape adds more authenticity to the individual pearls.A very good buy for the value.At least for me, who never can tell a perl from a similarly glistening worthless stone, this string of pearls and the ear buds made my wife wonder how could I have selected such a nice choice..."
5,Good Value,"This necklace has a high luster because of its large size of pearl. And they look beautiful on the neck although they are not that round, because they are shiny and have a pretty good uniform. 29$ is a good price."
3,Me Fecit Solingen,"Some good info for military historians. In hindsite, had this book been done by a large publisher many more copies would of been sold. Good info for blade collectors."
3,Bought for My Daughter,"I personally think Inuyasha is very strange, but my daughter, who has autism, loves the series and has to have every new season set that is released! SHE loves it!!!"
2,Very average,"The strap of this watch absolutely sucks. It is quite hard, and not very comfortable. After wearing for only a month the holder for the strap broke. The watch also has a slightly cheap look to it."
3,Minor problem but otherwise works as advertised,"I wanted a watch to wear while swimming in our backyard pool. Although somewhat skeptical, I took a chance on this one. It has kept time perfectly over the past few months. However, the part of the band that holds down the excess amount of strap beyond the buckle came off within a couple of weeks. This leaves about two inches of band extending out away from my wrist. Once I am positive I won't be needing the excess for any further adjustments, I will simply cut it off. I would recommend this watch with the concern that there could be further problems with the band."
3,Not worth the update,"If you already have one of these books from a previous year, do not bother to buy this 2009-2010 update. I could not find anything new that was offered."
1,Worthless fluff that misses a lot of the good stuff.,"My wife got this for a birtday present. If you are a fifty year old traveler you already know this stuff and a lot more that the author does not cover.Otherwise you are a tourist and you let an agent make most, if not all, of your travel arangements for you.This author thinks that the olny Americans are from the USA. She has left out everyone else from the American continents."
2,Unbelievably Good Deals & Great Adventures Over 50,"My book club had this book on special so I decided to see if I could get it from Amazon cheaper. BOY, am I glad I did! I certainly would not recommend it. I was highly disappointed because there wasn't much for any one under 60 (62 is more like it). Every ""deal"" she listed is common knowledge. I gave it two stars only because some of the organizations listed...is worth checking out. But now you have the number so save your money for a really good book."
5,This is a great birthday gift!,"I give a copy of this book to every one of my friends who turns 50 (and those who are over 50 but don't have a copy yet). I believe that it belongs in the library of every over-50 person! It is filled with endless travel perks, and non-travel perks, that (in most cases) you have to be at least 50 to get. This book is one of the reasons I not only was not depressed about turning 50 (two years ago), but actually started looking forward to it. Joan Heilman gives us reason after reason to celebrate entering the second half of our lives. This book is perfect for all independent, thinking, fun-loving people who are 50 and over."
1,"Title is misleading--should say ""OVER 62""","I agree with the other negative reviews on this book. There's VERY little for anyone under 62. Now if the book were titled ""Unbelievably good deals and great adventures that you absolutely cant get unless you're 'over 62'"" or ""unless youre a SENIOR"" i wouldnt have been bothered. But the ""over 50"" thing? well, it just felt like that was put in the title to get a sucker like me to buy the book (i'm 52)."
4,Unbelievable good deals,Unbelievable good deals and great adventures that you absolutly can't ignore when you over 50. Very informative and helpful for people over 50.
3,Dated,"Amazon, as always,came though with incredible pricing and prompt delivery. This book however, is old and dated, offering no new information. I should have checked to see if it had been revised."
4,Short review/other stuff,"The short review part: good album.The other stuff: to Mr. nu-metal. your taste in music is horrendous. Puddle of Mudd? Heavy? You have to be kidding me. As for the confusing riffs: it's called mathcore. (ie. Dillinger Escape Plan, Don Caballero, The Kickass, ect.) All of these are good bands. Though I wouldnt expect a Limp Bizkit fan to delve that far into the world of music."
4,in spite of everything said,god forbid is the next up in coming band along side candiria. i have seen them three times now and they get better and better at each show. while the cd (determination) is good the recording quality could definiently be better. but the live show they give makes up for it and is better than the cd (that's what counts isn't it?). The combination of metal/hardcore/thrash & melodic riffs are great and i highly recommend seeing GOD FORBID in the flesh and if they don't do it for you then go home! A fan of all likes of hardcore and metal combined!
3,Please Fred Durst's #1 Fan,"If you are a Limp Biscut fan, Im sorry: the only thing that I'll give you credit for is the fact that you actually know about bands like God Forbid, and Lamb of God, or Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, Nile, In Flames etc. And is this guy kidding me saying the drummer isn't that good? Please buddy! If you play the drums, or even if you don't play the drums, pick up the album."
5,Another Way to Dance in the Spotlight,"In this Compelling story of African American influence you become captured in the misunderstandings and mishaps of Viki's summer. As she struggles to realize why her parents recenlty split up, why she doesn't just fit in with the rest of the ballet students, and why her plain to see talent is overlooked by so many Viki rides an enourmous emotional rollercoaster, jerking her in every which way. When she meets Michael, he helps her step off the coaster and put her feet on the ground as he opens her eyes to things she had never taken the time to see. Once you pick up this book you wont be able to put it down I guarantee. Viki finds many other ways to dance in the spotlight without ballet."
5,A standing ovation and several curtin calls wrapped into one,I loved this book from the moment I started reading from page 1. I could not put it down!! I related with Vicki so much having been through some of the same situations myself. This book really captures the African American experience in a predominately white dance school. I was so glad that Vicki could hold her head up high in the end. I felt myself cheering for her and wanting her to find the true meaning of dance. All African American young dancers should read this book. I highly recommend this book. Martha Southgate truly touched me with this one. I cannot wait to read what comes next!
5,"Product arrived fine, no issues",Both the product and my dealings with the company were fine. But they will nag you and nag you until you write a review!
1,cheap price... for a reason.,crap crap crap crap crap.......Buy better wire... this stuff is crap. I have a roll of it for sale!!! :- -and I went out and bought MONSTER wire... as I should have from the start.
1,Thin wire in Thick jacket,This is not 8 gauge wire. I have 10 gauge wire that is twice as thick. This is borderline 12 gauge wire encased in a very thick jacket. I would not recommend this wire.
1,Worst RCA Cable out there!!,I bought this cable about 2 years ago for $60... and out of the 4 channels only 2 were good. One channel had completely failed while the other channel was almost gone (Right out of the packaging!!!_). What good is an RCA cable when 2 out of the 4 never even worked. Made me wonder if Monster Cable does any sort of QA on their products?Regardless... I wound up only using 2 of the channels and connected them to a 2 channel amp.
5,a Cd you have to own!,I love this Cd! JLC have outdone themselves creating a musical style like that of no other band. Who else uses a stand up bass in rock music? They're an amazing band.
5,A breathtaking album by a stunningly talented band!,"Piercing vocals, gorgeous melodies and insightful messages collide in ""Vertigo,"" the second CD to hit the national scene by one of the Southeast's most celebrated acts. This quintet of sonic troubadours truly delivers with 14 fantastic songs, each crafted with curiosity and delicacy. Highlights include ""Angeldust,"" ""The House Our Father Knew,"" ""Come Around,"" and ""Lover's Greed."" This album fuses together everything fans enjoy and will provide a great entree for first-timers. Expect elegant ballads, lovestruck odes to beauty and rocking tributes to family on this masterpiece. Their last album on a major label received significant airplay in the South and in pockets of the East Coast -- anything and everything on ""Vertigo"" could easily arrouse attention far and wide!"
2,Posers,"I'm a big fan of JLC's album 'Magazine' however this album is a betrayal to their uniqueness. This entire album sounds almost exactly like radiohead. I'm a radiohead fan too and this music is good, but it isn't their style. They are trying to hard to make it into the major leagues instead of writing music that shows off their talents for musicianship, and their ability to stand out."
1,Do NOT buy!,"I bought this watch for my lady friend for Valentine's Day last year and have had to have it looked at by a jeweler thinking it needed a new battery; not so. The jeweler informed me that the watch was defective and that the battery was fine. Well by this time all hopes of returning it seemed to have been lost. Oh well, live and learn but don't buy this one!"
3,open a window,"If one is struggling for a deeper understanding and communication with the Deity, this is an excellent book. By focusing on the feminine side of the Deity, one can more easily access one's own deeper wisdom, which comes from deep within the Deity."
2,A shadow of a former self,"While this Tolkien Calendar is of high quality, it suffers from some design flaws enjoyed of Tolkien calendars of years past. The prints are too small and while a small inset at the bottom of each page is nice (especially since it often dipicts a different snapshot of the smae scene, enhancing the scene summary), it does not compare to the spiral bound calendars of the past with the large oversized drawings. The drawings suffer in quality, partly due to their size, partly due to their lack of creativity for the most part. But it is still a Tolkien calendar and should be enjoyed by most."
1,Ugh! What do people see in this artist?,"For the second year in a row, I will NOT be buying the Tolkien calendar - something I have been doing since the mid 70s.Why? Two simple words - Cor Blok. I do not understand his appeal. Lord of the Rings deserves majestic images, not childish, whimsical cartoons. Give us John Howe, Ted Nasmith, Donato Giancola, Alan Lee, Michael Whelan. I will NEVER buy a Tolkien calendar by Cor Blok. Look at the 2011 and 2012 Song of Ice and Fire calendars, or almost ANY Tolkien calendar from years past. Now THAT is art worthy of Tolkien's prose."
1,Ugly-again,I have collected Tolkien calendars since the 70's and for the last two years I can't bring myself to buy this one.Please bring back the artwork of the Brothers Hildebrandt.
1,Oh no!,I repeat the above laments: Not again! I highly dislike the Cor Blok calendars. Movie picture calendars don't count either. Check out Jeff Murray Studios. He has one that is not ugly.
1,What the heck is this junk?,"Not going to sugar coat it ... this ""art"" looks like something out of a 3rd grade art class. What a shame, I really wanted a Tolkien calendar this year. Well scratch that off the list."
1,One star is one too many.,"Another long time Tolkien calendar collector who refuses to own any so-called art by Cor Blok, chiming in...Whose hideously misguided idea was it to push that fellow on the stage? Is no one looking out for the Tolkien reputation? No offense meant, but those pieces look more like frames from Southpark than high fantasy art."
2,Again?,"When the 2011 calendar came out, I applauded the publisher's inclusion of artwork from a different genre than the usual scifi/fantasy. I felt this, even though I did not care for the art myself. Over the years there have been hits and misses. Everyone's tastes are different. However, I do not appreciate the Cor Blok repeat for this year. Two misses in a row? I will be going back to my archives and using an older calendar instead."
1,NOT GOING TO FALL FOR THIS AGAIN,"TOLKIEN CALENDAR 2012I don't think so. This year's art by Block head or whatever, really, really, really sucked. So for the next 12 months - I think I'll put up cute Kittens or ... well maybe not. How about George R.R. Martin, Yeah, thats the ticket.Arnold Visconti"
1,"Please, No More Cor!!!","As the saying goes, I don't know art, but I know what I like. And, what I like is not this so- called ""artist."" I bought the 2011 calendar just to continue my collection; but, I will not be purchasing the 2012. Cor may have met Tolkien, but he apparently does not appreciate the grandeur of his words. They are worth more than a 7th grader's attempt at pleasing the avant-garde art instructor. I am extremely disappointed, and will hope that 2013's artist is more worthy of illustrating Middle Earth."
1,Two years in a row? Are you kidding me?,"One would think that given the reviews of the 2011 calendar that the same mistake would not be repeated. I can understand the desire to add ""flavor"" by introducing more diverse artists, but... this same artist a second year in a row? I silently endured 2011 out of respect for that diversity, but a second year in a row is just too much.A very, very bad decision. They should have heeded the reviews from last year."
5,"TNA, the best in Wrestling.","An awesome wrestling video, great stars of wrestling. A must see for all the wrestling fans."
2,Unconvincing,"The adaptation to modern times of this zarzuela is unconvincing. The cubicles might have worked for the stage, but they don't work for the DVD version and absolutely distract from the music. At some points it is difficult to understand who is who and who is talking (or singing). I don't object the time adaptation per se, but this one does not enhance this masterpiece, on the contrary it takes away the essence of it, it makes following the plot and sensing the music difficult. In addition, the sound production is flat and at some points very week and confusing. In summary, not a good DVD to enjoy a zarzuela Spaniards are so proud of."
3,Too modern for my taste,This Zarzuela is a Spanish classic. And I did not appreciate the final sequence that included a nightclubish act with modern music. I would deffinitely not recommend this item to a newcomer to the Zarzuela. Stick to the original Breton's formula.
5,Love the insight into the Creation of UCONN women's program,"I personally Loved the book, particularly all of the juicy little tidbits of info Geno gives about UCONN players from the year he started to present. Being a Type A personality and perfectionist myself, I understood totally, how and why Geno puts the pressure on himself and his players that he does. Anything less than Perfect is not worth playing the game for. This book was not as much a biography or memoir of Geno himself, as it was of Team players, the School, other coaches, his associate coaches, etc. His relationship with Pat Summit is covered.If you love UCONN Women's basketball, you will love this book.I couldn't put it down."
5,"Auriemma is a jerk, just the kind of jerk I would love to have my daughter play for.","Auriemma is a JERK. The best thing about this book is he tells you that he, CD (his associate head coach), all his assistant coaches and most of all his players know he is a JERK. But even more important, he cares about his players like a parent or that uncle who will always be there when you need them to be does. He doesn't coddle, he doesn't kiss up to good, or even great players. He does sometimes treat players differently, but only because every single one of his players is an individual, but he demands that they play not as individuals, but as a team. He gets the best out of his players because he demands the best out of them and even more so out of himself. He is insecure and cocky. Doubtful and arrogant. A smooth talker and someone who regularly eats shoe leather. He is a real person who I would love my daughter to play for some day if she ever got the chance."
5,Top notch study of Romans,"Takes a refreshing approach to Paul's ministry. This book removes a major plank of supersessionist theology. The narrative picks through some major points, but is not a verse by verse commentary."
4,Another good book by Jerry Ahern,"Ahern writes books as though they were 2 hour episodes of a television mini-series. They are engrossing, entertaining, evocative and based on his Survivalist series. Good reading, very enjoyable."
1,"Ahern is so bold, he doesn't even need grammer!","If I didn't see it in print I would not have believed in its existence. This book was the most poorly written, redundant piece of trash I've ever laid eyes upon. I feel dumber now that I have read it. If you have any self-respect, you will avoid this book like the Black Plague. The adventures of John Rourke consist of stereotypical situations and flat, reactionary characters. It is poorly written and ill conceived."
3,"not enough yoga, may be good for a beginner","I watched this once. For me, there wasn't enough actual yoga. This would be great for a beginner, but for someone who has done yoga for years, it just wasn't challenging enough."
2,not so great,instructor seems nice but does not help or remind about breath and her voice is sort of sorority girl - a bit annoying - could not recommend it - it all seems a bit rushed for newbie
4,good for back in pain,This is not much of a workout but it is great for doing something when your back is really bothering you. I have disc problems and this felt good to do on days when my back was really hurting and I couldnt do regular workout
1,waste of money,"Don't bother buying this one. Go to a good physical therapist for a few visits, get a list of exercises and get them to show you exactly how to do them, and then do it all at home. You'll be much happier."
1,Not Worth the Paper,"Simply facts found in every published article on Ewan McGregor over the last five years, this is another unauthorized bio that wastes trees and the reader's time and money. Skip it."
2,Too heavy on political theory,"This book compares the political theorist/theologian Yves Simon with 'neoconservative' Catholics Michael Novak, Richard John Neuhaus and George Weigel. The author uses outdated political theory terminology, referring to Adam Smith's theories as liberal for instance, so is hard to follow when relying on such labels (as he often does). He also dwells, like all political theorists, on obscure notions and not on practical realities. He does offer good backgrounds on some of the issues, including a scathing criticism of Smith's lack of moral thought, the neoconservatives' unquestioning of the capitalist system and American conservatives' rejections of papal statements on an ideological basis. Mostly, though, this is for political scientists only."
5,Excellent coverage on batik,"This books serves as a wonderful introduction to the world of batik. I bought it as a counterpoint to my books by Rudolf Smend. The chapters are correctly and lucidly arranged, by regions, types and artists, ang give clarity to this complex topic. The examples chosen are simply excellent and represent the epitome of the artform."
2,a differing opinion,"I gave this film an extra star due to the talented cast, but even they can't save this laughably cheesy romance ""novel."""
1,Disappointed Birthday Girl,"My daughter, a true tomboy at heart who loves dress up....as long as it is a super hero!....turned 6 today. She wanted to dress up like superman so we bought her this for her birthday. We opened it and put on the chest piece and then velcroed on the ""pump up"" muscles. I didn't even have time to velcro on the cape and she was crying.The shoulder pieces didn't fit on right and the ""pump up"" muscles kept flipping over to the wrong side of her arm and sliding down to the forearm. I tried to velcro them tighter but then it didn't close right. She is one of the bigger kids in her class (@ the size of an average 7 year old) and if it was velcroed on in the right spot they would slip right off of her arms. It is rated for 3-7 year olds. I can't see how they would fit on an even smaller arm.We will return this and try the inflatable superman suit. I hope we have better luck with that!"
1,Not durable,"Given, kids are rough on toys. This one, however, lasted about ten minutes. Cheap foam-like parts broke quickly. Disappointed overall."
5,inexpensive and gets the jobs done,"several people complained about the rubber breaking down, and I can say this holds up well. I polished 125 linear feet of granite using dry pads and this product worked very well. I struck the underside of the granite a few times on the edge and there is some signs of wear but nothing to be worried about. the velcro sticks very well but not so much removing pads is a pain. overall 5 stars for value and function."
3,not bad nothin great,the first track is fire the rest are sub par average at best but statik does his thing on the beats same for dc the midi alien granite states newer album is way better check it out
5,A perfect fit!,"This part bolted right in. It is actually a simple procedure. I replaced the faulty motor with this one, bolted on the fan, plugged it in and it works like it came from the factory. I shudder at the cost of taking this to a shop for the same repair."
3,Disjointed,"Perhaps this book was't meant to be printed in English. I found this book to be badly written. Someone should have taught the translator/author how to write and have an even flow to the paragraphs. A good through reading and rewrite of this book is in order, due to all the flaws. I believe the author has some good information and a story to tell us, but with the writing, it could have been better.I learned something of the fate of the Iraqi Kurds and why they have an abidind distrust of both the Arabs and Iranians. There was some good stories in this book, but the uneven flow really has a reader wondering.Book could have been better written, and the story could have been longer and more telling."
3,good but not great,"Somewhat interesting, easy reading, an insight into Kurdistan, but perhaps a bit simplistic."
4,Body CT summarized,An ideal text for easy use which highlights the basic anatomy needed for interpreting CTs and the salient points needed to make diagnosis.
4,Solid Book,This book provides a sound foundation of body CT for first year residents getting started. Packs a big punch for such a compact book. I found it very helpful on my first month of body CT. I would highly recommend it.
3,Great Book Horrible Binding-This book self destructs,"As one would expect from the authors,this is a superb overview of body CT with excellent CT reproductions. However,after very little use,reading under 100 pages.the book is FALLING APART,with loose pages falling everywhere.Saunders hit an alltime low with the POOR QUALITY BINDING on this book.My quandry is whether to ask Saunders for a replacement ,as this was a waste of money.This is the absolute worst binding that I have ever encountered in any medical book.and I have a very sizable library."
2,Search a better option,"If you are interested in passing the new TOEIC text, try another option, like a most recent edition of the very same book.This version doesn't come with CD's... end of story.other than that: good quality of product, but almost useless without practice cd's..."
3,Not one of Samantha's Best but Still Ended Well,"I am a big fan of Samantha James and have read every single one of her books. Her books are always excellent. However, this book had me wondering if this was a romance novel because the hero and heroine constantly fought. It wasn't until the last 10 pages of the book that it started getting romantic. I was sort of disappointed but still will continue anxiously waiting for Samantha's new novels. She is an excellent writer."
2,An Exasperating Read!,"This book truly tested my patience! The hero is so dense while the heroine does nothing but fight with him. The whole book consists of nothing but fights, arguments, verbal abuse intersperse with sex. The story has absolutely no direction and I just felt relieved when it ended"
3,"Nice lycra neck and wrists, runs small","I like this shirt, but it's more t-shirt material than knit style and weight.Not very dark black, just medium black.Made in Pakistan.Nothing like a more expensive TriMountain 100% cotton, but about half the price.Runs small; I usually wear a L, would need an XL after I washed it, although it might nottend to shrink up in length like the knit cotton shirts do (like 3 inches, but I'm not tall, so that suits mesince I tend to wear them out, not tucked in).Neck will hold it's shape, and I like it way better than the shirts I got from Kmart or Khols, which I returned.Looks like I'm in between sizes on this Rothco, so I'm returning it. If you are slim, then it might fit you,or order a size larger.I'm afraid this style cotton cloth won't shrink like the knit shirts (which tend to run big until washed)so I'm going to pass on ordering an XL."
4,It does work-I wrote a review just to,"Encourage that this little baby gets sold! (Sorry, to those who it didn't work out for have you tried Ambi's?- i used it back in the day and it didn't do too bad? I prefer the ingredients in this brand.)I must have gotten the right bottle because I have used it once or twice several months before stopped,because i was unsure about it, than picked it back up after 6 months later and it worked literally within a day or two. I put it on my face. I had tiny burn scars on my skin and it has faded it or given it what it needs to lighten! I also have freckles on my face (in my heritage) and some have disappeared.So, it works.I am sure.Extra Tip: You can also: Exfoliate (the area) than apply.Enjoy!"
3,NOT ENAMOURED,I purchased this thinking it might help fade some slight acne scarring. Nothing. Didn't even lighten at all. Had such high hopes and while it moisturized well it didn't fade anything at all. Even tried on some light age spots on hands - nothing.
3,skin lightener,"Been using for a couple weeks now and have not seen much results; however, the cream is smooth and silky and moisturizes well."
5,"Works wonderfully, you have to be patient.","This fade cream works great for me. As with any product that contains hydroquinone, you have to be patient, and i have used several products from over the counter to dermatologist's prescription. I trust this brand, because i have used other Palmer's products, like the cocoa butter, as well as, the acne eventone rescue kit. You should see some results in about a month, but for more noticeable results, it will take 6-8 weeks. Remember to keep sun exposure, especially without sunscreen to a minimum, or you defeat the results. Use spf 15 or higher. It does say that it has sunscreen in it, but it does not say how much, so i would go ahead and use a seperate sunscreen. I use spf 30. If your skin is dark, it does say that results may not be noticeable. Not sure how dark this means though. My skin is a tan/caramel color, and it works wonderfully. Remember, patience patience patience!!"
3,Difficult to get thru,This book is good but not what I expected. Actually I never was able to finish it because it never gets to the point. I am a true crime fan and did not think this book feel into true crime category.It is a book about how Paula's life turns out because of the event of her father's death.
4,181 interesting scientific anecdotes,"Each of the 181 anecdotes here relates the tale(s) of a scientist or a discovery, many affectionately humorous, in short passages varying from one paragraph to several pages. There is no apparent order to the anecdotes, nor is there any editorial narrative to bind them together, so this becomes a book for serendipitous browsing. Each passage is attributed, and the book is supplemented by a name and subject index, though these are not exhaustive.This is an interesting and fun set of disjointed stories, with editorial energies devoted to their selection rather than cognitive cohesion."
2,Would be better with an original idea or two,"I picked up this small-sized graphic novel (actually, a compilation of a four-issue comic book) because I have a longtime interest in Charles Fort and ""Fortean phenomena"" generally -- but it's not really about that. It turns out to be a rather pedestrian, very derivative, anoyingly unimaginative superhero tale in the ""Twilight Zone"" mold, in which Fort (an employee of the New York Public Library) welcomes a visitor from space who is on the trail of an escaped monster-virus killing off New York's business elite (why just them?). Gov. Theodore Roosevelt has a supporting role, as does a young H. P. Lovecraft (who did *not* live in New York as a child), plus a couple of others who are never explained. (I wonder if this was meant to be part of a longer story?) Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Not for True Fans of Charles Fort,I only gave this book one star because of I couldn't give it a 0 as a fan of Charles Fort and proud owner of all his books I decided to check this series out page one was ok but on page two I ended up shaking my head when they said he was a librarian page three i was sick to my stomach and by page four I was telling everybody in my family the flaws and I gave up on page seven I know this is suppose to be fiction but the author of this took a wonderful man with a quiet life who only wanted to tell the world that nothing is what it seems and made him into a wannabee superhero I bet you Charles Fort is turning in his grave at this very incorrect picture of him and what he did but if your into fantasy and is not a big fan of Charles Fort then this is the book for you
4,Pretty decent,"This is a pretty good depiction of what might have happened to a number of people in the Afghanistan action. It's obviously a fairly one-sided portrayal of events, especially once the detention parts start, and it's doubtful that everything happened exactly as portrayed, but in a general sense, I think the movie got things right. While the movie certainly suggests torture and mistreatment, I think the thing to take aways from it is how a situation that is normally seen by both sides to be rather black and white, in fact has a lot of gray areas. You almost have to watch the movie a couple times to be sure of what's what. The characters aren't developed very well, and that along with action that develops quickly and chaotically can sometimes create a bit of confusion as to what's happening to whom."
5,These small incidents and unsaid facts behind the news!,"Inspired by real facts, this demolishing and realistic movie told in documental style, reveals and shows us part of the unknown truth after the fatidical and painful sequel of 09/11.The crude story deals with four guys who unexpectedly will be involved into a web of supposed acussations which intend to make them to confess they are part of terrorist cells into this well convulted region.Penetrating and absorbing this film was awareded with one of the major artistic achievements, earning the coveted Silver Bear in Berlin.Don't miss it."
3,A bit slow,"This DVD was on a very important topic, but like many documentaries, it was a bit slow. I would still recommend that Americans see it to understand some of what was done in our names. Shameful and still happening."
4,No Piety for the Abused,"It is a story of explicit abuse of British Pushtu's human rights in which being abused attracted not much piety at all because energy sustaining terror and breading the martyrs worldwide from their nations' cradles, is surely even much less deployed and usable to peaceful means in the UK traditionally (for instance,Kidulthood).Depicting of a natural Afghan landscape is perfect. Very educative on these merits."
1,Tripe,The premise is absurd: three all-British blokes go to Pakistan after 9/11 for a friend's wedding and through sheer accident and bad luck end up in Kandahar?The fact that Ruhal Ahmed has now admitted that he was indeed in Pakistan for terrorist training makes the whole story a lie. It is difficult to believe much of any of it after that.
4,Good Casual Knife,This is an excellent knife for casual use. The size is perfect and allows it to fit comfortably in your pocket. The blade is razor sharp and stays that way longer than I expected. The skeleton handle makes it easy to keep clean and looks cool too.I give it 4 stars because its not easy to close. It locks open using the body so you almost HAVE to use both hands every time to close it.It's definitely worth the price though.
3,"This is the most misleading title ever, still no clue way it is called Diamond Dogs?","DL's is a gun for hire and guide some peeps into the bad side of a bad country is search of a rug or was it drapes, that doesn't matter. Bottom line is they aren't the only one. BANG BANG BANG BOOM watch DL try his best to get his team and the drapes out of alive."
3,IT ISN'T GOOD MOVIE!!!,THIS MOVIE WAS NOT GOOD AS I THOUGHT. BECAUSE IT WASN'T EXCITING. I JUST RENT THIS MOVIE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD BUT IT'S NOT. THE STORY WAS A LITTLE SHORT AND THE MOVIE LOCATION WAS NOT GREAT. THAT'S ALL I SAY.
1,One of the Worst,"This was one of the worst movies that I have seen in a while, and I have seen some bad movies. Poor production quality, unlikable characters, uninteresting locations and absent story.Save your money on this one. If you have one of the services where it doesn't cost you to view videos, this one is still too expensive.By the way, I tried to rate this film at zero start but the program wouldn't let me."
1,TWO THUMBS DOWN (Save your money & time),"The only thing amazing about this film is that Dolph Lundgren is actually getting WORSE as an actor. Even when surrounded by wooden performers and performances like those in Diamond Dogs, he's bad.The lead character narrates this story on himself - a down on his luck mercenary. The oft-referenced mystery of why he was booted from the U.S. Army as a Green Beret is never revealed. He kills people with the ease of clipping fingernails and as a soldier is neither believable nor fun. It's just a stupid, embarrassing attempt to get back into the movie limelight.In reality, you could replace failed ""mercenary"" with ""actor"" and this work becomes Lundgren's autobiography.I had a free rental at Blockbuster for this, and still wanted to ask for my money back.Save 94 minutes of your life for something worthwhile."
4,A fun chick lit.,"In Accidental It Girl, Sadie Price, photographe-stalkerazzi, really learns her lesson after having a run in with a hot male actor, Ethan Wyatt. He decides to teach her a lessen by giving her a taste of her own medicine.If you're a fan of tabloids (like I am) you'll really see things in a different light after reading this book. It was nice to see the other side of the story and how paparazzi really go after anything just to make a story."
3,Enjoyable,"This book is enjoyable, not brilliant or unputdownable but its the perfect read to relax and unwind. No thinking required just read and relax"
2,"Libby writes well, so...","I would like to read something by her other than chick-lit. It's not her thing, and you kind of feel it.The subject was interesting, but the story predictable. And some of the characters have more substance than others.I personally did not like this venture very much, but I will definitely give Libby Street another chance."
3,Don't waste your money on this album!!,"The Velvet Underground is by far one of my favorite bands. But they are not a ""best of"" band. Don't waste your money on a greatest hits CD!! Go and buy their four full length albums. Any one of those is more enjoyable than Best of: The Words and Music of Lou Reed. Actually I recommend starting with the third studio recording--The Velvet Underground."
4,"All Great Songs, But Not Complete","The only way to make a fair compilation of the Velvet Underground's material is to take every song they ever recorded and put in on one compilation. The closest thing to do this is the box set Peel Slowly And See, which stays true to the albums. This compilation, however, does not. I agree with all the other reviewers, all the songs on this CD are incredible, but that shouldn't be done to VU. I do think that this album might be a good starting place. However, that may not be true. This was the first CD I bought by VU, and I honestly didn't like it too much. It wasn't until I decided to buy their first album that I releaized the full genius of the Velvets. Think about what the other reviewers and I have said before you buy this CD."
2,the stars rate the cd not the content,"I could never bring myself to give the songs of the Velvet Underground a bad rating.BUT if you need an introduction to the band this is not it.The recent live album (MCMXCIII) would do better.And why would anyone want to remaster the sound of any of these songs? These songs defy remastering.The 4 original albums were meant to sound the way they do.Don't accept ""updated"" or ""beefed up"" sound when buying Velvet."
5,A Smashing Good Time,"OK. This is a greatest hits compilation. Half of it is most of the first Velvet LP. If you aren't sure about the VU, buy this one and then, after listening to it, buy the original catalogue of their LPs.The VU is a group that the hardcore vinylphiles have to make an exception for and go get the CDs. VU albums tend to be played to death. I felt a sense of betrayal to the period buying VU on CD initially. However, upon hearing 'All Tomorrows Parties' in digital playback with headphones, I chucked that guilt.The music is wonderfully appealing. Like pied pipers, the VU makes the idea of popping a vein full of heroin at Andy's [Worhol] flat or freezing in the icy New York streets in the early morning waiting to score seem like a fun idea."
1,ANOTHER GOOD SHOW RUINED BY GREED,"Kannagi: It's a 14 Episode series that Bandai is releasing 7 eps at a time.It's over priced, this is a subtitle only and the only possible plus is the lower compression then the import [...] What little i could see of the free episode from Bandai the subtitles are about the same, maybe they improve later but i couldn'ttell from the little i was able to see. I enjoyed the series and if it weredub in English I'd buy it again. Bandai has delayed the release of it'sdubbed titles to release these overpriced subtitle only dvd's."
4,"Even in its ""infancy"", the trio was better than most!","TTT's sophomore album was the stuff of which legends were made: innovative, funky, soulful, and reflective. Like other reviewers have stated, their later work was better, but this earlier release stands as one of the strongest ""second helpings"" in R & B history."
4,It does rain in S.CA!,"What a great song on a pretty darn good cd. This is TTT's best cd, anniversary is their best song, but this is by far their best cd!"
3,Pretty Good,"This is a Pretty Good.I dug Feels Good,Oakland Stroke with Vanessa Williams a cool tribute to Tower Of Power&Sly&THE FAMILY Stone.The Blues is tight.It Never Rain In Southern California is a Classic slow-jam.WHatever you want.the Grooves&Slow Jams are Pretty Good but their Material gets Better on Later Albums."
4,Complete coverage of an amazing era...,"John's mom, Ann is my hero. She'd 'board' me at her Cape Cod guest house (River House) on Bass River in thelate 40's whenever my dad would leave for business. I knew John and his twin, Mike, but they were seldom home.As a single mom, Mrs. Graham was gracious, amazingly competent, and a major boost to my esteem during those challenging times. This is my chance to salute her, publicly. No wonder her twins were so successful. tk"
5,"For liner enthusiasts, this is THE book on the subject.","Having been an ocean liner buff for my entire life, I have always been on the lookout for outstanding books on the subject. I happened to be in my local library a few years ago browsing for books on vintage liners when ""The Only Way To Cross"" caught my eye. Immediately upon getting back home I opened it up and read, ""The North Atlantic is the most dangerous ocean in the world..."" This opening line assured me of many pleasurable reading hours to come. ""The Only Way To Cross"" is a masterpiece of historical description and engrossing personal narrative worthy of forming the centrepiece of anybody's library on the subject. My thanks to John Maxtone-Graham for this one-of-a-kind. GET THIS BOOK!"
2,Butane & Propane top 2 of 3 ingredients,"Irrespective of how well this might work, I was dismayed to order this only to find out butane and propane are top ingredients in this product. This is a highly flammable, highly toxic product that I wouldn't have purchased had I know what was in it. Why do I want to spray my hair with butane?"
2,Smell great..doesn't work so great,"Smells great, but leaves white residue on my dark hair. It doesn't work as well for me as Pfffft from Walgreens."
3,Expecting more,Thought this was a quick hurry fix. Made my hair feel dirtier and heavy. Probably would never buy again.
5,Love this stuff,"Perfect for a little touch up, this stuff is great. Follow the directions for best results. Helpful to have the right brush too. Smells fresh"
1,Turns your hair white and smells awful!,"I have long, naturally curly hair that I can't wash every day, so I've been trying out dry shampoos. This one is probably the worst that I've tried. It is like a spray powder that turned my hair white. It smells awful -- like bug spray or repellant -- and it really didn't do anything good for my hair. I'm not at all pleased."
2,Works ok,"I've been experimenting with alot of dry shampoos and this one I wasn't thrilled with. It really didnt take away much of the oils out of my hair and the smell wasn't bad. It did a little something, but nothing great. It's cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,I've waited quite a while to find a product just like this,"I used to wash my hair everyday until a friend mentioned to me that it's not necessary to do that. So after researching as to why this wasn't necessary I decided to wash my hair every other day. Problem is my hair gets a bit oily after one day of not washing it and I also really like the smell of shampooed hair. Not that my hair smelled bad but I just wanted to freshen it up a bit. So I did some more research and decided to try this product. So far I like it, I noticed the oiliness issue has improved and I especially like the tropical coconut fragrance. The one little complaint I have is the talc residue feeling after I spray it therefore I try to apply very little on my hair to avoid this. Price is also pretty decent."
3,it's okay but not the best,"it smells good and you hair stops smellig bad, but it makes it kinda sticky, especially in several hours of wearing it. otherwise, like an emergency thing for using for onlly a couple hours it works"
4,Works wonders!,"I really like this product. I have thick hair and it's naturally dry so I hate washing it everyday or even every other day.. but I also work out everynight... well that creates a problem! This product is great, I use it between washes to keep my hair fresh and bouncey and smelling nice! I wanted to give it 5 stars but I only gave it 4... the reason? The ingredients. They seem kind of harsh.. but hey it works!"
3,better than most,i really dislike dry shampoos. I keeo trying them in hopes that there is going to be a breakthrough. This one was better than most.
3,Does the Job but Scent is Overpowering,"All these dry shampoos seem to do a good job of giving you a quick pick up for your hair when you don't have time to wash and they all give volume just by the nature of the product. But, they all also have way too much fragrance and none of them really pleasant. I end up washing my hair anyway because i don't want to go anywhere smelling like I dumped cheap body powder in my hair."
3,"Works well, but creates severe build-up.","It smells and works great, but I've noticed that in comparison to other dry shampoos, this one has a tendency to leave a ton of extra crap on your scalp. I found that I had to wash my hair a lot earlier than anticipated. Batiste works fine, but I would rather use a brand that leaves my hair feeling lighter and more voluminous."
4,Instant fresh me up,"Bought this because it is perfect for traveling and when you really don't have time to wash your hair. It is good for an instant freshening up.The smell is quite nice, it is not too strong and there are several different scents, this one is my favorite though, it has a coconut essence to it. I was surprised at how clean your hair looks after a few sprays.Just make sure you don't spray it too close to your scalp-I have dark hair and if I spray it too close it is too intense and it can be difficult to get rid of the white powder."
3,"not too bad, good price","I prefer B&B and Algemarin dry shampoos, but this isn't bad for the price. The smell isn't bad either."
1,Worse than plain cornstarch,"This product is a waste of money! It smells terrible, clogs easily, and doesn't work as effectively as plain cornstarch! If you're willing to spend the money[...]. If not, just buy cornstarch. This stuff is terrible!"
5,Great product,The shampoo really makes your hair look like it's clean and healthy and smells good. I'd surelly buy it again!
3,"It works, but less in the can than I expected","With something so light, it's hard to tell how much is in the can. I have pretty greasy, but short, hair and maybe I needed to use a lot but I ran out in just 3 weeks. For that price, I've decided to use baby powder. It works amazingly well and is much, much more affordable."
5,Great Product,This is the best dry shampoo out there. I have been using it for more than a year and love getting second day hair as a result of using it.
3,"not the best, not the worst","I've been testing all kinds of dry shampoos, and this one is just OK. It does leave the trademark white residue, but also leaves the hair feeling soft once it's absorbed. Works well, but I'm not a fan of the smell at all. And it's kind of pricey for the size, especially when you compare to some of the drugstore brands."
3,"This product isn't bad, but there are better ones out there","I know that some people dislike this scent, but I thought that it was rather decent.If you are looking for a dry shampoo that has a more fragrant smell (rather than just a clean/dry smell that most have), then this product may be for you. It has a floral scent. Very feminine.Quality-wise I believe it is so-so.I don't like the consistency of the product or the way it sprays into my hair. I don't hate the product, but I don't think I would recommend it to a friend."
2,Only used 5 times!,"I literally was only able to use this product 4 times before the can was empty. Are you kidding? That right there is the deal breaker for me.Outside of the fact that you'd have to buy 4 bottles a month to have enough, it worked pretty well. My hair no longer looked oily , which was great. However, the smell wasn't the best in the world. It's a little too tropical for my taste... whenever I'd get a whiff, I wasn't happy about it."
2,leaves residue,"i know how to use this, i had used several cans of this before the one i bought on Amazon.i don't know why, but it left white residue on my hair (my hair was blonde) since when i had about a half of it left..which hadn't happened before. i used to buy this product at my local Ulta. but i ordered it online because i didn't have time to drive to the store. i don't know if the product was old or wrong, or i used it in improper way.anyway, after using several bottles i thought it was waste of money and time(to make sections, brush, and get rid of residue), so stopped using this.product works ok though."
3,Not bad for the price,I have used many different dry shampoos over the last few years because I have oily hair at the roots. I hate washing it everyday so have resorted to dry shampoos. This dry shampoo isn't fabulous but it does absorb the oils and has a nice tropical smell. I would purchase again but still looking for that awesome dry shampoo that doesn't leave that white residue.
3,still searching...,"My first memory of having used ""dry shampoo"" was when I was growing up in Germany in the early '80s. It was pretty popular over there. I was recently pleased to discover similar products were being marketed here in the states, and having run out of the German brand my mom brought back from her recent trip overseas (which was not such an exceptional product anyway), I decided to give this brand a go.Needless to say, while the tropical scent is pleasant at first, it soon proved intoxicating. I wasn't very impressed, as it left a heavy, flaky residue, and therefore, I'm resuming my search for the perfect dry shampoo. In the meantime, I'm washing my hair :/"
2,Will dry out your hair.....,"I bought this for my daughter who has dry yet very oily hair. She needs to wash her hair every day but that is supposedly bad so we decided to buy the Batiste. After using it for a week she already has little dry patches but they had become so irritated that they just became huge and out of control. Her hair became very dry and dull looking. We stopped using it and have been washing her hair again with dandruff shampoo. We have it back under control. I do not recommend this to anyone with oily, dry hair. It will irritate and aggrivate your dandruff even more."
5,Used as a styling product,"I read an article about stars using this product to add body to their hair. I tried it on clean hair, spraying close to the roots. It really does work. I have not tried it on dirty hair."
5,Skeptic Turned Believer,"You have to try it to believe it.Yeah it smells strong at first, but that fades right away.I have long thick brown hair, that gets greasy fast. I love this stuff, I just used it to test it and it worked! Thank you Batiste You bought me a couple more days of washing my hair!Cheap and works!"
2,Not working,"When I first spray it on my hair, my head feels cold. At the begining, it sort of make my hair less oily feeling. But after half an hour or so, my hair gets more oily than before. And since you would spray gray powder out from the can. The powder would sit everywhere, very messy. I don't like it at all. Don't waste your money on this dry shampoo."
4,Pretty good stuff,"I received the product in a more than reasonable amount of time, but my only complaint is that while it makes hair look ""fresh"" for a while, its definitely not something that lasts all day, so you'll need to toss it in your purse for touch-ups."
3,No complaints,"I actually havent used it yet. But i smelled it. it smells fine. kind of powdery. I bought the original one. Mine came with a mail-in rebate that lets me try it for FREE. :) I bought this for my wig to reduce the shine. I'll edit later to say the results, but I have seen demos on youtube that say it works."
1,Not Pleased,"I ordered this product because I read other reviews claiming that it was ""the best dry shampoo."" It was a great price, under $5 and I was very excited to get it.The product came quickly and I tried it immediately. But was unpleased with the results. This product turned my hair white [my hair is dark blonde/light brown]and although the white color brushed out easily, it really didn't do anything for it. It didn't make it look clean or shiny as it claimed it did.Basically, I wasted $5 to find out this product doesn't work. I'd be interested in trying another one, though I hope it works next time."
5,Fantastic product.,"Girlfriend's exact words: ""I honestly do not think there is a dry shampoo that works as well as this product!Just to give a little background: I have been using it for about 2 months now. I am the type to only wash my hair every other day. I would not say I have extremely greasy hair or dry. I do color my hair often.Every day that I do not wash my hair, I use this.. and it makes my hair feel just like it did the day before. It lasts for about... 10-15 hours depending on how much you touch your hair(or how windy it is outside). It works well even if you have already sprayed your hair earlier that day. If you want to curl your hair but you don't have time to shower and curl, then just spray it on before curling. Your curls may not hold quite as well, but they will last almost as long as they would on clean hair.Highly recommended!!"""
4,Good stuff!!,"I have long blonde fine hair that gets a little greasy the day after shampooing. This product works better than I thought it would!! Got rid of the greasies all day - and woke up the next morning with non-greasy hair too! Very impressed, especially for the price. Not sure if it would show up gray on darker hair, but that seems to be a complaint. Smells a little weird, but not bad... plus, the smell doesn't stay longer than a couple mins anyway. Downside: leaves white residue all over my bathroom counter, floor, etc. Use in a well-ventilated area/outside... inconvenient obviously, but I don't think there's much the company can do about that. Highly recommended."
2,Batiste Dry Shampoo,"I guess it did what it was supposed to - made my unwashed hair look a little cleaner in a pinch.However, the can is an AEROSOL SPRAY, something that wasn't clear from the description. This makes it hard to aim without spraying toxins into one's eyes, and is unneccessary, since it's just a type of cornstarch powder product. Plus, it has that disgusting odor that all aerosol hairsprays seem to have. It made me sneeze and my hair stink the whole day, despite the attempt to cover it up with fragrence. I threw it away after one use."
1,Smell is offensive!,"Pro: it's cheapCon: The smell was way so strong and offensive I couldn't use it.Bottom Line: I bought 4 travel size ""dry shampoos"" to evaluate each one on a basically side by side basis. This one - Batiste Dry Shampoo - is my last choice.Klorane Extra-Gentle Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk 1.06 fl oz (50 ml)Rene Furterer Naturia Dry Shampoo - Travel SizeOscar Blandi Pronto Invisible Volumizing Dry Shampoo Spray 1.4 ozBatiste Dry Shampoo, Original 1.6 fl oz (50 ml)"
4,Great Stuff!,"I love this stuff! I have side swept bangs that hang over my forehead and eyes so they just get greassy fast, but this Bastie spray takes the grease away perfectly! My only complant is that it only lasted about a month, (I did use it everyday) but for the price I think its a great buy!"
4,smells good =],"the seller was fine and everything. arrived quickly, and just as described. i just thought the product was not that great. i used it in the morning and thought it was good at first. then within a few hours at school it wore off or something because my hair no longer looked clean."
1,value compromises quality,"I found this product in a local beauty shop and figured I'd give it a try, being that it was a fraction of the cost of the dry-shampoo I normally use. I have been known to be overly scent-sensitive, which certainly could be a factor in this, but as has been mentioned, the smell of this product made it impossible for me to use - I wound up throwing it away after trying to get used to it a few times. it's this weird citrusy/babypowderish combination that is utterly sickening. on top of this, I didn't find the product itself to work all that successfully when compared to other similar products I have used. all in all, I do not recommend the batiste dry shampoo - the price is enticing, but the poor quality ruins any price advantage."
3,Just Okay,"This product works fairly well, and did clear up all oil in my hair for the day. However, its scent was very hard to get used to. It smelled like a cheap, citrus perfume. After about an hour of smelling it, it was so bad that I finally had to pull my hair back in a ponytail to get the smell away from my face.I would recommend this product for camping, or maybe for doing chores around the house."
5,Amazing for no-wash hair days!,Great priced product! Smells nice and definitely works to get the grease out of my hair when I don't have time to wash and dry it. I'm a big fan!
2,It worked great for ONLY 3 uses,I loved the product but since I only got to use it three times I wont buy it again. I used it before church and when I came home the can was wet (from condensation). When i tried to use it again it did not work.
5,I like this product!,Batiste Dry shampoo does the job it's intended for. It feels cool when you spray it on which is very refreshing. The smell is nice too.
3,"When you have that not-so-fresh feeling, UP there...use something else","Meh... This is no Holy Grail of dry shampoos. It removed perhaps 50 percent of the oiliness at my roots, so I'll stick to my old-fashioned routine of water and Pantene every day."
2,Batiste Dry Shampoo,The transaction was great. I received the product within a weeks time. The shampoo does absorb oil however I don't like the fragrance.
2,It's ok...,"The Batiste Blossom smells good but somewhat messy. I didn't know it was white powder so was surprised to see my very dark hair covered in white powder, though it did brush out. Didn't do much for my scalp which is what really needs freshening. Expensive for what you get. I found the Weave Organic Root Stimulator hair freshener that eliminates odor and freshens hair, oil free, 4 oz at $4.99 at a beauty supply store that caters to African-American clientele. It's non-aerosol. I spray it lightly in my hair and in my hands that I rub through my scalp. It dries pretty quickly on it's own; or can blow dry. It works well but use a light tough; otherwise your hair will be soaking wet. Bumble and Bumble's hair powder is AWFUL and very very expensive -- do not buy!P.S. the new Suave dry shampoo works pretty good but use sparingly otherwise will get that gunky feeling on your hair (5/6/2011)"
3,Delta Believe Again Tour From an Amazon Supplier.,"The CD was great ( Her voice is even better live than in the studio.)but since the DVD was in PAL format"" I will never know"". My fault; I should have known that anything outside of Nortn America would be a different format."
5,Takes you back to the true meaning of house music!,"There is dance music out there and then there is inspirational muisc out there and there is also feel good music out there. This Album takes you back, to what house music is all about; Feel good, inspirational, sould stirring dance music. This CD was truly a joy for me! I bought a new system just for my house music and there is very little house music that has not been inspired by the GODFATHER of house music, Frankie Knuckles!. I am from Chicago, where it started, I was there at the beginning,I was there when New York took it to the next level, and I am happy that they carry the torch overseas, I Love this CD!"
3,Fills in some of the gaps on my collection,"I was really excited to get this one but after listening, I am somewhat disappointed. Convertion and Cheryl Lynn, Candido, Billy Ocean and Change excellent choices; Sandee, SoulIISoul pretty good but the rest are warm up songs for other DJ's that know better. Not sorry I bought it but not happy with song selection"
4,Under appreciated but not bad if you want Nick Fury & Shield,"Like Hasselhoff or not the film is a classic comic story brought into a movie that seems to be for a potential weekly series that never got picked up. As someone who has read the comics I was entertained, it is great to see Fury vs Hydra instead of the typical Batman-Joker, SpiderMan-Goblin, Superman-Luthor that have been done.If they made this film today with all the effects you can easily add now it would be pretty good. As it is old technology you have to forgive that.As far as the price I think that is based on supply & demand. I can't imagine they pressed more than 10K of these if that many so if you need to own a copy....I say watch it once and you will be all set.They need to do a Fury film with Jackson since Marvel made him the Movie version"
1,$80??,"Really? No, really? Seriously, really? No, wait, seriously really? $80? Really? David Hasselhoff as Nick Fury? Really? Used copy for $69? Really? Is that actually a joke?"
1,Not happy with this product!,"Although this product seemed to install correctly, I'm not seeing any traffic. After doing a couple of hours of research to find out why, I find out you have to go to the companies site and download some updates and then you may possibly have to reinstall FSX. And if that doesn't work you may have to reformat your computer and reinstall everything. So unless you want to deal with all that crap, stay away from this product. I will be returning mine!"
1,IT DID NOT INSTALL,I could not get this product to install. I have a DVD drive. They say somethng about copy protection maybe being a problem. Stay away from this one!!
1,it was first and last time to buy from this manufacture,I am use this paper for U-Sand orbital sander and with other paper it working longer and make better result.
3,cute little gift,"I gave this to a friend of mine at her shower. The book was smaller than I expected which is probably my own fault for not looking at the details closer. Everyone was interested in looking through it though. It wasn't any mind blowing present, just a nice little addition to a bag of gifts."
5,A real woman,"These letters are the life and thoughts of an honest-to-God human female--a real woman, not a trumped-up tricked-out product of society. She is inspiring, honest, real, and as wild and natural as Africa itself was during her time. Every woman who has truly lived, even a little, will see herself in these pages. I reread it every few years as a pep-talk for courageous living, humility, and honesty. I will forever feel sad that she had to leave Africa."
1,Rip off DVR,You need only look at that cover art to know that this is a rip-off DVD-R. Stay far away from this company. A2Z or whatever the heck they're calling themselves.
5,Lugosi Does King Kong For Laughs,"After King Kong came out just about every movie studio wanted to find a way to rip off the movie and come out with their own gorrilla/monkey movie.This is an example of the genre - but unlike most it got a big star (Bela Lugosi) and decided to play it as a comedy - two things that distinguish this film from other king kong knock offs.You get the pacing of a screwball comedy along with the typical monster movie conventions.It's a b movie, but one that is more interesing than a lot of others from this era."
1,poor packaging!!!!!!!!,"What a nightmare when I opened the box! The bolts, washers and nuts were scattered all over the box. As expected, most of the pieces were missing. I was alsonot able to find any Square End Cap. The left and right beams were also scratched and the base of the beam was dented. I'm not even sure if I'm able to fit inthe base end cap. These were just some of the few things I have noticed upon quick inspection. Not sure what else is missing or wrong with the rack. I'm returning the item. What a waste of my time."
4,Works great,"This was purchased to hold a set of dumbells ranging from 5 lbs, up to 45 lbs. Everything fits fine, and some people complained about the smell and odor when unwrapping this from the packaging - i had none of this."
4,Good Value,The Apex Dumbbell Rack was easy to assemble. The material is sturdy enough for most home dumbbell racks. The baked painted finish is consistent but may not wear well; time will tell.
4,Same as everyone else,"The rack seems solid & well built. Just like others, my hardware packet broke apart during shipping. And just like others, my outer box had holes in it. You guessed it, I was missing hardware. A quick trip to Lowe's for 7 bucks worth of hardware & it was put together in about 20 minutes. I would still recommend the rack for the price. Just be prepared to make a trip to the hardware store."
5,Apex Deluxe dumbbell rack,"I love this product and it was cheap enough. I would say I do wish I would have purchased a larger one because I have purchased more dumbbells that won't fit on the rack and it is like only a extra 50 lb set so they end up on the floor, no biggie the produck it great."
4,Sturdy,This rack is just what I needed. It is very sturdy and easy to put together. Holds all my weights and does not take up much space.
5,Dumbbell Rack,Rack is just what I needed. It's sturdy and holds a set of dumbbells nicely. It's small enough to not take up a lot of room but still big enough to do the job.
4,Heavy duty dumbell rack,"I looked at several dumbbell racks on Amazon and finally decided to go with the Apex 3 tier. VERY happy with this product. As many items I have received from Amazon, the box was destroyed. Not sure what goes on at their facilities but they are hard on some cardboard! Regardless, all the items needed to assemble the rack (nuts/bolts) were in the box and I put it together in about 10 minutes. This thing is very well built and extremely sturdy. I have dumbbell pairs including 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 50 pounds on this rack. I would have given this rack a 5 star rating if they had made it about 4 inches wider because I could have stacked my 45 and 60 pounders on it as well. Regardless, great product. It is like sitting your dumbbells on a concrete floor except now I don't have to bend over and pick them up."
3,"Good dumbbell rack, but...","I highly doubt that one I received is brand new; covered with dust, paint scraped off in a lot of places, and some rust. I had to spend quit a bit of time to clean it up that was not fun. Ater all, it is a good, steady rack. So, 4 stars for the rack; 2 stars for the seller. I wouldn't have another business with this seller again."
3,Not as advertised,"The product seems fine, but the description on the Amazon website is incorrect.It says ""accommodates all dumbbell styles and sizes."" This is not true. Our smaller dumbbells do not fit on the rack properly.We are going to flip the rails around and put a piece of plywood in between to make it work."
3,Not for all types of dumbells,The item is very stilyst and sturdy; however I was a bit disappointed when I realized it does not hold dumbells under 5lbs. My 2lbs and 3lbs are on the floor.
4,I like it,Nice and heavy - easy to build - but small dumbells do not fit on rick - will have to divise a way for them
3,"Great rack if it were not defective (5 stars for the product, 1 star for shipping a defective product, 3 stars overall)",The rack is the perfect size for what I needed but the one I got was defective. It was clearly returned by someone else since the blister wrap that the nuts and bolts came in were opened and some washers were missing. I didn't think anything of it until I had it put together almost all the way and then realized that the alignment was off so the bottom rack would not fit properly and the bolt would not fit through the hole. At this point it would have been too much hassle to disassemble and ship it back so I just hammered the bolt in and dealt with a crooked rack. I will be ordering the same rack again since I need a second one but I hope the one I get this time has not been returned and then shipped out again without the defect being fixed.
3,Small but it works,It needs to be a big bigger and have pads for the dumbbells but for the price I can't complain.
5,Well Pleased,"Well built,powder coating finish look's great.All parts wrapped and easy to put together 25 minutes. Dumbbell's easy to get on and off rack do to design."
1,Cannot believe the positive reviews on this item!,"First, my dumbbells did not fit on this rack! They are neoprene. Also, the hardware provided didn't fit. The nuts had little rubber stoppers that prevented the screws from being tightened. Big dissappointment. Returning today."
1,Piece of C--P,Just tossed this piece of c--p in the garbage!!!! What a waste!!!! Spend the extra money on a better brand.
5,Good Appearance and Functionality,"This product looks good with a charcoal hammered enamel finish. It assembles easily with no issues. Its very sturdy and because the rack is slanted front to back, its easy to access the weights.I like the three racks because it fits a full complement of dumbells with some room left over for extra plates for a bench press. As an example, I have hexagonal dumbells, and my weight set-up is as follows: 5-8-10-15 lb pairs on the top rack; 20-25-30 lb pairs on the middle rack; and 35 lb on the lower rack along with my extra 5lb and 10 lb plates (which I made a simple holder for)."
5,Very Pleased with this Product,"This product is great! It is easy to assemble and very sturdy. On another note . . . I'm not trying to take the wind out of the sails of people that bought the Bowflex or PowerBlock adjustable dumbbell, but I was always suspicious about how well they actually worked. I also felt weird whenever I went to a local fitness equipment store and they worked so hard to try to sell these to me with claims of ""these cost less than a non-adjustable set"" or ""these take up less space."" I know deep in my heart that these salesmen don't care about saving me money or how much space I have, they want to make a higher profit. I know that the traditional dumbbells like the ones I bought for this rack will be more versatile, can work with all exercises, won't break easily, and probably last me 15-20 years. Check out my customer picture for this product."
5,Excellent quality & price,"I was comparing this to the Body Solid GDR363 which was slightly more expensive, but since I needed two I went ahead and got this one.Honestly, I have no complaints. It's incredibly sturdy, looks good, and was easier than expected to assemble. No need to get anything more complicated or expensive."
1,Buyer Beware,Was not packaged well. Components received damaged and the parts bag was damaged enough that it was open and parts were missing.
5,Excellent buy for a Great rack if your box is complete,"Very Solid and Nice looking Rack.Like other review says, All the nuts,bolts,washers we're all loose in the packaging.Be very careful unpacking it, as I had washers stuck on corners of box, bolts inside of the metal.I was lucky enough to find all the loose parts.Great deal if you're parts are complete!"
4,Apex 3-Tier Rack,The Apex weight rack was fairly straight forward to assemble. The rack feels like it is well made and the materials are quite sturdy - product is exactly as advertised.
2,Packaged poorly and dented when I got it,"Overall this is the product I needed for my dumbbells, however it was either packaged poorly and damaged during shipment or there was no quality check before it was sent out. When I opened the package and started to assemble it, one of the legs had a huge dent on the outside part.Obviously it is going to get banged up with use (especially weights going on and off all the time), but it always frustrates me to get something already messed up. Will still use this product since it is what I am looking for but will definitely avoid this seller when possible in the future."
4,Easy assembly,"Assembly was very simple. I saw several racks with the same dumbbell capacity with a much higher list price so this was was a good value. Plus, I finally got my dumbbells off the floor so my home gym looks great!"
3,not bad for the price but i would change a few things if i was apex,"ok just got this rack put together today so lets start from the beginningpacking - packing was ok but the nut and bolt pack broke and they where laying all over the boxassembly - easy assy took about 10 min only 12 bolts to tighten A+ on this apexdesign - it is a very sturdy rack and only weighs 56lbs but the angle iron that holds the dumbbells is to tall for the 10lb dumbbells so they rock back and forth and the rack needs to be about 4in longer, it is a very tight fit to get all 10-50 hex on the rack if they made it 4in longer it would be a nice fit and you could probably even get a set of 55lb on thereall in all I am happy with the rack it looks nice and serves its purpose"
1,Ugly,"I connot say that I recomend this book, to anyone. It is a horrible display of character. Hasn't anyone heard of the ten commandments in this world? First of all thou shalt not covet. Don't be wanting something you can't have! Unlike Madame Bovary if you are living in a situation you don't like you learn to like it. Second, thou shalt not commit adultrey. Oh, wait that is exactly what she did. A couple of times. This book is ugly, and it shouldn't be read by those who are trying to lead a christian life."
5,wonderful boots,"I purchased these boots for myself. They are better looking in person. I received the bone suede. The boots are so soft. They are a brushed suede that looks and feels like leather. I was amazed at that.They zip up and leather lined, If you do not like extra pointy shoes this is not for you. I ordered a half size bizzer and they feel great.............."
3,Incomplete,"""Story of"" is more like the Table of Contents in that it is an inadequate anthology album. A mixture of songs from the band's late 60's/early 70's heyday and their early 80's ""comeback"" period, at only one dozen tunes, it misses plenty of highlights. For instance, the band's 1965 classic ""Go Now,"" is nowhere to be seen. Neither are such gems as ""Lovely to See You,"" ""Never Comes a Day,"" ""New Horizons,"" and ""Watching and Waiting,"" to name a few. There is nothing wrong with the songs that were included here, there just aren't nearly enough of them to make this a representative collection."
2,This Isn't The One You Want,"This is not completely a collection of MB masterpieces -- at least two are re-makes, and are not as good as the originals. I fear buying an MB ""greatest hits"" album now: Will I be getting the originals, or jazzed-up remakes ?"
3,Updating Legend Less Than Successful On This Moodies Set,"Originally released with different artwork in 1989, this Moody Blues collection contains most of the group's well known material, faithful to the original edits (""Tuesday Afternoon,"" ""Nights In White Satin"") It is docked one star, however, for two annoying remakes of ""Isn't Life Strange,"" and ""Question,"" done with a symphony orchestra. They add little to the originals but bombast (and marketing ploy; the group would tour several times throughout the 1990s with orchestras) and are better heard on either ""This Is The Moody Blues,"" the more recent ""Best of The Moody Blues,"" or the 2CD Moody Blues ""Anthology."""
4,Innocent fun,"Beanworld is the tale of the Beans, a clan of happy little... well, beans, who live in symbiosis with the Gran'ma'pa tree and the Hoi Polloi Ring Herd. There are occasional challenges, but Mr Spook and the Chow Sol'jers can generally handle things. Despite some menacing mysteries, it seems likely that things will continue to go well for the beans.The black and art is simple and quirky. The characters are straight forward. The plots are unsophisticated. It is naive, and fun, and a welcome relief from the dark, brooding styles that are so popular these days.Good, lightweight fun.E.M. Van Court"
3,3 stars for effort :) *the stones are coming! everyone hates neutrals!*,"i don't really get the need for most of the characters and descriptions, especially all the pheonixes. it is slow moving in parts, and the author puts an obvious effort to be poetic and very descriptive, but she leaves nothing to the imagination. there is a resemblence to many other fantasies, and to put it tactfully, it wasn't really much different from Eragon(not in the plotline, in the borrowed ideas), which had about the same amount of description. the riddles could be cut back a bit too, since i wasn't too interested in helping solve the question to where the pearls of ___ were. the only character that i felt for was Dei, and the rest weren't really my type. the beginning was interesting, especially the part where Janevra reflects on how hard life is for royals. i wasn't really into the book, but i know Janna Nickerson at least deserves three stars for working on it for five years."
4,Eye's of War,The book was great. I was really impressed by this novice writter and am looking forward to the next 2 books and anything she writes in the future.
3,Small lighters,"Lighters were smaller than I anticipated, and smaller than I wanted, but I can still use them. I may later order larger ones."
1,READ THE REVIEWS OR SUFFER LIKE ME,"First and foremost, THESE LIGHTERS ARE MINATURES. NOTHING in the description indicated that, either at the time of purchase and still not when I wrote this review. I should have read the only review posted before I purchased them. Now there are two out of two thumbs down votes. I would have given it a 0, but you have to choose at least one star. More than being small, they are also cheap brittle plastic: the flame adjustment broke off the first time i used it, and all the others are flemsy and will almost certainly do the same. Again, wish I had read the review. Save your money, these are crap."
1,MINIATURE WOULD BE A BETTER NAME,"So disappointed. I actually threw them away. Slim and light I was looking for, but 2 inches tall with an extremely hard to push trigger, they are impossible to light."
5,indiana jones hat,"Excellent quality, timely shipping and good customer service. The hat was a little large, so my husband called the company and they immediately shipped out sizing tape, which we had in about 2 days. The hat was very well made---the fabric was of excellent quality and the color was true to what we saw in the pictures. I'm sure my husband will be wearing this hat for a long time to come."
3,Overpriced,"It's an awesome hat, and my boyfriend loves it when I wear it with an ""Indy Style"" jacket, but I got the same damn hat at DISNEYLAND of all places for $50. And if it's cheaper at Disneyland, you know something's wrong with this picture.And yes, mine came with a certificate of authenticity."
2,Not worth the money,This is one expensive toy. I now have a better hat and I payed half the price. This one does not look like the one in the picture. I doesn't look like the one indy wore. It looks fake... Why is it so stiff? Is it possible to change the shape of this thing?

4,"The Proctors, Lincoln , Troy and State Theatres show the Cisco Kid in a double- feature The cause of childhood boredom","The 'Cisco Kid' movies with their endless repetitive adventures signify to me a child's learning the meaning of boredom. The Cisco Kid' was never the main - feature but rather the second-half of the double- bill. One wanted it to end but it went on and on and on. Cisco and Pancho encountering whatever bad guys they encountered, shooting and riding and going on as if they were Hispanic versions of Hopalong Cassidy or Lash Larue. 'When will it end?' and 'When will it end'?Total fluff."
1,AC/DC Back in Black,"This was NOT the actual singing album, but a bunch of people talking about the album like they were reviewing it. I thought that I had ordered the MUSIC album, but got this talking album instead!!! Grrrr!"
1,AC/DC: Back In Black (The World's Greatest Albums),The service getting it to me from the vendor was great.The album sucks.

3,Vibrasonic Mole Chaser,"Believe Molechaser deterred mole to another area of landscape; however, do not believe it covers 1/3 acre as advertised. Unless your yard is perfect square, will need more than 1 device. From my experience, appears lawn insect control, particularly slug killer, worked best."
3,Complaceny Reigns,"Sarah's latest album, which I eagerly anticipated, disappoints in most respects. It's no ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"", but I wasn't expecting another masterpiece like that. At the very least, given this is her first new album in six years, I expected it to be as good as or better than ""Surfacing"", yet it isn't even close. I doubt any single will be released other than the best track, ""Fallen"", and even that one feels like subpar Sarah. I am avoiding her current tour because I know most of the material will come from this average album. Where are the songs that resonate with every listen, such as ""Angel"", ""Building A Mystery"", or ""Sweet Surrender""? And why is Sarah's voice so quiet and wistful? This album doesn't make me want to light candles and relax, it makes me want to fall alseep or watch TV instead. Blah."
3,"She can do a lot better than this... buy ""Fumbling"" instead","I got this album as a birthday present. I had heard ""Fallen"" on the radio, and had thought it was so-so. The rest of the album is rather repetitive. Her voice is good enough on this album, but the music really dosen't do much for me. It is just like Enya... it's just pretty background music, with no purpose other than nice dinnertime sounds. And what is with the video for ""Fallen.""? I hate de bloody videoooooooo! It shows her naked in a bath, and that's not something an artist with substance like her does. I strongly recomend ""Fumbling towards Ecstacy"" instead. It has music with a purpose. Sarah is a great artist,she can do better than this."
5,Sarah is back!,"I have waited many years for Sarah to record a new cd and she didn't let us down.""Afterglow"" is not ""Surfacing"" or her other cds but it's still a great disc.Her voice is still haunting and beautiful.""Fallen"" is a great single.I'm so glad Sarah is back.This cd will not disappoint her fans."
3,........At Least There's A Nice Cover Photo,"Well, I listened to the album 2 weeks BEFORE it came out on VH1.com ....... and hmmmm..... it was a no go for me. She is a great writer, I love her previous work, but somehow these songs, one after the other just didn't click. The lyrics seemed un-inspired and didn't really flow well. And the music just kept going.....and going......and going like there was no tomorrow, oh my gosh.Listen before you buy it, download it on Kazaa.My fav track was the first single ""Fallen"" (Beautiful music video too eh?)"
2,Blah Blah Boredom,"I'll keep this breif, since I'll probably be slayed alive by all sorts of Sarah fans...I loved Fumbling...I loved Surfacing...I even loved Remixed...I did not love Afterglow.I'm not trying to be mean, it's just not a good album. I mean, the entire album stays on the same wave lenth, all the songs sound the same. In fact, Afterglow could be one long, song....there is no get up and go in Afterglow. I'd say it's all glowed out.This album brought to mind post birth depression. She should have waited another year or so and wrote something else. It depressed me, has no life to it and was weaker than anything she has ever done. It's a fluffy album with no substance, songs that sound like they belong on Fumbling and it left me bored.I waited seven years for Afterglow. I am content to wait another seven years until I listen to it again. Hopefully by then, it'll actually be good."
4,Wonderful,"I have to admit,,When I first listen to this cd, I felt a bit dissapointed...the songs all seemed soft and slow. Nothing seemed to be easily accessible, with the Fallen being an exception.. But after listening, I discovered more to this whole album. Yes, this is different than her previous, but that is good! Change is good, and these songs show a maturity that some artist never aquire. I hate buying a new cd from an artist I enjoy and it sounds the same. These songs are all beautiful and now I love this album. The title Afterglow is apt, for these songs leave a warm, quiet feeling in your soul. Don't give up on this one just because it takes some time to enjoy. Best songs, in my opinion, World on Fire, Stupid and Time. Though I could find something to love on each song."
2,"fluff, fluff, and more musical fluff","I don't enjoy writing bad reviews of the works of talented artists, but I can't lie. This album is a total letdown. The lyrics are good and perhaps more personal and darker than ever, but the music is pure fluff. This is Sarah pandering to the mainstream, Britney Spears-loving, musically mindless masses. Most of the songs sound the same and except for the lyrics are quite boring. I do, however, enjoy her single ""Fallen."" This song retains some of her former grace and originality, but I wouldn't waste my money on this album if I were you. It's nothing new. Her previous albums are much more superior, especially Surfacing."
3,"Okay, but not her best work","This CD is good. Her sound is unique and has been missed for the past 5 years since her last album. ""Afterglow"" is not her best work though. It's very mellow,sometimes too mellow. Lyrics are so-so. I would say borrow this CD but don't feel like you have to own it."
3,A little too quiet,"It has been a long time since Sarah McLachlan has released a new studio album. While ""Afterglow"" delivers for her mainstay fans, this album is a bit of a let-down. Almost every song is eerily quiet. ""Fumbling Toward Ecstacy"" & ""Surfacing"" have some upbeat tracks and deliver more of a variety. The best are the three singles: ""Fallen"", ""Stupid"", and ""World's On Fire"". ""Push"" also jumps out."
3,Listen to the after glow...,"I agree with some of the reviews, you grow to love this music after serveral plays. At first only a couple of songs strike you. The CD has wonderful sounds but the recording was not done well. The instruments become buried and not clean and separated. I wish the cd would be re-mastered. But the music itself is flowing and not forced. Sarah's voice is never better and lyrically interesting. Her vocals project such emotion it makes you dive right into yours. I find at first not liking this CD but now magically drawn to it as my favorite. spirit339a@netscape.net"
5,Glow Shines,"Sarah returns to us after her hiatus and is as good as ever. Four star album deserving of the fifth for such a strong offering after the lengthy abscence.Her mellifluous voice and sophisticated orchestration is consistently worth purchasing her albums. Afterglow contains the most mature and craftful lyrics of any Sarah album yet. The travails of her life are reflected throughout the album, particularly the maturity of lyrics.Highlights to note:'Fallen' is very good as the lead single.'Answer'- they lyrics read like a poem, phenomenal song.'Dirty Little Secret'- a haunting piece- song allows 'Afterglow' to fade out - maybe the best on the album."
5,sarah makes everything better,"i was like half of her fans who wasn't impressed with this album on first listen....and then it helped to form a bond between my friends and myself. we all realized we loved her and planned to see her during her afterglow tour. one night we decided pop in this cd to get used to it even though we weren't really that impressed with it. out of nowhere, it's like something magical happened and it found its way inside our hearts and minds. 'hey, this is pretty good!' 'hey, this is awesome!' 'why didn't i like this on first listen?'i think it's her best yet. 'train wreck' is super awesome with that great line: could your eyes/ like midnight fireflies/ light up the trenches where my heart lies? yes, yes they can. anything for you, sarah.it's soooooo good. she is my favorite singer-songwriter and i love what she did here. she makes everything better."
3,"S.M. fans surely love it, why don't I ?!","I only listen to half of the album ! I hate myself.. I do love Sarah's previous works SO MUCH (I got each and every cd she has released).. is there something wrong with me ?!I think the album is much more like Surfacing and less like FTE (which is her best album in my opinion).. regarding melody, u could almost match some pairs of afterglow and Surfacing's songs, the less upbeat songs are sort of boring *hides behind sofa*. lyrics are still dark and mysterious.. charming. generally, a change is desperately needed.However, SHE SHINES WITH A MASTERPIECE CALLED ""TIME"". I guess it's enough a good reason to get the album."
2,Does not have the same power as the other albums.,I have been listening to the album for over a week hoping to find something more but it fails to evoke the emotional response of her previous releases. I still like some the songs but I wouldn't recommend this album to someone new to Sarah. Get Fumbling instead.
3,Lacking...,"This CD is missing something...""Fallen"" is excellent. However, all of the other songs on the album end up sounding the same or reminding me of her past songs. After years of waiting, I'm not floored with this release, as I was hoping I would be...but despite its faults, I do appreciate it...One thing's for certain, it's better than anything out there right now...but not SM's best."
2,"The Bad News, Then the Good","For McLachlan's zealously orthodox fan brigade who forbid even suggestions of heresy, allow me to save you further trouble:0 of Billions found the following review helpful:Bad news is that Afterglow doesn't come close to being McLachlan's best work. Nothing in this album hooks on first play; repeated plays are uninspiring. Afterglow is flat--in spots, downright Enya-esque--and it creates a McLachlan-craving it isn't able to satisfy (pop another McLachlan CD into the player to get the job done).Good news is that some of the time, even the gods are entitled to be less than brilliant. Now that McLachlan has released a mediocre record, she can go back to being brilliant again. Until then, take heart: The afterglow is never as fun and interesting as the fumbling and the surfacing...which may have been McLachlan's point."
1,"Highly anticipated, but unfortunately disapointed","After 6 years of wondering when Sarah McLachlan was going to have another album, I was very happy to hear about her release of Afterglow.I felt that her previous album and popular songs off of Surfacing would be a tough act to follow, but if anyone could do it, this master of words and music could.After listening to the entire CD, I was amazingly disappointed. I failed to find anything but songs that basically sounded alike with no variety.One thought came to mind. Good elevator music but that's about it. And to think, I was previously ready to put her in the ranks with Joni Mitchell.Sarah failed with this one. Perhaps (and I hope), the next album will be better. She has written and performed some great music, but not on this album.Anyone want to buy a slightly used CD?I suggest holding off buying the CD and borrowing it from a friend first and make up your own mind."
2,got art?,"Can someone tell me where all the original and amazing art has gone because we need to get it back!! Two days before being stunned by the mediocracy of this cd, I sat stunned by the droning 3rd Matrix movie. So much potential from both Sarah M. (Fumbling Towards Ectasy) and the Wachowski bros. (Matrix 1) and such milquetoast! I preordered the latest Sarah M. cd because I love her work so much. Unfortunately this cd all sounds the same, with no distinctness anywhere except Fallen and Answer. The rest of the songs don't evoke any feelings other than mourning for the original, evocative art that Sarah M. is beyond capable of."
4,"This is good, but......","This is very sweet, mellow music. but someone please tell me.....are the radio edit and album version of ""World On Fire"" different...? I heard it on the radio and it sounded faster, more background effects, and just plain....BETTER. Does anyone know...? I was kind of surprised when I heard the album version, which seems much slower and more raw."
1,The Manitee returns...,"The Manitee (Sarah M's nickname, as her fans know) releases another cd that sounds like the last one. too slick and poppy. Better luck next time, Manitee."
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I was sorry I spent the money. After hearing that Afterglow was going to be released soon, I waited with anticipation, only to be disappointed with the mundaneness of the album, the lyrics and the music."
2,A disappointment for a true fan,"I'm one of those fans that jumps at any new album by Sarah (or Tori for that matter) but consider this one close to a waste. The album flows so much from one song to another that I can barely tell when one starts and another stops. All the songs are ok, but it's overall its lackluster to fans who love her more up-beat early albums, remixes or B-sides. If you're just getting into Sarah from her radio playlist, look for her Rarities, Bsides and other stuff album instead-- it's fabulous."
3,not as good as mirrorball,sarah mclachlan is from one of my favorite artists. i was dissapointed with afterglow. her earlier album 'mirrorball' is probably the best album i have ever had. her songs in afterglow are like Dido type songs. i like dido but i think sarah mclachlans songs are far more sophtisticated than hers. i hope her next album will be more powerfull than this last one.
2,Bad...,"True Sarah fans who love her music so deeply would be very disapointed. It has some nice songs, such as Fallen, Stupid and Time but the rest are just a long trail of blahhhhhhhhhhh in one tune. This is not to Sarah's standards, which is very high. This cd is nothing compared to her previous ones... she is also too 'happy' in this cd. Nothing truely special and has not created any creative songs here. Sarah is a truely amazing artist and this cd is disapointing!"
2,"Dull, dull, dull","I'm not a huge Sarah fan by any means but I quite enjoy her older work....songs like Into the Fire and Possession. Her latest cd, ""Afterglow"" lacks spark and passion. The first single, ""Fallen"" is a put me to sleeper. Not her finest work by any means."
3,After Lilith Fair,"Afterglow is the kind of album that grows on you slowly, but surely after listening to it over and over... I listened to it for the first time and found that I immediately enjoyed ""Fallen,"" ""Push,"" ""Perfect Girl,"" and ""Drifting."" ""Stupid"" took some time to work on me, but finally pushed its way into being one of my favorite songs. I was introduced to Sarah after her Surfacing album, which I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. After her 5-year hiatus, I didn't know what to expect from her new album, but she is as melancholy as ever (an element in her songwriting which I've always enjoyed), yet still quite poignant. Those who enjoy Surfacing's haunting, melancholy mood will enjoy Afterglow. However, if you're looking for something upbeat or inspiring, this album isn't for you. I haven't heard Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, but would definitely recommend Surfacing before Afterflow."
4,Excellent as always,"As always, Sarah delivers powerful songs sung with honesty and conviction. It's wonderful to hear her make such a strong come-back after so many years.The only good thing about her absence from the scene is that I was forced to seek out and discover so many other, similar up and coming artists like Hungry Lucy, Delerium, Kirsty Thirsk and Harland.So great to hear from Sarah again though! Let's hope a tour is not far behind!"
2,"A low rating, coming from a huge fan","As a borderline-obsessive Sarah McLachlan fan, I was thrilled when I got news that she had put out an album after a five year absence from the industry (besides some work on soundtracks). But upon listening to the album, I was nothing but disappointed. Fallen and a couple of other songs have catchy tunes, but the lyrics are nothing compared to her past work. Compare the lyrics from any song on Afterglow to songs off Surfacing, Fumbling or either of her two early albums (Touch, Solace) and you'll see what I mean. The songs in Afterglow lack the subtlety and imagery that made her past work so brilliant and captivating. Furthermore, her voice does not get the attention it deserves in the album, just about caged by the instrumental parts in the songs. If one is looking for some catchy soft pop, Afterglow is not a bad place to go. But for deeper music that can one can actually identify with, Sarah's earlier stuff is unparalleled."
4,"A lovely, nice CD","I like ""Afterglow"" a lot; you will find Sarah's unique sound; for me, each song have a texture, being the favourites ""Push"" (I think of my daughter when I hear it) and ""Afterglow"", although is a very enjoyable record overall.I don't give it 5 stars because no Sarah's record match hers ""Fumbling..."" and ""Surfacing"", but I'm sure you will enjoy it."
5,A counter to all those faulting every post-Fumbling Towards Ecstasy release,"I'm tired of reading reviews comparing her work now to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Fumbling was more than a decade ago. A lot has happened in her life since then. For one thing, she's a whole lot richer than she was back then. From what I can tell, she has a great relationship with her husband, Ashwin Sood. They've recently had a baby girl. As much as I love FTE, which was of great comfort to me in my teenage angst years, we're all supposed to be different now--older, wiser, calmer. I don't expect and most certainly don't want Sarah to be putting records out with content such as that found in FTE in this chapter in her life."
1,Sarah has Fallen,"Sarah's latest album ""Afterglow"" is one of 2003's worst albums. There is no good reason to buy this album. Don't be fooled by the first single ""Fallen"", which might give the illusion that this album is worth anything. There is only 2 decent songs on this 10 song album: Fallen and Stupid. Ladies and Gentlemen do yourselves a favor and save your money."
3,A Career in Danger,"It is so problematic to follow early success, because the weatlh of material and experience you build leading to your first CD is so great. And so Sarah's angst, pleading, soulful sincereity that rang from her early work is now growing faint.The result is an honest effort that is falling short. Ths album is packaged and sanitized, lacking in depth and vision. Its not exactly Muzak, but it also not the Sarah we know and love..."
2,downward slope,"Sarah is heading steadily downhill. Her first album, Touch, wasn't that great, but it showed a glimpse of greater things to come. Solace, the second, showed her beginning to really take form in her songwriting, which fully blossomed in Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. FTE is probably one of my absolute favorite albums ever, and I will always love Sarah for it. But Surfacing, the next album, began to show a dilution in her potency, leading us to this album, Afterglow. Pain creates great art, and I don't think Sarah wants for much of anything anymore, leaving the songs on Afterglow as nothing more than what anyone else could have done. If you want to hear Sarah Mclachlan, listen to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, Solace, or her B-Sides. Leave the rest to her radio babies."
4,Haunting and Beautiful,"I am rather new to Sarah, having become a fan over the summer after hearing the AMAZING song ""Fear,"" and I am very pleased with this album. It's haunting and beautiful. Sarah is a wonderful songwriter whose music will bring tears to your eyes. Too bad the album has only ten songs! ""Fallen"" and ""Perfect Girl"" are my favorites; buy ""Afterglow"" for those songs alone. A nice addition to any music collection."
2,BEEF JERKY,"Same old thing, slightly different flavah - teriyaki, smoked, original. Copied melodies from last album and less exciting. It is time to go to the woods with acoustic this spring, then maybe she can come up with something worthwhile and unboring."
1,"Blah, blah, blah","This album is a big disappointment. I'm a real fan of Sarah, and have been for years. Afterglow is boring, directionless, and self abosorbed."
3,so much of it sounds the same,"I really wanted to like this album. I am not moved by it; I don't love it and I'm disappointed with it. There are only one or two songs that particularly stand out to me. The rest blend together way too much.So many of the sounds are the same - the piano, the tempo, the ""dreamy"" guitars... I swear it almost put me to sleep on a long road trip. I swore off listening to it for several months. Having put it back on in my car (dangerous, yes, I know - considering the road trip) for several rotations of listening to the words, I still remain unimpressed. For me, everything between tracks 1 and 10 are filler. Train Wreck is the next closest song to stand out, but so many of the songs just feel like filler.I don't feel that she was particularly inspired when it came to composition, if she was for the lyrics."
2,Burnt out?,"Ho-hum. Not as interesting as Solace and not as lushly orchestrated as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Afterglow is just... well, boring. Better title: ""somnabulent."""
4,Finally!,"Have been waiting on this one for some time. Sarah's other CD's were well worn out in my collection. I was THRILLED that she finally came out with another album. A bit hesitant as I first popped it in I found myself wondering if it would measure up to her other albums. I was and am not disappointed. While not as strong as Fumbling, it still delivers. Her voice is as soothing as it always was, the music strikes that special chord as the others. This is an artist that never disappoints - thank you Sarah! Please don't stay away so long again - we need your music in a world that is fraught with soulless angry music."
1,A Little Boring,"I never enjoyed Sarah's music. She is a pitiful musician and is in my opinion only 'average'. Her new C-D is one of her typical depressing and boring albums. I would not reccomend this to anyone, except those who like very slow, flat music. After a few times though, you will tire from it completely. This is my opinion to those who spend their time reading this, and if yours is different and you decide to buy this than good for you!"
1,Isn't she dead yet!?,"Is this the same Sarah McLauchlan that sucked last time I bought a cd of hers!? I believe so. This is pathetic. She's got the looks, not the voice. She needs to just get a job at Maximus and get it over with. Either go into Playboy or stop wasting my time!"
1,this calypso queen should retire,"the tambourines , the uptempo, the cimballs are all lame. her voice is not good anymore, and shes cheap with 30 minutes of music on the cd. that why peeps dont like pay full price anymore for half a cd.you wouldn't of mine if it was good but its awefull sound on my head. my dog using it as a frisbee, and i as wine glass coaster.she's lost the reigning title of calypso queen."
1,tired and formulaic,"Like some other reviewers, this is my least favourite Sarah McLachlan album. It sounds like its time for Sarah to break free from partner/producer Pierre Marchand. They've made some beautiful music together over the years but this is a retread."
2,Even lower rating...,"After listening some more to this album, I realize that ""Fallen"" is the only song that sort-of measures up to the previous standards, but even so, the chorus is filled with trite lyrics that frankly sound embarassing! I'm shocked that Sarah allowed Marchand to bury her voice underneath all that Wall-of-Sound effects, since her voice is as good as ever. The biggest problem of course is no edge in the songs, trite lyrics. Fumbling was devastating album, Surfacing a bit less so but still had punch.Afterglow is simply product, nothing else."
3,Sarah McLauglin,"Very nice, but not what I expected. It is necessary to read the lyrics to understand."
3,Consider it a CD single...,"Fallen is a great track in the tradition of the albums that came before it. The rest of the album, however, runs together like 30 minutes of adlib based on the style of ""Angel"". That wasn't my favorite track and 30 minutes of it, each minute seemingly indistinguishable from the the next, isn't great.Sarah McLachlan remains the penultimate female vocalist and has clearly in the past demonstrated superior songwriting talent. At the current rate of one ablbum every six years, however, it looks like we'll be 12 years between great albums."
4,Welcome back Sarah,"With ""Afterglow,"" Sarah McLachlan's newest disc in five years, she returns to the sophisticated songwriting and poignant melodies of her earlier work. The end result is a satisfying album sure to please even the most sceptical of Sarah fans. The best tracks on the album, ""Fallen"" and ""Answer,"" sound like they could have been b-sides from her earlier album ""Surfacing,"" and while the new release pales in comparison to previous releases (especially Fumbling Towards Ecstacy), it still makes for a relaxing night of quality music. Sarah's songwriting skills are as sharp as ever, and the production is as beautiful as anything she's released. Reccomended for every Sarah fan."
3,Short and pretty much like the slow surfacing songs,"I like this CD, but its just not what I expected after 5 or 6 years of gettin ready for it to come out. Its only about 40 mins long. Every song songs about like the last one (Similar beat, similar tone, similar vocals, etc). Theres not really that much emotion in most of the tracks. Sort of depressing sounding. Don't get me wrong, I am really glad to have a new Sarah CD in my 'possesion'. I just wish it had a little more mysterious deeper feeling with more emotion, Kind of like Building a Mystery, or Witness, or Fumbling."
4,Another wonderful album!,"Sarah McLachlan is one of my favorite artists and this album provides more of her signature style. An incredibly beautiful voice, haunting melodies, and emotional lyrics mark this as another wonderful album!"
5,Another great CD from Sarah McLachlan,I particularly enjoyed this CD - as inspired an endeavor as Mirrorball.
4,the long-awaited Afterglow,"I gave this album to my sister for Xmas, as she's a big Sarah McLachlan fan. I also had a listen to it. I think the other album is better, but this is still a good effort that won't disappoint most fans. Also recommended: Fiona Apple or Tori Amos.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
3,not too bad,"Its great to hear from Sarah again. I love the 1st song fallen! The rest of the CD is still growing on me. I don't think it is as good as Surfacing, but its pretty damn close. I would recommend this CD to Sarah fans."
3,"Resonates with the chest, but negative reviews have merit","This review is a revision after dozens of listens.I'll say that I'm happy to own this album, but it hasn't grown on me as I thought it would. I rarely bring it out to listen to. When I do, however, it is like having an old familiar friend over--such is Sarah's warm voice.The album has her patented darkly romantic tone that will be the accompaniment to many intimate moments--small candlelit dinner parties, make out sessions. However, as for straight listening, I will say it is a bit of a disappointment because none of the songs are completely distinctive. I'm still having trouble remembering which songs are which, and what message/mood is from each one. After reading most of the reviews, take note that there is a good mix of opinion--and this is reflected accurately in an album that is decent, but not great.I've moved this from 4 stars to 3."
4,"Good follow up to Surfacing, completly different chemistry!","Sarah has this voice that instantly melts one into a simmering goo! I love her, It's that simple. There are some great tracks on this cd, it' still growing on me. There is less guitar ""effects"" on ""Afterglow"" than ""Surfacing"". Its more of a stripped down production. One major part is noticably missing, No Camille Henderson! What happened there? ""Afterglow"" hosts a different band and a whole different chemistry between the players. I was looking forward to the Camille/Sarah harmonies...oh well, not to be. Hopefully Camille will tour with the band on the next tour. For those of you looking for a repeat of ""Surfacing"", It's not this cd. If you want to hear a more honest, basic version of what Sarah can do then this is a must! I agree with other reviewers that It's good to have Sarah back! We missed you girl!"
4,Great Album!!,"Its great to hear from Sarah after 6 years.....The songs on this album display her capabilities and her ability to touch all of us. It doesn't quite stand up to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, which is, to me, Sarah at her best. I got that album in 94, and I have never stoped listening to it!Definitely glad that's she's back!@!!!"
3,"well, it is sarah's voice afterall","Well, a little disappointing. It's a great CD, but just an OK sarah mclachlan cd. The cd is almost over before you even start. before you know it, you're hearing ""fallen"" again. not as good as past efforts, but does have it's moments. ps- how funny is it with the reviews that review each song individually!?! gotta love that, won't find that here."
4,Not bad.,"Not nearly as good as Surfacing but I enjoyed the album nevertheless. The album features a pleasant collection of tracks that follow her style and tone. It's no masterpiece, but if you like her voice, you'll be pleased with this album."
5,Sarah McLachlan Reloaded,"After years of absence focusing on her personal life (new child and marriage) and some much needed rest after her last commercial album and concert tours like Lilith Fair, Sarah delights us with her latest offering. Afterglow somehow seems to radiate the depths of her maturity found from those experiences. I have always loved her poetic and cogitative lyrics in her previous albums and she had not disappointed in Afterglow. All the tracks display a freshness of artistry while maintaining the distinct Sarah McLachlan sound her fans have come to love throughout the years. A must addition to your music library."
3,"Good CD, but Too Short","The wait for Sarah McLachlan's latest release is over. Although her heavenly album, ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,"" is considered the gold standard, there are a few tracks on this album that are good. As a fan before Fumbling, her sound and lyrics morph and shape themselves by (what it seems) her life experiences like any other artist. This is no different. Sparse and simple, this album has a ""take it or leave it""-as-it-is approach. Not entirely bad or entirely great, but worth a spot in your CD collection."
3,Still a Sarah fan,"It's been 5 whole years since her last album and I couldn't wait for her new album. Now that I've heard it (over and over again) I can say that I like it but not as much as Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. There are only 9 songs on the album which is a little dissapointing, but I like five of 'em...Fallen, Stupid, World on Fire, Train Wreck (kinda reminds me of a Seal song), and Push."
5,Still shining.,"Sarah McLachlan's new album was well worth the 6 year wait. It's brilliant. You never really know how much you miss someone until you're exposed to their music again. It's timeless and the music on this album is wonderfully done. I highly recommend it. From the defiant rant in ""Stupid"" to the soft heavenly tones of ""Push"" and ""Dirty Little Secret,"" this album was a non-skip masterpiece. One of the best albums of the year."
5,Five year and she is back!,"I have been following Sarah Mclachlan since I heard the cd Solace and have been hooked in and kept me returning to her beautiful voice.This cd is just another showing of her ability. It's an incredible mix of heart felt, more personal than ever sounds and melodies. After such emotional times in her life such as the death of her mother and the birth of her daughter, this cd is a reflection of her emotions and a porthole into her soul. A very impressive collection!!Sarah is an artist that writes from her soul and experiences. These mellow songs will keep you warm and tells the tales of hope and death and life. I would highly recommend this to all."
3,"Pretty, but ... no edge","We've got a few of Sarah's CDs. We were really looking forward to this. It's pleasant enough, but ... well, she used to sing & write as though her life depended on it. There was an edge. No longer."
4,Better with repeat listenings...,"When I first popped this CD in I was disappointed. Five years for this? and from someone I respect as much as Sarah? But I was willing to listen again because I felt I owed Sarah that much...and this album got several magnitudes better. ""Perfect Girl"" sounds like it could've been off of F.T.E., and ""Answer"" is just gorgeous. Though I think there will always be some songs on here I don't like that much (""World on Fire,"" ""Train Wreck""), and it's certainly not as strong of an album as F.T.E., it's definitely worth a listen and gets better with repeat listening.This album is subtler than her previous work, which I think is part of why it's been getting weak reviews. But the mellowness appeals to me. It's not the emotional abyss of the others either, but certainly enjoyable."
1,Shoot the Producer,"I fell in love with Sarah McLachlan... uhh, with Sarah McLachlan's voice... when I saw and heard her on daytime TV singing songs from Afterglow and accompanying herself on piano and guitar. The CD is a shocking disappointment. The producer seems to have thrown every instrument made plus some unidentifiable sounds into the mix, obscuring what might have been a good listen. I feel cheated and unless she goes unplugged next time, Sarah's off my list."
2,Dissapointed after waiting so long,"So after what, 6 years of waiting you get really excited when an artist you love comes out with a new alblum. Well I had heard it was ""nothing new"" and ""the same old Sarah"" but to me its not, its nothing near as good as weve heard before. One song sounds like the next and the next. Nothing stands out and its all a blur of a cd.I wish I could love it since I loved her last cd so much and it has been such a long time but I just cant.Youll end up buying it anyway if your a Sarah fan and come to your own conclusion but dont get to excited."
2,Uninspired,All the songs sound the same and all the songs sound like the same material she's done before. She sounds bored and you will feel bored because there's not much territory here that hasn't been covered in the past and was covered better as well.
3,AFTERGLOW REVIEW,"I purchase ""Afterglow"" and I love the album...My favorite songs are ""Stupid"",""Time"",""Fallen"" and ""Answer""...I played the album like a hundred times after listening to Sara.. I put in my Christmas music. I turn on ""One Wish"" Whitney Houston Christmas album, and let me tell it definately the best christmas album I've heard in along time..She does a great job. My favorites are ""Joy To The World"", ""Who Would Imagine A King"", ""Little Drummer Boy"", and ""O Holy Night""...I would definately recommend both of these album to anyone who loves good music."
1,God stop already!,Ok so Sarah had 2 wonderful albums (Solace and FTE)...let's just deal with that already. Now it's a matter of the same old songs reguratated. Falling is great and Push is great. But shame on me for paying $13.99 for 2 good songs and the rest fillers.Note to musicians everywhere - This is why we download MP3s. Here is a perfect example of a honest music buying person paying for crap.
1,disappointing,"I have enjoyed Sarah's music for some years and was fortunate enough to see her in her Lilith Fair days. She is a stellar musician and sings songs with heart. However, I didn't find any of that on this CD. I found this depressing and boring. To her credit, it sounds from the songs as though she has had a lot of conflict and chaos in her life during her 5 year hiatus and perhaps this hindered her creativity and spirit. I will still look forward to her next CD, but can't recommend this one."
5,Fabulously beautiful -- Listen with headphones for sure!!!,"I am a recent Sarah fan. I lucked out and saw her in concert at Baltimore's Lyric Opera house on Dec 17 -- alternately playing a baby grand piano and her guitar. Pure and unadulterated beauty!!! Few artists express themselves as passionately as this one, in person and in recordings. Now that I have purchased ALL of her albums and listened to them all repeatedly, I see that Afterglow is more ""reserved"" perhaps, than others. Her music has matured as she has, and I think it's a lovely and eloquent album, and best listened to alone through good headphones. Thank you, Ms. McLachlan!"
3,I TOLD YOU SO....,"Afterglow, is the return of Sarah McLachlan to music after more than 4 years of vacation. One thing is unmistakeble, McLachlan's has an angel voice, it's just atmospheric. But with ""Afterglow"" it seems she's still trapped in 1998, there is no innovation on this album, she could easily have fitted all the tracks in ""Surfacing"", that's why some people don't playe dit at radio, ""Fallen"" sounded like Sarah's all released hits. Only with different lyrics, it's obvious that McLachlan paid attention to the old said ""stick to the formula"", but somehow after two superb album's, the third is enough, I wanted to hear a new venue like Jewel's 0304, ok she got little to pop-new wave, but at least she tried, but this could be put on the cd, along with Sarah's previous two albums, and you wouldn't tell wich song is newer than the other, if your not a fan. So this album is in no way bad, is just the same stuff as always, I think that it's why this album hasn't make that much buzz."
3,"Not her best, but not as bad as some reviews say...","""Fumbling towards ecstasy"" and ""Surfacing"" were both devastating albums. This one less so, but has more plush than some reviews say. While it lacks the flat-out brilliance of FTE or Surfacing, it is still a beautiful album. Let us not be biased and forget to highlight the flaws of the album. Some of the songwriting can be a little repitive (count how many times the themes of fire, water, and ice come up)but this is overshadowed by her voice. Overall, I give this a 3.5(c'mon amazon, start letting us review that way.) It's not as good as past albums, but not as bad as some say."
2,A great disappointment,"Thia ahould have been titled ""Stumbling Towards Mediocrity"". Imcomparibly inferior to all of her previous work."
3,Mellow,"Afterglow continues on in an even more mellow tone than Surfacing. Overall the CD is good, but not as good as Fumbling. There is no edge or humor to any of the music. Fallen is probably the strongest song, but I prefer Stupid, Train Wreck and Push."
4,Super Sarah-Fan,"I have now been listening to AFTERGLOW for 3 days and it has completely grown on me! I was trepidacious after such amazing past efforts produced the likes of MIRRORBALL & FUMBLING......... The lyrics and music sound like the same ol' Sarah, but thats what I was hoping for, and that's what I got. I recommend it to any and all who have ever like Sarah's style and hauntingly beautiful voice.--ENJOY!"
4,Good Enough,"How can you not love Sarah? She is gorgeous, and so is her voice. Was this album worth the wait? Almost. I would have liked to see some creative growth, but like the other alt-chanteuses like Loreena McKennitt and Enya, she seems comfortable continuing to create breathy, ethereal tunes. And like them, she does it so well. Melodically and lyrically, she has still to top Fumbling Toward Ecstasy, one of the great albums of the 90's. But this album is growing on me with each listen. ""Fallen"", of course, is the high-profile song, but ""Stupid"", ""Train Wreck"" and ""Time"" are also worthy of airplay. All in all, another solid effort."
2,It really is just an Afterglow...,"The other two Sarah McLaughlan CD's were much different; each song on them seemed to be one that got stuck in your head. They all had wonderful, deep, original lyrics sung with an amazing voice. Afterglow is simply awful in comparison. The only song that really jumps out at you like the old ones is 'Fallen' - the rest is, plainly put, filler. Not only are the lyrics less original (dealing a lot more with the industry standards of 'love' and 'love you, but can't let go' and maybe a little more of that overdone 'love' stuff) but a lot of the vocals seem like a monotone in comparison to her other songs; and even those are overshadowed by a too-loud piano track and many useless sound effects.Maybe it grows on you after a while, but I wouldn't know. I haven't listened to it enough if that's the case. The best word to describe it would have to be overproduced."
5,Pretty music.,"This is the only cd of Sarah's that I have purchased. I'm glad I did. It is melancholy at times, but overall is a good music cd."
4,Nice and Slow and Easy Listening,"This CD is lovely, the title is perfect for the combination of songs performed here. It truly is a great buy!"
4,Very Good,"I have been listening to Sarah since 1998 and enjoy her music very much. This is very good stuff. Mellow, haughting music. A good CD."
5,AFTERGLOW=EXCELLENT!,You should base you decision as to whether or not you want to buy this CD on the 268 persons who gave AFTERGLOW 5 stars. Especially those who went into great detail. That is all I have to say. The previous 5 star reviewers have said it for me. What more could I possibly say? AFTERGLOW IS A GREAT CD!!! DON'T PASS IT BY.
4,Beautiful as ever,Afterglow is exceptional. Sarah has a beautiful voice and is one of the very best Jazz vocalists. This album is very good and a great pleasure to listen to.
2,A snoozer....,"I have one word to describe this CD - BORING!!! Come on, Sarah, stretch a little. Use the full range of those gorgeous pipes of yours!!! I found this CD to lack the intricacies and angst of earlier works. Easy listening for those who want background music, but nothing you can get your teeth into. Similar rhythms, consistent vocal ranges, and lackluster lyrics make this one a snoozer."
3,"Good CD, but...","This is a decent CD, and McLachlan's voice sounds as great as ever. But don't expect to hear the Sarah McLachlan who gave us ""Possession"" and ""Building a Mystery"". The rough edges are gone and McLachlan's long slide from rock to adult contemporary is now complete. I hate to even use this word, but honestly, ""Celine"" comes to mind at times. The tracks are slow piano numbers, and having listened to this CD three or four times now, the songs still mostly sound the same. If you like the most mellow tracks from her previous CDs, you'll love this CD. But those of us who prefered McLachlan's edgier songs will mourn the transformation."
3,5 years too long,"- ""Fumbling"" is still her best work- ""Surfacing"" is a runner up- ""Afterglow"" is very slow moving, perhaps often boring- Not her best work, not even comparable- ""Fallen"" is the chosen strong song- Vocal, as always...(perfect)- Lyrical content: shallow, cliché, underachieved- Production is top notch- Performances were top notch- Worth purchasing if a fan of hers- Big disappointment for me personally.<OTHER RECOMMENDED ALBUMS SIMILAR-GENRA WORTH PURCHACING>* A Rush of Blood to the Head* Jagged Little Pill* Fallen From Grace* The Very Best of Sheryl Crow* Life for Rent"
2,Disappointing,"I have enjoyed Sarah McLachlan's other title's tremendously, playing them over and over even to this day. After hearing the first track on the radio (and liking it) I anxiously awaited to hear this new album and was completely disappointed. I thought the songs were too slow and boring. Usually, her music is more varied, but this was just all the same thing over and over."
5,Fair Lilith is still the queen...,"Every time Sarah puts out a classic album I wonder how the heck she can ever hope to follow it. Yet every time, she does. Stylistically, Afterglow differs only slightly from her previous albums, yet it is distinct and original, and unmistakably Sarah.While this a whole album of great songs, I latched onto certain pieces first time through - Fallen, Stupid, Train Wreck, Push and Time above all. On subsequent listenings, the rest of the songs also came on board.Great songs, great cover and photos. Has she ever looked more beautiful? I sincerely doubt it.In an industry full of posers and gimmick bands, this is yet another breath of fresh air from the queen herself."
3,Nothing special,"Having purchased all of Sarah's previous albums, Afterglow is definitely the weakest of them all. Other then ""Falling"" none of the other songs are really in the same league. I was expecting better. If you're new to Sarah McLachlan, I recommend purchasing ""Mirrorball"" first, as I feel it is the best compilation of her songs."
2,Solid effort from Sarah...but a letdown,"I loved Surfacing, so I really looked forward to Sarah's new release, especially given the six years between Surfacing and Afterglow. My first impression is that Afterglow is good, but forgettable. Afterglow does not have the originality, hit songs, or great arranging found on Surfacing. I'm dissapointed because I wanted to be blown away by a great recording, but Afterglow is no more than good. My biggest complaint: The tracks lack diversity and creativity compared to what we know she can do. Her lyric writing also is not as good in comparision to previous CDs. I feel Afterglow lacks the creative spark that typifies her great songs of the past."
4,Big Fan of McLachlan,"I am a huge fan of Sarah McLachlan and was so excited to get another album of hers. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I feel like it still can not compare to her old albums with classics such as Sweet Surrender, Building a Mystery, I Will Remember You, etc. However, it is still a very solid album with beautiful songs (my favourites being Fallen, Stupid and Train Wreck). I think at first you feel a little disappointed but as you listen more and more to the album it really grows on you. Afterglow is also one of those albums where you can continue to listen to for a long time without getting bored of it. Fans of McLachlan will not be disappointed and it's clear that she will continue to attract fans both old and new."
2,How about some rousing Sousa tunes!,"A personal quirk of mine is to read album credits. In this latest offering the artist acknowledges her husband & daughter in glowing terms.SO WHY NOT SOME UPLIFTING TUNES?Jeez, if this CD had a few more of the typical SM fair of ""I'm just a mixed up, confused, heart-broken, relationship-scarred woman trying not to screw up my life further"" I would have tossed it out. It's been a while since I actually wished an album would end. Thank goodness this one was a tad over 40 minutes.Now if my sister will accept this CD as a Christmas present & not notice that it's been opened..."
1,I wish we were still waiting . . .,"on her new CD that is. I'm so disappointed in this CD. The only song I may listen to again is Fallen. The rest are boring, sound to much alike. I want my money back."
4,"some catchy songs, but a little samey","I am a huge Sarah fan, after Lilth fair I thought, wow here is a gal to follow and buy more of her music. So after 5 years she puts out Afterglow which I was expecting to be really really novel and new..unfortunately towards the end of the CD the songs all merge into one. Fallen, World on Fire, Stupid...excellent songs...however not much to say about the rest.Her Remixes are great...which the CD comes with as part of Bandwith service, you logon and when played on PC there are some nice features associated with it.All in all a little like her last effort but not much emotion or umph to this effort, probably sold out a little with the commericial success of her past."
2,Coma Time,"Warning: This album can induce a coma state. A dreadful listening experience, but I did recover, and am doing fine, thanks."
2,disappointing ...,"I have been a huge Sarah fan for years, but i was hugely disappointed by this album. It has a few good songs, but it seems as if this is her first album, with lyrics that strive to be meaningful but end up just sounding campy. I think Sarah has become pretnetious over the years and believes all words she sins are poetry."
1,Afterglow~ Sarah McLachlan,"OMG, I can't believe that I waited 5 years for this. I wish I could rate it less than a star, because I think Sarah McLachlan should be paying me to listen to this CD. I have played it more than 6 times, and can't remember any of the songs on it! To call them blah is an understatement. I'm surprised I haven't fallen alseep at the wheel of my car while listening to it! My significant other remarked ""A great voice wasted on boring songs...turn it off, it's sucking the life out of me!"" I would try to sell it on half.com, but it just doesn't seem fair to put someone else through this agony. Sarah, what HAPPENED to you???"
2,Tragic Sense of Life,"This was a very difficult read for me. Of course, the book was written n 1912 so the numerous references to other authors, etc. , were for the most part meaningless to me. Miquel de Unamuno was obviously a highly intelligent man, but I could not get a grasp on what he was trying to say to his readers. Perhaps the clearest thing he said was that life is contradictory. This book is very abstract and I was somewhat disappointed by it, but nevertheless I will probably try to re-read it in the future.Thank you, Amazon, for offering this book and for great service on your shipping!"
4,Leadsinger is great for parties.,Leadsinger is fun for all and really increases the energy level of a get together. The accompanying music is midi type and not the original instrumentation.
2,Intriguing journey bogs down in the details,"The author is a gifted writer. He is very observant and skilled in describing his surroundings. This strength, however, is also his downfall. He paints a word picture of nearly every situation he encountered--often in excrutiating detail. Frankly, it begins to get tedious. In addition, while I generally enjoy tales this this one, I found it hard to connect with him. There's a detached, flat affect quality to his writing. He's not passionate, just obsessed. I tried to like him and feel the power of his journey, but just couldn't get excited about it."
1,Definitely not worth buying now,"This book wasn't great even when it came out, but back then we had no idea what Lunars, Dragon-Blooded, Sidereals, spirits, etc, could do, so we bought it anyway. Now, the vast majority of the information in this book has been retconned, and what hasn't been retconned has been published elsewhere, except for the spirit Charms, which were supposed to be published in ""Games of Divinity"" but were left out due to typical White Wolf publishing confusion. However, even those are available free to download on the White Wolf website (under ""Games of Divinity Appendix""), so you have absolutely no reason to spend money on this book. Don't."
4,Great book,"This book is a great guide for those who are interested in spiritual growth. It also helps the reader to discover erroneous behavior patterns that prevent him/her from achieving spiritual growth and a happier life. I would recommend this book to anyone, I think all of us have something to learn from it."
2,Ok this book is 2 of his earlier books in 1....,"I don't know exactly the titles, but one of the books is his most famous book. Anyway if you want to read something of Dyer, I suggest read the most famous and/ or first one of him, because others are just a rehash. But this one has another book combined in it, so 2 for the price of one. It has good way of explaining things and deviding it (sorry native language isn't English). Well that's all for me to say, it's up to you if you buy it or go to the library?!"
4,LOOKING INWARD,"I am going through major life changes...divorce, left my job, changing my behaviors...this book helped me to look inward at my self and the potentially hazardous ways I live (emotionally, physically, spiritually). This books helps to identify personality traits that you may be using that is keeping you from being your higher self..the book doesn't force or expect you to believe in God (if you don't believe) but it does make you look for a deeper connection with you and ""your higher power"". If you need direction, want change, want answers to why we do what we do, want to be joyful, content, and happy--GET THIS BOOK and follow its direction!! I thank my friend for lending it to me!"
5,A book about love,"This is the best book I have ever read on love. It is divine, uplifting and it helps you tune with God in the easiest, most compassionate and loving way. I highly recommend it."
2,Your Sacred Self,"I received this book thinking that I had ordered an audiobook. Istarted to read it and felt that I had read and seen this materialin Dyer's other self help books. I recognized some material from the101 ways to transform your life. I put the book down and could notfinish it. It seemed repetitous because I have read a lot of Dyer'smaterial. I love Wayne Dyer but this book just did not seem fresh. Again,it always depend on the person. Someone else may pick it up and love it.If you have read Dyer's other material then I think you will agreed itjust is not fresh or a fresh approach to the same material. F.J."
5,Restore Educational Liberty,"Food, clothing and shelter--we easily shop around for these things. Why not schooling services too? Unfortunately, most young people are sentenced to 12 years of forced mass schooling in minimum security prisons run by government bureaucrats. I should know, I am one of them.John Taylor Gatto, former New York City and State Teacher of the Year wrote this wonderful book and others where he explains how we got this awful institution, how bad it really is and how we can escape. His books are a must-read for all young parents and for anyone thinking about doing business with the educational establishment."
4,"Alarming, straight forward, eye opening!","I am the father on an ten year old daughter. She is now in 5th grade and I find myself supporting the broken education system by encouraging my child to conform. Conform to the system that is place now, so that she may be successful in the future. After reading this book, it made me think about the struggles I had with school and the unrealistic expectations I put on my child to succeed in such an oppressive system. Home schooling is the best alternative for now, because the reform needed in our public schools may never happen and if it does it will not happen for quite a while. If you are considering home schooling your child, you should buy this book."
2,Great Premise: No answers,"I purchased this book; because I liked the concept it taught. Sadly though, there is no answer in the book. Yes schools teach less than mediocrity; but where do we go from here.I began my teaching career under the direction of a brilliant educator. He looked beyond the ""box"" and considered education, not curriculum. Sure, a curriculum was taught; but he wanted children to learn. He cut out all the nonessential things like a whole series of bells. Children only needed 3 reminders each day. When to come into the school in the morning. When to return from lunch and when to be off school premises.While children are badly dumbed down, teachers are often dumbed down and worse is their principals and directors who are so rutted in their thinking.A good read if you need to think about the direction of education; but no answer, sadly. The author is very much a product of the system he condemns."
4,Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb,I actually had to read this book several times to get the point. It was well written and told the truth through the eyes of an experienced teacher. Reading this book helped me come to the decision to homeschool my kids
5,Understanding the Schooling System,"Dumbing Us Down has really helped me understand why I hated school so much. Gatto makes clear that the process of ""schooling"" doesn't teach us to follow our hearts but to lead us away from them. And schooling doesn't teach us to become better human beings but that we be good little workers in our industrial civilization. No wonder the rate of depression among children has increased a %100 and the suicide rate 500% in the last fifty years.I think if we're ever going to create a culture that values our well-being over the manufacturing of products Jonathan Taylor Gatto's insight on what it means to become educated will help us better understand how to do this. For it is the state sponsored school systems that inculcate so many of us with worthless knowledge so early in life."
5,A Must Read for ANY parent!!,"This is an eye opening book, well worth the small amount of money. It shows the faults of contemporary schooling, whether it is a public or even private school with or without religious teaching.I agree with the autor that going to school (any school) is a waste of childhood.This is definitely a ""thumbs up"" book.Read it and share it with your friends."
5,Every person who wonders why our shcools are failing should read this book,"This book offered a wonderful insight into the political influences on education. Neither a left leaning or a right- leaning work, this book digs through the stuff that pundits dwell and exposes the rusted out cogs of the educational machine. A strong recommendation as both a teacher and as a parent."
5,Amazing,I have been looking for a book that helps define why we homeschool...this is it!What I liked best is he was a teacher for thirty years and most of the book is from speeches for awards he got from the system he is fighting against.
4,every parent should read this,"Agree or disagree, this thought provoking book deserves a good look. I give it four stars, only because the new intro in this new edition is a little redundant."
3,Dumbing us Down,"This book is very interesting and covers many new reasons why I homeschool. It's begun to make me realize that I appreciate the independent thinking my child has developed.The text is a little difficult to read at times. There were times I nearly got out my dictionary as I was reading. I'm on the last chapter and it's been a little confusing; I'm waiting to see what his final point is going to be. Sometimes I'm not sure whether he's being sarcastic or not about a topic. It's been fun to read though, using my critical thinking skills."
1,Arrogance is Bliss,"John Taylor Gatto's book is not at all on the mark. He trashes the public school system, however fails to give clear, consise evidence and examples. He does nothing to offer solutions to this ""horrible"" system and even goes so far as to say that school is a jail for children. He may bring up important issues, however his arguments for them do not follow soundly. This was a horrible read and I hope that you do not waste your time reading this author's ill educated and thought out work. If you are concerned about your children's education this book will indeed scare you, however you should be aware that various other agendas may be at work here and they may not have your children's best interests in mind."
1,Someone please write about Jews and education...,"I haven't read Gatto's book; judging by the reviews it's not worth reading.It's well established that Jews in the USA have been in the forefront of promoting immigration, concealing the truth about Jews in the USSR, concealing the fact that Jews have huge influence because of the paper money fraud, and that this money filters down, so Jews own all the media, and control most assets.Therefore it makes sense to assume Jews have had a huge impact on education, since naturally they want their rivals to be as dim as possible. Mixing in blacks, promoting useless schemes like 'look say', all forms of dumbing-down, writing junk textbooks, starving serious universities and colleges of funds, discouraging languages, encouraging truancy etc etc are the sorts of things to be expected from Jews.Someone (or some group) ought to write a well-researched book on this topic."
4,Excellent commentary.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this brutally honest commentary on the modern school system. It resonated with my soul, validating many years of experience and observation. (Good on you, mate!) I love it when a courageous individual takes a small stone, puts it in a sling shot and then single handedly slays such an imposing Goliath with it. To my way of thinking, such a feat would classify the author of ""Dumbing Us Down"" as a hero."
3,not much I haven't heard before,"Gatto's short book is a good overview of the dangers of compulsory public education. However, it tends to be very repetitive, as it is simply a compilation of speeches and essays given by Gatto over the years. A lot of what he writes, I have read before, but that is perhaps more my fault than the author's. Also, most of the speeches are from the 1990s, and a lot has happened with the public education system since then. All in all, I'd recommend borrowing this book from the library instead of purchasing it. It is still worth reading, just not paying for. :-)"
5,Great book!,"I have always been an avid learner about the holocaust, and this book helped to know more about the man that started it all: Adolf Hitler. This really gave me insight into his ideas and philosophy, a definite must buy for all World War II buffs."
2,Good enough,"This is a good CD for people with no dance experience. You learn very basic moves. If you have some ballroom dancing, this cd is not for you. It does offer step by step instructions that are easy to follow."
3,Video Quality,"Since I am a beginner, the instruction fit my needs, however this is the first time I have rated video quality as average."
4,to laugh or not to laugh!,"When your meetings have become grey with dullness, consider a little humor.When the seriousness of business seems to have sunk everyone into boredom, try a little comedy.When your co-workers are sitting like bumps on a log, get the energy going again with a morsel of mania.Sheila Feigelson comes from a long line of appreciators of humor, & her book offers you ways in which to liven up those dreaded hours of dry statistics & logistics.She also lets you know when NOT to crack a joke!Well written, lightly treating a serious subject. Try ENERGIZE YOUR MEETINGS WITH LAUGHTER, you will like it!"
5,Great Learning Tool and a Timeless Reference,"This books starts with a simple explanation of the basics in the first chapter and builds from there. The thorough index allows you to quickly find the topic your looking for and the exhaustive examples allow you to quickly review the pertinent material. A thorough treatment of active filter design is covered by the time the reader finishes the last chapter. This book not only serves as an excellent introduction to the material for the novice/beginner, but also serves as an invaluable reference to the seasoned engineer."
5,An Excellent Book!,A practical book describing a step by step procedure in designing active filtering. The book is great for beginner and graduate level courses. It is also an excellent one as a reference in industry in filtering and signal processing. I read and learned the entire book in my master program 9 years ago and I still go back and use it.
4,Half a lifetime of learning pleasure,"I first bought this at a school book fair while still in junior high. Half a lifetime later it is still a treasure to me, albeit a well-worn treasure. Time for a new copy. I only wish for Donne's Holy Sonnet XIV: Batter My Heart, Three-Personed God, and Hopkins' Hurrahing in Harvest ... ""Up above, what wind-walks! what lovely behaviour/Of silk-sack clouds! has wilder, wilful-wavier/Meal-drift moulded ever and melted across skies? ..."" This is missing, but there is still enough (and but the beholder wanting). I wish, also, there were more high school English teachers who are excited, passionate about the great poets, but they've become mired in the cult of relevancy. Such a loss. Such a loss."
4,An excellent anthology,"If you want a good collection of ""famous"" English poetry, but don't want to spring for the pricey ""New Oxford Book of English Verse,"" this is a very good choice. It's acceptably thick (589 pages), and covers over 120 poets. The editors allot 10-30 pages each to the big names, so you get a good overview of their work. The book has a good-sized, attractive typeface, and is well-indexed.Drawbacks are minor, but include its age. It was published in 1955, and includes almost no 20th century poets, women, or minorities. There's no biographical or critical data, just the poems themselves. But as a resource for classics, this is a great collection, and a real bargain."
5,Great Short Stories,"Space Gladiators is full of great short stories by Brain W. Aldiss, Ben Bova, David Drake, Keith Laumer and more. Edited by David Drake, this is one in a series. There is also SPACE DREADNOUGHTS and SPACE INFANTRY (also edited by David Drake)."
4,Hitachi DE14DMR cordless drill kit,"Like all Hitachi power tools I own, this was an excellent value and performs far better than the comparable Ryobi's I have owned in the past. Battery life in particular is spectacular and recharging is quick and easy. Powerful and versatile, it is the first power tool I reach for on jobs."
4,This will work,"Let me first say, I was using the Transcender tests to help prepare for this exam and they where totally irrelevant. So be careful. The tests have always been useful in the past, but NOT for this exam. I failed my first attempt.I liked this book a lot from the moment I started it. Lots of hands-on examples. In fact, most of the book is example based. I went through and duplicated each one on my own PC, which I think is the way to go, rather than just reading it.I didn't see anything out there that resembles the actual exam questions, but this book gave me the necessary foundation of knowledge to work through the questions. I passed the exam on my second attempt."
4,tons of exercises,"This book provides tons of ""StepByStep"" exercises to learn all about remoting,web services, etc. It's a great book for those that do not hae tons of experience in these areas. In the same token, it maybe too much coding for the experience developer who is looking to gain just the facts to pass the test. If someone is looking for that, then look at the MS Press book.The one real complaint that I have is with the layout of the book. There is a lot of line wrapping which isn't really necessary, they could use the width of the page. But, this is the fault of the publisher, not the author.Overall, another great book by Mike!"
1,Horrible explanations,"Hi,I have passed the first two exams of the MCAD using microsoft training materail... I agree its not comprehensive, but at least it is short and to the point and most important is you understand what you are reading.This book is full of examples without any explanation. For eg: 3 pages of code has only 4 lines of explantion.... I am trying to force myself to read this book, but by the end of 2nd chapter (around 150 pages) i am forced to shut it and write this review.I think I am good at grasping things, I gave my first two exams in 2 weeks and scored around 930 on both of them ( 229 and 305 ).This book just focuses on step by step and fails to explain what each step means. I have worked with xPath and xml nodes at work, and I think the examples in the book about XML is unnecessarily confusing.I bought this book looking at the 4 stars, and can just hope that this book gets better in the comming chapters, cause I have my exam in a couple of weeks.Regards,Pranav"
2,Badly formated,The book is badly formated. It is only half full in most of the pages. The source code come with the book is very hard to read due to its poor format. Here is one example from the bookDim cmd as SQLCommand = _SQLConeection1.CreateCommand()The above statement should be able to fill in one line if the book does not use a stupid format.
5,Great Adult Contemporary/Smooth Jazz,"Just The Facts release entitled ""Only You"" is an exceptal CD! It blends Smooth Jazz, Adult Contemporary, Gospel and Fusion into a nice blend. This stuff should get some air-play!"
4,Unconvential contemporary jazz,"This is an contemporary jazz album that hasn't read the ""guidebook on being a conventional contemporary jazz album"". Thank goodness! It's a pleasant and energetic mix of light jazz sounds with fusion and rock influences peeking around the corners. Soulful and reflective on one hand and agressive and slightly edgy on the other. One of my favorite song starts by reminding me of Miles Davis and then morphes into something I might have heard Charlie Parker belt out before."
2,"Meticulously researched, but horribly written","A friend suggested I read this because I'm interested in historical fiction. And this guy is published? Amazing.Too many characters, each one ""Forrest Gump""-ized into managing to meet or be involved with some Major Cultural Event of the great age of immigration. Shallow characterization, aggressively bad dialogue, this book reads as if it were written for one of those bad TV movies starring Meredith Baxter Birney and Perry King."
3,"Ellis Island, historical fiction","My husband borrowed this book but returned it before I had a chance to read it. ""Ellis Island"" was of interest to me also, so I purchased a used book."
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this calendar last December, and we hate it! The spaces are too small to write on, and the format is too confusing. My husband hated it before we even started using it, and it didn't take me long (a few days) to agree. We stopped using it the first week in January. We will not purchase a calendar in this format again."
5,Can't live without it!,I have been using these calendars for the past 4 years and absolutely love them. I have a husband who works shift work (variety of day shifts and night shifts) and 4 children aged from teen to toddler. Before I started using this calendar I was always missing appointments and forgetting stuff. I hang this right by my back door so that everyone can see it and contribute to it and I can check it easily whenever I leave the house to be sure that I am going to the right place at the right time!
4,good,I used these numbers for try-outs. They seemed to hold up well over a couple of days. Shipped on time. Good stuff.
2,Very small but good quality,"Size is a big disappointment. They measure 3""x 6"", not much bigger than an index card. The quality is fine and holes are pre-punched but if you are expecting these to be the size of a small race bib, order something else."
2,Do in a pinch.,Tear resistant race numbers are fine for an informal race or event. Check some shoe company resources or other sponsors.
5,"This book is helpful to find ""le mot juste"".","Many times I know what I want to express, except I don't know how to exactly articulate my meaning.. This book gives me the resources to fully verbalize my ideas, using the approprate vocabulary and word nuances."
4,The Soup Bible,"I have been wanting the soup bible for quite some time. I am happy with this product, though it arrived a bit dirty. It's in good shape and arrived quickly. Thank you."
5,Great Book about the Back-to-the-land movement,This is one of the best books I've read about the back to the land movement of the late 60's and early 70's. It is both insightful and enjoyable. Well worth reading. Her experiences and writing style really bring the period to life.
5,Rare Gem,"This book is a rare gem. For those of us who experienced the hippie generation firsthand it is both nostalgic and cathartic. For younger folks who wonder what the heck we were thinking back then, the answer is in this book. One of the things I loved most is that it has no particular agenda; it is simply an honest and objective chronicle of what life was like for the author in an early seventies commune. The writing is captivating; it reads like a novel."
2,Misleading cover...,The cover is cool with the nude author and a bundle of ganja but misleading as Pot growing is not discussed really at any point in the book.I will say it was disappointing also in that It isn't very fun or nostalgic.Basically it is about well off Ivy league types moving to drop city in the southwest avoiding things and slumming with toothless dropouts and whacky locals.They raise goats and drive up and down dirt roads and live in domes but that's about it[other than a few affairs - wife/husband swapping]. I got the feeling the writer has ADD as she does not seem to cover anything in depth even though the book is way long.I can see why the Manson family didn't consider themselves Hippies and avoided these types .A much better read is LOST AND FOUNDLost and Found: My Life in a Group Marriage Commune (CounterCulture series)
2,"FORGET THIS BOOK, It's not worth it.","If you like dumb books than this is for you. I have collected comic books and I am an expert in discussing the marvel characters, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to say this book is bad. Sure, this book has an okay plot and the graphics are spectacular, but they cannot make up for the lack of characterization and sub-plots in this book. I give this book two stars out of five. It has an okay plot but is sorely lacking in areas that are vital to a good book."
1,no depth at all,"After waiting months for this book to come out I was extremely disappointed. It is totally superficial with no depth and detail at all. This is not a power user guide, this is a very shallow quickstart guide. The insight is limited to ""to use X, select X in the pulldown menu and click return"". It's that bad.I suppose that if you have never used a computer program before, this book might be helpful."
1,poor,Nothing more than a five page 'quick start' guide that has been shamelessly padded out with gallons of white space and extra large screen shots so as to turn it from a pamphlet into a book. Useless.
1,Total Ripoff: The only thing this ignited is the money in my wallet.,"...I will never buy another book through Amazon without reading customer reviews first. This book is complete GARBAGE and the author MUST know it. This books smacks of someone taking advantage of those who bought Digital Performer and were looking for a guide to help break down the learning curve. This books spends time figuring out cheap ways to waste your time and money by walking you through the MOST MUNDANE TASKS possible on a computer. Please, I need you to help me resize windows?? RESIZE WINDOWS?? OR QUIT THE PROGRAM!?! Please, this book should be listed as children's literature and that should be the end of it. My only consolation is that I bought it USED for $3..."
2,SO SO - not very many tips or tricks,I was really looking forward to this book. I was very dispointed that the book did not EVEN Mention the Drum Editor or Polar! The book did have some other useful lessons. I would have like to have seen more learning/instruction on creating loops and editing drums..
1,"If you bought the program, you won't need this book!","This has to be one of the worst book purchases I have ever made, and I paid the full retail 19.95 for it. I am the first to admit that DP4 is a very complex program, and I was looking for a book that would help me discover some of the more advanced features, but this book never gets past explaining the most basic of basic features. The graphics are page-filling, the type is large and, most annoying of all, the text does not explain anything you can't get from reading the ""Getting Started"" book which comes with DP4. I admit, I'd like to see a good after-market guide to Digital Performer, but this book is NOT IT! Pass it by if you value your money..."
3,To buy or not to buy....,"When I first came across this book I was actually going through an Amazon.com search covering most of the topics in McColman's book. So then I thought: ""Great, I'll just buy this book and it'll save me all the work!"" Or so I thought...While the author does do a great job in creating a general outline of books on several topics worth reading, I also thought that there were a few books worth mentioning that he missed, and was surprised that he had missed.Yes, everyone is entitled to their own opinions on what books are ""essential"" for the craft, but after buying this book, I think I have more luck just looking through search engines or browsing the New Age/Witchcraft section of the bookstore.Save the money, or don't, it's really up to you. Sometimes I'm glad to have the intial reference of books to look out for, but most of the time I wish I would've saved the money to buy another book; usually one not included in this one."
2,awful,I can't believe nike would slap their name on such an unreliable piece of crap. The watch worked great until about 4 months of ownership. The crappy rubber straps broke off from the display then the display became all distorted after one use in the rain on a run. It then proceeded to stop working completely. I'll buy a different brand of watches as this is the third nike watch that this has happened to me with.
3,An O.K album,"When I heard dysfunction I thought that staind was going to be heavy for all albums to come. Then break the cycle came out and man is this soft. It seems that they care about getting played more on MTV and singing nothing but ballads. This isn't what I expected from this band. However the album does have some good songs like outside, for you, and suffer, but songs like it's been a while and epiphany they could do without. Now all their albums sound exactly like this. They use to tour with heavy bands to now touring with 3 doors down. Whats next creed will have a reunion tour and staind coheadlines the tour. Any way this isn't stainds best album. If you want to hear a good staind album than hear dysfunction."
3,Two great songs and a whole lotta filler.,"This CD has two really good tunes in ""Outside"" and ""It's Been Awhile"". After that there is nothing that spectacular. Nothing really bad but nothing really good either. Aaron Lewis's voice begins to really annoy me after awhile. My God!! there is only so much whining I can take. Kurt Cobain was depressed but he didn't resort to this ""poor pitiful me"" whining. I give this three stars purely for the two great songs I mentioned earlier, if not for them this would be a one star CD."
2,Not At all a special album,"Staind really isnt that good to begin with, tho i amtold that they are pretty good live, but this albumBreak The Cycle by no means even influences me to gosee them live.As for this record Break The Cycle, all it hasare the hits, as well as the songs that werepromoted. Like Its been a while, epiphany,Take it,For You, Outside and Fade. The songs mentioned arereally the only reason to get this album, whichmeaning if you buy this record your gonna have toskip through it, cause this album is by no meanslistenable at all. I still dont understand howthis album even got as big as it did, but none the lesstruly a Bad Hard Rock/Metal record... If you want goodmetal get albums by Tool,Alice and Chains,A PerfectCircle.... Also the only reason why i give this record2 stars is cause it has the hits that we're actuallygood/decent, tho they did milked the living daylights outof this record so thats probably why."
1,"wow, this is terrible",i have five words for aaron lewis: marlon brando in apocalypse now. i keep waiting to hear a song from staind that ends...the horror....the horror. well it is horrible
4,An essential addition to your metal collection.,"BREAK THE CYCLE by STAIND is without a doubt a worthy addition to you cd collection. STAIND's sound is dark, hard and rocking and this blends into quite a good product. The lyrics on the album are filled with singer's AARON LEWIS dark lyrics detailing the pain and angst he has dealt with through his life. Some reveiwers have called him whiny, but his lyrics and the melodies the band puts out on this album is what sets them apart from all the nu-metal bands out there. You want some killer tracks to listen to, then check out these songs: PRESSURE, FADE, IT'S BEEN AWHILE, FOR YOU, WASTE,EPIPHANY. We also have a studio version of OUTSIDE, which I think is better than the live duet version Aaron did with Fred Durst. STAIND is a band to watch. They are a band that seems not to care about trends going on right now, they just want to make great music and on this album the do just that."
2,Staind is NOT metal,"I was reading an issue of Revolver magazine recently and saw that the winner for best ""Nu Metal"" band was Staind. Calling Staind metal makes no sense to me. Their guitars are somewhat heavy in small places, but that is the only hint of metal I see in their music. I hate Staind's music. I hate every song they released off Break the Cycle. This is simply because I really dislike their kind of music. Im into bands like Megadeth, Fear Factory, Pantera, and Static-X, to name a few. Static-X is a 'nu metal' band. Now honestly tell me, what in the world does Staind have to do with those bands I listed above?NOTHING. So my anger is not at Staind, I respect them and just dont enjoy their kind of music, my anger is towards people who associate them as a nu metal band. It just makes no sense to me. If I had to choose a name, I would choose melodic alternative rock. Thats not great, but more fitting than ""HEAVY METAL""."
3,depressing,"never heard a more depressing album than this.whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, i'm not really sure. sure, people may relate a lot to the whole album being that it speaks what they go through and feel. but one wonders if that doesn't actually fuel the depression and magnify it. and aaron sounds on the verge of crying... almost whining at some parts, but i guess that's the whole point. personal favourite track is 'fade'."
5,"Break the Cycle, how about break the record books",I'll keep it short and simple Staind delivers on this CD. If you like Staind or just getting in to them then get your tail off that computer chair and buy that CD.
3,Allright,"This album is the title of this review. The CD is a good effort, but it seems like some of the songs were a little rushed. I like most of the songs, but they all have a similarity to them. Well, I can't really write anything harsh. This is the 3rd album ( one was non-major release ) and you know how bands usually have one "" experimental "" record. Example: Deftones 'white pony' or 311 'transistor'. These were both good albums and Staind's is among them. For people who want a little sharper edge check out Dysfunction."
3,Slightly better than decent,"It got a 3, because there are just too many songs I always skip over to warrant being more than that. If they had simply chosen to cut these b-sides altogether and release a shorter album I'd be inclined to give it a 4. Because what's good here is really good. This album is likely as popular as it is for the way that it brings together both of the reasons why different people love Staind; rock anthems and ballads. You get them in equal shares here. And it works in a way that few other artists would be able to manage. Definitely worth your money. I'd pay the full price of the album for Epiphany alone."
4,good CD,"if you're looking for hard rock blending with metal and depressing introspective lyrics, look no further. This album of Staind fits the bill in these respects and has the hit ""it's been awhile"" and a few others. This is a must-have for anyone looking for a sad yet angry rock/pop song, while the earlier album ""dysfunction"" would be the better CD if you want to hear Aaron Lewis' screaming, with the instrumentals ringing true to a metal head-banger's ball."
2,What happened?,"The first StainD song i heard was ""Mud Shovel"" and was blown away by that. On the local college radio station, I heard a track from their earlier release ""Tormented"" and instantly fell in love w/ it. ""Break The Cycle"" seems so mellow. I am a hardcore rock fan. If you are a fan of mellow rock and enjoy songs like ""It's Been A While"" and ""Out Side"", you'll love this album. If you are a heavy rock fan like me, you will probably not like this. PS- The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because it's StainD!"
5,It's always raining in my head!,"Is it just me, or does Staind keep getting better and better? I liked the first album, but there wasn't anything about rain in it, so it couldn't really hold my attention. This is much better. The best song is ""Epiphany"". I love the line ""it's always raining in my head"". It rains in my head too. I thought I was the only one. The thing about ""acid rain"" in ""Open Your Eyes"" is cool too. Yeah, Staind is great, a great band for a rainy day. I want to find the song ""Black Rain"" somewhere. I'll bet it's good. BLACK rain?"
5,Good Stuff,"I went out and picked this up as soon as it came out and I wasn't disappointed. They've tweaked they're style a little bit to more accoustic numbers, but it suits them. As always with Staind you are going to have songs with a lot of emotion behind them. All the songs on here are pretty much derived of personal experiences that lead singer Aaron Lewis has had. The great thing about listening to this is that afterwards you almost feel like you know him on a personal level. All I can say is if you haven't picked this up give it a try for yourself. You just might dig what you hear and find you can relate to it."
4,Lyrically surpasses most newbies,"Staind has all the potential in the world to be one of the greats. Look at songs like Outside and For You. Catchy refrain, lyrics that actually mean something, and a good voice singing them. The album itself is definitely themed: My life sucks, because of Mom and Dad. My friend recently killed herself, and it was because of how her parents treated her, and I associate For You with her every time I hear it. Lyrically a fantastic record, in my opinion. It's nice when guys can write about more than getting some ass (DURST) or thinking about how they want to do little girls (KORN.) Staind is a great band in the making, and the last step will be to ditch Fred Durst and go solo. This album was bought by me out of curiosity, and I'm glad I got it. Kicks ass, and people who stomp on Staind because of one overplayed ballad should give this album a decent shot."
5,Break The Cycle,since the first time ive heard staind they gotten me through evey tough time and its as though aaron's going through the same things you are.im from saginaw texas and attend boswel high school
2,Enough already,"I was very exited about the release of this one, until the radio played ""It's Been Awhile"" 300 times a day. Thank God none of the radio managers found the other version of ""Outside"" (the good one without you-know-who doing ad-libs), which means there is at least one song that I'm not completely sick of. While I'm at it, cheer up guys, you're rock stars now."
1,Forget the cycle -- just break the CD,"Could someone please give Aaron Lewis a hug? This is one of the most unoriginal albums ever written because it's about the 2 millionth of its genre -- you know, the one where every song is about being a suicidal, rebelling teenager, or being ignored or hated, or being beaten by daddy, etc.? Why don't groups like this just shut up?I was given the displeasure of letting a friend of mine let me listen to this. I can't get a grip on why Lewis devotes the entire album to his supposed pain and suffering. Will there be another album just like, or maybe will he write about -- gasp -- reconciliation with his parents?I have a better idea: The next time they write an album, at the very least, Lewis should come up with 10 whiny, boring songs and have the other three be about little bunnies and flowers."
1,"Not Staind, but Pile of Fred Durst","This thing is terrible. How many times can you repeat the words Its Been Awhile? Someone's smoked one too many. Its Been Awhile bears an uncanny resemblance to Alice in Chain's Down in a Hole, a great song that Staind has obviously just mimicked, minus the Alice in Chains genious, but who will notice, right? The rest of this album really [bad] too. What happened man? Dysfunction was a killer record. The only explanation is that Fred Durst snuck in when they were finished and just trashed the sucker.I don't know who the people are rating this thing, but Im willing to bet [...]. Thats how he got popular, not by actually being a good musician."
2,Not as good as Puddle of Mudd,"Aaron Lewis is fighting a losing battle with Staind. He should just drop them off at the gas station he picked them up at, and start belting out some phenomenal material from his real band, Puddle Of Mudd. Why do artists collaborate so much. They should focus on one band!"
3,Whine whine whine,"Musically, this album is fine art. The instruments and feel is awesome. But it's also one of the whineyest albums of all time. Every song is about self-pity and being depressed. After about 5 songs you're either crying about how bad you imagine your life to be, or changing the disk for something that's a little more uptempo. It just makes you want to slap whoever wrote it and tell 'im to get a hold of himself, because life is beautiful and actually worth living.Take a lesson from Lemmy: Born to Lose, Live to Win."
2,I gave my copy to my mom.,"I was very disapointed when I got this album. The songs all have the same sound to them and are generally annoying. Plus, after you hear him on the radio so much, you never want to hear Staind again. I gave mine to my mom because I didn't want it anymore. Don't buy this album."
3,"Good, but not good enough","This cd is good, but nothing compared to Dysfunction. Let's relate it to the first cd - almost all of the songs are like ""Home"" and they lost their harder stuff on this cd. The first song, Open Your Eyes, should become a hit. But besides that and Can't Believe (which in my opinion stunk) there isn't much hardcore. So if you like songs like ""Home"" from their first album, go out and buy it because you are going to like it. If you like harder stuff like ""Raw"" then this cd will be a waste of your money. In my opinion, this cd is not as good as Dysfunction and I was a little dissapointed, but hey it couldn't get any better than Dysfunction. If you don't have that cd, save your money on this one and go out and buy Dysfunction."
3,Mixed thoughts...,"This is by no means a ""bad"" cd.. however I enjoyed this energy,anger, and intensity of dysfunction as opposed to the more softer conventional rock that is basically the whole CD with the exception of ""Can't Believe""... The Cold album is much better than this"
4,Nice,"This is obviously a huge step up from Dysfunction.It's more melodic, and seems a bit more (well, a lot more) emotional.Although it sounds like much of the Nu-Metal stuff, it can still hold it's own thanks to the vocal talents of Aaron Lewis.Unfortunatly, the studio version of ""Outside"" is horrible.It would have been smart to include the live version of it instead of the horrible live version of ""It's been Awhile"", which isn't all that great (On first listen, my friend did not even realize it was a live version, dont know what that means).Thankfully, the other tracks are for the most part very good.Good songwriting (I love the first song, the lyrics hit home big time and are some of the most true to life lyrics I've heard).At some points however, the songs seem a bit odd in the chorus', but nothing to major.Overall, it's a great album, despite a few glares that prevent it from getting a perfect score."
3,A great cd but not as good as dysfunction,"I couldn't wait to get this cd. Then when I listened to it i was a little dissapointed. This cd has many soft songs but still great lyrics. there are also some standout songs like ""Open Your Eyes"" and ""For you"". although on dysfunction the songs are much heavier which i like more such as ""Mudshovel"" and ""Raw"" and ""Spleen"". Their is no hidden song on BTC either. But no matter what Staind is still a great band."
3,Took a step back from their debut.,"Okay, I am a huge fan of Staind and I got Break the Cycle, oh..well, right when it was released at Midnight so needless to say, I was quite excited to put this in the CD player and see what would come out....and well, I was a little disappointed. Now, I loved their debut ""Dysfunction"", it was the perfect blend of thrash/melody, whatever you wanna name it. Not to say that this follow up is weak in any way...it's just different. Tracks like ""Can't Believe"" and ""Change"" really show the true side of Staind and how they did things previously but it seems that they chose to ""soften""(some of their songs really sound EMO) their sound and arrangements so basically what you get is more song structures similiar to ""It's Been Awhile"" and ""Outside"" which to me, I find very depressing. This is an okay CD, but not the one you should start out with when it comes to Staind. Aaron Lewis, you should have screamed a little more.......it brings a tear to my eye. =*("
1,Monotonous monotones,Aaron Neville or whatever this lead guy's name is is simply horrible. The 2 - 3 songs that get played 150 times a day on the radio sound exactly the same.Granted the acoustic guitar along with the rock music sounds intriguing but in reality. Doesn't really work too well. Especially when the lead singer whines throughout the songs and sounds like he's got a congested nasal cavity.
1,Awful followup,"I was looking forward to the new release by Staind. After the first listen all I can say is I am very disappointed with the album. Gone are the angry emotions and feelings that carried their first release and instead we end up with a second effort that is dull, dreary and down right boring. I gave my copy away after 2 listens. I would not recomend this to anyway unless you like your music slow and dead with no emotion."
4,Just Plain Great,This a fantastic CD. Two of the best songs on this have to be Outside and It's Been A While. The rest of the CD is great as well. It's just a great addition to any music collection.
2,"not for me, maybe for you if you're depressed","What a depressing recording.It takes you down into the dumps and leaves you there.If you can relate to misery passed on from generation to generation, you're all set.Angst and more angst, that's what you get.Not a very pleasent or uplifting experience."
5,Breaking The cycle of Poor CD's,"Stainds New Album Break The Cycle, is the hardest yet most melodic album to come out this year. From the eternally hard Fade to the amazing melodic lyrical style on epiphany, these guys get it right. Aaron's lyrics seem to connect with everyone young and old. Mike nmushok's guitar riffs are soothing yet hard at the same time. The whole album is like a therapy session to get out your anger. I have been following these guys since their independant release Tormented. I am very happy to finnally see Aaron Lewis, Mike Mushok, Johhny April and John Wysocki finally get the recognition they deserve. If you are contemplating buying this album, do it now you wont regret it. Also their first major release dysfunction is also as good though not as polished."
2,Aaron Lewis whines too much.,"Wow, this cd came out and the whole world (particularly the one dominated by mtv) raved about it. I sincerely hope this is not ""what rock has evolved into"". The entire cd is a pile of over-mainstreamized, whiney, mass-appeal crap.Whoever Staind hired for marketing sure did a good job though; I've heard people deem this as ""underground"" or ""metal"". No, folks, this is pure trl-trash. The entire cd sounds pretty much the same way, same themed songs, same feel throughout.I recommend this cd only to those following the mtv-created rock-trend. This is merely trend-rock that every teen and teeny-bopper can relate to,(""ooh poor me""). If you watch the ""It's Been Awhile"" video on trl every day, and like what you hear... go ahead and buy this. Otherwise invest in a REAL metal cd."
5,this is the best cd!,hey this is lisa's daughter i got this cd as soon as i heard about it i think its a great cd! its a limp bizkit and korn mixed together almost it seems like they tell really stories about what peeps go through and all and that y i think u should get this cd its a really good one and a keeper also if ur into this then u will def love THE FACULTY soundtrack its also reall good
2,Where's the Energy ???,"I've been a Staind fan for quite some time now, and when ""Dysfunction"" was released, I was like ""this CD kicks major you know what."" ""Spleen"" and ""Raw"" and ""Mudshovel"" were just excellent, well-made pieces of art, expressed in the anger and emotion of 4 dudes from Mass. But the new CD, ""break the Cycle"" is just lacking some obvious things...like catchy guitar riffs and some awesome screaming. That whole side of Staind went down the tubes, as far as I'm concerned. Also, at least 7 of the songs on the new CD are off of ""Dysfunction,"" just tinkered with, making them slightly different. I'm sorry, but this could be the beginning of the downfall for Staind, unfortunetely. Hopefully i'm wrong, cuz I love the band, but for a sophmore album, this one falls well short of my expectations. That's my 2 cents."
3,Generic dumb stuff,"Aaron's material never runs out, but original melodies for the songs do. On this cd, only fade, outside, epiphany and its been awhile are good. every other song is boring and forgettable."
4,very good cd,"I have downloaded the whole cd prior to the release so it has had a chance to grow on me before I went out and bought it today. It is even better than their 1st cd which is hard to do. I don't usually give out 5 stars so 4 stars from me is very good. Best songs, ""It's been a while"", ""Open your Eyes"", ""Fade"", ""Outside"", and ""For you"". They are all very good though and you won't be disappointed if you buy it."
3,3 1/2,"I must admit that previous to writing this review, i listened to ""Break The Cycle"" only once in its entirity, so my opinion may change some with repeated listens. This set of songs, is toned down and more melodic. Lyrically, there are some new themes, but for the most part it is Aaron Lewis trying to make sense of his life. I genuinely like all of the songs, but they seem to lack the melodic variation that i was hoping it would have. All in all though this album is alot better than most of the albums that are out today. Definitely pick it up, its worth the money. Dan."
2,wake up everyone!,"is it just me, or does ""It's been awhile"" sound waaaaaaaayyyyyy too much like ""Home"" from dysfuction? It seems like these guys had a big hit and decided to mimic that hit just to ensure commercial success. If you listen closely, the guitar riffs are almost identical in many songs."
1,Get a Clue,"Dude, you guys, I'm telling you. The music industry is completely ruining EVERYTHING, everything being creativity, difference, talent. This Staind album represents the absolute bottom of the barrel, the music industry just digging their claws into a band that I actually had hope for, instead, I am left hopeless."
1,Just plain boring,"Staind is nothing more than a self-involved bald fat guy with a pierced eyebrow. Is that signature ""eyebrow ring"" supposed to be cool or something?? I'll tell you what would be a lot cooler: good music.These guys crowd up the radio with their boring brand of bland corporate rock, no different from many metal bands in the 80's. There are TONS more bands out there who deserve radio airplay, rather than Staind.I can empathize with Staind fans who might get something out of Aaron Lewis' demoralizing lyrics - but that's all. Musically, I've heard better tunes done by the Brady Bunch.P.S.: These guys toured with Stone Temple Pilots on the latest Family Values tour, and were swiftly upstaged. Aaron Lewis does not have what you'd call an entertaining stage precense. Maybe he had too many hot dogs before going on!!..."
1,Overrated pile of (....)......,"There's not a single sign of talent in site here. Just because they are repeating the same grunge ... that was heard in the early 90's makes these guys great and full of talent? Oh, they write (boring) mellow music and that's suppose to make them great too right? Please, Staind is just a bland, boring and simple band with no creativity whatsoever. Why listen to this poor rip off early 90's Seatle grunge band when you can listen to the original? There's much better mellow music out there. Don't waste your time with these corporate, money stealing chumps here. One more thing Amazon.com, this is what you call alternative METAL? Staind doesn't come close to being metal in the first place! No heavy riffs, insane drumming, or original metal lyrics is not presented here at all."
1,Just depressing,"Not only are the lyrics depressing, it's also depressing that this band actually makes money. Every song is packed with complaints. It's really repetetive and annoying. Why this band is so popular is beyond me."
1,Will it ever stop?,"I cannot believe this current whiny trend in music. Of all of the current pop music, Staind seems to be the worst. All of this album is excruciatingly awful. I recommend that the members of this band find another line of work or quit whining."
4,Not Bad For A Second Album,"As in the case with most bands such as Rage Against the Machine, Tool, Limp Bizkit, most bands tend to experement with their sound on their follow up album. Dysfunction was a hard hitting album for Staind. Songs like ""Raw"" are just plain awesome. Break the Cycle offers a toned down version of Dysfunction. In this album, there are alot more acustic tracks such as ""Its Been Awhile"", ""Outside"" and ""Epiphany."" But the record still has the heavy songs that made Staind famous such as ""Open Your Eyes"", ""Pressure"" and ""Can't Believe."" If you liked Dysfunction, I think that you will also like Break the Cycle. But be prepared to open your mind to the acustic sound of Staind. I believe that we will be seeing several more great albums from these guys."
2,I should be paid $80/hr to listen to this angst!,"In my opinion, this album is dark, morbid and depressing. That, in itself, is not always a bad thing. The Cure is great at it. Tool has taken the somber mood (not to mention musical complexity) and elevated it to a higher level. But Staind's 'Break the Cycle' is not much more than some very mediocre music supported by a professional whiner. All this guy does is whine and complain about his problems without one ounce of any sort of redeeming value. It's like being a fly on the wall at one REALLY LONG AND BORING THERAPY SESSION! I say hold off on the next record until somebody gets this guy some serious Psycho-Therapy and excessive amounts of various medications. Maybe it's me, but I just can't relate to much of the lyrics. And it's not because they are brooding and dark that I can't get into them. It's more like just sitting and listening to someone complain about their problems for like an hour. And who needs that?"
2,Will good rock ever return?,"This is one of the worst hard rock/heavy metal albums I have ever heard. The pluses of it is that it does have 3 good singles - Its Been Awhile, Outside, and Fade, and thats about all the songs on here that are worth listening to, unless your depressed. There is no energy behind album, and by about the fifth track I am sick of hearing Aaron Lewis whining, not to diss Staind, but I thought there first album was 100 times better, and was expecting something more."
3,Good but not great,"Staind is quite a good band that was discovered by Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit. I haven't heard their debut, but I own the cd ""Dysfunction"". I also own this cd. ""Dysfunction"" is a hard rock cd with slow songs like ""Home"". There is no advisory sticker on the cd even though there is some profanity. ""Break The Cycle"" is a slower, softer Staind. The advisory sticker on this explains it all. If you've heard the song ""It's Been Awhile"" then you would know what I am talking about. There are some very good songs on the cd thought such as ""Open Your Eyes"", ""Suffer"", ""For You"", and ""Waste"". I haven't listened to the cd in quite awhile since I've gotten the KoRn cd, ""Untouchables"", and the Cold cd, ""13 Ways To Bleed Onstage""."
3,Eh...,"Not terribly good, not terribly bad. You kinda gotta be in the mood for these guys because pretty much every song is the same. This is not a bad thing but they don't switch it up often and when they do it's just screaming and hollaring so you can't tell anyway. It's not that bad but not that good. I'd be picky and just Dl or buy singles honestly."
4,Excellent buy,"More and more good songs are surfacing on this CD. I bought it for ""It's Been Awhile"" back when that song was the big hit. After I got a little tired of it (for shame, radio stations, for overplaying good songs!!), I set this CD back on the shelf.Until a new song is suddenly played by Staind, on the radio! And lo and behold, it's on this CD! Pretty much a lot of the recent songs that have been playing on the radio by Staind are on this CD, including ""Fade"", ""Outside"", ""It's Been Awhile"", and ""For You"". Especially ""For You,"" which I'd never listened to before I heard it on the radio and rushed home to find that it was on a CD I owned. Now it's my favorite Staind song.This CD is an excellent buy, to get all the good recent Staind songs."
3,Not Bad For Nu Metal,"Actually, thid CD is not so bad for nu metal. I myself despise nu metal, but after hearing It's Been Awhile on KNAC, I decided to get it. It's not too bad, once you get used to it. I can be kind of depressing sometimes, but that is expected for a nu metal CD. I got this clean version because I don't really go for a lot of swearing in the music. It kind of ruins the song. So I wouyld call this the only nu metal CD worth getting."
4,Troubled,Man Aaron Lewis hasn't had it easy but at least in one song state it's not his father's fault. I had been turned on to their music after hearing Outside (Fam Values) version on the radio. It just sounded so raw and different. It's heavy but this dude is strumming along the whole time. It's wild. On one hand you appreciate the music so much but you wonder what Aaron Lewis had been put through. You have a nice blend here of melancholy songs and a few that would take the paint off your walls depending on your mood.
4,Not as good as previous two,"This cd is not as good as dysfunction or even the indie record tormented but its still good. The problem i have with this cd is its kinda repetitive and the lyrics are to self loathing with the exception of some songs(open your eyes,waste,etc.)Best songs are open your eyes,pressure,its been awhile(although ridiculously overplayed),and epihany. These guys arent MTV sellouts. The cd is lighter and more melodic then the previous two, but a band has to change and i personally like the more melodic approach but the songs arent as exciting and dark as before. Better luck next time guys. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TOOLS NEW RECORD:LATERAULUS."
1,This CD disappointed me very much,"After becoming a huge Staind fan after their album, Dysfuction, I waited and immediately purchased this album. I listened to it... and it ...(stinks). This album is practically the same song performed over and again. The speed, anger, and emotion of dysfunction is all gone. The band seems to have taken the song outside and its popularity a little far and produced a cd of watered down rock song that really ....(stinks). This is more of a pop-rock album that a hard rock album like dysfunction. Overall, this album was a waste of my money and i'm trying to get rid of it."
1,Stop whining,"Aaron Lewis should seriously see a psychiatrist or something, due to all the whining about his life [being bad] on this album. Oh wait, then he wouldn't make millions off 12-year-old girls who think he's ""cute"" and can ""totally relate to his problems"" buying his album. I know you are all going to vote this review ""not helpful,"" and go on not paying attention to me, but if you're into angst rock, why not get into bands like Glassjaw and Jets to Brazil who can sing about their lives without sounding stupid? Or better yet, forget listening to some guy with an acoustic guitar crying, and actually FEEL the depression via Radiohead and Sigur Ros?"
3,Songs sound the same,"Break the Cycle is far different from the first, Dysfunctional. BtC lacks all the originality the tracks from the first had, and each track sounds pretty much the same, with the exception of a different guitar intro for each. Overall, I'm very disappointed, as Staind begins to sound more and more like everyone else out there."
5,It's Been Awile since I've heard a CD as good as this.,"BUY THIS! It is the best CD I have ever listened to since I got the Foo Fighters. Good Price, every song is great, personnaly, I think It's been Awile is going to get a grammy award. So BUY THIS CD"
1,What the hell Happened?,"When I first heard Staind, I was mesmorized. Dysfunction was an absolutely amazing album. Their first release, Tormented, was even more amazing. Then I listened to Break the Cycle. This album is nothing but a bunch of MTV crap. I don't know what the hell Fred Durst did to this band, but he should be punished. This album does not have an iota of the intensity that was shown on the previous two albums. Anyways, save your money. If you want to spend it on something worthwhile, go get Lateralus by TOOL, or Statement by Nonpoint. At least these band still have some intensity."
4,Excellent music and lyrics,Break the cycle was so amazing at first twenty listens; that I went out and bought an acoustic guitar. Staind has influenced me to explore my musical talents even further. I think this cd is one of the best of the nu-metal artists. Outside is my favorite song. The use of psychological lyrics makes this cd an orignal one of kind classic.DIO is my other favorite band. I can't wait to see DIO in concert; for his U.S. 2002 summer tour. His new cd is called Killing the Dragon. I think all the proceeds from the cd are being donated to the september 11 foundation. All you Staind fans will probably dig DIO.
3,They broke something....,"Staind's first cd was amazing, so when i picked up this cd i had high hopes of what i would hear. It was sorely disapointing. Staind definately changed with all their popularity from their first cd. Some of the lyrics to the songs are ok, but the music definately is lacking something from their original album. Aaron still does a good job releasing his anger/sorrow/pain whatever he has bottled up inside him, and his songs really reflect how he feels. But the music is sold-out, definately not up to the standard of Staind's original cd. If you want something good, but their first album ""dysfunction""."
4,break the cycle,this was a really good cd and anyone who likes staind should definitely buy it. it has some really good songs on it and it was really worth the money.
4,Great lyrics,Great CD. The lyrics are awesome. The lead singer sounds a lot like a lot of other guys out there right now but all in all he is great.
1,Pathetic,These guys are beyond weak. Poor excuse for a band. I can't believe these buttwipes take themselves seriously.
3,31/2 stars,"This album was a bit dissapointing to me, especially after hearing It's Been Awhile, Outside, Dysfunction, and Tormented. Break the Cycle isn't a bad album, it just could of been better. The best tracks are Fade, Open Your Eyes, Outside, and It's Been Awhile. Pressure and Change are also good but the rest of the album really dissapointed me. Staind looks like there on the verge of selling out. They didn't sell out completely with this album, hopefully there next is more like Dysfunction and Tormented./ Heres some really good CD's that just came out: TOOL- Lateralus/ Static-X-Machine/ Stabbing Westward/Get those instead of this."
5,"""Open Your Eyes,"" This Album Is ""For You""","Sorry, but I just couldn't resist the play on words in my review title. This is the third album released by the band, and it's definately their best effort to date.Aaron Lewis, and his throaty vocals, truly shine on this album. In ""Break the Cycle,"" Staind puts together a contemporary group of songs with true-to-heart, candid lyrics. Although some may view them as ""dark,"" it is hard to ignore to truth, albeit, the sometimes bitter truth of heartbreak and broken homes.""Outside"" is an excellent stand-out single that has a nice acoustic feel to it, and the version cut with Fred Durst is amazing. Other awesome tracks include ""It's Been Awhile, ""For You ,"" and ""Change.""Staind has put together a excellent album written with a lot of strong emotion, and is complete in almost every way imaginable. ""Break the Cycle"" is a pleasant surprise and it's an album worth purchasing."
3,Music for all kinds of moods,'Breaking the Cycle' is generally a good album. With monster hits as 'Outside' and 'It's Been A While' one will at least find two numbers that's worth the price of the album.I bought the record after having listened to 'It's Been A While' on the radio and seing a TV commercial for the album. On my weekly visit to the local record retailer I rather spontaniously decided to buy the album. And I was definately not disappointed.However I think 'Breaking the Cycle' is somewhat confusing. It has very hard tracks such as 'Open Your Eyes' and 'Pressure'. And then it has beautiful ballads such as 'Outside' and 'It's Been A While' that ironically enough have become the two major hits of the album. One could argue that it's strong of a band to be able to give an album a diversity. But in this case I find it very inconstant and fickle.A good album that will however gather some dust after a couple of months.
2,big letdown,"i really liked staind's first album. it was catchy, hard, and intimate. this one just .... maybe thier brush with radio-play popularity made them hungry for more, because the songs on this album sound like they were made specifically for the radio. they are uninspired, uninteresting, and don't make me want to jump around or freak out in any way (except maybe in disgust). however, i'm glad my 14 year old little brother is listening to this instead of christina aguliera."
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I had heard the song Its been a while on the radio and on tv I thought it was a good song and thought the rest of the cd would be better. I was wrong however I found that most of the songs are depressing and some of them sound like something my former best friends brother would listen to. He can be a real jerk. His music is all about screaming, anger and nothing more than that."
2,A flop,"Break The Cycle, Staind's third album, is a fair stab at attempting to express Aaron Lewis' anger, depression and regret and to give young, disaffected listeners a chance to relate to it. However, this task more often than not seems a chore, trying to listen to Lewis' groaning, drawn-out vocals and often boring musical accompliment. Singles It's Been A While and Outside display Staind's style in a newfound maturity, wrapped in almost pretty melodies, but unfortunately these songs struggle to stand the test of time, and are not very durable. Personally I can relate to the lyrics, but I think that doesn't make the listening to of this album any easier. Despite occasional moments of radiance on Break the Cycle, I regret to say that it is probably not a worthy buy."
4,Better than I thought,"This CD has very thought out lyrics. It has lyrics that make you feel. The only weak tracks on this cd are the ones where they try to be harder than they really are. Songs like ""Outside"" and ""For You"" are really songs that I believe everyone can relate to in at least one time in their life. It is music like this that will hopefully crush that pop that exists for the sake of 8 year old girls."
4,Staind Break the Cycle/ Issues,"Ok i'am a new Staind fan and i first heard of them when listening to the concert version of Outside with Fred Durst which was amazing...anyway!I think theres been bad reviews about this album, but i thought it was amazing! I can play it over and over without getting bored! My favorite song has to be Epiphany.Theres so many issues raised in the songs if you listen carefully enought. Its a very well written and produced album and Staind deserve a pat on the back!! BUY IT!I'am off to buy Dsyfunction now lol"
2,Poor,"This album is a bit boreing and really has no emotion. All the songs seemed contrived and seem to be pandering to the teen masses. Im sick of hearing how great this band is because they are boreing , listining to this album is like spending time in a coffin. I'm also sick of seeing this joke of a lead singer with his eyes three fourths shut moaning out his songs with total contrived emotion. This bands nothing overall and all in all there be gone soon enough."
1,Ick,"This album blows. I thought we had enough of this in the early nineties grunge phase. This band used to have a little energy, but this is dreary and boring."
4,This is more like 4 and a half stars,"This was the first album I got fom Staind, I first heard Outside on a mix, and then I heard It's Been Awhile and I decided I should buy it, I thought it was a bit heavy at first but now I like it even more. The singer's abilities are very high, and I think he is one of these day's top singers in rock bands. The drums have lots of weird tiime signatures like in Open Your Eyes, and these fit very well to this genre of music. I love the bass' sound, very deep and heavy. Overall, I think it is their top achievement, too bad that they are softening up... But I have to say thank you to you guys who led me the way to the wide world of metal and rock. If you want some real Staind, this is the Cd you should buy, if you think it's too heavy, buy 14 Shades Of Grey, if you still think it's too hard, then their new album Chapter V is their softest, but to me seems the most heartfelt yet"
5,Staind BREAKS THE CYCLE!!!!,"I have to say, at first i was a little disappointed because BTC doesnt have that raw power. I admit it is a little over produced. But if you are a true Staind fan you will love the album for what it is. Staind has grown very much in the last couple of years. From their Tormented days to Dysfunction and now Break the Cycle. Each time they improve their sound. I think this album is GREAT. It has everything! From It's Been Awhile to the hard hitting Cant Believe. I'm tired of hearing everyone say that Staind has sold out. They still have the same emotion as their past albums, this one is just softer and more melodic. By no means has Staind sold out. If you are indeed a TRUE Staind fan you will enjoy this album and every other release they come out with!!!!!"
3,Not as good as the first album,"Staind's first album was amazing, with clever songwriting, good lyrics, and excellent production. Staind's latest release ""Break the Cycle"" seems like it should have come first. The songs aren't as developed and are generaly lacking in quality. The production quality is noticably not as good as it was on the previous album. A lot of the lyrics and riffs sound suspiciously familiar. It sounds like they just rewrote their first album, and did poor job of it. I think fans of Staind will still like this album, but if you were expecting Staind to step it up to a whole new level like I was, I think you will be disappointed."
3,Underwhelming,"I just can't shake the feeling that this album lacks the inspiration of their debut CD, dysfunction. It's obvious that they have changed -- slower songs, less screaming, less profanity, but does that mean they've matured as musicians? I don't necessarily think so. While some of the album's songs are quite enjoyable, others are bland and unoriginal almost to the point of being filler.Overall, it's a decent album, but not great by any means."
1,another prosaic piece of noise,"I'm 16, but I have the common sense not to waste my time or money getting depressed and pissed off over this bull. When other kids my age watch MTV or VH1 and see people like Lewis, Durst, or the guys from Linkin' Park and countless other rap/ rock bands, is that really what they want to be? Do they really look up to those guys? Depressed, ignorant, boring, and foul mouthed slacks.This is a terrible album, not worth anyones attention. It's the same insipid junk all the way through the album. I don't know why people would invest 17 bucks on something so montotonous, something so musically vapid. Think twice before you get this, and then do some searching in the record stores or on amazon. There are quite a few albums that sound alive, and burning. Yeah I feel teenage angst but I'm not gonna sit around pissed off about it, I'm gonna make something with it.Give it up all you ""Nu-metal"" bands and all you disciples of ""Nu-metal. Don't get this. Lighten up."
3,More like 3 1/2 stars,"This album has really good lyrics. That's about it though. I think the hard rock thing gets kind of old after a while, but I'm more of a rap/r&b fan anyways, so I guess that's my fault. ""It's Been Awhile"" is definitely the best song on here by far in my opinion. The rest of it I think just kind of blends together. If you're not a real big rock fan, but you like the song ""It's Been Awhile"", I would just by the single. If you're a rock fan and you want a really good rock album, this is for you."
5,Amazing comeback,"Break the Cycle is a wondeful effort by the boys in Staind. Aaron returns with the same angus ad rage in his lyrics, and proves he can be a even better lyric writer. He also has possibly the best voice I have ever heard. I like 7 songs, which are as followed:1.Open You Eyes-5/5-Hard guitar & bass intro with touching lyrics and a haunting sound.2.Pressure-3/5-Also has a hard intro and fairly good lyrics, but it is kind of boring. The only very good part is the B-section (My head hurts, this $h!t isn't geting me h!gh,etc.).3.Fade-4/5-Another song with great lyrics. I gave it 4 because the verses get too silent.4.It's Been Awhile-5/5-You know...8.Suffer-5/5-My favorite,and by far it's the most angry an the hardest song.10.FoYou-5/5-Their latest single, and my 2nd favorite. This is also very hard.11.Outside-5/5-Outstanding job on a acoustic song! This has a good chrous and good lyrics.If you like bands like Cold, Godsmack, or KoRn, you will love Staind.<BR..."
3,About what I expected.,"I've had this CD for maybe a year, and I absolutely loved it for awhile. However, eventually I found that the songs had become a bit -too- loud. They're by no means fast and furious, but they're a bit repetitive. The lyrics are often quite beautiful and truthful... but sometimes I feel like it's all for the sound, and no meaning. I would have to say that the best song on this CD is Safe Place. It's extremely original, and it keeps this CD above two stars. Don't buy this CD if you're expecting something groundbreaking. It's not. It's just another addition to the world of okay music. Hey, at least it's better than Korn. The songs are catchy, but get tired, and I actually went into a stage of depression for a few weeks because I listened to it too much. It's a very angry and sad CD. Not suitable for all the time, if you're the type who listens to the lyrics carefully, and doesn't want to turn into a depressed mutant. Nice CD. Not incredible. Just nice."
3,"Heartfelt, but too damn depressing","Each and every song one this CD is crafted very well, with beautiful lyrics and either soft, soothing acoutsic guitar or hard, driving rock and roll. The one reason I don't give this CD even four stars is it's so damn depressing. I don't mind depressing music, but a whole CD is really more than I can handle. Although every song has a unique quality to it, and the lyrics are amazing on each one, the depressing message in EVERY song is too much to handle sometimes. I'm a guy who likes up-beat and happy stuff as opposed to this, but all-in-all not a very good CD, at least musically. The lyrics are very poetic as well, and it's actually about 3 1/2 stars."
1,I can't give it ZERO stars??,"This my friends has to be one of the most dissapointing albums I have ever experienced. Other than ""Outside"" and ""It's Been Awhile"" this is an album full of songs that somehow seem familiar to the ears. Probably because groups like, Creed, Godsmack, Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Deftones have been playing these songs for years. If you are into those bands and love to hear Aaron Lewis scream for a whole song and call it quality music, then this cd is for you. I honestly feel cheated. What upsets me most is that ""Outside"" and ""It's Been Awhile"" were a hoax to get all the millions to buy a copy, and it worked. But there is only one or two songs other than those that is even decent. I'm sure if you're a diehard then buy it, but if you are looking for music with lyrics that really have meaning go somewhere else. This album is definitely my choice as worst album of the year."
1,Too much hype!,"This band has to be one of the most overrated bands out there today. I've read all the reviews and can't believe people actually like this crap. The vocals sound like every other band of this genre out there(creed,godsmack,3days grace, and the list goes on).The lyrics are pathetic as all the singer does is whine about such a hard life he's had. Dude,get over it!The vocals are annoying.And the just to clarify this band is alternative, not metal. I suggest skip this band for those who have taste.If you want to hear some real metal check out bands like Annihilator, Overkill,Cradle of Filth, Exodus, Arch Enemy, just to name a few. If you have respect for true musicians, you'll avoid this band at all costs."
2,Trys too hard,"(...) I only give it 2 stars because ""its been awhile"" is at least a descent song that deserves recognition. (...)"
2,WOW! This sucks...,"...and always will. Staind had a great song, ""Its Been Awhile"", so I bought the cd in hopes that all the songs were like that. Ha! That's a good one. The lead singer belts out one tune after another, sounding so much alike- I'm surprised that there are more than three tracks on the album. Some tunes are catchy. Other words are written beautifully with no beat or tune to back them up. And somewhere, in this icky mess of sameness is mixed up this awesome alternative rock song, ""It's Been Awhile."" Where'd it come from? What was Fred Durst thinking when he took on this group of stoners."
1,Skid Marks,"Well we have officially run out of band names , these guys are actually making fun of themselves without knowing it. Congratulations geniuses. More play dough coming out the conveyor belt here. As I have stated before most of these new rock bands all sound the same and their music is infinitely weak and has no vision , in fact most of it sounds like christian rock yet they are supposed to be cutting edge. I am glad I grew up in the 60's and 70's , man we would have made fun of this stuff to no end. There is no personality to be found anywhere in this band , Creed, Nickelback, A Perfect Circle , Moron 5 , Hoobacrank , on and on... The same guy has to be singing for them . The mainstream industry is more abundant and futile than ever discharing one overproduced piece of garbage after another .This one will definitely be available at Walgreen's. Check your shorts boys!!"
1,its ben a whale,"I have not like this band butfore until there knew cd came out, 13 shadys of gray, it grat this isnt not grat tho, feel. I thankthat the cd isnt soundful, not good suck DUD! DUDE!!! Do not buy this or reckment id suck as!"
1,"A good cd, without the good.","I know this CD came out a few years ago, and i should have reviewed it then. But i have a good excuse, i heard this CD, then i fell asleep and just woke up. It is that boring. If you are considering buying this album. Don't. It is bad. Very, Very bad."
1,Why isn't there a zero star rating???,"... Well, there is no excuse for Aaron Lewis. The lyrics are very bland, very depressing, and almost boring. Most of these lyrics you can find in the average 13 year old's diary. The music is really below average. Yes there are some nice riffs here and there, and may almost convince you the guitarist is a ""breath of fresh air"" when in fact the majority of his guitar riffs are the same old, boring down-tuned chords dropped to a D tuning and lots, I mean LOTS of palm-muting. The bassist is faily good, and the drummer is too and that right there were probably the main reason I saved this album from giving it a no rating what-so-ever. ... Basically this is one of the most overrated band's in Mainstream Rock today. ..."
2,Some OK tunes,"Dysfunction blows this ablum to pieces, some OK songs, evryone thought these guys were the new band on campus, but they had two other albums. I dont like it because its been done."
5,Staind has broken the cycle...maybe not,"The cycle of generic sounding nu-metal outfits that is. This album is a sheer pleasure to listen to. Good riffage and powerful vocals. Definitely worth picking up.Update (7/6/2006)I don't think I have listened to a song off of this album in over three years. I was obviously taken with the melodic/anthemic nature of this album when it first came out. I still like the song Mudshovel off of their first album, but the rest of their music doesn't hold well against the test of time for me."
2,Dont Believe the Hype,"This is the problem with nu-metal.Bands like this give the genera a bad name.People who like death and speed metal wont even give nu-metal a chance because they hear staind songs on the radio and think all the bands are this week.The singer has no range,and the guitarplayer cant play.I wont even mention the drummer.This CD has songs that start out hard but then they go soft right away.Not that I dont like slow nu-metal songs...I do... and there are a few realy good slow songs on this CD ""It's Been A Whyle"" ""Epiphany"" and ""Outside"" are gret songs,the problem is even their harder songs(I say harder because there is not one song on the record i would conssider hard)are sorta....well.....soft.There are alot of Nu-Metal bands that are alot better and a whole lot harder than than these guys.Systematic has great hard rock songs and slow songs that are better than staind's...buy their CD leave this one for the Limp Bizkit crowd."
4,not the best but,"Break the Cycle isn't a good of an album as Dysfuntion but the album still has plenty of great songs like for you, pressure and safe. They did sort of mellow out with this album befcause break the cycle has less of that raw we heard on dysfuntion but the band seems to have grown in aspects with songs like fade."
4,Emotion at a personal level,"I've never actually been a fan of Staind until I saw the ""It's Been Awhile"" video on MTV, after hearing the song I figured the group had a laid back style with a touch of rock to add drama. I then heard the second single ""Fade"" and found that Staind reached a level to which other groups pass over. I can't say that I relate to many of the deep issues the group brings out, but a lot of the phrases can touch many people in the most delicate situations they've experienced. The flavor is mostly hardcore but some songs may give you a break from the sound such as ""Outside"". Though you can hear the drums and the guitar, if you buy the cd listen closely to the lyrics of the songs. This is definitely one of the best cds I have ever purchased."
3,I had to think a while,"This is the third Staind album and its upto par with the first one but is a step down from the last one. There are some good songs on this album such as ""Waste"" which Lewis deals with a fan's mother telling him how her son had committed suicide, its both angry and empathetic towards the situation. The rest of the album however is pretty bland. ""Its Been A While"" the hit single is a good tune, as is ""Fade"". The album starts to lose effect after that. All the songs drone into one another making it a bore and easy to get tired of. Aaron Lewis does have a good voice however, but its not enough to carry this album. If you want to pick up a good release and you're into this type of music I suggest ""Animosity"" by Sevendust."
4,Not to bad.,"I went out and got this Cd the first day it came out. I popped it in, and the first song blew me away. I liked the studio version of Outside.(without Fred Durst in the back being annoying) But as I got to listening to it, I noticed some of the lyrics types were just of the same genre. I mean let's add a little something new to the lyrics. I heard diffrent music to the same lyrics of Dysfunction. But since I only listen for the music not for the lyrics I liked the CD. I just wanted to put a warning out to those people who like pay attention to words should watch out. But for die hard Staind fans . . . ROCK ON WITH THIS CD!!!!"
2,boring noise,"This is nothing but ...,i`m sorry.I tryed to like this but i just can`t and i know why.I`ts a little thing called talent.These guys don`t have any.Sadly gone are the days when a band could put out heavy music with great lyrics,but they could do more then just make noise.Where are all of the guitar solos,or don`t these guys know about those.Avoid this at all costs if you have a brain bigger than 1 cell."
4,"Great songs, good album",There aren't anything but great songs on this album but somehow it all adds up to only a good album. It is hard to explain but this just isn't as good as their debut album. Though most would dissagree with me I have to insist that Epiphany is the greatest song on this album. A lot of talk is made about outside and it's been awhile along with others but Epiphany is the most emotional and powerful song on the album.
2,Epiphany,"If you like music, download Epiphany and don't bother with any of the rest of the songs on this CD. Epiphany is a beautiful, emotional song amongst a CD full of mainstream, mediocre ""metal"" music."
2,For those about to whine...I hate you.,"This is truly horrible. All Aaron Lewis does in the whole album is whine about how horrible his life supposedly is when he's filthy rich off of this [stuff]. The music is so simple, it's not even funny. But the worst thing is the whiny vocals. Don't get me wrong. Dysfunction was nothing great either. But at least he didn't whine as much and some of the guitar was heavy. This is just dumb. It isn't dark, it's dumb. ""Open your Eyes"" particularly bothers me because what are the chances that he even cares about what he is singing about. He probably thought it would make him seem like a more meaningful lyricist but it doesn't. ..."
5,grunge with feeling.,"I first heard of Staind when I was shopping in Hot Topic in NY and they were playing Break the Cycle. I bought it straight away. I have never heard a singer and band that put so much emotion and feeling into their music. Everyone can relate to the lyrics, and the music is grungey with feeling :o) It's easy to close your eyes and get lost in this cd. Don't be surprised if you're left feeling a little melancholy and questioning your life experiences after listening to and absorbing the lyrics to these amazing songs, especially the songs Epiphany and It's Been a While.. they have that effect.I would never part with this CD, it's a treasure."
3,good shtuff,"A little lighter than what I usually like to listen to, but these guys have a way of drawing you into their depressed world. Musically and lyrically very well done, though like I said...mellow. Avoid mixing with barbituates or alcohol, dangerous side effects could result!"
1,<whiny> baby,"This is one of the worst hard rock/heavy metal albums I have ever heard. All Aaron Lewis does is whine the whole time. i'm sick of all these bands that just whine (papa rouch, flaw, linkin park, etc.)plus every track is very simple which shows that there is NO talent here. very very pathetic im 20 something still cry about what my dad/mom did... I can't get over how horrid this is trust me don't buy it."
2,2 1/2 Stars,"I really don't know what to say, it isn't really that good, but doesn't suck either. The ""i hate my parrents"" crap gets old fast, and the song fade just plain out sucks. Get Dysfunction, it is a hell of a lot better.-FM"
3,OK BUT NOT REAL STAIND,"THEY SOLD OUT BIG TIME. NO MORE ANGER LIKE DYSFUNCTION AND TORMENTED. IT'S A GOOD ALBUM, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SELLUOT TO BE POPULAR, THEIR FIRST ALBUM WAS INSANE AND STILL MADE IT BIG AND GOT SOME RADIO PLAY. OH WELL THAT SEEMS TO BE THE TREND THESE DAYS, ONE GREAT ALBUM THEN THEY MELLOW OUT AND FALL INTO MEDIOCRITY FOR THE REST."
2,what happened to them??,"i used to love staind, for their music, and mostly for their lyrics. dysfunction and torment were excellent. i was so excited about the new album, and i got it, and i was so dissapointned. the best song on the cd is 'fade'. the rest of it is just contrived 'i'm so depressed..give me money' . now all the teenyboppers are going to buy the earlier albums and try to say 'they know what aaron's lyrics are talking about'. when they obviously don't in their popular, ambercrombie little lives. they are ultimately what ruined staind."
3,Good Comfortable shoe,"This shoe is very comfortable and seems to be well made. Unfortunately, I work in a restaurant and these are not slip resistant at all, and so I can't use them."
1,"DON'T BUY, smells like burnt garbage!","This is the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon! They're made of a strange plastic material that is obvious when wearing. Every time we're in the car with the heater on, the shoes make the entire car smell like burning trash. It's so nauseating, we drove with the windows down in Michigan in winter. I will never purchase anything like this again~ I would strongly suggest you don't either. I on;y give it a 1 star, because there is no 0 star option."
1,"Blisters, poor fit, shady return policy","I bought these in the shoe size I have always worn for the last 5 years, and when they arrived they were too small to accommodate my toes. I wore them for a day to try and stretch them out, and they gave me such terrible blisters that my socks turned red. I asked to return them or at least exchange them for a larger pair, and I was denied. It was money down the drain, and I am never buying Deer Stags again."
1,Great Shoes,"These are very nice shoes, they last a long time and this is the second time I have purchased a pair.- Correction: These were very nice shoes and they used to be very well made, but they got ""wise"" with the materials and now they are horribly made with very bad synthetic materials. I don't mind synthetic, actually prefer it, but not the one these shoes have. Steer clear at all costs! I hope they return their shoes after a year or so!"
1,Rip-off,"The shoe is fairly comfortable and inexpensive, and looks good at first. I couldn't figure out why it was such a value but after wearing the shoe, it does not appear to be leather but rather some kind of plastic. If dressing well at your work matters you want to avoid this. This is the last time I'll order the brand; this was the first time I'd ordered one."
1,Ugly color,Really red in color. Appears more brown online. Unhappy with the overall appearance of this shoe but I'm stuck with it.
5,Deer Stags shoes,"I've been wearing these shoes for many years. They are the best for comfort and cushion, yet a dress shoe. Great durability."
5,Deer Stags Men's Times Plain Toe Oxford,My husband spends ten hours a day on his feet and he really likes these shoes. Size 14 and comfortable are not always the easiest thing to find but these are great. Will definitely be ordering again.
2,Not The Deer Stags I Used to Know,"I bought my first pair of Deer Stags many years ago and immediately loved them. Back then, they were the most comfortable, high-quality shoes I had ever come across and they lasted years. Fast-forward to 2010, my beloved Deer Stags had finally worn out so I was thrilled to find them online at Amazon. What a disappointment! The drop in quality was immediately obvious as I got them out of the box. They weren't nearly as comfortable and within just a few months of sedentary office use, the outer shell was cracking and peeling badly. The sole also cracked and within 2 years, it was time to replace the entire shoe. By going cheap, Deer Stags has ruined a great product and their reputation."
1,Ouch.,"I bought these shoes because I've had good experiences with Deer Stags in the past. These shoes are not only plastic, but very painful to wear because they don't seem to break-in. I've worn these for the past 2 days, and the rear of the shoe cuts into your achilles tendon. Wore these shoes to work today and it was simply too painful to wear anymore. Will be returning these."
3,"Not for me, but seems like good shoe","I cant give a good or bad here. The sizing at a 9 was too big, and an 8 1/2 too small. First time in my life I couldnt find an appropriate size. I think th shoe would have been very comforable if they had sizing in order. These may work great for you though..."
1,Kills the back of your ankle! OUCH!,"The company touts their insert, and it's true. The insert is very nice, and helps keep your feet comfortable. HOWEVER, the shoe just KILLS your ankle/heel!! It literally rips up the skin at the back of my ankle and causes them to bleed. OUCH!I want to like them, but the pain is unbearable."
4,Good for the Price,I purchased these shoes for my 17 year ld son. He usually wears a size 14 but he said they were too small. So I went up a size to 15. The size 15 were way too big but overall the quality is perfect for a 17 year old that will not wera them very often.
2,Weary of mail order shoes,I had to get shoe stretchers for these. The ridge around the top protruded inwards and pressed into my Achilles tendon so I had to rig up the stretcher to flatten it out. I wouldn't have got them if I'd tried them on first. Hopefully it will hold after awhile longer then it will be a decent shoe.
1,"No delivery, no customer service","They have charged my credit card, and not responded with anything, including the purchase order of shoes, or answered inquiries I have entered via phone and e-mail. The shoes are now two months overdue...horrible company"
2,Nice looking but does not last,"After 2 months looked shabby (easy to scuff, heals top fraying), after 5 months shoes totally falling apart. In fairness I am hard on my shoes but usually get 9 months from shoes. Cannot recommend these shoes unless their going to be seldom used."
2,super comfortable and feel like I am wearing slippers.,Order the shoe on 5 Feb and received on 13 Feb. Great feel and good looking shoe. Only problem is there's a fold on top of the left shoe that doesn't look normal?????
5,Great Shoe,These shoes are casual enough for everyday wear but dressy enough for the office. Good value and very durable. Holds a good shine as well. Very Confortable to wear for long periods of time.
5,"Good shoe, buy new laces","I have had these shoes for a couple years now and have worn them frequently. I would suggest buying new skinnier laces for these shoes as the laces that come with it are my only complaint. They are too think and take away from how nice the shoe can be. The skinnier laces make the shape of the shoe and stitching come out well.The shoes are genuine leather on the upper.They fit true to size, but be aware that they are rubber soled, but for $50 you can't beat the price."
4,Comfortable,I bought these for my Dad and he says these are the most comfortable shoes ever. My mom say sthe color was off and they need to be polished before wearing as a dress shoes but overall he was happy.
4,Not bad for an herbal,"I have a 7 year old shepard that has seisures pretty bad and the meds the vet gave us don't always control them. I decided to give an herbal supliment a try and so far so good. It's a loose powder that can be sprinkled over food or added to water. I have noticed that the seisures have slowed way down. Sissy went from 2-3 a day to 1 very minor one in 2 days. I don't know if its the supliment, but the timing seems to supprot it. Also, Sissy is actually willing to take this supliment. Normally she will eat anything EXCEPT medication. I spilled some on the floot the first time I opened the bottle and Sissy licked it all up. In my opinion, it's worth the $16 (cost plus shipping)."
2,Doesn't dissolve in water.,"I was really hoping this would help my kitten with her seizures, but I can't get her to eat it! The ""powder"" is more like sand, and just settles to the bottom of the water bowl after stirring. This might work for a dog (since they tend to make such a mess when drinking!), but my cat rarely ever reaches the bottom of her water bowl. I also tried mixing with applesauce, and then again with yogurt. It made a weird paste, and she just wasn't having it. (She doesn't like canned food, but that might be a good option for some.) If any cat owners have found a better way to deliver it, I would still like to give it a try."
1,Giant Mammoth lays Giant Turd,"The first Explorers Club CD had some good moments, but face it, Trent Gardner cannot write a melody. His awkward writing style is even more evident on Raising the Mammoth.The last time I hated a prog CD as violently as this one was when I blew 25 bucks on The Collected Works of Schicke, Fuhres and Froehling. This is just aimless garbage that goes nowhere. The singers are listed as Gardner, Steve Walsh and James Labrie. Walsh sounds nothing like his Kansas days and the way he bellows now it sounds like he needs to clear some phelgm from his throat! Labrie, from Dream Theatre, is barely evident as he doesn't sing much in his signature high-regiser style. The three sing together often and their voices just do not blend together well. Sounds like a real mess!Everything about this disc just sounds ""ugly"" - the singing, the playing, the stupid melodies....ughhhh, save your money!"
3,Not Very Exciting,"If you're checking out this album, then you probably checked out ""Age Of Impact,"" the first Explorers Club album. If you have the first one, then you might as well get this one for your collection but I'll warn you, the band line up has changed, the songs are very dull and watered down in comparison to the first album and James Labrie from Dream Theater only sings for about two minutes of the entire album that is one hour long. Don't get me wrong, the album is okay but it is just not at all what I was anticipating. The first outing was much much better."
1,A Big Disappointment--Bad Music Played Well,"I can't describe how depressing this album was. Rather than exploring new territory in Prog-rock and Prog-metal, the album creates new cliches out of the use of existing cliches. Even though the list of musicians is a Who's Who in the Prog world, this can't save the album from descending (and very nearly from the first note) into complete self-parody.And the shredding isn't even *that* top-notch.Save your money, buy something else."
5,A great time capsule for the late 80's,"This CD captures the essence of a movement which has evolved into acid jazz and techno dance music. In the middle of the 80's, some rap artists and DJ's started producing some of their own compilations, thus the name ""House music."" This movement caught on in Belgium and the UK in 1988 and 1989, with the creation of New Beat. It was a quasi-hypnotic music with much emphasis on dark, sexual overtones and lots of heavy beat and drums. it was played in underground dance clubs and old, abandoned warehouses, sometimes degenerating into all-night drugfests, otherwise referred to as ""raves."" Although some of this culture was far from exemplary, its musical heritage and legacy are still apparent in today's techno and acid jazz movements. A great time capsule!"
1,Oh dear...,"I think that this album is, well...awful. It just doesn't sound like authentic Silmarillionish music. I may be under 13, but I know my Silmarillion, and this music just isn't right. Oh dear."
4,The Monk in the Garden,"This book arrived in good condition; however, I found it too technical for me. I think someone who has more science background might enjoy it."
4,"Informative, entertaining, just what I was looking for","Not much is known about Gregor Mendel. This book gives the reader a taste of his life, including the famous pea plant experiments. Enough science to make it interesting, not too dry to slow down the reading. It was just what I thought it would be."
2,Propagates a pernicious misconception,"Henig admittedly takes creative license to fill in some historical gaps, but she goes too far in propagating the misconception that Mendel sent a copy of his paper to Charles Darwin and that Darwin never read it. This urban legend (also brought up by other authors, such as Philip Kitcher) has made its way into newspaper articles and even textbooks. Catalogs of Darwin's library in the early 1900's and later made no mention of Mendel's paper. Instead, a secondary source by Focke that mentioned Mendel was in Darwin's library, with the relevant pages uncut. See Andrew Sclater's 2003 article in the Georgia Journal of Science."
5,Informative and engaging,"I thought I had read enough nonfiction history books to know what to expect -- edifying, but not entertaining. This book blew those expectations out of the water. Chock-full of information, yes, but also liberally sprinkled with anecdotes and slices of life from the times surrounding Mendel and his rediscoverers. It's downright funny at times. I came away with an understanding of the birth of genetics that I'd even never known I was missing, not to mention a renewed interest in the field, without ever really realizing that I was reading a work of historical scholarship -- those are dry. This was fun."
4,No more leaks,Hate tipping gas can to pour only to have it leak around the spout cap. This pretty much eliminates that as the can isn't tipped because of the pump. Wish tube into container was a bit longer
4,"Great IDE, but UML support is terrible","Great, functional IDE for true object-oriented development.However, the UML support is held together by glue and scotch tape with the included version of Visio 2002. Very poorly done, tedious and will not let you perform continuous round-trip engineering.For an outstanding UML/Editor solution, check out Together Control Center. Although written and focused towards Java, it is capable of modeling and generating C# and VB.NET code."
2,I don't think .NET is that great,"All .NET languages need interpretor. Even C.NET which is a shame. Such language as C usually used to develop apps closely interacting with OS. So there will be even less interaction between user created apps and system because now Microsoft tells us to do everything through interpreter. Just like crippled Java does! But difference between stuff written in Java and C is that you know what your C application does, but you can never be sure about your Java application because there is interpreter between you and system, another buggy layer that controls you and that you cannot control. I agree .NET might be convinient way for people who like everything easy or are afraid to explore, but The biggest flow is that it takes control out of your hands convincing you that you are in control.Usual Microsofts trick!"
3,Ok if your English is pretty good,"This is the only item you should buy if you feel confident about taking the CBT TOEFL test, that is your English is already pretty good. The GUI is the same as test day so at least there is no suprise. I could not get the program to work under WIN98 SE, the sound would not come on. However, and very surprisingly, it works fine under XP!In sum, try to buy it used because it is not worth paying the full price."
4,A Welcome Reissue/Expansion,"This album is essentially a deluxe reissue of Doc and Merle's Pickin' the Blues (1985). Rounding out the tracks from that album are four choice cuts from Red Rockin' Chair (1981) and three fine instrumentals from Doc and Merle's Guitar Album (1983). Also included is a nice, but non-definitive, live rendition of ""Deep River Blues"" from The Festival Tapes / Tellulive (1979). This is a great sampling of the material Doc and Merle recorded for Flying Fish Records before Merle's untimely death on October 23, 1985. For those new to Doc's music, I would suggest exploring Doc's Vanguard recordings (On Stage, Southbound, Home Again, Ballads From Deep Gap) before you venture into this material. For those already familiar with Doc's early work and are looking for a good sampler of Doc and Merle's stint with Flying Fish, this is the best you're going to do."
4,A Special Glimpse of Doc,"These are not necessarily the Doc Watson standards we know and love, but there is wonderful music here by two phenomenal musicians. If you are a Doc Watson fan, there's a special feeling knowing he's communicating with us and his son at the same time."
2,Employees obviously don't care.,"Had to return first mail box as one of the boards was cut incorrectly, not securely glued. It popped out and warped.Shipping was very fast. Replacement also arrived quickly. Holes in wood do not line up with holes on mail box andone of the boards is short, but we will make do. Nice product if it was manufactured correctly."
2,Quality Control Unsatisfactory,"A week after I purchased and installed the mail box, two of the cedar wood strips fell off from the mail box. They were not attached to the mail box with sufficient adhesives and apparently they were not tested by the manufacturer. Obvious lack of quality control. I would not recommand this product."
5,Easy installation,"My old mailbox of 16 years had finally given up. Several of the slats did not survive the winter so I purchased this one based on the recommendation of my home owner's assoc. I was not disappointed. Installation was a breeze, and I got my better half to stain it (and the post!). The flag is a bit flimsy, just a flexible piece of plastic. The previous box had a metal flag, and I like that, but it did rust up a bit. Overall, this is a well built box and well worth the price."
1,0 for 2 on this item,First shipment was dented bent door wouldn't work so I sent it back and second item was the same so I got a refund. I wouldn't get this item again. Poor construction and shipping preparation.
4,The Cynical Person's Guide to Web Publishing,"An entertaining book, no doubt, but highly subjective and cynical. The author is obviously not a Microsoft fan (a lot of NT bashing) and he doesn't have much good to say about the Unix camp, or for anything else for that matter.The excessive use of sarcasm makes the book fun to read but it's obvious that the author has spent way too much time in the academia.If you don't know anything about web database publishing, after you read this book, you still won't. But it's fun reading and there's some good web secrets here and there. I enjoyed it anyway.The author is certainly a knowledgeable person and does a good job telling you what's wrong with the current tools. Unfortunately, he doesn't tell you how to fix them. Get it for the laughs."
4,Not just for web geeks...,"This book totally rocks.Greenspun's writing is not just refreshingly honest and dazzlingly authoritative but it is also humorous. I am still trying to figure out how this book got published as a geek manual for people who want to build relational databases. Who cares? The true value of this book (and the reason to have a copy next to your toilet or on your coffee table if you are one of those rare geeks who actually entertains) is Greenspun himself: he is the Master of irreverence and kept me thoroughly engaged, even when telling me things that we all already know (like that most web sites really, really suck).There is definitely something wrong with the people at Macmillan who are selling this book as just another ""how to"" technical manual. Don't they realize this is actually a soon-to-be cyber classic? I suggest you cancel your subscription to WIRED and buy this book instead. Rock on internet publishers."
2,Childish adults don't work Woody!,"Husbands and Wives is a film written, directed, and starring Woody Allen. I like Allen's insane writing but I just hated this 1992 drama with a passion. The characters are annoying, bitter, and childish to say the least. Judy Davis and Mia Farrow (in her last Allen film) are extremely unlikable in this film, you never root for them to find happiness. Juliette Lewis is the only actor who makes a good impression, her direct awkwardness is simply adorable. If you want a great Woody Allen film, try Annie Hall or Manhattan."
2,Watching people fight is a laugh riot?,"I'm a big Woody Allen fan, but this movie gaves me the creeps... Mostly, it is a series of arguments where the viewer feels like they're watching something very ugly happen right before their eyes. I certainly wouldn't call it comedy. I love every Woody Allen film except this one, I almost couldn't finish watching it; I felt so terrible when it was through."
2,Drawings in Original Are Left Out of This Edition,"The book is delightful, but this particular edition does not contain Belloc's drawings that were in the original. This is a serious drawback because the drawings -- some of which are maps -- aid in one's understanding of his story. Without the drawings, I feel like this is only half a book. I would recommend that you buy a different published version that contain his drawings, even if you have to buy an older used copy."
5,Francis Quinlan's Comment,"Written early in the 20th century, this story of a walking trip to Rome is still one of the most compelling travel books ever written. What makes it interesting is that the reader is in the company of an erudite and educated man who is thoroughly human. Recommended. FJQ"
4,Travels,"As an old traveller, who likes Hilaire Belloc, this book is fun.It describes his trip to Rome, the people he met, and the places he passed through (on foot)!"
5,"A story of war, and a story of life","Suicide Charlie is a moving, well-written account of a young man's journey to Vietnam and his return to the U.S. The story is a lucid account of war, but it also transcends the typical 'war story,' and delves into the author's personal life, his family, and the state of the country at the time. I really couldn't put it down. This is one of the best memoirs I've had the pleasure to read."
2,"Another anti-war, anti-American hippie's rant against the US military","Russell recounts his life in the Vietnam-era US Army from induction to post-discharge years. He makes no pretense that he hates the military nor does he hide the fact that he was/is a pot-smoking, anti-establisment hippie. Buy this book only if you are well read in the history of the Vietnam war from many different aspects, but do not take it solely as factual from Russell's perspective as he admits he was stoned or spaced out much of the time whether in the field or in the rear on R&R.;We all suffered some psychological after effects from that damn war, but the vast majority of us got on with our normal lives after we got back to the world. Russell is hopelessly caught in his own time warp from Vietnam. He has a difficult time maintaining focus and quite often rambles to the point it is hard to follow his story and very often inserts flashbacks which totally lack continuity with his subject."
4,Cool watch for different people,"Since many years I have been looking for a digital sports watch with a different looks than the usual suspects (TIMEX, POLAR, NIKE, ADIDAS, SWATCH...you name it). I got my first experience 4 years ago, I bought my Freestyle SHARK model (which is basically MAKO now) and I was delighted!, however, a year ago my watch was stolen and I was convinced to buy another one which I did with the MAKO. I am not a 100% sporty person and therefore and I don't really use all the features, otherwise I would have bought any of the other brands mentioned, I bought this model because I wanted to wear a different watch with all the features. The only thing I complain is that it does not come with instructive and the one tha you get out from Internet are NOT the exact specifications. Other than that I feel really happy with it.Fernando GonzalezMexico"
3,Great Watch-but waiting on my 3rd band,"I love the watch its stylish, a nice big display to easily read but without the watch itself being oversized and clunky on my wrist. I have had it for about 5 years now and the watch itself still works great however the same can't be said for the watch band which is specific to the watch. I've broke 2 bands so far and am waiting on the 3rd one to be shipped to me right now. I can't complain too much though the band is only $12 to replace just a minor annoyance to deal with."
1,poor quality.,"Hi all,I bought a watch on September 2010 for my son but brazelete is now broken with only wear or normal use the watch, It did not last even a month, I really like the watch and my son loved it at the moment, now he is sad because he can not use it anymore and I am so dissapointed.I will be glad to receive any warranty, another brazelete to repair or somethig, it was not suppoust to last less than 3 months. TOO BAD!!Regards,Freddy"
1,No support from seller,"Received this item from seller within 7 days and posted review giving 5*.Now want to take this back.Strap broke within 7 days. Advised seller and sent photographs of failed item. Seller then took 4-6 weeks to send a replacement. Although I made contact with them every couple of weeks they continued to make excuses saying they were waiting on correct replacement strap, people off sick, but this ate of lot of time that I should have reported my A-Z Amazon Guarantee claim.When the replacement strap arrived it did not fit!!Foolishly, I gave seller another 8 days to fix. BIG MISTAKE. Should have filed claim right away.Now Amazon saying this is beyond the timescale.Do not buy anything from this company. It is run by people with a common age of 12 and probably stocked from their garage.Appalling back-up and customer service.Without naming names.......you know who you are Mike."
1,Return of Freestyle watch,The watch didn't work out as we expected. It began to come apart after just 4 weeks of use but the customer service I received from SwingSomeWhere was OUTSTANDING! I would definitely do business with this company again. I rated this a 1 because of the quality of the watch which is a reflection on Freestyle not SwingSomeWhere. They were wonderful to work with!
1,Piece of crap!,I am now probobly on my 6 or 7th watch..I like the watch itself but the band ALWAYS breaks and the watch itself has many issues with the buttons not working to reset the time...leaking...band breaks within a 3 month period!So far all have leaked and I take the backs off to dry out.... then the buttons stop working ...then the band breaks!I even sent one back for leaking and they sent back the watch saying it was fine..16.00 down the pike cuz it leaked just washing my truck a month later..and then the band broke!...oh and the lighting stopped working too!I am not going to buy another unless they come up with at least another type of band as i can deal with the other delayed issues but when the band breaks your done!!..Sucks for them!...and me!....Great business model HUH???
2,broken bands hard to replace,"Love these watches, but after breaking a second band I may just have to give up on Freestyle. Its about impossible to find a replacement band. They could make a killing if they just offered these at retail stores because they tend to break pretty easily. The strap is unique to the watch so you will not find another like it anywhere else. No ""one size fits most"" here. My first mako had a metal band that broke, couldn't find a replacement so I bought a plastic band. Now it has broken after about 2 years of minimal use. Show me where to find a quick easy and cheap replacement and I will give this thing 4 stars!"
1,watch band breaks every time,I've owned 4 or 5 of these and I think they are now making the band out of cheaper stuff because the last two broke within two months of purchase. Don't buy it!
1,Watch band broke in a few months and customer service stinks!,I purchased this watch in November 2011 and in March 2012 the watch band broke. I called customer service and they informed me that the watch band was not covered under warranty. Then they told me that I could purchase a new band for $15.00! I only paid $29.00 for the watch! The same exact watch band can be purchased from a third-party company for $11.00. Customer service and quality are very poor in my opinion.
2,Don't get it for the PDF viewer.,"I have been searching for a PDF viewer on the Palm that was better than the Adobe version, which had nasty text and wouldn't fill the whole screen on my Tungsten T3. PDF to go, part of the DTG package, advertised that it would do this. I bought it. It is worse than the Adobe one - it misses out any pictures that are part of the PDFs, and the text is still nasty.I then did a Google search and found a freeware PDF viewer that works perfectly.Make what you will of this.The word files are great on it, though."
2,not impressed,"I was interested in this book because of the cover model, whose hair is somewhat like my own. Unfortunately, I couldn't find information on the model's hair type anywhere within.Contrary to the title of the book, the author does NOT provide tips for ""Any Hair Type"". The author appears to assume that all Black women have only variations of kinky hair, which simply isn't so. Also, the author doesn't seem to realize that some chronic scalp conditions really DO need to be under the care of a licensed medical professional (seborrheic dermatitis, for example, which can get quite severe and require medical care).A waste of money, in my opinion."
5,The Best Black Hair Care Book,"Every black woman, whether they have hair problems or not, should read this book. I have read many books on black hair care, and this one is by far the most thorough and educational. The concept of cleansing the mind in order to have better hair was intriguing and helpful. I never knew that negative thoughts could transfer into negative hair. The section on hair care products was very helpful in choosing the right shampoo and knowing when to use a moisturizer and when to use an oil. This book was excellent, and I commend Lisa Akbari on her effort."
2,Not Very Good! Don't Waste Your Money!,"The book was not very well organized. It promised so much, but delivered nothing. I just got done reading it and I really did not get much out of it. There was nothing new to take from the book. The author repeated herself a lot. Do yourself a favor and find another book."
3,Mediocre,"There are better books that go more in depth when it comes to African American hair. It's not a bad book; it's just mediocre and you can do better. Try ""Let's Talk Hair: Every Black Woman's Personal Consultation for Healthy Growing Hair"" or ""Good Hair: For Colored Girls Who'Ve Considered Weaves When the Chemicals Became Too Ruff"""
5,Best Book Ever Written on Black Hair,"I have read several books on black hair care, but I must say, in all honesty, this is the absolute best ever written. I couldn't put this book down. It was very easy reading. However, I was shocked and amazed at the information she reveals in this book. I have purchased several copies for my family and friends and their responses were all the same, ""a great book!"""
5,A great wake up call,"This movie is a great wake up call for how high school can be. Most high schools aren't as extreme as the one in this movie, but there are high schools out there that this could happen in."
5,Excellent,"I hated Elephant, and Heart of American is much better. It's more real, has better acting, and more intriguing. Clint Howard is great in a character that he hardly plays. Shocking and great - words to describe Heart of America."
2,Boring,"While I am not a mushy romance reader, I have read several of her books for the goofy comedy. This one started out great, but fell short and got boring after the first couple of chapters. It had the ""on and on"" effect for me. Defintely not one of her better books."
3,something missing,"I read the book without stopping.It was really flowing,but there was something missing in the end.I felt like there should have been one more chapter in the end."
4,Great fast read,"I liked this book, I found the two main characters, as well as Alex's brother Max to be very likable. The only thing I didn't like was the ending, it felt rushed to me. The changes in Alex weren't believable to me, the way he rushed into things. Other than that, great read!"
3,Face the Truth,"This is not my favorite Crusie book, but it is still a good one. I like Crusie's characters because they have some flaws to work around. They aren't the perfect people we see on TV. This book is about the need to sometimes throw away preconceived notions and insecurities and see ourselves as other people might see us. I'd say the book starts out somewhat superficial, but gains a story line as it moves along. The audio version is well read by Susan Ericksen."
2,Disappointing,"What makes Jennifer Cruisie stand out is her ability to create effortless dialog between her characters, especially between the two destined to be together. I felt the connection made by the characters in this book was mediocre, especially when it came to intimacy scenes there was an uncomfortable forced aspect to it which really killed the scenes for me. If you are new to Jennifer Cruisie, read Bet Me which is a much better book..."
2,Story good: graphic sex unnecessary!,Chose this book for a light-hearted Kindle read based solely on the book description blurb and noting the customer reviews positive (of the ones I read). Was enjoying the story and the author's style (having never read any of Cruisie's works). What a surprise to discover this a (UGH) Harlequin Romance - not my cup of tea.
2,"sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but i was bored",I found this book to be cliched and a little boring. So unlike this author.
1,BORING AND REDUNDANT,"I thought I'd NEVER get through this one...ALL BUT THE LAST FEW PAGES were about the 'heroine' whining over having feelings for her younger neighbor and how very inadequate she felt. I really wished one of them would have moved and put me out of my misery but they finally got together at the very (very) end, by then I could not have cared less."
4,Fantastic Listen!,"The audio version of this book is short, it's laugh-out-loud funny, and it's good enough that I've listened to it twice.Nina Askew is 40 and recently divorced. Alex Moore is an ER doc, ten years younger than Nina, and living in the apartment beneath hers. Fred is a lumpy, morose basset hound, recently saved from the needle. The three characters spend a lot of time watching old movies, eating Oreos and falling in love (Nina and Alex do, at least). I'm not usually a May-December romance fan, but the chemistry between Nina and Alex is fantastic.Susan Ericksen does a great job on this one - the characters each have their own identity and her comedic timing is perfect. She also voices all the Eve Dallas books (Treachery in Death), for those of you who are interested.For those of you who think audio books are boring or who've never really tried one, 'Anyone But You' is the perfect short introduction."
5,Loved it !!!!!,"This was the best and most fun book I have read in a long time.I was so in love with Fred the dog, I wish I could have pulled himout of the book and kept him! It was hard not to laught out loudwhen I was reading in public. This book was just plain fun to read.I am enevious of anyone who has not read it yet, you have fun ahead!"
3,"Okay, not as good as JC's others...","Cute story, but not near as funny, as hot, nor as memorable as her other books. I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars if that was possible. I'll definitely keep reading her though."
5,Couldn't put it down,"First time book reviewer, but I loved it. May not be too realistic, but when it comes to the ""happily ever after"" type books, they rarely are. Snuck in some reading during work because I couldn't wait to see what happened next."
3,funny but ...,"I couldn't wait to purchase this new book by Jennifer Crusie. I've loved reading her last three books (and some older books as well) and was looking forward to reading this one.Alas... a very small, relatively thin book arrived.The story, sure: it's funny, it's nice that it features an older women and a younger man, but having gotten 'used' to stories like the ones in ""Bet Me"" en ""Fake It"" I was disappointed.Does not mean you shouldn't read it, but for me; I'm going to make sure that new books are indeed néw and not old wine in new bags!"
3,okay romance,"After getting divorced at age 40, Nina Askew moves into an apartment and plans to get a puppy to keep her company. Instead she ends up with Fred, a smelly and depressed beagle/bassett hound cross. Fred is instrumental in her meeting her downstairs neighbor, the ER doctor Alex. They are meant to be together, but Alex and Nina both think the other party won't be interested because of the age difference - Alex is ten years younger than Nina. The characters are likeable, especially Fred, but the book was rather predictable. At the end there are some easily-resolved misunderstandings thrown in that seem to be there just to make the book reach the 200-page mark."
5,So Funny,"Personally, I loved this book. The first reason I loved it was because I am also an owner of a Basset Hound. The second reason, it was just so funny. Jennifer is such a great writer. Her books are all funny and interesting. They never are the same."
4,Fun Little Book,"This book was really cute! I'm a dog fan, so I was quite proud of ""Fred"" in this book. Even though it was lighthearted, the story still made me turn inward and think about some things in my own life. The only thing I would have changed would be to describe Nina and Alex's hookups in a bit less detail. Other than that, this romantic story was lots of fun!"
4,Fun,Jennifer Crusie writes fun books. Though a light read are perfect for the beach or if your really busy.
3,Crusie Newbie,"This is the first encounter with a novel by Jennifer Crusie. I borrowed this in digital audio format from our library.The narration was ""ok"", but not as robust as some novels I have listened to.The story was cute, humorous and kept me hanging on til the end although you kinda saw it all coming.Good book, even better on audio."
5,Fast becoming a new Crusie Fan!,"I recently read a book written by Jennifer crusie and fell in love. Her books have a fun, sexy, witty feeling. I start reading them and dont want to stop until the last page. This book I loved espically becasue of the dog. If you are a dog lover you will get a kick out of how this book has been written around the dog!"
5,Very funny & sexy,Anything by Jennifer Crusie is an excellent read. She does romantic comedy extremely well.
4,Great book even if it's not a newly written one,"I love Jennifer Crusie. I've read all her books except for the ones that are out of print so when this one became available I couldn't wait.I didn't think any book could compare to her other book ""Welcome to Tempation"", my all time favorite, but this one did a wonderful job. It is a short book but it really gives a wonderful involved story that wanted to make you keep reading.I highly recommend this book along with any of her others. Ms. Crusie is an exceptional writer and I can't wait for new stories."
5,A little gem!,"I'm thrilled to find this old favorite on Amazon. It was out of print for decades. Now Amazon carries a new edition, but for sentimental reasons, I prefer this old edition with the original jacket. I discovered it back in 1967, as a teenager on my first job as an assistant at the local branch library. My taste in books was adult then, and I relished this story of three eccentrics who come out of nowhere to sell Instant Gold. The effects on the government, free enterprise, and the global economy are amusing, to say the least. This short novel has a little romance, a little mystery, and lots of dry wit. Treat yourself to it! Enjoy!"
5,Absolutely required reading,"This is one of the most engaging, well-written books I have had the pleasure to read. Logical, thorough, and persuasive. Every person should read this book. With the measured prose of an intelligent person, Mr. Clayton manages to present his case without being dogmatic. I simply do not see how the existence of a Divine Creator could be denied after someone examines this work. Scientists and theologians can not only live side-by-side, but can buttress each other's finds."
1,The Author does not know what he is doing when it comes to Science and Math,"Well I didn't read the whole book, just the first few chapters where he tries to come of with a number for Human inhabital planets in the Universe. After I saw the pathetic way he used science and math to attempt to come up with answers, I just threw the book away. The Author clearly does not have enough of a Science or Math background to write a book like this where he tries to prove things using science and math.I have wrote this book off as a complete JOKE!"
2,DUDE 420 YO!!!,"Ok, I got this disc and the release show, they were the headliners. But however, Logans Loss took the show for me, having seen them before at the Fireside with Lawrence Arms. Seriously go buy the new Logans Loss cd, forget this CD although its halfway decent"
5,This CD is a regular in my player,"This CD deserves 10 out of 5 stars. It is probably my favorite CD in my whole collection, followed by the other LBC cd's. This CD has it all, everything from Punk, to Reggea, to Ska, to Hip-hop. This band is incredibly versatile, and deserves much more recognition than they get. Its not everyday that a CD comes out that I can listen to all the way through without skipping a track. I never skip tracks on this CD, they are all awesome! When I first got this CD, I dont think it left my CD player for at least a month, and it goes back in all the time.You really do need to check this CD, and the rest of the LBC discs out, they are well worth anything, you will be amazed."
5,super duper sweet arse ear candy,"lucky boys confusion sound is eclectic. it caters to a wide range of genres... which is refreshing today, in a world so full of cookie cutter sound. this cd makes u want to get up and shake what ur mother gave you... non-stop! the only thing better than listening to LBC cds is to experience them live. the energy from their shows is amazing. i highly recommend that u see them if you have the chance!"
5,Best is yet to come!,"I must say, I have been a Lucky Boy fan for a while now, and i think that this is a great cd. The tracks mix well and there a bit of everything in there. There is a wide range of music with many different influences you can hear. For a hometown band they are great and I can't wait to hear more of their music."
5,bet on it,"A couple weeks ago my friends e-mailed me to settle a bet between them about which album was better, lbc's ""throwing the game"" or weezer's new green album. I hadn't heard ""throwing the game"" but I almost didn't even give it a chance because weezer had been stuck in my CD player ever since it came out. But I bought ""throwing the game"" anyway. Thank god. I love the green album, but I REALLY love ""throwing the game."" It's a must for anybody who loves fast, upbeat, reggae-ska-punk style music. Attention Sublime fans--Buy this record! Seriously, this should be everybody's soundtrack to the summer of 2001. Perfect party music."
5,420 geekin' it,"ok well i would give this cd like a million more stars but i can't SO.. yes this cd rocks. I couldn't wait till i got it and haven't stopped listening to it since. most of the songs are from their older cd's but they still sound good. breaking rules is the best song! Stubhy's got a great voice and him and adam kick it hard on songs like ""3 to 10"" and ""Child's play"". I highly recomend you get this cd. They're a great band...They put on a killer live show. oh and before i leave. Someone said that lbc was from naperville; some of the guys are from Naperville and some are from Downers Grove.. just so ya know. oh and... ""Fred Astaire"" is NOT a love song"
3,To Small,"We thought it would be a little larger, But it is okay for now. We purched a larger one and love that one"
3,Disappointed with the production of the book,"I expected more from the production of the book. Yes, it contains the complete text of ""An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,"" but:1. There is nothing else, not even a page giving the year in which David Hume first published it.2. There are numerous formatting errors. For example, in several places a paragraph is broken in the middle of a sentence.3. Footnotes are put in the body of the text rather than at the bottom of the page.On the other hand:1. A decent sized font has been used, so the text is easy to read.2. The book is printed on high quality paper.In retrospect, I wish I had bought a book with an editor's introduction."
5,Definately the Best of Rockers and Ballads,"I am a diehard Scorpions fan and this is my favorite CD. I can listen to it from start to finish without having to skip through any bad songs.This CD mixes their best soft ballads such as ""Holiday"" and ""Still Loving You"" with the bone crunching riffage of tracks like ""Big City Nights"" and ""The Zoo"".I am a very critic critic, but i have found no flaw with this compliation of music and masterpice."
3,LL gone Gangsta.............,Not a mainstream hit but had some joints on here.Top Tracks:Back SeatPink CookiesHow I'm CominFunkadelic RelicBuckem Down
3,Let's swing an episode,"LL Cool J was at the top of his game in 1990 with the classic ""Mama Said Knock You Out"". ""14 Shots"" I guess is supposed to be the follow-up but it disappoints. I expected the usual LL when I popped in this disc, but I just couldn't find it. Instead he's trying a little too hard to impress the new hip hop ""gangsta"" generation, instead of just sticking to his stuff. Obviously, his greatest strength is his soulful songs for the ladies, but only one (""Stand By Your Man"") appears here. The album falls flat with songs like ""Straight from Queens"" and ""Diggy Down"". The heavy bassed ""Back Seat"" is the only classic on the album, but songs like ""All We Got Left is the Beat"" and ""Funkadelic Relic"", where he makes early claims that he's the greatest rapper of all time, give ""14 Shots"" its moments. Clearly, it's not one of LL's best but at least he came back strong with ""Mr. Smith""."
3,MUCH BETTER,"L always displays great mic skills, however this album was a lot better produced. This is LL how he should be. There a maybe 3 or 4 cuts he could have done with out."
1,Time Life .........................,"I bought ""this"" album back in time as part of my collection and the tracks now shown are not those on their ""smooth Jams"" Cat # R794-05."
1,I want my 101 minutes back!! This movie was beyond terrible!,"I watched this movie because of all of the hype in the local Dallas, TX area over this film, and another she had coming out. I was extremely disappointed because this film was nothing more than a porn gone bad. Willa Ford cannot act to save her life. I've seen better cinematography from a 1st year film student. Don't waste your time or money on this flop. You will thank me. I'll think twice before I ever watch another movie that this ""actress"" is in. Mo you could have done way better than her. I hope you were smart enough to get a prenup!"
4,my opinion on the Professional Dominoes,"The Professional Dominoes I purchased was a xmas gift for my son, he said they are good, but I myself would have preferred a case for them."
2,same ol' same ol',"Slightly more creative than AWAKENING, but not by much. There is money to be made here, however. I am sure there will be other pieces to follow by Curiale. Hope to see some definitive innovations in future compositions."
3,nice surprise,"This CD was a nice surprise since I bought it kinda blind. I had heard one song from Joseh Curiale which I really liked. I was looking for some symphonic work with strong rhythmic percussive support. I was not disappointed. After this CD I also bought another CD from him and I found out that he reuses a lot of themes. Having said that, it remains great music with strong melodic lines, at times spiritual and always pleasant to listen to. You can listen to it when everybody is out of the house and you are alone having your stereo at maximum volume or play it on the background past midnight."
2,Not so banana,in my opinion this doesn't taste so great. of course it's hard to do artificial banana. but this artificial banana is a loser for me. I'll stick with creamy chocolate which is wonderful thank goodness.
5,Great,These protein drinks are the bomb! They taste great and the nutrition facts are better than any other RTD I've had!
5,Consumer in Texas,Have ordered Vanilla and also Strawberry. Both are delicious and with 35 grams of protein at 160 calories - this makes them perfect for my needs. Will always reorder.
3,It was just okay...,"I think the banana flavor was overwhelming for me because I normally have issues with drinking protein anyway, so combined I was not impressed. I think had I gone with vanilla it would not have been quite as bad for me. The protein in it was GREAT for what I needed it for and could tell it was working, but the taste was dreadful. I would only recommend to those with strong stomachs or who are VERY used to drinking protein. Note of caution: must drink fast! The left over fluid on the lip gets hard very quickly (similar to an egg) and is unappetizing when you pick the drink back up to start drinking again."
3,Too artificial for me!,"The taste is just okay. I love that it has 35 grams of protein and 1 carb. This is what motivated me to get it in the first place. But I'm unable to get past the artificial ingredients and coloring. Don't think I'll buy it. Gave it 3 stars for the protein amount and for extra low in carbs. I hope to find a shake that is high in protein (at least 30 grams), low in carbs and fat and is way more natural."
1,I'd rather drink from a septic tank.,"The shake is watery and makes me want to chug a gallon of bleach to remove the horrific aftertaste. It also contains soy, which is an ESTROGEN! I just bought these for the extra protein, but if I were a guy interested in building muscle, the last thing I'd drink is something with (essentially) estrogen in it (which, by the way, is also bad for women to consume, unless you like cancer). Even if you don't find the taste as foul as I do, do some research before you consider eating hormones (i.e., soy). It's my fault for not reading the ingredients, but this product does not deserve favorable reviews with regard to flavor. *Shudder*"
3,MasterView Executive Desktop Stand,"Item arrived quickly, in good condition. When filled up, it is not very sturdy. It would be best to anchor it, so that it does not tip over."
2,Basic,"Extremely basic with inconsistant layout. Entire sections will be printed with a blue background, for example, that look more like a special topics box then text. In several cases the text reuses its stock photos in several unrelated sections. The text illustrates points that clearly do not need illustration (Do you know what water looks like? There is a photo of it if you need it. ) and ignores others (the beta and alpha linkages of glucose) after dicussing them. Good for high school student concepts but unacceptably uncomprehensive for college."
5,Excellent classical Thriller Horror,Watched this film countless times as a kid at my grandmothers house it was the double feature with psychomania watched it so much that the tape was actual worn out and difficult to watch with constant tracking. But this dvd is not only a better picture more clear sound but has commentary from the director which gives alot of insight to the film love this movie.
4,Relatively scary whodunit,"This 1979 film is famous mostly for a brief appearance by Brooke Shieldsas a preteen sister of Alice. The question concerns whether Alice isthe murderer of her younger sister, and if not, who? Some good scaresalong the way, but because the answer is revealed well before the end,the suspense is undercut, and the ending, while okay, is not as good asthis type of film requires to be top-notch. Still, worth a look if youlike this genre."
1,LOL,"they should have put a a sticker on the box saying: "" may cause sleepness "" the mask looks like a michael myers mask rip-off! and the yellow slicker is like the black slicker from I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. and this movie is boring as hell! and they switch from this killer to another?! ROFL. this is lame! soooo lame!!"
3,it pretty good,"another vintage horror. it not that suspenseful and doesnt have elaborate deaths in it. there is only one death scene that is abit brutal. its when a guy gets smashed in the head to death with a big rock. the only true positive things about it are its a ""who done it slasher"", and if u want to offend someone religiously this movie is for u."
2,is this the same MOVIE????,"The beginning was pretty good but it got so strange, and I found myself asking.....How did that other killer get a mask like Karen? You can tell the difference between ALICE and KAREN one's fat and the other is not!"
2,I didnt like it,"Dysfunctional Catholic family, 10 yr old Karen 'Brooke Shields' is killed during her communion afterwards her innocent sister becomes a suspect. Then more people start being attacked in the building she lived in. Was it really the sister or someone else who did this? This one was something else... I didnt understand it. It was too confusing, it wasnt scary, just didnt do it for me. Too much of a soap opera plot and issues going on in this one."
3,"Alice, Not So Sweet Alice","Being a big slasher fan, I decided to check this movie out. I bought the Anchor Bay collector's edition of this movie and I love the Widescreen format on it and the digitally remastered format is great. Anyaway, what do I have to say about this movie. It's very slow. I had to skip past a lot of talk scenes in this film. The death scenes however are good but there's not a lot of slashing in this movie which is upsetting. It's an okay movie. Nethertheless, I'm still keeping it."
4,Strange Twists,"I enjoyed this movie .Very stange because it keeps you wondering who the killer really is.I thought it was Alice ,but it didn't turn out that way. At the end I like the way Alice gets the bag from the killer .It reminds me of Halloween 4 when mike myers neice turns into him at the end."
5,makes me scared to go in a catholic church!,"I first saw this when i was young and i have seen it several times since then and it still freaks me out! this is one of those films they need to make more of!Its about a family living a nightmare when a person in a yellow raincoat and mask begins killing off parts of their family. all the evidence points to Alice(excellant played) but is it really her? the twists and turns keep coming and the end is a shocker. everyone in this film does an excellant job. excellant direction, acting, and that creepy music. like i said, they dont make movies like this anymore and they should! recommended highly"
2,"An important topic, but a disappointing collection.","There is a desperate need for more dialogue on queer religiosities. I wish I could endorse this book as an effort to connect queer identity with buddhist practice.Unfortunately, this book displays almost no consciousness of the class oppression, racism, and sexism that create the conditions that allow for homophobia to exist. This is a shame because the buddhist insight of interconnectness could speak so eloquently to these connections. But ultimately it seems this is a book written by and for privileged white males.For those desperately seeking validation of their sexual orientation, Queer Dharma may provide affirmation. But the true dharma is intended to challenge us beyond our own limited identity and privilege. This book deserves credit for taking the initial steps to establish dialogue, but it could have been much better."
5,It works.,"I am usually always asleep by the second track; make sure it is not too loud though and put the CD on repeat all to repeat all the tracks and make sure you are ready to go to sleep, take a hot bath, relax with some warm de-cafe tea and put your mind to rest and the CD will relax you and you will fall asleep. I use it every night. It does work, again, I stress if you are not used to going to sleep with sounds try lowering the volume, if you have a partner ask them for a light massage while you listen to the CD. My Husband does this sometimes when I have had a stressful day to help Me drift off to sleep quicker. Seriously you should be close to asleep by the 2nd or 3rd track."
5,Calling all fellow insomniacs!.....,"After months of getting really only mediocre sleep each night and waking up still feeling shattered, I thought I'd try this CD out. I liked the fact that it was grounded in scientific theory, and after only one night I was hooked. In fact, I slept so deeply I could hardly wake up the next day! I have since bought this CD for friends and family who are similarly afflicted, and have loaded it onto my IPOD so that I can increase the odds of a better night's sleep on overnight flights. Give it a go!"
4,Sleep Deeply,This disk did what is is supposed to do. We use it to go to sleep on a regular basis. I still haven't heard the end as I am fast asleep before it is over.
5,I've never heard the end of this CD.,"When I put this CD on my Head Phones, which is how you should listen to this CD, I've never stay awake long enough to hear the end of this, and I've never been a person that falls asleep fast. Some nights I can lay awake for 2 hours, and more. And I have to say that I'm a light sleeper, but after listen to this, and falling a sleep, wow what a deep sleep I went into, and slept though the night.I've seen that Dan Gibson all so has two other sleep CD's with I'm going to buy also. This really works, and I'm a person that lays down and the mind never shuts up. And if your like me, you know what I'm talking about.I highly recommend this Sleep Deeply."
2,Ambient music Buff,Annoying..I had to turn it off. I could hear the background bass and it certainly wasnt relaxing. Tried to eliminate Bass input but still did not matter. Perhaps a more fluid interweave in the composition.
1,Deeply Disappointed,"The background music is good, however, the piano music throughout the CD is terrible! Calling it piano music is stretching it a bit. Single notes played very sharply with the occasional two finger chord.... sounds like a 6 year-old is playing it. Certainly not played by a true pianist. To top it off, the ""piano"" part is at least 5 times louder than the rest of the music. It certainly is not conducive to deep or any other kind of sleep in my opinion. There are many sleep CDs available, and if I had it to do over again, I would definitely pass this one up. I realize that most of the reviews here of ""Sleep Deeply"" are positive, and I won't disparage anyone else's opinion, but if you buy this CD, you will see that everything I've written here is true. Maybe it won't be as annoying to you as it is to me."
5,sleep deeply,Love it. It's one of my personal favorites to fall asleep to. I would highly recommend this for anyone suffering with insomnia.
5,Sleep Deeply CD,This our second purchase of this CD. We wore out the first one. It was seldom that we ever heard the second track! What a wonderful drug-free sleep aid. Thank you for the prompt delivery and excellent quality of the disc.
3,Get the Difford solo CD...,it's simply much better and not a hit-or-miss attempt at writing 90s Squeeze songs.
5,I love this album,"Glenn has one of the sweetest voices I have ever heard. Just heart-melting! Sigh.I listen to this album over and over and over...UPDATE: I just saw Glenn perform last week (November 2009). He is amazing on guitar! I didn't realize how accomplished he is. He could seriously have a second (third, fourth??) career as a jazz guitarist.I have to say, most of the women there were, like me, in our late teens/early 20s when Squeeze was big in the 1980s. Can't speak for them, but I had a really big crush on Glenn and he still makes me sigh, even 20 years later! Love those twinkly eyes and boyish smile!And, of course, that voice!! : )"
1,wastie of money !!!!! :+(,"Tummy Tuck DON""T WORK!!!,Very small jar..only last's a week :+( S O R R Y!!!!"
1,Dont waste your money.,It doesn't work. It softens skin and that is all. You just need to watch what goes in your mouth and what comes out to lose weight.
2,Tummy Tuck Cream,"Have used this cream for 3 weeks........not showing much, if any changes in tightness.......unless I put a waist belt on with it....."
2,Album Lacks Teeth,"If you are a hardcore Tool fan the way I was and really dug Aenima and Undertow then this probably isn't the album for you. I was disappointed with Lateralaus and even more disappointed with 10,000 Days. The album is just soft. I think Tool is on the Metallica path and will soon be recording Brittney Spears covers. I know it's sad but it's true."
3,Too much filler...may take a while to get used to sound,"The 3 or 4 non-filler songs on this album are good but not great. I have to disagree with many of the people who have reviewed this album so far and said it was awesome or any similar thing. It's not...the filler songs are moody music that perhaps could play in the background while i was doing something else. This is not what i expected, although Tool never really does the expected and thats what makes them great. Perhaps after a few more listens i'll learn to love it, but so far just not enough rock...who knows in a week or two i may like the album better than the other Tool releases, thats usually how great progressive bands work. However, i would say buy it for the packaging alone...Awesome packaging. Like i said though...it is sub-par for Tool...but that still means its better than most of the junk being released."
5,masterpiece,this album took more listens to get into then any other album iv brought but it was worth it as i now cant stop playing it. I hope tool never stop making albums.
3,Blot on the permanent record,"A few decent tracks || but just a few; and just decent. I can't help but think that this ""hidden message"" is going to turn out to be:APRIL FOOLS! THE REAL ALBUM WILL BE OUT DECEMBER 21 2012!"
2,What is the point of a 5 star rating system...,"...when everyone uses either 1 or 5 stars?Tool has become too self absorbed, not only with their 'new-age' spiritual nonsensebut their music as well. The fact that a good portion of Tools fans thought theleaked release was fake when it was infact the real album speaks volumes. However,it's not all bad, the first two tracks are quite good, but then a 30min snoarfest ofsome half-baked Floyd inspired barbituite of a song takes over. For the love of yourflying spaghetti monster, get back to basics!After listening to this album, I can only wonder..will the next Tool release be hardcover?For any aliens reading this... the next time you abduct one of Tools members, keep them!"
5,Tool is back!,"This album, like all of Tool's other offerings, takes several listenings to fully appreciate. Their last album, Lateralus, took quite a while to sink in, and while I can't say that one is on par with AEnima, it's definitely a fantastic piece of work. With 10,000 Days, however, I am totally suprised at how absolutely satisfying it is. This album is everything Tool is about -- plenty of heavy riffing mixed with psychedelia with brilliant song progressions. After listening to this one for a couple of weeks I can't get those tunes out of my head, which in my book is the ultimate compliment. If you are a Tool fan you should without a doubt love this one, and even if you're not, if you like Pink Floyd or Sabbath (or even the Butthole Surfers for that matter) or any type of music that is as much cerebral as it is on an emotional level, try it out. This is a good example of genius in songwriting, no question."
5,screw you.,"Tool is the best band in the world and we all know it.and i'm always right.if you do not like this album, your opinion is wrong.10,000 days [wings pt. 2] is one of the greatest songs ever made, brilliant sound and great vocals.Rosetta stoned IS one of the best songs in the history of all good things.5 stars for tool!!!1 :@ :@"
4,my second tool,"Having only listened to Aenima, I found the 10,000 Days CD to be much more cohesive and coherent. I have heard a lot of diehard Tool fans say they are really disappointed in this CD, but for me I will listen to 10,000 Days more often than Aenima."
4,A Great Tool CD,"I'm a Lateralus fan and it took me a while to really get into the songs on this CD. But I have to say that ""The Pot"" is my favorite Tool song now. This was a tough decision b/c I love Parabola and it's hard to quibble with that level of perfection. But like all Tool, the only criticism is that there just isn't enough of it.I struggled with giving this CD 5 stars, b/c Tool is clearly one of the best metal bands out there, but this CD just had too many spots where I had to skip tracks while they took their time playing soft artsy stuff. Don't get me wrong, love the art, just like the more head banging kind and when you're trying to work and listen to fast music, the soft stuff is a bit of an annoyance. For that I give it 4.5 Stars."
3,Danny Carey Worked On A Better Album Recently,I thought this Tool release was a mixed bag. Some decent songs along with more filler than even Aenima and even with all of the filler Aenima still managed to be one of the best Tool albums ever. Danny Carey did some drum work with Skinny Puppy on The Greater Wrong of the Right record. That record is better than this one. Go get that one instead.
3,Not Tool's Best But Still A Cut Above The Rest,"For such an innovative band this work was a bit of a dissapointment lyrically. Best recommnedation for a first listen would be their album Lateralus. Recommendations off this album are Vicarious, Rosetta Stoned, and The Pot."
2,Where's Maynard?,"A couple good songs but mostly a let down. The whole album pretty much sounds like one long song and Maynard has way to many effects on his vocals. He never really belts it out like he can. Overall very disappointed, mainly because I love Tool so much and this album didn't live up to my expectations."
3,"10,000 days, worth the money!(for the album cover, and art)","I have been a TOOL fan from the beginning, and I never thought I'd ever say this, but I think Maynard was confused! Maynard is the current heavy metal GOD in my eyes, but I think he may have forgotten that this was a TOOL cd, and not A.P.C.. Dont get me wrong A Perfect Circle is a great band, but its not TOOL!!!!! He didnt put the edge on his voice. The music is AWESOME, just Maynards anger, and hate that we all have grown to love and fear, wasn't brought out through his voice on this cd. I will always love TOOL, and anything that Maynard does, but I just wanted, and expected more from 10,000 Days. The art work on this cd is the best I have ever seen, and definitely worth the money. Any A.P.C. fans out there that have never heard TOOL before( come out of the rock you are living under!), this is the first album you should get, then try the rest of TOOL's unbelievable past. In Maynard We Trust!!!!!!!!666!!!!!!!!!"
2,tool..2 stars?..say it aint so.....,"even though i became bored with lateralus within a couple of months after it's release, i was pretty psyched to hear tool was coming out with this record.for me, lateralus & those 2 perfect circle records didn't even come close to satisfying my tool fix.for me, 10,000 days was even a bigger letdown than lateralus. i actually feel ripped off.thank god newer bands like disturbed,lamb of god and chevelle don't have any problem giving their fans what they want and still rocking the f out.i don't have time in my life for the big egos,self indulgent album releases, and over hyped media exposure of bands such as tool or radiohead or marilyn manson. ROCK THE F OUT or..GET THE F OUT!none of you have done anything cool since the 1990's...WAKE UP!!"
1,Don't wast your money,Ok I am going to do something I thought I would never do I am going to bash a tool album. This is by far the worst tool album ever. I have loved tool since there first album and I couldn't believe they made me wait 5 years for this garbage. Maynard is almost totally absent on the album and when he does sing it is weak and pathetic. I guess those years with a perfect circle just took every last bit of talent he had left. If this is the quality of music tool is going to make now they should just break up and save them selves the embarrestment. If I wanted a crappy perfect circle album I would have bought one. It is truly a sad day for those of us who actually thought tool would just keep saving the day.
2,"10,000 Tears","I have loved Tool since there first album. It seems to me that since the birth of A Perfect Circle, the aggressive and dynamic sound of Tool as slowly dwindled away. Of course, this is my opinion, since I like heavier music. Lateralus, to me, was a huge let down. Very long and boring, except for Schism, Ticks and Leeches, The Grudge. I read online that this album was going to be heavier than Lateralus. I was very excited when I heard this and looked forward to the new album. Sad to say, this album is anything but heavy. Don't get me wrong, I do like Vicarious and Jambi, but that's it. 2 songs on the whole album. Half of the album is soundscapes and instrumental. The other songs are long, slow, and boring. I wanted to like this album as much as anyone else, but I just can't. I guess all the qualities I loved about Tool in their first 3 albums are no more. Sad but true. Just my opinion."
5,Wicked Awesome Artwork,"Wow. That's the word that came to mind when I first went through the album cover. The artwork is amazing. Supposedly, there is a puzzle to be figured out in the photos. (This was said on Tool's official website.) I have yet to figure the puzzle out. If anyone gets it, let me know! Now, onto the actual reviewing: 10,000 Days is a great album, but I expected more. Call me crazy, but I figured this CD would out-do all its processors and it really didn't. There were some early sounding Tool songs like Vicarious and Jambi (the first two tracks) which were really great. My favorite songs were Wings For Marie, Pt. 1 and 10,000 Days (Wings, Pt. 2). The rest of the album, however, doesn't really stand out. Not that it's bad music, it's just different in that not each song is really memorable. But, hey, it's Tool! Anything by Tool is great and that's why I give it five stars."
1,Worst Tool Album Ever,"Guys,First off, I enjoy all of Tool's previous albums. Are you listening to the same album I am? If you guys actually listened to the music ""deeply"" you would realize that almost every song on this album is a recycled riff from one of their previous albums. And the lyrics are miserable too, save for 10,000 days/wings for marie combo. Ive also listened to the album over 15x to try to have something resonate here, and honestly I would not do that for any other band besides Tool because I know how their albums work.Therefore we have no artist progression, boring segues, and terrible lyrics. Listen to Maynard and think for yourself; this album stinks."
2,Biggest Tool disappointment,"This album in no way lives up to any of their previous albums. Not only are they recycling riffs from old songs, they are doing so in a totally monotinous way. There's nothing new and exciting for this veteran Tool fan here.This album simply bores me."
2,Has anyone seen my TOOL?,"I'll be brief and to the point...10,000 DAYS, has nothing I have grown to expect from TOOL!It sounds like he's throwing together thoughtless lyrics.It almost sounds like he's trying to sound hard but failing to do so...{SHALLOW} should be the title of the album.Or even (LACK OF INTEREST), or better yet....[GONE SOFT]...Where is the RAGE in his voice?Is Maynard happy now?I don't want him happy!I NEED him ANGRY!!I miss the feeling of TRUE soul pouring from his lips!Please bring back the sound and insight I've grown with!"
4,"Great Music, TERRIBLE LYRICS","I won't go on for too long, since so much has already been written. I'll say that, as usual, and especially since Lateralus, I find Tool's music to be sonically captivating. Guitar, drive, drumming, bass, vocals...all of it. What pains me is that Maynard can't come up with better lyrics. With a few exceptions, his lyrics have been atrocious on all Tool and A Perfect Circle projects. They're just embarrassing. Search lyrics for ""Vicarious,"" the first single off this album. They're like something a 7th grader would write. Lyrics for ""The Pot"" and ""Rosetta Stoned"" are almost as terrible.All that said, buy the album purely for its sound. Most of the tracks are mesmerizing and beautiful, though I could do without ""Lost Keys"" and ""Viginti Tres"" as well. The first is stupid and the latter a waste of sonic space.If Maynard and the boys could put together some decent lyrics and tighten up the next album a bit, they could be on their way to being rock gods for the ages."
3,10000 days,"I haven't heard the whole album yet, but I wanted to respond to Mr. Censored's complaint about the ""generic"" title. Per Rolling Stone magazine, the title refers to the time the singer's mother was on chemotherapy for cancer before she succumbed to the disease.""Generic"" title indeed.JR"
5,What's to question?,I don't know what the fuss is. This album is great straight out of the gate. No explanation needed. No qualification desired. Get on with it.
3,Highly self-derivative,"Displaying their trademark studio mastery and epic length, progressive metal's most successful act seemed to nonetheless be headed to a complete creative standstill with their latest release. Like a logical extension from Lateralus, itself an extension from what was perhaps their only true evolutionary leap (Aenima), 10,000 days continues to either channel the compositional phrasings of past glories or meander down more insignificant bloat in the name of ""experimentation"", though few bands as influential and once innovative display the lack of exploring outside their predefined parameters more prominently."
4,Tool does it again...,"It's everything I expected from Tool and more.No big surprises on this one, but that's not why we listen to them is it. There's plenty of energy, hard driving riffs and complex arrangements executed with precision the way only they can deliver. There are also plenty of what some call filler but are truely spiritual meditations. Try zoning out to them and see where the merkaba takes you. The real extra here is the packaging, stereoscopic images with it's own viewer built right in, amazing. I thank Tool for preserving the lost art of album design."
5,Simply amazing,"People who don't particularly enjoy this album seem to hate it because it is ""different"" from the previous albums from Tool. But then again, haven't each and every Tool album been significantly different from the last? I'm all for bands having the same sound they've had from day 1 of their careers, but Tool has changed for every album now, and they do it in such a way that keeps us entertained and wanting more. Every new album has quite a different sound, but unlike many bands who change over the years, Tool tantalizes us with bits of old fused with the energy and sound of the new and tackles our brains with yet another awe-inspiring masterpiece. From Vicarious to Viginti Tres this CD will amaze you."
3,Maynard brought A Perfect Circle back with him.,I love Tool and I love A Perfect Circle. But I haven't heard Tool since Lateralus. This album is good. It is not particularly long though. And it is decidedly NOT TOOL! This is A Perfect Circle. If you liked the side project then you will like this but if you have been waiting for Tool you will be disappointed as I was.
1,Disappointment to say the least,"Being the major Tool fan that I am, I was excited when I heard that this album was coming out. To my suprise, I was excited over nothing at all. I didn't think it was even possible for Tool to put out such a bad album. Words can't describe how terrible this album is. I wanted to like it, so I listened to the album at least 10 times around, it never grew on me. The people that give this album a good rating are blinded by what Tool has done in the past. Instramentals are extremely weak along with the vocals. Nothing flows, everything sounds forced. The first time I heard Vicarious I thought It sounded amazing, but each time after that it sounded worse and worse. It just is missing something (and this is by far the best song on the album). If an unknown band wrote this music, no one would ever sign them (local underground bands have better music). I havent' been this disappointed over an album since Metallica released Saint Anger."
2,Five years for this???!!,"I love tool, but after aenima they ran out of steam. Lateralus has it's moments and so does 10,000 days, but they're both disappointing, even more so on 10,000 days. How can they take 5 years to release an album that only has 5 or 6 ""actual"" songs on it!! Vicarious is a rehash of Schism, does Tool really think we're idiots? When Tool release their next album in 5 years, I think I'll just hang on to my money."
2,Very very disapointed,"Pros: When the songs started rockin they were as good as Tool has ever been. Heavy and caotic. It's what you expect from Tool. Very musical.Cons: %25 hard rock. %75 intro/sound effects. You know how Tool has some long intros before the song gets going? Some of the songs were just intros that never built to the song. Just tracks where the instruments played the same thing over and over with voices in the background. There was a stupid song that was just tribal voices that never turned into anything. Followed by a track of sound effects. You'd think that they could've wrote more than 6 or 7 actual songs in 5 years. track 10 came and I was thinking, ""Okay 2 more songs to change my epinion."" Track 10 was great. Track 11 was just dumb sound effects.Maybe someday they'll release a greatest hits cd with their best songs. Then you won't have to waste money on a cd that is half sound effects that they thought were cool. I want to hear music when I buy cds!"
1,What's all the fuss about?,"Tool are alleged to be one of the favorite band of Robert Fripp, founder of King Crimson, and I am a HUGE admirer of his. Unfortunately, after listening to this, all I can say is ""Huh?"" Some complicated time signatures, some odd chord progressions (and odd chords!) but BORING BEYOND BELIEF!I though I had to be missing something, ao I went back and listened to some of the rest of the catalog. ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS BORING. If the only thing about these guys that keeps you awake is the sound level, pick up a remaindered copy of Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music"".Not one of these songs could come close to Crimso, even at their most paisley."
1,so bad it made me mad,"First, I acknowledge that Tool is the best band in the world. That just makes this CD that much more disappointing.There are 2 half decent songs on this CD, the rest is annoying, nonsensical, repetitious, grating noise. This CD is almost entirely lacking any melodies. There's actually a ""song"" of indian chanting! I am at a loss to describe this CD any further. What a waste of time.Listening to this CD actually made me angry."
2,WTF,What I dont understand is why we keep buying this 3 to 4 song cd and the rest is sh** Nothing but noises to fill the CD!!And also you cant even hear the vocals. Dont get me wrong tool is a very creative band but come on!!!!
2,Come back to Earth Tool Zealots,"Come on Tool Zealots, this is Mediocre at best, just like Lateralus. What I hear on 10,000 Days, and Lateralus, is four musicians standing at the front of the stage, all doing solos at the same time and trying to one-up each other. The lyrics and Maynard's voice have become melodramatic. The only time they sound good on this latest album is in the song ""The Pot."" In this song Maynard does sound good with his new style, and the instrumentation is not meandering individually, each looking for the limelight. Otherwise, they are trying to be too sophisticated, too deep. In my opinion their best was undertow and Aenima; Aenima being one of the best albums of all time.In short, they have sacrificed their edge for melodrama"
2,Tool returns... to the exact same sound they left too...,"Well, this is a good album; however, this is a cookie cutter Tool CD. I like it that bands have a unique sound, and are affraid of venturing off in fear of being called a sellout (Everygreys new CD is a prime example of that, brilliant yet people call them sellouts.) This Album is nothing new, and didn't live up to what I expected from such brilliant musicains on a LONG hiatus. Very moderate Album all in all."
1,Why 1 star? because tool fans are rabid,listening to tool doesnt make you an intellectual. infact it makes you a pseudo intellectual goon.furthermore i just love seeing snotty kids walking around the malls with this album stuck on their faces. they look so damn stupid peering through the magnifying glasses.thankyou for your time.
5,Another great piece of ART,"Okay, Disharmonic Nightmare this album didnt make YOU any smarter, thats obvious. But for people that like to listen to actual art that comes from the heart, you will want to get this CD. Its not the same as Aenima or Lateralus, BUT it is nevertheless an outstanding album (why would you want more of the same anyway?). Listen to it like you dont have anything to compare it to. Take it for what it's worth, on it's own, and you will find out that it comes from a very deep and talented source. It makes me feel good just like ALL their other albums. Maybe we need better listening skills?"
2,Sheep - Sheep - Sheep - Sheep - Sheep - Sheep - Sheep - Sheep,"I think it's funny that Tool, straight out, records a poor album by their standards, & by todays standards, pretty average...Yet many people try to FORCE themselves to like it.Do you see all these reviews of people saying, ""let it grow on you""? It's not a question of growing... 10,000 Days simply isn't very good & they're really saying, ""Keep listening to it until you convince yourselves its great""You're such sheep, it's pathetic. Tool could literally record static for 1 hr 20 min & you sheep would talk about how deep & complex it is, & if there's any ""hidden meaning""You aren't smart. You're just annoying."
2,A couple good songs and a LOT of filler...,"After listening to Vicarious and The Pot, I was convinced this cd would be worth owning. Much to my disappointment, very few tracks on this cd were even bearable. I found myself wondering if Tool is attempting (and failing) to sound like Pink Floyd?? Vicarious is a great track followed by aimless rambling tracks that never seem to end soon enough. Time to stop experimenting with mellow and strange concepts and get back to rock! The Native American chant tunes haven't worked for others (like Creed) yet everyone feels they must try it. I will add two or three tracks to my MP3 collection and then use this one as a coaster..."
4,"The 1,825 Day Wait In Between Lateralus and 10,000 Days Is Over","10,000 Days, it seems like I've been waiting 10,000 Days for this album to come out. The album is good but, falls in many places. The album gives you a spacey feel, like Lateralus before it. There is WAY too much production on this album and some of the tracks are no good. The tracks ""Lost Keys"", ""Rosetta Stoned"", ""Lipan Conjuring"" and the final track don't live up the rest of the CD. Aside from all the negative things on the album, Tool does deliver 7 wonderful tracks of spacey, thoughtful music. The album really relaxes me and makes me think a lot about who I am and my role on this Earth. The two key tracks are the epic ""Wings For Marie"" and ""10,000 Days"". The tracks form one idea and they are indeed the best tracks on the album. The lyrics on the album are done very well, as expected of Tool. Overall, I very enjoyed most of the album but, it's not Tool's best work."
3,I was hoping for more,"As others have pointed out, this album has only 5-6 ""real songs"". Vicarious, Jambi, Wings 1+2, The Pot, Lost Keys + Rosetta Stoned, and Right in Two. Now, I loved Third Eye. I enjoy long Tool songs. But here, it's too much. So much is repetitious, with quiet vocals or no vocals at all. This album could have been far better, had Tool shortned Wings 1+2 and Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned by about five minutes each, cut the boring Intension by half, removed the pointless five minute Vigniti Tres, and put in two or three more actual songs.It's an interesting musical experience. Vicarious and Right in Two are amazing. Rosetta Stoned and The Pot are unique and cool. Wings is haunting and beautiful. Jambi is good. But really... couldn't they have cut 20-25 minutes of filler and given us a few more amazing songs? Showcased Maynard's vocals more? After five years, this feels sort of like an EP."
5,Another fine Tool album.,"I am so glad that these guys still don't suck. Everytime they come out with a new album, I get ready for the suckage to begin, and it never happens. I love this record, just as I love all Tool records. You will to."
2,5 years for this!?,"i think more thought was put into the 3-D glasses then the music.all kidding aside, i truly anticipated a chill-inducing masterpiece. i mean 5 years to write and rehearse? perhaps all the side projects are draining their efforts.i'd still say buy it, it's not that I'm saying it's god-awful; i just had the bar set higher for a band of their caliber."
2,it's got its good points,"I found this album to be incredibly weak to be a Tool album. I have to agree with the reviewer from Littleton, Co about it not being a very good Tool album. There are a few songs that are pretty good, but there's a lot of filler.I really don't know what everyone is sh_tting their pants over... it's pretty mediocre compared to everything else they've done."
3,Lost?,"I love tool...I really do. And there are some great tracks on this album...but.They have run out of ideas and made an album with alot of ""filler"" yes I know what you say...Music without lyrics is not filler.Its just that I expect more from a band in this calliber. Ive seen them live and own all their work. Comparing this album to typical rock radio I would give it 4 stars. Comparing this work when put along with their previous efforts I have to give it three. Cohesiveness lacks. The album seems lost at times. Hopefully I just need more time with it.I bought both the new PJ and Tool...I think I will go back to the new PJ."
2,Utter Disappointment,"What happened? Perhaps the most disappointing album to come out by one of my favorite bands in a long time. Imagine Tool's 'Lateralus.' Now imagine all the passion, instensity and general awesomeness completely stripped away from the album and you basically have the depressingly inadequate '10,000 Days.' The first four tracks are absolute masterpieces, featuring some of the best musicianship and arrangements ever done by Tool, in particular 'Wings for Marie Pts. 1&2.' Beyond these songs, however, the content is almost non-existent. Whether it be the short soundscapes of 'Lipan Conjuring' and 'Lost Keys' or the ridiculously awful 'Roseta Stoned', the latter half of the album completely flounders. Maybe next time Maynard..."
4,A good value for $10,"Its true there's not a lot new on this CD, and I thought it was a little boring when I first listened to it. But then I found it worth listening to about 100 more times. It has at least 7 good songs, and if you like Tool its definately worth buying. If you're a Tool hater of course you won't like it, but then I'm not sure what you're listening to that's better."
3,Lacking,"Musically and lyrically, this album is a step back for Tool. Whereas the songs on Lateralus unfolded like symphonic movements, with well thought out motifs pushing each piece toward its own well-earned, ecstatic climax, the songs of 10,000 Days have none of this ingenuity. Nor does the album have the sense of thematic, spiritual purpose Lateralus had. While a band does not need to repeat the glories of a past album, and while it is always unfair to compare old with new, I do think it is safe to say that Tool is not putting the same care and craft into this effort that it is capable of. A good album by any standard, just not Tool's."
4,From A Tool Fan,"TOOL is by far my favorite band and i would never question what they do but i think this album could have been heavier. Def doenst feel like they were listening to musshuga like they said they were. Too much quiet singing from MJK. Its def a headphones type of CD not a crusing down the street record. Vicarious, Jambi, and Rosetta Stoned, are the best tracks. Good album and obviously noe Aenemia but still TOOL through and through"
2,Tool USED to be one of my favorite bands,"After many listens to this album it seems to me they wrote about 20 minutes of songs, and the rest is just filler, and unlike Aenima where there would be a 5 minute slowly fading intro in to an awesome song (eulogy) in this album there is a 5 minute intro and then a bad song, or even no song at all. There are alot of tracks that aren't even songs, just indian chants or stupid stuff like that. The 3-4 songs that actually are songs on this album are good but the other 45 minutes is really poor. The 3D effects on the covers are really great though, maybe they thought they had to do something to sell this record, so well give it a fancy cover."
5,not there best work but deserves recognition,"I don't see what the fuss is all about for this album, to me I think its great. I'm not a huge tool fan but this sounds a lot like there older stuff and I don't see what the problem is with that. The only problem with this album is that it took 5 years, and again I don't see a problem with that either, Lateralus nearly took 5 years and its being hailed as TOOLS BEST ALBUM but that is just an understatement because I think this is Tools best work since AENIMA which was released 10 years ago. So if Tool needs to come out with an album every 5 years thats fine with me as long as they can pull it off and with this album I think they did so stop your bitchin and really listen to this cd, ya it does take time to listen to it but as other reviewers said, once you get into this album you will really like it. Personally, I think this album is better than Lateralus but thats just me."
2,The Jewel Case Has More Lasting Interest,"I really enjoyed the 3d jewel case. I really enjoyed the first track. Period.There were sparks of Tool past - but they were to few and to far inbetween - as in buried 5 mins into an 8 min long song that just about required a Red Bull to get there.They either need to do more, more often to get back into their music or stop and do more damage to the tremendous offerings from the past. A Perfect Circle should be example enough for M."
5,Find the sequence in the syllables,"You,All,though that,this would be,an Epiphany,sent by Tool for you all to see,the divinity,deep with in,our soul,Ha!Ha!"
2,A blank CD-R is worth more !,"Ive listened to the album several times and it bores the hell out of me. I like instrumentals, but this album really only has a handful of actual songs.... the rest of the album is pretentious, self-indulgent garbage. I cant believe all the positive reviews the tool slaves gave this album. Its been how many years since Tool released their last boring CD ? What is it; 6 years or so.And the packaging is a gimmick. Oooooh, its so trippy (sarcasm, DUH !). Give me a break. The CD ""case"" will no doubt show a lot of wear in a few years. Do they think about how the packaging will erode over time ? I guess not. They probably think the cool packaging will entice fans (sheep) to buy this; and they are probably right.Sorry folks, but the members of this band arent anywhere close to ""gods"" that you make them out to be. They are just simple men making music. To call them or any indiviual member a ""god"" is downright pathetic."
2,It is just not that good,"This album starts off great with Vicarious and Jambi, then pretty much goes downhill from there, until Right In Two. The rest is mediocre at best (The Pot, Rosetta Stoned), or just plain garbage (Wings for Marie, Lipan Conjuring, Lost Keys, Viginti Tres).For me, Tool has always shown a progression, or evolution to their music. And it has always made some kind of emotional statement to me, a connection. I personally and not finding either in this album.It really pains me to be writing this, as I wanted to give this 5 stars, as I would every other Tool album. Unfortunatly, this album does not merit it.That having been said, the packaging of this album is friggin incredible. The artwork is amazing, and alone is worth the money."
5,"ten thousand days, subtle genius","Most of tool's previous albums were much easier to enjoy. They kicked off excellent and immediatly entered your blood, and began flowing through your body. I'm saying this having only heard Aemina and Lateralus. They both had interesting beginings for the albums, as well as cool names. So, I wonder if Tool was in the studio and had an idea to make their fans believe they they had given up with their cool music. With a common sounding beginning, and a dull name. Then they did another thing, they changed their music to be a quiet, subtle, and probably the most emotional album they've made. The songs are certainly more emotional than their earlier songs like ""Hooker with a penis"". Hmm.Yeah, but this album is good. It probably would have done much better if it had been released in the Winter though."
4,Tidy by any means,"10,000 Days I think was surrounded by too high of expectations, and I'm very guilty of that myself. There was so much speculation going into it (decoy albums, fake song titles, a second release in late summer (?), hidden messages, etc.) and all of it was just so far fetched that people were without a doubt disappointed with the final product. But after you let go of what it ""should"" have been, and embrace it for what it is, you'll find this to be just as good as Aenima and Undertow. I don't think it surpasses Lateralus, or even Aenima, but its nestled right on the same line as Undertow and Opiate, in my opinion."
2,Not Impressed,"Ever since they made the metal/alternative classics ""Opiate"" and ""Undertow"" and seeing them on the sidestage at Lollapalooza III, I have bought each subsequent album hoping it would be another album with crunching quitars and heavy base riffs, but sadly Tool has slowly become just another progressive/tribal/psychadelic rock band. The anger and raw sound is gone,replaced by tribal druming and background noise. If you liked there last album, then you'll probably love this, but if your like me and are waiting for the next Undertow, don't bother, I don't think they have it in them anymore."
3,Overall Dissappointment,"I have to admit, there were probably a lot of us tool fans that were expecting an album to wow us like lateralus did. I know i was. Upon listening to this i actually bought into the rumors that were around calling this album a big hoax because of the overall lack of quality, especially considering the amount of time it took for the release. I think they are finally out of ideas. But who can blame them? I mean honestly if you look at all great rock bands in the seventies the quality of the releases goes down over long periods of time. So all in all i believe lateralus was the last great release from tool so we can appreciate that at least. there are at least 5 good songs on here, making it a good EP, so ill give it 3 stars for an attempt."
1,Just don't call it music.,"Optiate was a great thrashing simple guitar drums, bass, vocals EP, ""Undertow"" was them progressing there sound to another dimension, ""Aenima"" is an incredible piece of captured mixed and dark emotions, then came ""Lateralus"", kind of dissapointing, certainly not bad, but quite dissapointing considering how far this band had progressed, but they seemed to be taking a step down.And after another long wait we have the unimaginativley titeld ""10,000 days"", I tell you something, you can always tell what the music will sound like on an album from the artwork and album title, and unfortunatly, the music on this album is just thats. ""10,000 days"" to make, and 5 seconds to name the record.Another band falls down in the dust."
1,Go Back To '97,This album is not that great. I would have ranked it a bit higher but I am really disappointed by the songs on here. It was all very disheveled. They should go back to the earlier CD's and take a listen. That's what made them. This is all commercial and sellout.
1,Insert clever statement here,"This cd is bland, unimaginative, and possess portions that would only appeal to someone on so many drugs that they would occasionally forget how to breathe"
1,Awful.,"I'm not a big fan of Tool, but I know that Optiate, Undertow and Aenima are great albums, however Lateralus was a terribly boring album, incredubly dissapointing and predictable and lacking any real life.....this album though is a smashing disgrace, the songs sound like they are thrown together crap, not arrangments, no melody tune, structure let alone feeling or emtotion plain boring and dull. No wonder, just like Lateralus they needed to include overe the top eccentric artwork to compensate for the crap they are putting out under their name these days ""TOOL"" - the deep phyllosophical mysterious band that was been, a bunch of old 40 year olds trying to be worth it.Well they are not, back in 1997, they were the biggest thing since sliced bread, but they were actually good then. Which is why Aenima was one of the biggest selling album of the 90s.Any artist that includes goggles on their cd cover to look at artwork had to be faking it, I thought it was about the music anyway."
1,USeless pop rock.,"Just more overrated useless, talentless pop rock from Tool. Save your money, download it if you must but don't beleive the hype, this band sucks."
2,Haven't heard it yet but...,"I haven't heard this album yet, but it can't possibly be better than Tool's masterpiece ""Aenima."" Lateralus was just OK. They will never top Aenima. Never."
4,Grows on you,"I have had this album since it was released. When I first received it I listened to it about 10 times or so and was unimpressed. I filed it back into my CD collection and left untouched until about a month ago. Since then this album has steadily grown on me to the point that I thoroughly enjoy it now. Though not as good as Undertow or Aenima (the best tool album in my opinion) it is better than Lateralus.Like all Tool albums 10,000 Days will grow on you, for some of you it may take a while. But to the people who gave it 1-3 stars, you'll eventually be back on here upgrading your review. 10,000 Days is a good album, perhaps in another month I'll think it's a great album."
3,"Oh, and by the way...","Yes, this is tool's weakest album if you try listining to it by normal means, BUT!!!!!!!! there's the secret track of corse...You must combine the 3 songs: Viginti tres, Wings for Marie, & 10,00 Days altogether. I don't feel like explaining all the details on how to do it right, but if you google it (search: tool 10,000 days secret song or something) you'll find out how to do it on your own or you can download an mp3 like i did of the version. Trust me, once you have heard them altogether, the album will make alot more sence and it won't seem like filler crap.PS: I 'do' know that you need AUDACITY to edit the tracks and that you need to adjust Wings for marie to start right when Viginti Tres ends. listen to the song and see if all songs are in key, the first two are already in-synch, you just need to shift Wings for marie a bit"
5,Love it!,"Thank God Tool put out another album. I don't know whether to be upset that they take so long between releases or to be grateful that every new release is perfect and that they took the time to do it right. Before I got the album I was almost apprehensive to hear it, worrying it would be bad, but Tool never does the typical thing with their music, and once again, they hit the nail on the head. 10,000 Days is beautiful, more melodic than Lateralus but just as strong. I would highly recommend this to anyone, not just Tool fans."
3,Uninspired Tool,"While this album still maintains the melodies, rhythms and ambiance that makes Tool sound unique, nothing truly shines. As a whole 10,000 Days falls somewhat short of the mark established by earlier Tool.Two songs have enough musical substance and edge to get my mind moving: Vicarious and The Pot. The rest are auditory lulls that leave little to no impression on me. It simply seems that this album lacks some manner of creativity that can be found in their previous work.I have listened to this release many times now and although 10,000 Days fails to rile my enthusiasm for Tool, it is a passably satisfying musical experience.Having given the album time to sink into my consiousness, I would have to give it 4 stars. While I hold to my earlier comments, the music does have longevity and enough appeal to keep me listening from time to time."
2,It could have been good.,"I absolutely loved Lateralus and Aenema. What this album is missing that those ones had was DYNAMICS. Atmospheric, brooding sections would build into propelling grooves, and explode into these bombastic, ""in your face"" sections that would rock you sideways. You really got a sense of development in the songs.That's all here, but it's all been spoiled in the post-production. The entire thing is such a flat, boring sound. I'm listening to the first track, Vicarious, thinking, ""Man, this section could rock my face off."" The guitar is was too loud, the vocals are too soft. Somebody asks ""Where are Danny Carry's balls?"" If you listen really hard, his playing is just as great, you can just barely HEAR it! It could have been SO GOOD! I don't know who produced and/or mixed the album, but in an effort to go for a more ""mainstream"" sound in the production, they've spoiled all the peaks and valleys that make Tool such a good band. Whoever it was, shame on them!"
2,"Boring, Droning, Disappointing","If you feel this is a great effort by Tool, I'm jealous. I so wanted to love this album, as I have their past 3...Please attempt to review this CD here, and not the band. Anyone who bothers to post here probably loves Tool, as I do, however 10,000 DAYS has little progression in the songs, and is made up mostly droning riffs that go nowhere. None of the epic sound of past releases.Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the production; maynard's voice is way back in the muddy sound of the guitars, and never wails above when it should. And where are the great searing guitars(?), mainly boring unimaginative riffing.A few high points, but way too many boring minutes - all the ambient filler further makes me suspect of the effort. The silver lining? Tool will tour and we can hear the rest of their catalog...Lateralus was Tool's peak, with Aenima only slightly less brilliant. Now, sadly the curve has started downward... sharply."
4,I wish I could get a 30 second preview for each song.,"I am not a diehard Tool fan, but I am a little bit more than a casual fan. I own their AEnima album (I don't know how to do the A-E thingy.) and I think it is awesome. As for 10,000 Days, the only song I heard is Vicarious and I think it is awesome, too. I just wish there was a 30 second preview for each song (I know it doesn't sum up the song in a nutshell, but it gives a direction to where the song goes.) So for me, this album is not fully realized. I've seen some mixed reviews for this CD (lowest score was 2/10 highest was 10/10. Why am I not surprised?) My advice is if you're just getting into Tool, buy AEnima, as it is a crowning achievement in their music career. But, hell buy this album, too, because if its Tool, its awesome."
5,Tool does it again! Did you think they wouldn't?,"This is not Opiate, Undertow, Aenima, or Lateralus . . . but it is TOOL. Heavily influenced by everything else they've done to date, 10,000 Days is simply a masterpiece. The lyrical content is truly outstanding - MJK has really outdone himself. The mix is incredible - every instrument, even Maynard's voice, is even. So, the vocals are pushed a bit to the back, and the guitar and bass are strongly brought to the front. This IS the kind of CD that keeps growing on you - many fans will wish Amazon had a ""6 star"" rating so they can come back and update their review after a few more listens. The packaging is probably the coolest single CD I've ever seen. I don't mind if I have to wait another 5 years until the next Tool release. This one will tide me over just like Lateralus and Aenima did in the past."
4,Wonderful follow-up to Lateralus,"I sometimes wonder if Trent Reznor (Whom I have great respect for and really enjoy his work) feels like Salieri to Mozart when listening to Tool or Perfect Circle.I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I loved Lateralus, it still blows my mind at how refined, insightful, spiritual, and flat out enjoyable experience it was. 10,000 days seems to be in the continuation of this psuedo-spiritual era of Tool.If you are one of the Tool fan minority that did not like Lateralus, then 10,000 days will probably also no thrill you. However if you liked Lateralus I sincerely believe that you will enjoy 10,000 days.Though Lateralus is still a stronger experience in my opinion, 10,000 days is yet another example of Maynard James Keenan being one of the great living musicians."
2,"10,000 Days = average song length on the album","One great single, one or two relatively catchy songs that are still too long, and a whole lot of boring tracks that go nowhere. While it's not straight up bad or painful to listen to, it's definitely their worst album and sadly, it's pretty uninteresting. Frankly, in many spots it sounds more like A Perfect Circle than Tool. And all the recycled tricks, the pick scrapes, the echoey screams, the talk box... just tired. Still a great band, still great live, just not a fantastic album. Of course, most Tool fans are so diehard it will take them at least ten years to realize this but hey, whatever floats your toolboat."
1,What happen to tool ?,"I remenber when tool had songs that made you think or were realy impressive but damn this new release is realy bad. At first when i started listining, i had that let down feeling all over me and coulnd belive this is the same band that release undertow , opiate , aenima . I bought this not even havent heard one track, like a movie not even watching a preview and wanted to be surprise. I thought i was going to impressed. What happen to tool ? Ever since lateralus they began sucking and now this ? Rock is dead so il stick to my old records. laters, do skip this junk"
4,Its a Shame...,"That nobody can even keep up with this band. They are just that good. Every song on this album rules, but I gave it 4 stars because theres not that many. Theres way to much wasted space. For this long a wait, they should've put at least 7 or 8 tracks. There should be 0 Tool Cd's that you do not own! I got tix to Staples Ctr in 2 hours. ;)"
2,What Happened To Tool?,"First off, I've loved the music that tool has done in the past, but I find this CD a dissapointment. I've listed to it about 2 weeks to see if my opinion would change. But sadly it has not.This cd just seems to suffer from too much filler. Lyrics that are not very well thought out and dont flow well with the music. Lyrics that seem mumbled, slured, difficult or impossible to understand. Even the music seems to suffer a mumbleing and sluring of sorts. There dosnt seem to be one song that escapes this effect.The music and lyrics go though sections of good then bad and back agian. There are some very good sections of the CD. But overall its like there was just a lack of effort or that the CD was rushed. It could have been a very good CD, but it just misses the mark.I expected better. mabey thats the problem."
2,Not Tool's Best Work....,I waited a long time for Tool to release something new and I was quite dissapointed with this album. There are no songs on it that I found even mildly entertaining. I'm glad I didn't spend too much money on it. It wasn't even worth a second listen to. Despite being downright boring as far as the lyrics and the guitar riffs it seemed like every song on this album was a rehash of the first song on the album. Pass on this unless you just want to support the band.
1,"10,000 days, first album i ever deleted","I would say read the other 1 star reviews, i echo most if not all of them. As my title says, 10,000 days is the first album i deleted from my mp3 players...seriously. I am a fan of the band, but i don't follow blindly.10k days is painfully drawn out, some amateurish tweaking of songs from previous albums, filler, etc. I listened to this album numerous times trying to see if i missed something, just something to make me snap out of this apparent trance that i was in...it didn't happen, this album really is this bad. Of course no band can continuously pump out epic albums, especially trying to follow up Lateralus. But come on, imagine seeing this album live...no thanks.Suffice to say i would not buy a future TOOL album, as i'm a consumer and felt ripped off. TOOL, thanks for letting me down."
2,Really Dissapointed,"Yeah, it really doesn't compare to their other albums. The song structures seem haphazard--they're trying too hard to combine all of their styles together. Also, I thought the electronics were really subpar, as the ""tabla"" was clearly just made of poorly processsed samples. I expected more, especially after Lateralus. Probably their worst album."
3,"10,000 Days: Too little, too late","The new album, 10,000 Days, is exactly what has become the new standard for a Tool album. Flashes of pure brillance and energy in a few tracks, and a whole bunch of ""noodling"" and lost musical interludes. I'm trying real hard to like it. If you are a dedicated Tool fan, I guess you need this in your collection (like me) but what happened to the energy-filled CD's jam-packed full of rockin tracks like Opiate, Undertow, and Aenima? In this fan's opinion, the past two Tool albumshave been highly-indulgent."
2,Is Tool turning into Metallica?,"I am saying this cause Metallica's last album was an embarassment. I am a big Tool fan and I have to say this album is subpar,I love the lyrics and jamming power riffs from the past albums but it seems like alot of the tracks on this album are missing this. On alot of the tracks, it seems to me that the lyrics are drowned out by the instrumental.You might think that is good since we are talking about Tool, but the instrumental is weak. I swear some of the tracks would sound great in an elevator. The best song of this cd is Vicarious which sounds like a fill-in song on one of their past CD's. It is worth the price of a CD to get this but in the future it wont be a CD you will want to pull out and jam to like the previous masterpieces."
2,A poor effort,"From a musical standpoint, I guess you could say this is a highly technical album. However, I tend to think most musicians lean away from unusual time signatures and their constant changes because it sounds like crap.As always, Carey is spectacular on percussion (the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars). The rest of the bands work seems forced and unmotivated (yes, I know Maynard's mom died and all, my condolences, this cd is still terrible), as if their label simply pushed them to release another cash cow. I bought this cd expecting Tool - how disappointed I was. I've listened to it in it's entirity without interruption. I still don't like it. And I'm certainly not going to force myself to listen to this over and over again to appreciate it, my time is too important. I'll just write this off as a loss of $[...] and listen to Lateralus or earlier works when I'm feeling like Tool."
2,What happened?,"I think this disc is absolutely terrible. It nearly bored me to tears, and not because too much time was spent on ""soundscaping"" and all of that. I love ambient music and post-rock and 20 minute songs. The problem with ""10000 Days"" is that the band sounds uninspired and completely disassociated from their own music. Maynard especially seems to phone in his performance. Buy ""Aenima"" instead and don't let Tool think they can get away with taking 5 years for tedious garbage like this."
3,Mediocre by Tool Standards,"Tool is one of the most musically progressive and talented group of individuals out there. BUT they have not had practice working as a creative unit and it shows badly on this album. Rather than feeling like the masterpiece it should be, after a five year haitus, 10,000 Days feels more like a collection of Lateralus b-sides. The Tool formula has altered little from their previous album. This grieves me because each release since Opiate has had massive progressions in their sound, accept this one.The only reason the album recieves more than two stars is the fact that Maynard has become somewhat more personal in his lyrical aproach, proof that his stint with A Perfect Circle has at least given him time to grow as a writer, even if his vocal expression tends to stay somewhat static throughout this album.I wish I could say more, but I'm dissapointed."
3,Impressive...,"Impressive packaging as always, though this time around the music does seem to be less inspired, its much more ambient prone that previous releases and some of the songs are actual snoozefests, pretty boring that is. overall I expected more from a band as involved as Tool. (supposedly there is a whole back story meaning to the 10000 days topic which is related to Maynard's mother somehow.)"
4,Intension,The way you're going to feel about the album is the way they feel about the world and the certain situations that have inspired them to create this release.
3,You People Are Sheep - Plain And Simple,"There is one great song off this album, '10,000 days'.. That's it. The rest of the album is mediocre, that's it.Tool could release a cd of them going to the bathroom & you sheep would give it 5 stars.Lateralus & Aenima were both excellent.. This is just pointless, the music DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE.. It barely evokes emotion or thought.Tool aren't genius, not everything they touch is gold, quit trying to convince each other otherwise."
3,Disappointed,"My opinion:The music is good, but not as good as I expected from Tool. The lyrics are not bad. I think the band (excluding Maynard) did a good job musically, but Keenan's vocals make this sound like an APC album. It is very disappointing to see him bring the APC sound to Tool.This cd could have come out two years ago. I don't feel as thoroughly impressed with this album as I did with AEnima and/or Lateralus.Great to own, listen to, and put on the shelf. Keep Lateralus and Aenima in your CD changer."
5,Greatest Tool Album,"Been a fan since I heard Sober in 1993. Wow, I cannot say enough about how much I love this album. It is truly a work of art that unveils itself after numerous listens. This is truly a worthy follow-up to Aenima. Lateralus was great, but not quite up to usual Tool standards. This, however, is fantastic. The first five tracks are tool at their finest. Tracks 6-10 are more challenging but once they sink in it is extremely powerful. I am addicted to this CD...Absolutely brilliant."
5,Love 90% of it,Vicarious might be my favorite Tool song of all times.There's two songs on this that I don't love. The rest I found to be amazing.
2,Put me to bed,"Disappointing. As a longtime Tool fan I never thought I would say it but this album is a sleeper. It is an example of what happens when you devote half of yourself to a project. The album has a complete lack of momentum and energy. It is more of a funeral procession (which may be their intent judging by the lyrics). Even when the band gets energetic it merely sounds busy not intense. There is a total lack of swing and movement to the riffs, which is something Tool's prior album have been exemplary at doing. I know the band makes music for themselves, not to please the critics or the fans. However, I believe putting the Tool name on this album is misleading to those looking for a Tool album."
5,Best Tool Album,"After listening for a week, I must say, this is my favorite tool album. Everytime I hear a song it feels like the first time in a way..."
5,brilliant masterpiece,"This album should be viewed as a whole piece of art. It's not the radio friendly single album that the mindless public will love. It takes many listens, but then starts to grow on you. It is much like Dark side of the Moon, for a new generation. Each track flows so well into each other that time seems to stand still while listening. It is a must buy and must listen."
