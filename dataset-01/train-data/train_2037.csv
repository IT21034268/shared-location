5,so glad to find it again,"i got this album when I lived in New Orleans over twenty years ago. it was a cassette and was lost. its the best happy upbeat dance music around, and some in French which makes it fun. its also the best backround music for a frisky party you will ever find. it will get you tapping your toes or moving your body. I am so happy I can get another copy."
5,They stand the test of time...,"Well this was my favourite album about 20 years ago...I was in a drugstore and they had this cassette in the $1.00 binI bought it fast as I remembered what a fantastic album ""new Clear Days"" was,. And I was so surprised...Wow!what a masterpiece!one that nobody I knew had ever heard before.It quickly became my favourite album.Johnny was in LOVE again!Well here I am again 20 years later paid $15.00 or whatever to get it back again....Wow!Johnny is in LOVE again!It's my favourite album all over again.I have no words to explain how much pleasure it has brought me to finally get this album back. I have blown away my friends (different ones and the same old ones) with this album which again none of them have heard...The lyrics are so intense. The new wave sound never sounded better than this! they are the cars times 5!I can't talk anymore!"
4,Not as great as New Clear Days but not a career ender!,"What a shame the Vapors never made a third album. Magnets is a disappointment if you heard it after New Clear Days but it's got some great songs. Maddeningly, ""Civic Hall"" was left off the first compilation. It ranks up there with the best stuff on the first album."
4,Good for Cub Scouts,I bought a bunch of these to use with my Bear Den (3rd graders) to introduce them to birdwatching. I thought it was a really good tool to use with them for the price and they really liked the sticker aspect to it.
3,Out of Date,"Just from reading this page, I can tell that this book needs updating. ""Common Flicker"" and ""Northern Oriole"" are obsolete names. Also, most of the birds are eastern, and many are unlikely to be seen in the west. Love the concept, however!"
3,sticker birdbook,This may be difficult for young kids to get the stickers off and then keep the unused stickers in a protected place.I'm going to supervise them.
3,Volume 2... Not as good as the first,"As a person who is always cautious about collecting comic strips, these were incredibly easy to get into and follow. I bought all 3 after previewing them. These are simple, straightforward crime stories written by the masterful MAX ALLAN COLLINS. These were comics written in the late 1970's and early 80's and mark Collins' wonderful introduction to the Dick Tracy strip. Previous to this, Tracy was stuck in a campy Sci-Fi world. Once the strip's creator, Chester Gould, left the strip, Collins took over and brought the story back to its roots (fun crime fiction). There are 4 stories here... Not as good as the first, but still very entertaining! Get the first volume before you read this. It may also help to track down some of Gould's original strips or watch the 1990 Dick Tracy movie.Buy if you like Tracy and his world of crazy villains. You won't be disappointed."
2,Enjoy it while you can...,"I bought one of these a couple years ago. The style and size were just what I was looking for, and the picture was fine, but it lasted only a couple of months before it stopped working. I turned it on one day and smelled the distinctive ""electrical burning"" smell, and the unit was fried. I got what I paid for, but hoped it would last longer than that."
2,Great while it lasted,"this small color TV was fine for less than a year. It has a great picture, even though tuning in to local channels was tricky. Within the first year the sound started to go, but I found if I turned the TV off and on quickly, the sound returned. I don't expect it to continue working at this rate. You get what you pay for!"
1,Dead out of the box,"I bought this tv because I needed a color monitor for a security camera, and it had RCA audio/video IN jacks.Out of the box there was no picture at all, only sound. I returned it and did not opt for a replacement."
5,Big things come in small packages,"I boought this yesterday, its great. It uses batteries to make it portable or you can plug it in. You can even hook up a video game consolec up to this little thing. It's in color and has a great picture. I highly reccomend buying it."
5,"Terrific, suspense, dark film",This was a really good movie. It was well acted and well paced. Michael Vartan was terrific. This is the second movie I've seen him in - he was terrific in Never Been Kissed. Worth your while to see.
4,"bitter americans don't ""get it""!","I liked the film and was surprised to read some of these bad reveiws which seemed like thinly veiled resentful ex-producers lashing out. Having seen the film on the big screen in England it surprises me to here people in the US refer to the film as some Cable cash in on ""Scream"". It was at Sundance BEFORE Dead Man on Campus, Idle Hands, etc. In the UK this film was seen as a clever take on ""good-looking selfish American killers"". No, I don't like these people but, isn't that the point? And be honest, you might have predicted that there would be ""A"" twist but not the twists that happened. I saw the film again on video and really enjoyed watching it knowing the outcome. P.S. Pick up the soundtrack, the Goth/Herrmann hybrid is very Cool indeed!"
4,"A bit overdone, but a good rental!","The ending is sure a surprise, but a bit predictable.. Matthew Lillard is great in his role of another psychotic person (not hard for him to do) the only weekness is that it has a very lousy script... and the plot is stolen from ""Dead Man on Campus"" this is still a good thriller, though... just leave your brain at the door when you see this."
2,A good cast but....,It really is a bad movie. The plot is ok but the acting is bad. I don't think people would be interested in watching a bunch of college kids try to kill each other by pushing them over a cliff! I am glad I just rented it and not bought it!! I really like Keri Russell....she was pretty good in this movie.
2,"Waste of talent, bi-polar writing","Waste of an extremely talented cast. Kerri Russell is beautiful, Michael Vartan has depth, but neither of these fine actors are given the opportunity to show their wares. The director tries some slick camera moves with disastrous results. He has a poor eye and lousy voice for story telling. There script was apparently touched up by someone other than the director. There are moments of real depth, but the majority of the film is less than lackluster, trite, simply mean-spirited with no redemptive flaws or vulnerabilities. The sound track was over produced, souless, and the composer track is uninspiring. This director needs to be directed."
3,Brilliant performances -- lack luster directing.,Keep the cast... make a sequel. What happens to the survivors? Lose the director. Get someone who can tell a story.
2,"Great cast, poor directing -- THUMBS WAY DOWN.","Kill your dorm mate, get an ""A"". Intriguing idea, maybe the that's what the kids at Columbine had in mind. It's this simplistic, mean-spirited, and irresponsible film-making. Not one single character had a redeeming quality to them. Just left me feeling empty."
1,One of the worst,"It is easy for me to say that this is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. Totally ridiculous. The plot twists are just stupid and make no sense. The acting is terrible. I watched this movie with a lady friend. We were plenty ready to get a little frisky, but this movie put us to sleep. I can never forgive it for that. It was one of the five worst I've ever seen. DON'T BUY IT!"
4,"Suspense make this a better 'Curve""","Fascinating storyline tie-in with college myth that if your roommate dies you get a 4.0 for the semester. Movie had that ""Scream"" suspense in it. Matthew Lillard and Keri Russell are dynamite, and so is Michael Vartan. Must-see for horror-suspense fans! With a budget of $1 million, it was worth it and to see a sequel would be wonderful, but let's not go that far."
3,Excellent 1940 out of print collectable that still works,"W. Vickery's book is a classic in the Gunsmith trade. Long held as the bible in gunsmithing, it has since been replace by many modern texts. Yet, for the home machinist or basic gunsmith, it still teaches the essentials. Twenty chapters, all focusing on a different aspect of the trade.Filled with lithographs, photographs and illustrations, this book is a small work of art sitting on many a gunsmith's bookcase and work bench.Hard to find and worth the history it contains."
5,GREAT STUFF!!!,"Great cards! we are doing them when we go to bed at night. 10 minutes of ""playing"" - and we know a lot of interesting things!!!!My son refuses to fall asleep if I don't have time to ""play"" the cards - so, no choice....I highly recommend this product."
5,Brain Quest cards,We love the Brain Quest card sets. We have several sets for our 5 and 3 yr-olds. Their size and the fact that the cards are secured together make them perfect for slipping in a purse or backpack. They have proven invaluable when waiting in restaurants. The only problem we've had is getting the kids to stop playing when the food comes. We've also played so much that they have several of the sets memorized so it would be nice to have more sets within each age group.
4,"Daughter loves them, but well before Kindergarten","My daughter loves Ryan the Lion and would spend hours on brainquests, but at 3 she could easily answer 90% of these questions."
3,Too Easy for suggested age group.,Good questions to help my son prepare for Gifted Kindergarten program however I feel that the questions are too easy for 5-8 year old children. My son is 4 years old and found these questions easy.
5,Perfect age appropriate fun activity.,"This is our third Brain Quest purchase and the family loves all of them. Age appropriate so that the child can answer most of the questions but not all so there is some learning involved. Sometimes even Mom and Dad learn something new. Fun family activity for airplane trips, in the car or a great alternative at bedtime instead of books."
4,"Very Helpful, Not over the top","I would like my 4 year old to go through the testing process for independent schools or a Gifted & Talented program, but I am not willing to turn him off to learning or turn myself off to the process by hireing expensive tutors or feeling as if I am constantly grilling him. Brain Quest is a casual, fun way to expose a pre-schooler to the types of questions that he may be asked during the tesing process. Although my son is 4 (and 8 months to be exact), I took the advice of a previous reviewer and ordered the Kindergarten age range and I'm glad that I did... it is a perfect fit. Most of the questions are familiar, but challenging enough that he has to think about some of the things he already knows in a different way. There are also enough questions that he doesn't know, which makes me feel that he is learning something new. I am very pleased with this product."
3,oh Boy!,this player is pretty good for the price! but it wont tell you what song you are listening to! (no id3 tag!go get memorexes cdmp3 player in stead!
2,Missing Description,"Setting: American WestDangerous TerrainFaye Poincare was city-bred. Army scout Joe Harrison was a tracker. She despised his easy superiority. He didn't trust her.They came from different worlds, but contempt wasn't all they felt toward each other. For she was an alluring beauty, and he was as handsome as sin.In an untamed land they surrendered to an undeniable passion and discovered rapture in their heated embraces. Yet the fragile bond was threatened by hardship and mistrust till they faced the truth and learned that love was the only path to follow .. ."
1,hAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA,"1. The guy Joe Harrison is a stupid, sexist, weirdo who thinks he's tough and all. But his sexist ways didn't outrage me, I was too busy laighing at the idiot. He kept on calling that girl Faye ""Woman"". A savage indeed. But the true irony is he is very pro-government! I mean, you would expect a person who lives in the wild, wild west who would be rebellious but he is absolutely captivated by what be calls an ""orderly government"".2. The girl Faye is ANNOYING! She's always saying ""Oui"" to show off her Frenchness but gosh can't she just say ""yes"". She pisses me off because she does the I-resist-Joe attitude while she is VERY sexually attracted to him: Weird."
5,Best Book Ever,The Autobiography of Malcolm X is by far the best book I have ever read. It has changed my life. Buy it.
5,The ESSENTIAL Brother Beyond,"Brother Beyond and their ""Northern Soul"" sound are well represented on this collection. Their two biggest selling hits, ""The Harder I Try"" and ""He Ain't No Competition"" are presented in both their single and extended versions. It was nice to hear Stock/Aitken/Waterman expand their sound from their standard formula. The two songs show that they were about slick pop and not just cowbells and handclaps.Their other hits, ""Be My Twin"", ""Drive On"", ""When Will I See You Again"" (The old Three Degrees chestnut) and ""The Girl I Used to Know"" (their one US hit), are wonderfully remastered here.This was a great addition to my collection."
1,some of the worst Stock Aitken Waterman stuff ever...,"as a big fan of the SAW hi-nrg stuff, research led me to their writing and production for Brother Beyond. I was excited to find that those few songs were included on this inexpensive collection, along with the 12"" versions! Unfortunately, The Harder I Try and He Ain't no Competition are straightforward boy band pop tracks of the late 80s, with none of that trademark SAW sound. So, if Stock Aitken Waterman is your reason for considering this compilation, don't bother."
3,Nice tie,"there is nothing wrong with the quality of the tie, it's lovely,although the colour is slightly weaker than what it looks online."
2,You get what you pay for......,"I purchased this pan to replace one that doesn't sit flat on my girlfriend's glass topped stove. Much to my dismay, the bottom on this pan was not flat either. It would be good on a gas stove, I suppose. The body of the pan is made of fairly thin steel, with a heavier bottom attached. I returned it. Save up your money and invest in a higher quality pan. Another example of substandard Chinese goods."
5,Way better than a teflon pan,I love this stainless steel fry pan. I was getting concerned about the teflon flaking off my old fry pan. It is hanging as a shinning display on my kitchen wall between uses.
5,A perfect world,"This dvd takes you into a kind of ideal world, an earthly paradise. St. Petersburg is sublimely beautiful. The indoor settings are sublimely beautiful. The music is sublimely beautiful. Renee and Dmitri are sublimely beautiful. Their performances are sublimely beautiful. Even their clothes are sublimely beautiful. Moment after moment leaves you breathless. Yes, in an absolutely perfect world, Dmitri would have led the tour, not Renee. And the ""bonus"" materials would have been integrated into the main body, not set aside where they may be overlooked, Well don't overlook them. Especially, don't overlook Renee's Casta Diva. If there is one moment in this tour of the sublime that is most sublime, that is it. She seems to have astonished herself."
5,excellent,Renee Fleming is as good as ever and she always amazes me with her ease of singing and fantastic voice control. Dmitri Dvorosovsky sounds good but seems to be pushing a bit now and then. The duets are very enjoyable.The tour of the palaces is very interesting. Well worth buying.
4,Wonderful DVD,Loved the singing and the videos of places in St Petersburg. On my DVD player I couldn't get the English subtitiles to display. Don't know if it's my set up or the DVD.
2,celtic agate necklace,was prettier on the site. It looks a little cheap and I got the matching bracelet and earrings. The earrings fell apart several times and i do not wear the set anymore
1,at any price this toy is not worth it,"this toy is a complete waste of money, from the first time my son opened the box nothing worked, the pieces would not fit together, and just the overall rating of this product was very poor."
1,The new PLAYGIRL,The paper is cheap. The photos are grainy. This is not the PLAYGIRL we used to sneak a peak at.
3,Warm but not as cuddly or colorful as it looked on website,"Color is burned red (not ""red""). Texture is stiff and not as soft as other Columbia fleece purchases in past."
5,Terrific,My son wears it almost everyday even if there is a slight nip in the air. He loves it.It is true to size and amazing
5,comfort for a picky kid,"My son, who is very picky, loves this fleece jacket. It is a lightweight fleece designed for above freezing, but cool temperatures. It fits him well and the color is nice. I would not say the quality is top notch because of the detail finishings (no lining,stitching OK), but it is a great value with an mid quality feel. The fleece itself is just as good as any high end fleece product."
4,Solution for the little boy that won't wear a coat,"Finally a jacket warm enough that I'm happy and light enough that he will actually wear it. If you have a ""hot blooded"" kid like me then you'll want to buy this fleece jacket. It provides a barrier to the cool morning air in the fall and allows him the freedom to move around on the playground during recess. It's the first jacket that he actually wears without a fuss. It's light, warm, and stylish."
2,Very poor quality,"This jacket was not at all what I would have expected from Columbia. I normally love their products and was super excited to get this jacket on sale for our daughter. I took other reviewers' advice and bought her a size larger than I thought she would need. It fit perfectly, was warm, cozy, and she loved it. Unfortunately the stitching was coming apart in several places, so much so at the collar that the stiff filler at the edge was showing through. It was not something I could repair as it looked like the fabric was short right there and just wouldn't cover. I knew it wouldn't hold up so I decided to send it back. Amazon made the return easy for me but there wasn't a replacement available so I had to take the refund."
4,Great little fleece,The 3T for my 50%-ile 2-yr old fits just right for a full year of wear. Very cozy and stylish.
2,"Good product, but size does not match","Although I bought a 18 month jacket, the sizeing does not match. It would only fit a 6-9 months baby. I'm very disappointed to waste money on this product, since my son won't be able to use it."
3,Cute but runs very small.,"I like the item in theory, but I have to give it only 3 stars because the sizing is so off. My son is a very average size and quite lean, and when this 18 month jacket arrived around his 16th month, it was already more or less too small. Way too short, too tight to have anything but a long-sleeved t-shirt underneath. He's still wearing many of his 12 month things, so I think this is an issue with their sizing. We are very disappointed.I would use the age bracket as the MAXIMUM age it would fit a child and not the average or minimum. Definitely go up at least a size if you'd like to use it any longer than a week or two!"
1,Runs Small,"This fleece runs so small. Extremely disappointed. My son wears 12 months and this 18 month fleece was too small when it arrived. Besides the size, the fleece is quality and exactly what you would expect from Columbia!"
4,"Cute, lightweight, warm, but runs small","I purchased this jacket for my 4.5 year old, who typically is a bit on the smaller side, size-wise, for his age. It's cute, it's not bulky, it seems to keep him warm, but I was disappointed with the sizing. I got his typical 4T, which in jackets especially, would normally last him another year, but when I pulled this out of the package, I could tell immediately that he wouldn't be wearing it for long before passing it down to his 2-year-old brother. It really wasn't any bigger than his old 3T jacket. So my advice, definitely buy this jacket, but go at least one size up."
3,bit small,Its little bit small for my 36 month boy.Except that its warm and nice~I m planning to buy a bigger one for the next yr.
4,Short sleeves,"I bought one for my 12 year old and 5 year old boys. I would go up a size because the sleeves are too short on both. They normally wear sizes of there age, but not in these jacket. I will reorder one size up, but other then that they are good jackets."
1,Icky fleece material!,"I am an outdoors person with plenty of Columbia gear...this fleece is not up to par. It is such cheap material that it kind of squeaks when you touch it. Not even worth making a stuffed animal out of this. When kids are out in the cold they need something that is not just a pretty color--why should their ""performance materials"" not be the same as for adults? I would never put my child in this. Also, the color is more easter-eggy than in photo...I'd hoped it was a unisex color but I would never put this on my boy (and I have a pretty wide view of what ""unisex"" is). YUK all around."
3,Too short for sizing,My son is between 3T & 4T. I purchased this in a 4T. He is average size. I read a few other reviews about buying the size up so figured I'd be OK. I think this is about an inch too short. Fits pretty snug everywhere else. No extra arm length to grow. Hopefully we don't outgrow it before the winter season is over.
2,Diappointed,"This jacket is not up to par with quality I am used to from Columbia. My son had a similar fleece last year that was great. This jacket just wasn't what I expected. It's also very small. I ordered the 4T and it just comes to his belly button. Normally 4Ts are a little big on him. Even he said, ""This doesn't fit mommy"". I will either be returning it or giving it to a smaller child as a gift."
3,Fleece review,Very nice and warm but runs very small. My son is 2 years 10 months old and usually wears 2t or 3t and I got 4t and it fits him snug. I'll only be able to use it this season.
5,Delicate and Beautiful!,Just received the earrings yesterday. These are for a xmas present and they are beautiful for the price and size. I am going to buy me a pair in gold. Stunning also..
3,Not even close to cream or ivory colored,"I ordered this time for my groom in our chocolate/ivory themed wedding. This tie is not cream or ivory and it is not close to the color that is in picture of it. It is more of a taupe. It's a nice tie, but not a color that will work if you are looking for a true ivory and/or cream colored tie."
3,Le Creuset casserole,Love my Le Creuset cookware I have ten cast iorn pieces. Was a little disappointed with this one though. First it was shown with the usual black handle on the lid but came in silver so it doesn't match the others. Secondly it does not have an enamaled interior. Could have saved a lot of money and bought the same from Lodge.
3,Flimsy for the price,"Purchased. Came ready to put together. Cheap Pine and not easy to hang. I had to make an alternative means of hanging it from scratch. For the price, I would expect a little sturdier wood to be used. Nice finish, looks like dark cherry."
4,Outstanding & Original,Great album. Well worth every dollar. Not just for Elvis fans. For everyone who knows most of these songs from their original artists. Superb background artists playing on the instruments as well. Elvis himself could not have done it better.
1,"Elvis Presley ""UNIQUE"", ""GENUINE"", ""NOT ARTIFICIAL""","Who ever thinks anyone could do better then Elvis has no idea about Elvis...he is the KING, and there is only one king. So all of you impersonators....find your own identity and let the KING rest in peace. Thank You....and good night...Elvis has left the building."
3,Decent,I use the radio during the day mostly for AM sports talk. I get decent reception outside and horrible static when I'm inside. The tuning dial is hyper sensitive and will move slightly if you keep it in your pocket causing annoying station bleeding. I'm currently looking for something with a digital tuner.
4,Works fine,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas for her morning walks (she's not into IPods or MP3s) and this little thing works great. It's not expensive at all, and you can tell by it's light weight and how it's built, but for what $8? it gets local stations just fine. A little positional interfereance as with many FM types, but fine."
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this to use at the gym while working out. Reception is really crappy. Couldn't get any of the 6 channels offered at my gym to hear the tv. Could only get 1 or 2 radio stations - small ones not the popular ones. Even though it's cheap, it's not worth it."
2,mine didn't have very strong reception,Don't really use at all because reception is so spotty/bad... bought an ipod nano and was going to use as cheap radio at gym... also would buy a digital tuner... with manual difficult to get right on station (and so have a chance of clear reception)... who knows if may be ok for some people in some areas for some purposes... (this is only reason gave 2 stars-1 and 1/2 may be better- instead of 1... a couple or few stations come in alright... just not all of them. would spend a little more money to get digital tuner (with pre-set stations) that all or most reviewers agree gets pretty good to good reception. A live and learn mistake for me to buy...
2,Poor reception,"I generally wanted this for use while jogging. I really only planned on listening to a major nationwide AM program (Broadcast on WLS in Chicago, probably the most powerful AM station in the area), but no matter what I do the station gets bleed over from another AM channel that isn't nearly as powerful or close as WLS. I can't vouch for other bands (FM) but this really didn't work for me. Too bad most manufacturers consider AM bands an after thought. :-("
2,Poor quality FM radio,Not that good.Analog tuner can only tune in to strong FM transmissions.Often times it has problems with excluding adjacent stations such there is signal interference/cross talk.You get what you pay for. My advice is to spend another $10 and get something worth while.
1,Junk,This is a piece of junk. Don;t waste your money. Tone quality is awful. Should be taken off the market..
3,Served it's purpose,"It's a small, cheap radio and does not give the greatest quality. I was looking for something cheap that would entertain me and my strict job. It does just that."
3,was too small for my use,I didn't realize it was so small and had to order a larger one. oh well. that happens. I gave this one away.
4,Coby cx-71,Great little radio works well indoors and out I got it to use in the werehouse at work and its great.
5,Great for the gym,"After reading many reviews decided to purchase and glad I did! Works great on the treadmill rather than trying to read the closed caption delayed text. Great price, nice item. AM & FM works great as well especially with the bass boost feature"
1,Run away from this one,"I wanted a small radio with AM reception for use while doing yard work. What a mistake it was to purchase this piece of junk!!! FM reception is spotty, AM is almost non-existent! If you do happen to pick up a station - Don't Move! If Coby had a conscience they would take it off the market!"
3,compact and easy to use,It is nice to fit into my smock pockets when I am with elderly clients and hidden from their sight when I listen to it. It can catch some stations but not very good clarity reception. It is okay for a compact radio.
5,Good Cover band,"This cd is great. I bought it at a local record shop in Chicago, and listened to it and could not believe how good they were. This band definately needs to be signed to a major label."
1,Would Be Rated Zero Stars If That Was An Option,"Ordered one, despite the reviews, and it arrived DOA.Amazon very quickly sent out a replacement, with expedited shipping (way to go Amazon), but that too was DOA.Don't bother with this unit, which by the way is not an Axion, it is ACTION. Even the cardboard box it is packaged in is cheap and recycled. Too bad.I am going to order a different brand, one that is rated highly!!!"
2,"Disappointing reception, nice picture and price.","I was very disappointed that through no fault of this product, in the Cleveland/Akron area, I only could receive one channel inside or out. It is ideal though for hooking up a video game, DVD player, or any other video source, and the AM-FM radio is a great feature. Also, just a non-solicited note, I want to thank Amazon for carrying this and similar obscure products. I searched Best Buy, Circuit City and Wal-Mart (smaller electronics section so I understand)looking for a similar product to no avail. Through product reviews and customer comments, I was able to get much more information here than at the retailers. Ultimately, I did return the TV to Amazon."
2,TVreviewer,"Any TVs from AXION or American Action should be avoided. I hear nothing but trouble about them, and I have recently purchased an TFT LCD 3.2"" color TV by AXION, and it's a big disappointment. This type of TV is fine, if it's not from American Action or AXION. I have a Sylvania that looks exactly like this one, and it works great! Just don't buy an AXION or American Action model, and it will be ok."
1,Disappointed,"I was quite unhappy with this TV and as a result returned it. The audio was poor, the picture was poor and the controls were hard to operate. Amazon.com generally provides good products; however, in this case they slipped badly."
5,No insult to Eminem...,"I am far beyond the age of a typical Eminem listener. After listening to the clips and buying ""Put Some Style Into It"", (performed by an entirely different group of musicians). I thought this album would be a real hoot. It delivers all that and more. The arrangements are cool and Eminem himself would probably be proud that his music is reaching a different segment.This is a real shocker when you consider most of the explicit language is retained to mostly hilarious lounge arrangements.There is a clever use of percussion throughout though unlike that used in rap. Vibes and guitars glissen, and theres' a touch of brass on a couple of selections. This is not really a tribute but a good natured spoof to Eminem! To all you rappers,heres the perfect way to introduce yourselves to salsa, lounge/jazz and soul. Sorry that this rendition will likely outlast the originator as time passes on."
1,This album is an insult to the word joke,C'mon man...y'all can't be serious. The singers on this album are whiter than a polar bear covered in flour. I just wanna hear what Eminem has to say about this garbage. These guys couldn't hold VANILLA ICE's jock strap...and that's saying something
1,Let's face it,"How long are we going to delude ourselves with that kind of message ? From the very beginning of the book a doubtful story about rabbis let us in the tune with what we'll have to accept if we are to get the ""master""'s approval. Of course each and every of our suffering is supposed to be a proof of our ""foolishness"". So if you follow this reasoning : every one who's suffering does deserve it. Killed children deserve it ? Raped women deserved it ? Humiliated, exploited, tortured men DESERVE IT ? The answer is yours."
4,Small but to the point,"These dragon fly earrings are very small and cute. They're so light that I'm afraid I'm going to bend them every time I touch them, but I suspect they're a bit more hardy than they feel. Personally I'd prefer them to be just a little bit bigger but they're nice."
2,HELLO! LISTEN TO YOURSELVES,"BEFORE YOU BUY THIS BOOK PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MAN MAKES A LIVING OFF OF BEING A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER NOT A REAL ESTATE INVESTOR!! IF HE WAS SUCH A GREAT REAL ESTATE INVESTOR DON'T YOU THINK THE MEDIA WOULD BE ALL OVER HIM LIKE DONALD TRUMP!!! THE MEDIA RECENTLY TRUMPED HIM FOR HIS CLAIM TO CREATE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MILLIONAIRES BUT HAS YET TO PRODUCE ONE? I SAY APPROACH WITH CAUTION IF THIS GUY WAS MAKING SO MUCH MONEY IN REAL ESTATE WHY WOULD HE NEED TO SELL BOOKS? IF IT IS SOOOO EASY HE SHOULD BE MEDIA POPULAR! BUT HE IS NOT BECAUSE ""HE"" IS NOT!!!!"
5,Highly recommended,"When I bought my first home back in the 1970's, the average price was $23,400. By the end of the decade the price was up to $44,200. By the mid 1980's the price was up to $79,800 and today it is well over $150,000 depending on what part of the country you live in.The home that I bought 30 years ago has generated an incredible return for me. I only wish that I would have had this book back then and bought 5, 10, 20 or more!Nothing Down will show you how to buy real estate in todays markets and how you can always make great profits irregardless of the economy.And one more thing; with all of the lost jobs thanks to the Clinton recession, I would think that there has never been a better time than now to take advantage of the techniques as espoused and developed by the great Robert G. Allen."
2,Cheaper form of the Carlton Sheets plan,"If you are looking to invest in some property and make a little side income, this book is helpful, but forget about the ""road to riches!!!"" path. The way to make money off depressed properties is, like Sheets and Allen, to write a book that (supposedly) tells other people how to do it. Sheets is being sued for fraud in several states. Visit the fraud and multilevel marketing scam sites for the lowdown on this ""investment plan"" and realistic figures as to what someone can actually achieve. Take warning before you read this."
1,No Shortcuts.,"Disciples of Allen aren't going to like what I have to say and if they have an MLM mindset they'll want to call me a ""dream stealer""; so be it. First off I strongly recommend the guru ratings page on Jack Reed's website. He is the real deal, a true investor and not some seminar hustler. Secondly anyone wanting to get rich won't be able to do it quick or easy especially if they are poorly educated and unskilled. A degree really does matter. Think about it. Trying to go from $7/hr to millionaire status is a bit delusional but Allen and some others will happily take the money of the unhappy and the desperate. This book is like all his others. Save your money."
5,A Quality book deserving of the # 1 rating at Amazon,It's GREAT to see that a quality book by a quality man has made the #1 spot here at Amazon. Robert Allen is all about empowering people. He is a man of quality and his advice works. I highly recommend Nothing Down for the 2000's for anyone seeking cash flow or an alternative to social insecurity.Also recommned The 1 Minute Millionaire by Allen and The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren. These are all quality books.Beware of dubious authors who write garbage about prominent people only because it sells. Tabloids have high ratings. Some CBS tv news shows have ratings. But where is the quality?
4,Teaches a lot,"I can see why people are successful reading this book. Interestingly, he begins with the real issue in one's life - what do they really want to do with their lives?"
1,Save Your Money,"This book reminds me so much of the first book I read by Robert Allen, Nothing down for the 90's. Some cutting and pasting, a few new words of wisdom and there you have it. Easier money than flipping a property!I caught site of the last couple of reviews - do not waste your money. If you have one of this authors books you have them all.I also took a look at multiple streams of internet income - looks like the same trick.This author is so prolific it is a miracle he has time to make a property deal. If I weren't so trusting I'd think he made all his money in the book business.Great book for people who love get rich quick fiction!Reviewers who liked this book also rate highly:Unfit to Command: Swift Boat Vets Trash KerrySome liked it so much they reviewed it more than once!!!!!!!!!They follow the vote now vote often school - guess they applied the same integrity to reviewing this book !!!!!!! Unless they are paid ....."
2,A major disappointment,"As a geographer with an interest in the opening of the west I looked forward the this book. Unfortunately it is poorly written and repetitious, and half-way through King's life the author appears to lose interest in the subject. There is nothing about the rivalry between King's Survey and the other great surveys led by Powell, Hayden and Wheeler that lead to the establishment of the U. S. Geological Survey. Nor is there any mention of the political fighting between King and Ferdinand Hayden that led to King's selection as the first director of that agency. A major disappointment."
4,Great trip into the times of Clarence King,"This book does not discuss in much detail the USGS and the second half of Clarence's life but it places you in the times of King and during some of the most interesting parts of his adventures in the West. I really enjoyed the book and found that the author created an interesting angle by carefully reviewing King's upbringing, religious beliefs and how he squared his religious convictions with an education and career in science during the mid 1800s.This is not a historical tome but a fairly light read where the author keeps the material interesting. It is like a rock skipping over the surface of his life. A good read that leaves me hoping others will write additional books to tell other parts of his story."
3,Intriguing read,"An absorbing biography of famed geologist Clarence King.I must admit that while not totally ignorant in the sciences, I had never heard of the man.In his early twenties he accomplished many outstanding feats while climbing, mapping and geologizing in California's high Sierra Nevada mountains. Then, at the age of twenty-five he was placed in charge of the fortieth parallel scientific expedition across the western U. S. The culmination of his career was uncovering the great diamond hoax in northwestern Colorado.All this field work and close observation of the natural and physical world lead King to his own geological theories of time, space and evolution. For the first half of his life the man was highly regarded and respected for both his demeanor and scientific contributions. Sadly, the second half of his life he basically ""fell off the planet ""."
4,"Not really Troma, but hot!","This might be very funny. I've never actually listened to the audio. There are a few good ""bank"" moments, so I suppose it's worth one run through, maybe two. Don't expect Oscar level story or performances. Give me real Troma!"
4,Guitare Christmas,"Guitar Christmas at its ""Trio"" best! Definitly ""great & different"" - in nice ways! Music is a personal thing-we all have our own interests...."
4,A Good Beginner's Guide,"""Yesterday's Cincinnati"" is a good beginner's guide into Cincinnati histories. The pictures are numerous and informative; the text is instructive, and sometimes witty. This pictorial history 's strongest point is also its weakest: it is brief. This is good, in that it sparks the reader's interest to delve deeper into Cincinnati's past: how sudden was the '37 flood; just who WAS Boss Cox; what ever became of the defunct subway system? But these things are not explained in this brief history, and leaves the reader wanting more, yet not pointing him or her in a direction in which more can be found.As a beginner's guide in the histories of a city, I rate this book rather highly, because of its brevity. If you are interested in a glimpse under the crown of the Queen City from her beginnings to the mid-1900's, Luke Feck provides a wonderful starting step for you!"
1,Almost beyond belief,"When I listened to this I couldn't believe it. I thought there must be something wrong with my stereo. Nope. In the studio, they actually created this monstrosity. Rod McKuen plows along, muttering, submerged in waves of san sebastian strings. Like a whale, he occasionaly surfaces long enough for two or three words to be distinguished. These random, incoherent words are like auditory hallucinations in a bad psychadelic event. The emotional effect? Not romantic when husband is checking the wires on the back of the stereo. Wife says she can't understand the words either, and it's creeping her out. Now husband has his ohmmeter out, he's getting serious! Does this sound like the beginning of a romantic evening?"
2,No good for Argentina,"My family come from Argentina and I teach the language. But it is hard to find the right course books and tapes. Most is for Peninsular Spanish, like this one. There are some books for Mexican Spanish. We need also a course for the language of Argentina. The pronunciation is different to European Spanish. Words are different too. There are different structures like the vos standard form of address and the verbal conjugations to go with it. This Linguaphone may suit those who want to go to Spain, but what about Argentina?"
1,Review of Ménage,"Considering the stars of this movie, I expected more. I don't think the problem was with the acting, rather the problem was the script. The whole story was unbelievable and the ending especially so, although seeing Gerard Depardieu and Michel Blanc in drag was mildly amusing. If you want to see this movie, rent it. Don't buy it unless it's really cheap."
1,"Great acting, bizarre script, stupid message, weird ending.","I love French movies but this one was more annoying and disgusting than interesting or funny,.This movie is the most bizarre of them all.The first 20 minutes had some promise to it, but after that things went downhill.I am not a big fan of homosexuality, and this movie is up to its neck in it.Would never recommend it to my friends, would never watch it again.My husband walked out after watching the first 25 minutes.In fact, I am embarrassed to keep it in my house.Getting rid of it.And the ending was like HUH???"
3,Reading the fine print won't help!,"Decent, comfortable headphones made out of garden variety plastic which makes them a little overpriced. Also, don't count on getting an equalizer if you use a MAC, even though they don't tell you at the company's web site. PC's only here. No equalizer. The USB hook up is nice (you can't use the USB connections on your keyboard, though....they don't tell you that up front either) and the sound is pretty good but if you were counting on custom tailoring your sound output with a nifty equalizer, you can only do that if you're using a PC."
5,Innova Classicor Stainless-Steel,"works great, looks great,good price, top handle get's a little hot so you have to use a hot pad.I'm a Chef of 30+ years and I know about cookware and this is perfect for home use, nice thick bottom for heat spred, top fits perfect as well. don't worry about the discolor of the inside from pasta or starchy foods,it's ok, your cooking with it!"
4,stainless steel,"my first stainless steel cookware. this set is nice. not the nicest set available, but a good price. the ad says it is oven safe, but actually only to 350 degrees, but who needs to cook any higher? you would still want to have a couple of teflon pans in your collection for items that don't do well on stainless steel. i do like the set, but my only critique is that a wish one of the pans were larger, and also the pasta strainer doesn't fit like i expected it to and so i have yet to use it.overall a good set for the price"
4,Good quality saucepan set,"I am happy with my purchase. The saucepans heat up in no time - this caught me by surprise the first time I used them. The fry pan gets super hot very quickly and I would never use more than medium high heat for this pan otherwise you will burn your food. Make sure you read the instructions before use as there are some recommendations were different from my previous cookware. All pieces are easy to clean - even with baked on food. Although dishwasher safe, I have not gotten good results cleaning in the dishwasher alone and prefer to hand wash."
5,Excellent Cookware,"I recently purchased the Innova Classicor set of pans. As a previous owner of this cookware, I was thrilled to find it online. I love the new lids. They are easy to clean, and comfortable on the hands. I'm vegan, allergic to milk, so I do a lot of my own cooking. These pots and pans are a dream to work with."
5,Still Awesome!!!,"My brother got this set for Christmas in 1997. I use it everyday and still love it. Although it is getting time to get another set, I have shopped around and keep coming back to these... think I'll treat myself this Christmas!"
1,a rip off company,innova does not support there warranty.HSN does not support them its a big ripoff and the company has failed the public amazon should stop selling there cookware
4,"good pots, especially for the money","I was looking for non-teflon pans and these pans are do the job. The handles get hot, but that is to be expected. They are dishwasher safe and eggs are a little hard to cook. Also, don't use a scrub pad, instead use a brush and the powder ""Bartender's Best Friend"" to clean. I would buy again."
2,Not what I expected,"My friend has a set of Innova Cookware from a few years ago and I used them while cooking at her house. Her set was great. It cooked the food well and cleaned up very nicely. So I decided to buy a set of my own. This set is great with all the pieces and sizes for my cooking needs. However, on the first use of the 10"" pan it burned what I was cooking and its been a little tough trying to get that off of the bottom. That must be because I'm use to cooking with non-stick which has a higher heat requirement. So I gave it another shot. It burns food very quickly if you don't watch it and the cover's handles are made of metal so it gets hot. I would not really recommend this set to anyone and if you're planning on buying it I would go with the 11 piece with non-stick coating. And make sure the covers do not have metal handles. Hope this helps."
3,shiny but with flaws,"The time I opened the set, it lighted up my kitchen. However, after the first use, I was ready to return the set. The bottom of the pot showed a set of white spots that I couldn't get rid of. Later I decided it didn't affect its function as a pot and just kept it. The other drawback is the handles and knobs on the covers get hot easily while cooking. I bought it at sale price, so it's still a deal for what I paid for. But I won't buy another set for sure."
1,Frying pans in this set are no good.,"I got this, used it for 2 weeks and the copper bottoms on the frying pans popped off. Not good.I'm okay with the pots and lids, but frying is what I love to do. I love eggs, sunny-side up. And now I have no frying pans. :("
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"As I prefer the vintage Nancy stories, this one bored me. It's good if you like the modernized Nancy. I just don't."
4,Like it a lot,I liked its the story line a lot. It was a very interesting and fun to read. I really like Nancy Drew!
2,Is this one really from Kraft Foods???,"At the time when I write this, the photo shows a teacup above the name Postum on the label.This one IS NOT FROM KRAFT FOODS, but instead it is the replication/reproduction from Eliza's Quest Food (in a plastic jar). I tried both, and they don't taste the same to me.I suggest that the listing be corrected, by either changing the manufacturer's name or the picture, since they don't match."
1,"A POOR, POOR Substitute for OLD Postum","I loved Postum growing up. Was very bummed it went away. Was thrilled it was coming back. So thrilled I bought a case of New Postum. What a monumental let down. New Postum is not even close to Old Postum. It doesn't dissolve the same, it doesn't smell the same, and worst of all it doesn't taste the same. It tastes horrid! NEW Postum is flat out bad. I also agree with another post that the marketing SHOULD NOT say ""Original"" since it clearly is not.Can't be more disappointed in NEW Postum."
1,DISSATISFIED WITH THE TIME FRAME FOR SHIPMENT!,"I am very dissatisfied with the 3rd party shipper of this item, Netgrocer. The order did not ship until 5 days after it was ordered. I have tried to contact Netgrocer 5 times to resolve this, with NO call back. I paid nearly $12 for shipping and it took nearly 10 days to reach the destination by FedEx! It could have been shipped regular mail faster than that! I would like to have the shipping credited back to my card, but I cannot get in touch with anyone from Netgrocer! Until this is resolved, I will NOT order from Amazon or Netgrocer again.Jennifer Nawracaj"
5,Postum is back on the Market!!!,"Postum has been brought back to the market and is available online.If anyone is interested in the original recipe Postum it is only available on the web at the moment, but has just been reintroduced back into the market!!!Long live Postum!!![...]"
4,History of 19th Century Hawaii,"I bought this book as research for a project that I am doing concerning the life of Liliuokalani. Though the book doesn't add much to her story, it contains a wealth of information on the Hawaiian monarchy and the conspiracies that led to it's downfall. This is not an unslanted book. I think that the authors viewpoint is pretty clear throughout. But it is passionately argued and I think hard to refute.Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning more about one of the great injustices of the American 19th century."
3,Most valuable for discussion of Gerrit Parmele Bishop's influence,"This book gets 5 stars for what it reveals about ABCFM missionary Gerrit Parmele Judd's influence on the Kingdom of Hawai'i. It's a bit weaker in other areas, lacks the precision expected of an expert and consequently leaves holes in the information presented that reflects the author's lack of experience in a peer-reviewed arena. It is rather sloppily organized with no apparent help from an experienced editor. The index is primarily a list of person names and pages where they are discussed--a very limited number of subjects is listed in the index. Regardless of these criticisms, this is an essential volume for understanding gaining an understanding of Hawaiian history in the 19th century--at least until scholarship of this area can be taken up by a wider group of highly trained academics with the editorial support of a larger publisher."
2,Expecting rainbows,"I bought this one along with two other colored, smaller ones. This one doesn't give off any rainbows, but does make the other two look better in the window."
5,My most favorite purchase,Out of all the items I have bought on Amazon this is by far my most favorite piece. It arrived within days of ordering. The cut quality and sparkle of this crystal was above standard. I will definitely be ordering from this vendor again and again. More than satisfied.
4,Great Oldies Rock,"Bobby Vee is AMAZING, I have seen him in concert probably 25 times since I was in 6th grade (I am now 27). This is one of my favorite recordings of his. Younger people need to listen to this and see what real music sounds like.My favorites: ""Suzie Baby"", Toy Soldier"" & ""Party Doll""** Note ** On ""Party Doll"" the drum is actually a cardboard box."
2,"There was no ""real"" time video, just some guy speaking fast.","Too much talk and not enough real video. Just some drawings, and a guy speaking faster than comprehension. Thought there might be some video on how it is applied to real world, but instead, just how it could be applied in theory. Not very happy with this. 58 minutes long"
2,"Dated, whirlwind treatment of a complex subject","This tape appears to have been made at least 15+ years ago. The referenced navigation texts by Mr. Gonder are no longer in print. Unfortunately, the approach is to recite rather than to teach. Complex subjects are covered in haste. No summaries are made for detailed subjects like lighting or signals. The only purpose this tape served was to convince me to allocate more preparation time for the test, which I appreciated. Recommend some of the newer versions by Magic Lamp's Safe Boating Series."
1,Save your money.,"I bought this thinking it was the same as an official Microsoft play and charge kit.....man was I wrong. The battery would only hold a charge for 4 hours tops before it needed recharging. Now after a month, the battery won't hold a charge at all. Don't waste your money on this, fork over the extra 5$ for an official charge kit."
3,Brilliant Onscreen; Too Much for my Stereo,"No one will deny that Danny Elfman is a musical genius, whose unique style defies conventional Hollywood scoring. However, I found this score somewhat difficult to listen to independent of the film. The haunting melodies are an essential part of Tim Burton's artistic vision on the screen, but they are a little bit too dark and urgent for my general listening tastes. If you are looking for an orchestral score that more soothing and refined, try anything by Thomas Newman."
4,not as good as BEETLEJUICE,"I FELT THAT BEETLEJUICE WAS A BETTER SCORE THAN SLEEPY HALLOW, BUT OVERALL SLEEPY HALLOW WAS AN OUTSTANDING SOUNDTRACT THAT GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS EVERY TIME I HEAR IT. THE SOUNDTRACT WORKS INCREDIBILY WELL WITH THE MOVIE, AND IF YOU SEE THE MOVIE FIRST EVERY TIME YOU HEAR THE SCORE YOU GET THE FEELING OF THE MOVIE FROM THE MUSIC"
4,Sleepy Hollow,"It was a good movie and all, but it needed some work on it. i JUST THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE PG-13 INSTEAD OF RATED-R YOU KNOW?But besides that, IT WAS GREAT!I LOVED IT OTHER WISE!"
5,Nothing short of classic Elfman,"I bought this score simply because I knew it would not disappoint. Elfman has always bought a certain something to films which only he and John Williams can, a sense of excitement and a melody that sticks in the back of your mind. A masterpiece of cinematic score that underlines the feeling of terror and adventure (and a bit of humour) that the film delivers to the audience. If you are a soundtrack buff, buy it now. He and Tim Burton are the saviours of cinema in a world of over-hype and poor production values"
5,Elfman yet again makes a great movie even better,"If you have seen 'Sleepy Hollow' and have even half considered buying the score, do so and you will not be sorry. I was not a big fan of either Burton or Elfman until this film came along and now I am so glad that I not only saw and enjoyed the film, but bought this CD. I listen to this score every day and find that I am more and more pleased with it within each listening. It has the perfect blend: near completion, Danny Elfman's haunting action and just plain haunting, and a great movie to match up with. The only thing that I do not like about it is that the CD leaves out small little cues of music here and there, especially in #10 which takes place during the fight with the horseman on the bridge in the film - that entire 10 minute song is missing 10 seconds, why not put it in there? Anyways, this is a great catch and I'm looking foward to buying more and more Elfman CDs as the year progresses."
2,Worked great! ......at FIRST,Bought product to replace dimmer switch in lamps I did not want to replace since I had purchased with my recently deceased wife. Instructions on back of package are simple enough to go by if you have any common sense and can read a diagram. Was very proud to bring lamp back to life and cycled through levels just like new. Only to be shot down a week later after lamp no longer worked at all. Rechecked wiring to make sure connections were secure and problem was not on my end. I checked and can see why these are no longer carried in any of the area Ace retail stores. I played the lottery and this one was a loser.
2,Well there were unmitigated circumstances,"The replacement was larger than the original. The replacement wiring was a different color than the original. When I saw this I contacted Amazon who quickly handed me off to Ace who quickly handed me off to the manufacturer. The manufacturer suggested I take the $7 replacement part on the $35 lamp to an electrician. Cost wise this wasn't an option. I am a widow and not all that knowledgeable on wiring but I thought if I could get the mfr to match up the color of the replacement wires to the original wires I could handle it. And I did, except when I attempted to put the lamp back together the wire nuts fell off, the wiring came loose and I had no idea what went where. I bought some crimpable wirenuts, guessed at the connection and the lamp is now working and has not burned the house down to date.I did get great service from all representatives... The size and wire colors were wrong."
5,Algebra 1,This book was in excellent condition. The delivery was as promised.The pages are in tact and we will make great use of it. I strongly recommend this site for ALL your book needs!!
3,Solid and workman-like effort from pop pros.,"Songwriters Chris Difford and Glen Tilbrook are back with three new bandmates. The lyrics dig deeper than ever, but this release lacks the hooks and vibrancy of Ridiculous in 1995. Production, obviously done on a shoe string budget, is of sub-standard quality. However, run of the mill Squeeze is still far better than the vast majority of music available. Loyal fans won't be disappointed, while others will wonder ""how come these guys aren't famous?"""
4,Don't bother................,"I think they have gone out of business, there's no response to emails sent to them....but it was a great product!"
1,Bad!,"This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. First, there are the spelling errors. I'm not just talking about typos (and there are some of those). For example, twice the word ""maxim"" meaning adage or saying is spelled ""maximum."" Then there are the grammatical errors. Sentences just end. They have a subject but no predicate. And, there is the subject matter. It's like the author took hundreds of ideas from other authors and randomly put them together. I don't know who to blame. Supposedly the book was edited by a gentleman with a Phd. in English. I'd be horrified if he was my professor. If anyone does not believe me, please somehow get a copy (don't buy it)and read it. You'll be begging to read Iannone. The only reason I read it was because it was required reading for a police promotional exam."
2,What a hard book to stay with.,I am only briefly into this book. Boring dry and mundane is what I am experiencing. What a hard book to try to get through. Hope it goes some place soon. This is like a bad movie.
1,Rusted and stained counter 1st time used,"The first time I used this pan (to hard boil eggs), I rinsed it and placed it upside down on a counter to drain. When I picked it up the next morning the rim had rusted and left a large stain on the counter. So much for stainless steel."
1,Low-quality product,"The product looked great, but after couple week some tiny dark spots started to appear - it looked like the stainless steel started to come off. (I used it to cook oatmeal and didn't use metal utensils with it). I wasn't able to return it due to my own fault - I burned it, so I don't know how good they are with refunds."
1,A real misfortune of a book,This book contains a lot of words it is outdated and not interesting at any point.I bought this bokk to my kindle and can not now erase it. Shame
2,Readable but not very deep,"This is an easy to read but uneven book. Some discussions are pretty clearly exposed, mainly the technical ones. But it's not a balanced view of quantum field theory. E.g.,the author deservedly bashes some philosophers of physics but then puts everybody in the same basket. He keeps hamming in the quest for unification which is a research program with deep philosophical roots. The argument for a ""final theory"" is not convincing; in fact one wonders if it makes any sense at all. In fact it is not discussed in a critical way. Also, there's no comments about the work of the mathematical physicists concerning the axiomatic or constructive point of view of the theory, which, it seems, is not very encouraging. But, for those who feel that canceling infinities is all right, as long that it works, no problemo..."
2,Tedious with a few exceptions,"I really could only stand two chapters: Against Philosophy and What about God? The rest of the book was really dull, if you're not a physics buff. Oh, and the chapter on the Super Collider was about as boring as you would expect, especially reading it a decade later."
1,Incomprehensible,"Although I have little to no education in physics, chemistry or mathematics, I have an IQ of 140, a degree in law and I have read (and even written some) philosophy, so I don't usually have problems with conceptualizing. Having said that as background, as a layman, I found this book to be completely incomprehensible. Although not religious, it is as if Weinberg is speaking in tounges, droning on and on about every physics and chemistry concept and theory from antiquity to present, without ever pausing for a single moment to actually explain any of them. I dare anyone who does not have at least a basic grounding in physics to explain anything Weinberg has said about physics in this book. Weinberg makes much of the ""whys"" of science, but to me, the greatest unexplained ""why"" of this book is why was it published."
2,Not as pictured,"The stock photograph is not the same cutlass that arrived. I am a historian with a museum, trying to put on a Naval display. The stock photograph is of a better made reproduction. The one I received has a very different blade, which makes it less sturdy and an inaccurate reproduction."
3,A Great Deal of Adjustment Needed,"This guitar looked good. However, there was a lot of buzz in the strings. This was temporarily fixed with a neck adjustment. Sounded okay for a short time (2 days), but has since required 2 more adjustments. Have never had an instument require so much tweeking."
2,"Pretty watch, but screwy watch","I got this watch a few weeks ago. When it arrived, I was very impressedby its design and weight. Its a serious piece of heavy metal, and very cool looking. HOWEVER....after setting the time and playing with the stop watch function, the watch went haywire, displaying jibberish and making painful noises. I returned it to the seller, for another one (seller did a good job)I set the time, I tried using the stopwatch again. Instead of crapping out, it just reset itself back to 12:00 am. I reset the time, and vowed never to use the alarm or stop watch functions. To sum things up. Its a pretty watch, but I wish it worked better. I kept it cause I like how it looks, and don't really need the other functions."
4,no nonsense watch,"Being an ol'fart, i wanted a no nonsense watch that i could actually read without reaching for my reading glasses.this nike watch fills the bill very nicely,it's a little heavy but that's because it's built rather well,..my only real complaint is that once in a while for no apparant reason it'll lose all it's settings and you'll have to reset everything,..annoying but all in all it's a pretty nice watch for the price."
4,History Toots It's Horn,"Great historical document of a side trip on our Presidents visit to Europe in 1995. Bill Clinton's sax is robust yet tenative. Casual but enthusiastic version of My Funny Valentine is the major piece but it's just fun to hear a Great guy enjoying himself and demonstrating to the rest of the world that we are a culture-loving, fun-loving and artistic nation. Sound quality is what you would expect fron a dimly lit night club, which is exactly where this was recorded. Kudos to Bill & a treasure for the rest of us."
2,warning!,my wife accidentally put the bottom pan in the top. they are not clearly marked. There is no way on earth that could separate these pots now. they are completely stuck together.
5,I LOVE Innova Classicor,I have a set of Innova Classicor and I love them. I have had them for about 10 years and I haven't had any problems with them. My set didn't come with the double boiler so I decided to get this one. It also could be used as a spare 2 qt. sauce pan.
2,Baby Boomers Need Help After Retirement,"I read the book more for the benefit of my parents than for myself. I was looking for a book that could help answer questions about what my parents problems today. This book is intended for individuals who are saving for retirement today, which many are living paycheck to paycheck like our parents did."
5,Donny McClurkin-SOUNDS OF TRUTH,"Donny McClurkin's strong, ""straight to the heart from the heart"" style penetrates the atmosphere with truth that cannot be resisted as he asks the question ""What Do You Do?"" in the opening lines of ""STAND"". His soul-searching ode to the one true God in ""JESUS,THE MENTION OF YOUR NAME"" has made even agnostics shed a tear or two. In two words, this album is a MUST HEAR."
1,"Barely works, damages paper.","Even when cutting a single piece of paper, it tends to stick and tear paper instead of cutting it. Only very steady and somewhat rapid movement of the blade has a somewhat reasonable *chance* of producing a proper cut. And this is with a brand new trimmer - where the blade is presumably very sharp - how would it work after the blade becomes a little dull???"
4,Good for the price,"I bought this trimmer for the few cases where scissors just don't cut it (pardon the pun). As other reviewers have said, it can be difficult to get the paper held squarely, especially for small pieces (say, smaller than a business card). This is a combined problem of the plastic hold-down being very wide (nice for larger work) and the alignment fence being a bit on the small side.Overall, though, for less than $20, it's a great buy. I haven't had any trouble with tearing paper (up to 100# card stock), and the cut edges seem nice and crisp."
3,Works!,"Ok, the trimmer works fine and is the perfect size for me. However, I can only line up the paper on one side of the trimmer because if I line it up on the other side, the cut is going to be slanted. No big deal, just remember to test out the trimmer on some random paper before using it on photos. The trimmer can only go through one page which isn't too bothersome. If you cut regular A4 paper, its fine but if I try it on semi thicker paper, its a struggle to push the trimmer through.I rated this a 3 because i think all these problems were caused because of the packaging. Not only did I receive it a couple days later than I expected, the packaging inside the delivery box was completely open. I mean, come on. How are you going to sell a product that's completely open."
4,Great sound in a small package,"For as small as these monitors are, they are very good.Just 7 watts a piece and they are quite loud.I rarely get these things turned over a quarter of the way up!I decided to purchase them while living in a small studio apartment and looking for something with a pretty accurate response at low levels.I have not been disappointed.They are lacking in bass but if used with a cheap subwoofer they sound great."
2,Sounds too clever for its own good,"I'm sure Beck is talented. I saw him open up for Dylan with a solo acoustic set. But by covering everything in layers of electronic music, and using synthesizers like it was the early eighties, he makes himself sound quite average. I'm not even sure the songs on this album are up to standard. I think he spends too much time worrying about what sound effect or musical genre he wants to cover, rather than writing the outstanding songs he is capable of. This album sounds a little too silly, and Beck is completely unbelievable as a soul singer"
4,All in fun.,"Beck's new record is a happy/funny/party album, not meant to be taken seriously. He hasn't written lyrics this goofy since the ""old"" days. I'm a Beck fan, and a firm believer that his best stuff is One Foot and Mutations, but I wouldn't compare this to them because it's just for fun. If you don't get Beck's sense of humor you won't get into this record."
4,Just your usual Beck disc...,"Like The artist formerly known as Prince--another musical genius--Beck may occasionally misfire (as he does a couple of times on Midnite Vultures) but he will never be dull or uninteresting.Overall, this disc isn't quite to the standard of say, Odelay, but it still merits a purchase."
4,Let's Make It Funky..,"Midnute Vultures, whoa. What an album. You wouldn't think a loser like Beck could party so hard, but he pulls it off quite well. Fans of Odelay may be dissappointed with this record, but any openminded listeners should get a lot out of it. Beck's offkilter rhymes are bizarre as ever, but this time, they're backed up by ridiculously tight funk grooves instead of guitar rock. My favorite song is Mixed Bizness, offering more sick rhymes, a sicker break (I want to know if I'm worth your time..) and further embellishments. It kind of sounds like Kraftwerk if they ever incorporated heavy funk into their electronic drones. This album basically departs from all else Beck has ever put his name on. It's nothing like his other albums, but the rehashed funk/soul vibe is as invigorating as anything else Beck has set his heart to. Recommended."
4,Don't compare it against what came before!,"The biggest thing that Beck did wrong with this album is that he made his previous two releases too damn good! That's what is bothering everyone. If you just look at it on its own merits (and possibly strike tracks 4 and 5) it's damn good stuff. And Nicotine & Gravy is awesome. So, it's not a five-star disc like Mutations, but it's definitely way above average."
3,Beck Party 2000--LOADS OF FUN,"Beck said Midnite Vultures would be a ""dumb party album"" for the year 2000, and indeed it is. And it also happens to be LOADS of FUN. For all those who criticize Vultures as a rip-off, since when was a party/dance album supposed to contain intelligent lyrics? Substantive songs? Check out Beck's Mutations or One Foot in the Grave if that's what you're looking for. See Odelay if you're looking for innovation. But for a good time, call the Vultures hotline. You'll still be laughing over it long after you've stopped shaking your booty."
5,Beck Rocks,"Beck (Hanson) rules the world. He is a pure musician, demonstrating many different styles of music in an album (pick any of his) and he makes it work. His lyrics, although sometimes odd and/or illegible, work with his style to create music that flows. If you don't own anything of his work you are just plain ignorant."
2,"Sorry, Beck, I don't get it","Maybe I'm musically naive, but I don't get this CD. Too bad, because I loved Odelay and really liked Mutations. Oh well."
2,The joke ain't funny,"This is a really bad parody of a soul album. It doesn't work in the least. All of the grooves have been done better before, and those originals aren't laden down with Beck's snide attitude, stupid stupid stupid lyrics, pointlessly weird noises, mediocre melodies, and the general ""processed"" vibe that burdens this CD.Really dumb, monotonous, hokey, and ultimately annoying."
5,BECK HAS DONE IT AGAIN!,Excellent album with lots of good tracks. If you liked Odeley you'll love this one. This album starts strong and ends strong. The track Debra is worth the price of admission. Check it out.
3,"Initially disappointing, but it grows on you.","I love Beck's music, almost unconditionally, but there are a few songs on this album that I just can't sit through, no matter how hard I try to like it. He ventures a bit too far into disco/funk/r&b retro territory for my tastes (and I really can't handle falsetto, no matter who it is coming from). I've followed Beck through a wide range of musical styles, from ""One Foot in the Grave"" to this most recent offering, and until now I basically thought he could do no wrong. Admittedly, there are a few great songs on here, but as a whole I have to say it's a bit weak."
3,Did You Ever Let A Cowboy Sit on Your Lap?,"Beck asks that musical question and explores many other even kinkier areas in his one man homage to Prince Rogers Nelson and 80s excess and sex-cess, ""mixing business with leather."" Despite the Master P references in the lyrics, this could easily be the lost Prince masterwork as envisioned by Beck, meticulously reproducing the Purple One's sound and even approaching his off-kilter mindset. Flawlessly produced, one song flows into the next to present a unified and very funky whole. Not as accessible as ""Odelay,"" but enjoyable for fans of Beck, funk and, especially, Prince."
3,What the funk?,"I am a Beck fan no doubt, but this album gets listened to less and less by me. After playing it for a few years now, I realized that I really only like 3 songs from it: ""Sexx Laws"", ""Mixed Bizness"", and ""Debra"". The thing is, those songs are absolutely amazing! But the rest has just become noise to me. Some of the other tracks are good, just not real good. I can't get rid of this because of those three songs, ""Mixed Bizness"" is just insane, and ""Debra"" has the smoothest groove, and funniest lyrics. Get this used, or pick up ""Mellow Gold"", or ""Sea Change""."
3,good fun,"hokey-high voice man-gets it on with his plan!This is a love album, a soul album and a funk album all in one...If you like 'groovin' or feel like being slightly disturbed..try it!"
4,"New Years Eve has a soundtrack, and it's Beck's latest album","Every time 90's music revolutionary Beck puts out an album, you don't know what to expect. He's done folk, he's done rap, he's done country, he's done grunge, he's done just about everything. Except of course, for a good chunk of what you'll find on this album. 70's funk. Finally you can dance to Beck. Lots of great bass grooves and guitar licks, falsetto vocals, horns, all kinds of neat stuff. And of course, what's a Beck album without weird synth noises in the background. From the single ""Sexxlaws"" to the beautiful ""Debra"" (reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz's ""It Ain't Over Til It's Over""), this album is definitely a keeper. The only thing I don't really like is the jokey hip-hop/R&B song ""Hollywood Freaks."""
3,Beck's worst yet.,"Ah, nothing against Beck, I love him. But this ironic seventies nostalgia has got to stop. I don't know how much more pseudo-disco I can bear. Beck's compositions are exquisite, his sound textures are fantastic, the lyrics are a whole lot of fun, but there is no escaping the shagmobile on this CD, and really I think Austin Powers has exhausted the phenomenon.One thing I love is the bonus 1:03 track tucked way down after the last track on the CD: it gives me hope that Beck's next direction will be something a little more adventurous, and a little less threadbare."
2,Disappointing,A very disappointing album compared to the early albums. Sounds too much like the usual Beck trademarked sound.
3,Beck is not Prince,"There is a lot of funk in this cd and there are some great songs. Critics acclaim this album as one of the best or even the best of 1999, some of them even say that it's the best Prince album of the nineties. I can't agree with that because I think that there is a lack of emotion in Beck's work and that's why this is not true funk. I still prefer Prince ""Rave un2 the joy fantastic"" or Terry Callier last album. The best music is simple music which comes instinctively."
3,over the heads of the unenlightened,"i understand how many listeners will not understand Mr Hansen and his latest masterpiece Midnight Vultures, some people's lives thrive on staleness and banality. But I'm just glad Beck is out there for those of us who like to live a little"
2,"an entire album of ""Where it's At""","Ok. ""Where it's at"" was a good tune. But an entire album in the same style? That is basically what this is. Does it work? Not really. This record is average at best compared to Mellow Gold or Odelay.Die-hard Beck fans only need apply. I am a Beck fan, and I don't really like this. I highly suggest listening to this before you buy it. If you are expecting anything like Mellow Gold or Odelay, you will be dissapointed."
4,This is more like Kraftwerk than Prince,"This album is about 8 million years old as I write this. Who cares. I think it's pretty good and sounds better than alot of the material that anyone might still bother to listen to from that time.I've read a bunch of the reviews for this album. It sounds like the critics haven't gotten out much.If you like white funk, Beefheart, Prince, Beck and Kraftwerk, then this is a good album. 'Mixed Business' is a highlight.If you can get it cheap, buy it. It's a good listen."
4,yep,why does 'midnite vultures' not quite reach greatness? the production is great as always. the energy is electric. the cleverness drips from his words. where 'midnite vultures' does not quite compare to 'odelay' and 'mellow gold' is with the songcraft. the songs just aren't as good. 'sexx laws' is initially quite catchy but also quite grating. the same can be said for 'mixed bizness' and 'debra'. there are a couple of real winners here though. 'milk and honey' and 'pressure zone' make late appearances and the album is that much better for their presence. this is not beck's best but it certainly is worth shelling out the cash for.
5,"Pure Intoxicating Beckmusic, A Classic Album","As always, Beck never fails to give up the awesome rhymes and intriguing melodies that always play through your mind. Tracks like ""Nicotine and Gravy"" and ""Peaches and Cream"" and ""Sexx laws"" stand out. Buy this album if you've loved Beck's former stuff, it's incredible and is completely and utterly original in its flava! I'm not to crazy about his rap rendition or ""Debra"" but the rest is badass and SO WORTH LISTENING TO! Don't overlook this, folks, it completes your album collection."
2,A falsetto folly,"You can never be quite sure as to what you are going to get when you buy a Beck CD, since he is on a proverbial audio odyssey, always exploring new forms of music. But he droped the ball (or the mirophone) on this one. A meandering eleven tracks in a 80's-ish falsetto can be tolerated for only so long, and the bitter-sweet memories that are conjured up of hot pants and teased hair is one stroll down memory lane I would refrain from taking. ""Sexx Laws"" is perhaps the only tolerable track on the CD, leaving the listener to wander through a bland cacophony of mixed up mixers and random disco flashbacks."
5,"""My sales go tripple...""","I've only listened to this a couple times... and with each new time, I find myself digging it more. Excellent musicians, and production, with the same surreal mix of lyrics and styles I have come to expect from a very talented ""loser"""
4,Beck changes gear...AGAIN,"What keeps bringing me back to this artist is his lack of identifying style. His songs are covered by everyone from Johnny Cash to Cracker. On MIDNIGHT VULTURES he raps, he croons, he plays the accoustic guitar, and he manages a little NIN style sound affects too. Many point to this album's lyrics as the real catch. Not true! Beck's lyrics have always been a little bizzare. No, what will keep making you stick this one in your CD player is just how FUNKY he can be even when he's obviousely fooling around (like on track 11 DEBRA), and how on the mark he can be (like on 5 HOLLYWOOD FREAKS), and how down right rockin' he can be (on 6 PEACHES AND CREAM). But don't try to get cozy with your significant other with this album playing. True to Beckness he's stuck in a hideaous cocophony of noise as a so-called ""hidden track"" at the end which will have you rushing to the stereo to switch it off. Excellent! He knows us too well. What a cool CD...BUY IT!"
4,"Beck cooked up a sexy stew, 70's style.",The only way to describe this funky masterpeice is that it's like doing the wild thing with eric estrada watching and coaching you.
2,Beck has turned into Prince,"A very disappointing album from the man who brought us the best album of 1998, ""Mutations"". It seems that Beck has now decided to sing like and make music like Mr Symbol himself, Prince. Apart from the first track, the excellent banjo-driven ""Sexx Laws"" (which itself could be a title of a Prince track), Beck has completely lost his identity. I believe he is trying to be something he's not, and I am amazed that none of the reviews in any of the music magazines I have read picked up on this."
4,Very good CD with nice retro feel,"This is the first Beck CD that I've bought. I've enjoyed all his singles/hits, but have been ""afraid"" to buy any of his CDs for fear that they wouldn't be good all the way through. I decided to buy Midnite Vultures because I heard it had a good funky sound...a throwback to 70s funk.I admit that on the first few listens I didn't really like it. Sure, a few tunes stuck out as good, but I found some of it to be filler.Well, following repeated listenings, I can now say that I very much enjoy this CD. Lots of strong material that took me a while to enjoy musically. While I can't yet rate it 5 stars (maybe I'll change that in another month), I can say that this is a solid CD and Beck's talent appears to be limitless."
5,Beautiful Way of Beck,"Still a favorite.Midnite vultures is great songs.Beck's sounds are unique and sometimes exotic.Wonderful listening to the odd poetry .It's vast,it's spacey and genuine sounds. have you hooked and that isn't a bad thing in this case."
5,"Not perfect, but what is?","I've owned this CD for over one year now - and I haven't stopped listening to it. Midnite Vultures is still the number 1 CD in my rotation. Never before have I not gotten at least slightly tired of an album. I only wish Beck would have put the b-side track 'Dirty, Dirty' (which is the best Beck song of all time) on with the other classics. Also, Hollywood Freaks is the best track on the disc and Beck ought to have a made a video for it."
3,Good,"First and foremost I am a big Beck fan which means when Beck puts something out I have the highest expectations. This one didn't quite grab me like his earlier efforts. With that said though I'm really glad he decided to put out this album instead of some ""Odelay 2"". The songs are all good, though they don't stick in my head like I would like them to. The one exception and without a doubt the best song on the album and perhaps his best song ever, is ""Debra"". All things considered I am still a fan and always will be."
2,Sexx Change,"If you've heard of his earlier work 'One foot in the Grave,' 'Stereopathetic..,' + 'Mellow Gold,' ...then give up. He's obviously appealing to a different sort of folk. I gave two stars for the slim possibility that he did this as a way of getting back at DGC.....for they have had some legal disagreements over his contract. If that is what he's done then power to him...otherwise I'll try to maintain a deep respect for him- as his earlier work is amongst the best! At least he didn't put another glamor shot of himself looking F%4@-able on the cover."
1,"A real turkey, but the main ingredient is ham","If you want to listen to a Prince album, buy Sign 'O the Times. If you want to listen to brilliantly skewed, quasi-nonsensical lyrics, buy a Captain Beefheart album. Do not, however, buy Midniite Vultures, a record so forcefully hip and preconceived you can smell it from miles away."
2,im not laughing,"beck goes from the extremely boring mutations CD to this extremely stupid ween type CD. beck must have had a lot of fun making this CD. sounds like a waste of talant to me. i will stick to odley. and that dope single, he did on that soundtrack."
3,um i like alternative and depressing music MOODY MUSIC,"i'm really really desperately hungry, i'm getting dizzy now from starvation."
3,what a missed opportunity,"Beck has managed to create a CD that doesn't live up to whatever expectations I had when I purchased it. This is a dismal follow up to his three previous masterpieces. If it wasn't for tracks 7-11 this would be a waste of money. Tracks 1-6 are fair at best. Oh well, you can't be a genious all the time. The hidden ""track"" is a total waste. Beck is better when he combines folk music with hip-hop beats. Also where's the rock guitar? No good rockin' guitar. Track #4 is stupid. What a miss (as opposed to a hit). I give it 3 stars for the 5 decent songs on this CD. The rest are either boring or bad. Sorry Beck, but I have to be honest. Here's hoping the next one rocks."
1,I really hate this album,"I think Beck's ""Mutations"" and ""Odelay"" are brilliant albums. ""Midnite Vultures"" is too much of a departure for me, so much so, that I can't even listen to this album. It's really bad. I'm no fan of motown, so I suppose that's why I don't connect with this music. Listening to Beck sing in funky falsetto voice is really painful."
2,Terrible,"I like Beck...a lot. Loved mellow gold, mutations, sea change, guero (showing that I'm cool with his experimenting). This album is just not good. I don't like a single track on the album. It sounds cheap and arranged at the last minute."
1,A Complete Load of Bollocks,I think this album must be Beck's retaliation against his record company for releasing Mutations on their label against his wishes. It's awful.
3,Dissapointing,"My boyfriend plopped this CD in my hands, saying that it was really good. On the first listen, I was impressed by Sexx Laws and Mixed Bizness. These two songs were intelligently written and clever, but the rest of the CD was terrible. I was bored, waiting for it to end. Being the lover of music that I am, I gave the CD three more listens, hoping that the songs would grow on me. Unfortunately, this album ceased to keep my interest"
2,review by me,"This is not a bad cd in my opinion. I gave it a 2 star rating because it didn't apeal to me. I feel that this cd would be better off being the the r/b or rap genre. I prefur rock, or alternative, so i don't like it, but if u like folk/rap, go for it."
3,"ok, but don't get too excited!","midnite vultures it is not one of the best Beck's albums. for example odelay haves this unique print also mutations and mellow gold, but midnite vultures doesn't have it....im not saying that this is a bad album but it is not what i expected. songs like""mixed biznezz"",""sexxx laws"",""milk and honey"" and ""nicotine and gravy"" make this record a great buy."
5,Beck is Back to rock!,"This is one of the best CD i ever bought. at first i thought it was a little boring, but listen to the second time i found myself dancing with it. It is the power of Beck. The best songs are Sexxy law and hollywood freaks. i enjoy the cd alot more then any other. there wasn't any rap/rock song like Novacane or where's it at, but the whole CD is still beck's best. I don't think i will ever take it out of my CD player!"
5,"Very good, but a bit short","Except for track #5 (which is good in its own right, it just doesnt fit the rest of the CD), this is a superbly produced album, easily matching Mellow Gold in excellence. ""Sexx Laws"", ""Peaches & Cream"", ""Get Real Paid"", and ""Out Of Control"" are probably the most notable tracks.The big problem with this CD is that it feels way too short (even though it is over 50 minutes)... the songs are great but you just wish they wouldn't stop.Overall, this CD is well worth the buy. It is not perfect, but well worth your money."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I bought this album based on the fact that Beck's last two albums were great. Midnite Vultures has a few good songs, but much of it is pretty cheesy. It's a fun cd to listen to, just don't expect a masterpiece."
4,Party vibe - instant fun,"Beck's best at his hippest, funkiest, top. Put this CD in your player and a party is virtually bound to start. Unlike almost any other pop artist Beck oozes talent and imagination. He shrugs off convention and creates an amalgam of musical styles that always seem to fit just right. Each of Beck's new CD's always seem new and some fans of his earlier works might not like this new one but if you like any kind of dance or funk there's a whole lot of fun here. Mixed Bizness gets my vote for the best."
2,Not Equivalent,"Battery arrive quickliy and in good condition. However, the battery life is about 60% of Sony brand that came with the camera."
5,Super Long Life,"I've been TRYING to run the battery down so that the first charge will be from a depleted battery, but this baby holds a charge like no other battery I've seen."
3,Not a Bad toy but be patient,I bought this for my son's 4th birthday three weeks ago. It is a cool idea but you have to hold the launcher at just the right spot to correctly launch the car into the loop. My mom and I tried to do it for awhile with no sucess. It would not launch the car into the loop. My son being Mr. I can do it.. tried to no avail.. He finally got frustrated and quit.. However my 6 year olds nephew did it 8 out of 10 attempts. And tld me maybe it's luck... I have to agree I haven't seen my son play with it since. Everytime I suggest it to end his boredom he says I can't do that.It's allright but if your not 'lucky' be patient.
5,Foam magnet letter,Great product. Magnet is the size of the whole letter so no chance of swallowing small pieces.
4,Bill's Big Book of Amplifiers,"The late Bill Orr, W6SAI, was a legend to many of us old timer hams. His books were always practical and helpful. Radio Handbook is no exception. This is a reprint of an older edition of Radio Handbook so its technology looks like 80's vintage. (Get the ARRL Handbook for recent stuff.) This book's strength is tube-type linear amplifiers. That's why I bought it and I'm happy with it. Very practical help and ideas. His general radio theory sections are quite clear as well. For other circuits and devices, I found the material rather dated. But for amps, it's my book!"
2,It's not THAT good,"The author gives too much emphasis in the power amplification, with very good circuits, but it is very shallow in the modulation/detection part."
1,Lighting So Bad Can't Watch Most of the Movie,"This may have been a borderline-watchable B (or C or really D) horror movie, but the lighting was so bad, it was nearly impossible to to tell what was happening. Everything was so dark that even after setting the TV to the brightest setting possible, you could still not make out most of what was going on. As the other reviewer said, not worth the $1.99--especially since it's virtually impossible to watch."
1,School project,"I appreciate Amazon providing a platform for movies like this to be seen, but they need to exercise discretion out of respect for their customers. At the very least, require a trailer for each film so the buyer knows what they are purchasing.This film isn't poorly done -- if it was done as a school project. Unfortunately, as much as I love film and support the arts, this is not something I want to pay to see. Not even a $1.99."
2,Biased,"This biography is serviceable however, it it clearly biased. The author loses all journalistic credibility when he partners with and becomes too personally involved with SV's mother. He sanitizes the truth, minimizes the facts and attempts to validate a mother's misguided memory of a troubled son. It is a chronicle of a mother, her love and a fan's need to connect with a part of his youth. For a more unbiased retelling of the era one should turn to ""England's Dreaming"" by Jon Savage. I also highly recommend the film ""The Filth and the Fury""."
3,the book is too tall,I thought the book would be less of a picture book and more of a bio. It wasn't bad but it wasn't what i expected it to be. Great pictures but i had to return it because the binding broke and many of the pages fell out. it might have been just my copy.
1,Terrible book about a horrible fight,"Look else where. As a prior service enlisted soldier who retired as an officer and majored in English in college, I found this book to be tepid,uninformative, and poorly written. Seriously not worth the time.Please note that General Fred Weyand whose obit was in the NY Times this week was quoted there saying in 1967 he knew that the fight in Vietnam was a lost cause and that,""Westy (GEN Westmoreland) just doesn't get it."""
5,Heroes all,"This book was fabulous, my brother was the FNG written about. It was the first I ever knew about his experiences in Vietnam and I knew he was wonderful, but I never imagined the experience he and the other soldiers had. For whatever reason, he never discussed his tour with us and after reading this book I know why. It is just so much to bear for so many, so young. They really were heroes. A must read for anyone interested in the Vietnam war."
5,Enjoyable LDS Suspenseful Romance,"I won a copy of this book from LDS Publisher. It didn't influence my review in any way. If you like LDS romance with suspense in it, this book is for you. The excitement starts on the first page and keeps you running. Julie creates believable characters that I came to love, and the villains are terrifyingly lifelike. Well written, fun read. Highly recommended."
4,Cranford EZY Climb Folding Rope Step,"The shipping was on time and the product was as advertised. I gave the steps a four star due to the length of the rope limits the size of tree you can climb. In addition, I was hoping to purchase enough of the rope steps to eliminate some of the climbing sticks used with my lone wolf lock-on. Four of the steps weigh as much as one of my sticks but it takes five steps to cover the distance that one stick covers. So , by the time I get enough steps to eliminate three sticks I would be carrying the same amount of weight and the sticks are much more stable to climb on. With that being said, I LIKE THE STEPS. Very easy to use, very quiet to set up. I will be using them at the top of my climb near the stand. If U hunt game and fish they also are a great alternative to screw in bow holder/gear hanger. Another good buy from Amazon."
3,"""For the Married Ones""","I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I was married. There were so many characters names mentioned, I totally got confused. I didn't understand why Raney and Charles would insult each other intentionally. I recommend this book to those who are married and also to those couples who have lots of misunderstandings."
3,Stereotypical characters but nonetheless amusing,"Being a liberal from the North, I kind of get the feeling that this book stereotypes conservative Christians from the South. Raney seems much too conservative for a 24-year old in the early 70's. It seems odd to think that she wouldn't know anything about the Episcopal church or vegetarians. Also, she is so close-minded about everything from sex to religion to food, that it seems hard to understand why Charles would choose a woman so opposite him for his wife. I also felt that some of the women were portrayed as absolute idiots - and almost everyone in Raney's family were bigots.Even with those thoughts, the book (I listened to it on tape) was enjoyable if a bit dated for the 90's."
3,"Light and fun, but, whatever","Light and fun, but wholly unfulfilling. At the end of the book, I put it down and went about my life. I didn't want more. I sorta wondered why everyone loves Clyde Edgerton so much."
1,Big Disappointment!,"After reading Edgerton's ""Walking Across Egypt,"" I was looking forward to another hilarious book. What a disappointment this book was! I was raised in the South, and as a Southerner, I found this book to be very offensive - from its portrayal of racial prejudice to the degradation of Raney's entire family. I got the feeling the author was trying to tell us that only people who are from the cities in the South (like Atlanta) are intelligent and progressive, or have a world view larger than their own back yard.I was surprised that the author used the ""n"" word in the book - even though it was supposed to be in a humorous manner of ""poor little girl who doesn't know any better.""If you want to read something by Edgerton, read ""Walking Across Egypt."" Let this one stay on the shelf."
2,YUCK,"I despise this book. I was forced to read the whole entire thing for school, unless I wanted to fail my English class. All you professional book critics, call it a ""fine piece of literature"" whatever you want, but I call it stupid."
3,"""N"" word is used","Has anyone noticed Raney uses the ""N"" word in the section beginning on page 116? That opens a whole can of worms. I live in the South and must say that Raney is a ""blabber-mouth!"" Raney needs to gain some self-control. She needs to face herself and think, which she obviously hasn't done. Is she funny? Yes, absolutely! I've laughed out loud! But is she over the line? Yes. Do I recommend this to everyone. No. The ""N"" word section is offensive and uncalled for."
4,Charming Voice,"I picked this up after watching the film version of Walking Across Egypt (which I loved!). This story does not quite live up to Walking Across Egypt - I found it charming just the same. The writing is so subtle - the images just sneak up on you. Yes, one just goes on with their life as another reader said - but feeling just a little bit better - a little more hopeful. That's why readers like Clyde Edgerton."
2,Read it for the Dialect Capturing,"While every characer in this book (including Raney and Charles) rubbed me the wrong way, Edgerton's beautiful use of local color and regional dialect in the end was his saving grace--because of that I remain a loyal fan to his work.I felt the book was disorganized and inconclusive in terms of character development and plot structure. The characters do not evolve throughout the story, although the issues that plague them are significant and deserve more attention than they are given.I hated the feeling that I was being left out to dangle in the end. I was unable to determine whether to feel happy for the couple, or angry at the fact they were still together without resolving any of their problems."
3,Interestingly insightful,"The relationship developed between the main characters, Raney and Charles was both interesting and insightful. At times, I couldn't help but feel sympathy for both characters due to the frustration created by their differences. I always find it interesting to experience a character whose inner workings are so different from my own. I think this book was well written and true to its historical setting."
5,CURL BOOSTER!,"Love this product! Bought direct from Ouidad and the claim is Boosts shapeless,lifeless curls. It really works and gives me additional volume for those days where the top of my head lays flat. Just remember: a little product goes a long way!"
1,Drying,This product did not make my hair curl up and it made it very dry. I honestly don't know who would benefit from this. My hair is wavy and it's supposed to be for wavy hair. I wouldn't use it unless your hair was very healthy. It is very drying.
5,Science is Fiction was amazing!,"Science is Fiction was amazing! If you like Painleve you'll like the book. It's filled with so many interesting essays, and I found the interview with Painleve to be particularly interesting and entertaining."
5,An exciting memoir.,"This journal builds memoirs easily and succintly. It has every memory jogger a journaling ""avoider"" would need to create a full, living memory of events for posterity. It's a creative, exciting exhibit for the coffee table, library, or office. An excellent publication!"
3,Not one of Ms. Macomber,"Travis Thompson need a wife to keep his nephews and niece. Mary Warner is shy Louisiana librarian who believes that she will never find love. But then Mary answers Travis ad for a wife and takes a chance of a lifetime.""Morning Comes Softly"" is an okay book by Debbie Macomber and unlike books by Ms. Macomber this book is not very good. This characters are flat and uniteresting. Readers may want to avoid this book."
3,Morning Comes Softly,"The author is a great writer, but I didn't enjoy this particular book. It's not really believable, and it's really kind of awkward at times."
5,Owllady,You must read this book. Its cute and funny. Debbie Macomber knows how to write very interesting books. Recommend this book.
4,Great Story!,Loved the story of 2 lost souls who find each other in unusual circumstances! Very warm and touching. I would recommend it.
3,"Very readable, but simple","A quick read, enjoyable. But lacking in the depth department... relationship flourished too easily, Mary was one-dimensional, Mary's Louisiana roots disappeared entirely when she got to the ranch. Nothing about the book wow'd me but it was enjoyable overall, and a short read."
3,an average book,"the book was not excellent , but you still want to read it until the end. The love between the main characters has a good development. I thought there was a lot of cute moments and the story also demontrate how hard it can be to continue to live your life after a tragedy. As for the writing, the author has a good style and i have nothing negative to say about it. If you are searching for a pleasant moment to relax, this book is the one."
3,good effort but could be much better,"I have always wondered how great it will be to mix Bob Marleys great melodies with good hip hop beats. ""Turn your lights down low"" is awesome. Other good tracks include ""rebel music"", ""Johnny Was"", and ""survivaL"". ""No more troubles"" and ""roots, rock, reggae can be tolerated. The other six tracts should not have made the cut. The remake of ""Jamming"" (one of Bob's great songs) is really terrible. While I emphatize with the Marley boys attempt to bring their Dad's music to inner city youths, I think they could have offered something much better - worthy of their illustrous father's name. The songs were much better with just Bob Marley singing with hip hop beats in the backgroud. I also agree with one reviewer that most of the artist paired with Bob is unimaginable. I hope that there will be a much better effort next time around because Bob's work has not yet been completed - sorry Stephen."
1,The originals are light years better,"I listened to this cd and one star is a comliment. This pathetic remix amounts to nothing less than musical necrophelia; taking the work of a great but dead artist and over-dubbing / remixing that work with flavor of the month ""artists"". This same kind of defilement occured when elevator musician Kenny G overdubbed on the great Louis Armstrong's music. Marley's great music/message should not be defiled by marginally talented artists; most of whom represent the exact opposite of what Bob Marley stood and fought for. But Hey, Bob Marley is no longer with us to make the musical decisions, so let's just go ahead and remix his music as we please and make some quick bucks. Skip this cd and buy the original recordings because they are light years better. I recomend Survival as the greatest Bob Marley cd and after that Kaya. Peace."
2,Forgotten Order,"They forgot my order, I had to shoot them an e-mail. The guy apologized, and my order was quickly sent after that. Ordered on July 23, recieved August 22. Luckily, Bob Marley is worth waiting a year for."
1,Pathetic,"After having listened to this album where legendary Bob's music and voice is artificially mixed with some other artists' poor interpretations, I even start doubting if this record is meant as a tribute... An irrelevant, useless album!"
3,Not what i had anticipated!,"I listened to this cd and i only liked three songs including of course ""turn your lights down low"".............i did not feel bob marley's music coming through these renditions. However it was different and of course praises go the Tuff Gong crew for the effort.........don't stray away too much from your fathers initial soulful tunes.Waiting to hear music from Steve, Ziggy and the rest of the Marley children! one love"
5,Bob Marley: Chant Down Babylon,"I am a die hard Marley fan, and I am very pleased with this CD and every CD I have of Marley."
1,Not what Bob would have done,"Bob Marley was never one to do covers or collaborate with many guests. Busta Rhymes and the FlipMode Squad go against the ideals that Bob respected. I'm a fan of hip hop, im a fan of bob marley, but i dislike the both of them together. Burnin' and lootin is probably the best song, that or Turn your Lights down Low. I just did not like it, i dont think Bob would have collaborated with these people, or at least most of them."
2,ment to explore,this album was ment to explore bob's music in to hiphop and R&B lovers rather than his roots reggae fans that on it self is not so bad but did they really had to wake him out of his sleep couldn't they left those great classics alone from all bob's albums i've never heard a duet if bob where still alive he wouldn't work with most of the artist here he won't even no who they are i heard bob once saying in an interview i don't listen to the radio. bob would stick with his own music. there are so many albums of this great legend that for real fans this is a waste of time and they probarly right bob would never be named with persons except for the very talented Hill and Baydu who have criminal relationships or blow each other to pieces if they really understand bob or his music it wouldn't had to come this far bob rebelt against the soldiers of babylon and that are the people responsible for this album.
4,JAMMIN,I loved this CD. I think that even though some of the rappers do normaly make violent music. Bob Marleys Spirit shined through so bright that it doesn't matter what the other performers do. This Rocks. We Love you Bob!
5,Great Tribute to Bob Marley,"This is an excellent compilation of Marley's greatest hits that brings together the creative talents of some fantastic music artists. I was never a big Reggae fan until I heard this CD. This CD has been added to my all-time favorites of my music collection. A must have if you are a fan of the late great Bob Marley, or Reggae music."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"If you like hip-hop and rock, buy this one. If you like his old time music buy Legend or his other remasters. I own this and I don't like it one bit. There are so many remixes on this cd, ..."
2,"Good, but not the Bob vision","There is a lot of good stuff on this CD, and it is enjoyable to listen too. However, the re-make artists' vision and the Bob vision clash horribly. Bob had a completely different approach to fighting for rights and equality than these re-make artists do, and I find it very disrespectful to Bob and his life to twist his songs in this manner. As I said, there is some good musical stuff here, but I find it unpleasant to listen to because it's not right to do something like that to Bob's vision. His songs were masterpieces in themeselves, and they deserve to be appreciated in their original beauty."
3,"Good, but get some facts straight","The idea of this project was smart, however, it was not done with any kind of respect for bob's work. Bob Marley was not only an execellent vocalist, but he could play the guitar very well. Stephan Marley knocked off the intrumental tracks on these and replaced them with a more ""urban"" feel. Also, on the track Jammin with Mc Lyte, Ms. Lyte makes a reference to Allah, to my knowledge, Bob Marley was a rastifarian"
1,Poor remixes of good songs,"The problem with this tribute is that all the original songs were much better than these re-recorded versions. The artists on this album simply added a drum machine and rap samples to the recordings. And for the critic below me- the original ""Roots Rock Reggae"" is a fabulous song, Bob Marley said reggae is the ""king's music."" The critic below me couldn't possibly tell me that the original Bob Marley recording of Roots Rock Reggae was any more insipid than any song on Chant Down Babylon. Re-interpret Bob Marley's music as much as you want, but you are not going to get anywhere with a drum machine and rapping skills. I am fine with interpretation, but don't defend the remixes."
2,It is NOT Shuen paper,"It is the cheapest practice paper made from straws. It has nothing to do with ""Shuen"". It is only for the very beginners."
1,Stay away from this product!,"This is a cheaply-made product. Its photograph in the Amazon website does not reflect its actual, and very poor, quality. It has a flimsy bottom so it does not conduct heat efficiently; thin sides; and a top handle that will burn your fingers after a few minutes on the fire."
1,Not pleased,"After first time use and washing the pan, black specs were found at the bottom of the pan. I was highly upset about this. It looked like it was a 50 year old pan. All I did was cook some rice.Kinetic Classicor Stainless-Steel 3-Quart Saucepan with Lid"
1,A disappointment,"Don't be fooled....This disc sounds NOWHERE NEAR as good as the Live at the Fillmore '68 double disc set - sounds like someone used a muffled cassette recorder, AFTER they had driven over it.Too bad, because some of the cuts are good in spite of this (and would have been great on a better recording).There are fade-outs and fade-ins; one cut is barely 1+1/2 minutes long; the voices are sometimes very faint; and the sound on much of the disc is alternately muffled and struggling with its ?swishing? quality.Might have given 1/2, zero, or negative stars if it were possible.Sure sounds like a bootleg-type recording."
5,BEKI BE WITH ME,"THIS IS THE BEST COMPILED COLLECTION OF SINGLES FROM THE 7""S AND E.P.'S VICE SQUAD PUT OUT. THE NEWER RELEASES DON'T COME EVEN CLOSE TO THESE CLASSICS."
4,"A Good Read, but Very Light...","I was quite happy to come across a book that was devoted specifically to Pagan Gods, on both the front of a book taking a Pagan angle, and one focusing on Gods instead of Goddesses (a book subject in somewhat short supply).That said, the book is exactly what it claims to be: a begginners guide. THere is good information in here about Thoth, the Oak and Holly Kings, the Green Man, the Horned God, and so forth, but given the books size, it was all very quickly imparted, and as such left me with the feeling that I'd delved only a little, not reaching any real depth.Still, that said, there is a great beginning in this book. Were the Mooreys to put out another, in depth title with a similar topic, I would not hesitate to go buy it. If you are just beginning in Paganism or Wicca, and want to get yourself a firmer grasp on the basics of the Gods, grab this book and settle down for a great introductory read."
1,a yawn fest,How BORING this book is!!One of the twins boring friends at school ends up with a stepsister and..well I could barely stand to make my way through this book..it was like counting blades of grass which would probably be more interesting come to think of it.
4,very thought provoking,"read this book a few years ago when i was on an atlantis kick, and i never came across so many strange theories in my life. the book was interesting, no doubt about it. he covers topics from atlantis, serpent people from the Orion constellation, the subterranean civilization of the earth and its king, the planet known as maldek (or phaeton) that occupied the space between mars and jupiter and how/why it blew up, and some other planet called Ragnorak."
3,"Guide, Not Grounded Enough","It is just surprising when it comes to video games and their strategy guides. They always seem to falter when they aren't specific enough. For the Versus Books company, they have the right idea when it comes to value for consumers, but not enough when helping people with the games. Anyway, that was the case with the strategy guide for Super Mario Sunshine. Although the game guide has enough real sides to it, but not enough for people to really understand anyway. The guide is good, but it is a little bit complicated to understand, when you have a hard time trying to find certain coins, and aspects of characters including Bosses and features. I think that it is just a shame. Although many people don't sell the guides anymore for this game anymore, if you can find a better guide, say from Nintendo directly, get it from Nintendo. Otherwise, this strategy guide will just have to do, but it will make it tougher for you to know how to beat Super Mario Sunshine."
1,"electronics nut from Aurora, ILL.","reception on vhf is very poor. unf reception is excellent. unit does have tv mts sound pickup which sounds great!! one large problem is unit uses 4 inch lcd screen placed behind a 3.25"" non-removable black front trimplate. trimplate screen is old fashioned round window (see picture on web site)which cuts your viewing off on all sides and corners of the 4"" lcd picture. unit is really 3.25"" not 4"" viewing screen. cable tuning is not available. operates on 6 'c' batteries or ac. sound is the best on any lcd tv i have ever heard!! stereo headphone jack input is available. If plugging in ext antenna, picture is ok on vhf. also color, tint, or contact controls are not adjustable. color was ok but tint was very slightly on the green side. brightness is adjustable. nice audio touch, cable tuning needed. returning item to amazon for refund."
2,don't let it get hot....,"this little t.v. was not what i needed here in arizona. I bought it so i could take it to the baseball game and watch college football. It wouldn't work after traveling in the car on the way to the game in a backpack. It just got too hot. I carried it from the car to the game in my iced water bag to cool it down. It worked after that, but i had to leave it turned on or it wouldn't have turned back on. Was going to send it back, but didn't want to pay for shipping. Just waiting for the few months here in arizona so i can use it outside."
3,Electronicsman,"The Action portable LCD TV: Model ACN-5402I owned one of these TVs back in 2005 when TV signals were not digital; and antenna worked best on UHF. VHF reception in 2005 was rather poor. It was my first LCD TV, and it was neat. This cute little fold-up color TV has two built-in stereo speakers, Audio/video input jacks let you connect a DVD player or cable/satellite service to it. (You will not be able to use its built in antenna, since the digital conversion of TV signals.)Tuner is not digital; but you could watch off-the-air TV with and antenna and a converter box. You could also hook up video games to TV and a camcorder. TV comes with AC adapter, car adapter, or use on 6 ""C"" batteries.Be carefull exposing this TV to excessive outdoor heat, it might shut off. You can adjust TV screen angle for best viewing, and you will need to since this TV is early LCD technology.ACTION ACN5402APlease note: I do not know how to add voting buttons to reviews."
1,Pathectic Tuning,"This thing cannot tune at all. I live within 5 miles of the broadcast towers of Buffalo, New York, and I can tune in just ONE (1-not a typo) station. It seem to love this station so much that no matter what you set the tuner for, it chooses that station. The sound is just as bad; the station I get has sound, but is garbled behind reason. DO NOT BUY THIS. IT IS A WASTE OF 30 BUCKS"
1,Terrible Customer Service,"The flashlight body is fine, but the reflector lost its silver coating after less than one hour use. This is the second Maglite that's done this. Maglite customer service said they won't replace it under warranty. They want to sell me one. Come on! It's a $12 part that costs $15 to ship. I hate to see a good company destroying itself by failing to address a serious materials problem."
3,This action figure isnt so cool,this is roseys new figure his ponytail fell off the first day i got it it isnt so good you cant see his eyes because he has a removeable mask i dont recommend you to buy this figure if you like rosey alot then get the figure.
5,interesting characters,"I'm so glad to purchase this DVD. It helped make this long cold winter bearable. With so few good shows on, I used these to watch and make the evenings bearable. I'm waiting for the DVD of the second season to be offered. I hope the show is not cancelled for the third season."
1,A Lack-Luster version of 24,This show should be on USA network with things like Burn Notice. The acting is bad and the action is over-the-top. The characters are flat and there is no sign that the writing will ever add life to them. If you like brainless paper thin plots with no central story you might like this show. I honestly don't see it lasting more than a season.
1,don't like it,"I watched the first two episodes and I gave up. It is just another spy show with the same old same old formula. Something happens. Let's do something about it. Couple punches later. Good guy wins. Bad guy loses. The end.On the bright side, FOX now has The Good Guys on Monday. I like The Good Guys much better than Human Target."
2,"Love show, hated this episode","I still love, love love this show but I didn't like the girl they were hired to save. I don't like people who think that someone owes them something. Her whole reason for living was to be her father's alter ego but after that what's left. Don't save people like that because they are not likeable and they only bring down the show. But, I forgive you. Now lets move on to bigger and better things."
4,Targeted,"This is a good popcorn show.There's nothing particularly deep or resonant about it, but it's well-structured, the characters are likable, the acting is good, and the pacing is solid. And the humor is nicely constructed as well, not the typical brainless, formulaic work we're all accustomed to.Smart show. And fun..."
3,Not the best - but a good concept,"This show is not so great, in my opinion.It has a interesting idea (a James Bond alike that solves problems for other people, and speaks Japanese, Russian, everything, besides being skilled in martial arts, guns, everything)The season is slow to take off and, other than the big budget obviously invested in the episodes, there is no great thrill. It's just another ""hit the bad guy"" series. However, producers intelligently tried to add character development into the series, and it worked well.All in all, for such a short season, it is good entertainment. Mark Valley's skills are much beterr used here than in Boston Legal and in the awful soap operas he starred in the past."
4,Human target,Want to get season 2 but currently unavailable. Please let me know when it will be available. Season 1 without season 2 diminishes rating.
4,Good new show,"This show seems to be off to a great start. It has the right mix of comedy and action which makes for a great way to spend an hour. On top of all that, it is nice to see Jackie Earle Haley in this show. He really adds to anything that he is in."
5,Good Series,"If you like like action, you should like this series. It reminds me of the Die Hard movies. Characters you really like and a lot of dry humor along with the action. I can't wait until until season II is released."
3,Not what I expected....,"I watched this movie directly after seeing ""Mrs. Miniver"" on Turner Classics, and expected something along the same lines, however I was a bit disappointed in the defeatest tone of the movie, and the fact that there was no accounting (unless I missed it somehow) of the absence of the oldest son Vin...also, Judy aged quite fast in this sequel! I was unhappy about the ending, and couldn't understand why we couldn't just have Greer and Walter dance off into the sunset...still, if/when it is available on DVD I will buy it."
2,The Minivers Go To Pot,"After the staggering success of the original Mrs. Miniver, a simple but profoundly moving story of home life in a small English village during World War II, M.G.M. Studios reunited the cast for yet another look into the lives of this most English of English families.Unfortunately, it seems that the entire Miniver family went completely to pot, if not to hell in a handbasket, in the interim. Given an eight-rate script which focuses on a mawkish love triangle, even the actors seem slightly embarrassed, and the Miniver family rapidly descends into tedious soap opera. Unlike the the original film, they are no longer people we can admire or a family we particularly want to know. Two stars only, one for the efforts of a talented cast, one for the usual excellent M.G.M. production values."
4,Great book if you already know a little immunology,"It is the second time around that I am reading Janis Kuby's Immunology. The first time was as a grad student and then I had to actually learn it all. Now as a scientist I am re-reading it to remind myself of forgotten wisdoms. I must admit that the second reading is much more fun. Firstly because I don't really have to remember all the particulars and secondly because the chronological order of the experiments gives great insight into the history of immunology as a discipline.I realize that this is probably not what grad students are looking for, but I find it a very interesting (re)read."
5,Immunology Fifth Edition is the best one.,"This book is a great introduction to the ever changing fiel of immunology. The book has excellent illustrations and the order of the content is very logic, that's explains why the book is easy to understand."
2,book,"The book was described as a new book on the list, but I received a used one with many places highlighted or marked with a ball pen. In general, the service was very good."
5,I ARREST YOU IN THE NAME OF THE QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I haven't even seen this set and am primed to get it!! A great afternoon adventure series from the '50s finally comes to DVD!! There have been some cheap single episode DVDs circulating with questionable video/audio quality. If this set compares well with the Superman sets, it will definitely be worth the purchase. NOW!! When will the Rin Tin Tin series be released? (YOOO RINNYY!!!)"
1,NO Stars,"The package arrived in poor shape and the contents were crushed and unplayable. Consequently, I can not review the content of the DVDs that were ordered. Season 2, which I own is great and IN COLOR which is unusual for the 1950's. If you can find series one, I can recommend it."
2,The Tank is cooler than the terrain,"This playset includes small sort of snap together peices of terrain with flimsy soft plastic attachments. Nothing stays together very well, but my kids liked playing with the tank."
5,Finally!,"A song that's strong in meaning. I can't wait for a complete album. Good Job Jsoule Tyrell, looks like I'm about to be a big fan of yours....keep it up."
5,"Something a ""Nutter"" Can't Live Without!","These drumsticks are just what I have been looking for since my first Stagg pair have started showing more advanced signs of wear. And, of course, being a huge fan of Stewart Copeland I simply couldn't go with any other pair than the one he endorses.The sticks are excellent in quality and ""just feel right"", so to speak. They definitely make a difference in sound, partially due to general design, partially due to difference in weight compared to the last pair I used.Looking forward to some excellent jam sessions with these sticks!"
5,Run for Coffee Run!,"Michael Legge is one of the few comedic geniuses in the world of micro budget cinema. In his latest endeavor he uses the simplest of plot devices to give us a greatest hits movie. Chris Qualm has agoraphobia and refuses to go outside. He figures that it's safer and the world is crazy and has nothing to offer. Then he undergoes a new form of therapy and decides it's time to make...a coffee run.Unfortunately, he was right all along as he is plunged into a world of androids, secret agents, Venusians and much, much more.Coffee Run works as both an individual film and a film for his numerous fans. There are characters from many of his films mashed together into one plot for our enjoyment. It's like Kevin Smith's Askewniverse only it's good.Just beware that once you get Coffee Run it will send you down the slippery slope of getting all of his movies.You have been warned!Enjoy!"
3,"Poor quality,","The picture is not very accurate, and the material is poor quality plastic, so easy to rip, it was packaged with big staples hard to remove. My husband keep them just to make me feel good."
2,Consider All Sources,"I read Kubler-Ross, and many other death and dying experts in the 70s after my mom died in her late 40s; I've had a living will since I was able to find one, updating it every few years and having my last wishes conversation with family as well as my internist. Despite its glowing reviews, this video is very much a beginner's guide and offers very little new to me and nothing cutting edge--despite its touching moments I consider this purchase an expensive mistake on my part.(I purchased this DVD from Amazon in October 2012.)"
4,a must see for intergenerational family members,"I highly recommend that families from 2 or even 3 generations come together to view Consider the Conversation: a Documentary on a Taboo Subject. We viewed it as a group of board members who work to support hospice care at the end of life. It challenged each of us to borrow the copy and set a time to view with our nuclear families ,"
4,Useful Tool,This is an engaging presentation which would be most useful in a group. I will use it in end of life planning groups to begin the discussion. Prbably not as valuable for personal use.
4,Why should it be taboo?,"We're all headed for for some kind of ending. Would you start out on a trip without letting the people you love know where you are going? Fortunately, there is a growing interest in exploring our wishes for the end of our life. I for one don't want to spend it staring at the ceiling of an ICU."
5,"Wonderful, pertinent film","As a nurse as well as the daughter of an aging, yet still healthy, mother, this film is exactly what we need. She was the one who asked if I could get the film - proof that having the conversation is a priority for her. You'd think I was trained to know that, but apparently not - and I'm not alone in the health care profession unfortunately. The pearls of wisdom offered throughout the film, both from professionals and patients, hit home for me. It asks the question, ""how can we best care for you?"" which made me realize I need to ask the question more often in my work and, most importantly, I need to ask it of my mother. I owe that to her - we owe it to each other - as the most basic way of honoring, respecting and loving each other as we near the end of our lives. Beautiful film on a very relevant topic!"
1,Liers,"pricing was false advertisement , and refused to offer me a second chance deal. very bad seller"
2,sad!,"Thank goodness the names were changed to protect...the innocent? Probably not....but I'm sure they are glad their names were changed! I know this is supposed to be fiction, but was told it was also based on some real events that happened in a small Texas towns....even fiction should not be written this outrageous! I guess everyone remembers details in their own way! I have to say, it was entertaining trying to figure out who each character was supposed in real life!"
4,Great repair manual for the sporty!,"As a Harley Davidson mechanic I was impressed with Clymer's Evo Sportster Repair Manual.There is a wealth of information in this book for the do-it your-selfer.Not as complete as a factory manual but the average person won't ever miss the oem manual.I recomend it,crankpin74."
1,Do Not Buy This,"Do not buy this album just because you are a fan of pink's. Pink does NOT sing on it. The people singing on it are unknown bands who want to be heard. The Rolling Stone article states: ""For a few dollars less than the real thing, buyers can get renditions of their favorite music recreated by unknown musicians, DJs, and even string quartets. For some labels, it's a quick cash-in.""I have listened to samples, and they aren't very good. So please do not buy this just because it's labeled PINK."
5,Wall Mirrow,"This is a well made mirror. It's heavy and it's excellent for seeing things without my glasses on. I'm 51 years old and it was getting where I had to use cheaters with my 7X mirror. I kept thinking that there should be a stronger mirror on the market and then I found this 10X and purchased it. I am thrilled with my purchase. It's not only well made, it looks good too. :)"
2,Lighted Mirror,"magnification side of this mirror is distorted and hard to view. If you can stay centered in the reflection you can make out the image reflected but any movement from side to side distorts the relection. Light is good, extention arm is good and connect is good. Non-maginfied side is great."
1,Shattered Mirror,"I was so very disappointed to received the dream mirror I had looked for everywhere. I paid extra for shipping due to the fact it was for my birthday. When I opened the package, I pulled the mirror out and pieces of glass landed on my lap. At the first glance the main mirror appeared to be in perfect condition. When I examined the back mirror it was completely missing off of the mirror frame. I examined the box and found broken glass and a round shattered mirror that was covered with a protective seal. I was so disapointed. I think it is best that I not order mirrors on the internet."
3,Dead Ends is a one way street,"Before I begin my review, a quick question: Can anyone honestly tell the difference between tracks 1 & 2? I sure can't. They both have essentially the same beat and attitude and tune. But people have been saying that about punk rock since the beginning, so I guess I shouldn't be complaining about that. The only problem is that for the entire album, every song is almost indistinguishable from the one before it and the one after it. It almost seems like a half-hour long song. It's not a bad song, but it makes you wish for a little variety. As it is, it's just the same over and over - a NOFX-lite beat with simple, non-threatening emo lyrics. It's not original, but it's alright. Just ignore the Backstreet Boys cover at the end. Punkifying BSB might seem like a funny idea, but this cover owes more to the original than it does to parody. Not a good sign..."
4,Great,"A good cd with a few cover songs, like ""I want it that way"". This cd is a little bit harder Pop-Punk, than what Drive-Thru records seems to be. I gave it 4 stars because the songs get old after a while. But if you like Allister you should get it, [...]"
2,I wish it was worth more than two stars,"I really hope this band gets better in the future...they have talent, they just don't use it. You'll find yourself saying ""Wow, this is just like the last song"" Repeating the first verse and chorus two times can get pretty old....fast. Two good songs: ""Moper"" and ""Miz"". Stick to bands like Homegrown and The Ataris."
3,Not bad typical Emo-pop punk...,"Album has some high points and some catchy tunes. I really wanted to like this more than I actually did. And it's certainly not a bad album. But really, it's nothing that bands like Millencolin, Fenix TX, and the Ataris haven't already done (and somewhat better, I might add.). To sum it up, what does it say that the best song on the album is a Backstreet Boys remake? Probably not a whole lot good..."
4,Works like it should,"First thing your going to notice is the size of this thing-pretty big for small hands. The adjustable air pressure valve is a plus. The trigger feels like its going to stick or break off-it hasn't so far-so I can't really comment on reliability. The price is right-you're getting a Stanley product for the price of a no name. So far satisfied with its functionality but if it wasn't for the grip size and the ,potentially, sticky trigger I would give it 5 stars."
3,Cute little dish,"This little server is small but quite cute. The server blade seems not to fit on the item like I hoped, but I see the item as being useful and looking good on the table."
2,It's No Louis Clark & the Royal Philharmonic... But it's ok,"Back in 81 when I got the original Hooked on Classics record as a gift (which I still have), I discovered the beauty and power of classical music in a different way. Now, classical music makes up 1/3 of my music library because of that compilation of classics (thanks to Louis Clark and the Royal Philharmonic).So would I say this volume 4 has the same effect? I'd answer no, but I did like tracks 2 & 7."
2,No So Great,Once again another pathetic attempt at recreating what Louis Clark did with the original Hooked on the Classics. He succeeded by getting many of us hooked to the classics...something this album probably can't and won't do.
5,Great movie!,"Two great French actors - Jean Gabin and Jean-Paul Belmondo - brought together in a B&W movie that combines emotion, nostalgia, action in the context of the post WWII. Fantastic script, impactful performances, powerful dialogues, great character development. To be watched absolutely, even by English-speaking people who love art."
4,Quite watchable.,"Translated as 'A monkey in winter', this film sees Jean Gabin continuing his dour personna as a hotelier, who recognises in a drunken hotel guest an early version of himself.There then follow several drunken escapades, before both return to their normal, sober lifestyles.It's quite watchable, if not exactly exciting. But, viewer, be warned: my VHS copy has a very poor quality picture - either that, or the film was deliberately shot in half-light. Also, the entire film is compressed for the TV screen, so you actually only get around 60% size."
2,Seems a little on the dark side,"I appreciate the difference in his work, but it's not an uplifting album, has some depressing sounds."
2,Cheesey styrofoam,"I ordered the kit so my kids could experience some of the rocketry fun I had when I was a kid. Unfortunately this rocket is so flimsy that on of the tail segments broke off as soon as the plastic was removed. I repaired the styrofoam tail and we went off to launch. Before we could get it off the ground the other tail section broke off at the same place the first one did. I think there must be a stress areas in that portion of the tail to have both break at the same spot, but again I repaired the tail and launched. It was a very lack luster flight. When we got home it was shelved for future garage sales. At least the launch pad was acceptable. I'll buy other rockets and use the pad."
4,wagon train,"Yes, I must say it was like watching my favorite show back in the 60's again! I do not have any complaints! The only thing I wished they had done was provide more shows with Ward Bond, but they said they couldn't I guess because they were too old or couldn't be restored for viewing? Anyhow, I highly recommend wagon train!"
3,wagon train,"Love the Wagon Train dvd's we bought, beautifully boxed, unfortunately won't play on our dvd although it's fairly new, plays on the PS2 and computor though..well worth the money spent.Arrived within 21 days, have already ordered more."
3,Wonderful TV series! Pitiful packaging!,"My husband and I absolutely love the Wagon Train series. The number of episodes in the package is great. (but truthfully, for the price there SHOULD be a lot of episodes.) We like the newer ones and the older ones. The biggest problem we have had with the product is the packaging. You can barely get the dvds out of the holders. You practically tear them up getting them out. I am putting all of them in separate paper holders and then in a different box, so I don't struggle with not bending or breaking them everytime I try to take them out of the package. Did anyone else out there have this problem? Amazon needs to request that this company repackage them correctly, especially for the price they are asking for them, which I think is now about $70."
5,Great Western/Great Value,"At the new sales price this is a great value for an excellent western series. All the extended 90 minute color episodes from the '63 season plus 16 classic black & white episodes from prior seasons. The DVD picture and sound quality is good. It's a real pleasure to watch the fine acting, excellent guest stars, and innovative plots from TV's golden years."
2,"Wagons, Ho","What I really wanted was the Wagon Train episodes from start to finish. This is not what I got. The DVDs start somewhere with the color episodes. At the end are some of the earlier ones, but apparently not in any particular order. I remembered this being a really good show. Now the episodes seem somewhat silly."
3,BEWARE!! Set has been reissued in 2012 at a much cheaper price,"I just purchased ""Wagon Train-The Complete Season Seven"" at Walmart earlier today for $19.96. It contains the same 32 color episodes as ""The Complete Color Season"" and the interviews, but minus the black and white bonus episodes. The other difference is that it is now an 8-disc set with 4 episodes per disc. These are the complete 90 minute episodes though. Copyright on the DVD set is 2012 by Timeless Media.Notes on back of the set indicate that these 32 color episodes from the 7th season are fully restored from the original NBC Universal masters. The colors still seem a little faded with a little grain, but quite good.So, if you want to look to save a lot of money, check for the new 2012 reissued set."
4,Cute if the right light,"I do like this ring, but when I received it I thought they had sent a green one by mistake, unless you turn the balls where you can see the differnt colors you see green (a pretty shade of green). Still think it's cute though."
1,Cheap plastic frisbee,This frisbee should not be marketed for dogs. It's made out of cheap plastic which very easily becomes punctured when a dog catches it in their mouth. It's full of teeth holes after just a few throws. Waste of money. I'll stick to the 'Easy Glider' and the Kong rubber frisbees.
4,"The serious guide to spring, lever, and muscle projectile weapons","This is not a simple 'how-to', this is graduate level discussion of all manner of implements for launching projectiles without combustion. In short, a priceless resource for the engineering of these implements, but rather daunting for someone without a technical background.With patience and care, it can be a rewarding book for anyone interesting in things like catapults and crossbows, and has some great ideas for the do-it-yourselfers out their.E.M. Van Court"
4,Gorgeous yet not the same...,"I am a huge fan of Hell Girl and it's ethereal and scary soundtrack. However, the versions on this cd are not the same mixes and or cuts as you hear on a lot of the anime episodes. I was a bit disappointed to hear different versions of some of the songs or music from the animated series but still relatively happy as they are still gorgeous..."
4,Salt,"These poems really touched me in that way that makes me wish I had written them myself - but glad that she did because I could never do them the same service. Salt is such a great motif in this collection. Salt like the way women sweat. Like that taste, sometimes pleasant sometimes painful of it on your lips. I ordered another copy. There's a man I'm seeing that needs to read this book."
5,Salt is superb,"Ashley's first collection is a must-read for anyone interested in contemporary American poetry. Her sight is unusual and strong; in these poems exist humor, landscape, monologue, strong and compelling narrative, a touch of the metaphysic, an attentive compassion and care, a tenderness as well as a brutality, enticing musics, the lyric, an eye toward the sublime. The poems are varied and yet compelling as a group, well-rendered and taut. Ashley's voice is powerful and distinct. Read Salt."
4,Good..but could be improved upon,THis is a great book for working on independence...yet i feel that it is missing something that some of the other classics have. I can't put my finger on it...but it just lacks the desire to jump in and play (like on complete modern drumset). Otherwise not a bad book. Didn't care for the play-a-long tracks as much as other books...Tommy Igoe's Groove Essentials has some really awesome play along tracks that are far superior in my opinion
3,Some good news - some bad news,"I gave this book three stars because I was able to use only 3/5 of it. The first 3/5 of the book is composed of a series of tutorials on using VisualAge to develop GUIs. The remainder of the book is devoted to other Java areas such as DB access and server side topics. I was unable to do the DataBase chapter because DB2 Personal Edtion, included with the book, came without a use license. The chapters on team development, Servlets, JSPs and Enterprise Beans work only with the Enterprise edition of VisualAge which is not supplied with the book. If you want to understand the basics of VisualAge for Java this book is a good deal. For about $40 you get VisualAge Professional Edition and an excellent series of tutorials aimed at using VisualAge for GUI development. However, if you are interested in DB topics, Servlets, JSPs, Team Development or Enterprise JavaBeans, and you do not have the Enterprise edition of VisualAge, this book would be virtually useless."
2,Don't by this book to get certify on VisualAge for Java,"A so-so book, not good if you are planning to pass the IBM VisualAge for Java, Professional Edition V3 exam, it contains hard to follow examples and help next to nothing for the real test.To certify with the IBM exam consider reading the PDF files available with the product or online which contains at least a 90% of all the questions."
2,A few Comments,"I would have given the books higher marks, the first 8 chapters actually do help, and provide alot of information about Java Bean development, with helpful examples.However after chapter 8, it almost seems as if there is a differnet author, the examples do not match the screen shots, the screen shots are haphazard and incomplete, and there are missing steps.Even the included examples do not work (after chapter 8)So, save your money..dont buy the book"
3,Good to learn about Visual Programming but little else.,"This is a so-so book, very good for learning Visual Programming and GUIs with VAJ but little else. I felt cheated when I found that the database db2 provided in the CD did not work because it had expired even before I ran it the first time! In the later chapters on database access, we need a database so I had to use Access instead with a lot of trial and errors. Bad. I doubt if a beginner could do that. I hope the authors are careful about this. I bought this book solely for my VAJ certification exam, I doubt if its good enough for this though they say it is, in the Introduction."
1,BIG Waste of time,"The myth that heads up programming can replace heads-down programming is promoted in a book that essentially shows that beans are an over hyped immature technology. Don't let your managers talk you into using this junk! After only 4 short days I was able to finally get the example to add two numbers and show the result. The books focus is devoid of the theory of beans and is really a how-to book. Trouble is, the directions are so hard to follow that confusion becomes normal. Text is used to explain visual manipulations. If this really is a visual age, then you should give a visual explanation.If you want to learn beans, look elsewhere."
2,no m'ho crec,"Estem davant d'un llibre que ens parla d'un programa de la categoria del VisualAge COBOL! i no comenta la continua necessitat de salvar el treball,alhora com la falta d'informació jerárquica..."
5,Great Book,"My three year old love, love, loves this book! And, so do I. It is fun to read because he loves to yell Aarrrgghhh Spider! He is even recognizing the words,""out you go!"" now.I bought this book because my son does not like very wordy books, but I wanted more than just a picture book to help his language development. This book is in my opinion the perfect mix of the two.I highly recommend this book."
4,A new and creative way to look at spiders.,"Lydia Monks, author/illustrator, came up with a creative way to show the spiders can be domesticated pets too, but it takes hard work and determination. This clever spider tries everything it can to impress it's future family until it finally gives up and goes outside to live. The creative webs that are spun in the front yard tree, out of silver and glitter, catch the eye of the daughter and the spider finally gets what it's been yearning for, a family to live with and make as happy as a cat or dog would. The illustrations are so full of life that it's exciting to turn the page and see what is to come. Bright colors, expressive faces and cute child-like writing all add to this creative story about a not so typical spider."
4,A Very Hilarious Book,"This book will have you laughing out loud. The ending is a surprise, but, if read again, there are several signs that point to it. Written in the first person narrative, this book is full of outlandish adventures and comical mishaps on ""the storyteller's"" highway to fame. Told with dual protagonists, this book is certainly an unexpected delight for all ages!"
3,Useful but not perfect,I searched long and hard for a wired headset w/mic to use with VOIP on my netbook. The device had to be super-compact with easily stowable cords and had to work decently. My purpose for having this device is as a substitute for when my Jabra Bluetooth headset is not charged or other-wise unusable. This device fills the bill in most respects. The two shortcomings are 1)poorly fitting earpiece 2)inconsistant cord-length lock mechanism. The cord-length lock is getting better over time and I was able to fix the ear fit problem by replacing the provided ear-gel with a spare Jabra ear-gel. Much better! Sound quality (sending & receiving) is not stellar but is acceptable.
1,Completely useless,"I can only assume that the majority of other reviews here are false and written by a marketing company, for the length of cord and sound quality are completely inconsequential when you consider the fact that the earpiece *does not fit in your ear.* Don't get me wrong here, I don't have some weird ear physiology - my cell earpiece fits fine, my mp3 earbuds fit fine, but this thing isn't shaped for a human ear, nor does it allow the addition one of those little foam covers for a more snug fit.I'm actually more annoyed at being misled by these reviews than I am about the poor quality of the product; shame on people who do this."
3,OK product... for the price..,the cable is too short.. if you have a computer behind your desk.. you can forget about it
1,good merchant lousy product,the soft ear piece torn off after a short period of use. the seller refunded my money as soon as i reported the problem. i would buy from the same seller again but they need to do some quality control on their merchandise.
4,Nice little item,Clear and no static - good for trying out Skype or any other VOIP - works well - earpiece takes a little getting used to.
2,cute but not for me,"It's really but it just isn't for me...The crotch part is way too tight, I would stay away from one pieces if your buying in online."
2,The Hedgehog,I ordered this book because it was in a series of other nature books. I was surprised by the contents....it was a little too graphic for young ears I think. It gave too many details about how hedgehogs get their food and mate! I would not recommend this book and I was sorry that I bought it because I wanted it for my grandchildren. The illustrations were nice.
3,Even in 2011 this has a couple the others don't,"Woodstock Diary: This old CD should have been made obsolete several times over and yet, there are still a couple of cuts here that are not in the 40th anniversary box set or any of the previous sets. This has Richie Havens' ""I can't make it anymore"" and Mountain's ""Southbound Train"" (If I am not mistaken, this may be the only place to find these Woodstock performances on CD)."
3,missed opportunity,"This CD has a few tracks that were not available on Woodstock I, II or the boxed set. This in itself might persuade you to buy it. I still think that it's a missed opportunity though, as they could have released just previously unreleased tracks (there are plenty more in the vaults)."
5,How do you review these?,"OK, the things work and are strong.Service is great, arrived quickly and box contained some free samples of other products. Would deal with this company again."
5,excellent buy,This compilation combines both slow jams with fast tracks and is successful in blending the older songs with new jams. Very good value for your money-highly recommended.
2,"I want to dance, but this is a sleeping pill","I knew enough about dancing to be dangerous. It was time to do some serious reading up on what I wanted to do. This was my first book on dancing. Sadly, it did not excite me. The steps are laid out in such a style that you must step through them in order to see them. The dance descriptions and histories were good however. This would be a good book to refresh yourself from, while you're traveling on a plane or something, but it's not a good book to learn from."
5,Good tie,"Although the tie was a bit shorter than I wanted, it was still delivered in good time and made of decent fabric."
3,Solid White Tie,"The quality of the tie was not the best, realitivly one can buy a better quality tie for a similar price in Australia, but the speed the tie was shipped to me was amazing. It was bought and within a week I had my tie. I am satisfied with the service given by this store."
2,my mistake or not?,"it may have been my mistake to not read the tag for this tie, but i washed it as an ordinary white material and it turned yellow."
1,Leg Avenue Pirate Captain,"When I received my costume, it was smaller than the size chart said it would be. Also the ribbon in the front of the costume wasn't connected well and several of the strings which held it down were broken. A few more of those strings broke when I tried on the costume. Also, the black coat part had several smudges on it already. I returned it to the shipper as defective."
4,Review of Clower Walk New Testament,"I love this devotional. AMAZON has never let me down YET! Thank you. I have had this devotional for 19 years, and have bought extra copies to give to family and friends, and to my spouse, who is deployed. They enjoy them very much! They were in great condition and came in a timely fashion."
5,beautiful book and cards!,This set is a wonderful companion for life! It's also a great beginner set if you're unfamiliar with tarot. If you're drawn to Earth Wisdom and Native American Ways then you should buy this set. It continually brings out the beauty that is in you!
1,"THEY LOST, GET OVER IT LOSERS!","Contrary to some delusional reviewers, these arrogant goofs got their #%&*@'s kicked inside out by a handful of Romans{the real Latins}. In fact most everyone in Europe cleaned their clocks. This homage to them is a sad attempt to deconstruct historical truth. Just because the maps, index, and pictures are better than most revisionist garbage does not mean that the subject is a worthy one. One should just read the ancient authors and archaeology journals and forget the constant re-interpretations by writers with devious agendas."
5,Worth Every Penny!,"I ordered this bracelet as a gift for someone who picked it out for themselves. When I received it, I was very pleased with how well it is made and the raziliance. This is a heavy weight, durable item that I just may purchase for myself. 5 stars"
2,Looks sort of cheap,"Silver part is obviously painted. This bracelet is not bad, but it really does not look as good as the picture makes it out to be. I am not even sure if the jade is real. If it is real then the cheap setting is at least making it look fake."
3,Shiny sterling and jade bracelet,"If you like your bracelets with sparkle, this is one for you. The jade is classic pale green, and the sterling is very polished. Light weight sterling, not a heavy gram weight to it."
3,DISAPOINTING SEQUEL,"""Candyman"" is a horror classic,but the thrid is everything but a classic.""Candyman 3"" appears to have a very low budget,very poor acting,and like a lot of horror cheapies,it has no plot it at all.All ""Candyman 3"" is,is a cheap attempt to cash in on the first two's theatrical sucess and tries to revive an already dead horror series. For ""Candyman"" fans only,others will be wasting their money."
4,good.....,Im surprised at all the negative reviews for this film....comon....it was a good movie..really dark and spooky and much much better than the sequel...it had graphic violence which i liked...the plot was paper thin but the fun was in the violence and sometimes campy acting...overall...this movie was really good...and a big imporovement over part 2....see it only if u r a fan of the series though....
2,Horrendous,Clive Barker did a good job on the original Candyman. It was truly a cut above most horror movies. The second movie was medicore at best in my opinion but this one was just horrendous. There is no suspense at all in this movie and the acting is deplorable. Donna D'Errico is soft on the eyes but too bad she talks. Lets hope this is the last sequel.
2,They should stop here,"I LOVED Candyman 1, I LIKED Candyman 2, but Candyman 3 just didn't grab me. The series here goes direct-to-video and it really hurts the film. It just feels and looks cheaper than the first two. The story also isn't all that special. There just isn't anything new to do with Candyman. Tony Todd does a good job as the title role, by Donna De'errico leaves a bad taste in the mouth and makes the film seem really [inferior]. Whenever a baywatch beauty is featured in movie, it just makes the movie seem poor. Candyman fanatics may find some mild interest int he film, but it is passable. I really hope they end the series here. Part 3 is almost too much and a part 4 would push the series over the edge. But since the franchise is now owned by artisian home entertainenment, they will probably fork out another direct-to-video entry within the next five years. They did it with the Wishmaster series!"
1,3rd time really isn't the charm.,"Candyman is after his great-great-great-granddaughter, or someone like that, played by Donna Derrico. Yes, this sequel is simply horrendous, lacking any of the psychological and visceral scares of the original, and certainly missing any of the intriguing storytelling. Tony Todd is still an imposing figure as Candyman, but Derrico is awful, and why didn't she realize the only thing that could have made her performance bearable was showing some nudity?"
3,Candyman ultimate classic,Well im not surprised by all the negative reviews. I mean everyone knows that usually by the third sequel gets pretty cheesy. Nothing ever amounts to the original. But i love candyman. It's truly a masterpiece.
3,Further Explored,"This third sequel in the terrifyng Candyam series is a further decline, as you can feel more sympathy for the character as it does explain all along- a mob lynched and hazed him, pasting honey on his body and bringing a swarm of bees to eat him alive. It was about inter racial marriage, which again was almost unbearable to watch, and what was even more scary was that this happens in real life. A true old fashioned ghetto which again is the closest thing to a hell on earth."
1,"save yourselves, don't watch this movie","I absolutely ADORED Candyman, and the second one was one of the better sequels i have ever seen. when i heard that a third installment in the franchise was coming out, i couldn't wait to see it. i was, however extremely disappointed in this movie, more then any other movie i have ever seen. this movie should not even have the right to bare the name Candyman and how the makers of this film were able to convince Tony Todd to portray the Candyman again, is beyond me! spare yourself an hour and a half of pure boredom and rent the original! the only part of interest in the entire movie was Donna D'Errico's obvious FAKE faint! someone should give the girl a lesson on how to faint with a touch of realism! sorry Donna, but it wasn't your best work by far!"
2,"Better than the second, but thats nothing to brag about","The last living descendent of the Candyman (Donna D'Errico) is haunted by dreams telling her to destroy the Candyman myth. It basically has the same plot of the other two installments, but still has lame murder sequences and poor scripting that doesn't make it anything special. Its rather ironic that every sequel always ignores the end of the previous Candyman movie. How many times do they have to kill him? When will he just die and this cycle of depressingly average sequels finish."
1,What a rediculous pile of poo.,"You're kidding, right? The only good film in the trilogy is the origonal. How dare you try to continue the story of something that cannot be continued. The orgional was good enough. Leave it there. Just because you want money, don't ruin such wonderfull entertainment.I didn't even stay awake through all of the movie, it was so bad! I'd rather watch Barney with my 2-year-old!"
3,A GOOD ENTRY IN THE SERIES,"After the classic Candyman, this is a good sequel. I think this is a much better movie than part 2. Part 2 I have mixed feelings on, it's not a great movie, but with this third entry in the series, I think it a not bad sequel. I'm not claiming it's an amazing film, but it is good. The two leads of Nick Corri and Donna D'Errico were good. I love Nick Corri-very sexy. (He should be remembered for 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' as rod lane).If your a fan of the series, then this is a must in the collection."
2,Typical sequel fare - nothing original,"As an avid horror fan I LOVED Candyman, LIKED Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh, but I have to say that I didn't really like Candyman 3. The acting was pretty bad - even the Candyman himself was not that intimidating or scary. Of course, the Baywatch beauties are an eye-feast but when it comes to intriguing characters no way - I could have cared less about what was happening to them. Watch out for tired, rehashed special effects. What's with the pasted on bees! My advice is to go rent the original Candman again and enjoy the movie."
1,I'd give it negative one if i could!,"Oh My God! This movie blew total burrito chunks! I LOVED the first two, but this one was SO bad--the acting, the special effects....everything! (especially the stunts-check out Donna D'errico's fainting..it deserves multiple rewindings! ) DOnt waste your money!"
1,If you thought the first Candyman sequel was bad.....,"Candyman 3: Day of the Dead, such a terrible movie, I found myself wondering ""Who in the hell could like this movie?"" Surely not the people whom flipped for the original film. Candyman (1992) is a very scary film, Clive barker's story was frightening and interesting, this second hand follow up turns the hook handed phantom into a sixth or seventh rate Freddy knock off, I found myself praying to get a glimpse of the BEAUTIFUL female lead in this movie naked, for that would of helped the proceedings along a little bit. But when that is what you find yourself wishing for when watching a sequel to the modern classic, you know that all the lousy FX, sixth grade screenplay and terrible acting have killed the hopes for a decent Candyman sequel."
1,hugely disappointing....,"This movie is just the same as the others but just with a different skin, there is no horror in this film at all, it's more comedy than horror, it is just the same cheap bull as the second one (wich also stinks) and why does he open his jacket when we already know what he has under there.This movie is stupid do not waste you time/money on it, but still buy it if you really must, but don't say no one warned you."
4,a great ghost story,"The only problem I had with the book was the mention of the christian view of the afterlife. Other than that it was great, and very funny."
4,Another installment in the 'three-buck library',"It's amazing how full a library of well-recorded staples one can buy from great orchestras without spending more than $3-$5 on the used market (or more than the price of a Naxos CD on the new market). This Dvorak ""New World"" from Muti and the Philharmonia Orch. is a case in point. It doesn't rank with the very best for good reason: Muti seems indifferent to making the work sound anything better than a familiar warhorse.But then you stand back and look at the price, and his conventional reading is very competitive. It's civilized, nicely recorded, and performed by a world-class orchestra. I'm not out to promote second-rate CDs, but there's a big difference between second-rate and second to the best, the respectable niche that this vigorous New World belongs in."
2,Good Try --- But No Cigar,"Takes a shot at explaining what it is to be an American, but, does only a so-so job. Good try -- but no cigar. If you're really interested in the answers, let me recommend the only one I have ever read that gives them and explains them. I suggest you read ""West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson"", by Remick."
4,Is America A Republic?,"In this book Gary Hart looks at the problems facing America, asking if the corruption in our government may mean we no longer are a true Republic, and offers solutions. Originally a book that was to focus on placing greater control in the hands of 'ward republics' or divisions created below the county level, it mentions some issues concerning the militia and defending America. With September 11th, Hart went back to re-write some portions of the book to increase the emphasis on defending America. Overall, his research on Jefferson (who originally proposed these ward republics) and the issues of Jeffersonianism throughout American history would be enough to buy the book. His proposals for the 21st Century are just extra, but are not fleshed out enough to warrent a five."
2,Misunderstanding Jefferson,"This book should be called ""misunderstanding Thomas Jefferson"". Its interpretation of Jefferson's political philosophy is weak and highly speculative. One has to read everything that Jefferson himself read and wrote, philosophically, to understand him. The author looked at a narrow slice of Jefferson (ward republics) out of context with Jefferson's world view."
2,Disappointed,"This book appeared to be fashionable because it was authored by the name, Gary Hart. Having read just about everything on Thomas Jefferson, I rushed out to get this one. After reading it, I was disappointed. It was long on explaining Mr.Hart's personal opinions and short on explaining Thomas Jefferson's philosophy behind his idea of ""ward republics"". I have to tell you, I got more information and enjoyment out of another book about Jefferson's philosophy, including a section on ward republics, that pre-dates this book that I read a couple of years ago called ""West Point: Character Leadership...Thomas Jefferson"" by Norman Thomas Remick."
5,its awsome,u poeple rate this less than a 8mb memory card. THIS HAS 8x MORE MEMORY THAN THE SONY 1!!!!! do u rate this lower because of the brand. even the price is lower. cmon now
3,Would NOT get it...,"I bought one of these for my original playstation (psx), and it Broke my system. I now always use sony branded accessories on my PS2 now. I do not want to wait another 12 hours in line to get my ps2.but if you are looking for something cheap buy this.BUT beware, if you ever want to see your ps2 work again get a sony brand."
5,Get this card,"If you are looking for a card, get this one. My brother bought another cheaper version, and he has to insert a cd before he can load his card.This card was just as cheap and has no problems. Loads like normal, no extra steps.Just get it."
4,Mad about Mad Catz,"I've owned Mad Catz third-party periphrials before and have been very well pleased with each purchases. The Mad Catz PS2 memory card is no exception. I've been using it for about five months now and have only seen very minor problems with it. First, some older, first generation launch titles (Ridge Racer V, ATV OffRoad, etc.) have trouble reading the card. However, this can be fixed by simply trying your luck a second time.The second thing I've noticed is that you must secure the card very firmly into the PS2 or it will not read either.Other than those two fixable problems (and the fact that it's hidious), the Mad Catz is a superb card for the price it sales at."
4,A very good card,"Ive had this card ever since Christmas of 2000 and it still works perfectly. I recommend taking good care of your memory card. The people who gave this card a bad rating probably didn't take care of the memory card. When I'm not using it, I put mine in the case. I hope to find a PSX card as good as this one for use with my Playstation 2."
1,Dead on Arrival,"The card I ordered arrived completely inoperative and had to be returned, a very annoying and time-consuming procedure."
5,Best Memory Card,"I bought this memory card when i got my PS@ which was about 4 weeks ago, and i havented had any problems. This card has never froze and alwaysa saves, so far i am totaly impressed with the memory card. These cards are also very stylish, i like the clear colors and the shape"
2,do they all come broken?????,i bought this memory card yesterday. i took it home and popped it in.it did not work it was broken. took it back and got another one and it was broken.so i got the sony one and it works fine. i mean dont get me wrong the shipment could have been knocked around but 2 out of 2 broken???? my friend has one and a sony one. it seems that the sony one loads twice as fast as this one and its easier to get out of the playstation. this one is a little tight in the console. so just because its 5 dollars less dont think it is just as good. if you ask me i would spend the extra five bucks and get a memory card that will work when you need it to.thanx alot and happy gameing outhere.
4,Memory Card,well i seem to really see no difference in the difference between the regular sony memory card and this one so its the same to me they are both good cause you need to save your game dont you?
3,WARNING!,BEWARE! If you just bought or got a Playstation 2 don't get this card! If you have problems with your PS2 while using this Sony can't help you (because it is not from Sony)! So I suggest you get the original for $5 more.
1,SPEND THE EXTRA 5 BUCKS,DO NOT BUY THIS MEMORY CARD! I never even took this card out of my playstation and today a month after buying it it decides to loose my grand theft auto game and grand tourismo game which i was 75% complete BUY THE SONY MEMORY CARD!
5,This memory card rules,"this memory card is just like the one made by sony..oh wait..sony tested this one too! only 29.99 with a better looking card with a case.the sony one doesnt come with it. oh yeah, that person that posted the review about not liking it...he put the card in a playstation console which you cant do, no wonder his playstation broke. this is only for the ps2"
2,waste of money,"this memory card only let me save my game so far into it then it said there was a failure trying to load my game, so i had to start all over from the beginning. it was a pain in the neck. it happened to me 3 times. finally i bought a sony card and it works better."
3,Nexxus Botanic oil,"This product is an alright product. It has natural ingredients. It is good to use as a hot oil treatment. My problem with this product is that it is too expensive. I decided to get the guts and get the nexxus botanic oil because I met this lady who testified that the product was sooooo good, so I decided to try it. I will not be buying this product again because I think coconut oil works a lot better for me plus coconut oil is way cheaper than this product."
1,leave this book at home,"this is a history of prague and everything in it, with a bit of information about traveling there. i would not call it a guide book or anything that is really going to help you in travel planning."
1,Good for a laugh,"Avery tries to pass his chemical company advocacy off as science. If you are familiar with real science, you might just want to read this for the laughs. If you are looking for actual information, don't read this--it will only confuse you."
4,War and Peace,"War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy is a very involving and intricate novel about the struggle for victory between the French and the Russians with more of a focus on the private lives of the Russians. The story is extremely interesting and thought provoking, but you should only try to read it if you have a lot of free time on your hands. If you have the time and patience I suggest that you read this book. This book shows the every day struggle that comes from a war whether you are a soldier, poor man, or rich land lord, and that it effects everyone equally. The book follows numerous people through out the book and doesn't focus on one perticular person, but it does tell what happens to many different people. The story is a very hard to read book and if you don't stick with it and try to tough it out you'll have to start over continually, so if you want to read this book just keep at it and you'll get it. I really hope you'll read it because it is a really good and interesting book."
5,Like A Full Time Diatom Filter,"To put it succinctly, Wow! This stuff is great.My betta lives in a 5.5 gallon aquarium. I have the 100 ML bag in the right side of my Marina Slim 10 power filter. The regular Marina carbon and ceramic cartridge is in the left slot. My water was clear before, but now it looks like my betta is swimming in air. Wonderful stuff. Highly recommended."
3,It has the music but forgets the festival,"I was somewhat disappointed with this boxed set which I had been looking forward to playing. Although it has much of the music from the original three record set, which I have, and from the movie, plus much more, what it lacks is the real flavor of what Woodstock was. For some inexplicable reason, they left out almost all of the stage announcements and crowd noise which, for those who were there, those who saw the movie, or even for those who wished they were there, really defined the experience. Where was the ""no rain"" cheer, Chip Monk of the Hog Farm announcing ""breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand"" or Max Yasgur's greeting of praise for the the crowd? All that was a big part of Woodstock. To just have the music ignores the event itself. I'd recommend the remastered original instead."
3,Why ?. Just give me a good reason why ...,"this 25th Anniversary Box Set of such an important musical event is so poorly packaged . When I was 14 years old , my father made his first trip to the Usa ( 1970 ) , and he was nice enough to buy me two of my first Lp's . Woodstock and Frank Sinatra's Strangers in the Nite . Woodstock opened a new musical world for me . So , not listening to the reviews offered at Amazon ( big mistake , Again ) , I went ahead and ordered this excuse of a Box Set . Memory is a strong asset , and , yes , where are the announcements , the original sequence ( that could have been inserted with the new material ) , the Original art work ( who made this tasteless cd covers )??? , I did like what happened in 1969 , but who keeps this bulky booklets at hand when playing the music ??? , etc... The let downs are too many to count . So , I am going to have to order the original Woodstock and with it , make my own Cd's . Any way ...."
2,Only one song from THE WHO,"This box set is bad because it only has one song from THE WHO at that time and still is the best live band ever. At least Hendrix, CCR, and CSN are repsented here. For some of these other bands it was the end of their days and thank god for that!Oh i forgot Richie Havens he rocks too."
3,Nostalgic,Needed the Woodstock feel and sound. Missing the Grateful Dead. How can they leave out the greatest band in the land!!!!! The rest is fun.
3,Just release all the music on cd,What should be done is the entire 3 days of music and artist comments should just be released on a bunch of cd's. That would satisfy everyone and I'm shure it would sell if was at a reasonable price.
2,Frustrating,"I agree with the review that claims: why didn't they release new material? If not a problem of quality with the recordings, why didn't the producers include one single track from the amazing Incredible String Band, for instance, or even the entire set by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, since Woodstock was a very good moment by them and their second (consequently, historical) apresentation."
5,A Great Foundation,I just received this book and I could not put it down. This is a great place to start if you want to learn how to build a Flash based application.
3,Not a Friends of Ed winner...,It dissapointed me. Totally different to what I was used to expect from a FOED book. I understant that the theme is not that easy but they shouldn't make it more complicated either!Anyway I am a fan of FOED and will continue to be my choice #1.
3,SOMEONE'S IN NEED OF A CASH INJECTION!,This cd is ok but to me it was a rushed effort they should have done a live box set consisting of a couple cds from 87 onward and where the hell was civil war and wild horses from their Paris 92 gig which was cool! All in all ok cd purchase but could have been so much more.
3,Too Good?,"The band sounds incredible and Axl's voice holds up well. In fact, it holds up too well. I saw them twice live and don't remember Axl sounding that great. Think there was some studio magic going on during the producing of this CD?"
3,Live Era '87-93,"""Live Era '87-93"" Like all bands ,I think Guns N Roses sound better on studio recordings. But I do really like the longer piano piece at the beginning of "" November Rain"". A good albumn for big fans of Guns & Roses."
4,The Best Live Album I Own,"I have to start by saying I'm not really a huge fan of live albums. Some are great, and some are, well, really awful. This album blew me away. Being a HUGE Guns N' Roses fan, I had to get it, and I was not disappointed at all. The quality is great and the more I listen to it, the more I wish I had lived back in that era. I could feel the energy of Slash's guitar, the power of Axl's vocals, that arena of fans chanting back the chorus to GN'R's cover of ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" (the best rendition I've heard). It's just such a good album; it makes you feel something, and even if you don't like Guns N' Roses, this will change your mind. It's more than a CD, it's an experience."
2,Edited CD NOT enjoyable,"I don't even know why they bothered with an edited CD for the explicit lyrics. I mean, isn't that what G N R's all about? It seems like every other word is phased out, although you can still hear the music. The reasoning for making this edited version is beyond me. Trust me, get the explicit lyrics version, it's (bleeping) better!"
3,Buy a bootleg,"This is a flat, overproduced bit of almost a guns show. Pick up any of the various bootlegs if you want to hear better, more energetic & un-hacked versions of these songs."
3,It's GUNS but not '87-93,"I gave this 3 stars because the title is misleading. I love Guns and saw them several times in concert. The title of this should be ""A concert from 1992"". I'm sure a lot of you have the MTV Ritz concert from 1987 on video tape, as an example - they should release a CD of concerts from that time period. I guess I was hoping for tracks recorded in 1987 or so, but none here are. That horn section in 'Move to the City' loses a whole star all by itself.But hey its Guns - it rocks. Just going to the record store to buy a new record by the (mainly) original GUNS N ROSES was pretty f'ing cool."
3,Crushing Disappointment,"As I listened to this CD, I wondered if I had hyped it too much in my mind. I saw GnR in Baton Rouge in 1992. They blew the roof off of the Assembly Center. They rocked for 3 1/2 hours. This CD does not have 1/10 the energy of that show. Who selected these cuts? What about Coma, Don't Damn Me, Double Talkin' Jive, Garden of Eden, Civil War, etc. Anything but Move to the City. Where are the elaborate intros to Sweet Child, Paradise City, Knockin' On Heaven's Door. Why do we hear Axl asking the crowd to move back from the stage. Why not one of his trademark rants? Where and when were these songs recorded? Across the Universe? What is that? I can only hope they correct their mistakes and put out another live CD. This time I will listen to it first."
3,"Good effort, but poor quality","Live Era 97-93 includes many of GNR's greatest tracks. I was dissapointed they left out ""Civil War"" the theme to the ""Godfather"" and other covers that they usually played at their live gigs. Don't get me wrong, this is a good set and a must have for any GNR fan, but I was very disappointed with the sound quality of the discs. I have heard much better quality for live shows on discs compared to ""Live Era."" Too many times on the discs, the GNR's music is drowned out by the crowd noise and it was very difficult to hear Axl."
5,Engery of the Band Captured Perfectly,"A great live double-CD. When I listen to this I'm transported back to 1990 in the Citrus Bowl in Orlando seeing this great band at its peak.The live version of ""You're Crazy"" is just as I remember it - not as fast as it was on ""Appetite"" and not as slow as it was on ""Lies."" A fantastic, bluesy, somewhere in between.""You Could Be Mine"" is another highlight as is, of course, ""Paradise City.""If you don't like this recording, you don't like GNR."
5,Best cd's I own to date!,"These cd's are by far better than any live album's ever. I think they are better than the regular album's, because they give me a different version of the band. Besides AXL ROSE, and SLASH have so much power live. AND, I think it's funny how the sales rank was around 5000 about 2 weeks ago, and now it dropped. FUNNY how the sales rank drops after more album's are purchased. Don't worry, buy this and enjoy probably the best music ever written by any artist EVER!"
3,axl... wake up and get your original band back together!,"gn'r live is pretty good. i miss seeing this band live. hell... i miss this band, and this cd is all i have to remember them by. it's great to hear all those great songs off of appetite, lies, and the illusions because those were awesome albums. overall, the whole album is a nice reminder of what this band was, and what it could have been. if you are a fan, get this because axl won't sound like this again. and if axl reads this... just say your sorry, burry the hatchet with duff, slash, matt, and izzy and come back to reality because without them what is present on the live album will be your only memories of what the once great guns n' roses were: one of the greatest rock bands ever!"
4,Wow! A Live CD From Guns N' Roses,"The thing that most shocks me about this CD is that it even exists. But then I realized, it must be from more than one concert, because rarely did Axl ever finish a concert without throwing a childish fit and running off the stage. I've seen them twice, and both times he left early, causing near riots. Once because his mike was not working properly. Hey, I only spent 50 bucks, and I got to see Axl come to near tears over his mike being broken. This is a good CD, with all the hits live, so buy it, because you never know what songs you might miss near the end of the next concert, when Axl runs away mad."
5,gnr live,"this is quite possibly one of the greatest albums i have ever owned. a true fan will love it, and the patience cut is amazing. the best part is that you can hear duff's backups so well!"
3,Great but nothing new,"To quickly sum it up, this is great cd BUT, the only good songs are on Appetite For Destuction (the 1st cd) which you can get for 10 bux! That cd is a five!"
1,Boring and very disappointing,"I love Guns and Roses and i am still an objective music fan. This is by far, the worst live recording i have ever heard. Uninspired and a terrible mix. Take the soundtrack to the Use Your Illusion DVD's as being better than this. Obviously this was overdubbed to death without Slash, Izzy or Duff."
5,Great live CD!,This is what live rock and roll should sound like! This album is a pure rush from start to finish!
2,not nearly as F**KIN ROCKIN as the originals,"ahhhh... YES, cool cover, but a disappointment. this just ain't as ELECTRIC as the versions on 'Appetite' or 'Illusions'. Axel's 'cleaned-up'vocals and harmonies (read: re-recorded)really let the air out, for starters.and, yeah: i saw these guys on the upswing at the Whiskey 87, Pasadena's Perkins Palace 4-nite stand 12/87, etc. and they really WERE amazing... sadly, this set just doesn't capture it at all. (then again, maybe it was the whiskey and the spirit of the time...)if you buy this, G'n'R fans, you'll be entertained for a couple listens; but, you'll end up spinning the originals by new year's..."
2,A Decent Attempt,"I saw Guns n' Roses live before they became headliners and didn't enjoy the show but have enjoyed their music over the years since.I was surprised at a few songs that were not included here that were (from what I hear) staples of their live shows.Songs like....""Live and Let Die"",""Civil War"" and ""Hair of the Dog"".....songs that would have made this cd a whole lot better and much more enjoyable.Most people have said that songs like ""November Rain"" and a few other songs shouldn't have been included on the cd but in my opinion (although I personally don't enjoy their ballad style songs)they are there to represent the entire career of the band.I rate this cd at 2 stars not because of poor musicianship or sound quality or anything that is on the cd,I rate it that way because there is so much this cd could have been but never made it to its full potential."
3,Good but not Great!,"If you are a GNR fan then this is a must, as to me it shows the range of songs that GNR managed to record, however I do agree with the other reviews in that the mix does seem to be a bit rough (apparently Slash helped!) also it seems that there are more songs from the UYI than AFD which I would of preferred still worth having though!"
4,The Key to GNR's live performances is missing,"I bought this CD expecting to hear some of the versions of the songs I remembered in concert. Unfortunately, the free styled guitar solos, extra verses and improv antics are missing. Sweet Child O' Mine does not include the extra verses on this double disc, and the version of Knockin' on Heaven's Door was not taken from the Club Ritz. The people who put the album together got it right on some of the tracks--like including the extra long intro to November Rain, however I feel it a necessity to include all of what made GNR an excellent live band if they are to truly capture the ""Live Era"" that was Guns N' Roses. This is a good CD to add to the GNR collection, but its no loss if you do not go out and purchase it. I suggest holding out for ""Chinese Democracy"" in the new year, or if you are craving some live music now, pick up Metallica's S&M, that truly is what live music should be about: noise, dynamics, musicianship, and emotion."
4,gun this rose,"I generaly don't care for live albums but I really like this one. It's full of good energy from the audience and good music. The songs don't follow a timeline from their early days to their later ones so one song will be from their earlier days and it will have a raw sound to it then the next song will be from a later concert and it will have back up singers, horns and the piano. I like that aspect of this album but it might bother some listeners. Whether you're a casual fan like me or a die hard fan you should get this album."
4,"Flawed, but still very good!!!","Guns n' roses was an awesome band. They had their ups and downs. This 2-Cd set is a perfect example of this.Disc one is a great Cd. It has some great songs. It truly shows off Axl Roses great stage personality. Used To Love Her is a great improvement over the original. This first disc is a classic, except for a few sound problems.Disc Two has a lot of problems. They try and make it seem like this is all part of one show. The sound is pretty pathetic on most of the songs. Sweet Child O' Mine is just plain pitiful. They should have picked another version to make it sound a lot better. Paradise City kind of seems to drag on. Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a positive on this disc which needs some retuneing."
4,A nice clean-up,"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# 0694905512, Playing Time 132:49This version of the 2-disc set comes to you as a censored version, where all instances of the F word have been cleaned. The masking is well done, so you can blast this without risking that your parents will come running into your room.There's a ton of reviews for the regular version, with quite a variety of opinions. For my part, I like the CD because it presents GNR at their best: performing in front of an audience. The versions are generally well performed, but different enough from the studio versions to make this set a nice addition to their studio albums."
1,I can answer your Question,"The CD is messed up, so I have heard. The track list is out of whack and in fact I believe the CD is being recalled. Hope this clears things up."
1,This one is a dog,"This is far and away the WORST album I have ever heard, and I enjoy alot of songs by Guns N' Roses. The problems with the album are many, but I have outlined the most egregious offenses herein.First, the crowd noise overpowers many of the songs, which should have been cleaned up before releasing these live performances. Second, the music overpowers many of the vocals. Third, the melodic tone of a number of the songs is just lost, either because Axle is trying to scream rather than sing, or GN'R is just plain lousy in concert.If you wish to add a CD to your collection of ""those CDs rarely listened to,"" then by all means buy this one. Otherwise, stay away ... very far away from this dog."
3,Pretty good,"I just got this CD last week and have listened to it a few times and have found it to be pretty good. The problem I have with it is due to to Mr Rose's continual use of foul language. Come on, is this really necessary? Where did he learn to speak this way? He is also extremely insulting to women and women issues. You might find Bon Jovi a little more pleasing then the foul mouthed Axel."
4,its gnr but,its got alot great gnr songs live but heres my problem the sound quality sucks this has to be one of the worst sounding live cds ever made u get around that u get a glimpse at what guns n roses once were the rolling stones of this generation not just an 80s band they continued on and had thier biggest hits in the 90s like november rain they grew as a band into legends and until they finally release the new cd this will wet your taste buds a time that seems like yesterday but is almost 20 years ago
5,GREAT DISK,This is by far my favorite band of all time. This disc doesn't totally capture the insanity of there live performance but it ROCKS! Buy it and one for a friend. This is the real GnR not the rip off of the name that will be putting out a GnR album in the near future.
5,Butt kicking Awasome,If you have got the love of 80's hard rock this is for you.GnR is blowin it out of the water in this one
2,Not worth buying,"In addition to other comments: the versions of the songs presented here are far from the best ones available. Sometimes the band sounds like they desperately need to sober up/get their act together, or as if they're just bored.Mastering is bad: when you get crackling during solos no need to reach to check your speakers - it's on the recording.Contrary to what I was expecting this album sounds completely uninspiring, and it has Civil War missing. Look elsewhere for GNR."
2,Save your money,"I have tried this video 3 times now. Normally I like something that i can pop in, it will give me a decent cardio workout and at the end I feel as if I've accomplished something. If you feel the same, then this is not the video for you. There is no intructional portion to familiarize yourself with the moves before hand, you have to figure it out as you go. By the time I watch to see what foot they're starting on, the full body movement, and get the hang of that move, she's onto the next step, where again, I have to figure out what she's doing. I spend more time watching the video than actually moving. Definately not something you can just jump into and have fun. If all her videos are put together this way, I will definately not be buying another one ever."
5,Love it!,"Great DVD for after I had my baby, can see a difference. Plus I don't have to leave the house to workout."
3,It doesn't really get your heart rate up.,I really like Denise Austin but I'm afraid this dance workout is just paced way too slow and doesnt' really get your heart pumping. I've tried going a little faster than her to get my heart rate up but.. And its something about the footwork in the last dance that is just off. I do a lot of Zumba and Core Rythms and they really get your heart rate up and this just doesn't. But if you're a beginner and not really looking for a high impact workout this may be for you. Just a little too slow for me.
4,Suprisingly Good,"This DVD suprised me. It's actually quite good and of intermediate challenge.The 30 minute cardio/dance section was really fun to do. The first part had more of a latin flair and the second part was more hip-hop oriented. It was also easy to modify the moves to make them higher impact for a more intense workout.The 10 minute standing Pilates segment worked the upper body and core with weights. The time just flew by.There is also a 10 minute floor Pilates routine targeting the abs and legs. Strap on wrist and ankle weights and it becomes nicely challenging. Denise is also very pleasant throughout, just the right amount of friendliness. My only gripe is the music. Had they used better and more motivating music in the dance portion, this would have been a 5-star workout."
2,not quite perfect,"gasket broken when it arrived. I was lucky that I had a spare in my garage. casting is poor (holes weren't exactly the same size) this was a bit disappointing. Purchased to replace this part on 87 chevy pickup to eliminate exhaust leak. I hope this works. New design in that it has what may be known as ""heat expansion cuts"" weird but we'll see if they work. old models are one solid piece of metal--this has notches, very weird to look if you're old school.*UPDATE* 12/11/2012Returned manifold to Amazon. Do an internet search before buying this manifold. I ran across several poor reviews regarding this manifold. Did not fix exhaust leak. Not sure if even when brand new one is supposed to take this piece to be machined. My understanding is that the solid piece should be straight across--there were gaps at least 1/8th of an inch. Poor craftsmanship."
2,Bad Band,"I really liked the look of the watch, but after wearing it for several months the band broke and there are no replacements available other than sending it back to Nike and you know how that goes. I won't see the watch for months. plus the band was almost as much as I paid for the watch."
1,one of them was empty,one of them was empty and the other ones cleared out very fast without being used properly.
5,very saisfied with seller,Not sure if I left feedback so I wanted to do it now.Very good seller-prompt-efficient-I recommend them!
4,Another Toby Peters,"Stuart Kaminsky has given his dependable Toby Peters mystery series a little twist, pairing his detective with his recently retired brother. The pairing definitely gives the series a spark, all without sacrificing any of the trademark wit or cleverness. Kaminsky's series is filled with interesting characters and this one is no exception; magician Harry Blackstone is the featured celebrity and he is put to good use. And, as always, Kaminsky makes excellent use of Los Angeles in the 1940s."
5,A Great Book by a Great Travel Writer!!,"Reading travel books is always interesting and leaves you wanting (or not) to go to that country of travel. Tom Brosnahan has taken his passion of writing Guide books to writing his experience in a country still somewhat foreign to many North Americans. He places Turkey in the well deserved position it has tried so hard to be noticed for, it's People, Culture and a land of History. The stories take place in the late 60's at a time things were changing.I think this book will make you want to get on the next flight out (maybe even to stay awhile and teach english). If your thinking of going to Turkey have a read through this book first. It is a great book and goes well with Tom's Brosnahan past Turkey guide book from Lonely Planet."
4,Great Little Read,"This is not a guide book, but a charming meandering through Turkey with a guide book author. The descriptions of the people, places and things is wonderful. I enjoyed every page but must now find a guide book to help with our upcoming trip to this fascinating country."
3,There is no quality control in the editing,I really bought this Dvd because I trusted the demanding quality in terms of image and sound by the people from Deutsche Grammophon. But I can tell you that the image is quite poor and even in the last 4 minutes of the third track the color even fades and turns into black and white until the beginning of the next track. I love Beethoven's nineth symphony but I think it is a pity that nobody really supervised the editing well. I felt quite disappointed.
2,supreme egotism,"Great playing, terrible visuals - especially endless close-ups of HvK (who had a big hand in the editing). OK to listen to without any picture."
1,short dated,"The price was great, but the film was short dated; 09/2001.I would not have bought 10 rolls had I known."
1,800sp. film isn't always best!!!,"Kodak advertises 800sp. film as being their most versatile film, but I do not agree. I have used this speed and I have worked in a photo lab and developed it. You should not use 800sp. film on bright sunny days!! It over-exposes your negatives and makes your pictures washed out. I would only used 800sp. film if I was photographing something that was very fast motion, like a car race. I think the reason Kodak tries to push this speed of film is because it is their most expensive, not because it's the best. 800sp. film is also very ""grainy."" If you get a photo that you really like you cannot enlarge it and have it look good because the film grain is so noticable. Generally, I tend to use 200sp. film most of the time, and I never have any problems. It works well outside on sunny days and with a flash in low-light situations. However, this is just my opinion. I am not an expert, just a consumer."
2,updike overwriting as usual,"Updike for me is a very inconsistent writer. Loved his In the Beauty of Lilies, Rabbit is Rich, Rabbit at Rest,Witches of Eastwick but couldn't finish his Rabbit, Run and don't even want to start Rabbit Redux.The problem with Updike is overwriting like in Rabbit, Run.Roger's Version seems bit dated and argument seems trivial. Of course, there is always lots of sex in all his books but cringe-inducing quasi-incest ( sex with daughter-in-law or niece) is a turn-off. In this book, there is a sex scene that is best I've ever read. I own almost all his books but I don't think I'll or want to continue reading him. I rather reread Martin Amis's books.I recommend a review of one his later books (forgot the title) by David Foster Wallace. Look it up. It pretty much sums up problem with Updike."
2,Depressing and tasteless,"Having enjoyed a few of John Updike's books, I pounced on this at the library. I forced myself to read until the end, but it was so depressing and so cringe-worthy that it literally choked me to finish it. The storytelling I can find little fault with, and perhaps it's this very talent which was so good at making me cringe and turn away in disgust at many parts of the book. I'm quite open-minded in my selection of reading material and the erotica in this is nothing to what I have read in many other books, but some things just cross the line of humanity and I was shocked that he was allowed to keep such terrible innuendo hinting at the worst possible perversion in this book. Read only if you don't mind being further affected by the worst of humanity in our current world. I have regretted few books as much as I regretted this one and I may as well just read a daily newspaper depicting the same stories to get the same depressing effect."
3,It affected me....just in the WRONG way!,"Very good writing and style, intriguing story. However, I guess I just didn't expect to feel somewhat sickened and a bit depressed by the story. If you want to be AFFECTED, than this book is for you. It'll grab hold of you and won't let go. It just wasn't what I was expecting. If I want to feel disgust at the actions of human beings, I'll go ahead and buy a book about Ted Bundy."
3,Good Value Chopin But Fair-to-Midland Reading,"At under $10 EMI's package of both Chopin piano concertos is a bargain to be sure, and a fine recording for anyone wishing an introduction to these particular pieces. However, should you enjoy this music consider it an appetizer to greater readings. Weissenberg's play is a bit forceful on the ivories and the orchestra accompanyment (Orchestre de la Societe des Concerts du Conservatoire) is average at best. Overall the sound is satisfactory and clear.For those looking for more definitive interpretations I would recommend Martha Argerich's performance of both concertos with the Montreal Symphony under Dutoit; Murray Perahia playing Concerto No. 1 with the New York Philharmonic under the baton of Zubin Mehta; or any of several readings by the final arbiter of Chopin, Artur Rubinstein. The Aergrich and Perahia recordings excell in technical excellence while Rubinstein, known to miss a note now and then, imparts unequaled feeling and emotion."
5,"Great book for learning AI with Prolog, but....","... a horrible Prolog tutorial.This is not a good first book on Prolog. If you are new to Prolog and Logic Programming, you should read 'Art of Prolog' first.Prolog is quite different from other languages, and you'll need some time to get it. This book doesn't give you that time: after briefly introducing the basic concepts, Bratko dives at breakneck speed into recursion and list processing.Don't get me wrong, this is a magnificent book on how to do AI with Prolog, but it shouldn't be your first Prolog book. It's an excellent second book."
5,EXCELLENT!,"As always, Reba gives us another fabulous album! Every song is such a touching story that will catch your heart. 'We're so good Together' is the song that Reba has dedicated to her fans. This is an excellent choice for yourself or for a gift. You will love it!"
1,ANOTHER LET DOWN,Some songs are o.k. on this but not enough for me to give this CD more than one star. Its just more crossover stuff.
1,NOT EVEN ONE STAR IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS!!,"In my opinion this is the worst CD that Reba has ever put out. The background music is so loud and so poppish that I absolutely cannot stand it. There is one good track and thats her cover of ""We're All Alone"" a duet with Jose and Durval. But its inconsequential and doesn't justify being on this album. Even what seems to be a plaintive, traditional country song ""Roses"", is drowned out by the overproduction and they ruin it. ""I'll Be"" is a Diane Warren tune and Diane Warren is a pop writer, not a country writer. That should tell you the whole story here. This is a CD for lovers of that kind of music. If you love real country music you are going to Hate this Cd as much as I do!!"
1,ONLY TWO SONGS ARE GOOD HERE,"""The Roses"" and ""Nobody Dies From a Broken Heart"" are good. The rest is just pop stuff!! I don't know where people are hearing country because I certainly am not hearing it."
5,Three songs...,I bought this CD for three songs. I oridnally bought it for two of the songs...What Do You SayandI'll beBut discovered a few other songs on there that I now love.
3,Not her best and not her worst,"This CD from Reba is not her best nor her worst. There are only 4 songs on here worth listening to. The best song on here is ""What Do You Say"" and it is about everyday life to a little boy asking what the 3 X's in a window mean to a mother battling cancer and what can you say to those circumstances. The second song is ""I'll Be"" and I like it because Reba sings her heart out on this song like she does all of her slow songs and it is kind of a sad song. The 3rd song is ""We're All Alone"" the duet with Jose Y Durval and it is a wonderful duet that they do together. It was recorded by Boz Scaggs and again by Rita Coolidge but Reba does an outstanding job on this song. The 4th is ""We're So Good Together"" a fast paced song and one that gets your feet a tapping to the beat. Other than those the rest are not that good."
3,NOT BAD,"First of all I have to say that I absolutely hate the title track and am glad it was not released as a single!! The loud licks of that darned electric guitar could make one go deaf!! The rest of the CD is pretty good, sometimes even excellent. I love ""Back Before the War"", and I think ""She Wasn't Good Enough for Him"" is one of the prettiest songs she's ever done. ""Roses"" is gorgeous!! So is ""We're All Alone""....Reba is so spectacular on this because there is no overkill! THe song about the ""Broken Heart"" is horrible. I didn't like that one at all. ""I'll Be"" is good as is ""How Was I to Know"" although I would not have picked that to be the single off the CD. ""What do You Say"" is all right...I won't remember it years from now. All in all this is probably the best of her 90s albums besides ""For My Broken Heart"" which is Reba's masterpiece as far as I'm concerned."
2,THIS ONE WAS ONE OF HER BETTER 90s CDS,"Which isn't saying much because most of her 90s projects were all losers in my book. There are quite a few pretty ballads on here but they are ruined by faulty production. I agree that the best thing on here is ""We're All Alone"". I wish that different production had been used."
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!,"Again, Reba has captured the hearts of her faithful listeners all over the USA. With her heartwrenching lyrics, beautiful music, and a voice that is literally impossible to imitate, I must say that this CD is incredible. You arent a true fan until you have bought this wonderful new album by our favorite artist."
5,This music is great,"This is one of Reba's best ever. It takes alot for me to cry,but i sure did shed a tearon the song ""What do you say"".So you betcha this music will get 5 big stars. I will say this. You better buy a copy.ThanksJack EllisDCWCRITICS@onebox.com"
3,okay,"Now, I'm a HUGE Reba fan, Have every single album of her's(from 1979). ""So Good Together"" is not Reba at her best. The best cuts are ""We're So Good Together"", ""What Do You Say"", ""I'm Not Your Girl"" and ""She's Wasn't Good Enough For Him"". Take it from me, a Reba fan, if you wan't Reba at her best, get an earlier album."
5,"Reba's ""So Good Together""-- a must have!","Reba has once again risen above & released a great compilation or recordings! Although a few tracks (ie ""We're All Alone"" & ""Nobody Dies From a Broken Heart"") are a little dated, the overall mix of song types allows Reba to shine once more! If you are a Reba fan, you probably have already purchased this one, if not...you need to. And to those who aren't fans, you'd be surprised at the quality and entertainment found on ""So Good Together""!"
1,I'M SORRY,"I only liked ""We're All Alone"" and ""Before the War"" on this album. The rest of the songs are just ""there"" to fill up the space. I wish Reba would look back at her earlier stuff and realize what good melodies and good producers like Norro Wilson and Jerry Kennedy did for her. This is a sorry effort."
2,"HALF GOOD, HALF BAD","Out of the twelve songs on this CD half of them are good. The rest you can throw away. THe good ones: ""I'll Be"" (but this could have used a better arrangement), ""Roses"", ""I'm Not Your Girl"", ""She Wasn't Good Enough for Him"", ""Back Before the War"" and ""We're All Alone"". The worst two songs on here are the title track ""We're So Good Together"" (my ears hurt from the guitar licks) and ""Nobody Dies from a Broken Heart"" (one of the ugliest songs I've ever heard in my life!!! A good song will stand up with lyrics AND melody...not just lyrics!!!) I'll give this release 2.5 stars because half of it is good and the other half isn't. She could have released half a CD for half the price, couldn't she??"
1,TERRIBLE!!,"I only like one song on this travesty...""The Roses"". I don't know why Reba keeps cutting these terrible pop songs that don't do a thing for her. She's as country as they come and she needs to be recording real country!! This CD is terrible!!"
1,REBA'S LAST CD OF THE MILLENIUM IS UNMEMORABLE,"Most of the songs here are ballads of which there are two that I really like: ""Back Before the War"" and ""She Wasn't Good Enough For Him"". The rest of the stuff here is unmemorable."
3,All around great album,"This is another one of Reba's great albums. Being a huge fan of Reba's I think they are all great of course, but this one is exceptionally good. She shows alot of emotion in all of the songs, and has gotten alot of great reviews for this album. This is a must have to add to your cd collection. Excellent!"
5,"Well ""I'll Be""!",She's done it again! I can't believe how amazing this woman is! She has managed to find 12 amazing songs and she releases them on an Enhanced CD to boot! Reba never stops giving to her fans and it shows! The CD is great from start to finish!
1,MORE POP PLEASE!!!!,"Reba loves doing this type of material. Or maybe its her record company that thinks this is the only thing that will sell for her. In reviewing this album, it does have a couple of traditional sounding songs on here but not enough to quench our thirst for her return to real country. I believe that Reba has a great range but the choice of material to expose that range leaves something to be desired. As is evident in most of the songs on this Cd, her range is not explored fully or adequately because the material is not as good as it could have been for her. Too much spice in anything is bad and Reba is losing something in the mix here. This is particularly evident in the uptempo material. But for those who like pop music, this offering will have the right amount of spice!!"
2,SALTY,This is just some more of Reba's delving into contemporary music. She has lost so much of her appeal to me because everything she does is so overdone. I like it simple and nice. Chateaubriand and caviar are not my style. Caviar is too salty for me and this is what this CD is....salty.
2,I'd Skip This One..........,This effort is so mediocre...though not as bad as most of Reba's latter 90s material. There are a couple of songs I like on here...and I'll give the Cd two stars for those two songs. The production values are over-the-top here for material that is inferior by all counts.
5,So Good Together,Reba's the best! This release had several songs that really took me back in time to some great memories. One song even made me cry. It's a great cd!
5,She's back in business!,"I've been a fan of Reba's in 1992. Up until this album I thought that ""Read My Mind"" was her best work yet. This album ""So Good Together"" shows once again that Reba is the greatest female artist of all time. Songs like ""till I said it to you"" and ""Roses"" she blends in the ""old country"" sound, and mixes it with a more updated tone of the country music today. She puts feelings in her singing that makes you feel as if you were in the song. I've been to a couple of her concerts and she has a show that no one can duplicate. The energy she puts into her stage presence shows why she is the best. I can already see her getting many awards with this album. Reba's A#1 as well as this album. Keep up the great work Reba!"
2,A MIXED EFFORT,"I can take this or leave it. The first song is so terrible that it almost made me want to throw the CD in the trash. ""So Good Together"" was just plain awful. Loud noise..that's all it was. But things got a little better. Some of the songs on here are pretty good. They are mostly ballads the best of which are ""Before the War"", ""Roses"", ""I'm Not Your Girl"" and ""We're All Alone"", a cover tune done with some Mexican guys by the name of Jose and Durval. That last one is actually very, very good!! Overall this Cd is a mixed effort that could have used more imaginative production."
4,Saffire the Uppity Blues Women Strike again,"Man!!!!! What fantastic album. Even if it is a compilation album, it rates right up there with their previous ones. They need to keep on going with some more in the futureThere is only one thing wrong with this ablum. It does not have the song ""Cold Pizza and Warm Beer"" on it. This one of their classic songs. That is why I gave a four star rating instead of the top five."
4,Sassy Saffire -The uppity blues women,"I first saw saffire at the NY State Blues Fest in Syracuse, N.Y. I've loved them since then. This disc is one of their best. Combination of folsky blues, jazz, and creole type rhythems belnd perfedctly with their incredible lyrics. This disc has turned a lot of non-blues people in Saffire fans includsing one group of women who calls themselves ""THe Silver Beaver Club"""
5,Good stuff,"I love to keep some of this in my cupboard because first of all, my family loves it and secondly, it gets a giggle each time I show anyone. I grew up with this dessert in the UK and thought nothing of the name till I moved to the USA....makes me giggle now too....ha ha"
3,A.....W A Y....T O....S T O P.....E A T I N G.....T H I S.....P U D D I N G,"If you find this stuff TOO delicious, and can't stop eating it, my suggestion is to read: ""The Voice in the Night"", a short-story by William Hope Hodgeson. I can practically GUARANTEE you will NEVER want to eat Heinz Spotted Dick Sponge Pudding, 10 ounce can, pack of 6, (or any other size), after reading this story, ever in your life again!Instead, have something healthy and wholesome - like Tuscan Milk! : )"
3,Makes me giggle,"No idea what this tastes like, it's just a running gag with my family - someone gets one every year in their stocking for Christmas :).It kinda scares me."
4,Nothing that a dose of penicillin can't cure!!!,Are they kidding? Who would name a product this? Really!!! Love the part about preventing it from spurting...LOL!
5,What's so Funny?,"British food is often poorly regarded by comparison to the cuisine of our European neighbours: France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Yet in some areas Britain truly leads the world - where would we be without the sandwich, for example?Another area of British culinary pre-eminence is the steamed pudding, amongst which the Spotted Dick is king. As a pudding-fan, I am deeply saddened that several, rather puerile, reviewers find this name mildly amusing. I doubt they would stoop to such pathetic attempts at humour if they had bothered to taste it first.Take my word for it: nothing tastes better than a mouthful of dick, especially if it comes with a load of hot custard."
3,A fun treat!!,"Not a pudding by American standards. But then again, the name itself is somewhat obscene by American standards. I found this treat very very sweet, and it has been a long long time since I have seen bread in a can. It tasted much better heating in the microwave and then pouring some cream or half and half on top.I give this out as a gift for Christmas and birthdays, and almost everyone loves it!!! But don't give it to anyone at work or where there is an HR department - I learned the hard way."
3,I've had better....It was a bit short on flavor,"I am not a fan of raisins, fruitcake or any of that stuff but I just had to know what Spotted Dick tastes like so I bought one. It wasn't as bad as the name or the picture on the package would suggest...but it wasn't exactly great dick either. I could see this going well with tea or a strong alcoholic beverage. Overall this dick wasn't particularly good or bad but it isn't something I will be rushing to eat again. It's a bland, spongy cake with fruit in it and it didn't taste particularly bad or good.The can is good for a laugh if you are a slightly (ME!) immature American! I am sure some American words and names are quite funny in England too. Whatever the case may be, if you are feeling randy go grab yourself a can of Heinz Spotted Dick. If you are into Spotted Dick you may find this stuff very satisfying!"
1,this product is dangerous,I ordered the spotted dick. After eating I felt a little strange. I went to the bathroom and to my horror realized that I had this horrible disease. Luckily 1 gallon 128 Floz Tuscan Whole Milk cleared this up for me.
2,pretty extreme,"I bought this book thinking it would be a realistic guide to what I could buy at the store. Problem is, according to this book, nearly everything at the store is toxic/unhealthy in some way. After several years of trying to feed my kids the perfect diet with few additives, I have loosened my standards, because it is just too expensive and they often don't like the ""pure"" foods. And if you really don't have time, cooking everything from scratch is simply not an option, contrary to what the title of the book says. The fact is, eating will kill you eventually, and so might a car/bus/airplane/fall outside your door."
3,A good adjunct product,"I will use this video as an adjunct to other presentations regarding No Child Left Behind in a class on school social work. It is not very meaty, but interesting for students who may be disinclined to read required texts."
2,ok but not what it promises,just doesn't really do anything---the reviews written on this product where great but my daughter didn't like it so hot
4,diary,"This was an exciting gift for my granddaughter, she is loving it.great price and fast shipping."
3,diary with older brothers,"Really cute concept, but the older brothers figured out, real quick ,that a regular magnet would open the diary.Younger sister was not too happy."
1,"Please, buy this book!","I know GeorgeAnne Smith.....She is a Mojado that gave all her money to the Rashneesh, now she lives in a one room trailer in Northern Oregon......Her window overlooks the communal wash area. GA (as we call her, can only pick watermelons during the season, and that is her food source, along with buying from the dollar menu, and McDonald's discards.This book is truly a metaphor for our sexual history"
1,Do not buy it,The picture and quality is not as I viewed it prior to my purchase. Item delivered was cheap looking and grainy. It is as if someone took a picture of a picture 1000 times. Buyer beware. The subjects in the picture is distorted which make the picture look so fake. I appreciate the price but not the product.
1,Expensive propaganda,"Even though I think the Author is right about some of the facts mentioned in his ""book"" (only 52 pages long!), the book gives no tips, no solutions, no fresh ideas that might help anyone at all.Grain Damage is just mere propaganda were the author complains meaninglessly for 52 pages.On top of that, each page is divided into three sections and only the middle one is filled with text: the other two are filled with uninteresting phrases about grains or fruits.Definitely not worth what the price AT ALL."
3,An Important Message Told in Too Many Pages,"Dr. Graham has a compelling and important message, but it's told in too many pages--there's redundancy and belabored points--I got the feeling he was really stretching so he'd have enough for a booklet. And this is good to remember--it's NOT a book, it's just a 38-page booklet. He could easily have said the same thing in less than 10 pages, as a white paper--but then, where's the profit in that? SO, even though I was glad to get the help, I felt a bit cheated--there just wasn't 38 pages of information."
5,De Camp is a wonderful read.,"L Sprague De Camp created the Krishna series, of which ""The Prisoner of Zhamanak"" is but one example, as a modern version of Edgar Rice Burrough's Barsoom tales. Drawing on his own vast experiences of travel in the Middle East, De Camp creates a more practical view of another world, and a vastly entertaining one. De Camp's sly sense of humor shines through every page of the entire series.This volume deals with a Terran diplomat, trying to rescue a Terran Anthropologist from a paranoid local king.Every fan of Golden Age Science Fiction should have the complete Krishna Series on his bookshelf.The Hipster gives it a Thumbs Up!"
3,Doncha Love a Man in Uniform?,"Well, Gable's in one here--but it's from the Salvation Army! For a change of pace, Gable is the ""good guy"" alternative for Joan Crawford, who has nearly committed suicide over playboy Neal Hamilton (aka Commissioner Gordon from TV's Batman). Through the healing love of gentle Clark, Joan gives up her wilder ways and joins the Salvation Army too, but when she meets her old flame Neal again, will she be strong enough to resist? Try it simply for the novelty--but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!"
4,Very good,"If you're already a Ministry fan, you'll like this album. Not their best work but very good. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. There aren't any tracks that I would consider ""killer"" (except maybe No W). Some are a little weak. I'd probably give it three stars if I weren't already such a fan.P.S. Their live show is awesome. Only then can you get the true Ministry experience."
3,Just getting started...,"In what will probably be the first of a Jourgensen Bush Bashing trilogy, Mole' serves up some pretty good listening. If you can tolerate all the extreme left wing cliche's, you'll find this is one of Ministry's stronger efforts. Jourgensen's views may be so far out there as to be comical, but hey, their hyperbolic nature is a perfect match for the music.That being said, this album is really just a warm up for the next CD, the blistering Rio Grande Blood (easily their best work since Psalm 69). If you don't have Rio Grande, get that one first."
4,back from the depths,"Al has finally come around. Gone is the slow, heavy mud that was ""Filth Pig"". Al is back with speed, chest pounding beats, and most importantly, samples. Sure, it's not quite as clean as ""Mind.."", but this is the stuff that made people like Ministry in the first place. I mean, let's face it, ""Filth Pig"" and ""Spoon"" did not attract new followers; all those albums did was irritate the old ones. The sound of this album is closest to ""Psalm 69"". As for the whole political statement, I think it's kind of silly, but I could really care less. Al could sing about unicorns and rainbows, and I probably wouldn't know the difference, as long as the music is there. Al's political views are only clear when you read the lyrics. Yeah, W is a moron, okay, we get it. If you like W, and you like Ministry, buy the album anyway."
5,Gave up? Give In!,"i've liked the ministry albums for a long time and even their last couple of albums. sure, they've seemed to have quieted down a little and wasn't like the ones you've loved. well, they're back! like others have reviewed...as soon as i heard the first track i thought, ""hrm, sounds like the psalm 69 album"". well, i've got great news! if u liked, ""a mind is.."" and ""psalm 69ish"" type music they've previously recorded then u'll love this!!!! i have no idea what the other missourian was talking about. this is totally different than the new skinny puppy (which i loved also), but the new skinny puppy is more technoish if u will. either way, a total recommendation!"
5,Ministry is BACK,"This is the Ministry that I've been waiting to hear for a long time. Not since Psalm 69 has there been such a good CD from this group. Alan's vocals are as harsh and to the point as ever and the music is never dull or boring. I loved all of the sampling they did in this release. They're very ""anti-politics"" here as I know they have been in the past, but this is so in-your-face that it doesn't slip by un-noticed. I just bought this album yesterday and I've listened to it 5 times. I know a good album when it grabs my attention like that."
2,loud yet feeble,"This album earns 2 stars for simply being good ol' Al and his loud guitars. Paul Barker's absence is obvious while not devastating. I have been a fan for about 5 years, but I see no reason to be ""loyal"" to any band, if loyalty means giving them your money for every album they release (not even including going to concerts). In my opinion Al should have quit while he was ahead. He was really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. For example, he uses very unoriginal and common liberal political sentiment, causing me to really question his sincerity on this album. The lyrics don't say much in the way of artistic thought or sincere feelings alike. I listened to a friend's copy of this and have yet to buy it myself. I doubt I will. I'd rather listen to Twitch or Greatest Fits or an artist who's still going strong, Raymond Watts."
3,It is bad business for entertainers to politicize.,"It has always been my opinion that a band like Ministry hates the government in general. Not shocking, this is one of the reasons they are so hardcore. When they embrace or disgrace political elements, however, they lose their hardcore status and get downgraded to propagandists, hardly what a musician should strive for. They are alienating half their fanbase, is that really what they want? I have always liked Ministry, however, like so many foolish acts as of late, they have lost my respect. Just shut up and play."
3,al attempts to be politically adept...,it's too bad al didn't use his brain while crafting his lyrics. spitting out ad hominem attacks laced with bleeding-heart liberal rhetoric is hardly original or even amusing... it's just ignorant. it would have been nice to hear some creative and original dubbing and lyricism instead of opportunist pot-shots. ignore his retarded lyrics and listen to the noise. it's not bad. i guess he should have stayed stoned.
2,yawn,"boring..drums suck...too fake...AL said this was going to be a ""punk rock record"" well buddy punk doesnt involve synthetic sounds...sorry...this album is a very big let down...get over yourself..wheres the music at? theres no love in this record. boring dumb stupid pointless waste..Skinny Puppys record was 100 times better. see you all on the other side."
2,Cds are good; book is okay,"The Cd's I found to be very useful.Read the book and follow the instructiosn.Would suggest that you load onto an iPod and make some play lists.I've been doing playlists of 33 songs (11 minutes), first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening."
3,Stans OK,I found the doll to be ok...nothing too surprising about it. The hat does fall off awfully easy...its good for beginners!
3,B'way The American Musical so-so,"The first three discs were only OK. I had forgotten how much better the later Broadway musical recordings were. The last two discs were very good, maybe because I could relate better to the shows or perhaps the productions were better."
3,"Fun, but...","This was a fun, well done movie, but we spent much of it wondering why so many things had been changed/left out/added from the book. Evidently Sir Terry approved of the changes, but we didn't understand them. Worth a watch, but don't expect the book on film."
5,<3 Pratchett,"This was one of my...well at least top five favorite Pratchett novels, so maybe I'm biased, but this is a super-fun movie. It's very true to the world and to the characters in the book. It's a family movie. Good for Pratchett fans of course but also for those who're unfamiliar with the world as well because the themes explored in the book/movie are relevant regardless of setting. It's sweet, funny, and light-hearted. Love love love"
4,great interpretation of classic Pratchett,"i'm an avid Pratchett fan, and prolific complainer about books being made into movies. this satisfied me in a way paper made indo cellulose never has."
5,One of the Best,"Without exception, I have found the Terry Pratchett's Discworld books to be fantastic, and this is one of his best. The book takes place mostly within Ankh Morpork, and even though it doesn't revolve around the city watch, you don't have time to notice the lack of Vimes and his cohorts. Excellent! After reading the book, be sure to check out the movie as well:Terry Pratchett's Going Postal [Blu-ray]"
3,Mucked about a bit too much?,"Part of the problem of watching any movie based on a book is what's left on the cutting room floor. In the case of Terry Pratchett's Going Postal, it seems to be a good 60% of the humor. Likewise, They do quite a bit to damage the continuity of any potential sequel in regards to Sgt. Angua (who never appeared as such in Going Postal, but was a nice addition nonetheless.). Losing much of the wit and charm of the novel, and adding several sequences that more or less grind salt in the wounds, the movie adaptation comes across as a far harsher story than it need be.Still, overall production is rather nice, visually appealing, and well acted. I'd love to see this cast return for a hopefully closer adaptation of the equally witty Making Money."
1,Nonsense,"I bought this movie because I love David Suchet. I made myself watch about thirty minutes thinking it would have to get better, it didn't. Save your money and don't buy this terrible movie."
5,"A great Pratchett film, and a great Blu-ray","Of the three live-action (UK Sky1 & Mob Film produced) films made of Pratchett's Discworld novels thus far (Hogfather, Colour of Magic, and this one), this is the strongest and best made. Though Hogfather has a lot a charm (and I wish was out on blu-ray), it, nevertheless, suffered from similar directing and editing problems that would sadly hurt Colour of Magic as well. But Going Postal, under a different director, seemed to me, to be wholly better made, in particular regards to timing, editing, and actors as they were placed to their roles. It was enjoyable, fun & funny, captured the book well, and more than worth it.It looks brilliant on the blu-ray, and the inlcuded features are fun too.As a passionate fan of movies, blu-rays, and Terry Pratchett, I was completely satisfied with Going Postal."
5,Very Good Terry Pratchett Book Adaptation,"This is a very good, but not perfect, adaptation. The cast is great. The set are outstanding! It is very fun and looks great. Watch the backgrounds for little things the set crews added that are quite fun for the Disc World fans. Only a hardcore Disc World fan will find a couple of the nuances from the book are missing in the movie. Otherwise, ADD THIS to your collection of Disc World movies- such as Hog Father, Colour of Magic/Light Fantastic."
2,"By far one of my favorite stories, but...","I love Going Postal. It has to be the funniest and one of the most insightful parodies of new technology since HG Wells!This movie has nothing to do with that book. It's not a bad movie, but it is the most ham-handed adaptation possible. At first, I thought they were going for campy, but then decided somebody must have felt it necessary to dummy down the story.And that's a damn shame. The movies made of Hogfather and The Color of Magic stayed true to the novels and were witty and funny and brilliantly entertaining. This could have been. With the talent on board for this movie, it should have been great.Don't know who was thinking what, but next time - don't mess with the story! You're not going to get better than Pratchett!"
4,This one delivers.,"My wife got me hooked on Terry Pratchett's work and since seeing ""The Hogfather"" we've been waiting for more of his work to be made into quality movies. While this one does not quite capture all of Sir Pratchett's sometimes subtle humor it is a very good and entertaining movie. The movie is well paced, good and long and the characters are well developed and played. Buy it, rent it, but make sure you don't miss this one."
2,Much more,"i have followed the pioneers from way back; this album is good but not the best.it does not qiute reflect their best performance. I recommend the album entitled : ""I Believe in Love"". find this album if you can, its worth yr money."
3,Read for completeness--not his best,"Art & literature provided Jung with data with which to correlate his model of the psyche. Furthermore, they provided the means for his presentation of profound observations of human nature & behavior. This is not my favorite volume of the collected works, but it is interesting. Read volume 18, The Symbolic Life for more information/observations on these topics. My favorite quotes in this book are:p. 4 Nothing exerts a stronger psychic effect upon the human environment, and especially upon children, than the life which the parents have not lived.p. 14 (quoting Paracelsus): `His motto is said to have been alterius non sit, qi suus esse potert (Let him not be another's who can be his own).'p. 47 Doubt alone is the mother of scientific truth.p. 60 Human instinct knows that all great truth is simple."
3,"There's potential, but it's not realized","There were some interesting ideas in this book, but I thought that it fell far short of its potential. The writing was mediocre at best, the characterization bland, and there were too many plot holes to make it a really enjoyable read. I was also annoyed by the way that Sherman seemed to discard most of the faerie ""lore"" that has become accepted in the world at large (and by this I mean like folk-tales, not rules set forth by other fantasy writers) but she didn't really create her own either. I spent most of the book confused about the societies of the faerie creatures.The potential for a good story was there, but the ideas, characters, and world needed to be better developed for it to work well. I would only recommend this book to Sherman fans"
2,Not very hepful,"The book is not very helpful. I used it in my first Probability class, and it isn't written in a simple and understandable way. The author jump from one section to another and then return. I had some knowledge in proof, and I was able to understand. The majority of the class only had Calc 2, and for them some parts were simply another language.Also, it has some terrific typos!"
3,A hard book to digest,"As a statistics graduate, I found it hard to understand this book. There are not many friendly examples to help the readers to understand the concepts, even with the help of solution manual. There are some mistakes too."
3,Could've been beter...,"I bough this tape in the hope of being motivated by something different. I was surprised that the dance moves were actually pretty good. However, the lack of good music to put the moves to quickly de-motivated me and a couple times I actually found myself turning it off before the segment was done. This would be a good video for beginners, or for people who don't mind doing funky dance moves to a soundtrack that consists of mainly steve talking and elevator music."
5,THIS ALBUM IS THE BOMB,I really enjoyed this CD. It is Pop with a definite Latin feel to it. Enrique sings with such emotion it is hard not to feel what he is singing. One of my favorite tracks is Oyeme. IT IS HOT! The man can write songs as well as he can sing them. I hope he has plans for more English albums. This one is really a nice change from a lot of Latin pop artists.
2,"""could i have this kiss forever"" not the proper version","I sampled this CD prior to purchase and was misled of course, I did not know it at the time or I would not have wasted my money). The version of ""Could I have this kiss forever"" on the CD is slow, morbid and horrifying to listen to--THE ONE ON THE SAMPLE WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT--AND MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE. The 2 versions therefore do not match, which is very misleading to customers. Amazon offers the option of sampling songs prior to purchase so as to inform customers of what they can expect to hear upon purchase. In this case, however, that did not happen, which is very deceiving. When selling music, the seller should make certain that the song samples match the actual songs on the cd, so annoying situations like this do not occur. Dissatisfied customers lead to zero profits."
5,"Fab sound, quik delivery..","I received this cd fairly quickly...in about 5 days with basic shipping and when I read this seller's info on this cd they claimed it was like new, but when I got it I was a bit skeptical that it would play because the back of the cd looked as though they tried to buff out scratches with some sort of machine...it does play though...EXCELLENT in fact. And for the price...amazing deal! -Lily_like_the_flower@yahoo.com"
5,I love Enrique!,"This CD is great! It's my favorite. I went to Enrique's concert last night in Houston and he rocked and he looked so hot! He opened with ""Oyeme"". He also sang several others from this CD including ""Sad Eyes"", ""Be With You"" & ""Baliamos"" and of course ""Rhythm Divine"" as his closing number, but I missed it because I got in trouble for videotaping. Anyway, this CD is the best! Go get it!"
4,Good1,Enrique Iglesias is definately the best performer of Latin pop today. His voice is amazing. His songs are cathy. I especially love Be With You. This young man has a lot of talent and i think he will be in this buisness for a long time.
5,For those who have doubt.....,"When Enrique Iglesias came out a few years ago and took Latin America by storm, I was personally not impressed with his music. This past summer with ""Bailamos"" I began to take note of his music and sound. With the release of the next single ""Rhythm Divine"", I knew I had to buy this CD. Well the album has great sounds from start to finish. For all those Whitney Houston fans out there, she is on this album as well. I recommend this album for everyone, especially for those who have doubt. For those new to Latin American sounds, give it a try.....as my mom would say ""you may actually like it""....."
5,From the moment I first heard Enrique....,"knew my heart would not be free. Have to hold it in my hands now, there can never be another album for me.I admire Enrique's neverending passion in his music. Each song has a true latin feel combined with rhythms that allow his emotions to come through and grip every heart and soul it reaches.Some songs sound somewhat similar in tempo and rhythm. 'Sad Eyes' isn't all that great. The duet with Whitney Houston is so so. That's all I find plain about this album. Overall, it's just awesome man! He's passionate, honest, and I wish him great success."
4,Duet Heads Up Great Album!,"This cd is great. I'm not the biggest Latin fan in the world, but I enjoyed songs like ""Rhythm Divine,"" ""I Have Always Loved You,"" and of course, ""Bailamos."" The BEST SONG on the entire album is a duet with Whitney Houston called ""Could I Have This Kiss Forever""! Oh my goodness, this song is a definite hit. I understand it will be available on Whitney's forthcoming Greatest Hits album. This song has it all. It's beautiful, sexy, powerful, and catchy. Great cd overall (didn't care for the spanish versions at the end however)."
5,Fantastic CD! Just Divine!,"I really love this album. Every song is great, especially ""Sad Eyes"". His voice has many ranges. He sounds great and looks great. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Best I've heard in a long time!,"There isn't a song on this CD that isn't worth listening to. I bought it on a whim on a shopping trip and haven't stopped playing it over and over since. (It's on now in fact). A wonderful mix of spanish AND English lyrics plus a wonderful duet with Witney Houston. The music is very uplifting and upbeat at times and on other tracks, its melodic and very soothing. Whatever song is playing, you feel yourself moving with the music...I don't know how to salsa but it sure makes me want to learn! It's truly a beautiful CD. This is a CD worth every cent."
2,ENRIQUE LOVES HIMSELF MORE THAN HE LOVES HIS MUSIC.,"Why does this CD keep getting 5 star reviews?First ""Bailamos"" and ""Rhythm Divine"" are the same song! ....Even when they start on the radio I don't know which one is which until he sings the title.On ""Be With You"" he sounds like a wounded moose in heat....""I just wannnnnna beeeeeeee with yooooou"", moaning through his voice.The only song that shows any promise vocally and musically is the duet with Whitney Houston - ""Could I Have This Kiss Forever"".Otherwise between Inglesias and Martin...I say Martin has the upperhand vocally and dances better too.I recently saw Inglesias on the Today show performing and he trys to be so serious....Enrique you are just singing pop...anyway your dad Julio is much more talented.This CD is fair at best with run of the mill tunes....Whitney saves it with her vocals and range.P.S. Can somebody please tell Enrique to remove that mole from his face, its distracting."
1,crap,PLEASE!!>......whatever happened to good Rock 'n Roll. This (...)is forced down your throats by the music industry and radio stations and goddam TRL. Please open your minds up and realize what is happening out there.........
1,Top contender for worst pop album of 1999,"Due to agressive marketing campaign by his record company and management team and his fans, this cd will be a commercial success.However, this album is further proof that he can't sing a lick. The talented Whitney Houston reaches a career low with her participation in this cd.The correct rating for this cd is - 1,000,000 stars."
3,First catch his music in Spanish!,"After being blown away by Bailamos and Rhythm Divine, I decided to buy the cd. Much to my chagrin, the cd was not up to part w/ the other songs. In general the songs sounded all alike, and he tried to throw a few latin beats in the songs. Just throwing in a word, ""corazon"" or ""mi amor"" doesn't make the music, latina! really! That is what the crossovers try to do, make the new anglo crowd believe that it is latin music, just b/c they mention a few words that don't fit, in Spnaish. I was not too pleased with the songs on this album, some are quite revealing. I was happy w/ his prior Spaish cd, Cosas Del Amor, it is relaxing and beautiful. Pop is new for him, totally. I wish his luck, but I hope he remembers where he came from!"
2,Three Good Songs,"I bought the this album one night when I had a sudden, overwhelming urge to hear ""Be With You."" There are three songs on the album I like: ""Be With You"", ""Bailamos"", and ""Rhythm Divine"" - the most upbeat tracks. I didn't like any of the slow songs because ... unfortunately, Enrique doesn't have a good voice. ""Sad Eyes"", for example, is nice lyrically and musically, but performed by Enrique it is almost painful to listen to. ""Could I Have This Kiss Forever"" - the duet with Whitney Houston - starts off well, but progresses into a noisy mess. When I saw him on VH-1's Men Strike Back 2000, it only confirmed my very strong suspicion that yes, he's cute, but he really cannot sing."
3,"Enrique, go back to the Latin market!","This English crossover CD was OK, it's not all that. I don't think that this English CD is any better than Ricky Martin's. Enrique is still vocally challenged and sings with that overdramatic, panicky, constipated delivery that gets very annoying. He sings way too many uptempo numbers on this album,and that is not his strength. Why did he sing uptempo songs on the album when he can't even dance in his live performances? I find him to be an average performer on his albums but a very mediocre stage performer where his vocal and dancing limitations become very apparent.He clearly does not have the stage presence of a Ricky Martin or Marc Anthony and this is why he has not achieved greater success with this album than his Latin counterparts."
5,"Enrique, te quiero mi amor.","He is one of the greatest pop singers of today. His voice is a stimulant to my heart. I remember back in 1996 when I fell in love with my sweetheart and his first album(self titled), had just been released. Especially the track ""Experiancia religiosa"", which I have an anchor to from the first kiss my boyfriend and I had. If you are into romantic music with a beat, Enrique Iglesias is a must have. I also recommend his other albums, they're all great."
3,Average CD for an Average movie,"I thought that the movie was quite humorous at times, but like the CD was average at best. Unless you are a hardcore 1970's music fan, you wouldn't appreciate this soundtrack all that much. I, personally, bought this CD for the 'Call Me' remix by Emilia Mojello. I love the remix for the fact that it has a nice 90's rock-ish touch to it. Blondie's version was fantastic in its own time but now sounds dated. Other than these two songs, there are some great 70's oldies songs on here that are sure to get your date/ spouce/ girl or boyfriend in the mood for some sweet lovin'. heh. Despite my average review, I would recommend this CD."
3,nice but cheap,"I would really urge Cuisinart not to promote 'Stainless Steel' as a selling point, both the rack and hooks. I'm not saying they are not stainless but will point out a very cheap grade of stainless steel that has enough Fe content to allow magnets to stick anywhere to it. The rack really does look good, a brushed stainless finish and the welded seam is well hidden. The pot hooks are bare, I cannot even tell if there is a clear coating on them and bet if they get wet will rust easily. It is a nice enough rack and I guess priced competatively but don't buy it because it's stainless and the others are either plated steel or anodized aluminum because they are equally good materials if not better."
4,Pot Rack,This cuisinart pot rack looks great with our cuisinart pots and pans. It fits perfectly and is very surable. Good quality.
5,"""Beautiful rack"", that's what she said.","I bought this to hang pots over my kitchen sink. Very impressed at the gauge of this metal, very thick and robust. Cuisinart did a good job of hiding the weld location where the ends are joined, I can only make out a small bump. The only thing that could be improved on is hiding the mounting bolts after installation is completed. The chrome finish of the bolt and washer sticks out against the brushed stainless steel.Also, the height is 15.9"", not 5.9"" as Amazon describes. I was going to return it since this is mounted on a very low ceiling, but I'm going to modify the top bracket instead so it can mount to the ceiling instead of the wall."
1,Can't hang this rack,"There are three points at which this is supposed to attach to the wall. The instructions say all three need to go into studs, but the points are only about 6 inches apart. It specifically says to not use any other type of fastener, that it must go into a stud but then says to ask your hardware store if you need special hardware. It is ridiculous and unusable."
5,It does what its supposed to,Product arrived on sched. No missing parts. It mounted easily w/ 3 bolts. I bought the extra hooks and its loaded up. Using it in a small diner kitchen just to organize. E z to clean snd it looks good. I would but from this seller again
5,Sturdy high quality,"This product is high quality, easy to install, and looks great in my kitchen. I have two pots, 3 pans, and two lids hanging on this nicely. I needed to get some extra hooks to manage getting all those items up there."
4,Half Repackaged Musik,"After praising DG/Universal for their new ""Musik...Sprache der Welt"" series in a recent review, I must now criticize them for once again repackaging previously released, widely available product. The account of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, performed by soloist Sviatoslav Richter with conductor Kurt Sanderling leading the Vienna Symphony, is truly remarkable. However, this 1962 stereo recording has already been featured on at least two other DG releases -- a recent import title in the ""DG Originals"" series (see my review) and an old ""Musikfest"" title that paired it with his famous Schumann PC reading. In fairness, the 1956 mono performance of Beethoven's 2nd Symphony, with Sanderling this time leading the Leningrad Philharmonic, is making its CD debut. It is indeed a great historical reading, but surely there was a rarer gem hidden in the DG vaults to pair it with than this Richter 3rd."
1,Do not work for lefties,These scissors do not work for kids who are left-handed. My husband and I (as well as our 3-year old) tried them and for whatever reason don't work if you try to cut left-handed.
2,Do not work well,I usually like this brand of toys but I was very disappointed about this scissors. They don't cut well paper. It's very hard for toddlers to manage. I don't recommend it.
2,not really scissors...,more like plastic. Disappointed. They cannot really cut. Maybe for a two year old. But not for kindergarten or first grade.
1,Very Difficult to work with,"The scissors are very very difficult to works with. The plastic ""blades"" are slightly far apart and being plastic it was a torture to cut with. I was in pain watching my dd (2.8 yr old) struggle with those, and mind you she is otherwise great with normal scissors. I just thought to try the safer ones. Her friend who was just learning (3yr old) to use scissors just gave up, they were too frustrating. For young learners look somewhere else. Would not recommend."
4,Great but with minor annoyances,"Great series. The DVD has lots of deleted scenes which is good and overall i really enjoyed it. My only problem was that they edited the soundtrack and some of the scenes. It wasnt major changes but i had seen the original version before this so i caught them. The worst changes they made were not playing sexy boy and raining men. This really bothered me because these songs were well known to the QAF uk fans. But overall if you love the series and you dont have a regional dvd player to play the original british dvd's purchase this version, the show is still a grate show to own."
2,great show but ......,"I love the American version of QAF. Due to a touch of curiosity I decided to check out the original UK version. Again, the acting and story line was excellent. However, I found the final episode to be a complete disappointment and that is the reason this show gets a two star rating. Without spoiling the ending I will say the last ten minutes was more in the genre of Sci_fi and in my opinion ridiculous. It gives the viewer the impression that is was written at the last minute and was basically a patch job. Hence, the ending ruined the quality of the show. You therefore feel ripped off for spending this much money on a six episode dvd. Save your money and watech it on a speciality channel or wait for a sale on this product."
4,Video review,I enjoyed watching this video. It was interesting to compare it with the American version. I still like the American version better.
3,fails in comparison,"The original show from the uk that showtimes ""Queer As Folk was based on"". This show was on for 10 episodes where the american episode was on for 5 years. It should have not came as a shock that it failed in comparison and frankly it didn't. This show came off to me as being cheesy and rushed. The character that debbie was based on was played by an actress entirely too young to play his mother and because of that I found it totally unbelievable. Stuarts suppose to be some irresistible sex pot who has alot of money but yet he had bad teeth. I prefer the american version hands down. This may have given them the idea for a show but it was the writers and actors of the american version that took it and made it good. I saw this on netflix. I would never purchase it. Not unless it was for like 7 dollars or something to watch every once and a while for giggles at these chipper guys running around trying to be sexy."
4,What has the Negro cost America?,"Although reading the title, one might suspect this book to be racist, it has uncovered some very specific and thought-provoking items."
5,Namaste,"Combines my two favorite topics : Yoga and losing weight. Thought provoking book.I'm familiar with the writers from ""Yoga Journal"" magazine, and really enjoyed the book. Some drawings of Yoga poses included."
4,tasty tortilla strips,"Buyers be prepared to store 4 pounds of these strips. They taste great esp on salads. They DO NOT come in the clear container shown in the picture. When I opened my box I had a thin plastic sack full of the strips. Now I had to find a way to keep them all fresh. It took 3 large tupperware containers to store them all. Storage may not be a problem for restaurants that will use the item quicker than an individual family, like we are."
4,Another great and strange Depp movie,"This is off the beaten path, but another great movie for Johnny fans. It is not a mainstream movie, but should be viewed as an artistic piece."
4,"Covers MRI, NMR, PET, and others.","Section I: ""Imaging in Animal and Human models"" covers NMR and MRI using various lab animals.Section II: ""Imaging of Receptiors, small molecules, and protein-protein interactions"" covers 11 chapters including PET receptor assay, enzyme dependent fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, molecular imaging of enzyme function, mitochondrial NADH redox state etc.12 pages contain color figures."
2,A CD that's great for parties.,"This interesting CD collection contains short little samples of each song, cleverly mended together for a smooth output, perfect for DJ's. The songs are new stereo recordings, and some even sound better than the original recordings. (i.e. Hey Paula, When A Man Loves A Woman, A Thousand Stars, etc.) I made the mistake of thinking this was a CD with all the regular, full length versions on it, but it's still an OK CD collection.--Peter A."
1,"Carpal Tunnel, anyone?","I bought this to replace my Chi while I was living in Europe (the Chi doesn't come in 220v). It is as good (or bad) as any El Cheapo straightening iron you can pick up at Target. As many reviewers have noted, it tends to burn your hands as you iron. Worse still, you can't use any protective product (I used the Schwarzkopf Osis Flatliner Iron Serum and Toni and Guy's Iron-It Heat Defense Spray with my Chi with no such difficulty) - because it literally ""fries"" your hair, stinks terribly, and leaves gunky residue on the plates. Also, I found that I had to run the iron over my hair several times (my hair is wavy/curly, not coarse) in order to get it as straight and sleek as my old Chi.Save your $120 - you could get 1 T3, 1.5 Chi's, or 5 Conairs that would do a much better job than the Sedu."
4,Sedu Review,"This hair straightener is awesomeeee =)i never tried the other expensive ones, so idk if its betterbut I would totally reccomend it. and omg the shipping was amazinggit came soo quickly! after only 2 days I think and i got free shipping too! (:you gotta love amazonn"
3,Works Well until it shorts,"My sister, my mom and I have gone through 4 of these babies in the past couple of years. The biggest problem I have had with this product is around the 1 year warranty expiration date... the cord that connects to the straightener will begin to short around this one year mark. I use my straightener about 3 times a week. At some point I kept getting shocked by my flat iron (due to exposed wires), so I taped it with electrical tape, but now I have to position my straightener in a certain way so it stays on.This problems has only gotten worse over time and I am finally searching for a new one. I would recommend this product because it works well, but if you want to use this for a long period of time, look elsewhere. This problem occurred with all four of the straighteners I have had from Sedu."
1,Broke after one year exactly,"I was very happy with mine, but it broke right after the one year warranty expired. One day it was working, and the next, when I plugged it in, nothing happened. I've never abused it, was always very careful when I handled it, and always followed the manufacturer's instructions. A big disappointment!"
1,Worked fine for a while till it died,"I've only had this iron for about 3-4 months and it has already started giving me problems. It's fine as long as it works. I travel a lot so maybe thats what caused it, however, I expected something i paid 130 bucks for to last a little while longer. Now, every time i turn it on, I have to spend 20 minutes to put it in the exact position where it will actually stay turned on. Once it gets hot, and I start straightening my hair, it usually turns off (yes even if its turned on), so I have to continuously watch in the mirror to make sure the little green light is on.There was so much hype about this iron when I first got it so thats why I picked this one over the CHI. But come on for an arm and a leg, can't a girl get an iron that will actually WORK!"
1,Broken already!!,"After 3 1/2 years, I finally had to retire my trusty Chi. I did plenty of research and after all the rave reviews, decided to try something new and purchased the Sedu. It worked great... for about 6 weeks! It doesn't heat anymore, and I've never once dropped it. It came as quite a shock to me, considering the amount of money spent on the item! Hopefully it was just a fluke. There is a warranty, so I am hoping there won't be any problems with getting a new one. Wish me luck!"
3,Great ornament except light saber broke off within 2 days.,"This ornament is nice, except the light saber snapped off soon after we purchased it. I recommend this ornament only if it is going to be hung on the top of the tree where little hands cannot touch it."
4,"""Can you hear me now?"" PSP Headset","A nice piece of work. I personally bought it at EB Games, but you could wait until you can buy it here at Amazon. The sound quality is good, and the talking feature rules, but when faced with lag I was subject to a hissing noise. Maybe my product is defective, maybe not. In any case, it's super fun, and necessary to join clans /cells on such games as Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror, and Socom: Fireteam Bravo. A must have for the infrastructure PSP gamer!"
3,not for psp 2001,Sony changed the plug on the PSP with the 2001 series. The original plug is thicker and has three contacts on each side of the rectangular part of the plug (3.5mm headphone jack is standard on both). The new plug is thinner and has more contacts (5 or 6.. I haven't bought a remote). I too bought a headset for skype but found that it was only for the old PSP.
1,Do not buy !,"JUNK! My mic doesn't work at all. The other reviewer is the only person that i've heard of that it actually works. I've read alot about other gamers casque mics not working either. Do not buy! Save your money. It also doesn't tell you, you need the psp remote that comes with the more expensive psp box. So i wasted 40 bucks on nothing!"
4,Typical Kimball Collins mix,"typical american trance mix with a mixture of european and american tracks all spun up by Orlando DJ Kimball Collins. featured artists include Armin, Signum, Jon the Dentist, etc. Remixes by Moonman, DJ Taucher and others. O.K. but similar to many other trance mixes. I recommend checking out Ibiza Euphoria import mixed by Matt Darey (Lost Tribe)(on amazon)"
2,Not so exciting,"Although there is nothing pointedly ""bad"" about this cd, it just is not that exciting to me. I am not sure why it is so highly rated?!?!"
4,Kimball really knows how to spin,"Despite what that wanker Jared C says, Kimball really rips it up on the decks and definitely has his own style of trance. I recommend hearing him live if you ever get the chance."
4,Good cheesy trance anthems,"If you like intellegent progressive trance and not just anthems than this cd isn't for you. I myself don't just have to listen to great mixes by digweed and oakie or sasha. sometimes you really just wanna hear good tunes that mix well. This cd is good for what it is. Cheesy anthems. I love 'exodus' and ' lost in love' . Please don't piddle about with this cd if you like intellegent trance. This would be more of a cd to listen to if you were just gettin into techno and liked good catchy tunes. Its a beginner cd that people who don't know alot about trance or just techno in general say man that cd is awesome, where'd you get it. then you look at them like here have it. anyways the reason it gets a four is because the anthems are so enjoyable to listen to. So cheers."
4,4 stars. why?...,"I concur with everyone's comments. Believe it or not, (you're NOT gonna belive it but I'll tell you anyway), the first 12 seconds of track 8 (Future Mix) are hands down the best 12 seconds on this album. I honestly wish someone would extract the 'mixing' fx/beats found in this 12 second interval and pull it into track unto itself! I was hugely disappointed when they faded out after only 11-12 seconds. Other than that...tracks 1,2,3,4,6,8,and 11 are superb. Out"
2,yawn,"after reading several reviews of this album, and from talking to a friend about kimball collins' live sets, i was pretty excited to hear what this cd sounded like. i have to say that i'm not impressed. this cd is a homogenous mix of fast, standard trance 'anthems.' every song has the same form, and there's nothing really exciting about the mixing. on the whole, this is a pretty boring cd. there's a few standout tracks, like 'come on strong' and 'exodus,' but they're really not all that different from the other 10 songs on the cd. it seems as if any dj could have picked these same records and mixed this same cd. judging from this, i'll take sandra collins over kimball collins any day."
2,Disappointing,"Much shorter than expected. The acting was comparable to what I'd expect form a low budget porn flick. Based on the one review there was, I expected this to be, well more. No sex, which isn't a deal breaker by its self, but the story left off right where it seemed it was about to get started."
3,HITT MP3 Player review,MP3 is fine. FM reception is poor; too much static noise; could not get clear station unless you have to stand still. Controls are very confusing and the user manual does not help much.
4,"Durable, convenient mp3 player focused on Freedom !","Having read all previous reviews I have to add the following:More memory and/or a Micro SD slot, Shuffle Play, better FM radio reception& ear padding would be making this the utimate 'on the go mp3 player/radio'but then you'd pay much much more of course.I do think it is slightly overpriced.Yes it would be excellent if the 'Chinese' (most likely) knew better Englishand the manual was a piece of impeccable English literature,but with an iq of over 60 (lol) you can make perfect sense out of it.Very convenient. Fit for most activities.Easy controls but certainly not for the... 'electronically challenged'.And my battery is working fine so far and i've had it since august 2006,playing each and every single day.Durable, convenient basic mp3 player focused on freedom."
2,not impressed,"cheaply made import. As an example, the owners manual was written by someone with extremely poor sentence structure. ""Note: Once the player has finished playing all songs it will automatically repetition"", and ""The player will not play music while it is connecting to the PC"". The controls are not at all user friendly and they are confusing. Nice to be without headphone wires but that is the only thing I like about the product."
2,Great for about a month,"I was really impressed with this player, as if i wanted the world to know about this wireless, usb charge mp3 headphone player but after a month battery life cut out, will not hold a charge for more than 30 min. if they can fix this, these things will revolutionize your ultimate workout.***Update****I purchased another one that crapped out as well. USB is not recognized anymore and i have tried to plug it into many machines. After Zopid said they would exchange it, another service rep said they changed their mind. As much as i loved this product, its hard to let go but if they stop working on customers, then....i have no choice."
5,Been There....,"As a mother of two I completely understand where Alison is coming from. I've wished to run away at times too. This is a light, cheery, truthful story. Can easily be read in one sitting but the feeling behind it stays for a long time. Go on and call your Mom and say ""I love you"". Been there, done that....is there a T-Shirt? I highly recommend this book."
1,Wrong DVD format,"Could not play this DVD with Window Media Player, had to get some special program. Then also video is not good."
5,Very timely.,"The book came very timely and was exactly as described. What more can I say? I knew the book was older when I purchased it, but it was what I needed for a source for the virtual learning class that I am taking."
2,"Just buy the book, is much cheaper","Her book shows exactly how to do this, the movie is slow moving, so isnt really a daily help ."
2,You get what you pay for.,"For $25.99, this is not a bad deal, but be aware that the profiles for all three bits do not match up. You will have to do some extra work to get anything cut from these bits to match each other. For example: one bit has a rounded part and the bit that is suppose to match it, has a squared part.I just bought them, so I do not know how long they will hold up."
1,GAWD,Dont buy this! I got it thinking hey a no doubt tribute but i was so horrified when i put it in the cd player. Half the songs arnt even the correct words. The only good thing about this cd is the cover art.
1,can't stop laughing...,"Wow. I'm speechless after hearing this album...it is the poorest attempt at music that I've ever heard. I also find it funny that though every song is by a different band, all the women sound the same. Hm. There's nothing like the original- go buy the real stuff."
2,Oh the pain....,"If you like No Doubt, I recommend you don't buy this CD. I've loved No Doubt forever and I just bought this CD today. The only reason I gave this two stars, besides the fact I'm being nice, was for ""Simple Kind of Life"". It's the only well done song on the entire CD. All the other songs are horrible. Every singer sounds exactly the same and it sounds like music from a karaoke bar. Especially ""Hey Baby"", ""Rock Steady"", and ""Making Out"". Whoever sang ""New"" should've taken a look at the lyrics prior to recording the song because she obviously had never heard the song before.Yes, this CD is horrible and will totally annoy any No Doubt fan. If you can, listen to this version of ""Simple Kind of Life"" because it's actually really good. But by all means, write off the other bands as pure crap. And they didn't even cover ""Bathwater"", which actually could be a good thing. I don't want any cover band ruining my favorite song!"
1,I already knew,"I already new that no one, NO ONE could ever sing like Gwen or try to sound like No Doubt, but i wanted to see what this cd sounded like so i gave it a try. I kind of wish i hadn't because i just wasted minutes from my life that i can never regain. It is TERRIBLE!!! And that girl who tried to sing New should maybe have learned the words first before destroying my favorite song!"
5,Must buy,"This cd is super good. I may be an avid Garth fan, but when it comes to Christmas cds I am a lot more skeptical with my selections. Garth does a great job with his latest release, filling the cd with staple songs. This is a very good album and I would highly recommend it."
3,Just so-so,"I purchased this album because of the large number of traditional tracks on the album. I have to admit I was pretty disappointed. Garth, who can sing heartfelt songs with the best of them, fails to do any of that on this album. It's almost like this album was recorded in a day to remind people that Garth is still Garth, and not this Chris Gaines figure. To the extreme Garth fan, of course you are going to buy it. But for those who are in the middle and who are looking for better traditional albums: Vince Gill and Joe Diffie's Christmas albums are highly recommended."
1,"Get Beyond The Season, the first Garth Christmas Album","Being a Garth nut who LOVES the first Christmas Album, ""Beyond the Season"", I was thrilled to hear that Garth had a new Christmas album. I rushed out and bought it and OH MY GOD, what an AWFUL album. I was SO dissapointed! The new stuff on this album doesn't gel. Garth's country voice doesn't mesh well with the Big Band sound of these songs. It sounds like he ""called it in"". Also, he has RECYLED and rearranged many of the songs from the first Christmas album, ""Beyond The Season"". This album was a big dissapointment even for a BIG Garth Nut like me!"
3,Christmas With Family,"I don't usually like Christmas, but this album kind of touched me. Last Christmas my sisters and I sat cozy around a warm trash fire on the road in front of our home and enjoy the lovely, uplifting holiday tunes from this album. But then my father would come stumbling home from the bar late on Christmas Eve ranting about how much he hates everything. Then he would command us to make him dinner and turn the music off while he passes out while watching porn."
1,"Danger, Will Robinson, Danger",There are lots of good Christmas Albums out there. This is not one of them. Slick production values can never make up for lack of feeling.
1,Just a repeat!,"I was excited to hear that Garth Brooks had a new Christmas album available because I just love his last one ""Garth Brooks & the Magic of Christmas."" But when I compared the songs from that album and this new one, I was disappointed. All the songs are the same except for a few. After the comparison, I decided not to purchase this new one, otherwise I would have had two albums with basically the same songs. I do like the first one, though, and recommend it. The only reason I gave it one star is because of it being a repeat, not very original Garth!"
4,Need help in finding a song.,"I had a Garth Brooks Christmas CD that had a Hispanic song about a girl named ""Maria"". I thought that was the title of the song. Anybody know which album that was please let me know because I would like to find it. I thought that it was a good album. Thanks"
5,Garth Brooks never gets old!,"This is by far my favorite Christmas CD. I love Garth Brooks and he does not disappoint on this CD. Some new, fun songs as well as a few of the classics. A must have."
1,He's almost there...,"It is hard to believe that Garth would put out another Christmas CD. Oh, wait. No, it's not. All he wants for Christmas is to break the Beatles' album sales record. So, by recording a few more bland holiday songs, removing his previous effort from the shelves, and putting some of those *older* songs on the new record, he can have a new CD for the folks to buy and, thus, increase his number of records sold. Well, it's working. It's too bad Garth, whom I have enjoyed in the past, puts more effort into marketing than into his music."
1,Sounds like Bill Murray made a Christmas Album,Anyone who saw Garth forgetting the words and butchering Christmas carols on his TV special knows all they need to know about this turkey. Garth's singing on this cd reminds me of those old skits on Saturday Night Live when Bill Murray used to play the ultimate lounge singer. Maybe Chris Gaines will put out a Christmas album next year?
1,A Dog in the Manger,This CD proves once and for all that there is no level to which Garth Brooks won't stoop to make a buck. Do yourself a favor and give the money you would spend on this CD to some charity to help brighten up Christmas for someone who really needs it.
1,no stars,"gARTH bROOKS HAS PROVEN HE WAS IN COUNTRY MUSIC JUSTG FOR THE MONEY.I SAID YEARS AGO THE INDUSTRY WOULD PUSH THE HELL OUT OF THIS NO TALENTED SOB THEN HE WOULD BE GONE. NOW THIS ALBUM AND HIS FAILED WAL-MART DEAL SHOWS HE WAS ALWAYS A FAKE. NOTHING BUT A FAT LOP OF YOU KNOW WHAT. BY THE WAY, WHY IS HE SO SKINNY ON HIS ALBUM COVER? WE ALL KNOW HIS FAT AS PIG"
1,Disappointed with Garth...again,"I was extemely dissatisfied with this CD. There were a dozen of my favorite carols on this collection, but the manner Garth sings them is terrible. He fades in and out on so many of the songs, almost like he can't control the 'consistency' of his voice. Looking for a great Christmas CD?...Martina McBride."
4,Dropper works well,"I can't offer a scientific analysis of the vitamins themselves, but the dropper built-in to the bottle's cap works well, a strong advantage over the competition."
2,"Not as heinous as ""American Dream,"" but...","The glorious career of CSN together seems determined to end with a whimper rather than a bang. There are a couple of surprises on this one: Stills' ""Only Waiting for You"" has a yearning quality that would have made it a decent cut on one of his middle-period solo albums; and CSN's acoustic cover of ""In My Life"" is so lovely, you wonder why they don't just dynamite the whole boatload of cheesy sythesizers, oppressive overdubs, tacky Vegas-lounge arrangements, and get back to the acoustic garden where they belong. Stills' ""It Won't Go Away"" was a ripping inheritor to litanies of righteous anger like ""Word Game"" sung live and acoustic, but here, he plays it on electric rockstar guitar that's so overamped it sounds like a rider mower running over burlap bags. Here's hoping the next CSNY album is less used-up and overwrought than this."
1,don't waste your money,"i admit i'm picky, but with so much good music to listen to, why try to convince yourself you like something when it's really not any good. i wouldn't include any of these songs on a playlist and i'll keep the cd but don't plan to listen to it again. what's vexing is that you'd think this was a fairly good cd based on most of the reviews."
4,You may want to re-think...I did!,"My most recent review of this cd gave it 3 stars. This cd is not a great first-timer. When you get it, try to listen through a few times. After really taking the music in and considering it, you may find that it is better than you thought, for Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Songs of particular value include, ""Only Waiting For You"" (4 1/2 stars), ""Camera"" (4 stars), and ""Street to Lean On"" (3 stars). When I reflect on this cd, I now rank it as a keeper, one that i will listen to again and again. Email me your oppinions."
3,"ok, but definately not the greatest!","This cd is really just ok. it is honestly, not the best that they have prodeuced. Really. it is not bad, but if you want realy crosby, stills, nash, and young...try ""so far"" or ""thousand roads""(david crosby). This cd is not bad, but definately not one that i listen to a lot."
2,Heard better,"I'm sorry but it seems like there's barely any engery there. I love them a lot, but the earlier stuff was better."
4,The Hidden Crosby Stills and Nash CD,"I bought this album when it came out and tended to dismiss it at the time. It seemed too forced commercial to me, like their goal was to have a top 40 hit rather than make great music. I recently bought the CD and gave it another listen. I guess there is so little great music being made these days that ""After the Storm"" really sounds good to me given another chance. As others have said, it's not essential like the first album, CSN and Daylight Again but with CSN, even when it's not great, it's still pretty good, if you catch my drift. There are some uninspired songs here but also some great ones. ""Camera"" (nice to see Crosby and Stills share writing credit), ""Find a Dream"", ""Unequal Love"" are as good as anything from the past and I really love the groove on ""Bad Boyz"". No comparison between this and ""Live it Up"" (their true low point). This really is the forgotten CSN album, at least I'd forgotten it, but I am very glad to have rediscovered it."
1,HELP!,"The musicians who put together this album were very wise in not revealing their identities! I have listened to high quality 30 second clips of every song on this tribute, and it made me GIGGLE. I hate to be judgemental (particularly of something that I have not heard in 'whole') but this album is truly horrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody! The quality of the instrumentation, though correct for the most part, is that of a karoake track. The one place where it tempted me to chew my own foot off was the beginning of Warning- totally butchered. As for the vocals, they are amateur. The dude who sang on this sounds like a country singer on crack who hasn't warmed up. Tribute to Incubus has it's place on the shelf perhaps as a novelty item, but putting it in a CD player and listening to it would probably drive the boys of Incubus (or any human being) to sheer insanity!"
1,PATHETIC,"On a day that you're feeling like the most pathetic person alive, pop in this album and that feeling is guaranteed to disappear. This album is without a doubt the best way to give Incubus a bad name. I'd love to see Brandon's reaction to this."
1,A TRIBUTE????,"This album must be called: ""A Curse To Incubus"".The songs aren`t played right and the voice is terrible (and terrible is a good adjective).I give it 1 star cause in here you can`t give less than 1, but in my opinion this must be the worst cd ever in the history of the music industry, its a shame that the outstanding incubus material was destroyed like the way they did."
1,are you kidding me?,"i've listened to the clips for this cd and it's obvious why they don't even list the artists name who is ""attempting"" to sing these songs. usually a tribute is supposed to signify that other artists would like to pay homage to the musical ability of an artist. i sincerely hope this was not their intention here because this is a sham. i am a huge incubus fan and i wouldn't pay $.99 for this and if it was possible to give this ""0"" stars i would have. are you kidding me?"
1,Songs for the Deaf (tone deaf....),"I'm jumping on the bandwagon - this album is a waste! I cringed listening to the clips provided. The vocals sound as though they were recorded while the singer was in the shower (and that's not just from the poor quality of the clips provided). Tributes are supposed to be different perspectives on an existing song, not feeble attempts to perfectly recreate the vocal stylings of the original singer. The music behind the singer is not bad - not exactly Incubus but a little different flavor. However, that is all but subdued by the grating performance by the vocalist. Until an ""Encomium""-style tribute is released in honor of Incubus, stick with the original."
1,Ug,"A good comparsion for this is someone trying to pull a Jim Carrey, you can't do it, and you'll look like an idiot for trying. The musicians aren't too bad, but it's the singing that kills it. No one can dupilcate Brandon Boyd in any way. This guy doesnt have the same kind of voice, and he can't even sing so it sounds worse. He also emphasizes the little things Brandon will do with his voice. He sounds like a 40 year old guy who has never had any practice singing. He also does it at the wrong pace. I especially noticed this in ""Nice to Know You"". It's like he would stop and think of the lyric, then say it, but then have to catch back up, so he sings faster or something. I dunno, it's hard to explain on here I guess, just listen to the clip and you will know what I'm trying to say. To make it simple, this tribute sucks, but the real Incubus is awesome."
1,horrible,"i listened to the samples, the music was alright, but the vocals are what makes this album not worth your money"
1,stay away from this,ok ive just listen to the 30 sec. sample of the first 5 tracks and i dont know whether to laugh or cry...like people before have said...the music sounds fine but the voice is horrible...i could prolly sing it better. so yeah id pass on this
1,You've got to be joking!,"This is supposed to be a tribute! Not a CD made to humiliate and completely ridicule and mock the artist. If those weren't the intentions, I'm sorry it SOUNDS like it! Just to make it clear this tribute was not made just for any artist, but for Incubus. INCUBUS! Which in my opinion is one of the best bands around. This is not worth money, not even trash, stay far, far, far away from this. The star, which is completely redundant, let's just put it this way, I gave it one star too many. I don't know why money was even spent on the making of this CD. Do not purchase, unless you want to torture somebody. It'll just make you deaf I'm already deaf. I reiterate and hope you take my advice stay far, far, very far away from this. Just to come and think about it, this should bring a warning label, ""May cause listener to become a hearing impaired and may cause internal brain damage."" Think twice before you spend your money, it's better of being burned in your chimney this holiday."
1,um no,"I dont own this but have listined to the cclips on here, and the music sounds alright but the vocals sound like a bad Jack Black wannabe- INCUBUS DESERVES MUCH BETTER"
1,Dude............Where is my Incubus.,"If there was a dark side to the Incubus force here it is. It is your worst fear realized some one a group of guys who learned how to play and sing by watching Barny to make this record are making money while I actually have to work. While I was listening to the sound samples I was thinking hmm.. Looking at the title you think cool more Incubus till the next album...The village people could have done better, and I would have known to stay away. While I am no musical prodigy I can and have made better music playing in the garage. Oh and listening to the vocals made me want to go and gargle with warm salt water.In summary--Realize that this CD sux and listen at your own risk...friends don't let friends listen to bad(and I don't mean good!) Incubus ripoffs"
1,What the (beep) is this?,"I don't have the album, but all I had to do was listen to the clips provided on this site, and WOW! A very bad wow. Why was this even released? It sounds horrible. I love Incubus and they certainly deserve a tribute, but not like this. There's little talent, and the vocals will drive you insane. I try to have my respect for any musician, but this sounds like a joke or something. Do yourself a favor and get the real thing, there's nothing in the world like it..."
3,Decent but could have been better,"This is a good DVD, I'm very out of shape so it gets me sweating. With no dance background at all it's hard to follow at times, however with practice it gets easier. I love this DVD although I find the female instructor somewhat annoying. If you are just looking for a fun short workout, this is for you!"
3,Dirty Dancing at Home,A fun video overall. I had to watch the introduction a few times to get the basic dance moves down but I had fun once I got the hang of things.
3,Dirty Dancing Official Dance Workout,"This is a difficult video for anyone who is not used to dancing. Rather than being an aerobics workout, it is more like four dance lessons."
2,Nothing like the movie,I was looking forward to more moves like the movie and more music too. Was a disappointment. Was very cheesy
3,"Fun, but somewhat lacking","This DVD was fun, but is more of a dance instruction DVD than a workout DVD. It does not include any warm up or cool down and stretching which to me is its biggest disadvantage. The instructors are good and go over the moves well, plus there is a step guide if you need more instruction. The DVD is set up so you learn each dance individually and then can do all the dances back to back in a separate section of the DVD. The moves are fun and challenging enough to get you sweating, however you need to do all of the routines about 3 times through to get a decent cardio workout - but it's fun, a good burn. I love the movie, and this was a gift from my husband because he knows I love to dance. It is definitely a cute tribute to the movie - not the best workout DVD I own, but it's a fun alternative to just getting on the elliptical."
3,regular exerciser,"As a big fan of almost any kind of dancing and Dirty Dancing the movie, I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining. I am a regular exerciser and am always looking for a great workout. Let me tell you , you work a sweat with this. First, the instructors take you thru the individual steps - about 15 minutes , then you put it all together for the main dance (about 3-5 minutes). The next day I really did feel it all over my body, legs and arms. It is a nice change of pace and hopefully I am burning some mad calories without putting major strain on muscles. The music gets you wanting to watch teh movie and take syou back. I actually wanted to give this 3.5 stars but couldn;t figure out how to do that."
4,Dirty Dancing,"I've only done this workout once so far; so you can see my commitment to exercise. However, when I did it I thought it was a lot of fun. It's a little difficult to follow, and you need space. I think with practice it'll be easier. Definitely a fun activity."
2,such a disappointment,"First of all, the routines in the DVD is nothing like the dirty dancing movie, not at all.Second of all, the routines are very ordinary. I have tons of dancing DVDs, the routines shown in this one is nothing new at all.Lastly, the thing I hate most, is that the female leading dancer's stomach is so fake, that it looks disgusting."
5,Wonderful workout,I enjoy this workout and it was very affordable and very quick delivery. I was checking it out at the library and it is very nice to have my own copy.
1,Disappointin,This had hardly any dancing that is seen in the movie. The dancers are also pretty cheesy-just didn't meet my expectations.
2,fun but not for a beginner,"This video says it is beginner friendly and it is not at all. The syllabus was really good and did explain a lot of the steps at a good pace but when it came to the actual routines, they went way too fast. Very disappointed in this product."
2,Dirty Little Lie... Save your money for another workout DVD,"I purchased this DVD hoping that it would give a full 30 minute workout as well! Unfortunately once you run through all of the song titles-- you've only gained about 15 minutes of workout. Very disappointed. I would save my money to purchase another workout DVD, turn off the sound to that one and turn on the soundtrack to Dirty Dancing if you really want to dance to the music!"
3,"Good idea, bad follow through","I was excited to finally get this in the mail! I love this movie and really needed something fun to workout to since I have decided to get into shape. I love the ideas of using the original soundtrack and some of the moves that were used in the movie, but the instructional part of the routines didnt manage to get into the DVD. There is a small area to learn each move and what it is called for about 2 seconds for each move, and thats it. When actually doing a routine to the music, the counts are off, and even the dancers in the background keep messing up due to the bad leadership of the so called ""instructors"". You'd be better off just doing your own routine to each song.overall, I like the concept, but the people ""teaching"" you how to do the steps are a joke."
2,"Fun concept, but difficult to follow","I am neither a novice nor an expert. I've done some basic ballroom and a fair bit of swing, and I've got a few years of aerobics under my belt. I found this video went way too fast to follow competently, even after doing the intro a few times. The instructors are fun to watch and they are very talented dancers, but over and over again, I found myself thinking, ""Do they think I'm a professional dancer doing this workout?"""
3,annoying,"I liked tha music but my God are tha dance teachers in it annoying, not so much tha guy but tha girl. I was hoping id enjoy it more but once u can mute them and just dance to tha music it's ok. I'm not sure if id even recommend this.."
1,so mad,I am a big fan of the movie and i was overly excited when i saw this. i got it and my favorite song is not on here. There's maybe 3-4 songs and it's very boring.
5,Devoted to the Art of Photography,"In this book, Erickson proves that his ability to tell a story is not limited to tales for children, but the real jewel is in the work of Bill Ellzey. I first met Bill as a young teenager, and new even then that he saw things that other people did not see, and that he could get what he saw onto film. As we drove across the hot Texas Panhandle in his blue Dodge (with the windows down!) his dimples danced and shown through an already graying beard, and he began to teach me how to ""see"" like an artist. Bill's photographs will remind you of what you have seen, or let you see what you always hoped was out there somewhere. Enjoy this book, and let Erickson tell you tales, while Ellzey lets you see the indescribable. What a great combination these two boyhood friends have become!PS: Bill, I'm sorry that I didn't have enough sons to name one of them Ellzey."
2,Didn't fit,I bought this particular brand because it is the same brand as my toilet. It did not fit. Not good.
4,"Great camera for the price, ease of use, and fun.","This is a great little camera for general use. The film is quite cheap (about $2 a roll, cheaper in a multi-pack) and loads with a simple drop in. Its a lot of fun and easy to use. Although photo experts may scoff at the picture quality,k this camera is great for kids (who don't have lots of money), it's also something so inexpensive that its no biggie of your kid loses it or breaks it. The picture quality isn't bad, but this isn't a camera for really important pictures or high quality."
3,nostogic...even....,"hey, I don't own this model, but I have a little Kodak Winner 110 camrea, and I just recently bought a Bell & Howell 35mm. I finally dug out my 110 and bought the first rolls of film for it in years. even though the film is kinda hard to find sometimes, and the picture quility isn't as good as the 400 speed Kodak film I shoot in my 35mm, it's still alot of fun to play with during good sunny days, mainly cause I'm too cheap to look for flash bars for it.I'm hoping someday to buy a Nikon but one can only wish at the moment."
2,the grip is not good,"As I said in the title, I dodn't like the grip of this darts. Ok ... I'm not a pro, I'm an average player ... but still ... I don't like the grip. It feels like if the dart sticks to your finger."
2,Review Response,"Very disappointing, as was Hooked on Swing. I was expecting the quality of Hooked on Classics, but neither one was even close. I'm donating both."
3,"Wolves, school buses, pregnant women, and flowers","These photos are 'quiet' but intriguing. The lightings in these photos are amazing. Sometimes it is hard to believe that these are photos and not drawings.I personally like photos/movies shot under low budget -- and these settings were certainly not cheap -- but if you don't mind that, this is good book to have."
2,Self Absorbed Nonsense,"Redundant, appropriated, and trite imagery. These are technically slick images, but the subject matter is quite immature. What is all the hype about? After a few images they all seem the same. These images are ridiculous. Is the artist a teenager?"
1,How disappointing,"There are artists whose images evoke a sincerity that is missing from most of these images. These photographs seem forced, overly contrived, pretentious, and redundant.Look at what the photographer George Tice can do with light and the landscape. A photographer, an idea, and a camera. How simple, how sincere."
2,Cold & distant. Quintessential NYC Chelsea techno-trendy.,"I couldn't put it better than the reader from Maryland but I guess I find the images a bit more captivating than he/she did. What's disturbing to me is that Crewdson's work seems to be another example of our collective march into what I can only call techno-gigantism. Star Wars comes to Art. Thanks to science, technology, big business, show business & MONEY, anything can be accomplished. It's the equivalent of a basketball team of 8-footers who never miss the basket. Was all this effort worth the puny results?"
3,"Eh, its okay, not great, but not completely awful",I think the cover photo (also plate #19) is the best. There are 40 total plates. Most of the other images are odd but not worth what I paid. There are maybe about a dozen images that are pretty cool and thought provoking. I liked the woman kitchen kneeling down in a kitchen filled flower garden bed...the kid with his arm down the shower reaching into the crawlspace -- viewed in crossection...the pheasant feast of wonderbread stacked towers in the rear of someone's yard ... If you find a cheap copy it's interesting enough.
3,gibson exhaust,system looks nice on the truck but is not loud at all had to take it to a muffler shop to install one pipe was to short one going from the cat to the muffler and right side tail pipe had to be bent was pointing out to the side not out back
1,A total waste of time.,"This book was given to me as a gift, and I was anxious to read about many things that I didn't know about. Maybe some tips on how to be a good husband; maybe some ideas about how to plan for a child; maybe some good stories about other soon-to-be-dads helping out their pregnant wives. I got none of this. I read the story about a man who seems to be put out at the fact that he has 4 children. I feel as though the author thinks he is making headlines when he tells you that binge drinking until 2am isn't going to happen for you any more. I felt as though the whole book was telling me, ""My God, what have you done...Your life is over."" Well, I can say that a month after bringing my wonderful son home, the journey has just started and its been the best month of my life. If you've already read this book, don't let this jerk fool you. If you haven't read this book, DON'T. There is nothing that is of use, and it will only try to discourage you."
1,I bought it USED and it should have been for FREE!,"I bought this book used and it is horrible!! I agree with people who say he is arrogant, sarcastic and just out and out mean!! If he had been my husband oi.. I would have sent him packing at the first month of the first child. What an insensitive jerk! He talks about having kids as if its as bad as having your wisdom teeth removed.. Its not. Its a wonderful experience that can make a couple even closer. I am the mother of a four year old.. I was a single mom at first then met my husband.. we are planning to start trying in January.. This man and I use that term lightly who wrote this book.. was not meant to be a father or husband.. Please.. if you are a first time father.. DONT GET THIS BOOK!!"
4,A Candid Look Into Parenting,"This book should be made a requirement for the expecting Dad. It justifies the phrase ""expecting Dad"" for all of us who have problems dealing with the fundamental reality, that, yes indeed there is a baby on the way. With a wide use of humorous anectdotes liberally splashed into well thought out sections covering topics which are on board for your fatherhood, Peter Downey gives alot of food for thought and useful tips to help ease your transition into babydom. Much lighter than a self help book on the same topic for women, Peter seems to have a knack for using testosterone as an excuse for using borderline offensive comedy that puts it straight to the point on alot of difficult issues that arise before, during and after unprotected sex.A well thought out book, I would recommend this to anyone looking for food for comfort on anything but abortion. Maybe I'm not Peter Downey."
2,Useless Book,"I do believe that there are some excellent books for guys that are experiencing this life changing experience. However this is not one of them. I gave this to my partner when we found out our surrogate is pregnant, we are now 26 weeks along- today to be exact.... and I think he has tried to read it several times, but has found not any aspect interesting. So, I too am going to be a dad, for me this is my third child, but my partners first. But I perused the pages... Its silly to be honest with you!"
2,Let me save you $12.95,"This is NOT a ""guide,"" as the back cover suggests. It's an English teacher's attempt at comedy writing...cornball comedy. As in, If you love the TV show ""Yes, Dear,"" this might be for you. The basic message is that dealing with a pregnant wife sucks, raising a baby sucks, but fatherhood has some nice benefits. Thanks, Dr. Spock. Consider this passage from the end of the book: ""And now that you've almost finished this tome, I'll let you in on a little secret...Nothing can really prepare you for being a father. I hope you're not disappointed, but I had to put this earth-shattering statement at the end of the last chapter, otherwise you might not have read the book."" I wish I'd read this page first, so I could have missed out on some of the half-truths and misinformation the author buries between half-assed jokes."
1,Good for some.....but not me.,"If you're one of those Dads-to-be sitting on the edge of your seat, chewing your fingers to the bone thinking ""oh no, my life is over now"", then this book is for you, because it will definitely help to reinforce those thoughts. Personally, I'm over the moon that I'm going to be a Dad and can't wait for the big day. Hence why after reading a few chapters of this book I couldn't understand why I suddenly felt disturbed about the prospect. I found that throwing the book across the room fixed that though (much to my wife's amusement) and the book is now sitting on the shelf at my local 2nd hand book store...."
1,Very Disappointing - Do Not Buy This Book,"I read the first couple chapters of this book because my wife gave it to me. (I guess the cutesy title and nice cover caught her eye.) I felt bad, but I had to tell her the reason I stopped reading was because the book is useless. The author seems like he spent very little time writing this. The stories are unrealistic and he still can't make them entertaining. You wonder what publisher actually allowed this to go to print. Hopefully, you're reading this before you spend the money and aren't just another sucker like my wife was. No offense sweetie :)"
3,"The lighter side to all the ""heavy"" advice","As soon as you announce to your family and friends that you are ""in a family way"", everybody seems to have volumes of advice to give you, very often serious, sometimes even alarming. And of course, most of it is reserved for the mom-to-be. A buddy gave me this book as a subtle joke, to alleviate my feeling of being on the sidelines and not knowing what to expect.Though this book is somewhat short on substance, it goes a long way in giving you a first glimpse at what parenting means from the father's perspective. As you read it, you feel as though you're gathered around the grill sipping a cold beer and listening to a humorous guy recounting his experience at being a new father. A lot of it is fluff, but a few things rang true for me as my first child arrived. ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" this book is not.So of course, when my younger brother gave us the news, I couldn't resist puting this book in his hands."
1,Awful Book!,"""So You're Going to Be a Dad"" is neither humorous or informative as the other reviewer has stated. It is an unconnected series of humorless one-liners by someone surely headed for divorce court. I cannot overstate how bad this book is. It takes every positive experience and warps into a terrible tasteless joke. The writer states in the book that he is an high school English teacher. God help our children.Read ""The Expectant Father"" by Brott & Ash. It does not try to insult you at every turn."
4,Insightful and Easy Reading,"This is our first child and I was nervous. My wife had been reading several books, but they all seem to be targeted at women. Then I found ""So You're Going to Be A Dad"". This book is written for men by men. There are stories and tips in there that will save you a lot of grief during and after the pregnancy. I definitely recommend it. It's funny and moves at a good speed."
4,Highly Recommended,"This book came highly recommended by a friend, and it's short, sweet and to the point, with a little humor to help the reading.Highly recommended for first time dad's and even for expectant moms."
4,Getting Ready to be a Dad....?,"This book was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is 2 months ahead of me on her pregnancy. She bought it for her husband to help him understand what us women are going through during this pregnancy (to help them comprehend the meaning behind those hormones and all). Also to get an idea of what being a Dad is going to be all about. Preparation and all. I think my husband enjoyed this book, he started reading it the day I got it for him and has changed his outlook on things in regards to what he needs to do to help me along with this pregnancy. For example, cleaning the litter boxes was something he was opposed to doing, but after getting into the book, his outlook changed and he realized that he needs to do his part as well to keep our baby safe. It's a little outdated in some aspects, it was written in the 90's but some things never change and those are the important parts."
4,Little Outdated,The service was great and the book in very good condition. The material is a little outdated though.
4,Solid but Needs More!,"This is a solid book for what it is and what it covers. However, as was mentioned in another review there needs to be more. The chapters could include more details, exercises & drills, etc. As we know, just reading about a subject doesn't improve knowledge and skills, only the application of the material can lead to improvements. I think the authors could have provided more ways for direct applications. However, it's a book that I would recommend to anyone interested in personal safety with or without the use of firearms."
3,Awsome,"Furthermore's Flouresent Jellyfish C.D. is awesome. It's a funny, hip-hop/rock c.d. that displays Christian themes. If you aren't a hip-hop lover, and despise it, you might hate this c.d. It's a great c.d, and it's worth a lot more than you'll pay for it!"
3,The Shadow of Saganami,"I have been a David Weber fan for over ten years. The Honor Harrington books have been excellent as have the Heir to Empire series. However, his last few books have become very wordy and overly long. The Shadow of Saganami would have been much more enjoyable if it had been about half as long. The excessive length no longer allows for ""a fast paced"" adventure."
2,Too Wordy,"Usually I enjoy Webers work but this one was so wordy with so little action for a 2 1/2inch paperback that I literally skimmed through looking for action paragraphs. I don't like it when authors grind out ""the next book....""."
2,Bored,"Hey what happened to the adventure part of David Weber's books? The first part of the Honor Harrington series was great! So was ""Path of the Fury"" and ""In Death Ground."" The words action-packed and fast paced come to mind when thinking of ""March Upcountry"" and the rest of the series with John Ringo. ""The Shadow of Saganami"" is just a shadow of the adventure that David Weber used to be. This is just a long-winded expose' on politics. If I wanted politics, I would go to the current events section of the book store, not science fiction. If you are looking for excitement and battle scenes, look up John Ringo's ""Ghost."" If you are having problems falling asleep at night, buy ""Shadow of Saganami."" Really, though, unless you are REALLY into politically based Sci-Fi, this is not the book for you."
4,Saganami Tradition Rules,"An excellent parallel work to the Honor series. Well done space action, good knowledge of naval tradition and practice (Reviewer is a retired USN Captain). Really liked the emphasis on honor and tradition and duty!"
3,Crikey!!!,"Whoo this is a long read. My first foray with David Weber's Honor work. It has moments of interest and I actually found some of the political elements intriguing. However, the book began to play out like a weak space opera. The plucky midshipmen became a pale backdrop to the ongoing issues of Captain Terekov. There is a lot of dialogue. There is a LOT of intrigue, perhaps too much. I found the book adequate, but tiring. A book of this type should have wrapped up within 300 pages.There is some interesting military aspects to the work, but for the uninitiated they will likely stay away from Weber. As will I."
4,Paid by the word?,"Don't get me wrong; I'll undoubtedly read everything Weber writes, so he can't be doing anything a reader can't forgive.That said, his style can get wearying. I remember a 4-page discussion that boils down to three sentences:""Hmm... do you think she's dead?""""We can't be sure. Even if we had a forensics team in place, there are no DNA samples available for her.""This passage is the norm, not an exception, and that very same discussion is repeated at least four times, with no meaningful changes.A Weber character would never say, ""I'm going home now."" No, a Weber character would say, ""Under the circumstances, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure I won't be going home rather sooner than later.""And he'd say it again in different words, just to be sure.Only in a battle does Weber cast off the chains of verbosity and get things in gear. But that's often enough, apparently."
2,a boring cartoon,In a universe where everyone has blue eyes and walks ten feet tall acomplicated plot with hundreds of players could be both confusing and boring. Weber is good at one thing: Operatic space battles. Unfortunately there is very little of that in Shadow of Saganami. Most of the book is taken up by political discussions between various groups on several planets. It bored me to tears!
2,Disappointed,"I have always enjoyed Dave's Harrington universe...until I got to this book. Please...will someone tell me who the protagonist of this book is? Whose story is it? Who am I supposed to get emotionally involved with or root for? The entire crew? The Manty's political process? And if there is no protagonist, who is the antagonist ""against?""I'm sorry, good writing is not enough...lets have a traditional antagonist/protagonist pair to hang this story onto please."
3,A new twist the Manties sans their star,"The story is a series of twists and turns with a few surprises. The lack of Weber's star is missed but he is creating new characters that may continue into the future. Not my favorite of the series,"
2,Cure for insomnia,"This one will lull you to sleep if you read it before bedtime, trust me. The set up in the first two thirds of the book is tedious and I found myself flipping through page after page before the pace quickened to the point where it began to hold my interest. However, even the passages describing the action sequences are densely written. It is hard to believe that this is the same author that wrote ""The Apocalypse Troll"" or ""Path of the Fury"". This is the last time I'm going to be sucked into buying a David Weber novel from the blurbs on the book."
2,disappointment,"I generally love david weber's work. I own almost all of his books in hardback. I am hoping that this book is just giving us more information that will be utilized in future offerings. I read very fast, and am on page 231. So far this book is boring. I am not sure I can force myself to finish. Maybe the next 400 pages are fantastic and explain the difference between my review and others on amazon."
1,generic junk,"I could not get more than 50 pages into this poorly written novel.Bad dialogue, cardboard characters.There are too many good books out there to spend time with this junk."
5,R.I.P. John Larkin,"I just found out today that sadly Scatman passed away on Dec 3rd through terminal Cancer. I Truly enjoyed all his music i managed to get hold of and heard, and realise he had a meaning even though it was dance music. His music will live on in me for a long time ;o)"
5,Where it all began,Im a huge fan of the baby blues comic strip. When I started collecting the books of my favorite comic strips. I knew I had to get the book chronicling the first strips.This book is funny and almost anyone can relate to it...well mainly parents who either have a new baby or remember the days of having one.Watch as Wanda and Darryl learn the hardships of being a parent when their daughter Zoe is born. Goodbye sleep.Pros:-Collects the first strips of the series-Parents can easily relate
5,A must have book for all parents and kids!!,"I got this book about 3 months ago, and I loved it! It shows you that parenting isn't the most easiest thing in the world. This book has lots of laughs and good times in it. So if you want lots of laughs (100 percent guranteed) then get this wonderful book!"
4,Great Phone,"We love the phones and answering machine. We particularly like the ability to page the other phones and transfer calls between phones. This comes in handy when the person who answers the phone is on a different floor of the house. We are experiencing no difficulty with interference with our wireless computer system. Once in a while we do get some interference on the phone, but it does not last long."
2,"Good phone, but only recieved one base and 1 handset... ?","I am really happy with this purchase and am really happy with the phone, but I was supposed to have paid for 4 handsets and 2 bases and 2 chargers and I only recieved one base and one handset. I dont know why and I am taking it up with the company. It arrived today."
5,"Great anime, disapearing fast!","This was a great series, which was discontinued and is no longer produced. This was a steal, considering most are trying to sell it for $100 or more! :( get it while you can! BTW bought this for my younger cousin, who is an avid Dark fan, for x-mas ans she was esatic!"
5,Good value product.,"I bought Aprilaire Model 600 humidifier to replace an old one and installed it myself. The installation was easy with clear instructions and duct cutting templets. Works fine, the difference in air humidity is noticeable. Automatic mode with the outside temperature sensor is a good feature. Be aware that if your furnace does not have humidifier control 24V terminals with automatic turn-on, you will need a current sensor, which is not included. Check the manual to find the current sensor model number, so that you can by it at the same time."
1,.... received but not used....,"Good idea, but a waste of my money, as not universal in context - very much set in the African-American context - shame it neglects other possibilities."
3,Totally dissappointed !!,"This really sucks. This flashlight has not had the new brighter LED bulb upgrade. Its not even 1/4 as bright as the ones at Walmart with the new upgraded bulb. Well you CAN use this to club someone to death,. They got me on this one, BEWARE THIS FLASHLIGHT HAS THE OLD BULBS NOT THE NEW BRIGHTER LED ONES. GOT SEX DONE TO ME ON THIS DEAL."
4,Magic Maglite,"Good build quality,good heft when needed. Nice bright light when the LED module (purchased separately) is fitted. Why not buy an LED Maglite-if the LED fails at O DarknO'Clock what do you do? With this torch, you have a spare globe in the base to get you home safely."
5,Mag Upgraded the bulb to a G4 bi-pin,"Well, all I can really say is that this light no longer uses the typical PR base you're all used to. This one now uses the G4 bi-pin style (but with a new collar, you can get it to use the normal PR-style base)I never keep my incan mags stock (it's actually out being turned into a 1D as I type)"
3,Good and not so good,"Made out of good steel, good welds. Had to drill my holes for my seats(probably cause of older 3a seats I bought used), now having to modify my brackets to chassis(1991 s13). If you like to mod its great for the price. Anyways they maintain stock seat belt locations, and at least on my car(s13) I have to bend them some to get them to fit in the cockpit. As for an s14 dont know my friends isnt here for a quick test fit."
1,Disappointing,"Previously had this ball in a 5"" diameter and it lasted years with my Scottish Terrier. Purchased this ball and a few others that are smaller. Disappointed, the ball came with a split at the seam. I gave it to the Scotty and it didn't stay intack a day. The planets on the other balls were completely one with the ball, just a different color. This ball the planets on this ball are poorly attached. I worried he would swallow the pieces. This ball was worthless, and I didn't dare to let him play with it anymore. I also purchased the Tuff Diamond, Orange and the Silver balls. They are good quality, he loves them and they can stand up to a strong dog. I would highly recommend them. As for the Planet ball, I feel a refund is in order. Worthless, and dangerous."
4,"Great ball,but 1 solid piece would make it excellent!","Popeye, my 10 month old English bulldog, loves it and so do I. Yes, it's tough, but after 2 days, he's started to remove the green ""land pieces"". This ball would be perfect if it was all one solid piece. I'll definitely be purchasing more of orbee's ""5 chomper rated"" chew toys. He still hasn't damaged the ball itself, so it's a keeper."
2,Maltese destroyed in 20 minutes.,"I thought I had found the solution to my dog's destructive chewing in this ball. I received it today, and within 20 minutes, my dog had started pulling the blue chunks off the ball. I can see where this is going, and don't want him to swallow pieces. I will be contacting the company and hoping they will exchange/refund."
4,Great toy!,"My 50lb lab/husky mix and 60lb boxer/lab mix love the medium ball. the only problem is that they pulled all the land part of the planet off immediately, and that is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. the rest of the ball is very tough, even with the lab/husky mix that loves to chew up toys."
4,My Dog's Favorite Ball,"It's a great ball, my GSD loves it. The drawback is that all orange parts, ""the continents"", get unglued pretty quickly, so if your dog tends to swallow everything coming his way, it could be a real danger. The ball itself though is pretty sturdy and lasts for a long time."
3,"Ball failed to hold up to ""Destructo""","I have a 18 month old Weimaraner who has a Masters Degree in general destruction with a Minor in Toy Dismantlement. Few and far between is a toy that lasts more than a week (tennis balls, basketballs, rope toys, sticks, tree limbs, logs and various and sundry household items).Cynder (Destructo) was not at all intimidated with the new challenge. Upon being presented with a new toy she immediately examines it for weaknesses. It took her all of 5 minutes to begin her assault on the continents, and 5 minutes later they began to peel.On the up side, she stopped chewing about 20 minutes later and the ball is relatively unscathed. I am a little disappointed that there was so much peeling, but tiring out her jaws is worth it.I would have rated it higher, but with the peeling you have to be on guard that there is no eating, so I have not yet found that ever-elusive ""perfect"" toy."
2,"The brand is ok, but the ""land"" pieces on this ball are easily able to be ripped off.","In general we like the ""tuff"" ball brand a lot because they are harder to destroy them most other balls, BUT.....the green land pieces on this ball are just glued on. As such, my dog was EASILY able to rip off (and tried to eat) all of the green land pieces. After they were all ripped off, he played with the ball - but I was disappointed in the ball and the ability for it to be torn apart especialyl when this brand is know for its durablilty! Ive bought other ""tuff"" balls, but I try and not buy any like this with little pices that can be ripped off - since they are just glued on. Also, this ball - like all of the tuff balls - have 2 holes in it - which allows your dog to get his/her teeth in there which they use to try and rip it. Still though, I would buy ""tuff"" balls, but NOT this one ever again because o fhte little pieces that can be destroyed."
5,Love it,"Since I don't try the dog toys I have to take my dog's assessment and give 100 different rubber balls he goes for this one every time. Plus the withe and orange one glows in the dark, drastically improving night time fetch sessions."
1,Disappointing and dangerous,"I have been searching for a ball our beagle-dachshund mix would be able to play with safely. This seemed like the product. The orbee looks as if it is molded out of a single piece of material. BUT, the raised areas are actually glued on. After about 20 minutes, our little ""beenie"" chewed off and swallowed a big chunk of the raised spot (green area on the blue ball). What followed her joyful 20 minutes was a night filled with her vomiting up the pieces. Luckily, she did not end up with an obstruction. I would think that a product made to be ""tuff"" for dogs who chew wouldn't use glued on materials."
2,Other Planet Dog Toys are Better,"If your dog is a chewer, or has a strong mouth and like to clamp down on things, go with a different planet dog toy. One that does NOT have the little rubber pieces glued on (they have many other options). Those little world pieces fall off quickly after being bit on, and you need to make sure you get them from your pup fast before they're eaten."
4,"Good, but puppy causes global devestation.","As a ball toy, this is my 9 month old standard Poodle's favorite and most durable. That said, in a matter of an hour or two, the contrasting ""continent"" features were chewed off. I contacted Planet Dog directly and was offered full credit toward a replacement and advise to choose one of there one piece designs. I'm going to wait and see how the rest holds up."
4,Durable but no rope,"I've bought these before and they've lasted longer than any other ball for my shepherd. Every other Orbee I've purchased has come with a rope which goes thru the two pre-cut holes in the ball. Their rope was also incredibly durable. This one did not. To be fair, the picture on this one doesn't show a rope. That said, all of these are made for one. People should know that ALL hollow balls are made to be interactive and not to be left as ""chew toys."" When you're done playing with your dog, put the ball away and leave them with a true chew toy. If it had come with the rope, I'd have given it the 5 stars that it would then have deserved."
2,I normally like Planet dog products...,"My dog, who is not a really aggressive chewer, managed to pull parts of the continents off of the globe. I don't like that these are a possible choking/obstruction hazard for him. He likes the toy and the ball itself is pretty long-lasting. But I just don't like him being able to pull off pieces of it."
3,Hard to find ball,I have been looking in all the stores for this ball. Highly recommended as all Planet dog Orbee toys are. I found it here at Amazon and was delighted. The only problem with the ball is my 8 month old puppy BT can't pick it up. I think maybe his missing teeth could be the problem. He can catch and retrieve all his other balls. I am hoping this will improve when his teeth come in. He tries and gives up after a few seconds.
3,Orbee blue green earth ball,Loved the ball and the texture of it but the dogs have chewed most of the green off. The ball has held up well to the heavy chewers that I have.
3,My dog is loving it but....,"My dog is playing right now with it, the bouncing is great but the land (orange area) is going bye-bye... it wont last the day.It also comes perforated with a string around the ball, i didn't know this (it is not mentioned). I get rid of the string so my dog can play better.My dog is a miniature schnauzer, and this size of the ball (small) is not adequate, if she still loving it without the orange area, i will buy the medium size."
2,Not a good toy if your dog loves to chew,My Jack Russell loved playing with the ball. The downside to it was that because my dog LOVES to chew she was capable of destroying the ball. The ball soon had cracked and there were parts of it missing. Overall a pretty decent toy but easily destructable.
1,"Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Orbee Ball, Large, Blue/Green","Ball does not hold up to a Mastiff's play, not even for 15 minutes. This is unacceptable to me! Don't waste your time or money. The continents fall off way too quickly."
1,dangerous dog toy!,"I purchased two Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Orbee balls, for my German shepherds. This product has changes. The planets are ""attached"" to the ball by some sort of glue I guess. During play these large planet shaped pieces of plastic come off and can become a choking hazard. I began finding them in my dogs stools and all over the house. The balls without the planets are very dangerous as they are very slimy and slippery. I have always loved planet dog products and loved the old ones as the planets were molded into the ball. I am going to try to get a refund for these useless and dangerous balls!After I wrote the review I contacted Planet Dog as the balls were too old for a full Amazon refund. They were very nice and in fact are replacing these for me with their Luna Balls which I love! I was very impressed with the attitude of the company!"
2,Received the wrong item,"I ordered the tuff orbee ball which I have for my other dog, and she absolutely loves it! Lasts forever! Unfortunately, I received the SOL ball instead. Not as good as the orbee (the one with the map on it), not as durable and much softer. Since I wasn't home when I received the package, the ball was given to my dog and he didn't have it for 1 hour before he slit it. Won't be able to return, obviously. Guess I'll have to leave strict instructions for when i'm not home.If you want a ball that lasts with aggressive chewing, I highly recommend the tuff orbee ball, not the SOL."
2,Not so tuff Orbee-Tuff Orbee Ball!,"I have a two year old female yellow lab. I've had this ball for a little over a week; she has already managed to chew off some of the raised Earth around the ball. I would not recommend this toy for dogs that are powerful chewers. It's a fun toy and my lab has really enjoyed it; however, chewing off the Earth has become more of a game than fetching the ball. If you're like me and concerned with the ingestion of such pieces, I would look for another toy."
3,Not as indestructable as it seems...,"Just received this ball in the mail about 30 minutes ago, and within 5 minutes of giving it to my 2 yr/old lab/pointer mix, she had nearly all of the planet pieces pulled off and a silver dollar sized chunk of the ball missing. It feels relatively durable to the touch, but for the heavy chewers I would recommend something else. I personally believe that the mint flavoring and soft texture encourage dogs to bite and chew at this toy?"
2,Pets loved it and destroyed it in less than 1 hour,"I have two dogs between 45 and 55 pounds. They absolutely looovved the toy the second they got it. However, in less that one hour we were missing half of the ""continents"" on the ball. It is concerning since my dog proceeded to try and eat the plastic continents. Would not recommend for a persistent chewer."
2,not up to par,loved how the ball looked and felt but the outer part is very easy for any dog to pull off!!! did not last a week!
3,Good ... but destructible,"I thought I had finally found the ""indestructible"" dog toy. Well the continents only lasted a couple of minutes before they were tore off. The ball did last 2 weeks for my Catahoula - which is about the norm for ""tough"" dog toys. Here is what I have tried: tennis balls (last less than 10 minutes), lacrosse balls (ok, but tears tiny pieces off and swallows them), big red kong ball (same problem as lacrosse balls), and now the Orbee.I think it is a good ball overall ... but did not last for my dog."
2,Great for a non chewer,"I purchased this for a boykin spaniel puppy. He loved it, however, the continents can easily be chewed off. My puppy only had this for 3 weeks with only a few supervised play sessions before he started to work off the continents edges."
1,Orbee-Not-Tuff,Seriously? My 9 month old puppy ripped off pieces in minutes....Threw them up later. Planet Dog rates this on their site as one of their toughest toys.....waste of money!
5,love it,it is just what was advertised and am very much pleased with the product. i highly resommend it5 stars
1,Bruce Hornsby in name only,Love Bruce Hornsby but I should have read up on this before buying. It is a straight Jazz instrumental and not to my liking
4,excellent photos,"this book has some great photos of the black panthers and their community. also some good information , though nothing of the great insight into the panthers that can be found by reading the writings of those that were involved, such as huey p newton , bobby seale and many of the other folk that were involved ( there are many of these books out there ) however the photographs contained in this book are very well presented , and as is said , a picture tells a thousand words. this would be a welcome addition to anyone interested in the black panthers. highly recomended"
5,Great home enhancer,"The MailMaster Mailbox is easy to install, put over existing 4x4 post. My home is a Bedford Stone Ranch and it matches very close,the road is over 120 ft away it and looks super setting out there. It's pretty big. Sturdy and tight, the magnets work well on the doors. Very happy with the purchase, the price,the quality, and the delivery was fast. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to update your property or upgrade a tacky old mailbox. My mailman commented he really likes it. Said it was snazzy. 11-27-12 As a follow up to my 6-11 review after a year and a half and a winter on US 40 with snow plows determined to destroy it as they had the previous mail boxes, it withstood the assaults and still looks like new. Sun salt and acid rain and no fading. Very Happy"
3,Stone Hill Plus Mailbox,"Do we all realize that we are talking about a standing Outdoor Mailbox? It was not that comfortable to install!One of the magnets would not hold until we tilted the mailbox back a certain level. It has a nice presentation.Yet for $75.00, I expected each piece to be in order. Too much trouble to return, so we make do."
5,Very great set to have,This book along with the other books in this cooking set is wonderful. There is a whole section just about facts and the rest great recipes.
2,not what i wanted technically what i paid for.,"This practice weapon can be used for drills. Not for sparing. I received mine with the wrap coming loose but that was nothing a little concrete glue and 12 hours couldn't fix. It is everything I wanted (And thought I had paid for) from the handle to about 2 inches up the blade. That is where this Bokken goes wrong. It is cut about as thin as a real sword. which makes the practice weapon weigh a lot less, very breakable (thus unreasonable to spar with), and bent about the last 3-4 inches of the ""blade"". I don't recommend this for anyone wanting to spar and I do suspect that others are not as bent. This bokken is extremely breakable, problem is they do not say that it is a light bokken as opposed to the regular. 2 broken wooded swords out of 5.P.S. You get what you pay for when shopping at amazon for such things. Stick with sites that know what they are doing."
4,Gift for a Young Pianist,"I checked several music websites and also read the reviews on Amazon before selecting this particular collection of Scarlatti's sonatas. Born in the same year as both Bach and Handel, Scarlatti was well-known during his time and is worth taking the time to get to know today. I chose this CD as a gift for my daughter. She began to appreciate Scarlatti's style after her piano teacher assigned her one of his sonatas."
3,Basic Review,"I picked this up at a book sale and to honest was not expected that much, I basically wanted to brush up on my facts. This book offered me a good general detail of the American Revolutionary War. The book is average; I actually think it would be better suited as a young adult (teenager) review book. The writing was average, the presentation nothing to get excited about and the detail accurate but lacking anything unique enough to get your attention. I understand that this author is a well know historian that provides good overview books. This is defiantly an overview. By the way I was happy because I got exactly what I wanted out of the book, a refresher course."
2,Disappointed,"That other guy was right about one thing. This CD only contains 7 out of 18 of the tracks listed! It excludes the main songs I bought it for like: Cats don't know, Bling bling, Back that azz up, Wanna be a baller, Da goodness, and Vivrant thing. I gave it two stars because it does still have some ok songs on it, but check out the REAL tracks before you buy."
3,a little disappointing,"I was a little disappointed by the tracks on this cd. When I ordered it I thought that it would have different tracks because that's the way it was listed. Amazon needs to get this stuff right...they did the same thing with Now vol. 3. I ordered this cd because it was supposed to have Hot Spot, Can I Get A..., Vivrant Thing, Back That Azz Up, Wanna Be A Baller, Bling Bling, and No Pigeons. It's still a great cd with artists ranging from Eve to DMX to JT Money, but I couldn't help but be disappointed by the way I thought that it would be."
4,Viral Marketing?,I caught wind of the Flash cartoon that's being used to sell the song and I just have to say what a great job these guys are doing using internet marketing.Go watch 'Like a Cow' (mature audience please) and see if you don't find it more than a tad...
5,"I know every word, every note...the beginning, the end.","This album has been with me since it came out. I now carry it with me in CD form. You cannot truly appreciate music (from the last breath of the 60's) without having this in your collection. From my 20's to my 50's, it remains one of my favorites. I intend to be listening to this when I turn 80! (Best to buy two in case you wear one out.)"
5,Crosby Stills & Nash,Great remix of old songs on this CD. Brings back many good memories from my younger years! Enjoy listening at the Y while I work out.
5,I love this album soooooooo much!,"Everyday I go on an hour long walk just so I can gaze at the beautiful Texas sky and listen to this cd. This music puts me in so many moods...sad,insightful,energetic,and it makes me feel beautiful. The harmonies are so flowing that they give me goosebumps. You know its a good song when chills go through your spine. So take a walk and listen to this cd...it's their best work!Peace and love forever!"
5,transportation,"There is no point in me reviewing this magical album, song by song, because listeners here have done such a wonderful job... but I would like to say that for many of us, this was the background music to our lives. When I hear this album, I am transported and become, once again, that young girl sitting on the floor with her record player, listening to beautiful harmonies, watching the rain gently fall out my window while visions of what may become of me, someday, filled my dreams. Priceless."
5,c s n revisited,Saw these guys live right after the De Jevu album came out. Between sets Steven Stills was doing an excellent version of Jimi Hendrix. Dallas Taylor is the best drummer I ever saw live. Really brings back good memories
3,Over Rated,"Suite Judy Blue Eyes is an incredible openiner but it is downhill from there. Its not bad, its just not that great either and does not hold up well. Obviously, they needed Neil Young to help them put it all together as you can see on Deja Vu which is one of the greatest albums in history. Skip this and get Deja Vu!"
3,Average,"While I like the Stills tracks, and Nash's song ""Pre road downs"" most of this album sounds like a Simon and Garfunkal retread. Dunno, I personally think they would have sunk if not for the arrival of Neil Young. I reccomend The CSN&Y album ""Deja Vu"" instead of this one, because Crosby and Nash show their actal talents on that. Overall, it's not onerous to listen to, but there are lots of better albums out there."
5,dear Judy,"To hear ""Suite Judy Blue Eyes' is worth the cost of this beautiful album.....A tribute to a great lady, Judy Collins, and a great singer who has also endured. The rest of the cuts are equally challenging in both guitar work and vocal harmonies along with provacative rhythms. ..."
3,Mimi munchy sticks,They are not very big around and my little guys lose them in the yard when they are playing. Little dogs would love these
2,Not Your usual Rawhide,"I thought this was those regular chew rawhide I usually buy at the local store, but instead they are more like hard cookies. My dogs (small size) eat through this like cookies. The sticks snap so easily.I gave them 2 stars because my dogs doesn't mind eating them."
3,Okay,"When purchasing these I thought they would be the perfect solution to my rawhide loving chihuahua. However, it was not the case. While she did like eating them, they didn't give her a challenge and she gobbled them up."
2,"Not rawhide, not munchy","Perhaps some consider dipping packed rice stick treats in emulsified rawhide enough to label them as ""rawhide"", but certainly I do not. I like to give a rawhide stick to my Boston terrier most mornings while I'm getting ready to leave for work so she doesn't get anxious, but she bites these sticks in half immediately and they're gone within seconds! In my mind, rawhide chews are meant to be gnawed on for at least 10 mins.They also gave her some stomach upset and diarrhea, which no other rawhide product ever has. The ""made in China"" label should have made me suspicious immediately. I'm tossing what's left of the bag and never buying these again. My hope in leaving this review is that no one else will be fooled by the ""rawhide"" label."
1,Terrible All Around!!!,"i was expecting something like a bunch of bully sticks but these are gone in literally 4 bites! even with my 14 week old aussie! it seems like a bargain but it's seriously not much at all when the dogs devour a stick in like a min. they smell like they where dipped in motor oil or something awful. it get a bit better when you rinse them but still stinky and i feel reluctant to feed them to my dogs. my cattle dog mix turns his head when i try t give him these! awful treats, don't recommend to anyone!!! (i bought the beef basted)"
3,My puppy loves these,"This is a great product-my dog loves these. I was a little disappointed that it is a ""product of China"" which I why I only gave it 3 stars."
4,Definitely does the job,"I have collected all of Dr. Thompson's CDs and have enjoyed the benefits from each program. I like this product a lot, although the music is notas compelling for me as most of his other releases. but that is all a matter of personal preference and takes nothing away from the body of workthat is so wonderfully well done. I recommend this CD and the benefits therefrom."
4,Promoting Relaxation,"I have purchased several cds by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson for myself and to use with clients. This one is relaxing and the clients go into deep relaxation, some of them snore."
2,Just a bit too cute,"I like cigars, and I like mysteries. But this novel is far too cozy for my tastes.Still, there are some interesting moments. The students' tradition of stealing the cigar store indian was a nice touch and made the protagonist's relationship to the community all nice and warm and fuzzy. Really. A good touch.But the plot is predictable and so much attention is paid to what kind of cigar goes with what meal or drink, that it;s hard to take MURDER seriously.Give me some tough hardboiled guys with broken bottles and brass knuckles over this kind of timid crime novel any day."
4,A lot of Quicksand,If you like Quicksand this cd is a must. Swedens emu hardcore stars first album and maybe thier best. Harder then their later works but the feelings are there.
1,"Bad , surprisingly bad","For example, the laughably skewed accounts of the people and protocol of universities and the military. But let me emphasize the jarring prose. I could describe it, but examples speak pages. So take a look at these:""Hackett raised an eyebrow in an unconscious gesture"".""He took a bite, chewed, swallowed"".""He was a tall man, with no bulky muscles. His strength, which surprised many, was more accurately the result of being wiry. He was a nice-looking fellow with even features, but had small eyes that were more actually gray, though he insisted they were blue."""
3,"Bland setting, lacking flavor...","While the plot is a solid one, dealing with subjects and issues that I found interesting, the delivery is bad. The characters are stereotypes, the setting - in the middle of the 21 century, seems no different from now. The author just adds a few things, like colonies on Mars and a few space stations.As you read the book you might notice things are missing. Like names. What is the name of the university where some of the main characters work? What state is State Senator from? What is the name of the space station turned starship? What party does the President belong to? These tiny details are the spice of any story that helps develop it, give it background. Without them a story can be good, but not great. And this story needed them, because it was not good. Like a steak on the grill, sometimes you need something to go with it.If you want something easy, get this book. If you want a great, detailed, book with a great ending, look someplace else."
2,"Highly Lacking, But Not All Bad","As other reviewers have pointed out there are lots of things missing here. Science and engineering are missing, in so many ways. Plot continuity is battered at best as is character development. Yet somehow its imperfections are surely akin to the imperfections of any reaction we'd have in a situation like that. The improbable reactions in the plot become believable as we watch the real news and see real politicians willing to cripple America to make a political point. So I'd encourage anyone to not start this book, but if you do you may get some pleasure as you waste your time reading it."
2,Fairly awful,"After seeing in the author bio that he was some sort of UFOoligist, I was dubious about this book but tried it anyway. Maybe that preconception colored my experience but I really didn't get much out of this book. Some his science and technology is weak or wrong, I felt that the characters were 2-dimensional, and the plot plodded and was quite predictable in places. Overall, I won't bother with Randle again."
4,Someone is Out There,"This is the first book of The Exploration Chronicles. It deals with a simple premise; a signal of most-likely intelligent origin has been detected from space. How will the world react?In Signals, Kevin D. Randle takes a look at the scientific, military, academic, political, and journalistic communities and how they react to the discovery of a signal that is probably intelligent in origin. Members of each of these communities is highlighted as they try to better their careers with the news or get roped in by it. Randle does an excellent job of predicting how some people would react. From the first hours that the signal is detected all the way to a massive grandstand the story moves through believable paces.At first this seems like a hard-science SF novel, but it really deals very little with the science and pays most of its attention to human nature and reaction. I hope that the other books in this series are as good because it certainly started out on the right foot."
4,Beguiling bubblegum with lots of surprises,"Not the possessor of a strong voice, nor a charismatic, individualistic way with a song, Shelley Fabares was a radio-friendly song-interpreter, a singing actress who did more than a decent job with the material handed to her. The tracks are well-produced and occasionally memorable. Especially good are ""Ronnie, Call Me"" and ""He Don't Love Me"". Of course, ""Johnny Angel"" is the one real classic, and it still sounds good on oldies-radio, but Shelley had other treats in store and this compilation pulls some great ear-candy out of oblivion. (NOTE: my copy contains 18 tracks in all--3 not listed here on Amazon: ""I Know You'll Be There"", ""Lost Summer Love"" and ""Pretty Please"", plus a ""bonus track"", Shelley in the studio)"
2,Why only 15 songs?,"All reviews + the Amazon song list state 18 songs on Shelley's""the best of CD"". I wonder why I've got only 15. The CD isexactly the same (Sequal, 1994). In spite of that some of thesongs are nice because they formed part of our schooldays butthe rest is quite silly. There are 2 very nice ones, however,the beauty ""I'm Growing Up"" and ""He Don't Love Me"". When I heardthe latter for the first time I immediately thought of Jan & Deanand when I checked the writer it was Jan Berry indeed. Anywaymay be its better to have 15 instead of 18 songs all together."
4,"a killing joke album, plus...","There are so many members of Killing Joke in this band, it's almost absurd that it's recorded under a different name.With that said, it's a terrific 2-CD set. It's got Chris Connelly singing his poetically dizzying lyrics, 3 guys from KJ and two drummers...one of them being Martin Atkins. Recorded mostly in 1992-93, it culminates the sounds of all the guys who've come together. It is missing a few remixed gems, but it's a great compilation of their only album, plus some extra remixes and live recordings. It's a must have if you're in to Pigface or KJ...in 2000 these guys got together again under the name THE DAMAGE MANUAL and put out two awesome CD's...if you get this and like it, get those two discs, too."
3,A collection of Yes member's recent solo works.,"Yes: Friends and Relatives is a collection of recent solo projects from the most notable members of Yes. Most of the material is available on other solo albums. Unfortunately for Yes fans, the best songs on this compilation are the live tracks from ""Keys to Ascention"" I and II, which most of you diehards probably already have. Steve Howe's cover of ""Walf Don't Run"" is a kick. Only Jon Anderson's solo efforts sound as though they were recorded in the '90s. As such, his latest effort ""The More You Know"" may be worth checking out. To the avid Yes fan (such as myself) this effort neither disappoints nor excites. All in all, Friends and Relatives proves that Yes was, indeed, much greater than the sum of its parts."
1,Ouch!,"Picked it up on the cheap and got what it was worth.Bad outtakes and d grade material repackaged and ""mixed"".I especially thought the Euro dance remix of Owner was atrocious.Jon ,are you sniffing glue?The acoustic take of Roundabout was OK,but this album on the whole was just not necessary.Don't buy this one."
1,recycle value only,"I bought this book earlier this year because it was the only book available on Servlets ( or at least the title implied that it was about Servlets ). In my opinion, it's publication was little more than an opportunistic grab at the pockets of programmers wanting an early start on Servlets. It is a truely worthless book."
1,A book so bad it is laughable,"I got this book from a friend who was going to throw it away. After perusing it, I threw it away. You would learn more about servlets from reading a couple of articles in periodicals! This book's content is so vapid and the author's style is so pretentious it is comical. No doubt, I would have been less amused if I'd wasted my money on it instead of just my time.Instead of stars, I think Amazon.com should offer a bomb icon for a book this bad."
2,This book offers very little to servlet developers.,"If you were waiting for a book that offered an in depth treatment of servlets, you'll have to keep waiting. This book on Java Servlets and JDBC offers only 20 pages on Servlets and the content of those pages is pretty thin. Do you really want to see the code for a 'Hello World' or a counter servlet? The author's code is generously shared on a diskette glued to the back cover. For US$50 at least give me the code on CD-ROM! This book reminds me of those overpriced paperback textbooks, written by the instructor, we were compelled to buy in college. I wish JavaSoft would step up to the plate and publish a book that thoroughly covers servlets with useful, annotated examples and maybe even include an appendix of the complete Servlet API classes."
1,Gimme back my MONEY!,"How could Amazon include this thing on its selections! It's an offense to any programmer with the desire to learn.It's total anti-java.It's not simple,It's not portable and it gives the impression that it was written to an elite of javaheads that think they're so cool because of their explosives I.Qs. These people are not writing for people.They're writting for themselves Big time show-offs. Go work for microsoft!"
1,Amazon.com should discontinue selling this book.,"As with all the other online reviews that have been written about this book, the title is absouletly misleading. This book is about very basic Java concepts. And in protest, I recomend that all fellow programmers refrain from purchasing anything else written by these so-called authors."
1,Just don't bother with this book!,"With the lack of books about servlets I bought a copy of this, excited and hoping that I would actually learn something from it. I am fairly new to java programming and knew very little about servlets before reading the book - after having read through the book I am absolutely none the wiser. I really don't know who this book is aimed at, but I for one am annoyed that my hard earned money has been wasted on a book that is only really suited to keeping the back door open. Only buy this book if you like an arrogant style of writing with little useful information, or if like me you have wonky hinges."
1,This book has near zero value.,"This book more than deserves the poor reviews. How it got published is a mystery. It has no value as a reference and the few, poor examples it offers you've probably already seen somewhere else.I wish I'd kept my receipt."
2,not very helpful,"I wouldn't waste your time on this one, like the other reviewers stated, its not a good book on servlets. Doesn't go into much detail. This would be a good book for someone who is just starting java and has a very basic understanding of RDBMS, as it covers jdbc and sql 101.. but it is not a good resource for servlet developers."
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought this book several months ago thinking I would get some good information about two subjects that fit well together. But I discovered that it covered both subjects sparsely. It seemed to cover more about Jeeves and applets than servlets and jdbc. I hate the fact that I spent so much on a book that I used so little. If you want an excellent book on servlets, get O'Reilly's Java Servlet Programming instead."
4,For the Boston Fan,"This is one more to add to your collection of Brad Delp cd's. If you like any of Boston's music, then you must pick up the RTZ cd's. If you were very disappointed by the last Boston cd (I've reviewed seperate) entitled Corporate America, this cd should pick you back up. Certainly this is melodic music and certainly carries on with that unique Boston sound that boost Brad Delp into prominence. This may be lacking as far as creativity and is simply just for your listening pleasure. Make sure you pick up all their cd's (RTZ, Lost, Lost and Found). This cd comes with a bonus cd entitled Delp and Goudreau which is a must have also for Boston fans. More info about this band can also be found at nehrecords.com or barrygoudreau.com or bandboston.com."
4,very good for Boston Lite,"This is a good album from Brad and Barry. Very lite on the second side, partially heavy on the first side. Overall, a somewhat great effort from the two. I call this album ""Boston Lite"", cause it never rocks as hard as any of their other albums"
3,Good Advertising Primer,"This book by Alvin Boyd contains some great truths that transend the 1986 date the book was last published (4th printing). He share tips and insights several adervtising topics including:1. Setting up your own advertising department (Ch. 4)2. Advertising on a Budget (Ch. 5)3. Copy (ch. 13)4. Production (ch. 12) - note the corp. logos on p 176 and how little they have changed.5. Getting the most from freelance services (ch. 15)Overall, this book will give you the details that don't change in advertising and will help you understand how to make advertising work whether in a big business or small business.A 43 page glossery and 23 page index tells you how detailed this book (208 pgs excluding gloss. and index) is and how helpful it is, even if for a brief overview of certain topics. Very good addition to your business library."
4,Perfect replacement throne,"I bought this as a replacement / upgrade to my son's drum set. I got him the set when he was 13 years old. He is now 15 and as tall as me! He plays his drums every day and his old throne was wearing out. The other big problem was that it was too short for him.This throne from Pearl is nice. Heavy weight and it stands a lot taller than his old seat. It stays right where you set it (height wise) and is comfortable to sit on for long sessions.Could it be better? Yes, a little more padding would be nice and he may want a saddle shaped seat next time but that is a personal preference.I would buy it again. Great seat for the money."
3,What can I say?,"It's a specialized power supply designed to fit Shuttle cases. It seems to be a little nicer than the power supplies that come included with the older Shuttle cases, but not as good a quality as the newer generation of power supplies (in all sizes) that have been coming out in the last year."
1,"ICK, YUCK, AWFUL . . .","I love peppermints, but these were awful. Very disapointed.Not worth sending them back. So, I pitched the whole box of them.Awful, they tasted just awful."
4,"Great to have you back, Ty!",I loved both of Ty's first two albums and I couldn't believe it that this guy was without a recording contract for so long. The new album is possibly his best yet with some superb country music and an excellent bit of production from Mr Brooks. I just hope that this gets the sales that it deserves and is the first of many from this great singer/producer combination.
5,JUST GREAT!,"TYLER HAS A GREAT VOICE AND HE DOES A GREAT JOB ON THIS CD. THE SONG, I DROVE HER TO DALLAS, IS JUST A TYPICAL COUNTRY SONG ABOUT SOMEONE DRIVING SOMEONE AWAY. HE HAS A GREAT VARIETY OF SONGS FROM SLOW TO FAST. HIS VOICE HAS MATURED AND I BELIEVE TYLER WILL GO A LONG WAY. IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST TWO ALBUMS YOU WILL REALLY LIKE THIS ONE. BY PUTTING HIS BIG HIT SHOULD""VE ASKED HER FASTER ON THIS CD SHOWS PEOPLE THAT TYLER DIDN'T QUIT BECAUSE HE COULDN'T MAKE IT, HE DID IT FOR HIS FAMILY, WHO NEEDED HIM. I SUGGEST YOU BUY THE CD AND YOU WON'T BE SORRY. I SURE WASN'T."
4,Very Insightful Review of Lewis/Tolkien Fantasy,"If you have ever been perplexed as to why Tolkien and Lewis wrote the way they did, or perhaps were interested to find out how they came to write their masterpieces, this book is for you.From philosophical differences to various writing styles, this book covers all the bases regarding these two authors.As is the case with most philosophy books, it can take a lot of time to absorb all that is contained in the book, so give yourself lots of time. It's well worth reading every single word and not skipping anything. But this book answers several questions I had regarding Tolkien/Lewis, and it answers them very well. Pick up this book!!"
5,What a Thriller!,"This more of an opinion than a review.I loved this film the first time I saw it on TV. The startis so downbeat, I thought it would just fill a couple ofhours while I was babysitting. Then it took off and didn'tlet up until the very end.I was so impressed that I spent 3 years looking for thebook by James Grady ('Six Days of the Condor', which wasout of print at the time).I eventually got a copy of the book and went on to get anNTSC VHS tape (I live in PAL-land) and eventually a Region 1DVD (I'm in R2). I don't do that for many films.I cannot understand how this film got so little notice andisn't regularly shown on TV; I think it's fantastic."
3,Operaton Condor after 1973,"For any one who is interesting on the underworld of CIA since Richard Nixon administration, Operation condor was a real organization of assessins train by CiA, agent they operate in florida. Check on internet OPERATION CONDOR AND THE SCHOOL OF AMERICA OR ESCUELA DE LAS AMERICAS."
4,three days of the condor.,Only one problem with this film. The format of this film was not appropiate for the English market. I therefore had to watch this film on my monitor rather then my dvd player.
4,A good spy thriller.,"I must confess, I DO NOT like Robert Redford -- when his name is mentioned in my presence, I immediately get heartburn; however, his performance in this film is superior. If you liked ""All the President's Men"", then you'll like Redford in this one too. The story line is a great one, very believeable from my view, and is tastefully and coherently carried out -- much more contemporary than James Bond stuff and, serious, not silly in any way. So, in the end, this DVD is certainly worth buying if you enjoy that CIA film genre. If I did not personally despise Redford, I surely would give this one 5 stars."
5,Suspense and Intrigue at it's best.,"If you like your movies filled with a good story line, suspense, intrigue, and Robert Redford, you'll enjoy this movie. The CIA stuff and a guy stuck between a rock and a hard place make this movie one that you don't want to press the pause key on your remote to get a snack. A movie made in the mid 70's really is a quality film. Great shots of the World Trade Center with a scene actually taken from within one of the Trade Center Towers. Limited profanity and killing. Just enough to give the film the reality to deal with the subject matter. A guy flick for sure, but Redford will not be too hard on the eyes for the women. No disappointment purchasing ""Three Days of the Condor""."
5,Excellent movie of its time,"Early 70s, end of Bretton Woods gold standard, US needs, oil for its war in Vietnam and other places and the Saudis agree to only accept US dollars for oil. That's some of the reality behind this story. THe US has to control the Middle East and we have been there ever since, killing and being killed. This movie deserves a good look by anyone interested in what really makes the US tick."
2,Film has not aged well,"The first 10 minutes were fast-paced and exciting, but it was downhill after that. The story dragged on and with tighter editing, at least 30 minutes could have been cut and the film would have been much better.The one-night stand with Faye Dunaway was not believable and didn't advance the plot, and even the action scenes were flat. The script was pretty bad, too. At one point, when Dunaway is complaining to Redford about how badly he has treated her, he says ""At least I haven't raped you,"" and she replies ""The night is still young.""I saw this film 10 or 15 years ago and it seemed a lot better then than it did this time."
4,Very Good -- But Plot Spoiler Review,"PLOT SPOILER!This film is not a classic, but it is worth watching to see Robert Redford & Faye Dunnaway in their primes.The story line is good until the very ending -- then it yields to the paranoia of the times (1975): Big Government & the CIA controls everything, even the New York Times.A better ending would have been to re-write Redford's ""random"" choosing of Dunnaway's apartment to hideout. Make it less random, and more ""accidental"". Then in the end we discover that it is not her apartment, but a ""safe house"" and she has been sent to kill him (unbeknownst to the first assassin, Max Von Sydow).That final layer of excitement -- two assassins out to kill him -- which one saves him? Or not?"
3,Entertaining movie for today's current events,"I have seen this movie several times and recently watched it for free on Amazon Prime on the Kindle Fire. It has probably been over 10 years since I last watched this movie. It is amazing how poignant this movie is to today's current events. It was beyond it's time. The only thing I felt contrived was the relationship between Dunaway and Redford. When this movie was first screened, the Middle Eastern espionage must have appeared outlandish but for today's audience, it is very real. I am not going to go over the plot of the movie since other reviewers have done so. It it is worth viewing. If you like Robert Redford, you will like this movie. He's very sexy in the Navy Peacoat. Cliff Robertson is also very good in this movie."
3,OK -- kind of dated now.,"""Three Days of the Condor"" came out around the time of the Watergate scandal, and sort of begins the genre of spy flicks in which the US Government represents the bad guys instead of the good guys. The Watergate Era theme is hard to miss. Other things about this flick are dated. Redford holds an innocent woman prisoner in her own home, but its OK because hey, wouldn't most young women like to be held prisoner by Robert Redford? Well, at least Robert Redford back in his prime.This film was kind of interesting when it first came out due to its negative portrayal of the CIA and US Government. This kind of theme is now passe, and after seeing this film again after all these years, I have to say that this film is also somewhat passe. The book (""Six Days of the Condor"" -- mercifully, they cut the days in half for the movie) was better, actually. RJB."
4,3 Days of the Condor,"This is my father-in-laws favorite movie, although it isn't my cup of tea. After our VCR ate his VHS tape, I bought the DVD for him."
1,And the price is right!!!,Great movie but for $122.00 ??? I don't think so. If it's out of print they shouldn't even list it when it's priced this high. No one in their right mind would pay more than $20.00 for this film on any format!
2,not so great now,"So many clunkers and ""no way he would have done something that stupid.""Things you shouldn't do when running from the bad guys- leave by the same front door they came through, meet them in an alley, alone!, call them from your girlfriends (it's a stretch) house, drive your new girlfriend's car and be sure to jump into it in full site of bad guy chasing you with gun.I remembered liking this movie, opener is shocking, and love max von sydow but I must have been very young and bowled over by Robert Redford's shining blonde hair (and extremely tight pants!).Love the grainy look of these older movies. Much better than the polished films now."
1,Three Days of the Conder,This purchase was a disaster as I can't play it on my video because it will apparently only play on US or Canadian ones The vendor sent me a replacement but this to doesn't play on my machine. It would have been useful to have known this prior to ordering it
2,"to the writer of the review entitled ""an especially prescient film""","The many toubled, undemocratic areas of Africa don't have leaders that have sworn to stop at nothing until the United States is destroyed. Whether or not he actually had the capability to do so, the leader of Iraq did so swear and he did lead the world to believe that he had such capability. But thanks for commenting.As for the film, I know it won a couple Oscars and all, but I just didn't like it. I thought the editing was poor, that the scenes were long and often unnecessary. Although the story was good, a modern director would have put it together a lot better."
4,rare takes in this CD,"Wilma Goich has released several best hit albums before. This album is different from other ones. Because it has some rare takes.""LEI"" and ""ALLORA PRENDI E VAI"" are from the album ""TO WILMA G7"" that was released in 1981 : after her divorce. ""ALLORA PRENDI E VAI"" is well known as ""THE WINNER"" by ABBA. Wilma gives it italian lyrics.""CANTO D'AMORE DI HOMEIDE"" and ""L'AMICI MIA"" are from the album ""Le Vianella"" released in 1996. Why ""LE Vianella"" instead of ""I Vianella""? Wilma sings with her daughter Susanna Vianello. Susanna takes Edoardo Vianello's part. We cannot obtain these takes now in any other CDs.I offer this CD to everyone who wants to get all takes of Wilma Goich."
5,Great reference book for China fairings,"Fairings (because they were available at fairs) or bed pieces are small groups of gaily colored china figures made for Victorian fairgrounds mostly during the period 1860 to 1890. Despite growing popularity, little is known about them and nothing has previously been written.This book records the author's researches during a period of 30 years and it provides much information that was previously unknown. The fairings provide interesting evidence of the humor and sentiment appreciated by the Victorian masses who flocked to the fiargrounds. Each bears a caption like ""The last in bed to put out the light,"" and a tendency is evident for the themes to develop from bawdiness to sentimentality during the period they cover."
3,Look elsewhere,"Despite it's unusual layout and artful cover, this book comes across as a personal photo album. The snippets of saguaro lore do not justify the relatively high price, and the photography, while good, is defeated by the vertical format. Perhaps a better investment would be Carl Hodge's ""All About Saguaros"", which is referenced in the bibliography."
5,I love this product!,"I've lived in Atlanta, GA for five years and this is the first spring I have suffered from allergies. My doctor suggested Claritin or Allegra and I resisted because I'm not a fan of long term meds. I found this product at the local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try. I followed the instructions and was relieved the same day of a constant runny nose.I've been on Sabadil for less than two weeks and I feel great. My symptoms (watering eyes, runny nose and trouble sleeping) are gone. Best of all I don't have the side effects of allergy medication which usually makes me groggy and dries me out to the point I can't wear contacts."
5,IT REALLY WORKS!!!,"My husband and I have both been suffering for the last couple of weeks with HORRIBLE allergies!! It is especially bad this time of year for my husband. We simply could not stop sneezing and blowing our nose, along with itchy and watery eyes. I decided to venture out today and purchase the much talked about Sabadil, totally thinking that it WOULD NOT work!! We were wrong. We took the recommended dose right there in the parking lot of the health food store. As soon as the tablets dissolved, I noticed a difference. After taking the recommended dose of 8 tablets per hour, our symptoms were COMPLETELY gone!! I noticed that my sinuses dried up immediately and my sneezing stopped. What an AMAZING product. I can't say that everyone will experience the beautiful results that we did but it's worth trying!!"
2,Pleasant taste,"I was hopeful of the prospect of my allergies being ""cured"" without modern medicine. But alas, Sabadil did not work for me and I used as directed. But who knows, it may work for you. All you can do is try.On another note, I accidentally found that drinking 2+ cups of Yerba Mate everyday does work for me! So if this doesn't work, give Mate a try!"
1,Not for me,"I bought this product after hearing great things from a friend as well as reading quite a few good reviews. I followed the instructions and took 2 pills every 15 minutes for the first hour and then 3 times a day following. I feel worse today than I have been lately and I hadn't been taking any allergy medicine before I started this. It could just be me, but this product had zero effect and I likely wouldn't recommend it to anyone with severe allergies (like myself)."
1,These people are either nuts or work for this company.,"It doesn't work. Not even a smallest bit. I've tried 5 different homeopathic remedies for various symptoms with the same result.NOTHING, NADA. They are pointless, and quite expensive to try.The people who take these and say they work, are the same people that believe in reiki. It's rubbish.I really wanted to believe, I wish something could help my allergies. I have many 'hippie' friends who believe in all this nonsense, and i really started the think they knew what they are talking about.You've been warned by someone who actually studies for a living, and need results. Not by someone who believes in magic and mystic energy.Personally, i don't think claritin, zyrtec, or allegra work either. They work a tiny tiny bit more than this homeopathic nonsense. But not enough to justify the side effects.Go get local honey for hayfever."
4,two minor differences,"Actually, both previous reviews are almost correct.Instead of ""The Walk"" from the domestic release, this English version has ""The Caterpillar"" AND it also has an extra track: ""Pictures of You."" So this import disc has 19 tracks instead of the domestic 18. Ironically, ""Pictures of You"" is the Cure hit no getting airplay in an oft-repeated digital camera commercial here in the States.Of course, most Cure fans, like myself, will be buying this for the bonus Acoustic disc - but that disc is the same on both versions, hewing to the Domestic track listing. Not worth the extra bucks if you live in the U.S.Cheers!"
5,Barry Tuckwell,"Barry Tuckwell may be the best french horn player in the world. Mozart is Mozart, hard to beat. Put them together and you have a fantastic piece of music."
3,Little Loop Level Sophistication,"I regularly use a 3-3 Cover I Defense as an alternate way to face a one back double twins set on the high school level. I wanted to get a quick look at 3-5 variant to see how similar my system is to the standard 3-5, which is a defense that we will face at least twice this year.The presenter makes no misrepresentation and clearly states that this is s basic introduction to the defense. If you coach on the high school level you will find this DVD rather limited for your needs.If you are a Little Loop coach this DVD may offer you another way to defend a very popular offense and it could give you a real edge if the 4-2 Cover I or 4-3 Cover 0 is the main way to defend no TE sets in your league."
5,"Crackling dialogue, slick prose, daring ideas","Mike Pallagi's writing exhilarates me. I would rather read him than just about anyone published today. No kidding. He is, hands down, THE true wunderkind of the English language."
2,Planning Differently,"As a former english professor from Stetson University in Deland, Florida, I found Mr. Pallagi's work marginal at best. After reading the posted reviews I decided I would enjoy the exhiliration of something new and different for myself. Much to my dismay, I realized that I should have taken Mr. Pallagi's advice, and planned differently by selecting another book.The work, though thought provoking at times, had a kindergarten-like charm. The 10 short stories may be great for a creative wrting class in Junior Highschool, but nothing that I feel should be shared on a global scale. Please don't let me keep you from reading this work for yourself, but trust and old author when I tell you this, the Nutritional Information on a box of Milk Duds is more revealing."
1,Bad,So disappointed to see that this file was made in China. It is not nearly as good as the old U.S.A made file. Shame.
3,Not 2 sided,"The file is OK for shaping, but does NOT have a fine side to finish like I thought it would have. A bit disappointed about that. I wish they would make a two sided file. Revelon made one for years but I can no longer find them."
5,"It's sick, its twisted I loved it .....","Great CD its got a great remix of Just One Fix, and Jesus Built My hotrod is ok. The only problem with it is that it's lost the hard in-your-face beat that the original hotrod's had. Other than that it's a perfect CD for ministry fans 5 stars"
4,good,Bought for my mom. She really did love it. Very quick read. She will definitely give this book as a gift.
4,A More Objective Review,"Considering the only other review for this book currently available, I felt compelled to write a review that is actually about the book, not the subject of the book. A Harvard professor deserves at least that. Perry Miller's classic introduction to the New England Puritans remains an essential text for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of a much maligned and often misunderstood religious movement. An understanding of the New England Puritans is absolutely essential to an understanding of American History and American society. Miller does not espouse the doctrines of Puritanism; he provides a concise and helpful historical background and then guides the reader through some representative samples of their writing. This is not a book designed to convert someone to Puritanism. A sidenote: The Puritans referred to in this book have not existed for centuries, so I assure you no reviewer of this book actually left the Puritanism described in this book."
5,Testament just keeps on coming...,"This album is absolutely one of the best that I have ever heard. It has really heavy music, but under the complete control that Testament has. The vocals are really great to, leading towards the Demonic-type sound, but kind of in-between. I recomend this to ANYONE who likes heavy metal music. It's absolutely superb."
4,proof of testaments life after alex scholnick,"this cd was a test in many ways to see if they could still crush with out alex on guitar and the loss of louie clemete on drums and the verdict was yes but the drums are less than impressive john tepesta is a very fortunate drummer(anthrax tech,exodus,testament,white zombie and even a slayer temp/fill spot )john good and lucky but not great,I would have rather seen a more experienced drummer do this cd paul bostoph!as for the guitars JAMES MURPHy kills on guitar the man is great covering old testsment classics see live at the filmore and adds new crushing guitar toneS to this and takes them back to their roots.proof is that testament is reborn to thrash hard,-check out the gathering for more of murphy's guitar work"
3,Momentum.,"Momentum is what this album lacks above all else. The songs are solid for the most part but the overall flow of the CD moves in jumps and starts. However, when the music is good, it is very good, with Chuck Billy's vocals the most notable element. But there are some tracks that seem oddly out of place on a metal album. After hearing this album I wanted to put in ""The Gathering,"" a superior effort without a doubt. The fans like this album, but I'm enamored with ""The Gathering"" and ""Demonic,"" which are more Death Metal than simply Heavy Metal. It's just a matter of taste, I'm sure. Later."
5,Essential Thrash Metal,"I know Testament is a great band , this cd shows why! the entire cd kicks butt. This is one of my favorites from their long spanning career.Dog Faced Gods is a Killer track and one of the best songs ever in metal.If you like your Metal fast and hard then this is a ""Must Have"" for you~!"
1,"If I Wanted To Listen to Pantera, I'd buy one of their CD's","I'm sorry but this album is TERRIBLE!!!! After Metal MASTERPIECES like ""Practice What You Preach"" this album was a bitter disappointment. I was concerned about the band when Alex left, but figured Eric Peterson had written alot of the music so they would probably be okay. BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!! Apparently Alex was the one resposible for the melodic elements of Testaments earlier works because there sure isn't any of that in this release or ""Demonic"" for that matter. I guess if you like that Pantera type music, i.e. - the lead ""singer"" doesn't sing, just shouts along to music with no melodic flow to it whatsoever - then by all means this album is for you. I will stick with my old Testament, thank you very much!"
3,Japanese Hentai Song Title,"Ha,ha, Does Anyone Know That Urotsukidoji is A Japanese Animated Film filled with violence and other naughty stuff? I just happened to noticed this song and get this album. The Song Even has a scene from the movie at the beginning in the background. (plus japanese voices in the background) A Decent album I guess."
5,Outstanding,"The Charlie's Angels Casebook is a great piece of work. I got it and finished it, in one day. Couldn't put it down. After reading it, I wanted more. Gives you all the information you need to be an Angels' fan. Thumbs up!"
1,gimme a break,Ok I love Charlies angels as much as the next... but this book is lame. Just as I watched each week enjoying yet hoping the plots would get better this book is the same. Just reading and waiting for it to get better.Basically there is nothing you havent heard before. I would sell my copy for a buck plus shipping.
5,Charlies Angels Casebook-a great fans book,"This is a wonderful informative book, with rare pictures and a behind the scenes look into Charlies Angels. Whether you are a fan of Charlies Angels or one of the cast---i believe you will find this book a great read. Very enlightening, with facts not normally known to the public. an A+"
4,Worked,"It worked, even had wires for slots my 2000 Focus's wiring harness didn't have. Only 4 stars because I wish it had been cheaper."
2,Beware,"I ordered two cartriges back in August. One I opened right after I received it. The other I opened when the first one finished and found out that it was broken into two parts. The cartridge was sealed and looked normal in the package, so there is no way to see if it is broken unless you break the black plastic wrap. Of course I can not return it with free shipping and need to pay my own shipping to replace it. For the price of the cartrige it is not worth it. The fact is you will need to open each one and ispect it even though you will not need it at the time, just to be sure it is in good condition. Just beware."
2,doesnt work for the k800i,nice concept and all but it will not work on my phone the K800i nothing i do will make it work. all i can get is a data transfer mode but thats it no charging or anything.i was going to return it but didnt want to bother. But luck would have it it works on my sisters boyfriends phone i forget which model so i guess it wasnt a complete waste. I give it a 2 because it works for my sisters boyfriends phone i give it a -3 because i was lead to beleive it works for the k800i
2,Too Much Sun,"Robert Downey, Sr.-directed movies are not for everyone -- the production is rather cheap, the ideas are sometimes small and simple compared to those of the usual Hollywood film -- but he does let his actors go to town. Oddly, the prostitute and Robert Downey, Jr.'s character are the only ones with any sense of reality, and that's only relatively speaking."
1,Horrible,"It's hard to imagine how a movie this bad could have been made. To see talents like Andrea Martin and Eric Idle wasted is bad enough, but to have to watch Robert Downey turn his Ham-it-up dial up and up again is sickening. Should be airdropped into Iraq instead of bombs.How bad is this movie? It is out of print at a time when Columbia/Tristar is re-releasing everything on DVD. It is just plain horrid horrid horrid."
2,Dissapointed,Had never heard of pal before so i dont have anything that plays it. Maybe that my fault but i wish there would have been some sort of warning for that. Otherwise delivery service wasnt bad.
2,"HOT HOT HOT, I should of given this baby 1 Star","Its my CADILLAC B17*%, so stop scewin' wit my head. Bass Gasm gave me a BASS HEADACHE and my girlfriend A Vibration Orgasm with that HUUUUUGE DROP. I cant believe this stuff, Ill i'm runnin is 3 tens and 1 fifteen and my damn drunk just bout blew OFF!"
3,Kings of Rave,"Ultra Sonic had a long and varied career and this was one of their lower musical triumphs,still worth a listen though purley for its ultra fast break beats and mesmorizing catchiness. A great all round album."
1,biggest piece of junk,"We bought this toy for Christmas and the center ""100"" point mark was not properly sewn on, it came off in minutes. Before we could even put it away the red outer shell was torn. The balls stick too tightly onto the mat, even the adults had a hard time removing them. I threw the piece of junk into the garbage. It is absolutely the worst toy I have ever purchased."
2,red dart ball,Product is of good quality but the velcro balls stick soo well that it is difficult for a 6 yr old to remove the balls. I also think the product is wayyy overpriced
4,"Great ideas, suggestions and pictures","Great book - full of ideas, suggestions, pictures and advice. Gives inspiration as well as information."
1,Disappointing,A very disappointing book filled with many outdated pictures from magazines years ago. Lacking anything new and inspirational.
4,An Excellent Book,"Mariane Pearl does a remarkable job writing about her life and relationship with Daniel Pearl, his kidnapping and death, and her journey afterwards."
4,MIGHTY AND COURAGEOUS,"I truly admire people like the Pearls, Mariane and Danny, who have the courage and strength to go into these unfriendly foreign countries for honest reporting, and they always seem to maintain an attitude of possibly making things better between cultures and countries. All of the stress and tension happened to Mariane while she was pregnant and yet she still managed to have a happy, healthy child. Her fortitude and humility were inspiring for any human and she came through probably exactly like Danny would have if the roles had been reversed. I liked her and wish her the best - a very brave, impressive woman."
5,Very sad,"A very sad story. It also makes the anger towards these terrible people come out. I wish that Bush would stop being a sissy and go after these people. I also lost my husband but to an auto accident. Nevertheless, the pain is the same. I would hope that her story will stop people from going to these countrys for any reason. The US also needs to be more militant in going after the hostage takers."
3,The book is better.,"I could barely understand a word she said because of her think French accent. I really could not enjoy the story because I was straining to understand her. The story was touching, but I would recommend the book instead."
3,"Great story of courage and love, but who wrote this?","The problem I have with this book is it was written with the head (the co-writer's perhaps?) and not much from the heart. The prose is controlled and polished, too well written, too structured, too objective. I would like to ""hear"" Mariane's voice, but this book is more an anatomy of a murder. Only the authors know who actually did the writing, my guess is not Mariane."
4,A Surprisingly Good Read,"I just finished reading ""A Mighty Heart,"" and confess I was pleasantly surprised. Mariane Pearl has a wonderful voice, and the book was a real page-turner. Her courage is admirable, and I recommend everyone buy this book!"
4,Reads like a thriller,"A Mighty Heart exceeds expectations. Author Mariane Pearl has a knack for bringing you a living, breathing Danny Pearl and a feel for the loving, playful relationship they shared together up until his kidnapping. Even though you know the ending to the story, the reader gets caught up in the drama and suspense of trying to find out what happened and the chase to save him from a terrible fate. The revelation that he is already dead feels like a kick in the gut. The posthumous birth of Daniel Pearl's son Adam is quite moving, as are the letters she received from ordinary people and world leaders mixed together at the end. Mariane Pearl studiously avoids anything political -- though you can sense her rage at the heartlessness and barbarism of her husband's captors. The book includes a surprisingly moving story of her meeting with First Lady Laura Bush. I highly recommended this book to read and discuss."
1,disappointed,"I quite was quite disappointed after reading this book. It seems to simply be a money maker, where anything that is written even if false is thrown into this book. I have read so many other books like these, sob story then a movie deal, then the talk show circuit. I can guarantee that right now Daniel Pearl is no where on Marianne's mind.She is more likely to be checking the figures of her bank account. If anyone truly cared to investigate, Sheikh Gilani was cleared of having ANY involvement in Daniel Pearl's abduction and murder."
1,Math Book,The book was the only one rated excellent in condition. Consequently was the highest price of all 10 available. When the book was received the lettering on the spine and front was unreadable and worn. I believe the rating was misleading and does not give me a good feeling about your selling process. It was also not the latest edition. Bob Conley
2,Reformulated or defetive?,"This product appears quite different from the Armor All products available at local retailers. The product received barely pours out of the plastic bottle and it seems to be more like a soap product than a rubber or vinyl protectant.It is questionable as to whether this advertised product has been reformulated by the manufacturer or whether it is simply a matter that a defective product was shipped.In any event, this is not the Armor All I have been using for more than twenty years and it certainly does not represent any price savings over Target or other retailers."
3,Free shipping,"Hello, I am unhappy with this purchase. I wanted one bottle of ArmorAll but was misled into buying two bottles. The site said if I make a minimum purchase I will get free shipping so I bought two bottles, which I surely did not need, but did it anyway to meet the requirement for free shipping.I figured the shipping could go toward the purchase of the second bottle, I'm sure you can see where this is going, they charged me shipping anyway.Misleading people with free shipping is not the way to promote future sales.I hope I'm not writing this to deaf ears, just to be deleted, I'm sure you're looking for positive feed back but I can't think of anything positive about this misleading practise. Except for this purchase I am happy with Amazon. It's too bad that for this one sale that Amazon would have a blemish on a good reputation.I wasn't going to complain I figured it wasn't worth the trouble but then you sent me an email.Thank you very muchEdward Pavis"
5,Brilliant,"I adore Sheila Nichols. Her CD Wake is by far the best CD I have heard in years. She could be the next Tori Amos except for the fact that she's in a league of her own. An original. Like Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Ani Difranco Shelia Nichols' and Corinna Fugate's lyrics are provocative, thoughtful, her melodies are like pieces of sky."
5,A Breathtaking Talent!!,"It was completely by chance that I stumbled across Sheila Nicholls, but ever since she has been at the absolute forefront of what I see as true musicianship. Her songs are an insight into emotion and both her albums: Wake and Brief Strop, have been an enrichment for me. She has managed to take over such greats as Alanis Morissette and No Doubt as my all-time favourite artist. Sheila is a true talent, and if I was to recommend any singer to anyone, it would be her. Buy this album!!"
3,Nice Recording in her late career,This is a relaxing recording for Caterina. I enjoyed listening to the first few songs but got impassion quickly due to the slow pace of all the songs. The usually alive Caterina sings in her sleep in this album
4,ROCK ON,"well, the first time i heard ""Insect"", i was well, i don't know, i thought it was people just trying to be stupid...but after listening to it a few times i relized that it was not so bad, and actually quite entertaining...the one thing i will say about these cats, is their HEART...these guys deserve the deepest amount of respect from all of us...A fresh sound from these guys, and i hope to hear more from them!"
4,A decent effort...,"This album is a decent effort. The singing sounds messy at times, but it's still a fun album to listen to. I find it inspiring that these kids actually wrote their own songs. Music projects like this help them realize their potential, and they seem to have lots of it."
2,THESE KIDS RULZ,"really there prettty cool but not that good, but still it's fun to listen to sometimes. so if you want to get it do! 1 there fun."
5,Body Lift,Excellent tape it is segmented into body part sections which mean you can do the whole tape or if you are injured just the sections you want. I am a regular gym junkie and was surprised at the amount of muscle fatigue and lactic build up I got from doing this tape. Highly recommend.
4,Advanced,"I believe I've done about ninety percent of all of Kathy Smith's videos, and for a good reason. Her workouts are well thought out and well planned, and the most effective.I believe this video was more challenging than most of her other muscle toning videos because of the intricacy of the movements. The movements are very slight, but they are more intense and the angles are more awkward.Because the exercises are more unconventional than other videos, it provides a nice change. However, one must be careful about hurting themselves while doing this workout (i.e., knees). The individual workouts themselves are not long, but they are intense. They work your muscles in directions they don't normally go."
5,Nice strength DVD,This is a wonderful departure to the strength DVD's I currently own. I enjoy the isometrics. As always Kathy instructs the proper technique and reminds you to keep good form though out the pose/exercise. The first time I did the DVD I could feel the areas I worked on (good new)!This is a great addition to an all around workout regimen.
4,Great toning Workout,"This along with the Maxtrix DVD are my favorite Kathy Smith fitness videos. The moves are very challening and if you are un-coordinated like me, you may have to view/practice a couple times before you get it down. I will say that I feel sore right where we worked the muscles. I do this once a week on my ""toning"" non-cardio days. A great addition to my fitness library!"
5,excellent strength and toning workout,This is one of my favorit strength and toning workouts (and I have many)! I was so surprised that I could get such a challenging workout by using such light weights! Definitely great for solid toning without bulking up too much! I also train for/compete in triathlons--this DVD is great for my in-season training when training with heavy weights can really wear me down.
5,workout at home,I thought this DVD was just what I needed. Some of the repetitions are too fast and some there just aren't enough of them. Good body alignment also needs to be stressed with some of the poses. Otherwise I'm glad to have this DVD in my library....
5,Excellent Reference Book,If you are looking for a book on dealing with real world XSLT scenarios and organized accordingly by scenario. This is the book for you. Jeni (Author) is by far one of the leading XSLT experts out there. It is rare you find someone that can explain complex topics in a manor that is both concise and readable. Buy this book and it will stay with you through any project you are using XSLT on.
2,Very disapponited,"I bought the book because of the 4.5+ rating on Amazon. But this book is a complete waste of money, it lacks any in-depth stuff needed by a professional, the author does not seem to have the calibre to write something which is really beyond the obvious, all he seems to know is some VB stuff."
3,Very slight book,"I bought this book with hope to undendstand changes came from IIS4, especially Component Services(former MTS) I wondered that this important topic absolutely is not covered in the book, but instead of that a lot of space is wasted for ASP beginners. Very slight book."
2,Superficial,"I have to agree with the comments concerning the superficiality of this book. If you understand what the author is discussing then you don't need this book except perhaps as a reference. If you don't understand the topic there is very little explanation that will help you. Please be aware that the author is extremely MS biased and works entirely in Front Page and VBscript. Statements like ""...there are a plethora of hackers who are continuously trying to discredit Microsoft and its products..."" (p148) are deplorable."
2,Needs An Editor; Reads Like A Term Paper,"Friend presents an interesting, well-researeched theory regarding Jimmy Page and the other 3 members of Led Zeppelin being devil-worshippers with an implicit conversion agenda manifested through their music. He's done his homework, particularly with respect to Crowley and his writings. HOWEVER...this book is one laborious read. He goes on and on and on and on, citing all sorts of evidence for his theory, some plausible, some bordering on the ludicrous. No editor is mentioned or indicated, and I would bet my bottom dollar that the work was not redacted in any way, shape, or form prior to going to press. As a result, it suffers. This book could be pared down to half its weighty 600-plus page length and make a better read without sacrificing any of the author's premise. As it is now, you better have a pot of coffee brewing before you sit down with this tome."
1,What a waste of my time and money!,"I cannot believe that someone put this much time into tearing apart every single Led Zeppelin fan, song, and move. He goes way out of whack talking about how everything that Zeppelin does (and the people that like them) pertains to the devil. I am sorry that I spent my money on this item and have tossed it in the trash. What a waste of paper."
1,What a piece crap this book turned out to be!!!!!,Don't waste a dime unless you are prone to believe in nonsense and hearsay. This author is one of the worst ever read and this book is at the very bottom of the list of all books ever read in my life! What a pretentious religious nut-case he turned out to be. And I was under the very mistaken impression this was going to be a good biography. Well my chimnea does use starter paper so setting it on fire would be at least some productive use for this worthless book!
2,Dogmatic and reaching,"The author certainly has done research into the occult, but it is comic how he comes up with demonic explanations for most everything Zeppelin did in their career."
2,This Book Is a Silver out of Gold,"At first when I discovered this book I thought, I will love this. BUT, when I got almost half way through it, I was just couldn't handle reading the personal life of Aleister Crowley. I mean he is a person with feelings, so I don't mean to bring him down. I just couldn't stand this read anymore. i gave up. I am going to get Chronicles of the Host: Exile of Lucifer. That book is more what I expected Fallen Angel to be like."
1,Fallen Angel: The Untold Story of Jimmy Page,"Title is false advertising.It is about Crowley, satan and the tarot...Page and Plant's names are scattered here and there. Nothing ""Untold"" here, anyone even barely enchanted with Jimmy Page has already discovered Crowley, etc. Great book for Christians againt Rock, other then that it is rubbish and I think Page should sue the author for using his name to profit. Biggest laugh, Friend thinks Page is going to read this book !!Within 24 hours of purchasing book, sent it on to Goodwill."
1,Bad Cables equal bad DVD playback!!,"I bought these cables hoping for outstanding video from my PS2, but in return I got the worst video playback since the invention of the VHS tape. DVD playback makes actors looks like silhoettes anytime they are in a dark area with light from behind...it is like someone turned the brightness off, and put the contrast on high!!Don't spend money on these...unfortunatly Amazon is not carrying the MonsterCable Gamelink 300 as of yet...otherwise I'd have them on the way to my house now!Mz K. in Austin, TX"
4,not yer toddler's turtles,"I can't tell if the other ""pop-up"" review is an excellent joke, or a stupid mistake. In either case, do a little googling on Kevin Eastman's Bodycount and you'll find that the only things ""popping out"" in this book are bad guys' eyeballs and babe's bazungas... aka NOT for kids 3 - 6.The book is a completely different take on the turtles, presented in a hyper-violent, hyper-sexualized style. The art is impressive and is certainly worth the read for a turtle vet who wants to appreciate the full spectrum of the TMNT, from goof to gore (this being of the gore variety). It will certainly wash the candy-coated-cowabunga-cartoon-turtle-taste out of your mouth if anything... plus it's turtle founding father Kevin Eastman's swan-song (or rather swan-rampage) to the TMNT - his last main turtle work before he signed over all the rights to collaborator Peter Laird."
1,Poor Quality Craftsmanship,"First thing I noticed when I opened Heavy Metal's reprint of TMNT Bodycount was the sound of the spine of the book cracking as the cheap glue holding it together started falling apart. This thing is not well made. On top of that my copy had page 38 reprinted on page 36. I was completely confused as to what was happening in the story until I noticed the error. The story is ultra-violent, over-exaggerated, gun-porn, starring one of the turtles and Casey Jones and really isn't all that great anyway. I could have lived with that if not for the crappy quality of the physical book itself."
5,I believe in Christ,"At our Ward Christmas dinner last night, this book was narrated. It is perfect, spiritually uplifting, and a very appropriate story. Our Ward loved it, and the Primary children sang songs to complement it. Another 8 brethren sang duets and solos of O Come O Come Emmanuel and We Three Kings. Another 3 pianists played music. And a brother played a duet on his small tuba with a piano, and 2 brethren played Silent Night on their acoustic, amplified guitars. All of it was blended with this lovely book's story. One of best Ward Christmas programs EVER!"
4,Beautiful parallels.,"I love this gem of a book. It's very short and very simple, but it draws a beautiful parallel between Santa Claus and Jesus Christ. With beautiful illustrations and explanations of the symbols of Christmas, this is a wonderful addition to any collection of Christmas books. Fun for children to look at and easy for them to read. Santa Claus is a wonderful symbol of Christmas and I, for one, believe in Santa Claus."
5,Superb Teaching Tool,"We were looking for something that we could use to link Christmas to... Christ. At first I was a little taken back by the simplicity of the text, but after reading is several times, I've found that the simplicity is intentional. The simple statements, just a few words to a page, follow a clear line of thought, and are designed to help the reader teach and make a point. It is NOT a book for pure entertainment. It IS a book for someone that just needs an extra tool to teach a lesson, and does not expect that tool to do all the work.The illustration is superb and also does a great job. The religious imagery is not distracting (like crucifixion pictures that really go for blood,) but helps convey the importance of the subject matter. I strongly recommend the book as it's done great things for our efforts to keep our kids focused on Christ over commercial. After all, it's not the commercial that builds anything worthwhile."
5,"Uplifting, encouraging way to be with the Angels and God","The cards are inspiringly illustrated and the affirmations truly uplifting. The accompanying book draws knowledge from previous writings about angels and the author's own experiences. It also explains clearly how to use the cards for guidance and inspiration. I was skeptical at first, but my very first experience using the cards, using a Single Card Spread was so uncanny that I am now a firm believer. I drew the exact same angel card in two separate ""draws""! All the cards are positive and encouraging. The Angel Oracle is a wonderful guide and means of communicating with Angels and getting closer to the will of God."
5,Wonderful,"This is the first angel oracle deck/book I ever bought and I still use it. I love the artwork. The book is excellent on it's own. I have never had a reading with these cards that was bad or un-true. They always come up right. I would recomend this deck to anyone looking for an accurate oracle. If you've never bought angel oracle cards before, I recomend you start with this deck. The spreads listed are easy to remeber and the cards are beautiful and accurate. The info for each card is easy to understand. But like I said I would recomend this to anyone - beginner or advanced."
5,Excellent Guidance!,The Angel Oracle has given me guidance on countless occasions. It has helped me with everything from relationships to self-doubting to school. I would never give it up for anything!
3,Broading Ones Horizon,I read this book as a young adult. I had always loved the SVH series and I found the book and read it again last night. I think the book did its best to introduce interracial dating. Interracial dating was becoming more popular at the time and I like the idea how Francine Pascal decided to take the angel from Steven dating the black girl. You didn't see the possibilities then and now its still some what the same. In high school white girls are more open to dating black guys. However white males are secretly attracted to black women but are more timid in regards to emotional feelings for them. If we as a world are going to show children equality as a whole. We need to be more open minded and up front about our feelings and curiosity. I admit this book back in 1993 was start for high schoolers
3,Are We In Love?,"This is an ok book. It's not as good as some others in the series, but it was good. Basically people think that Steve is going out with this neighbor girl, but they're not really. So they do decide to go out though, because everyone already thinks they are."
2,Repair is very difficult,"You should know that if an Olevia product breaks in any way, you have to ship it to the factory yourself. In Massachusetts, and many other states I'm sure, there are is no one who will repair Olevia products. Remember this before you are seduced by their low prices. And shipping isn't cheap."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I PURCHASED THE 232 MODEL IN 2008. AFTER ONE YEAR AND ONE MONTH THE TUNER BOARD WAS FRIED.ORDERED AND PAID FOR NEW TUNER BOARD $200+. NOW THE TUNER BOARD IS GONE AGAIN. DO NOT BUY ANY OLEVIA PRODUCT. I TRIED TO CALL THE 800 NUMBER AND REC'D THE RCORDING SAYING THEY NO LONGER SERVICE ANY PRODUCTS. IF YOU GO TO THEIR WEB SITE, THEY ONLY SEEM TO LIST OFFICES IN HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE. APPARENTLY THE PRODUCT WAS SO BAD THEY HAVE PULLED THE PLUG AND ARE NO LONGER IN THE US.DO NOT BUY........"
2,Nice picture whenworking,"After having this product for 5 months, the picture went dead and volume wasn't always working. Kept taking longer and longer to actually turn on and I could only tell this when the volume was working since picture was already out. Called Syntax customer service and they notified me I had to ship my old tv back to them so they could look at it. Took 3 weeks for them to ship the tv back (with a different remote, not sure why). Worked like normal again for about 2 days. Volume doesn't always work. But I didn't bother to call syntax back since it was a pain. I recommend not buying this tv or buying a very long warranty from the store. Looking for another tv and spending the extra money for a better brand, like LG or Sony)."
4,GREAT HDTV - GREAT PRICE,"My only issue with this purchase has nothing to do with the actual TV but with the seller. Their return policy was a little questionable and unreasonable. I realize that Amazon uses third party sellers to get the best price for their customers, but more has to be done to ensure that the return policies of these third party sellers is more in-line with Amazon's own return policies."
1,hopeful!,"I received the item in a very short amount of time - good service that way. Unfortunetly for me, the TV only worked some of the time, seemed like it had a short or something - it was electronically challenged! Anyway, Discount Jungle sent me a postage paid return label and are supposedly sending me a new one, and I am hopeful that the new one will work all of the time! I loved it when it worked!"
5,Olevia means value,"That's what it means! I've had mine for about a year. No problems, great picture, average sound (you always need a home stereo or surround system to get the best from TV sound). Menus take a little getting used to. Just one HDMI port for your DVD or BD player - so get a multiple switcher if you need more. Most of us don't.At $600 currently, this is a steal. I paid nearly $800 then. You can spend two or three times as much and get a little more, but not much more. If you already have a much bigger screen TV, this will be great for another room. If this is your choice for a first digital HD 1080i TV, congratulations - you are on the right page.No paper user manual. Upgradable ROM via USB port. Make your relatives and neighbors jealous that they paid so much more for a lesser performing HD TV."
4,Olevia 32'',"I have been very impressed with this purchase. The only flaw Ive found is that it fails to recognize my hdmi input directly after switching from component. I have to scroll thru the inputs, going back by component and to hdmi the second time and it works. If you can overlook that, then it is a great buy.."
2,obscure instructions,"I bought an olevia 32 inch and while I like many things about it, the jacks available on the back have no real markings for use that I understand. It should be in everyone speak, not tech speak or for those used to the new terms. I use a/v cables, and while there are sound jacks for the red and white ends, where the heck is the video? also, it is totally not compatible with my magnavox [new] dvd player/recorder.the manual that came with it is written in such a way as to be the least helpful possible. and the cd which I thought would have more info is simply the electronic format of the no help manual. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless all you do is watch tv and use nothing else people have begun to use tv's for."
4,Great picture. Beware of remote control issues.,Excellent picture but a little complicated to initially set up.Major drawback is that this TV is so new that there are no Brighthouse cable box remote control codes. So I have to fumble with two remotes. Cable box controller will not adjust the volume or turn the TV on/off.
2,not so good,"Well, I have seen the One Interactive Show book, and quite amazed with what I have seen, so I expected the same visual richness from this book, but I was wrong. This book mainly focuses on dull, not-so-cool websites. Ofcourse, as we all know there is more to interactive design than web design, but this book doesn't have that broader perspective."
4,A solid if not brilliant effort,"Simon Clark is one of my favorite authors in the horror genre. Blood Crazy, King Blood, and Vamphyrric are all superb, unique, and amazing works. Darker, like his first novel Nailed by the Heart, suffers from a certain vagueness that occasionally crops up in Clark's work.The characters here must face an overwhelming evil force and though we grow to like our protagonists, I found it difficult to truly understand them. Every so often someone would do something I found completely out of character, merely in an effort to serve the story line. Clark shows his hand a bit too much in this one, though the novel remains a gripping read. You simply might be left with too many questions at the end of it."
3,Probably Clark's Worst Novel,"I've read most of Simon Clark's novels, even going so far as to order British hardcovers of the more recent ones, and most of what I've read has been very promising. Clark is one of the strongest writers to enter the horror field in a long time, maybe since Clive Barker first broke on the scene with his Books of Blood. That said, I have to say I was rather disappointed by _Darker_. This is a rather silly novel, with characters that are pretty one-dimensional. The whole ""invisible force"" that must be kept under control, lest it start to hammer people and objects flat, has to be one of the stranger plots for a horror novel. I can't fault Clark for his originality here. Unfortunately, he doesn't do much with this idea and the book just doesn't match up to the amazing heights of his other work. Check out _Vampyrrhic_ or _Blood Crazy_ first. Wait until you're a Clark fanatic and must read everything he's written before you try _Darker_."
4,My 100-word book review,"Darker is a horror novel with a difference. As with Clark's first story Nailed by the Heart, there is a family unit under threat, but this time the menace is an implacable, incredibly violent force of nature which pursues the characters like something out of the movie Forbidden Planet. A monster from the id! At times the writing stops and starts, just like the car in the story, and people occasionally act out of character where the plot demands, but there are some extremely tense moments, and Clark manages on the whole to make the entire nightmarish scenario horribly real."
2,"Clark, Darker","Simon Clark is an author that I just can't seem to like. Darker is another failed attempt on my part to enjoy his work with the exception of The Tower. I thought I would love a novel about a force that chases down and literally crushes people flat but this, like most of the Clark novels I've read, just seemed sooooooooooooo drawn out and I wanted it to end. There comes a point in certain books where it becomes a challenge to me to finish and that's when I decide it is a bad book. This one was especially difficult because I had already read a couple bad novels by this guy. Still, I am a horror fan and I have time to get to all of it before I die, at least hopefully, and I'm glad I read Darker even though I pretty much hated it. I will give it credit for having a grabbing beginning and some gruesome descriptions of deaths but that's about all I got out of it."
4,Excellent capturing of the genre and history...,"I've always been a sucker for the ""Gals that made the Big Bands swing"". Their voices are so pure, the songs are simple and the orchestral support makes them a gem in history. This recording is the best of its type, as I think it's the only one that focuses on the Big Band gals. The cross-section of artists is excellent...from Peggy Lee to Tilton to Billie.I do have one criticism of this recording though - the overall production quality. The CD inserts are very drab and you can tell the label that produced this disc isn't swimming in money. The silkscreen effort on the CD is pitiful. There were also a few mixing/balancing issues with some songs being way louder than the previous. It get annoying having to adjust the volume each song.All in all I give the concept FIVE BIG STARS, but the disc itself only gets three. This could have been so much better, but I'm enjoying it nonetheless :)"
2,I agree with below poster NOT VERY GOOD!!,"It's a pity Kodak in Australia aren't as Customer Service Focused as they are with the below poster. I bought a Max HQ Camera and the Flash didn't work, I called Customer Service to complain and they were of no help and wanted me to send the Camera back with a Letter. No replacement, nothing, just attitude!I've used these Kodak Max HQ Cameras two other times in 2002, The results have been Poor, Washed out Colours, as the Person mentioned below...Poor reproduction of Skin Tones. Hey I'm White, but I'm not THAT White!! Unless Kodak bring out a better One Time Use Camera soon I'm going to start buying another Brand, maybe Agfa or Fuji."
1,Don't buy this piece of junk!,"We bought two of these for our first trip to NYC. The pictures were grainy, washed out and just plain awful. We bought the more expensive cameras thinking the pictures would be even better than the cheaper one time cameras. We were so wrong. I contacted Kodak's customer service and they said it was either the photographer or the developer. Then they generously mailed me a $2 off coupon to buy another. As if I will buy another one of their cameras!! I will never use another Kodak product after the treatment I received from their customer service."
2,Not very good!,"I've used many Kodak products, including a variety of their disposable cameras. When the Max HQ came out, I thought, wow, if their other disposable cams take pretty good pics, this one must take great ones! Unfortunately, I was wrong. I have to say that the pictures I got from this camera are pretty bad. Washed out, grainy, tons of red-eye. For the extra cost of this camera compared to their others, I was disappointed. I will not be purchasing this product again.Update: I contacted Kodak customer support to express my disappointment and they quickly responded by e-mail and also mailed me a new One-Time-Use camera (not the Max HQ!) which I received in 3 days after sending the e-mail! Their customer support definitely gets an A++++++!"
3,A Suitable Camera for Fun Times,"June 11, 2002 - The Kodak MAX HQ One time Use Camera.Personally I wouldn't call this Camera ""Kodak's Best Ever Disposable Camera"" as the Box Suggests, the results IMO were pretty much the same as the Previous 'Yellow' Kodak MAX Dispobable Camera model... WITHOUT the Ektanar Lens. I've found Photo's taken Outside in Daylight with this Camera turn out Excellent when Developed. However, the Indoor Shots even with the Flash, especially at Night have turned out very Average showing a Bright Subject with an almost Pitch Black Background despite plenty of light behind the Person/Subject at the time of Photographing. A great Camera for capturing Spontaneous Funtimes with Above Average Results, but if you plan to attend a Special Event and want VERY good Photos at the end of the Day I suggest a Proper Non-Disosable Kodak 35mm Camera."
1,Do not buy a Staples shredder,I just had my third Staples shredder die on me. The store let me exchange the first two. I'm not going to bother exchanging this one because I have no doubts that the fourth one will just die in a few months anyway.I'd rather just buy a different brand that works. If I could give it zero stars I would.I will not be buying any Staples brand office products again. Save yourself a lot of frustration and hassle and do not buy this shredder.
1,Broke On First Use,Plastic teeth broke upon first usage and vendor will leave you high and dry. I called Staples and this product is from 2005 and has been discontinued and storage by vendor is questionable. I've used shredders before and this vendor is not amiable to resolutions. Buyer beware.
3,Leslie Sansone-Walk Aerobics for the Family,The workout content of this video is good. I found that the ongoing talking and laughing with the members of the video during the workout to be a bit distracting. I bought this video because I work out with my 2yr old in the room and would have loved to see the kids in the front.
3,Promising talent that needs better material,"Erin has a beautiful voice -- that cannot be disputed. My complaint with this album is the choice of material. With the exception of the first song and the cover of Simon's ""Graceland,"" these songs blur into one set of same-sounding, bland tunes. And there really isn't a chance for us to hear if Erin can swing because the material is set perpetually below the speed limit. And while Mr. Maness' song ""Holiday"" seems inspired, the rest seem composed for rainy days or coffee shops. Come on -- pull your Bobby Hutcherson or Andrew Hill albums out and start gathering ideas for harmonically sophisticated, interesting music for Erin to sing! Hearken back to King Pleasure and put words to a hard bop tune -- maybe write lyrics to Jackie McLean's ""Who Killed Cock Robin."" You guys are talented -- grab Steve Elf, Mulgrew Miller, and Steve Wilson, and do something interesting!"
3,A coupla Really good ones...,"The star of this tribute's show is the Flipper cover. I'd buy this disk again, just for that. The SouR cover, what's the matter with kids today, is also very cool. If you are a NOFX fan this is a good one for the collection."
2,"30 min. is not suficient to show ""All About Helicopters"".","The title ""All About Helicopters"" must be changed to ""SomeThing About Helicopters""... :("
2,Music for the masses,"Stylized modern rockabilly. Bought this based on other reviews and was very disappointed. As heartless and overwrought as most Brian Setzer tunes. Less posture and more twang, please."
2,Muti runs over Mahler during rush hour,"Riccardo Muti was the great hope among young conductors for EMI in the Eighties, but he never caught on with the public, and now his many recordings languish in super-budget land. He is a charmless interpreter whose tendency is either to be rigid and fierce or else bland and slack, depending on his mood. He never assayed any work of Mahler's beyond this proficient, hasty Sym. #1, which is almost astonishing in its impatience and complete lack of sympathy with Mahler's idiom. Een with the gorgeous Philadelphia Orch. playing quie well, thre's no humor, nuance, insight, or joy -- just a fast rush-hour traversal that wastes everyone's time. EMI's early digital sound is clear but edgy at the top. A definite pass except for lovers of the orchestra"
5,one of the best albums from one of the best bands - EVER,"What can be said to top the numerous fabulous reviews on this page?These guys created unmatchable imaginitive intellectual masterful music during an era of very tough competition.34 yrs later, one never tires of the emotional high attained while listening to anything the Real Genesis created - Lamb Lies Down and before. Foxtrot is an absolute masterpiece. I remember the days where Rodney Bingenheimer would play Suppers Ready on KROQ 106.7 (in Los Angeles). that was before the Bean Counters destroyed the music industry. Imagine a station having the nerve to play a 20 minute song with no commercials today. Good luck.Buy this, you absolutely will not be disapointed. This is Music with a capital M."
4,Genesis - Foxtrot CD,"This is a seminal record by the original Genesis - before they descended to pop/tatty end of things. Superb instrumentation, good use of backing musicians, fabulous, challenging lyrics. Seems ageless."
2,Not all that,"The long glossy reviews are sympathetic writings of people with fond memories of the past. I'm an encyclopedic collector of many bands from the era, and this one is frankly, not all that.Foxtrot simply shows it age. You're bound to be disappointed. I would recommend ""Selling England by the Pound"" over this, unless you are a sentimentalist from the 70's"
1,I'm sorry but this one STINKS !!!!,"I bought it, listened to it (yawner) and then gave it away. what a waste of money. there are much better cd's out. I would call this Fox-fodder."
5,Iconic.,"This is one of the seminal prog-rock releases of all time. In fact, it is one of the greatest albums ever released. From the opening Mellotron intro of ""Watcher of The Skies"" to the intensely dramatic closing of ""Supper's Ready"" you will be spellbound. Those who think of Genesis as the pop band they became in the 80's will no doubt start a path of discovery that will lead you to their other Gabriel-era classics which include ""Trespass"", ""Nursery Cryme"", ""Selling England By The Pound"" and ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"". Then go for the early Collins-vocal era with more meaty releases such as ""A Trick of the Tail"", ""Wind and Wuthering"", ""Seconds Out"", ""And Then There Were Three"" and ""Duke"". After ""Duke"" Genesis started to really cash in and as a result ""dumbed"" the music down to appeal to the masses. Foxtrot is the epitome of what Genesis was all about in their hey-day!Buy this album and give it the attention it deserves. You will be rewarded for your efforts."
3,Good Place To Start With Early Genesis,"Good early-period Genesis.The best track is the whole 22-minute ""Supper's Ready"", but there are other good moments, including Steve Hackett's quiet but moving ""Horizons"", a short guitar piece. Unfortunately, early Genesis was plagued by some really bad recording in the studio. The songs suffer from a muddy mix. Overall, this is a good example of early 70's progressive rock."
4,"It's not the best, but...","...since this is a Genesis album, we all know that anything Genesis does is excellent. Despite the fact that ""Watcher..."", ""Can-Utility..."", and ""Supper's Ready"" are classsics, I have a big problem with ""Time Table"" and ""Get 'Em Out..."". I think these are the most boring Gabriel-era Genesis songs (not including material from FGTR). Hence, only four stars. However, there really isn't a reason to avoid this album."
3,On the cusp,"3 1/2Often considered the best of early Genesis, there still clearly sounds like a thematic and compositional evolution was right around the corner, leaving Foxtrot an often brilliant but splintered springboard unto sheer perfection."
4,A classic album...but,"I am a Genesis fan, Gabriel era fan since thirty years, of course this album is a must have and a classic of prog music, but like I said in my review of Nursery Cryme, this album also didn't passes the test of time.Oh sure, there is Supper's Ready and Watcher of the skies, but listen again to Time Table or Get 'em out by Friday and see how these cuts are not well constructed songs as Genesis uses to composed. I am rating it four stars mostly for Supper's Ready. Still a must have album, but I won't listen to it very often, it sounds too dated in my opinion."
2,hello!,"FOXTROT has never been one of my favorite GENESIS albums.Songwise, it pales in comparison to it's wonderful predecessorNURSERY CRYME(which is my favorite GENESIS album). The progress-ive songs here just aren't that exciting and the overall produc-tion is weak. They got a bit over confident on this. My favoritesong here is Steve Hackett's gorgeous acoustic guitar instrumen-tal "" HORIZONS"". Damn shame it's the shortest song here! I'm alsoquite fond of the LOVER'S LEAP section of SUPPER'S READY, whichis easily the most beautiful and melodic tune on the album. WIL-LOW FARM is quite funny, tho GABRIEL'S on stage presentation ofthis song is even better than the tune itself! I respect thisalbum more than I like it! The photos of PETER GABRIEL, with hisshaved forehead( an anti-Mohawk!) and PHIL COLLINS, who, dare Isay, looks quite handsome with his full head of hair, are almostworth buying the album for! The lyrics are neat! or swell!"
2,This was not worth it,"I am a Genesis fan and was dissapointed with the outcome of this CD. The tid-bits that you can listen to are good but that was the end of it. Like watching a trailer for a movie and that was all the good parts. This is boring and sonically mundane. There are far superior albums that these guys did...Lamb, Trespass, Wind, Trick."
4,Eccentric English rock at its best,"This was the album that marked the band's move from cult status to a much wider appreciation. But the lyrics are even more tangential and the imagery more oblique. In the 1980s, this album got more FM airplay than any other Genesis recording aoart from 'Selling England ...'."
5,The second best Genesis album (after Selling England...),"Except for ""Time Table"" this album is a classic all the way through. ""Can Utility And The Coastliners"", ""Watcher Of The Skies"", and the legendary ""Supper's Ready"" are spectacular examples of the visionary nature of 70's progressive rock."
4,Tremendous,"A couple of clunkers take this out of the 5 star realm, but ""Watcher Of The Skies,"" ""Get Em Out By Friday,"" and, of course, ""Supper's Ready."" make this an essential in any collection. ""Supper's Ready"" answers any Peter Gabriel v. Phil Collins debate definitively. Listen to Peter Gabriel's vocal here, then listen to Phil Collins nearly destroy the song on Seconds Out. ""Supper's Ready"" is that rarest of songs that cannot be compared to any other songs. It should go into a time capsule with the greatest music of the past 400 years."
2,Not my cup of tea at all,"Have had Genesis albums for years and loved them especially Selling England by the Pound, but this one does not do it for me. Perhaps you need to be in the right mind space?"
5,let this be your escape.....,"It has been twenty five odd years since this album first ""got me"". I am completely perplexed how a person can listen to the same album approximately 4,000 times and still find it entertaining, mesmerizing, delightful. My advice for the uninitiated: don't give up after one listen -this album has a depth and intricacy that cannot be appreciated after one listen -it is not about catchy hooks, or show off guitar solos -it is not verse-verse-chorus-verse then stuff it into 4 minutes so that the radio folks might play it. This is music that is unlike anything you have heard before. My advice...play it, find a part that you like...replay many times and don't be surprised when this masterpiece of an album takes hold!"
5,Awesome All Purpose Cart,"This cart is awesome.It's lightweight, compact and easy to open. It rolls well even with over-sized items."
2,Flimsy Solder Points,"I bought 2 of these for work, we carry computers around a university campus. One broke after less than 10 uses. The platform solder points broke off, so now there is no more platform. The other is still holding on to dear life, but its also about to go. Adjusting the straps is a nightmare, you are better cutting the strap off, and using your bungie cords. We were pretty careful with these units, only used a few times, pretty dissappointed in how little they lasted."
5,Good item!,"This was purchased for my 83-yr-old mother who was traveling alone to Maine. She loved the ease of the product; she could handle pulling it, strapping her luggage down, etc. It rolled easily & it's well made. I am 5'8 (w/ back problems) and I could pull this cart without pain."
2,Great for people under 5 ft 9 inches MAYBE,"This appears to be reasonable for someone shorter than me (a not so very tall 6 foot 1 inch). As it is, it is just too short to be comfortable to use. If I stand such that the handle is meeting more than the last joint of my fingers, the cart is standing almost upright and is prone to fishtailing and jerking along in this configuration. I was surprised to see that there was not another sliding element to provide adjustable length.I would have been satisfied (I think) with its construction, but this limiting design doesn't permit me to use it. It would frankly be just as easy to carry parcels up to 25 pounds rather than subject myself to the knuckle-dragging gait that would be required for me to drag them in this cart."
5,8 Year of YES! This is/was a good luggage Cart,"I travel extensively and put a lot of load on the cart, often more than 100lbs. The cart shown in the photo has held up for 8 years. That should say it all. Eight year for $19.95 can beat that. Excellent. POST NOTE... the new cart that Amazon will send you will not be the cart pictured (which is the one I purchased 8 years ago). The new cart is gray (not black) and has a strap that is rigid cord not the bungee that works the best. The SPARCO Compact Luggage Cart is what the old Samsonite use to be. Though it probably would hold up I decided to send it back and purchased the SPARCO."
5,Great resource for teaching canons/rounds,This book is an excellent resource for choir teachers and general music as well. The canons in this collection are very musically catchy and wonderful to sing. They are rich in harmonies and just a great resource.
1,Not OK,For the price; not worth it. The product is great accept that I can't find replacement bulbs for it so it makes it a one time use and thats not worth it.
2,Can't find replacement bulbs,"I purchased this for my orchids. The bulbs have burned out and for the past 7 or 8 months I have been trying to find replacements. They are specially made by the company for the box, so I can't purchase regular grow lights to put in the unit. The PlantNanny website has been stating since January that they will have replacement bulbs in by April. It is now July. I moved my orchids outside for the summer, but don't think I will be abe to use this box for them this fall and winter. Frustrating for the amount of money I spent on the product."
3,"A good read, but not a great book","I enjoyed the book, and I'll probably keep my eye out for more books by this author. The background was well enough researched that I never was pulled out of the story, the main characters were interesting. I particularly liked reading a historical novel were the people were not historical characters, but lived about in the middle of what was possible economically in that time. I also liked the mystery and how Bek went about solving it."
4,It's simply fun!!,"This Top Notch vocal group puts their ""spin"" on some classic R & B recordings. They are great at taking something already wonderful and making it even better!!To make it even MORE fun they work really well with the guest artists! I think this was probably one of the, if not THE last recording that Laura Nyro made before she passed away. It's a great rendition of La-La Means I Love You.Chaka Kahn and Janis Siegel really belt out a great version of ""Hot Fun in the Summertime"". As strong a presence as Chakka is... Janis Siegel holds her own with no problem!!Speaking of summertime, I LOVE to listen to this CD while riding with windows all the way down on the way to the beach!!You'll like this CD!"
3,I had to let this one grow on me,"At first, I didn't like this album. Where was the Manhattan Transfer? With the exception of the last piece, all they were doing was singing backup to a bunch of other folks. What a letdown.Once I got over my disappointment at hearing too little of the Manhattan transfer and started to listen to the album on its merits, it grew on me. For one thing, the musicianship is very fine. The instrumentalists are first class, the arrangements are well done, and of course the Manhattan Transfer are beyond compare. I don't know what the guest artists sound like on their own records, but on this one they sing, and for the most part, quite well.The choice of numbers is good. They remind me that there were plenty of tuneful songs around in the 60s during the time of Soul and Motown. They sure beat the viciousness of rap!The album is a lot different from most Manhattan Transfer work, but it has considerable merit."
3,Harmonious,"I love ""The Thrill is Gone"". However, the album seems disconnected. Still, for the money it was well worth it for that one cut."
5,Great!,A complete change from the usual Manhattan Transfer but it is really great! I would recommend it if you like all the good old classic numbers.
3,"Excellent songs, Fair performances","This CD contains some of the best pop songs ever written with superb guest talent, but the actual performances are somewhat lackluster, with one exception, Laura Nyro's ""La la means I love you"" which will take you straight to heaven."
2,Guess What?,"Through my own fault, I didn't check out some of this album on You Tube. I had really liked some of this group's earlier work, but when this arrived I was thoroughly disappointed. When I sent it in for one of Amazon's fantastic returns (the best of ANY business!), they replied ""you've been such a loyal customer that we'll give you the refund and you can keep the item!"" So I gave it to a friend, which made him happy, made me happy. Amazon totally rocks! And I have no personal nor stock interest in them! Doing business with any other online source makes absolutely no sense so long as Amazon matches or beats their prices. Which nearly always is the case."
2,Why is this so fragile??,"I give two stars out of kindness. The cleaner does clean well, however, minutes after opening it and taking it out of the box, the plastic on the lid cracked. I've used it possibly 10 times now and every time the crack on the lid webbed out more and more. Today, on the 11th use, the lid broke off completely. Now, before accuse me of manhandling the machine in order to break it, you should know that I store it under the sink and gently lift it out from under the sink with each use (realizing how fragile it was with the first use). So now it's completely unusable."
4,mrsgong,"I like my jewelry cleaner. It is worth the money I paid for it as my jewelry looks much better today than it did before Christmas. Also, it is an unusual, but practical gift."
3,Real collectors care!,"To respond to the last review, since the artwork is unavaiable in any other format, to have it damaged in this way is negligent, to say the least. I received mine in the same bent condition (with dented bubble), and even though I open my figures as well, it's always nice to have the cardback to display... that is, whenever it's in any condition to be displayed at all.DISAPPOINTED."
1,Why take orders that can't be filled???,"I have heard many complaints as to the condition of packing of the Atar Wars Unleashed figures. All that I have to say is ""At least you got yours"". My order was placed back in April and I have heard no word as to whether I will be getting one or not. My best friend was notified that Amazon would not be filling his order for these which leaves me to ask..""Why take orders that cannot be filled?"" It's like overbooking an airline flight. There are X amount of seats (or in this case figures), yet orders are still taken and many people end up getting screwed by believing that they will be receiving their items long after the opportunity has passed to buy from someone else. Now, I've heard people say""Blame Hasbro"", but it is up tp Amazon to contact it's customers in regards to product delays and other issues, so I say "" Shame on you Amazon ""."
1,Don't buy from Amazon,Amazon has hands down the worst shipping department ever. I order several unleashed figures and they squashed them into a large box. I mean the box could have easily fit all the items but for some crazy reason they decide to bend the cardbacks so they all fit in a certain direction. They also screwed me and several other customers by not filling orders that got placed three months in advance!!
2,Vader Unleashed,"Okay so the package was bent a little around the edges because it is packed to tightly. The product was just fine though. If you are going to freakout if any of your Star Wars collection pieces are not mint condition, then move along. If you just have to have every Darth Vader. I would say it's a good buy for just a little cash. I've wasted $20 on much worse things then a cool Darth Vader. I say go for it, and may the force be with you."
1,Stew-Ped,Is it just me or is this one of the worst renderings of Darth Vader of all time. He looks completely out of character (kind of like Batman or something).
3,Potentially great,"I have only had a borrowed copy for a few days, but this could be the biggest break through since the PC.Everyone who models ODEs & PDEs with finite differencesshould have this book.Well written, but the math is dense."
3,Sweet but flawed,"I would not recommend this book to a single parent whose child is blissfully unaware of the differences between their family and other people's families. I would not recommend this book to a single parent who made the choice to be a single parent before becoming pregnant/adopting. However, I do believe that it is a useful book for parents who are in neither of those situations. I can't say that I'm a fan of just how forward the author is about all of the potential complications of being a single parent but they are honest and put in simple terms that are easy to build on if necessary during conversation. I definitely think that it requires outside conversation as well as some sort of clear intention on the parent's part about what they want to emphasize because the language is neutral enough that it could take a negative tone just as easily as a positive one, if not more so given the content."
1,Looking for help in the wilderness,I needed to build a small deck on my lake villa deep in the Ozark Hills. While in the woods I turned to my newly purchased Kindle and found the perfect answer...buy a book that tells me step by step how to accomplish my goal. Sadly this book did not. It did tell me how to select the right contractor and how to deal with city codes. Not the book I needed or wanted and the sample did not help.
4,gun shy-really good !!,"This cd is really good.It's a little raw,but is catchy.If this band hadsigned w/a major lable thier sound would have been more polished.For anIndie it has potential.Their song writing is well done.These guys couldhave made it big.They remind me of tesla,somewhat and skidrow-it's thatsame vein.Definately worth getting if your a fan of hard rock.It'sbetter than what's on the radio-if you ask me."
4,This was a three album set (too much of a good thing),"Back when everyone was making these gigantic three album LIVE sets , YES had to do one too! (I guess) I saw them three times during the period that this album was recorded and I loved them LIVE - but Yessongs doesn't hold up well for me all these years later (nor the movie of the same name). However there ARE some standouts.........""Starship Trooper"" I feel that this is the definitive version. ""And you and I"" ""Heart of the Sunrise"" ""Seen all good People"" ""Yours is no Disgrace"" all good stuff, good stuff really! Just more that I can handle. I can listen to all of ""Tales"" no problem, but this one gets old pretty fast. If you love YES and dont have it then I suppose you'll have to get it (like I did)."
4,Bessongs,"All the Best songs at the time for Yes live in 1973. Performances are high with energy and in some cases like ""Close to The Edge"" and ""Perpetual Change w/ Bill's drum solo"" they are better than the studio versions. I would have liked to hear more of the ""then"" recently departed for King Crimson Bill Bruford, he only is on 2 songs here, the rest is the new drummer at the time Alan White."
2,YES - LIVE,"Okay - I've never been a fan of live recordings. Seeing a band perform live can be Earth-shattering, listening to a live recording is only noisy. I didn't do my research and didn't realize this was all live, or I would have never bought it. I love the clean precision of Yes studio recordings, I don't want to hear cheers and whistles in the background."
5,Steve in Stillwater,"First heard this LP in 75 when a friend who was covertly teaching me how to drive popped it into his 8 track. The sound stunk, but the music soared. Wore the grooves off two editions of my own and am now wearing the lasers off my cd. This cd is in my opinion the best live album ever (with possible exception to Allman's Live at Fillmore). Still brings chills. Still proves that quality musicianship can stand the test of time regardless of vogue or fad. Hope to be buried with this cd."
5,Great Live Collection,"A fine selection of songs from their most creative period. Could almost be consdered a ""greatest hits"" album. Remastering makes this album sound as it did in the early 70's. Also, this contains fine Roger Dean artwork."
4,Massive live set captures Yes at their peak.,"Yes music was difficult enough to capture in the studio, let alone live in concert. Yessongs, a massive 3-disc live document recorded in '73, may be a bit much for the average listener, but is a banquet of goodies for the Yes fanatic. Constrained by the limited pre-digital recording and instrumental technology of that era, Yessongs must be heard in the context of its time. The band makes a valiant attempt to pull off their stunning, complicated music on stage - with crackling high energy and loose arrangements that leave plenty of room for improvising. Yes were truly at their peak here, during a very special era when music such as this could reach a massive audience - an era, sadly, that is gone forever. (Also highly recommended is the DVD video version of the Yessongs film.)"
1,No,"Giving one star for some vague remembrance of the remarkable original studio recordings of these tracks, which still raise a hair or two for a few seconds when heard on this album, especially ""Close to the Edge"", and why I thought this album sounded so good on vinyl 30 years ago, which it probably did.Leaves me to the conclusion of a horrible job of remastering, which makes this album barely inaudible at times. It sounds like it was remastered in a dank basement filled with old aluminum pots. Absolutely no depth, bottom or dimension to the music.Your equalizer won't help you here. I took it out of my player twice....just couldn't get through it. It actually hurt.Excuse me, I need to go back to studying the return policy for opened recorded music."
3,Still Amazing - But Dated,"An amazing recording, definitely worth resurrecting and spinning on the turntable again - sorry the CD player (Personal Digital Audio player?)!just sit down with your headphones on and a good book, slumped down ""in the chair that really fits you"" and drift.If popular music can be compared to evolution, with unexpected mutations here and there, providing some musical styles with an advantage over others by fulfilling a need that maybe the artist did not even realize was there, then Yes represents an evolutionary dead-end in Rock history. Rock-and-roll since 1972 definitely did NOT go the way of Yes' overblown, operatic, occasionally self-concious Art-rock interpretation. Nevertheless, it is beautiful to observe, preserved in time like some Neanderthal skeleton."
3,Great music but horrible sound,"The choice of music is perfect (one is missing, which is ""South side of the sky) This is the perfect live hightlight of the three previous CD(Album-Fragile-Close to the edge) but the sound is horrible.You should consider Keys to Ascension Vol I and II for great performance and sound, instead of this one. Music is five star but sound is one single star, hence the mid section rating of three stars."
2,Great Album-Poor CD,"Man,What a disapointment! Some of the most incredilbly rich music ever recorded live given the ""remaster"" label and being just about the worst cd I've ever heard. One listen was all I could muster. The music it'self is stellar but it's like looking at a Van Gogh through a veil.As the Grateful Dead are proving you can take master tapes from the 1970's and clean them up to cd standards. Who ever was in charge of this needs to be held accountable and this is one cd that deserves a great effort to clean up.Do yourself a favor and look for an old LP. Sounds WAY better on vinyl!My .02,W"
2,"""A two you say""",Yes a 2 not because I am not a fan of Yes but because the digital remastering is HORRID. If people are praising the sound on this because it's better than the vinyl then the vinyl must have been unlistenable. This is all top end and it seems every instrument is trying to compete at being higher on the scale than Jon's own voice. Nerve racking to say the least. IMHO this is not worth keeping in my changer while I have all the studio remasters which are all keepers.
3,So so,"Really looked forward to getting this for my husband, but had to send it back because of the sound quality. The seller was very nice and the return went very well. Maybe I got a bad one as it happens sometimes. No negative feed back for seller just the one order."
1,From bad to worse,I wrote a negative review on 8/25/11 after getting this bag which did not have the normal strap on the back for shaking out clippings. Humboldt replied the same day that they would send me a bag WITH the necessary strap. That was two weeks ago and nothing from them. Stay away from these people. I would return the bag but I'm afraid I won't get my money back according to my experince so far. There are plenty of other suppliers who have to be more professional and honest. From now on this company will be called the Bah Humbug Sometimes Manufacturing gang.
4,Great Book,This is a great current reference book! The information is presented in a logical easy to read style. Good for beginning and advanced students.
4,A good book for microbial genetics,"While many books in molecular biology explore about the eukaryotic cells, this book is designed for prokaryotic aspects. Most of the topics are about the E.coli the bacteria that we now know much about. However, some of the topics are somewhat complicated and misleading for an undergradaute student who still needs some backgrounds in bacterial genetics (A good example is where the authors draw the picture of the interaction between lac O1, O2 and O3 in the lac operon and that's wrong!)...The questions at the end of each chapters are nice and well prepared but a few of the answers given at the end of the book do not explain the point well enough. Overall, this is a good book for anyone who wants to know specifically in the field."
3,Not a good choice for the visual learner,"If you are a ""visual learner,"" then this is NOT, I repeat, NOT, the book for you- I cannot emphasise this enough!The text is very well written, however, the font used is rather small, and there are only FOUR colors used throughout the entire book.The text is done entirely in light brown, black, grey and white.Students like me -strongly visual learners- will be miserable; everyone else will like the book."
2,where's the money about the first order I made.,"I ordered twice of this book, because the first order was delivered, and the money was not refund to my account even now!!the second one is good, they delivered another one for me.but I am really curious about, where's my money for the first one I ordered?!!,will you hurry up to refund my money back?!! it has already one momth past"
4,Nice car kit!,Car kit works really well. I had the advantage of having a 6160 car kit installed so all I did was replace the phone holder and plug in the mic that I already had installed with the old kit.4 not 5 stars because phone holder doesn't have the 'rock solid' feel of the 6160 kit
3,Just OK,"spend more and get better...these are better than capers in brine, but about the poorest of salted capers I've had...and that's at least a dozen brands"
5,Complete textbook,"""Speaking Korean"" consists of 4 volumes which lead you to master the Korean launguage. I tried many other textbooks but I found this volumes most helpful. Repeated drills is the best way you can learn a language. This book is also helpful to understna Korean culture and customs at the same time. It is not for young children but college students and up. When you finish vol.4 you can read Korean newspapers and their editorials. You will also be able to discuss political matters in Korean. Recommended only for serious students."
3,good for self study,This book is fine for self study or review material that you having trouble with in a real classroom situation. The layout is very simple and a little boring relying on antiquated teaching methodology. This works fine at home but not in a group or classroom situation.
2,There are better books available,"The ""Speaking Korean"" series has a good first book. However the second book is lacking. This particular volume in the series is filled with completely useless vocabulary, and also contains grammer that is very rarely used. The book is ten years old and needs to be revised. Also, the english explanations are poorly written, and the examples in this particular book are somewhat lacking. This may have been the best book available 10 years ago. But the Korean Language changes very quickly, and some parts of the book are not often used anymore. I give ""Speaking Korean Volume 2"" 2 stars because of the reasons I already stated and due to the availability of other, better texts."
1,It fit the purpose of a one time use tie,"It didn't meet my expectations.....It was flimsy and wrinkled, and looked messy."
4,You get what you pay for,"This tie was bought for my daughter to wear to high school as part of a modified uniform (white blouse, black skirt or pants with red accessories). We received the order very quickly and she was delighted. It may not be the type of tie a business executive would wear, however to wear as a holiday tie, or for a teen, it is an excellent value. Despite the comment about it being flimsy and looking messy, it is holding up well to being worn once or twice per week by a student who often jams it into her athletic bag."
2,"Gorgeous color, but poor quality.","The tie does have gorgeous color to it, but when the description says ""good quality"" its a little off base."
4,Deep Color!!,Great pop of color and nice feel to touch. I bought it as a Christmas gift. I know it will look great on!!
5,Great Tie - for the money!,"I needed 17 red ties in 3 days and Tieguys delivered. The ties are a gorgeous shade of red and are perfect for the launch of our new firm, Red Chair Architects!"
2,They leave streaks!,"I think my dashboard looks worse after using these wipes than it did before. They always leave streaks and I have to go over it with a wet rag just to make it look presentable. I wanted to keep these in my car as a quick cleaning tool, but they never get the job done."
2,Insufficient liquid-dries out.,"There's not enough liquid in the container, which leads to insufficient dampness of the wipes. They also dry out easy. I get the impression they're trying to cut corners or something? C'mon, fill er up man!"
1,removes finish,My husband used these on the center console of his Hyundai Sante Fe and it removed the color. Now there is a huge brown spot in the gray finish. Use with caution and test an inconspicuous area first!
1,streaky,"all of the car armor all wipes (cleaning, protectant finish, and leather) leave my cars interior streaky and so horrible looking!!!! I use them and then wipe with a towel and it still is streaky.. I am not happy at all and will never buy an armor all product again.. HORRIBLE."
2,Not Her Best,"I've read five of Chamberlain's books that sealed the deal for me being a fan (Secret Lives, Summer's Child, The Courage Tree, Cypress Point and especially Breaking the Silence). Private Relations missed her mark and is sub-par of her skill. I'll skip the story line - Amazon supplies that - and recommend Diane Chamberlain as an author, but only die-hard, going-to-read-all-of-her-books fans should spend their time on this novel. Don't judge her by this one."
2,Did not read book,"I don't know how this book got on my shelf, but it did not interest me to continue reading after the first chapter. It is a 'saga'. It doesn't seem like a 'bad' book, just not one I am interested in.Back Cover:They agreed to share their lives...but what about their hearts?To Kit Sheridan, Chapel House is a haven. A Jersey Shore mansion overlooking the ocean, it is inhabitied by a group of close friends and seems the perfect spot to recover from her divorce.When Cole Perelle, a young doctor, arrives at the beach house, he and Kit immediately strike up a special, close friendship.It is a friendship so valuable that neither is willing to risk it by acting on the intense attraction that develops between them. Their intertwined lives begin to echo the rhythms of the waves on the beach as they come together, pull away and come together again. But like a forceful wave, Kit and Cole's passions inevitably crash, forcing them to choose between certainty and doubt...between love and all else."
5,GREAT MIC,What can i say about the mic???....Neumann TML 103...GREAT mic at a GREAT price..Every single site has nothing but positive reviews about this one so i9 decided to buy it right away
4,poirot--hercule poirot,"THE BIG FOUR would seem to be a response to the James Bond craze of the 60s, where every hero had to be a spy and every villain had to be trying to rule the world. How odd to know that this book preceded James Bond by about 30 years! No, the plot is not credible, but who cares? Poirot and Hastings get to save the world! And we meet Hercule's identical twin brother, Achille! Don't be too critical. Just read this book and enjoy."
5,THE BEST BOX SET EVER,short and sweet--this box set is the best piece of music that has ever come out. the history of music should start w/ this box set.
5,If you LOVE Stevie Wonder this is the one for you!!!,"This CD box set is definitely worth the money!! My 2-year old godson loves it as well!! He runs to get his ""mike"" and groove to the funky sounds of Mr. Wonder... He even turns up the volume and gets me up to dance with him. It's gonna be a great asset at the family reunion this year with everyone humming, singing along, dancing and reminiscing as I have been since the day I received it in the mail. I'm gonna end this as I began it.... Definitely worth the money!!!!"
5,TOTALLY WODER-FULL,"The ultimate collection of Stevie Wonder's work. Every song brings back memories and stays strong for today's market. If you have to own one of Stevie Wonder's CDs, this is the one to get."
5,Fully Loaded,"This is one masterpiece of a box set. Seventy songs that leave you crying for more. The first disc is a comprehensive summary of the early years. Stevie really adds some special touches to Dylan's Blowin' In The Wind and the Beatles We Can Work It Out. Discs two and three are just full of prime time material. My gosh almsot the entire Innervisions record is on here. I Believe really stands out here with its softer and spunkier attributes. The Songs In The Key Of Life tracks are a great pleasure as well. Then there's the lovely regaae flavored Jammin'. The fourth disc does drop off a bit and I am a little dissappointed that only one track from the badly underrated Conversation Peace CD was Included. However, there is too much good material for this to be worthy of anything less than five stars."
5,The ultimate Stevie Wonder Collection,"When I first heard of this set coming out fall of last year, I knew I had to have it. I have most of Stevie's recording since he's been doing his own producing and has found some of his earlier works on CD. This collection's sound quality is better than the attempts that have been made by Motown to put his analogue recordings on CD in the past. This is the type of collection that you could put on and just let it play! All the favorite song that true Stevie Wonder Fans enjoyed and cherished are on this collection. The only problem I had was that the song ""Ribbon in the Sky"" was flawed at least on the two different Box Set, one that I purchased and the other that was a replacement."
2,It's Not Enough,"There are already compilations with the Top40 stuff on them, and they don't cost an insane amount of money. Besides, any Stevie Wonder comprehensive box set that doesn't have ""Ribbon In the Sky"" on it is worthless. Instead, save money and buy the so-called ""Definitive Collection"". Ribbon isn't on it, either, but you'll have the most popular songs on it and pay a whole lot less money."
5,the visionary,of course this set gets the highest number.cuz this is one of the greatest artist ever.his 70's records alone are greatest hits and must haves.i would however like to have something from his vaults though.cuz it's long overdue.the man has tons of great unreleased songs.but you can never say enough of his genius&impact on music and the world over.his work is timeless.there will never be another stevie wonder.he is truly one of a kind.
4,it's great but...,"I just got this for my birthday. I seems like a great idea, for those that want an easier way to get into Stevie, but for those that are serious you really need to buy the individual albums. The songs by them selves are amazing, no one can deny, but when placed in the correct spot on their respective albums they just pack so much more. It's exponential!"
2,....Ehh...,...Thats not the original announcer intro to fingertips..what else did they change..I'll pass...Buyer beware..CD producers for the most part always get the big picture wrong..They don't get it.!
3,Don't get me wrong...,"Please don't get me wrong, Stevie Wonder is the greatest musical genius ever known, in my eyes. I gave this a rather low rating for the sole reason that not even 4 CD's can completely capture the man's accomplishments in his life. Rather than this, I strongly reccomend buying his single albums, instead of this ""greatest hits"" compilation. I strongly reccomend buying Greatest Hits Volume 1, Greatest Hits Volume 2, Music Of My Mind, Talking Book, Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale, Songs In The Key Of Life, Hotter Than July, In Square Circle, and Characters. All of these albums are masterpieces and every song on every album is equally genius in its own way. Although it is much more costly to spend money on all of these albums, it is WELL worth the price, believe me. Thank You for your attention.Sweets, Je' taime"
1,"Click, click with every step or mesh, mesh sounds like walking on","I hated to walk anymore even inside the house while wearing those NOISY shoes. Everybody will know when you're coming or going. I swear, these shoes are first, in my count, to make so much noise. I will not dare to wear those shoes in public place, or private for that matter. They really make too much noise, I had to return them. They look great, but I can't get the noise out of my head!"
2,She's done a lot better...,"I have to say this book really disappointed me. While some good romantic situations were set up, I found the dialogue to be unrealistic, the whole book too predictable, the loving sessions nearly carbon copies of one another and the ending to be in complete soap opera fashion. I've read a lot of romance novels and have been a fan of Connie Mason for 10+ years (especially the ""Bold Land, Bold Love"" series), but I found this book to be too formulaic, predictable and contrived. She's done better."
4,great house-but not the house that jack built!,"This house is great! we got it as a christmas gift for my 19m daughter. She absolutely loved it! It was the only gift she ""opened"" on Christmas day. She woke up the next night at 3 am bleary-eyed- asking ""playhouse?"" she was so excited about it.The only problem is that assembly is not as easy as it says. It is not a ""click"" together house. You need an electric screwdriver to go into the plastic as there are no pre-drilled holes. My family played poker on christmas eve with the first two people out having to assemble the house... luckily I didn't lose! But boy was my sis mad!!! It took her all night (plus some help!) since she didn't know how to use the electric drill. But once she got it up- it has been great. The only catch is- we are going to have to take it apart to get it outside in the spring. oh well! It's still a lot of fun for her!"
1,"Junk, you get what you pay for!","We bought this playhouse for our two boys and immediately returned it. The quality and durability of the plastic is just awful. It is very cheap. My son leaned up against the counter inside and the outside of the wall caved in. Needless to say, my husband disassembled this and we took it back. We spent an extra $100 and bought the Little Tikes ImagineSounds Playhouse. It is 100% better and my son just loves it. The quality is so much better, and it is a much larger playhouse and the boys will be able to fit inside much longer than they would have with this one. Just remember this: If the price is cheap, the product probably is too!"
1,Neat & Tidy cottage and Amazon,"Totally dissatisfied with Amazon. This birthday gift order was never received, apparently lost in the mail. Amazon failed to replace it leaving me to find another supplier at a higher cost, and ignoring my customer service complaint. Amazon has lost me as a customer."
4,My daughter LOVES this cottage!!!,"I got this cottage for my 14 month old daughter and she LOVES it. We keep it in the house and our daughter is in it every chance she gets. She likes to sit on the pre-made chairs and eats snacks on the little table, she also loves to talk on the included telephone which is too cute!!! For the price, this house is a great buy and she will be able to use if for a few more years.I was a little nervous about buying something so large on-line because I was afraid it would arrive broken but it arrived fast and in perfect condition and the free shipping from Amazon is such a great deal!!!The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the flooring inside has deep grooves and if your little one is bare footed and playing in it for long periods, it can be painful on the feet. I resolved this issue by going to the home store and buying a small grey bathroom rug to match and pad the flooring. Now its more than perfect and we LOVE it!!!"
5,Playing house!!!,"Bought this for my 21 month old and it has been a HUGE hit!She loves going in and out, rings the doorbell, opens the window , checks if she has phone calls and the other day she sat inside and had a snack on the table.I have this indoors and it faces the living room and the kitchen which suits her fine as she watches everyone in the house from the comfort of her own little place."
