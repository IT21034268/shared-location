5,riders,"What a great read could not stop reading. Jilly Cooper is an unreal story line writer.When you start this book you are immediatly caught up in the lives of all the characters in the book,you nerver want the ride or story to end."
5,Favorite,"This is my favorite Jilly Cooper book. It is typical Jilly Cooper style. The book is long and the characters are well developed, entertaining and a bit over the top but it is one I continute to reread."
4,Interesting,"This is an interesting book with a focus on texture and tailoring not colour, which is in keeping with the title. I have found it especially interesting in that several of the patterns were technically quite innovative, which is something that I rarely find in most commercial knitting books. It is rare to have a pattern which is novel for its knitting technique rather than its colour use. In particular, there is a pattern to produce a fully reversible jacket that is differently coloured on each side.This is not a flawless book, I don't like all the patterns but the majority are more than good enough to repay my investment in the book. The instructions are clear, concise and blessedly error free and it is nice to have a new knitting book that is not just another book of full of intarsia patterns."
4,Different! Not your usual knitting book,"Every knitting designer focuses on different techniques and style. Sasha Kagan and Kaffe Fassett are known for color work, Alice Starmore for Aran and Fairisle inspired design with an Scottish flair. Jean Moss' book is very interesting, in that it concentrates on texture and form, rather than color.It is unusual to find knitting books with tailored, sculpted patterns. So this book stands out in that it has patterns that are a departure from the huge, shapeless bulkies of today's haute couture, or the classic jumpers that are featured in many other books. If you love shape and texture in knitting, you will not be disappointed.The best thing about this book is the use of Colinette yarns in some of the designs. These designer yarns are gorgeous, handpainted, textured, and matched for working together. It isn't always easy to visualize how to use them, and it's wonderful to have some patterns to show them at their best."
5,Challenging but beautiful,"I am an experienced knitter but haven't done anything in the past years - on one hand because I am too busy - on the other hand because I was searching for something challenging that also looked nice when finished. Well, I search no more. This book gives me all that I need: challenge, beautiful designs and a pretty result that I can wear, give away or have in my home and enjoy. You will not find the usual bulky sweater in this book and the designs are thought through and very artful. I am sure, I will keep knitting things from this book for the next few months and I will keep this book as a very special knitting design book. I have not seen such designs anywhere else yet and would love to see a sequence of sculptured knits soon."
5,Best ever!,"I finally have a knit-design book that is worth every penny! Miss Moss has exquisite taste and style. The designs are special in an extraordinarily subtle way with rich textures and very flattering lines. (The closer you get, the better they look.)What a treasure!"
4,the height of thoreau-vean reading!,"J. P. Huber's book is the most interesting of all those published in this new series by Houghton Mifflin. The reason for this is that he mixes Thoreau quotes with a detailed, almost pitch by pitch, description of the early ascents of many New England Mts. This book should be a must-read by all interested in mountains, mountain climbing, and environmental scholarship in general. For the latter reason, the publisher, Green Frigate Books, asked Huber to pen an intro blurb to my recently published book ""Profitably Soaked: Thoreau's Engagment with Water."""
1,This is not the screw-on model,"I ordered this hose (which took over a week to arrive) and it's the wrong hose. I need a screw-on model, and this is not it! Be sure you check what kind of connection you need between the hose and the vac.I am giving one star for the 10% restocking fee on returns, which was not clearly listed anywhere."
1,Bad news,"I bought a new Mitsuba camcorder for my daughter for Christmas. It worked only 2 weeks. I bought it from E-Bay, and cannot contact the seller. The LED light won't even come on. I would advise shopping around."
4,Great read,"This is a good book. It sets the stage well, building characters enabling you to understand how difficult the struggle to overcome life's hardships. A good strong female character that was able to become once again who she had temporarily lost in her life's darkest moments.With the leading male strong and confident enough to encourage, the one he loves, to be just as strong and confident as he himself is without feeling less of a man.A book to ponder how strong all of us can really be under any circumstances in our own lives."
4,Intriguing story,"Loved the story line, good read. But hey it's Catherine Coulter! I knew I wouldn't be let down. Will be reading the rst of the trilogy."
2,If you have ever been abused... careful,First i want to say I LOVE Catherine Coulter... She is a great writer... but this book was very disturbing to me... so graphic regarding the sexual abuse. What was nice was she meets a man whom is very gentle and understanding of her. And shows her that all men are not like her first husband. Maybe I am thin skinned.... but this book was very hard emotionaly for me to read.
4,"A usual Coulter ""good read""",This was a good book which is usual for Coulter. She keeps you wanting to hurry and turn the page and then wish the end was not there.
4,Night Fire,"I am enthralled with this book! I sincerely had a very difficult time putting it down. I read the entire Night Trilogy and thoroughly enjoyed each book. The Trilogy has everything you look for in Catherine Coulter's books. Her imaginative expertise does not disappoint you here. For those of you who have never experienced Ms. Coulter's books, you've got to read the Night Trilogy. Also read her other books to experience a broader spectrum of her writing. Ms. Coulter is a diverse writer and I promise she won't disappoint you."
3,On the right track but misses a beat....,I have read almost all of Catherine Coulter's books and find this to be one of the most lacking. The small meeting between Arielle and Burke... well it is difficult to imagine it leading to such an obsession on Burke's part. Also Coulter should have allowed Arielle some regression to at least get in touch with her counter feelings for Burke because I felt up until page 150 or so... well I felt Arielle really did want NOTHING to do with Burke. Hmm... I read it through but I had to force myself. I appreciate the reality of the situation but I think Jane Feather did a much better novel similar to this in The Diamond Slipper (I think that is the correct title). I will continue to read and admire her novels but this is by far my least favorite series.
5,Night Fire,"This is one of the very first romance novels I ever read. A friend of mine stole it from her mom and lent it to me in Eighth grade. Years later, my best friend and I were discussing our favorite romance novels, and this one came up. It took me 3 weeks to find it, but now that I have, I'm thrilled that it's back in my collection! This is the book that made me want to read more romance novels. I love the characters and the story, as it is very different than any book I have ever read. Arielle's character is very touching and you want her to be strong and get over her fears. Burke is one of the best male characters around. He's not rude or mean or in any way a jerk. I recommend this book for any historical romance fan!"
4,Night Fire....a fantastic read!,"In ""Night Fire"", you find a touching and intense love story between Arielle Leslie, and the man she had an interest in as a teen, Burke Drummond. You will ride along with them as they conquer Arielle's troubled, and painful, past marriage. You can get involved in the Drummond family, and come to love them as I did. It is a great example of how abuse was dealt with in the past, and a better example of how to deal with it after the fact. So, sit back and enjoy!"
1,Disappointment!,"I've always enjoyed reading Catherine Coulter so when I saw that she had a trilogy out I bought the first one and planned to settle down for a great read. Really, Ms Coulter? What a disappointment! This is nothing more than a cheezy, predictable romance. With that said, I think I'll skip the other two. My recommendation is to get a sample first."
5,Absolutely brilliant!,"It's a toss-up who is the best comic-book/graphic novel writer of all time, Grant Morrison or Alan Moore. With ""Crawling From The Wreckage"", Morrison began staking his claim as #1.It would be pointless to begin a plot dissection of this trade paperback, which collects the first four issues of Morrison's run on the Doom Patrol comic (issues #19-22). There is a frenetic, stream-of-consciousness quality to all of Morrison's work on DP, and he was just getting started at this point (his last issue was #63).Everyone, from casual fans to comic-book junkies, should own this collection. It's required reading from one of the living masters of the genre. Five stars!"
4,Postmodern comics,"Anyone who thought comics were just Batman, Superman and American Escapism should have a second look.Ironically, this IS a superhero book, but not one which you likely to have seen before. Grant Morrisonis a Scottish writer who has turned the genre on its head. It features characters like Crazy Jane, anabuse survivor with ninety-odd personalities, all with their own powers; Rebis a polysexual symphony andDorothy the Monkey Girl (who can externalise her subconscious). This is the start of Morrison's inventiverun on the series and highlights are Orqwith (a hyperreal city constructed by postmodern philosophers), RedJack (a man who may be god, jack the ripper or both) and the red-legged scissor-men. It has a fairy tale/fairy nightmare ambience."
1,"Interesting Concept, Flawed Execution","""Doom Patrol"" is the kind of graphic novel you'll either love or be completely mystified as to why others praise it so highly. After purchasing and reading the first three books based on rave Amazon.com reviews, I have to be one of the few to add my name to the later category. It's an admittedly clever idea with a lot of interesting concepts and artwork, yet it remains a surprisingly tedious and un-engaging read (a la ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Black Dossier""). I have absolutely no desire to read any more of the series and I cannot recommend it to anyone other than philosophy 101 or pseudo avant-garde art students. DP quickly collapses under it's own pretentious and surrealistic weight, skip it, and move on to the excellent ""Ex Machina"" or ""Y The Last Man"" or ""Invincible"" series for a true dose of current comic genius."
3,SCREWS BUT WON'T DRILL,"This tool seems to operate fine but don't try to use the drills that come with it because the Jacobs Chuck needed to hold the drill bits is not included in the reconditioned model according to a Milwaukee spokesman, even though the chuck is shown in the pictures as included in the kit.One could go buy a Jacobs Chuck or better yet, buy a set of drill bits with hex bases that will fit in the tool. This will set you back atleast $10."
5,Feeding your soul,This is a touching and beautiful recollection of lessons learned from her beloved grandfather. It speaks to lessons learned from her patients with terminal cancer. She takes to heart all these lessons as she realized just how patients really want to be treated by their doctor (MD). It is wonderfully written and Remen will touch your heart!
5,"Inspirational, but not heavy handed","This book is well written, easy to dip into, with many moving stories. It is wonderful to be able to read a few chapters when you need a spiritual lift and don't have the opportunity to sit and delve into a heavy tome."
4,My Grandfather's Blessing,"This is an incredible book. Dr. Remen's memories of her grandfather and his teachings, as well as her experiences as a healer-physician and counselor are breathtaking. This is a must read for those of you who wish to be connected to the inner source...one's soul."
3,Good book but not what expected,Very encouraging stories yet I prefer to see those positive stories tight to the hand of of the Lord.
5,A FANTASTIC book!,"This book just keeps getting better and better! The stories are great - it's a good book to keep next to your bed and read one or two stories before going to sleep.ANYONE who needs some rejuvenation - especially people in the medical or helping professions, NEEDS a copy of this book!"
5,Deeply rewarding read,I loved this book. A friend lent it to me and after reading several pages I knew it was a book I wanted to own and would read and reread over the years. It helps put things in perspective in one's own life.
5,Amazing Woman,"This is one of my all time favorite books, and Rachel Remen is one of my heroes. Her love and compassion shine through every page of this and her other book, Kitchen Table Wisdom. Each chapter is complete in itself, yet the flow of the book is smooth. Her work is like a river, wide and lovely and deep. I've waited for years for more, but haven't found any. Rachel works with people who are diagnosed with fatal illness. She is a detailed observer of the movement of the soul, and expresses her observations lyrically. I've given both books as gifts, I read and reread them. In times of high stress or anguish, these are books I return to."
5,What an inspiration!,"When you read upfront all the endorsements by inspirational professionals, you know something good is in store. Rachel Remen is special. I like a book where I can pick it up and put it down whenever I want and not lose the flavor and intent of the book.It's one I don't want to pass on, because I know I will read it again and again and even mark special pages that will help in challenging times. I will, however, recommend this book to my friends, especially those who I know are going through difficult times. When they read about the courage that others have had, I feel it will give them strength. I'm so happy I accidentally saw this book on the shelf where I read for the blind...Learning Ally."
2,came broken,The box was damaged resulting in the motor to be damaged. I had to take it to a technician to get it fixed before I could install it. Not too happy about it. Thought it was going to be a decent deal but ended up not so good. Never said scratch and dent in the description....
4,A fitting tribute.,"Kampfar's music, while aggressive, also expreses love for the natural beauty of Norway. Kampfar manages to fuse norwegian folk into thier music without relying on acoustics or other intruments, rather, they use folkish melodies and beats in thier songs to create a very seemless and natural fusion. The only problem this album has is that it's too short, it leaves you wanting more."
4,Eyes self titled CD,"Awesome CD if you can find this out of print CD. I actually had the original tape of this. I found the CD on ebay and paid $25 for it and it was worth it. Jeff Scott Soto has a great voice and the band has that classic 80's metal sound. There is a great hidden song at the end of the CD (Somebody to Love),which is a vocal insturmental and really shows how great Soto's voice is-along with the rest of the band harmonizing beautifully together on the chorus. This is one band that should have made it big along with Def Leppard, Motley Crue, Dokken, Ratt,etc, but they came out at the wrong time -1990, when Metal was killed by Nirvana and the rest of the alternative bands. If you like 80's metal and can find this CD, definetly buy it!"
3,I give it an 8 out of 10,"There are a lot of good bands who's music gets little or no play on the radio. To me Eyes is one of those bands. I was stunned when I found out that ""Don't Turn Around"" wasn't originally sung by ""Ace Of Base."" It wasn't originally sung by ""Eyes"" either but I still enjoyed their version of it. In fact I liked there version better than the Ace Of Base version. Other good songs off this album include ""Every Single Minute,"" ""Nobody Said It Was Easy,"" and ""Young And Innocent."" I didn't enjoy every song on this album but this is still a must have."
1,Camera Case does not fit 1400 as advertised,I just received the case after a wait of 4 weeks due to being out of stock. It does not fit the Fuji Finepix 1400 as described. The case won't close since the camera is too big for it.
1,THIS WATCH IS NO BARGAIN,"Despite its supposed retail price of about $200, this watch is not worth anything. It stopped running three days after I received it. I replaced the battery, even though there should have been no need to. Two days later, the watch stopped working again, and it hasn't worked since. One of these days I'll have it repaired, but only if it doesn't cost much. I've obviously already overpaid for a watch that doesn't work, even though it was sold for a very good price."
3,Flawed camerawork hurts all three ballets,The main problem I have with this dvd is that I don't get a sense of an actual stage performance. This comes off as a Hollywood movie set. The camera moves all over the stage to get unusual shots that are often too close. I don't need to get an ultra closeup shot of the huge fake eyelashes on Nina Ananiashvili. The camera work is perhaps worst of all in Scheherazad. This camera person apparently felt the need to enhance the effect of these classic works for the viewer. The costumes are very fine. The dancing seems fine (what can be seen of it). The sets are three dimensional so I wonder how authentic they are. The orchestra sounds surprisingly good compared to most ballet orchestras. Recorded sound and picture are excellent. This could have been so much better if not sabotaged by the camera work.
1,Error message,"Wouldn't play on two DVDs. Just provided error message. Did play a bit on my computer. What I saw was an ""over artistic"" version of Firebird, so highly elaborate as to interfere with the dancing. The good news - got a refund quickly!"
2,"Buyer Beware, Very Disappointed","We bought this three wheeler for our son who just turned 2 for Christmas. However, it took him until April to just get on and ride it (this due to the jolt you get from stepping on the gas it was kind of scary to him and to the neighbor boy who turned 2 last August). Once they got use to it then it was no problem EXCEPT this vehicle will turn over on your child if they turn it to fast or if they go to fast around a corner. For the same reason they took 3 wheelers off the market they should also take this one off too. I would not recommend this for your child unless they are over 3 1/2 and even then I would not recommend this to be their first vehicle."
2,Far fetched and contrived,This was a disappointing tale from a writer I long to love because of my southern roots. The story was unbelievable - the trauma suffered by the protagonist's daughter just didn't seem significant enough to warrant her almost wasting away from depression. Logic was missing throughout the book. I do enjoy Siddons' descriptions of uniquely southern landscapes and customs (therefore 2 stars) but her stereotyping of southern eccentrics is tiresome.
2,Dumb ending mars a pretty good book,"There aren't too many things I hate more than to get engrossed in what seems to be a pretty good book, only to have the author turn into a moron at the end and blow it. Such is the case with ""King's Oak"". The first 400 pages are pretty good, but the last 100 -- Yow! Should you decide to read this book, stop at the point where the water starts to glow and the baby goat dies. From that point on it's for idiots only."
3,Never Ending,"Siddons is one of my favorite authors, but I had to really push myself to finish this book. The descriptions of the woods seemed never ending, and there wasn't enough dialogue for my liking. I was so happy when the main characters would finally get out of the woods and go to a party or whatnot! I found Dabney and his ""forest friends"" with their crazy woodland rituals to be very strange, and Andy to be irritating most of the time. My disappointment in King's Oak will certainly not deter me from reading more of Siddons' books. I think she is an extraordinary writer. I absolutely loved Peachtree Road and Downtown, among others. Perhaps Siddons was just aiming for something totally different this time around. She's allowed. It just wasn't for me."
5,Riviting,"The characters were all complex and interesting, and the story was unusual and intriguing. There were elements of the ""otherworldly"" that were thought provoking. I kept needing to see what would happen, so I fell asleep several nights while reading it."
2,disapponting,I've loved her other books but was so disappointed with this one. It went on and on; too much redundant sex and back and forth relationship issues. It could have been so much deeper and richer if it hadn't been as repetitive with happenings. I felt sorry for Hillary with such a weak and shallow mother most of the time. It was boring. I did enjoy some of the characters while others left me totally bored. Sorry Anne - you can and have done so much better as an author.
1,A waste of time.,"The author's lengthy descriptions of EVERYTHING!! Every tree, every blade of grass, every change in the weather, every emotion felt by Andy, the feel of every fabric, on and on and on. So tedious!! After reading so many books by this author I was very disappointed in ""King's Oak"". No more Anne Rivers Siddons for me."
1,Not worth the time spent reading,"I was so terribly disappointed in this book. It was the only book of Siddons that I hadn't read and it was just plain wierd. The story of the characters went along just fine, until Andy became inthralled with Tom, and his way of life. I do not believe that this was a healthy lifestyle for her young daughter. But what do I know of the south."
1,Animal lovers beware,"Siddons tries hard to make us care about the spiritual, one-with-nature character of her wild mountain man Tom Dabney, but the truth is he's a sadistic and evil beast who ritually sacrifices healthy animals to appease some unknown force in the woods. I normally enjoy Siddons' books, but this one was a huge disappointment. Disgusting descriptions of hunting and cruelty to animals."
2,Awful ending ruins book,"I enjoyed the book until the ending (particularly the epilogue). The end so bad I doubt I will ever read another book by Siddons again. For Andy to return to the woods - to live non-the-less - is utterly unbelievable especially considering the extent of the contamination described by the author. By the end, the melodramatic drivel was making me ill (and that's coming from someone who loved ""Low Country""). It's certainly not worth the time it takes to read."
4,Concise and straight to the point,"This book is comprehensive. It covers a lot of topics about real estate investing. Furthermore, it offers tips and tricks on how successful investors were able to pull off their deals. Something that is hard to come by, as many real estate authors aren't really investors.Just a side note -- if you're an expert, you'd probably learn something from this, but overall you would be bored. So don't buy it thinking your going to get a ""for experts"" book, this is for beginners. Those that have not made their mark on the real estate market yet.-Mattco-author of the Ultimate Foreclosure Kit"
5,Solid Basic Information,"Eldred presents solid information on the topics he promises to discuss: how to find ways to pay for real estate, how to evaluate a good opportunity, not just by knowing your local market, but by doing the math, how to negotiate and write a good deal, and some basic tips toward ""landlording"". The writing is clear and to the point, not larded with ""fluff"" and stories. I borrow some books on the subject from the library. This one I own."
3,Good book,"It's a good book and an easy read. It was a little too general when covering material. The book makes other references to other books written by the author. However, for someone who wants or is thinking about going into Real Estate,it will tell you enough to help you make a decision and what other books to buy for more information."
4,The Beginner's Guide to Real Estate Investing by Gary W. Eldred,"An official Library Weekly book review.EXCERPT:You can manage rentals hassle free by...RATING:4 of 5REVIEW:This book highlights real estate investing withease. It summarizes quick techniques of appraisingthe value of an investment property, how to negotiateyour purchase offer, and how to manage properties withoutmajor problems. The foreclosure segment does need someelaboration, specifically on tax liens and tax deeds.However, overall, Library Weekly gives this 4 out of 5stars for making the reader not only informed about hisoptions but also being able to take actionable itemsout of the book.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS:1. The Beginner's Guide to Real Estate Tax Lien and Tax Deed AuctionsISBN 0978834607 at other online bookstores"
3,Its an OK book,"I liked and disliked this book. What I liked about this book was that it has a lot of information which is very worthwhile for a beginner. On the other hand, what I disliked was that the content is pre-2008. Most of the methods and ideas do not apply to 2011 financial environment and some programs discussed are not available now. Overall, it is an ok book to have."
3,Great Review for Beginners - Elizabeth & Jameson Thottam,"A nice book for beginners in real estate.My husband, Jameson Thottam (he used to work with Real Estate firms such as Homestore and IndyMac Bank), and I recently entered the residential real estate market and we found this book somewhat useful in terms of teaching the core secrets (i.e., valuation, SEC II stat techniques, tax implications and flippying and insider trading tips of how to find/negotiate the best properties).We have used this book in examining multiple properties and can't recommend it enough. I personally made my first purchase using this book. Trust us, Elizabeth and Jameson Thottam....we've been in the business for the last two years now and think this book is a good starter.- The Thottam family"
1,Stiff and not true to size,This is a very stiff shoe. I ordered the size to match a size 7 US. It was cut very small.
2,size issues,The Fly Flot sandal is very narrow and is more like a size 6 than a size 6.5 - 7.High arches......forget it !
3,The World of Late Antiquity AD 150-750: AD 150-750 (Library of World Civilization),It is not a very good book. The Author writes almost as if this were a childs book.It was very difficult to sort out what was his comparison and what was actual fact.
1,Caveat emptor,"This is not a good book. The time I have spent reading this book has been mostly wasted. It does not compare to say, Bury's writings."
1,extreme low quality edition,This is one of the absolute classics of ancient history but Norton is doing its readers a huge disservice by selling this shoddy print-on-demand edition that looks like a very bad xerox with cheap covers normally used only on promotional ARCs. For $20 no less - A COMPLETE RIP-OFF!!!!
5,great ring,Very pretty ring with flawless colorless stone. Looks better than some expensive diamonds i've seen. Great service and quick delivery dispite holiday weekend. I ordered it around the 4th of July. Would order from them again and recommend to friends.
4,VERY pretty ring!!!!!!,"The tear drop ring is VERY pretty at a very reasonable, affordable price! I'll definitely buy from Gem Avenue again (& again)!!!"
1,Disappointed,"After hours of searching for a basic, clean ring, I found this and thought it would look beautiful on my hand.When I received it, it was not the right size. This may or may not have been the jewelers fault, who claimed the ring I tried on was a size 5.The settings were also twisted, making the Zirconia itself look bent and shifted to the right.I will be sending this back.Update: I tried going through the process of returning, but it turned out to be more of a hassle than it was worth.Knowing I would have to pay for shipping to send it back, then have to pay the fee for the post office to send it out- it just wasn't worth the hassle to only receive a couple of dollars back."
2,Only a very mild smell of mint,I was disappointed...am now the owner of 12 little bags of mint which don't have much of a mint taste or smell. Didn't try to return them as I live overseas and would have cost too much.
5,A great story told through text and photos,Roy Taylor does a fine job telling one of the most compelling sports stories of all time. The photos/captions combined with the text give a true and complete depiction of what the Bears have meant to the fans since their 1920 inception. This well-written book is a must-have for any Bears fan.
5,Oustanding Chicago Bears Book,"I had a great time reading this book. It has many photographs throughout the Bears' history, which made the reading more enjoyable. The story is thorough but not dull and boring. The chapters are parceled out in such a fashion that it keeps your interest, and enables you to put the book down and pick right back up again later. This book would be a delight for any Bears fans, young or old."
5,A GOOD HISTORY OF A CHICAGO INSTITUTION,THIS BOOK GIVES A GOOD HISTORY OF THE CHICAGO BEARS. I GOT IT AS AN XMAS GIFT FOR MY NEPHEW WHO ENJOYS READUNG IT MUCH.
1,Junk! Junk! Junk!,"I buy several costumes and accessories each year for an Oct. event I do and this was the poorest product I purchased this year! No wait, EVER! The plastic material ripped before I got them on my feet to try them out, they were outragously expensive and they are huge! They appear to be slip on, but they are a flimsy shoe cover with a small piece of black elastic on the bottom to hold on to your shoe. I didn't use them for my event and I won't next time either! Please don't waste your hard earned money on this product! I have never responded to a review I don't really have the time and this is how much I don't like this product."
1,Nothing like the picture,"I was extremely upset with this purchase. When looking at the picture, the ""latex"" feet seem to stand alone and hold some type of form; but in reality these are the most flemsy, flopping, piece of footwear Ive ever seen. Definitely not recommended. Ultimately its a piece of crap."
1,Do not buy these,Save your money and do not buy these units. They will not work long term and they failed in less than one year. It was difficult to get parts and they did not honor their warranty. Buyer beware. Please save your money and buy from a different manufacturer.
1,"Save your money, this product is crap! Save your money and buy Mitsubishi","Great design, but the terrible customer service is so bad that we ended up purchacing four of these products and when the broke (all four broke within 4 month) we were unable to get customer service.In the end we bought Mitsubishi units and threw out the terrible Klimaire units (into a junk heap.) Rude service, terrible people and a great product design.The are the best example of what is wrong with American manufacturing that we have ever seen. They suck."
1,D Minus,"The idea is neat and long overdue, but the execution is terrible...this book reads like an elementary school kid's attempt at a short story. The style is primitive, the situations seem forced (like a formula - a book about growing up must have ingredients A,B,C,...), and I am not even commenting about certain axioms the author assumes regarding the equations between GPAs and relationships. There could not be a bigger disadvertisement for Indian writing in English."
3,Simplistic portrayal,"This is the kind of book that you read and forget about quickly. I cannot tell how accurately it portrays life in IITs, but it sounds convincing enough. It has an interesting story, but the writing is too simplistic, even amateurish. Often it reads like like it was written by a college student for a few of his friends to share a chuckle with. The characters aren't fully fleshed out, and it misses numerous opportunities to make good book out of it. As we say in India, it is nothing more than a 'timepass'."
1,Poor Writing,"Granted, no one expects a new author to be a Shakespeare as one reviewer has put it. However, one does expect a decent plot, well developed characters and a rudimentary amount of style.This book has got nothing among the above but a lot of hype surrounding the way it has been marketed.The plot is shallow, a celebration of slackers in the world who are portrayed as the wise ones. The whole point of the book, the story and the marketing and associated success points in one single direction - mdeiocre stuff will grant you success, hard work is for fools. Unfortunately, I don't buy that.Want something good to read that has come out of India, try early Vikram Seth, Rohinton Mistry or Jhumpa Lahiri."
1,Damp Squib,"I just don't understand the hype surrounding this book. A weak plot, insipid style and non-existent depth. It is not even mediocre, it is poor.Too bad we can't rate it zero."
4,he real buddy holly story,This is another view from Paul McCartney on the story of Buddy Holly.It is quite a good view and is worth concidering.
3,Sorry Buddy,"Sorry Buddy. Paul McCartney had the money to do a much better job telling your story that this. This was not well put together, written or filmed. This looks like something that a fledgling college student film maker would do. They did not do you honor Buddy."
2,disappointed,I got the VHS of the Real Buddy Holly Story and it wasn't closed-captioned. So I got the DVD in hopes it would have subtitles...it didn't...I wasted my money on something I should not have brought. Wish this website was honest when it said no closet-captioned instead of saying it is.
5,THIS is the video/movie to watch about Buddy Holly,"Kudos to Paul McCartney for making sure the true story of the greatest rocker of all got told. The movie ""The Buddy Holly Story"" isn't his story; this is. Here Buddy Holly is portrayed by Charles Hardin Holley (Buddy's legal name).It is slow moving at times, but the film footage of Buddy himself is worth it! He was quite a performer and quite a man. One gets a little taste of how much rock and roll lost when the plane went down.So, if you want the REAL story about Buddy Holly, get this movie!"
3,Found something better than Dearborn,I recently used CCH Wall Street Financial Training's Series 7 materials. I found them to be excellent. I failed my Series 7 exam first time around using Dearborn's materials. I found that Dearorn covered a lot of material that wasn't on the actual exam. CCH Wall Street's material was very readable. I would also recommend using their online testing tool. I walked into the exam the second time with no suprises! Best stuff out here is CCH Wall Street's.
5,Fast delivery at a very reasonable price!,"I have always wanted to study for the Series 7 exam. This review book is incredibly comprehensive, and won't stretch your bank account, or wallet! I highly recommend it for anyone who is a serious, dilligent student!"
5,"Better for grad or high-level, good for novice as well","Many discrete-event simulation books make this book unique. Banks didn't focus particularily on some packages, but the foundation of discrete-event simulation. I think this book intended to people who has some simulation background. It's also a good reference for researchers or grad students as well as practitioners since many literature and simulation vendors are listed. For no-simulation-background reader, this book may be a good starting point -as the first book for simulation. However, you may need other related books if you want to learn some packages. Not a bad book at all, very recommend."
4,Is a excelent book...,The book is excelent. The tips and event simulations projects are useful (if you are in simulation and research operation market). I have four stars for this book because all the models are event oriented...Don't buy if you need study dynamic models in diferential equations.
5,Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1 MP,I have owned this camera for over two years. It was an upgrade from a point and click camera. I will never go back to the point and click. I do not have any camera of this quality to compare it to. It has been easy to learn to use. What I like most is the ability to control everything manually. The clarity of the photos are great. I have been able to blow them up and maintain the clarity of the photo.
5,Wonderful camera,I am a huge fan of Canon. I have owned and used the Canon Rebel SLR 35mm for years. I finally took the plunge and bought the Rebel XTi and love it! I went to a pro baseball game last night and took some awesome pictures using my zoom lens. You can't go wrong with the XTi!
5,Perfect,"It is a perfect material giving quality and more than everything easy to use.If you hesitate, go with this kind of product because it really gives you the liberty to choose funny or technical approach of taking pictures...Patrick"
5,Good performance at good price,"I was debating between this camera and Nikon D40X, and decided to buy this camera instead. Nikon D40X only has 3 autofocus points and not enough for me. Nikon D80 probaby would be a good choice but a lot more expensive. Canon Rebel XTi got all the features I need at a reasonable price.I had very good experience with Canon cameras. I owned a EOS 10 (film) and a Powershot S400 before and they are all excellent. So far I'm very happy with my new EOS Rebel XTi (well, except the box delivered by UPS was torn open...). The zoom range of the lens in the kit is not enough for me so I bought camera body only and got a 28-135mm lens with IS instead."
5,entering the magic of photography,"If you want to discover passion of the wold of photography don't try to jump to high at first.Theres a litle bit to learn,and go small and with the best.Buy rebel XTi,the wold smalest and ligthest DSLR.Its a litle imaging machine.If you are about to get serious into shooting pictures,just say cheese!The Rebel XTi 10.1MP will put white on your teeth."
3,Cool.........,"Pretty cool camera but I sold mine to my sister BRAND NEW for $50.00 cause it just wasnt what I was looking for I guess, It was too big to carry with you all the time & if you buy this you have to be prepared to ALSO spend at least $1,000.00 on all the extras that you need just to have it the way its meant to be (new lenses, flash, ect...ect...ect...) The lens that comes with it is OK but it doesnt zoom & you cant take up-close photos, the camera will NOT let you, it just turns black, so be prepared to spend spend spend!! Overall the camera itself was good quality though!! There is NO image stabilization & you cant view you photos on the LCD while you are shooting (you have to hold the camera up to your eye) Just read reviews & check many sites first to make sure it IS what you want!"
1,Terrible Camera,"I purchased this camera not even two months ago and recently sold it. This is the worst camera I've ever had. It constantly, no matter what setting I had on, underexposed the lighting in pictures, most of the time ruining the shot. Lighting is basically a photographer's lifeblood. And it's too big and bulky. The only good thing about this camera is how the clarity and sharpness are from such high megapixels. That's about it.Do NOT buy this camera, because you'll be sorry. I'm sorry I spent the 1300 dollars I did to get this piece of junk. Unless your not a bigtime photographer, you can take just as good shots with a cheap point and shoot camera."
1,didnt even get it,"ordered it on 2/04/08 and its 3/07/08 and i still havent gotten it or a refund yet. first im told to wait til 3/05/08 to get my refund. then im told wait til 3/09/08 for my refund. whats next, 3/15/08?? to be fair, ive gotten EVERYTHING else ive ever ordered from amazon but this. its just that nothing was ever as expensive as this. i think i may just stick to the cheaper stuff. waiting over a month for a $500+ refund is a loooong time."
1,Awful Piece of JUNK!,"If you want pictures that look like they were taken in a cave a mile underground inside a lead box, then this is the camera for you!"
1,IT NEVER WORK. TAKE CARE WITH THIS SELLER.,"I receive in perfect time and useless camera. It came without memory card. THATS OK i had to go to best buy (where i did not want in first place to buy the camera) and i bought the card..... the camera put an error message on screen. Then i said well, lets go again to best buy and chenge the card. THEY told me it almost impossible but we change the card for you. SAME ERROR MESSAGE. I tried to format the card.... SAME ERROR. This coulb be my 8th camera digital almost all SONY and it is my second CANON. FIRST TIME THAT CAME BROKEN / NOT WORKING."
2,Canon Rebel XTi,"Do not buy this camera.I bought a new one, & the Sandisk Ultra II Compact Flah memory card just would not go in. Eventually all the pins broke. The Sandisk is made in China. Buy a Nikon."
1,Just a Shutterbug,"Cannon..... I think not. Try Sony. You will be happy, Save money, And have a better product, That takes better photo's. - Cannon, can you say shutter freeze?????????"" your products under $3000.00 are garbage. and there it is.........."
5,CANON DIGITAL,Loved my Christmas gift; still learning all the ins & outs but takes great photos & easy to use!
3,lyinh love camera.,"The camera looking good, compact if comparetion w/ Nikon,but the flash light not ennough, that why the pics very dark,even I try to set diffence stype the light they was designed.but won't work better. I'm not happy with Canon.the Sony better than, I have been used Sony, I still own 1."
2,digital camera body,"I purchases what I thought to be a ""new"" camera body. Upon receipt of the package and opening it, it was NOT new, but recently returned to amazon and still had the receipt from the previous purchaser. I can only hope that it was returned to some reason other than it was defective."
1,Underexposed,"This camera underexposes all photos taken in the automatic mode due to poorly programmed software. This is a very well documented problem with the model yet canon pretends that there is no issue. Obviously this doesn't affect photos taken in the manual modes but for this kind of money the camera should work better than my point and shoot on auto and sadly it doesn't. Aside from this issue, still a great camera, however canon support (or lack thereof) makes this overall deserving of 1 star."
4,Canon XTi 10.1MP review,"Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Black): Digital has finally become useful! This camera exactly as noted above has been everything I have been waiting for. No delay that I can tell, multiple shots just by holding down the button. User friendly selections and the ability to go totally manual in all aspects. With just this set up I took a pic which showed the detail down to the hairs on a spider's legs, outdoors at 2am, flash from camera and a porchlight."
5,Digital Camera on Steroids...,"This camera blows my mind. It has features and functions I never would have dreamed a camera to have...Now I have to say, I'm ""old"" (56) so I'm used to more dinosaur like cameras. But the Canon Rebel XTi is the absolute coolest thing I've ever used in photography. And, I'm just now learning it. It is like buying a Ferrari and only going 60! There is so much more this machine can do. IT is a dream camera, for me. I can hardly wait to figure it all out!!! lol"
5,Great Camera,"I had the Canon EOS Rebel XT. When it came to replace the XT I was looking for compatibility of parts and accessories. I was originally interested in the XSi with the 12.1 megapixle, but it uses different batteries and memory cards. So I went with the 10.1MP of the XTi.Use, I have loved the affordability of the EOS Rebel product lines. The improvement of the DIGIC processor in the XTi is fantastic.I have shot photos with this camera through Southern Utah at Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks, Moab, Virgin River Gorge, and the Grand Canyon. I also use it as my studio camera. It is a great, flexible camera."
4,happy enough....,"This is my first digital slr, despite that fact that I have used several others. I bought this camera when it first came out when it was around 700 bucks so it really sucks that it's now down to 600. But anyway, for the price it's unbeatable, I'm an amateur photographer and it gets the job done for me. When taking landscapes however, I would recommend a polarizing filter to counter the extremely over exposed skies, but other than that it's great. Right now it's my primary camera, but in the next few days I'll hopefully be getting the 5D, not to say that I won't still use my old faithful 400D :). TO sum it all up, great camera, great price, despite the fact that it is not a professional camera like a Mark Ds II, but obviously you can't expect that...."
1,DUST DUST DUST,"Although I love many things about this camera, I must share one major concern with anyone thinking about purchasing this camera: Dust. I bouhgt my camera kit 3 months ago, with a wonderful 50mm 1.8 lens. From switching back and forth between lenses, dust has landed on the COMS sensor, and the sonic dust removal system does nothing to remove it. It is noticeable in the pictures and the included software doesn't remove it at all. Had I know the camera needs to be sent away and cleaned professionally (at my cost) every 3 months, I think I would have rethought this purchase. I've owned many 35mm film camera over the years, and I have become good at cleaning them, but this sensor is just too delicate and the consequences of a mistake too great for me to own a camera like this. It looks like my window to return it to Amazon has expired too, so I think I might be stuck with a really wonderful camera that is totally impractical to use."
1,Check the Camera - There are many Cameras which are defective,"This camera has a lot of good features, but consistently underexposes in indoor photography. Indoor photos with the built in flash are also very poor.The exposure problem renders the auto modes. In the total manual mode also if you set the right speed and aperture then light meter shows that it is over exposing. Probably the problem is the light metering issue in the camera. The indoor photos are incredibly dark and underexposed.I also saw many people gave this complain, I hope this is not the problem of the camera model but couple of cameras which are having this issue.When you buy this camera, please check whether the camera is working properly in Auto mode in low light conditions. I had to return my camera due to this underexposure problem ."
2,XTI Failed,"After two weeks and 450 pictures the camera failed. Up until failure unit was excellent- easy to use and great pictures. Failure involved total malfunction of all camera function in other than automatic. Service was prompt and polite but online database was useless in trying to resolve problem. After minute with live support was advised to return camera to service depot, which I have since done. Bought Canon XTi because previous 35mm Rebel bought in 94 had been flawless and wanted to use existing zoom lenses. Expect unit back from warranty repairs in two weeks and we will see. But leaves an uneasy feeling with me regarding reliability, plus cost of shipping for warranty."
4,more camera than we needed,"....but still thrilled with the purchase. we'll never scratch the surface regarding the capabilities of this camera, but we're very happy with the purchase. Extremely good for sports photography. The rapid fire shooting is great."
4,Promising Camera But Underexposure Is An Issue,My new XTi underexposed & I've since learned that others have had this problem. Be aware of this correctable problem. Canon agreed there was an issue with my camera after I sent them a series of photos & histograms. Their service center gave fast service & appear to have corrected the problem. I've long used digital point & shoot cameras (Olympus & Kodak). This is my first SLR. I went to an SLR to get faster shots & hopefully greatly improved low light shots. The XTi certainly solved my need for faster shots. Initial evaluation of night/low light shots show great improvement over the non-SLR cameras. Photos of nightime lighted Christmas trees are not as blurry. Too early in the evaluation (plus I need to upgrade from the kit lens) to say it fully meets my desire for good low light shots.THe underexposure problem (both indoor & outdoor shots too dark) could be compensated for by increasing exposure by +2/3.
1,WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER,"I had a Rebel G with no problems for over a decade-never had a problem and did not consider another make of camera when I switched to a digital SLR-My Rebel XTi malfunctioned after only 8 months, and of course there were excuses as to why the warranty did not cover -BUYER BEWARE"
4,great camera,"BECAUSE OF A MEDICAL CONDITION, I USE A SINGLE LEG POLE AND A REMOTE SHUTTER SWITCH TO TAKE PICTURES, AND IT TAKES SUPER SHOTS...I DO NOT KNOW WHAT EOS STANDS FOR, BUT WHAT EVER IT MEANS I LIKE IT"
3,This camera takes Good Pictures,"This camera takes Good Pictures. just after I got this cam. I go out took some shoots in the street without even reading the manual. and The pictures I took is great. the shadow and highlight is prefect. one thing I don't like about this cam is the grip. It is plastic. It is not comfortable to hold for a long time. And keep in mind, it only have one LCD. Other than that I think this is a great camera."
1,Basic,"Got this camera as gift and after 3 months this camera was not producing good pictures, most of the pictures are fade or like blurr."
3,great picture taking camera,"I loved my xti but returned due to mislabel by amazon, it was advertised as coming with USM lens but it does not, plus Pentax/Samsung give you more for the money, I was not impressed with Nikon d80 either as it does not have IS and when using zoom in 60-135 range the pics were coming out blurry as hell."
1,Beware shady companies,BEWARE Broadway Photo and 1 Way Photo!!!! The reason why their prices are no is because the camera either does not include a battery or the battery the sell it with does not last long. The price spikes when you add a battery. Stick with the websites you are familiar with. Also it is very hard to get a hold them. Wait times are rediculous!
1,Canon Support is not worth it,"I purchased a camera from Canon and 2 months later mirror locks up, nothing works, my daughter is in Hong Kong on a once in a life time trip. There is a Canon Center in Hong Kong but this is a US warranty, they can not even talk to each other. Canon is not Worldwide as it claims on their web site. I will never buy another canon."
1,IT DIDNT WORK,I DONT LIVE IN THE STATES ... SO I WENT THERE AND BOUGHT THE CAMERA THROUGH AMAZON SO I COULD BRING IT BACK TO MY COUNTRY. IT WAS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND OF MINE SO Y DIDNT TURN IT ON AT THE TIME SINCE I THOUGHT... I WONT TAKE HIM THE PLEASURE OF DOING THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME.... BIG MISTAKE.. CAUSE WHEN I CAME HERE THE THING DIDNT WORK.. WE COULDNT TURN IT ON... AND WHEN I CONTACTED THE VENDOR THEY SAID I NEEDED THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING (WHICH OBVIOUSLY I DIDNT BRING WITH ME) ... ANYHOW... IT TURNED TO BE A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE.. NOW ILL HAVE TO REPAIR IT HERE.. CAUSE THE CAMERA IS BROKE...
4,Canon XTi,"This camera, in combination with the 60 mm f/2.8 macro lens, has made our photo work easy, simple and a pleasure to use. There have been no surprizes."
3,xti- good entry level dslr,"This is a good entry level camera that has a lot to give at a cheap price. However, I recommend the following:Do not get the kit lens. Its decent, but you can save your cash and buy a general purpose prime lens, like the 50 mm f1.4 ($300).I am happy with this camera, however I can't wait for canon to come out with a full frame sensor, at a below 1000 dollar price.I would also, like to see wider and more bracketing ability. 3 frames per bracket is not bad, but I wish it had more.My canon sx100 has a hacked firmware loaded that allows me to bracket multiple shots. The hack gives me the ability to alter f stop, as well as shutter speed for brackets. I'm hoping someone hacks the xti.Most annoying: When you want to bracket you need to dig into a menu. That sucks.proactive dust solution: I change lens a lot, so I'm happy that it has a proactive solution to dust. So far, I have not had a problem.Over all, a great camera to start out with."
5,A great digital SLR,"This is my first digital SLR and I'm glad I made this camera the first. It's easy to use and fun to learn all the features. The quality of photos are far superior to my previous point-and-shoot 2mp camera. Now that I have this camera, I'm taking a lot more photos and really satisfied with the results. The price is not too high that a first-time buyer is intimidated and not too low that you feel its a cheap starter. The kit lens (18 - 55mm) is okay for basic use but I'm already exploring to purchase a better lens. Overall, the Canon XTI is a great camera especially for digital SLR rookies."
5,An Amazing Camera!,"I am a pro wanna be and I am not well versed in technology, or capable of using a complicated camera, but I found this camera to be easy to use, and it produces excellent pictures without pouring over the manual. I have even figured out how to produce some special effects with a little manual reading. So I am very impressed."
5,Fabulous Camera!,"I've owned one of these for over three years now and have taken about 35,000 photos with it. I've never had it cleaned or serviced (I'm thinking about doing so, but the photos are still looking beautiful) and have used it in rain and snow, temperatures from -20 to 110 (F), low light, bright light, etc. without problems. I've even dropped it a couple times (though not on super hard surfaces) and it doesn't seem damaged in any way. The auto setting works great, but I use it in manual a lot, if for nothing more than to take advantage of the RAW setting. I expect it to last several more years and will definitely buy Canon in the future."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great camera, it can do everything you need, even to get your photos published. I now have > 30 photos published in top scientific journals and books. Owned mine for < 1 yr now, it's great!"
5,another great canon digi cam,this is the 7th or 8th (lost count after awhile) canon camera i've owned and it's about the best. perfectly-sized (not too small nor too big) w/easy to understand controls - nice history here going back to my 35 slr film cameras. the 2.5 lcd screen works well and it's fairly fast for reviewing pix compared to my earlier 6.3 meg rebel eos body.kudos again to canon.
5,Rebel xti,"I have had a progression of Canon cameras beginning with the SLR Rebel 2000. When I moved into digital SLR it only made sense to go with a name I could trust--not to mention I could use the lenses I already had! Over three years ago I purchased the 6.1 mp Canon Rebel. Almost two years later I handed that one down to my amateur photographer daughter and bought the 8.1 mp Canon XT. A month ago I gave the XT to my daughter, who passed the Rebel along to my son--and bought the 10.1 Rebel XTi for myself! Now there are three very happy members of my family. These cameras are everything the consumer and expert reviews promise--ease of use if I want to go auto, the ability to capture some great pictures by playing with some of the manual features and nothing but praise from everyone for the results. My whole family highly recommends the Canon Rebel for any photographer who loves great pictures."
5,The Digital Rebel Just Keeps Getting Better!,"I bought the camera for my wife -- it is her third in the successive generations of Digital Rebels. She thinks the camera is fantastic. Each has been an enhancement to the prior, with the base model having been quite good to begin with."
4,Great buy and easy to use,"I've had this camera for going on 4 months, and I absolutely love it. This is my first digital SLR camera, and I'm really pleased with it. The image quality is really sharp, and it's very easy to use. I happen to have a background in photography, so it may be a bit easier for me than it is for a complete novice. However, I find the controls to be very convenient, and I lovve the resolution and size of the LCD display on the back of the camera.I've read that the camera is a bit harder to handle for people with larger hands, but I don't have that problem. It's relatively lightweight and easy to handle."
4,Great Starter SLR,"This XTi is a solid entry level digital SLR. It is many auto features for a novice like my self to use. As my abilities increase the camera has potential as well. After using the quick start guide I have been able to use this camera almost immediately. It is versatile in that you can mount EF-S and EF model lenses with the camera. It is a good starter SLR. I do recommend buying the lens separately from the standard 18-55mm lens. The kit lens lacks the USM and the IS, but features add to the camera."
2,Not a worthy upgrade from 350D XT,Pros:1.Better hand grip2.Nice 2.5 screen.3.Faster burst4.Solid CF card door.Neutral:1. Proactive anti-dust. Haven't used long enough to tell the effectiveness2. 9-point AF. No apparent improvement of the old 7 point AF. Nikon uses11 pt AF and I heard its AF is worse than Canon...Con:1. Freezes after consecutive flash shots or burst shots without flash. Freezes upto 1 minute. Apparently the old battery is not up for the job.2. Dark shots more often than XT (350D) - metering problem.3. 10mp only gets the file larger and uses up CF faster. Not much else.Bottom line:I'll wait for the 30D upgrade...
4,Great DSLR at an ok price,"My hat is off to Canon on the body, sensor, processor, and feature set on this camera. It's great. It takes beautiful pictures that I'm very pleased with. There is definitely a sticker shock when you start piecing together your DSLR kit. I know that I've spent about $2300 on the camera and 4 lenses. It's unfortunate that you still have to spend that to get a precision photography experience, but that's how it is. You can't go wrong with this DSLR.My only complaint would be that I'd trade the 2.5"" LCD back to the XT for the smaler LCD and the monochrome LCD info screen. The 2.5"" LCD info screen on this XTI doesn't work like I'd like it to. It's a small complaint though and a small price to pay for a 10 megapixel sensor."
2,Consistently Dark/Underexposed Pictures,"The camera produces dark pictures and needs manual exposure compensation to correct this. I have used a Canon film SLR camera for years and compared to that, it certainly feels there is something wrong in the metering of this camera. I am returning mine tomorrow."
3,NOT an upgrade,"bought the Rebel XTI with 2 stabilizer lenses. Everything works as advertised. I am really disappointed in the quality of the pictures. I have a couple other low end cameras that give me a sharper focused picture than the XTI. I live on a hill overlooking a valley with Zion national park on the other side. I love taking pictures of the sunrises over Zion. Both my old Fuji S5000 and my Fuji F30 give me MUCH sharper images. I have had it for about 6 months and a few thousand pictures, so I guess I'll just bite the bullet and start over."
5,OMG - it's the LOVE of my LIFE!!!,i only have one piece of advice:GO FOR IT! you won't have any regrets!!well maybe two:they're right about the kit-lens! don't get it. it really is nothing more than just a paperweight
5,Great camera!!!,"I owned a Fuji Finepix digital camera and gave up on digital because the camera didn't seem to produce the quality that I got with film, so I went back to using my Canon 35mm. Two of my friends owned the Canon Rebel XTI and raved about it, so I decided to give digital another try and I'm so glad that I did. This camera is a God-send for me. I am pretty electronically-impaired and this camera is so simple to use and it give GREAT quality pics!"
5,AWESOME!! AMAZING!!,This camera is amazing. I have small children (3 and 2 yrs old) who don't sit still very long. The camera focus and shutter speed are very fast - perfect for capturing children in the moment.I also purchased the SanDisk Extreme III CompactFlash Card. It writes extremely fast.The automatic settings take fantastic pictures. I saw some reviews complaining about low exposure on inside shots. I have not experienced that.I have taken over 400 pictures since Christmas Day 2007 and I have not had to recharge the battery yet.ALL AROUND EXCELLENT CAMERA!
5,I love this. This is wonderful,"This is my first SLR camera. I switched from Point and shoot canon powershot sd450. Since I am not professional photographer, I don't want to shed more money. I searched all over the internet last week for a best Digital SLR camera. At last I selected Canon Digital Rebel Xti. I am very satisfied with this camera. It is too good. Picture quality is very good. I bought 75-300mm III USM Lens along with this. My first picture with this lens is Moon. WOW it came very good. I would definitely recommend this to any one who wants to switch from Point and Shoot."
1,"Good Camera, Bad Exposure","This camera has a lot of good features, but consistently underexposes shots significantly in all light conditions, including full sun. If you don't believe this, type in ""XTI underexposure"" in your browser! You will see HUNDREDS of posts. Indoor photos with the built in flash are particularly bad.The exposure problem renders the auto modes worthless - not appropriate for an $800 camera."
5,Amazing Camera!,"After a little more than a month reading reviews I finally decided to go for this camera (Canon Rebel XTi). And I think I made the right choice. This camera has not disappointed me. Every picture I take comes out with outstanding quality. It's just amazing.Some people complain about the fact that Canon got rid of the small lcd screen. I've used the previous model (Rebel XT) and not having the little lcd screen doesn't bother me at all. All the information needed is displayed on the big lcd and it's great.One more thing, this camera performs great under low light conditions. Check some of the images that I uploaded here.Okay! In conclusion, this is an awesome camera, and although some might find it not so comfortable, I totally recommend it."
4,very satiesfied,"Works very well,looks like new also I bought it as a refurbished one,no problems since I bought it.Good Choice!"
3,Disappointed with underexposure issue,"I had high hopes for this camera. I was impressed with all of the features and ease of use. However, after shooting around 200 pics with nearly all of them being underexposed, I have decided to return the camera. Most of my pictures were underexposed by 2/3 to 1 stop, and yes I know that I can easily use exposure or flash compensation, but after spending nearly $800 I figure the camera should shoot well without me having to do that. The underexposure makes the full auto mode completely useless, therefore none of my family would be able to use the camera. I know some people are getting this issue fixed after having sent their camera off to Canon, but again I don't think I should have to do this. I will move on to a different camera."
5,Great camera,"This takes WONDERFUL pictures. We recently visited Hawaii and brought back pictures that with enlargement, let us see things we couldn't see with the naked eye. Great quality--no issues with shaking (though I like my coffee well enough) as reported by others. Great rapid-fire succession shots. I chose this product because of great reviews and recommendations in Consumer Reports."
1,Buyer beware,"The Canon XTi is a very capable camera, and at first, well worth the cost. There is one glaring issue.... the CF memory card. It is a many-pinned nightmare. I believe there are 28 separate pins on an array in the camera. One dead center of the pin array came loose- on the backside of the printed circuit card inside the camera. It was loose and bent, failing the camera. For whatever reason (lack of customer service I suspect) Canon service refused to warrant the pin array. No damage to the card pin slots, yes I know how to CAREFULLY install the card, and a single loose pin in the center of the array with all others OK, I said? No matter, operator error Canon maintained. Also, Canon sent a canned email response after staying on the customer service line for over 20 minutes. My suggestion- find a camera from another manufacturer with a SD style card! $260.00 for a repair on a camera less than one year old is a crime. 1/3 of the sale price for a pin array repair?"
1,Unreliable - Won't Boot,"After careful use for about 2 years (never dropped or abused), our xTi will not turn on. Canon has been less than helpful. They said to send it in, then when they received it, they said it would not boot (which we already knew and explained to them on the initial call). To fix it would be a minimum of $227 and a maximum of who knows what! They should have told us that before we sent it in and we could have saved the shipping expenses.Research on the web shows that this problem is widespread. After purchasing Canon cameras and numerous lens all my life, I have no further confidence in them!!! Be forewarned before you waste your money too on a Canon. It is unfortunate that Canon won't take responsibility for an apparent design defect."
1,"HATE IT!!! ""BUSY"" ALL THE TIME!","OK, I am not a professional photographer or anything, but this camera is driving me nuts!!! I bought this camera from Amazon about a year ago and I mainly use it to take photos of my 1 yr old daughter. After taking about 20 shots while using the internal flash, the camera starts giving me ""busy"" errors and I would have to wait about 15 seconds before I can take another shot! I literally have to wait for 15 seconds on EVERY shot after the error appears! As a result, I would miss a lot of great shots of my daughter, because the flash has to recycle itself! I have read different forums online and many other people are getting the same problem, but Canon refuses to admit that there is anything wrong with the camera. I have had many Canon cameras before this and I never have any problems. Even my Canon SD450 point and shot takes photos using the flash and NEVER gives this error. This camera costs a lot more and performs very poorly."
5,Canon Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera,A great camera. This thing takes great shots (the pictures are incredibly clear) and the stabilizer works great.
5,Canon EOS XTI Digital Camera,"I've had this camera almost 2 months now and I love it more every time I use it. We just had an ice storm and I took some of the most amazing pictures! This camera is easy to use and very versatile. I did invest in a good quality photo software program and it expands my photography efforts tremendously. I'm not technical, so I can't talk as if I am...all I can say is that this camera will not let you down or disappoint you. Well worth the money....but then this was the best deal around."
5,A great camera buy,"I have been wanting an SLR digital camera for some time and I am really glad I bought this one. It has many different options for taking creative pictures as well as a very simple ""automatic"" mode for taking pictures without any hassle whatsoever. The pictures are awesome and I am glad I made the decision to buy this camera. I love it. The instruction manual is like a novel, so just take it a bit at a time. You will be taking great pictures the moment you open up the box."
4,Nice camera for first digital user,"I have been a film camera buff all my life. I have looked at digital cameras for the past several years but was waiting on the features that I have in my film SLR's. This was reasonably priced and pretty full featured (lacking only in spot metering). I gave it a try. I am well satisfied with it. I have shot several thousand images and find the images more than satisfactory, the camera easy to use and am becoming a digital convert."
2,Great Camera Horrible Media,"I have had this camera for a couple of years now and I really liked it until recently while I was in Italy and the camera wouldn't read my CF card. Fortunately, I got a full 4GB card full before it failed.When I got home I realized that one of the pins in the camera was bent and now Canon wants $220 to fix it...........ARGHHHH.Though no fault of my own, I have two San Disk CF cards and one of them goes in label up and the other one goes in label down...GO FIGURE?? WTF.This is just STUPID. To make it worse, I just bought a cool Tamron 18-270mm lens and if it weren't for this I'd throw this POS in the trash and buy a Nikon or some other camera that uses SD instead of CF.Even if I fix the pins there's is no assurance this can't happen again and then it'll be another $220 to fix. Forget about lending my camera to ANYBODY who might do the same thing.This is a very disappointing development so BEWARE if you buy. I wish I had know this was a problem."
4,XTi,"Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Black Body Only)I love this camera! The ease of use and the simplicity of the buttons and placement of all the controls. I have added the Opteka battery grip to my XTi and have had no problems with either. I like that it has the dust removal option. I try not to let dust into the camera body, but anyone who changes lenses knows that it is an almost impossible thing to do.I have recently purchased 3 L series lenses, and with the XTi, I can get print sizes of 53""x36"". As this is the high end of the ""Beginner"" series of Canon DSLR's, I find that this camera does an amazing job at what it was designed for."
5,I love this camera.,"I love this camera. It is fun and easy to use. The photos are great right out of the box and it is pretty fast. I used to have a Sony Cybershot 7MP point and shoot and was unhappy with the color, image quality, and auto-focus speed. The moment of opportunity for perfect shot were often lost and the images were not that great. This camera is fast and produces great quality photos. Definately worth the money to get away from the constraints of a point and click type camera."
4,"Yes, I'm an idiot.","Canon Digital Rebel XTi is a fantastic middle ground camera for those of us that can't spend thousands on top end equipment. I did a lot of research before buying it and it really does live up to the reviews. Any idiot can use it and get great results ... (that would be my husband and I) but our son the ""college student"" can also use it for his photography classes, although he would prefer a macro lens in the camera bag too. Let's just pass Calculus first aye ..."
4,Congratulations Teacher!,I am a principal of an elementary school. I use this book to announce an upcoming pregnancy to my staff. I present this book to the mother-to-be at a staff meeting. The teachers then use the book to announce her pregnancy to her class. The book is great at helping children understand what to expect when their teacher is expecting.
4,Great book!,"I didn't know how I was going to tell my class that I was having a baby, so I was so excited to find this book. The pictures are very nice and the story is sweet. It's a great way to share the big news with some very important people in your life. My principal loves the book so much that she bought a copy for herself to share with other staff members in the future!"
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"What a surprise...This album gets better as you go along. It definitively is the most mature album of AOB; more polished, interesting, more commercial (in a good sense).Pop fans should be in heaven. Rock fans, while won't fall in love, might actually enjoy few tracks (makes for a good 'car' CD as you are trying to stay awake in a traffic jam).Tracks that should be noted here include (in no particular order): Da Capo, What's The Name of The Game, Change With The Light, Hey Darling, and Wonderful Life (although the fans of the original version might find this one almost sacrilegious)"
5,Loads of fun,I purchased this on a whim at the mall and my 11 yr old thinks its the 'best' game to come into this house in a very long time. We also attend a 'tween' game night and 'Man Bites Dog' is great with the 10-15 yr old group as well. The game is a quick play if needed or we can go on for hours. This a keeper!
5,Man Bites Dog--fun for all ages,This is a game that anybody can play. My kids and grandkids love it. We can sit down and play for a couple of hours at a time. I received my order in a very short time and it was in excellent condition.
5,Man Bites Dog,"Ordered in UK, delivered in USA. Brilliant! Gift for friends of family of five, they love it as we do!"
2,Not much fun,Sounded like a fun game. Played it with my mom and daughter (19 yo). We didn't find it fun. This is more like a game for kids. It would help them with reading. Going to give it to a friend who has children. If your looking for a fun party game this is not it. If you are looking for a game to play with your kids and help improve their reading skills this is it.
1,Rules are unclear,"The rules for this game are very unclear. It comes with a single card with the rules and the only rule explaining what is valid is:""Headlines may be funny and unbelievable, but they must be structurally sound. Acceptable: Blind Dog Weeps for Mayor Unacceptable: Vaccine Tells on Blonde. If the Majority of the players decide that a headline does not make sense, the player who laid the headline down must pick it up and submit a new headline."" It does not say why that is unacceptable, it's grammar is structurally sound (Noun verb preposition noun). Is it unacceptable because a vaccine can't tell on something and therefore it doesn't ""make sense?"" What defines ""makes sense"" in the terms of this game, then? Would any impossible headline therefore not ""make sense?"" That would remove a huge amount of funny headlines.Every time my friends and I have tried to play this game we've ended up arguing over a headline on whether it is valid or not, so this game just sits on the shelf."
1,dumb game don't bother,"I got this game thinking it sounded fun, it wasn't. I have purchased a lot of card games and this is the only one I was disappointed in. You want a fun card game buy Five Crowns, Phase 10, or Rummy Royal. All three are very fun and entertaining."
3,Can be a learning toy too!,"We bought this for someone for their birthday and now she's using it in her classroom.The goal of the game is to build the most hilarious sentence for a ""Headline"" of a newspaper. Some VERY creative headlines can be made. And it can teach proper sentence structure in the classroom. Lots of laughter ensues and even early readers can play this game."
3,"If you don't love language and words, might not be for you","Spouse and I are both English majors and love word play. We took this game to friends' house for game night and found it to be frustrating and not fun for one of the people who joined us. She could not form headlines that made sense with any of her cards. It made her feel stupid, and couldn't get past it.We thought it was a fun game, but it wasn't fun for her at all and we couldn't help her get past that. The game was quickly set aside for a more traditional board game."
4,loads of fun!,"We play this for family nights. It is a blast! We all get a kick out if this game, from our 9-year-old son, to the 40-something mom. Easy to learn, fun to play. I'm glad I bought this game."
1,I only skimmed this book a little but....,"To put it simply, this book takes all the amusing situations in Simpsons episodes and SUCKS the funny right out of it to make a ""philosophical"" point."
5,Not for the faint of heart or light of mind,"If you are expecting a light comedic romp, this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking for a fascinating primer on basic philosophy which ties in the most enjoyable TV show in history - this is the book for you."
2,Not what I thought,Guess I didn't read the review thoroughly because I bought this for high school students to read and its level is way above what I expected to be interesting and engaging.
4,A good book for intermediate philosophers.,"This book is REALLY cool! It can be entertaining, but also enlightening at the same time. I would probably recommend this book only to those who have seen a lot of simpsons episodes, and/or studied ethics. It's a fun read, and I'd really recommend it! It's limitation to ""experienced people"" though gives it four stars instead of a full five."
1,Borrrrrrrring.......,"This book is less interesting that straight-up philosophy. The relations/references to the Simpsons are normally a stretch or at the very least not funny, which to me makes the reference pointless."
3,Great for lovers of both the Simpsons and philosophy!!,"I am a huge fan of the Simpsons but found this book to be slightly boring and some chapters read more like a text book for a college class. I LOVED the book ""The Gospel According to the Simpsons"" which I read straight through without putting down. I guess religion just interests me more (hence why I gave this book only three stars). If you love the Simpsons, philosophy, and can follow what the authors are talking about you will love this book."
4,MMMM--Philosophy,"If you ever wonder exactly what all those deep thinkers are really saying, but don't want to plow through their self congratulatory language, and you like the Simpsons, this is the book for you. In applying philosophical schools of thought to various Simpson characters and plots, the authors help explain those basic schools in terms readily understandable to fans of the show. And they underscore what we fans have always known, The Simpsons might just be the most important TV show of our generation."
5,The Buying of this Book and Philosophy,"I recieved this as a Christmas present not really knowing what I was in for. I thought, this will be something nice to read with tea in the morning or something- so I decided to read. Sorry, couldn't stop. Whether or not the philosophical aspects of the Simpsons mentioned in the book were intentional or not the book is quite an englightening expierence. Many may disagree on this but I found much of this book to be a large philosophy lesson using the Simpsons as a sort of demo reel. So it dosent really come down to whether or not you're a Simpsons fan, just whether you like philosophy or not. In my opinion- give it a read."
4,Better than I expected,"This book, although not great, was better than I expected. Some of the chapters are both interesting as well as entertaining in their discussions of the Simpsons as philosophy. Others are somewhat weaker, and there are a few duds. But overall, I thought it turned out pretty well, and some of the chapters are pretty imaginative even if the philosophical significance of it all gets stretched a little thin at times. So I give the authors of each chapter credit for being pretty creative if nothing else. Overall, not a bad book and more interesting and entertaining than I was expecting."
2,More Simpsons Please,"This book was less about how philosophy relates to the Simpsons than it was how the Simpsons relate to philosophy. Almost every essay would describe a tenet of philosophy in great detail and then it would somehow remind them of this one instance in The Simpsons. I felt the essays would be both more enjoyable and interesting if more of The Simpsons were in the essays. It seemed to me that The Simpsons were just the ruse to get me to read a book about philosophy. I felt a lot of the essays were not successful proving their theses in relation to The Simpsons. On the plus side, I did enjoy the essay about Lisa."
3,Dont be fooled by the title,"I bought this book expecting a light hearted read. Being an avid fan of the Simpsons, I was keen to study the characters from a tongue in cheek, philosophical perspective...However, what you actually get with this book is a series of philosophical essays that reference the Simpsons' characters occasionally in order to relate the subject matter to the average reader, and to stop their mind from wandering.In summary, if you want to learn a little about philosophy without weighing in at the deep end, then this is the book for you. If you are picking up this book because you are a fan of the series or want to learn more about the Simpsons, dig a little deeper."
5,From a British Point of View. . .,Sometimes we in the US cannot see the forest for the trees when it comes to our educational system. Brighouse seems to wade through some of the nonsense in a commonsense way.
2,Useless! Do not waste your money!,"Most of the people joining the forensic field already have a substantial background in biology/chemistry. The 2/3 of the book is a lame attempt to explain the basics of genetics. If you ever have had genetic course, you will skip the first 2/3. If your major is in art or business, you still need to read something more substantial about genetic inheritance. The only part of the book going in the depth of Forensic DNA analysis is a chapter about paternity testing, but... The author of that chapter could not adequately explain how to calculate the probability of inheritance of a genetic locus/marker from alleged father for Paternity Index calculation. The ""explanation"" in that chapter clearly shows that author DOSE NOT UNDERSTAND the Paternity Index calculation."
2,Failed to deliver as promised,"This Mother's Day order was represented as being a ""Platinum Collection"" bouquet, and what arrived instead was a down-graded selection of mediocre cut flowers, some of which were already wilting. Included was a note stating that ""Mother Nature"" had not cooperated in providing Falcon Farms with the assortment of blossoms as represented in their online offering, but they had made ""appropriate"" substitutions. Having ordered less expensive arrangements from this vendor in the past, I find their decision to offer a lesser product (and with no offer of a refund for the downgrade) inexcusable. I do not recommend this vendor, and will not use them in the future. Their quality control (not to mention customer service) is obviously slipping; I recommend you take your business elsewhere."
1,Avoid this merchant!,Avoid Falcon Farms! They do not deliver what they advertise. I ordered approximately one week ago and did not receive anything even remotely similar to what was pictured in the ad. I feel completely deceived. Avoid!
3,Finicky with Windows 7 but works!,"I do a lot of scanning in my home business and when it came time to upgrade my first computer from XP Pro to Windows 7, my old Visioneer 7100 scanner was not compatible and had to go so I replaced it with this model..Never been a fan of Visioneer's software as I always used XP Pro's Scanner and Camera Wizard to scan my documents, but with Windows 7, it was required to load the software to get the driver needed to be recognized by Windows 7 and then having to use the new Fax and Scan option just made using this model finicky as it would throw scan error messages up during the preview scan.. Does not automatically crop the image in Windows 7 (or I have not yet figured out how to get it to do an auto crop yet) and have to manually crop the image I wish to scan.The 35mm option is useless to me..It does work in Windows 7; that I can confirm, but I may look for another model that's 'friendlier' to use with Windows 7.."
5,visioneer one-touch 9520 good product,Very fast service from the vendor. It does every thing I need it to do.
3,It broke down after three months,Great product but sadly its lamp burnt out after three months and I to replace it cost more than the original product. It was very disappointing because I loved the product.
4,Witnesses to War,"The book I read was Witness to War by Michael Leapman. This book was about eight true-life stories of children that were sent to concentration camps, and others who the Germans tried to make into German citizens. The German police and army shipped off some kids to different places so they did not get caught. A lot of the Jewish people that got sent to camps were well-respected people in a society of German. Most of the people in this book are Jewish but one of the kids is a gypsy. I think this book was very good. It is very odd that people can treat others so cruel."
5,Wow now that's a drill!!!,"I am a new homeowner with constant repairs, and projects. The repairs included building a large fence to close in my back yard. I use the tool for almost any job around the house. It has inspired me to try other projects including building a deck. The drill as the most power I have ever seen in a cordless tool and I look forward to increasing my Milwaukee tool collection.-also the all metal chuck never slips, unlike other drills I've used."
2,Damages metal and loses soap suds,"I just switched sponges about 4 days ago to this sponge. I have noticed a HUGE difference, and I don't like what I've noticed. First, this sponge requires more soap than my previous sponge. I don't know why, but I have to add soap more frequently to keep it soapy. Also, I've noticed that the scrubber side damages my pots, pans, and appliances. I use to be able to lightly scrub on my trash can and toaster with the abrasive side of my old sponge, and it never damaged the surface. Now I have incidentally damaged those and the bottoms of my pots and pans as I scrub food. I haven't added more pressure, but for some reason this sponge is stripping away at the metal when my old one didn't. Time to switch back!"
4,Wildly imaginative; in need of editing,"There's enough imaginative riffs in this slim volume to fill a dozen books. Not only is author Whitewolf chock to the brim with creative concepts and fun, he's a competent storyteller and has a firm grasp of plot, pacing, and other narrative tricks essential to good stories.The book does suffer though from a lack of strong editing. Aside from cramming way too much into one book, there are numerous unforgiveable grammatical errors (most noticeably ""it's/its"" confusion) and the short, choppy sentences and minimal paragraphing are annoying and distracting to the reader. When writing for young people, attention to such details is even more vital.I'd loved to see what a talented editor might do with this talented author."
3,Better for Kids than Adults,"This is a fast-paced and whimsical story that will appeal to the younger fantasy fan. It's full of interesting characters, creatures and places. It gets my nod for inventiveness, although I did feel some of the characters were too similar and hard to tell apart. (Not the main characters, though!)As an adult reader, I found a few rough spots in the writing. Especially, I would have liked more background detail on the Elcarim Foundation, who ""founded"" it, and how it relates to the mundane world. For instance, Alexandra seems to take the existence of magic totally for granted, and I found myself wondering if all ""mundane people"" feel this way, or if the magicians have to hide from the outside world.I thought the ending was weak, the villain converted too easily. However, my kids did like the ending and thought it was just fine.Deby Fredericksauthor of ""The Magister's Mask"""
2,Almost useless.,"This does not do CVS justice and is a terrible reference. I give it two stars just for existing, but it doesn't provide anything you can't get from cvs -H. As such, this should be a reference based around what you want to do with CVS, not just the syntax of the commands (which you can easily get from cvs itself). For example, to find out how to make a bugfix branch is impossible. I don't think it's even mentioned. It's way easier to consult the official documentation. There's not even an index or any way to quickly look up anything, and the book is only 75 pages!If you want a real CVS reference, print out the official docs. It has much better info, serves as a great reference, and has an index as well as table of contents (neither of which are in this book)."
3,Online documentation is better.,It's an OK book if you have some knowledge of CVS already but as most people would use CVS in an networked environment the online documentation is actually better and up to date.
4,Useful,"I often find myself on teams that have little to no experience with CVS. This pocket reference serves as a quick reminder for them on how to interact with CVS. Until you learn CVS well, make sure to have this by your side."
2,Why did I buy this?,"A couple of years ago I started using CVS for large projects with lots of files. I bought this book back then, but have used it very little. Everything is in the UNIX man pages, and there is online documents."
1,Music CD,I first heard Martha in the Leonard Cohen concert 'I'm your man'. She was fantastic. This particular CD went directly to Good Will. It was horrible. I can't understand why someone with so much talent and such a wonderful and creative voice finds the need to create an entire album to hate and profanity.
2,Major disappointment,"Martha, Martha, Martha! I thought you were on par with your brother, but I guess I was mistaken! I am fascinated and enamored with Rufus and his repertoire, so naturally, I was willing to give Martha a good ""college try"". Well, I found this music to be boring and the lyrics just not ""there"". This one's going to Goodwill. There is MAYBE one song that I would listen to again, that might grow on me over time and make it into my ""rotation"". But Rufus has something indescribable, for me, that Martha just ""ain't got"". I think she should stick to being backup for her brother, as their voices blend beautifully. Martha, hat's off to you for trying to find your own voice, but you should cede the crown to your brother!"
3,a good debut,"this is a strong debut. martha wainwright has a rich, resonant voice and there are some truly gorgeous melodies on this album. as a lyricist, wainwright is a bit hit and miss; she hasn't acquired real subtlety yet and there are a couple of cringe-inducing clunkers, but I'm prepared to overlook it because there's a compelling earthiness and emotional honesty here. you get the feeling wainwright is going to turn into something very special, but isn't quite there yet. in the meantime, this is a really good album, and a very consoling listen if you're twenty something and not sure what on earth you're doing with your life."
4,3.5 stars,"Maybe I'm just inclined to enjoy Martha (I'm a huge fan of her family, especially Rufus), but I think her voice is really strong and unique. Her songwriting ability on the other hand... well, let's just say that I never realize how important lyrics are to me until I find an artist who writes silly, rambling ones. Oh well, the sound quality is great, Martha's voice is a joy to listen to, and as long and you don't think too much about what she's actually saying it's quite enjoyable. Standout tracks are the heartfelt B.M.F.A., Whither Must I wander, and Who was I kidding? These songs have simpler instrumentals and less cheesy backup vocalizing, showcasing Martha's voice to its best advantage. All in all it's a somewhat mixed bag, but worth checking out."
1,Not much of a tribute...,"This ""tribute"" is not only disappointing, but rather repulsive. The most unremitting torch of Gram Parson's music and legend was and remains Emmylou Harris, who was not only absent, but unmentioned throughout the video, even in the introduction. This instead was the Polly Parsons show, Gram's biological daughter, who declares that all she can think about during the encore is that she was not wearing any panties while dancing on stage...a true mark of respect and intent. If you are interested in a true tribute, purchase the CD, Return of the Grievous Angel."
3,Horrible Mix,"Ever listen to a live show when they forget to turn on the singer's mic and he sounds like he's singing off stage? Bingo! They didn't bother to master the audio!?!Nobody else mentioned this fault but I found this to be so glaringly obvious that this DVD needs to be remastered and reissued or Gram's ghost to coming back to get the engineers.I gave it 3 stars because most of the performances are really good and, of course, it is Gram's music. Rent it. Don't buy it."
2,Should have been better,"with a little work this could have been better. The sound is off, the lighting is poor. There is a reason a cd wasnt released to this junk. Rent it. Don't buy it. I am returning my copy to Amazon. This is the first product I have ever returned and I have been a regular customer since 1999."
3,A mixed bag,"This concert has several highlights and those performances are really good. Perhaps because Gram's music was primarily rock and the interest was in how he fused this with country that I was expecting more country performances. The outstanding respect that these performers show for Gram's music is evident. I especially enjoyed the paring of ""Keef"" with Norah Jones."
5,A great concert,"The folks who had reservations and/or strong criticisms of this DVD, especially of Susan Marshall's performances, should just defrost their hearts. Everyone involved in the DVD played and sang their hearts out. Some of the performances were extraordinary for sure: Al Perkins' steel on every song, James Burton's Tele playing, Raul Malos' singing and the manic but totally appropriate lead playing of Dwight Yoakam's guitar player to name a few. All the ""big stars"" rose to the occaision. The concert rocked from the first note to the last. What more do ya want if you love Gram Parsons?"
5,Untochable!!!!!,"i am 64 and still enjoy my walk down memory lane.I discovered Gram and most of my friends thought I had gone country western. Now they know better and like myself have found a diamond. You should listen to this unique group of friend say ""Thanks"" in there awesome way. ENJOY"
1,GP Defiled,"Why no Emmylou Harris & Chris Hillman? This ""Tribute"" DVD is overblown crap, including the worst of Grams' legacy. Some involved remind me of the hangers on and losers who would bring him down to their level and eventually down to his early death. Shame on the producers of this trash -he deserves better (apologies to Dwight, Lucinda, & Steve).Do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy of ""Gilded Palace of Sin"" & ""Grievous Angel"" instead."
5,Weiner Whiners,"I loved this show. Of course you can't make everyone happy...Lucinda Williams gave a heart felt rendition of ""A Song for You""They honored Gram thats enough. Only 27 and a legend (Peace)"
5,Keith is GOD!,Lay of Keith Richards. He's absolutely fantastic during this show. Anybody who thinks otherwise needs their head examined!
5,Improves each time,"Our grandchildren are enjoying this book, more with each reading. At first I was not overly impressed with it, but as I see how much these preschoolers enjoy the artwork as well as the story, I am enjoying it more too. The artwork is so expressive showing the feelings of the little cub. The story is very sweet. You have a lot to ""discuss"" while reading to a very young child."
5,Just charming,"When you need to put your little tiger to sleep this should do the trick. Beautiful, fanciful, gentle yet fierce illustrations..."
4,"Sexy, Steamy, and Hot!","Wow! What a sexy story! Very romantically presented with excellent characterizations. Vicki Lewis Thompson knows how to write tantillizing stories! I was mesmerized and couldn't put the book down until I got to the end!Unfortunately, when Charlie discovered Mark's secret, instead of confronting him with it, she devised an elaborate scheme to test him. The way Mark ultimately regained Charlie's trust was highly irresponsible. This immature and childish game-playing turned me off and distracted from the fun and sexiness of the story. It would have been more realistic and would have sent a better message to have the conflict resolved through open communication and honesty. I was glad for the redeeming ending!"
3,I have actually read the book and I'm not a relative.,"This book is definitely worth reading. It is solidly based in reality, which at times makes for tedious reading (especially in the middle). All of the characters are standard stereotypes of ""city people"". The poor mother who sacrifices all, the absentee institutionalized father, the son who is an overachiever despite living on welfare and the rebellious son. Mary and her ex-husband, arguably the most interesting characters aren't explored in any depth. Still it captivated the interest of this jaded New Yorker who had heard the story of ""the poor fatherless kid who made it"" in its many forms, numerous times."
3,book,Fine book if I remember well since it has been a bit that I read it but I recall liking it and reading it enthusiastically. Guess I would recommend it to others.
4,THANKS FOR THE MEMORY,"I READ THIS BOOK IN ONE WEEK END WHILE VISITING MY DAUGHTER. IT WAS A DELITE FOR ME . ALTHOUGH RAISED IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO , AND BEING FEMALE, THE TIME PERIOD MATCHED AND SO DID THE FELLOWS THAT GREW UP IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. WE WERE EITHER IRISH, ITALIAN OR JEWISH. HE REALLY TAKES ONE INSIDE THIS LITTLE FELLOW AND WOULD CERTAINLY GIVE ANY MOTHER WITH A REBEL SON HOPE. I LOVED IT!"
2,Barbie Nutcracker Craze Coloring Book,"If your daughter is into the Barbie Nutrcracker craze, she will enjoy this coloring book although I felt it was a bit expensive for a coloring book. My 4 year old daughter was very happy for it and rushed off to start drawing in it. It's a nice extra gift if you are giving a young girl the Barbie Nutcracker Video (5 stars!!!) or any of the Barbie Nutcracker dolls, also sold at Amazon.com. As always, Amazon.com is still the best way to shop, especially for the working mother."
4,A movie this should be!,"I work in the jewelry district (47th Street). It's tough and hectic, so when I get off work, I like to read escapist fiction. I bought this little science fiction novel, and was simply amazed at the author's grasp of both science and emerging geo-political trends. Everything Dickson writes about in ""Europa"" has a high probability of coming true: from his theoretial Martian colonies to discovery of undersea life on Europa and his prediction of the rise of three major geopolitical power blocs in the late 21st Century: the United States of the Northern Hemisphere (USNH), the Pacific Alliance (PACAL) and the Confederated States of the Southern Hemisphere (CSSH). But what I really liked was how Dickson hypothesizes humanity will emerge from the straitjacket of mumbo-jumbo religious dogma to a more evolved and sensible view of our place in the cosmos."
4,Great comprehensive book,"First of all this is a textbook and it reads like a textbook. If you're looking for a book that makes things easy and has just the highlights this might not be the book for you. If you're looking for a book that's a primer on motivation and motivation theory it's a great book. Especially valuable in a large number of references to prior research. The authors do a great job of explaining the basics, current theories, strengths of and arguments against these theories."
3,little disappointed,i was a little disappointed in this purchase. the book had a lot of highlighting in it and there was no mention of highlighting when i purchased it. otherwise the book is in good condition.
1,hated it!!!!!!!,rv having fun yet is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better!!!!! i turly thing that if u r over 8 u will not find this good
2,Missing Peices,"This one was fine, but incomplete. It missed a whole set of beefs including Eminem versus Benzino! That was a full segment. it cut alot of the Roxanne Shante stuff too. Maybe the first time I saw this it was an unedited version, but that version was a great continuation of the first one. I think Ving Rhames was still narrating the one I saw too. Meh, is what I'm summing this version up as."
3,Even stars have beef....,"If ya wanna see who does and doesn't, watch this. Chances are you will learn something new."
2,Gosh,they just need to make a thoro job then it would be ill and qd3 has yet to fully cover nas and jayz more effort needed if theres a beef three
3,It's ok,"This isn't as good as the first one but you still get some pretty good battles. The best one in my opinion is cypress hill vs. westside connection. Man that beef was vicious. Most of this dvd is about how bussines can turn former friends into bitter rivalries. You also see the roxanne battle, ice cube vs priority records, nelly vs. krs one and others. Well if you can find it at a video store and rent it first or find someone who has it and see it first before you buy it."
5,IT WAZ DA $HIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Think this beef was less talk than the first one.Plus what i liked bout dis one iz, it was more onconflicts than just about talk. I liked the bonus beefs andalot of the beefs in da movie.MOVIE BEEFS""KRS 1""-VS-""NELLY""-Krs Killed nelly,nelly iz a slut!""WESTSIDE CONNECTION""-VS-""CYPRESS HILL""-SquashedBONUS""Grandmaster Caz""-VS-""Big Bank Hank""-fUNNY""ICP""-VS-""Eminem""-ICP Deserved more attention""KRS 1""-VS-""P.M. DAWN""-The Best on the bonus"
2,Qd3's weakest effort yet,"QD3 has put out some good product before but thid dvd is kind of weak. The Roxanne battles, EPMD, KRS&Nelly;, Canibus&LL;, And Ice Cube vs Cyprus Hill was dope but the DVD feels incomplete. The Grandmaster Caz vs. The SugarHill Gang beef that can be found in the extras should have been in the main movie. I would love to hear Big Ban Hank try to refute what Caz says. The Royce/D12 beef was obviously a replacement for the eminem/source beef and word is the source punked them out of using the footage.Buy this used or at a discount but it's not worth the full price"
4,What's beef?,"Giving it 4 stars because the more Beef dvd's they release, the less appealing they become. First one gets 5 stars, second one gets 4 and....well...u get the point."
2,terrible,"Maybe this book got better after the first half, but I couldn't get past it. This book is badly written, uninteresting and has no structure. I read this because it was recommended for a book club discussion, and I don't think anyone else could get through it either. If she was a better writer I would have been more interested in her journey, but she just doesn't have the gift of keeping her reader interested."
2,For those with an appetite for snobbery,"I could not finish the book because I felt as if I could not relate to her snobbery. Her life of privilege. I was only able to seriously read the first fifty pages then skimmed through it to be enlightened as many others seem to have been. I was not able to feel any of the emotions she professed to have, smell or taste any of her food and ultimately, was not moved by her writing. Could I have just been in a bad mood?"
5,Better quality than OEM Motorcraft O2sensor it replaced,"I had many options when considering a replacement for my 1997 Ford Ranger 2.3L 4cylinder motor. I chose the (Nippo)Denso product due to the price and previous experience with their products. Quality is great! Included anti-seize compound saving me from having to buy a tube.You'll need an O2sensor removal socket (or wrench) and maybe some penetrating lube as the old sensor usually seizes itself to the bung over time. Took less than 5minutes and after clearing trouble code ""CEL (check engine light)"" my truck runs better and smoother."
5,wonderful series,This whole series is just great. From This Other Eden to Eden and Honor. Great seriesAnd then there is Lost and Found wonderfulThis lady knows how to write
3,Not impressed,"This book was very well written, but gosh, the hero seemed like a cowardly imbecile most (3/4) of the book. The heroine was written well. It was not believable how these two finally came together. This is not a book for the avid romance reader. This reads like the romantic Victoria Holt without the mystery. I can read a book very quickly, this one took me over a week to read. After reading the reviews, I thought it would be better than it was, kind of disappointed."
4,Excellent Service,"I ordered 4 books of the series, and each of them came very fast. I was very satisfied with the quality of the books."
5,High quality tools,"I already owned two portable, battery powered drills when I purchased this set because I wanted the cordless sawzall. Not only am I pleased with the cordless sawzall, but the cordless drill is the best one I own. It is much higher quality than the two Porter-Cable drills I own. I use the drill/hammer function frequently as I have a stone house and require a serious drill to hang anything on any of the exterior facing walls of my house. By buying the package you also get two batteries which is helpful for completing jobs by charging one battery while working with the other."
1,Just plain boring,You get nothing really out on this cd. Nothing great on here. Not very happy about this cd at all it sucks all the way. But ther first one was great get that not this crap.
2,Still Suffering is much better,"I was highly anticipating this album when it came out. It has it's moments (2 tracks) but overall I was very dissapointed. Still Suffering was great and it still is but ""Numb"" lacked everything Still Suffering offered. It's actually hard to believe that this is Klank. Anyways get Still Suffering instead of Numb."
1,twisted facts,"Chapter ""War breaks out"" is a total failure in presenting history right.It says that polish cavalry attacked german tanks, and that is why Poland lost the war. Funny??? Is it?The fact is that it never happened.The author gets it from the polish movie ""Lotna"" where such an allegory was used to depict crushing might of the Hitler's army.The director's intention was to show that resistance against such a power was futile.Polish army did not have any kamikaze troops like that.Twisted look at the history. I can elaborate on other chapters, but it is a waste of time.What is the purpose of such a stupid propaganda?Except of the nice cover there is not much worth reading."
5,The greatest mix of the worlds greatest reggea artists.,This has got to be the baddest cd I have ever heard.
4,Excellent Movie,"Aan Milo Sajna was directed by Mukul Dutt in the year 1970. he movie stars Rajesh Khanna, Asha Parekh, Vinod Khanna, Rajindranath, Aruna Irani and Nirupa Roy. ""Aan Milo Sajna"" is a movie about weird people, most of whom are either funny or frightening depending on your disposition. I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately trying to figure out if I'd find Varsha (Asha Parekh's character) charming if I met her, or if I'd just want to deck her. The thing about Varsha is if you DID plan on decking her, she'd probably deck you first, and that's one reason everybody in the film loves her so darn much.So, its up to you how you judge. The film was above average at Box Office.Music of the movie is given by Laxmikant Pyarelal duet."
5,Excellent tool!,This tool is a must have for your kitchen. It's perfect for omelet making and the fact that there is no head to come off a handle is great!! This item will last a long time. I love mine!
5,wonderful San Francisco,"Great secondhand cast : Leslie Nielsen, Richard Bull (lhotp), Burr Debening and Katherine Cannon (father murphy)Great cars of the seventies, splendid views of ""the town""Don't miss the streets..."
2,Not as seasons 1 and 2,No spanish language nor spanish subtitles as seasons 1 and 2 do. A stop thing for a lot of people. It must be said before purchasing
3,SLUDGE FANS TAKE NOTE.,"For anyone who is a sludgecore fan(eyehategod,cavity,buzzov.en,iron monkey,sleep)this cd is for you.The cd is a bit long(74 minutes)but it's well worth it.It's slow and heavy and can really rock out."
4,It's a very good pick!,"I loved it, simply because Sarah Turnbull captivates the reality of so many people who end up living in another country and even though they start a new life, with new people and new meaning around them, is never quite the same... You find yourself in the new place wishing you were somewhere else, and when you return to your country you wish you were back in the other one. It explains the struggle of culture integration and the differences that may seem to drive you crazy, but in the end those things become part of your every day life. The book inspired me to make the best out of my personal situation, I felt so identified with her and so encouraged to embrace who I am and at the same time embrace my new life in another country. I loved it!"
3,Taking you beyond the common tourist,"Sarah captures the French personality and traits in a personal journey whilst she is trying to blend into a new life. French mannerisms, style and habits are not rude just different. Sarah learns to accept that she is an Australian living in France and will never become French. The book takes you through her travel to discovery. Sarah has opened the country of France to reveal its wonders and quirks woven amongst her daily life and unfolding love."
4,Could Not Put the Book Down,"Trumbell's witty account of adapting to life in Paris in Almost French, Love and a New Life in Paris is a wonderful read. Her portrait of Parisians is remarkably humouring, from snobby shopkeepers, uptight cocktail parties and unrelenting remarks and ""eyeballs"" on her dress, speech and mannerisms-Trumbell's account of living and adjusting to societal demands and attitudes is utterly fascinating. The book is more travel and experience oriented rather than finding love with her boyfriend, `Fred'-and while I longed for that element to surface at any moment-I grew fond of her reactions and struggles in Paris. Great read, romantic, good history, well developed story."
3,Almost...,"While readable and has enjoyable moments, I find the book to be lacking in several parts. She often describes her feelings more than she describes the scene and often gradually builds to a story that she fails to tell. For example, she writes at length about how much she couldn't wait for her childhood friend to visit her then the entire visit is condensed into one dinner of which we only get one quip about a miscommunication. In trying to cover everything about moving to Paris, the author dilutes everything--spreads it too thin. (Before reading this book, I read Lunch in Paris, in which each chapter carefully remembers an important moment. While I didn't get every story she has to tell, the anecdotes told provided an excellent understanding of the author but also of Paris, France, and their people.)"
3,almost,"So many areas call for better editing: fashion and dogs were endless. Very uneven manner of expression which, had it been written in French would be judged too ordinary; ie construction and syntax lower the class of the whole. Yet, as in even ordinary journalism, among the facts there are lovely moments nicely expressed."
3,a mixed bag,"The writer is at her best when she's describing Paris and at her worst when she's whining about how the French are so, well, French. Probably the least self-aware personal account of anything I've ever read."
2,Are all Ausses this whiny?,"Expecting a romance type story, it's needless to say I was somewhat disappointed that it did not go too much into the relationship. I was even more put-off with her constant whining about things that did not go exactly how she pictured.There are so many unanswered questions that I wondered if she bothered making a seconded drafted of her story.There is too much whining and too little about the people around her, especially about Fredrick. I think she expected too much and did not give enough of herself. True, there are some funny moments, but to put it bluntly, I'm glad I only checked this out of the library instead if buying it like I was intending to."
3,Almost Good,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. I assumed it was going to have a little more tale of the love between the author and her Frenchman and a little bit less whining about not fitting in in France. I know it must be hard being an outsider, but it was just a bit much, so much that I wondered why she stuck through all the turmoil...I assume it was because she loved her man, but it surely didn't depict much of that in this book."
5,A Book That Will Stay With You For Years To Come,"I read this book a few years ago and it became a fast favorite to pick up again and again. I even find myself thinking of her story at odd times, as I have made multiple cross-continental moves around the world. Turnbull captures all the essentials of moving to Paris from the perspective of an Australian journalist (complete with super casual shorts and sandals when she arrives at the airport, amidst a whirlwind of fashionable heals around her). In no other book have I found as frank an explanation for European women and their attitudes towards ""foreigners"", or just other women! It was perfect and she hit the nail right on the head on multiple occasions, including her being rude back to a baker - henceforth earning his eternal respect. I love this book and I love this writer. Can't wait to read more!"
3,A Glimpse Within The Mansard Homes of Paris,"This novel started a bit slow for me, but I soon got into the rhythm of Paris and enjoyed it. Her descriptions of the people of Paris were spot on and while they were sometimes exasperating, they were always true to themselves and their image of what 'outsiders' think of Parisiennes. A good armchair travelogue of Paris Life through the eyes of an Aussie."
4,Entertaining light read,"If you've ever dreamed of spending more than a week in Paris with the hope of getting to know the natives a just weee bit, this book will introduce you to the lesser known cultural values of the French. The author humorously describes her sometimes awkward, sometimes humiliating experiences and in the end, finally figures it all out...well more or less."
4,took it to Paris and loved it,"I bought this for a trip to Paris. It seemed like an interesting true story, and I enjoy reading books set in the locations I am traveling in. I was pleasantly surprised by this. I felt like it really helped me understand French culture a little better. As an American who speaks only the amount of French learned from Pimsleur's first level of language CDs, I was really nervous about going to Paris as the reputation of Parisians is that they are really snobby. This book was great because it was written by a backpacker who visits Paris and ends up staying there. Her experiences with Paris and Parisians helped me understand a different perspective on locals seeming snobby or why everyone had dogs. I'm sure someone who is a native French-person or has lived in Paris for decades might find the viewpoint simplistic, but I found it enlightening and entertaining at the same time. A perfect read for a trip to Paris."
2,Delightful,"The book is interesting and delightful. The scope, probably due to the narrative focus, is very limited. The book will be better if the author describes her experience in other parts of France."
4,paris assimilation,"This is an interesting perspective in assimilation into a fairly closed culture that include the difficulties and frustrations of attempts of entry into life in a large foreign city. I would recommend this not as a model, for other foreign cities have their own personalities, but as a preparation for issues that one may encounter. There is a romanticism of living abroad, but that may need to be tempered with a little realism and I believe that Almost French: Love and a New Life In Paris provides some a foreigner's insight into particularly this fairly closed culture upon arrival. I enjoyed this portrayal a great deal and would recommend reading it to both travelers and armchair travelers as well."
3,Australian writer finds love and navigates a new culture.,"I had just finished a number of fast-paced reads and found it hard to get into the slower pace of this book. I'm glad I did and enjoyed the author's various stories about Paris and France. I learned a lot about French culture in a personal voice. At first, I had a difficult time getting a clear picture of Frederic and what the circumstance of their meeting was and what inspired her strong feelings etc. (Feeling strong enough to relocate to France.) It wasn't until the move into central Paris that I saw Frederic as a living breathing person. I give the book 3 stars because I feel something missing--that feeling one gets when many ""ah-ha"" moments are acheived in a book. I did not experience that kind of satisfaction upon finishing it."
3,It is a good insight but slow pace book.,"It was a good insite on French culture and adjusting to a major change. It was a slow paced book, not a lot of adventure, just a lot of analyzing."
3,An informative view of life in Paris that lacks spice,"An informative read but the writer gives a very bland, sanitized version of her experiences leaving out the juicy romantic details of what it is like to be in the most romantic city in the world in a romantic relationship with a frenchman. The story goes from their first meeting, to her arrival in Paris straight to spending a week together in the french countryside without ever mentioning a word about how their romance and subsequent relationship blossomed. Perhaps the writer might say this is because the french are private about such matters, in spite of their love of sexually charged ""witticisms"" but frankly, the audience of the book is clearly Australian, English and American, all of which would be interested in such information. Informative and insightful in some aspects and disappointing in others."
2,incorrectly titled... there is no love nor new life in this snooze,"As of today, 07/24/2012 there are over 45 five star reviews for this novel. The author must have alot of family and friends registered on Amazon, because I really, really don't get it. There is no love story to be had; and yes, the one and two star reviews are right- why is Frederic, an alluring and charming Frenchman, with this unsophisticated, whining, (unattractive, even by the author's subtle descriptions) foreigner? I just don't get it. Not a good way to be introduced to the French culture. And not even an entertaining love story to read during lunch break. Chuck this one."
4,"Wonderful read, but a little irritating at times","I flew through this like a box of peanut butter M & M's! It certainly rang true and was witty, entertaining and romantic, (It would make a somewhat entertaining movie, too) Although Sarah tends (in my opinion) to whine a bit, ""I don't actually *live* in Paris, i'm two metro stops away, oh noo! Tragedy!"" I can understand her puzzlement and anger, but I think she should have considered herself damn lucky she had a well established, wel-to-do French boyfriend. Some Australian women who go to live in Paris don't have anyone to support them, spend money on them or let them live in modern spacious apartments. Apart from this, ""Almost French"" is a very good read. Read it on your way to Paris on that long flight."
4,completely believable,nice story with totally true bits (such as the French not knowing how to queue) and entertaining bits (tiens un con dans une boulangerie!).
4,A quick summer read.,"I picked this book up on a whim and breezed through it over a portion of a weekend. It's cute, and at times painful, touching and enlightening both about the French and (less so) about Australians, but always about how vitally different and difficult to understand another culture can be.I did find it odd that there was little to no detail about how the relationship between Sarah and Frederick progressed. I wasn't expecting lurid details -- but a basic acknowledgement seemed glarigly missing, and at times that made it difficult for me to really get absorbed because there was this key element that was left dark.But otherwise, an interesting insight into culture clash. Like other reviewers have said, it gave me a few reasons to pause and reflect on how I might improve my own personal style by making some adjustments. Interesting."
1,Written by an idiot,"This is an awful book, written by an idiot television presenter, about her romance with an obnoxious and jingoistic Frenchman with zero social skills. I had my doubts at page five, hated their guts by page fifteen, and finally gave up midway at about page 120. It is a leaden chronicle of life in the City of Light, with the apparent goal of making anyone hate it."
2,Crushed? More like total slush...,"So, I previously purchased the ""chunk"" version of this product [Native Forest Organic Pineapple Chunks, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)] since I love pineapple, and they were delicious. The chunks were of a nice size, and even my cat kept bothering me when I ate them, as he apparently liked the sweetness of them.Then I saw this version, labeled as ""crushed."" The picture basically makes it look just like smaller chunks than the ""chunk"" version. But it's not. Instead, it's like this awful kind of sludge or mush, and for some reason it comes from a different country than the ""crushed"" version, and doesn't taste as good.In my opinion, stay away from ""crushed"" and go for the ""chunk"" version. I've also now ordered the ""mini rings"" variety to see how those are."
3,Not Bad,"I read Linwood Barclay's first novel, BAD MOVE, and I liked it. Though it started off slow, it was quite funny and well written.Bad Guys maintained a steady jogger's pace from the beginning, but I'd hardly call it a page turner, and it wasn't that funny.All in all, BAD GUYS was just barely good enough to get me to buy his next novel in the series, LONE WOLF."
5,Bad Guys,Just found this author and very much enjoy his writing. The only thing I'm not fond of is the liberal use of profanity by the characters. The story line would be just as enjoyable if it wasn't used. The plots are well constructed and holds your interest right to the finish.
3,Good Mystery Novel,"Not as funny as ""Bad Move"", but worth reading. I've read all of the Zach Walker novels and enjoyed them all."
3,"Bad Guys suffers from sequel syndrome and a ""Bad Ending""","Having read and liked Linwood Barclay's first book Bad Move, i decided to go right into this book. However, I was kinda disappointed with this one. Started off fairly promising but the ending was just, well, ""Bad"", imo.Also, I realize Barclay has to take some poetic license to help sell his book, but I didn't really care for the way he has the two teenagers cursing so much in front of their parents. If I'd done that in front of MY parents, some 25 years ago when I was 16, I'd probably still be grounded to this very day."
3,It's A Mediocre CD!,"It's a mediocre CD, there were a lot of songs I wanted that were not on the CD! Because it’s so old and not a lot were made, I couldn’t find a song list for the CD so I purchased it anyway! The songs are ok, but I had to go purchase other CD’s to get the songs I really wanted. By the way, purchasing MP3’s or FLAC are missing sounds that CD’s still have."
3,"I'm a Derek Ford porno chic admirer, so what? well ...","I'm a Derek Ford admirer. So what? Well ...no need to say more, really, if you know not of what I write butif you have seen other Derek Ford stuffyou may be a little disappointed but, though there is no Heather Deeley,this is pure porno chic... bizarre porno chic"
3,K. Alexi is the only reason to get this...,"Disc 1 by Robert Armani: he knows how to mix, but I never quite dug his production style (reminds me too much of Frankie Bones), Disc 2 by Gene Hunt: his productions are mediocre and the mixing is worse (he's trying to be like those Tresor guys), Disc 3 by K. Alexi Shelby: starts off a little slow then builds up to nice party vibe, he's a decent producer and Dj (mixes House w/ a HIP-Hop cut & scratch style). I would've rated this a 1 if is wasn't for cd 3..."
5,classic New York hardcore,"The Cro-Mags ""age of quarrel"" is an all time classic as far as hardcore goes. They were the first hardcore band I ever saw live (on the ""Age of Quarrel"" tour) and have been one of my favorites since then. They have a classic hardcore sound which pretty much defines NY-HC. Age of quarrel is by far their best and a ""must have"" for any hardcore fan."
4,SPLAT !!! SPLAT!!!!SPLAT!!!!!,"YES ! THIS ALBUM "" BEST WISHES "" KILLS. WE ALWAYS LISTENED TO AGE OF QUARREL WHILE EVERYONE GOT IN THEIR POSITIONS FOR A FREE FOR ALL KILLJOY ! THE SPRING OF 1989 WAS A THRASHING TIME AND ME AND SOME FRIENDS GOT INTO PAINTBALL. A HURTFUL SPORT THAT LETS OUT SOME AGGRESSION. WE WOULD PUT THE SPEAKERS ON TOP OF THE VAN, CRANK UP THE BASE AND PUT THE TREB. AT 6 AND POP IN CRO MAGS BEST WISHES TAPE AND WOULD PLAY AGE OF QUARREL. ONCE THE SONG WAS OVER WE WOULD DESTROY EACH OTHER IN A PAINFUL EVENT ""SHIRTLESS"" . THIS BAND WOULD PUMP YOU UP WHILE YOU WERE DECIDING WHO TO KICKASS ON FIRST. GREAT BAND AND ALBUM. NO PAIN, NO FUN."
1,"The bladder is weak, but my spirit is dry","If you close your eyes and are bombarded by images of Muppet characters singing the songs that are unwinding on the disc you are playing, and you did not happen to purchase a Jim Henson CD, there is a good possibility you are either being duped or you are loitering in Idiotland. The latter seems to be the case here, as this came out in 1986, way before metal developed a sense of humor. In fact, I am time-traveling this review back from the year 2249, and Metallica Act IX still thinks the wah-wah pedal is the equivalent of a Schopenhauer lecture. But I regress.Which brings me to my actual point: I try not to encourage homeless people who just so happen to have a good pair of pipes. It tends to keep me up at night. And, of course, it doesn't necessarily mean they should be showered with precious coins. Just ask David Yow. When asked if he thought it was a compliment to be told he had a one-of-a-kind vocal style, to his credit, he responded: ""Thank god!"""
5,"CPA Profession, The: Opportunities, Responsibilities, and Se","As a high school senior I had to do a paper about a profession, I chose accounting, this book not only gave me all of the information I was looking for, but it has also encouraged me to go into this profession even more. I highly recomend this book to any person even thinking about this profession."
3,A Good Read,I found this book to be very enlightening. It gives a glimpse into the workings of American Politics. Especially now with the elections coming up. It's good to know where this process came from and how it evolved over time.
3,Capital Forming Effects of Military Mobilization,"My contention is that Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions, predicated upon wealth (especially inherited wealth)."
2,Too confusing for Beginners... Flimsy Book!,"I am a beginner Tarot reader. I bought this set because I thought that it would be very complete. It came with cards, book, and a ""cloth."" I was wrong! The book is confusing, and it has alot of information that is not necessary for Tarot readings. The book literally fell apart 5 hours after I bought it. Someone who knows more about the meanings of cards may have better luck. Don't count on using the book after a few hours!"
2,Pretty cards but there are problems,"Yes, the cards are quite appealing to the eye. This is the reason I purchased them. And the cloth is a nice touch. But the book is shoddy...the cover fell off the day I purchased it. I was so disappointed! On top of that, you can tell when a card is inversed - and there's no mention made as to the symbolism of a card should it happen to fall into that ""upside-down"" position. Overall,I wouldn't spend my money on this deck if I were you."
3,"Easy to Learn, Easy to Bend","This was the first tarot deck I worked with, over 18 years ago. As a student of Greek myth I found them easy to learn - every card in the major arcana relates to a figure from Greek myth, and each of the four suits follows a myth from beginning to end. Even if you are not initially familiar with the myths, learning the cards in this ""story"" format will likely help you remember their individual significance. The accompanying book is well-written and engaging, and serves as both a guide to this deck specifically as well as a general tarot tutorial.I only rate this deck/book set ""3 stars"" because they are so poorly produced, as many other reviewers point out. My first Mythic Tarot deck was made from much thicker stock; obviously the publisher has cut corners with this new edition."
1,Very Unhappy,The Tarot Deck itself was missing the Death Card it had two of the The Hanged Man Card. The quality of material used for the cards were very thin. Very disappointed with overall quality of the deck. I'm in the process of returning this purchase and I just recived it this afternoon in the mail.
3,too drawn out,"simply put, the movie takes too long to get to the point & to the scary parts. the long wait is only slightly worth it. u can easily tell it was a short story lengthened to fill out an entire movie & there wasnt enuf material."
2,great story,Love Costner's movies cause he goes with a lot of original story lines. This one does also and i loved it all the way but it chokes in the end. I'm guessing they were going for shock value which they all ready had. They could have did a great hero's ending but they f*****d it all up . I wonder why cause i was on the edge of my seat tell the end and then I almost threw my remote.
1,Don't bother!,This movie was horrible. It initially had some potential but was ruined by a lack of ending. It's like the film company just ran out of money and stopped filming right in the middle of the climax. Don't waist your time or money.
2,Its Ok,"I wanted to see this movie . The price was not bad and it gave me something to watch on my free time, the beginning was ok , the ending could use improvement. Nothing more to say"
3,B S,I'm so tired of the adult being the child and the child being the adult. I would have put this girl in a hospital long before the bad stuff ever happens in this movie.
3,DADDY'S DANGEROUS GIRL,PROS:*Moody and ominous atmosphere*Overall good performances including Kevin Costner's understated performance*Good allegory on father's fear of raising children and child's fear of losing their parents*Creature effects pretty spookyCONS:*Father's actions are pretty ridiculous*Nebulous and unsatisfying ending*Stop killing cats--dogs get treated better!SUMMARY:Enjoyable and different thriller.
3,"Not bad, expected alot worse","Well not expecting much from this movie, I was pleasantly surpised. Popped it in the blu ray, turned all the lightsoff in the home theatre and I became quite drawn in to this movie.The film maintains an eerie feel through out and definitely follows the "" less you see, more you imagine"" theme to it which I liked.Would I buy this movie ? No...But felt it justified the rental $$.At the end of the day a movie is supposed to entertain and this did.Cheers"
2,Poor editing and unusual ending don't leave much room.,"Kevin Costner gets some good practice playing the disconnected parent in this movie but that's about the only good part. The editors did a poor job with the result that the viewer feels ""how did we get here?"" quite often. The ending is not expected and you have to sit with it for a while to come to any kind of understanding of its origin. ""I'll never leave you, "" Costner's character swears, in a touching bedtime moment. The character's choice was not an easy one and the viewer ends up feeling that he made the wrong choice by leaving his little boy alone and choosing to share his new daughter's fate."
1,Turkey,This was the worst film I have seen this year. Correction. It's the worst film I have seen in 10 years. I jokingly said at the beginning when the first sinister stirrings were taking place that there was probably a native American burial mound involved. Bingo! I implore you not to watch this execrable nonsense. No-one but Costner has the slightest idea how to act. The monsters are more funny than frightening. The script is a cringe inducing embarrassment. I could go on. And on.
1,Please bring back the old horror movies,This movie did not make me jump once. I was waiting to be scared out of my mind.....but nothing happened. It was borining from beggining to end *Yawn* nice try.........
3,"Stars for the kids and design, not for the story","The two kid actors here deserve credit for doing a decent job, and so does the production designer.Some spoilers coming....The story, however, is ploddingly paced, Costner doesn't do a good job of looking scared--he looks merely tired and nervous; the story about the mound, the queen, and so on is not explained or clarified well; the ending is confusing; and it makes no sense at all that a father would abandon his kids the way the father does towards the end, considering how worried he was about them prior to that.It could have been better."
3,Not as bad as some reviewers would have you believe,"After reading other reviews here I was expecting to eject the thing 10 minutes into it. The story did have some holes - one that drove me crazy was when he saw a bunch of bugs in a drawer. I would have thought the next scene was getting an exterminator. They just skipped over it as though it never happened.All that aside, this was rather and creepy with good special effects. It had some memorable creatures too."
2,Not up to his past level of craft,"This was a disappointment. Although well produced, the songs do not hold together. They musically ramble with nothing to hang on to. I love this artist's prior work for the most part, but these songs were not up to his past standards. He seems to be trying too hard to be complex and the songs therefore do not sit well."
5,drive thru's next big thing,"this cd makes it clear that hidden in plain view is the next big thing for drive thru records. hidden in plain view is an outstanding new band with a great lead singer in joe reo. in this cd they show a variety of different sound; each song is unique and a different style.shamans witches magic- one of the best songs on the ep, it reminds me alot of the fast paced songs by Brand Newthe chaser- yet another good song. i love this song it has great guitar riffs near the choruswhere the highways end- this, again, shows hipv's versitility. its completely different from the rest of the ep, and its awesomebelly full of kerosene- my favorite song on the ep. the drums throughout the song are awesome and joe reo really shows his voice in this.20 below- the only song on this ep that will be on the full length, and its deserving of it. again something different from hipv and more brillianceall i can say is get this cd and the full length is out february 22 get that too!"
1,This band has not found its comfortable sound.,"Hidden in Plain View hasn't been able to find a sound with this record. It screams ""awkward"" from start to finish, and the songwriting seems to actually be on the decline compared to the Find E.P. and Operation: Cut-throat. The single curious exception to this rule is the oddly precocious, mature ""20 Below"", which offers the listener a glimpse of hope for the full-length. I loved this band before this E.P., and I'm sure they'll redeem themselves with the upcoming full-length? Maybe?"
3,Jackie Chan can act!,"This is not your typical Jackie Chan movie. No comedy here, and the action pieces are not the wild everyting-plus-the-kitchen-sink brawling you'd expect. Still, there are some very exciting moments, and some good stunts in this one, plus a little more of a plot than you usually get with Chan. The big thing is, though, this film proves Jackie really is a fine actor, and when he gets too old for Kung Fu, he has a career as an actor to fall back on! (Not to mention director, choreographer, producer, etc.)"
5,Jackie Chan - no jokes,"Crime Story tends to be overshadowed by the Police Story films, but it's a very different animal: while it may share a few familiar faces, it's a straight-up thriller without the need for much comic relief and with a strong dramatic turn from Chan. Focussing on a kidnapping carried out by corrupt cops who figure they can keep the investigation off track, it's not short on action, but like the similarly comparatively lesser know Thunderbolt this time the violence is played rather more for real - when the punches land, they hurt. It's a shame Chan never followed it up with more dramatic roles, but it certainly stands up as one of his most memorable pictures."
2,NOT A REAL JACKIE CHAN MOVIE,"This movie doesn't really star Jackie Chan. He is only shoved in in an unrelated clip so as to fool people into buying it. Otherwise, it is only marginably entertaining."
3,Too Much Acting.,"This is one of Jackie's ""acting"" movies.I think that Jackie can act but I want to see more fights and stunts from him.This one does have a good plot.I did keep watching but I wouldn't want anyone to watch unless they were fans like I am."
3,"I LIKED THE FACT THAT THIS WAS DIFFERENT, BUT...","IN ONE OF HIS MORE SERIOUS OUTINGS, JACKIE CHAN PLAYS A COP WHO'S LOOKING TO SOLVE THE CASE OF A KIDNAPPING THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING MASTERMINDED BY THE COP HE'S ASSIGNED TO BE PARTNERED WITH. THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH MARTIAL ARTS HERE, BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTION AND IT'S A GOOD STORY. IF YOU'RE A FAN OF JACKIE'S MARTIAL ARTS-COMEDIES, YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA WATCH THIS FILM. BUT IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE ''DIRTY HARRY''-STYLE COP FILMS, THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. BASED ON REAL-LIFE EVENTS."
2,Crime Story,This was not my favorite Jackie Chan movie at all. It was OK but I found it kinda hard to follow and it really didn't keep my interest. I wouldn't recommend it. Never saw it before and probably not going to watch it again.
3,Where Hardboiled Lives,"Methaphor, descriptives, grit - Loren Estleman delivers it straight. No gratuitous violence, clear lines of right and wrong.""When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it."" Amos would, except he's the kind of guy who would never want a partner. In a world of compromise, moral shades of gray and groupthink, Amos Walker stands out as a model of clarity and purpose.Then there's Detroit. No one captures the flat grayness of the city like Estleman, and, now that they no longer make Oldsmobiles, I don't know what he'll have Amos driving next.For pure escape into a bad world made better by the shine of one man, it's hard to beat this series. Within the series, though, this installment is not one of the steongest."
5,Totally escapist meaty romance,"This was the first of Linda Lael Miller's books that I read and I was so impressed that I immediately went looking for another. The second one was just as satisfying as the first without being in any way a copy. If you are a fan of romances, this has all the makings of a good one plus more character development so that you become totally immersed in Valerian and Brenna's world(s)- a classic 'can't put it down'."
2,the first one I haven't loved,"I might be one of the only people that did not really enjoy this book. With the heroine having lived so many different lives, I felt that I was starting a new book as each life was told. It did not really flow very well; and, to tell you the truth, I did not like her character very much. She did not seem worthy of the hero's love."
3,It was okay,"I was a bit interested because it was a vampire story but i never felt the love between Valerian and Daisy. Daisy's character for me isn't good. She seems to be snapping at everyone and not serious at all. She's a detective but she doesn't seem like one. Valerian, however, doesn't seem really in love with her but only because she looks like his long love. It's just the face, I think, he fell in love with. I didn't like the their real love story in the past. Brenna (Daisy) was just 15 and Valerian was 17. The story never really tells anything how they really fell in love. It just tells that Valerian was attracted by her beauty. But I love the Valerian-Elizabeth part. I think that was the only part worth really reading. Valerian was in love with her even though she was a .... That about sums out what I think. It's my first time to read Linda Lael Miller's book and it wasn't that interesting."
4,Teddy Randazzo,It's been wonderful listening to music I first heard as a youngster many moons ago. I loved it then and moreso now. Lucy
3,"BEAR FAMILY, HELP!",ANY TIME THE BEAR FAMILY BRINGS OUT A C.D. OF AN ARTIST THEY INCLUDE EVERY SONG THE ARTIST RECORDED.THEY DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.WHERE IS THE ALBUM THE CHUCKLES RECORDED ON THE VIK LABEL? A VERY ROMANTIC ALBUM. TEDS VOICE SOUNDS GREAT!THAT MAN COULD SING!
3,For the price its ok,"Works well with cylindrical powders, flake powders not so well. I probably could have done without it but since i have it; I will use it for my rifle loads. For the price its ok."
2,Do Not Pay Full Price,"Like the other reviews state, the mirror DOES fog up, and the buttons are impossible to turn if your fingers are wet because they're just smooth plastic with no grip. The radio does have good sound for being so small, and the reception is very good (it has an external antenna)."
2,The Whispering Shower Radio,"The volume on this radio is diabolical. When the water goes on, i hear nothing. To add insult to injury, the player stopped working within 2 months. Spend the extra money and get something that lasts a while with better sound quality and volume. You will not regret it."
1,A REAL DUD !!!,"After reading some other reviews on this shower radio cd player, I just want to add, that the sound is so FEEBLE, you could place it next to a sleeping baby, turned on, volume set to maximum, and not worry about waking baby. Impossible to hear in the shower!!! I would have settled- if all I could hear was the treble, but this thing can barely muster a whisper. It's a joke. Don't buy it-you will be stuck with a useless radio/cd player. Too bad, because it is a good idea- shop carefully."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"For a shower cd/radio player this product is terrible. The sound is barely loud enough playing in a quiet room, much less in the shower, or with any kind of water running. I was very disappointed, I will shop around for a higher quality product next time."
2,Mirror not good,I wanted this for the mirror as well as the radio. The mirror is useless and doesn't clean up at all.
2,Piece of junk,First we got the item and it was missing a spring in the battery compartment. We made arrangements to send it back and it cost me @12 to do so. Then after 3 weeks we got a new one. This one does not alow the cover over the batteries to close and we have to use a piece of tape to keep it closed and I wonder how long that will last in the shower. A PIECE OF JUNK!
3,There are pros and cons...,"I just bought this for my husband for his birthday a few weeks ago and it works great. The CD player and the radio work great and the mirror does not fog up. However, it is really big and bulky and the clock is really tiny. Plus, there is no ""power off"" button so in order for you to turn it off, you just have to turn the knob to ""cd player"". Plus I did not like how the clock requires a totally separate battery in order for the clock to work."
1,don't buy,"When I first received this in the mail the clock did not work so I sent for another one and that clock did not work either. Then I realized that, unlike what's stated in the directions, there is no pull out tab for the clock battery so the battery is dead long before it gets to your door. It's a pain to replace and an annoyance because it's supposed to come with one working battery. Sound quality seems okay so far but be prepared to buy your own clock battery."
2,JENSEN JCR SHOWER CD PLAYER,"There were no problems hearing any CD's or AM stations, but the FM stations had too much static. I could not get any reception for the FM stations. I didn't care for this shower radio."
1,piece of crap,I expected much better sound quality from this product. I can't give a fair review of the rest of its features because as soon as I heard a CD played I packed the thing back up for a refund. My husband bought this to replace the larger radio we currently use hoping to save space in the bathroom. In my opinion it simply isn't worth purchasing if you actually want music to sound GOOD...but what can you expect from $40?
2,Bulky and Baulky,"Put any source of music into the shower, and you've vastly magnified the experience, whether that means waking up with more zest or soothing down with more soul. But something this large should pack more volume and more features - or cost less. For a few bucks less, you can get more in some competing products."
2,Almost good,"When I took the brand new unit out of the box there were some problems. The clock didn't work (pull the tab and it connects the battery) and neither did the light. The knob to turn the radio on is difficult to grasp especially when in the shower. The volume is loud which is a plus. The mirror fogs up immediately making it impossible to shave in the shower. I was looking for a unit that would let me listen to sports radio in the am when I shower, provide a fog free mirror so I could shave and provide the time so I wouldn't be late for work. This unit promises on all 3 but only delivers on 1. I wouldn't buy again or recommend."
2,Sizing way too small,"These are nice shoes, however the sizing is way small! I would recommend ordering at least a size or two larger than what you normally wear."
3,Maryland in Brief,"Reads like a high school civic textbook; worthless as a travel guide to the state. I gave my copy to my grandson, who can use the contents for a middle school essay reference."
1,None of them were able to fit in my laptop or router...,"I tried crimping these but the gold pins on them do not line up with 3 of my rj-45 crimpers. Had to use a screwdriver to lock down wire. Then tried plugging it in, but it didnt fit. These are complete crap..."
4,Mrs. Pollifax in Thailand,"Mrs. Pollifax is trying to recover from her last adventure in Hong Kong and is planning a trip to Thailand with her new husband, Cyrus. Just as they are about to leave, CIA emissary Bishop arrives and asks them to go on a ""simple mission"" in which they would divert their travels only slightly and would deliver something to an agent and retrieve something in return.She and Cyrus agree and soon they are off on their latest misadventure. As always, in Mrs. Pollifax tales, things do not go according to plan and there are unfortunate incidents of murder, kidnapping, and opium dealing before Mrs. Pollifax finally triumphs and ties up these untidy details in a nice, neat package. This is a typical book in the series."
3,Pollifax too passive,"The Pollifax series is a great series that I highly recommend. In this contribution, the location is Thailand, which with its local color and interesting characters, has the possible of being one of the best of the series. But somehow it does not quite live up to this potential. Mrs Pollifax is too passive, relaying on her Thai guide to solve all the problems and constantly complaining that he is not doing it fast enough. I prefer a more assertive Pollifax, who because of her empathy for other people, depite stumbling around, always manages to be in the right place at the right time. This book has some of those elements, but not enough. Still for fans of the series, it is a nice contribution. If it is your first visit to the series, I would recommend you start with another. But by all means, start."
5,Ruthless Ninja,"Shadow Warrior is an action book about a modern-day ninja named, Lo Wang, that wants to get revenge and recover a powerful device able to destroy the world. The action is intense and bloody. In the first chapter of the book, some assassins try to kill, Lo Wang inside a sushi bar. Lo Wang, dispatches the baddies real quick and tortures the last one for information; he cuts a piece of the bad guy's nose and shows it to him. Yes the action is brutal and really not for kids (okay for teenagers). Lo Wang, the star of the story is ruthless against his enemies and yet has a snappy sense of humor. It was full of very funny one liners and it had me laughing out out. Very few books can deliver this type of excitement and humor, but Shadow Warrior: For Dead Eyes Only, has best of both worlds. I highly suggest buying it!"
4,Cool and Awesome as anything your apt to read,"This book had my attention from the very start. Better that the Doom series. It plunges readers straight into our hero, Wang, and his quest for revenge. It was just literally fun travelling with him and wish-it-was-true girlfriend Flo. We are taken to many lands and many gory battles, all to end up in a climax unlike any other I have previously read. You don't have to be a fan of the game or even be a young to enjoy it."
4,DVD Player,Better than the panasonic that I bought last year. No problems noted at this point. Battery life seems goood
5,Audiovox DVD Player,"I only use this product as a security monitor, but I have been very pleased with it. I have never used the actual dvd player,only the screen. I started out with one and then purchased another just like it."
4,Lasted a while....,"Got this from costco back in late 2007 with 2 headphones and carrying case including car/cig. adaptor.Worked fine until May 2011. But it went through abuse, drops, on aircraft, car, foreign countries. Basically surprised this lasted as long. Only technical issue is that the battery never lasted more than 90min. And only got worse as time went on. Now it lasts about 30min, is starting to get flaky with reading disks at startup. It's been retired to being a home player hooked up to our LCD tv. Not sure how much longer it could last, so will start shopping for a home blu ray player.In summation, I expected it to only last a few months, which is why I got it from ""return-it-for-refund-after-a-couple-years"" Costco. Well, after this long, I won't return it, can't complain.This is the only audiovox product purchased, so can't generalize."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR THE $$$$,"Though it has input options usb,sd reader 'n' such. It falls short when it comes to operations, such as no memory if you should turn unit off, no fast forward/rewind w/o remote(though the remote is a nice size!)and a wee bit noisy 'n' clunky. Sadly I must add that it did not last very long afore giving out on me. Hope y'all have better luck then I, did I mention it was not cheap?"
4,I wish I had purchased this sooner.,I am very happy with my Audiovox DVD player. I read a lot of reviews and this seemed like the best product. I take it when I travel and must spend time being bored in hotel rooms. I also purchased headphones for it and the stereo sound is awesome. I would encourage anyone looking for a portable DVD player to buy the Audiovox D1917 9-inch player. It is exceptional value for the money.
2,Stopped working,"Ours was used maybe 10 times a year. Into the second year, it stopped working. Cannot read a disc is in it and fails while trying to load."
2,Lasted 8 months,"This DVD player was pretty nice while it lasted. We had it for 8 months before it stopped working. The warranty is only for 3 months. It stopped loading DVDs. It would spin, but not load.The picture was nice and clear, sound was pretty good.This time we are going with a Sony - in my opinion a more reliable brand with a year warranty."
3,Okay system,"Not a bad system though I reccomend getting a bigger HDD drive. I've had Gateway's in the past and had no trouble with the tech support, but then I haven't had any serious problems with any of my Gateway systems."
1,HP Monitor,"The item was never sent to me, I received an email only stating that it was no available."
5,Brent Jones & TP Mobb,"Parents: Share with your teen age children the gift of music by an annointed slammin' jammin' artist. Oh yes, you can be saved, sanctified, and hip. Wouldn't you rather for them to hear the ""good news/gospel"" in ""good times"" than in secular meaningless & degrading rap. Fill their heads with melodies of heaven than of rhythms of hell! Buy this one NOW! You will be impressed!"
4,Rough Edges is a perfect description of me learning God,The overall albums is beautifully put together. I think it is a perfect album for anyone trying to find their way with the Almighty God. Rough Edges hit home everytime I listen to it. Thanks.
5,LOVED IT!! LOVED IT!! LOVED IT!!,"BRENT JONES AND THE T.P. MOBB DID A WONDERFUL JOB ON THIS ALBUM! MUCH PROPS TO THEM AND I WISH THEM LUCK!!! IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT GO OUT AND GRAB IT, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED; BELIEVE THAT!!!"
4,Good stuff,"The record company wanted Therion to put out a new album and they weren't ready yet, so this is what you got. The songs don't really go together, but there is a lot of awsome material on the album. Besides the typical Therion songs like Crowning of Atlantis (very good!) and from dynosis days (love it!), you also have a remake of Clavicula Nox (originally from Vovin), a cover of an Accept song (Seawinds), a cover of a man o war song that is awsome but sounds nothing like Therion (Thor), and also a few live tracks.If you want an album that ""flows"" together don't buy this one. It's just a random assortment of whatever therion could throw together at the time, but the songs in and of themselves are all very good."
2,"Dang, I should have listened to this before I bought it","Sorry to break the string of good reviews on this album, but I just can't let this album slide. Having really enjoyed Theli, I thought this would be a decent album. Maybe I'm just a bit tired of the whole orchestra metal thing, but this album is boring anyway. Thought there are moments of intriguing composition, most of the album seems like a forced effort to combine church choir and rock. And what the heck are songs like Crazy Nights and Thor doing on here? They don't quite fit, but maybe that's an attempt to break up this monotonous recording. As I listen to it right now, I can see how parts might grow on me a little more, but Theli is just far superior."
4,Good,Good cd. Love the older country music. So much cheaper to just buy the album from here and rip it to iTunes rather than get from the itunes store.
5,wonderful music,Tis is one of my favorite cd's by one of my favorite artists. I owned one of these before and absolutely played it one too many times.
4,"Good, but far from Perfect","I have always been predisposed to be discouraged by albums that have consistently short and underdeveloped tracks. After listening to this album my belief has been confirmed as correct. This CD is fine. And I'm sure it will grow on me. But, after all is said and done, it shows only glimpes of what made Right Now one of my favorite CDs ever; it shows only segments reminsicent of their first release. Nobody wants a lot of the same, and neither did I with this release, but I also did not want too crazy, too fast and too hard.Sorry,Trevor from NH"
1,not what it claims,"I bought this album because it claimed to be like ""modest mouse"" and ""mars volta"" and ""q and not u"" which it is not. i couldn't even finish listening to any of the songs. my advice is that if you like, linkin park, hoobastank, or alkaline trio you'll like this album, but it is defintely no modest mouse"
3,"Great Music, poor CD","Peter Alexander does a terrific job of singing. He has a great voice. The problem is that we play all our CD's on my computer because our CD player is old and noisy. Unfortunately, the manufacturer has done something to the CD so that it will not play on my computer. That means that we can only hear it in the car. I would have returned it except that the shipping cost to Germany whence it came was too much."
1,Just because they're on Psychopathic....,"Does NOT give you any reason to jock them this hard.I saw them on toure with Shaggy and they got no love. Not just from me, but from the whole crowd...wanna know why? Because theyre wack as hell.The only good tracks are the noes with ICP, Twiztid and Blaze....and like i said before, just because theyre on Psychopathic, doesnt mean anything. Lookit Zug, for example. Yeah, they sucked, and EVERY juggalo was jocking them.AMB can bite my bag, but ill forver be Reppin the HatchetIn 2 albums theyll be gone..."
4,THIS CD IS DOPE,"I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY CAN HATE ON THESE GUYS, I LOVE THEM. IF I SAY THIS, PEOPLE WILL HATE ME BUT OH WELL. LISTEN, YOU CALL YOURSELVES JUGGALOS BUT YOU DISS THESE GUYS, THATS WRONG, THEIR DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT, JUST LIKE ICP DID WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT, AND I THINK THATS COOL."
4,Blood In Blood Out,"Pretty solid cd, not everything song is good but overall not to bad. Great beats and production. Better then anything Twiztid has put out in the last 7-8 years."
3,Axe Murder Boyz,"I love all the Psychopathic artists but this album is a bit weak. I had high hopes for this album due seem as they had to get through and win the underground psychos contest. All the props where dropped for this duo but i think that it doesnt deliver the goods. If you do mind ABK then i suggest get this, but if you prefer the styles of Twiztid, ICP and Esham then don't. MCL & MFLMMFCL"
3,Rips of System of a Down Riff,Not cool--rips of the melody off of one of the new System songs on the track Honor (listen to the clip--System of A Down fans should be able to pick it out very easily)-- I don't like when people try to pass off other people's stuff as original. I don't think I would buy this unless it was used for like three bucks.
3,Very mediocore debut,"I expected more from this album, but it just falls flat. Most of the production is pretty good, and I don't have a problem with the AMB's flow, but nothing on the album stands out as great or even original. Hopefully they will continue to get better and turn out to be a good addition to psychopathic."
3,NONLYRICAL!!,"I was hoping for something alittle more lyrical....little use of the higher octave bowls here....the ones that produce the most pleasant sounds. This CD will be excellent for meditation, however, since the reverberations of the bowls literally ""penetrate"" the body and, therefore, carry you to a different plane of consciousness. But to use as ""quiet backround"" in the home this CD isn't ""pleasant"" enough...I had hoped to use it for that purpose too."
2,A Tedius and Boring Read,"I bought this book because of its 5 star reviews. Well, all I can say is, I must have read a different book than the previous reviewers, or they must have been friends of the author, because I can't believe anyone would rate this book highly.It is long, tedious, poorly written and shows signs of not being proof-read properly:* Contains lots of lists and descriptions to fill up space without adding conceptual content (do we really need to see every field on a form in a list?).* Poorly structured. All of the narrative appears at the front of a section followed by examples that don't properly illustrate the text.* Many examples contain errors and are difficult to follow, again, because they aren't properly tied into the narrative."
1,Horrible Book!!!,"I'm an IT graduate and am very accustomed to reading technical resources. This book is one of the worst I have seen. The screen caps that are referenced in the text are hardly ever on the same page as the text. Lots of the descriptions about radio buttons are a twist on the descriptions given by the environment. Clumsy book. I don't know what to recommend as replacement, but not worth the $50 I bought it for. I wouldn't even pay $25 for it."
2,do not buy,"Cost cutting in many places is evident with this unit. The screen resolution is 800x480 , but not as sharp as other players with high end screen display. The unit does not have a true last scene memory function , but one that is totally useless for resuming a program from where it previously stopped. Why is this done-- cost savings ? Also, the AV input does not work .I would stay away from this player"
4,"Great 10"" Portable DVD Player","This is a great DVD Player. For those of you who like me have young kids and didn't get the DVD package when buying your mini van, this is a great alternative. I also purchaced the Mo Go holder and when assembled correctly it provides a sturdy holder for this player between the two front headrest. The player also comes with media card slots to veiw slide shows of pictures from your digital camera. We just went away on vacation and held out as long as we could 3 hours in the car, and then put up the DVD player. There was total silence from the kids in back car seats................Priceless!!!"
2,I actually prefer my old 7-inch Coby player,"My husband just bought this to replace the 7-inch Coby player he bought me many years ago. He got this one because of the bigger screen.I find the sound to be pretty decent but I don't care for the picture. It's not very sharp and it seems to cut a little off the top of the picture. For example, I'm used to seeing someone's entire head but with this player their head is either at the very top of the screen or the top of their head is gone.We'll probably return it and get something with a better picture."
2,Does NOT play PAL format,"One of the reviewers stated that this Audiovox D2017 10.2-Inch Slim Line Portable DVD Player plays PAL format also. I needed a portable player that would support this format and region 1. However, the regular review never states that it plays PAL DVDs.Do not be mislead... it does NOT play PAL.Also, for $184 it is rather flimsy and seems cheaply made.Very disappointed."
3,There are better models for just a little more,I purchased this for price but its not as good as others it is bulkier than others in this screen size plastic feel. No memory card reader like others. only good thing is it reads VCD's MP3 CD's and picture CD's and that the controls are on the unit but not all of them some must go thought the remote control so don't lose it. Also i like and find swivel screen units are better and the ones that are rubberish instead of plasticy.
4,Audiovox D2017 10.2-Inch Slim Line Portable DVD Player (Black),Great DVD player. Wish it would have come with a car mounting kit. Had just the electrical cords for the car and house. Fast delivery.
4,"Very good, but short of brilliant","If this book had one problem, it was trying to match together American spelling with English grammar and structure. Hamer would have done better sticking with what he knows best.Having said that, the plot was credible, modern and neatly tied together at the end. Some of the descriptions were truly delightful. It's a good read, and well worth buying."
5,Now one of my favorites,"I never heard of the Isle of Man before, but now maybe I'll make a visit next time I'm in Europe (I looked it up on a map, and it really does exist!). This terrific story is based there (and in Paris) and the settings are brilliant. I felt like I was at the movies watching the surroundings for real. The characters in the book are great (very European, but great just the same!) and the story itself is VERY well plotted. I thought I had it all puzzled out once or twice, but then hit another twist in the story and found I'd got it wrong. If I have one criticism, it's that I wanted the story to keep going - I just didn't want it to end. Probably due to the fact that I got totally involved with the characters and wanted to see what would happen to them next. Maybe Graham Hamer will write a sequel (?)"
3,Where's the next LP?,"This feels like a toss-off, a space-filler until the band has enough material for a full LP. Live version of ""Fearless"" doesn't add much to the original. Rest of the cuts are largely forgettable. Nothing here measures up to ""Michigan"" or ""Sugar Pill"" from the previous full-length album."
5,Blending the Physical and the Myth,"A wonderful read, both encouraging and disheartening, with some real family values thrown in. A graphic, first-hand description of the way things were and are, and might be. Mr. Preston provides many enduring messages about the sanctity of life and living that the Bilagaana have nearly completely lost in our rush of subservience to the technology god."
5,Enchanting adventure in the Navajo Nation,"It helps immensely to have travelled to the Navajo Nation when reading this story. I found that I had minor interest in the developing family story, compared to the lore and myth of the SW Native Americans. If you've travelled to the SW and are familiar with horses, you'll love this book."
5,Laughs Galore,"""Six Strong Guys"" is a hilarious romp with guys who form a suicide pact. All sorts of delightful subplots interweave in & out. Of particular note is Andy Hui who was excellent as the doctor in ""Koma."" Here his comic skills highlight what a versatile actor he is. You might not think 6 guys trying to commit suicide by jumping off a skyscraper is the basis for a hilarious comedy, but it is. George Lam's fast-paced direction suits this script that has wit, style, and laughs galore, even with English subtitles. Certainly, this is one DVD to enjoy for all who appreciate the new wave of Asian cinema. Bravo!"
4,"Hey, there is nothing WRONG with this book","I have had this book for a few weeks and had put off reading it because of the poor reviews. Hoping that Rusch hadn't finally let me down, I read it last night. The book is as good as the rest of the series. I'm just not sure that the other reviewers have read the rest of the series. Personally, I like the Retrieval Artist books because humans aren't the biggest bad in the galaxy. Humans in these books have to try to get along and work around the cultural hang-ups located in alien cultures while trying to maintain our own nature and culture. Humans in these books work with (or around- hence the need for the Retrieval Artist) the alien cultures and try to respect them (within reason- therein lays the conflict or narrative hook necessary for a good book) and not just saying the universe is wrong and humans are always right (or we will blow you up)."
4,Questionable premise but still good hard science fiction,"Like some of the other reviewers, I do have some problems with a universe where humanity is part of an alliance with aliens who have extremely strange and barbaric laws. Before dismissing this concept completely though, I should point out that no one has yet met any aliens, so we have no idea of alien culture and know absolutely nothing about their laws. This might make the premise of the novels slightly easier to swallow.Having got that objection out of the way, I think that Rusch does an extremely good job in creating a realistic future world although I was somewhat bothered with the hero on the moon speaking to someone on Mars in apparent real time. The character development is very well done and the police work a believable future extrapolation.I didn't think this book was quite as good as some of the previous ones but it was still a very enjoyable read. I hope the series continues."
5,Best RA yet,"I'm reading them in order, some years after reading Recovery Man when it first came out.This one is tight.Also, I'm hoping KKR develops Ki Bowles in more detail in the future. Lots of great potential there."
2,Only fair rating,This is one of the better encyclopedias on African Americans. But I can't figure out how they could put Denzel Washington and Aretha Franklin in this book and forget Dr. Vernon Johns.
5,Wonderful Source of Information on Black Experience,"This encyclopedia is a wonderful source of information on all aspects of the African experience, both on the African continent itself and in the diaspora. Without being ideological, it celebrates the Black experience by summing up the fruits of many decades of scholarly research into Black culture and history. The articles that I have read are well written and reliable in the information they provide, while also remaining accessible to a general audience. (I regret a bit that there are no bibliographies to direct the reader towards further readings on each topic.) The volume, lavishly illustrated, is so heavy that one could use it for advanced workouts... That the publishers have managed to publish it at such an extremely reasonable price is in itself an amazing achievement. This book should be on the bookshelf of every educated person of African descent, and of every American, whether black or white."
5,Not just for Africans and African-Americans,"This is a fabulous, comprehensive and fascinating piece of work. Like most encyclopedias, you can open it anywhere and start reading for pure pleasure and knowledge.It would be unfortunate if many of my fellow Whites dismissed this work as something only of interest to Blacks. You can learn a lot about Black people in Africa and America from this book but you can learn just as much about White history. Much of their history is our history, too, just as son much of our history is theirs. We are one people.This book belongs in any home where knowledge, understanding and the simple joy of good reading are important."
4,great!,"I have used this on my computer in my cruiser for over a year and a half now. Its a bit heavy, but produces good light. The switch on top to turn it on and off is a very nice feature. I had to put duct tape around the edges to keep the light from blinding me."
1,TOO HEAVY,"Too heavy. trust me it will eventually wreck your usb input eventually. also lights burned out within 6 months. I got stick on glow in the dark keyboard lettes, the best solution, Glow in the dark stick on keyboard letters. you will love them."
5,Very nice Light,"This light is very nice, illuminate a lot my laptop and his structure is very adaptable and flexible, 100% recomended buy this light usb"
2,Notebook light,"The light works, but they forgot to mention that it is BRILLIANT BLUE!When contacted Amazon they referred me to the subcontractor, who did not respond to my email.They however sent me a solicitation to recommend them to Amazon.I don't think so!"
2,Real Sex 2000,"Today the craze in Reggae music is riddims. Many albums are distributed by Greensleeves and VP Records that have only one riddim. Some find this boring.However, on Real Sex 2000, there are 3 riddims: Orgasm, Intercourse, and Real Sex. The 3 riddims are on CD 2 (yes, Real Sex 2000 is a 2 CD set). CD 2 is a continuous mix, useful for your Reggae parties.Artists on this album include Sean Paul, Mr Vegas, Lexxus. The distributor is VP Records, the largest distributor of Reggae music in the United States."
1,Kosovo (Anthem Slavic and Russian Studies),"Only intellectual blindness may prevent reader to instantly recognize Stephen Schwartz subjective and groundless interpretation of history.His comic conclusions, and irresponsible pro-Albanian propaganda are only surpassed by his blunt and mindless hatred of anything and everything that is Slavic.Don't waste your money..."
1,Save your money!!!!!!!,"Unless you have a computer with 1995 windows or lower DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT COMPATIBLE!!!!!!!! It isn't worth one cent! With a lot of work I got the CD to work, but my computer kept closing down the program because it thought it was a virus. My computer which has Windows XP did not recognize many of the programs charachters so if your confused about Calculus it will only confuse you more. It's useless, I regret buying it. Save yourselves!!! And your money!!!!!!!!"
2,Not worth buying.,This pamphlet gives the basic disassemble and reassemble instructions for the M1 Carbine. Nothing to in-depth; lacks details. I would not have bought this manual if I were able to page through and read parts of it first. Save your money.
2,Real basic,I have to agree with the last reviewer. This book is very basic with hand drawn illustrations. I think I had to reference one minor step when I cleaned my carbine the first time. The info in this book can be found online for free.
4,"Great Read, Must have for Carbine owners",This is a must for M1 Carbine Owners/Enthusiasts. Very detailed information and pictures help explain the dissassembly process a lot. Would've given it 5 stars (and paid more for it) if it had been printed with color photos for clarity and showed reassembly instead of saying reverse the dissassembly process.
3,Ok...,"Meets minimum standards for assembly/disassembly. Would have been better with info on where to purchase the specialized tools, how to lubricate and what kind of lubrication and perhaps some photographs rather than drawing."
4,Crunchy Breadsticks,These are very crunchy breadsticks perfect for a small snack or compliment for dinner. You usually get about 7 to 9 breadsticks per packet which is plenty and leaves you satisfied. These are breadsticks recommended as part of the HCG diet and allow you a card indulgence. The thin flavor is a bit bland compared to the rosemary flavor but still good when paired with more spicy or full flavored foods.
2,good taste but poor quality control,When these are properly baked they are very good. But 1/3 to 1/2 of the sticks were over cooked to the point where I threw them away.
2,Breadcrumbs,"I was very disappointed when I received these. The box was crushed on one end and there was no packing inside the box to keep the box containing the breadsticks from moving around. As a result, some boxes contain not much better than bread crumbs. I wanted to use these for gifts at Christmas presented with a decorated container to set them in and homemade spaghetti sauce and salad dressing.I would not purchase these this way again unless you want to use them for breading."
3,Good and proper. Nothing outstanding.,Could be moister I think. But not the way they come. Proper flavor and maybe moist enough. I did not like the extra vitamins type as much due to the maybe some added flavor. Plums great for laxative.
3,The camera always lies,"ive just recently read this book, at first it is awesome and really gets you interested (the first chapter) then by the second chapter it gets confusing but slowly the plot, setting and chacters start to let them selves be known, by the end of the book, all the surprises and secrets come clean and some things were quite shocking. all and all i really enjoyed this book, it is a good read for people who are commited and will take the time to get into it..."
5,Eye opening book!,This book was very different from all the others written about Edgar Cayce's readings. It was well put together and truly gave an amazing look into the story of Jesus not told everyday. Highly recommend this book.
1,Tedious,"""Tedious"" is the word I would use to describe my experience with this book and that's not the experience I'm looking for. The other Cayce books that I've read on Reincarnation, Atlantis, and Prophecy were easy to read and fascinating. What I found difficult was the author's explanation of the Readings and the Readings themselves. I found myself reacting after each Reading with ""Huh? What is he talking about?"" Believe me, I mean no disrepect towards Mr. Cayce and his work. I just found the book difficult to digest. Perhaps now wasn't the time to read it."
3,Chaotic but fun to read.,"Overall, the presenting of the material is a bit, confusing and scattered. BUT, if one has some background experience and understanding of current scripture, one can identify those areas of interest as one reads the text, and have fun with comparing ""visions"" to scriptural reference."
1,Read this book. You will like Jesus the Christ.,"I am not a Christian the way your traditional doctrines define Christian. However, I do believe in The Christ. He is an amazing role model for us all. Knowing about his real story does not change that. It shouldn't change that. Cayce's information fills in many gaps left by the Bible. For those who choose to use the Bible as their only source, this book will scare them because it shakes the foundations upon which their faith is based.Others of us will enjoy the Story; take comfort in it and perhaps become inspired by it.If you are non-traditional Christian, a person brought up in a Structured and flawed church (as was I), a pagan, Witch, Spiritualist, atheist... Read this book You will like Jesus The Christ."
3,"Interesting, but disjointed","The author presents information from the Edgar Cayce ""readings"" which have to do with Jesus and who he was. Essentially, additional details are given about his birth, childhood, ministry, death and resurrection. Cayce's unique spin on the Christian message is blended in and it's very fascinating.The trouble is that the book relies too much on the ""readings"" themselves which are somewhat obtuse, instead of just explaining to us what was meant and in what context it applies. The result is that the individual parts of the book don't really blend together into a whole and a lot of questions are left unanswered.Nevertheless, it presents an interesting spin on Jesus and made me want to read more Cayce-related information."
4,Excellent Elightening Book,"This book is probably one of the greater books of Enlightenment. Now I advise people- ""Do not change your religion according to Cayce's views on Christ, especially if you are Christian. Not even Cayce wanted you to do that"". One thing is that Cayce's view of Christ was a soul like us who had many incarnations- especially Adam and Jesus. And he is the first soul to become one with God. Now Cayce has bridged Eastern ideas with Western Ideas. I think he did an amazing job in his unconsciousness connecting the dots with all world ideas on mind-body-spirit. I suggest you read this book for greater Awareness and opening your mind to new thoughts, but take everything new he says about Christ with a grain a salt, even if you are Christian, Muslim, Hindu, or whatever."
5,Most enlightening non-Bible book I'veever read,"Read it. Cayce's unconscious way of describing the beauty of this world an our opportunites to reelate with God are just beautiful. Fascinating ideas, inspirational language, beautiful inter-life stories. Can be a bit listy at times going through the various life readings that make up most of the book, but just too valuable not to read. I'm buying copies to give away."
3,Not perfect,"While I paid less than the $99 it is listed for now I am still not pleased. Many spoons are not the proper shape. They have ""rippled"" edges and some spoons are correct which tells me they are not consistant with the pattern. The finish on some pieces has spots or discoloration marks which are permanent. We use them everyday but I am already looking for a better set that is forged and not stamped and so lightweight. I have felt much lighter weight sets but this one could be heavier. I would have given less stars but they were priced very well and came with a lot of extras and I don't get worried when the kids walk outside with a spoon to eat ice cream."
1,star website is defunct,"Don't waste the extra money on the ""name a star"" gimmick. I got a bear for my child over a month ago, and the website continually says ""come back later""."
4,Good book,"This is a good book. It's about this boy named C.J Jackson who lives in Oklahoma during the dust bowl in 1935. He moves to California with his family where he experiences hardships and prejudice. This book is a good history book, that teaches about this era."
1,Disappointed!,"Based on the information provided by the seller I thought I was getting a pretty good book for the price.NOT! The front and back cover were coming apart, so I had to tape it together, and the corners of the pages were all turned up. The seller did not tell the truth about the condition of the book. I paid way to much for it compared to other books that students in my class bought from another website."
4,Really liked it.,This movie was the kind of family drama that I love. Never thought a daughter could be so cruel. Highly recommend.
3,"Great Story, Entertaining Piece of Filmmaking, but ...","This is a lovingly crafted piece of work, an uncompromising look at the ways in which women of the mid-twentieth century struggled to survive in an overwhelmingly patriarchal world. The settings are brilliant, the photography atmospheric, the performances quite unexpectedly good, especially from Winslet in the eponymous title role and Guy Pierce as her ne'er-do-well boyfriend. It might last five hours, but it's addictively entertaining. But I'm unfortunately a buff for old Hollywood; and I couldn't stop myself comparing this new version with the brilliant Michael Curtiz/ Joan Crawford effort from the mid-1940s. This effort is much more comprehensive, more evocative of James M. Cain's world as set down in the source-text. But I have to admit I like the old version better."
3,review of the first hour,"A tale of a struggling mother trying to overcome her situation. rags to riches story. they did a great job recreating the 1930s. great set design. everthing from a deppression-glass sugar bowl on the kitchen table to the antique cars in the street. Similar to the movie ""amelia"" which starrted hilary swank as amelia and richard gere as ""george putnam."" no suspense. no huge gripping plot. you enjoy it for the cinematography, and 1930s studio props. you know how it ends, but you enjoy the calm mellow journey."
1,Not The Joan Crawford Classic:,"Seriously considered ordering this item but borrowed it from a friend instead. Very glad I did not spend good money to purchase this overly long piece of trash. Does not even come close to the quality of the original Joan Crawford classic, which is one of my all time favorite movies."
3,Disappointed,"I thought it was going to be great, but it wasn't. Although the cast is perfect, the acting and the set designs, costumes, music was perfect, the writing was not good. I have not read the book, and perhaps this is a more accurate interpretation of it, but the ending was so awful..esp. Winslett's last line, I'm sure she hated to even say it. I felt that her character was heading for alcoholism and a sad life, given her final choice...not, in character for Mildred Pierce ."
3,Don't watch when tired,Five parts which leaves information out between parts. First 5 minutes figuring out how we got here. If using Blu-ray UPDATE your firmware prior to viewing. Part three froze at same spot and the only thing that got it to play past the spot without skipping over was to remove and then update the firmware. Price not worth paying dvd/bluy-ray combo. Scenes not pretty enough to spend on Blu-ray.
5,FAITHFUL AT LAST,"Obviously those who hated this dramatization have never read the book. The Joan Crawford movie was a totally basterdized and sanitized version.A good comparison would be the 1950s heavily edited version of East of Eden, then the faithful mini-series made with Jane Seymour, that took the original almost line for line from the book.What I found most amazing, having grown up in Los Angeles in the 40s and 50s was the filming in NY state. I personally grew up knowing all the locations in the book. The streets and houses used were faithful to the same period house in Glendale CA. The 'Pasadena' mansions were also faithful. Even the drive to Laguna Beach, looked like the drives I made with my family between Santa Monica and Laguna Beach before the entire coast was built up.I waited for months, with great expectations and wasn't disappointed. Cain wrote his characters raw, and that's how this mini-series played out."
2,Bad casting and far too long,Kate Winslet does a fine job with Mildred but the rest of the cast is absolutely awful!! VEDA is the worst of all---horrible acting and not at all like the character in the book. Wish I could have the hours back that I wasted onthis miniseries---HBO certainly did not do this one justice.
3,Just okay....I felt it was a little slow. Watch Joan Crawford knock it out of the park,"This moved way too slow.....the acting was okay, but the story line was so much better in the Joan CRawford version. You have to hand it to Kate Winslet though, for taking on this Oscar winning role..."
5,good show,I would recommend this series to anyone who likes drama and strong character development. The story was really interesting and it held my attention to the end.
4,The evil of narcissism,"The first hours were not as interesting as the original and didn't emphasize as much the loathsome character of Veda but as the ending epidodes occurred Veda's evil nature was more fully revealed and it made the movie memorable. It shows how denial (Mildred's) in parents is strong and they often cannot see their children (or other people generally, I suppose) for what they truly are."
4,GREAT PERIOD DETAIL IN THIS RETRO CHICK FLICK,"James Caine's 1941 novel is the strong source material for Joan Crawford's magnificent 1945 melodrama as well as indie director Todd Haynes' terrifically turbulent HBO cable mini-series about a stridently single mom who works overtime to make ends meet and win her daughter's love in a Depression riddled LA. Kate Winslett is an indelible Mildred. The highest caliber talent has crafted this truly sumptuous-looking film. The period detail is often close to perfect -- especially the vintage feel of Glendale, California -- a place with which I am familiar."
3,A well made remake expansion on a classic,"The acting is first class by all the cast, story line held your interest for the duration although very slow at times. Great entertainment for those who remember the time, could be a bit boring for the younger generation."
4,Not Old Hollywood,This is not your mothers Mildred Pierce. While closer to the book then the Joan Crawford version. That version was a far superior film.
1,TERRIBLE BOOK WITH NO THRILLS OR EXCITEMENT,"Where was the excitement? Where was the tension and suspense? This book had everything happen in such a straightforward and dull manner that nothing was a surprise at all. The villians, heroes, side characters were all done so matter of factly that it was impossible for the reader to feel anything while reading the book. Moreover, I think the book can't compare to the same level as the masters in the genre, so it comes across as a pale and weak imitation. I would advise the author to come up with something more original and unique the next time."
1,ILLOGICAL AND DULL STORY,"The novel is full of so many inconsistencies and illogical actions that its very hard to appreciate any other aspect. The characters are shallow. Period. The plot's premise has some interest but the author can't seen to focus on the main theme and loses interest (thereby losing the reader). And the motivations of the characters are utterly ridiculous and unbelieveable. I don't mind books in the genre and there are quite a few good ones that can thrill you and lead to some pleasant diversion--this, however, is one of the worse of the genre and doesn't impact you at all."
1,LEAVES YOU WITH THE BIG EMPTY FEELING,"After enduring chapter after chapter of the same old actions, you'll wonder why you started this book in the first place. Of all the books in this kind of genre, it has little new to offer, virtually no new wrinkles, and it borrows heavily and liberally from other styles and plots. Everything is predictable and this makes for very little tension and excitement. The characters are a farce and a pale imitation of real people. The motives for each of the characters is incredibly weak, and this makes it very difficult to be persuaded with anything that they do. The ending chase is so long and drawn out that you feel no thrill when its over--just glad that the author finally moved on to the next scene. This book doesn't even read like a movie or screenplay."
1,DULL AND NOT ENTERTAINING,"The author was unable to really sustain any suspense to this book. The plot was so typical of thrillers these days, that only one skilled in characters and imagery could pull it off, and the author was deficient in both areas. I found the actions totally predictable and the characters were so weak and illogical, I just about gave up on finishing the book. Those looking for this type of genre would be better served waiting for a Crichton or a Cussler."
1,"BELOW AVERAGE, RUN OF THE MILL THRILLER","Don't confuse this with anything from Michael Crichton--it doesn't come close on any level of originality, suspense, science, or characters. Instead, this is a very ordinary thriller that has very little impact on you after you're finished with the book. The science part is promising, but what I really don't like is the haphazzard way it is introduced, and, toward the end, it seemingly shifts to secondary importance. Really! The motivations behind the different characters is quite poor and unconvincing. The action is quite predictable so that the reader won't be thrilled or held in any suspense. In the end, this is a very very ordinary thriller with a very poor execution."
1,UNEXCITING AND BORING,"This is a poorly written thriller that fails on all levels to excite or interest the reader. The plot has some interesting ideas, but the author is uneven--some parts are gone over in enough detail and other parts are skimmed over like they were afterthoughts. This gives the reader too much opportunity to see the logic faults in the story. The characters aren't particularly sympathetic and I agree with other reader comments that they were too artificial and predictable."
1,"Leaves you with a big ""SO WHAT?""","I found the book so unoriginal and predictable that it really didn't hold my interest. Characters were so predictable it was laughable. Even if the idea wasn't original, at least the author could have made it interesting, but he glosses over so many key details, and lingers painfully long on the unimportant, you wonder what's going on. The ending was so anti-climatic due to the failure to keep you in suspense, you're relieved when the book if finally over. I think the author needs to really refine his storytelling skills before trying another."
1,MEDIOCRE THRILLER WITH LITTLE TO OFFER THATS NEW,"Not much new from my point of view. The characters were typecast right from a TV show or worse, a movie. The gratuitous sex seemed so out of place and juvenile in its timing that I think the author threw it in just for kicks and nothing else. The plot villians were cardboard stereotypes with wholly unrealistic motives and convictions that really wouldn't withstand the test of time. The ending was a complete bore. The author needs to seriously contribute something unique rather than just be another Clive Cussler or Michael Critchten wanna-be...."
1,PREDICTABLE AND WEAK IMMITATION,"The book was totally predictable and had very little original ideas. The plot seemed to be based on a TV movie or worse, a TV show. The science/technical aspects were a bit hollow and the characters were poorly developed. You could easily see how the plot was going to end. Chase scene at the end was absolutely so long and terrible, you ended up laughing and hoping for the villians to win. I don't think this book was very entertaining at all."
2,As hollow as an empty cereal box,"I picked up Reaper knowing what I was getting into ... a technothriller not a literary classic. Still, even the wildest plot line needs some semblance of logic. Here the two ""ordinary"" people who are the main characters possess every ability known to man: brains, athleticism; plus knowledge of medicine, science, computer technology and criminal techniques. I'm surprised they didn't build their own cars from twigs and tape. And I think the chase scene at the end may still be going on. There are some interesting scientific concepts here if you can fight through the papier mache characters to get to them. It was a disappointing book ... probably because it was a really a screenplay."
1,One of the worst books I've read this year.,"No, make that ever. I read the first chapter online and liked it, and bought the book because of it. Then it turns out that the character who thinks he's dying in that chapter really does die, and he was the only likeable character in the entire book.The plot is ridiculous, the technology writing is inane, the business insights are ludicrous, the characters are pretty much all one-dimensional cliches.I would nominate this book for the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" award. I think there's also an award for bad poetry (is it the McGonneghal?). Anyway, I've always thought there was something fascinating about absolutely wretched writing, and if you don't agree, then there's absolutely no reason for you to buy this book."
2,where was the editor?,"Ulike many here, I did not think the book was bad, tho unremarkable. But I cannot forgive STUPID technical errors that authors in the genre should not make and editors are paid to catch. A 15-round 9mm Baretta is NOT a revolver! How simple can this be? And if it WAS a revolver, it could not be ""silenced"". I am NOT a gun expert, but even I know this basic stuff."
1,"SECOND RATE, AVERAGE","Not much more can be said about this so-called thriller. The characters are totally uninteresting and are so superficial, you'd swear you have already encountered them in countless other movies and TV shows. The lead character, the doctor with a grudge, is so predictable and corny, you'll almost root for the villians to succeed. The female woman is so lightly developed, you know that there's not much to her personality, let alone her psyche. And the plot absolutely fails to excite or thrill the reader on both the technical as well as the high tech level. Forgetable book."
1,One of the worst books you will ever have the pleasure of picking up,"If you were looking for a text book on how to write just the most awful novel possible, this might be a landmark contribution to the field of literature. I can think of few books that rival this mess for tops on my all time least favorite list. From the insane silly plot to the plastic characters, this novel sways from one disastrous misguided idea to the next.I can see that I am not alone here in tanking a book so heartily. Often I dont enjoy a book and then am startled to see that it is getting mostly four or five star reviews from my fellow critics. So it heartens me a little to see that for once, not only I but just about every other reviewer is joining hands in panning this trash to its fullest. The sad thing is that I have to give this story at least one star. 'Reaper' makes the argument that we should be able to remove that one star, its so bad that it does not even deserve that."
1,YOU NEVER REALLY GET INVOLVED IN THE STORY,"The author's choice of characters and the writing style don't amplify much suspense or interest. Instead, you feel like a detached observer and never really get involved. The lead character was so superficially developed and his love interest was so predictable, you wonder why the author even bothered. The climax was so tedious and exhausting, it leaves you wondering how this could have come about. The greatest tragedy is that the virus is brought about so well at the start of the novel but by the time the climax unfolds it has remarkably become secondary to the novel--something that shouldn't really have happened. Better plot construction, and a more carefully thought out story line could have done wonders for this book. As it is, there are many other books that are far better than this one..."
1,TOTALLY UNBELIEVEABLE,"The book is unable to generate any fear in the reader that ""this could actually happen"" so it fails to excite and thrill on that kind of level. That's not necessarily a big weakness, but when you couple that to the very inconsistent writing style and the absolutely horrible characters, you end up with a pretty ordinary and unremarkable book. The last chase scene at the end seemed like it lasted for days and days--I don't know exactly why, but I can see from other comments from other readers that we all felt that it was way overdrawn and became almost comic in nature. I'm sure that wasn't what the author had in mind. The overall premise could have been real but the author was unable to convince me. I think the idea of combining a ""medical thriller"" with a electronic high tech type of story was somewhat interesting, but this author failed to bring it about to a successful conclusion."
1,NOT A GOOD REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GENRE,"This book is seemingly one of so many medical thrillers. Unfortunately, to me, this book seemed like a rip-off of other books so that the plot, the characters, and the literary tricks were old and boring. I thought that the overall pace of the book was very uneven and that the characters were so matter-of-factly presented, that this seemed less like a novel and more like some sort of high school report. The medical aspects were never properly developed and, after spending a lot of time at the start of the book about it, the ending seemed horribly short and unjustified--did the author simply get tired of writing?"
1,NOT ONE OF THE BEST,"Very ordinary plot and very very predictable actions. The whole premise was very wild and not well thought out. Many faults in logic--never did answer why some of the victims fell victim to the ""virus"". Main characters were very shallow and seemed like cardboard characters. Ending was the pits."
1,UNREMARKABLE AND ORDINARY,"Not a very suspenseful or thrilling novel. The plot has some minor new elements, but is based on the same old formula that has been used countless times before. Typical, stereotypes abound throughout the novel so that there is little to offer that's new. The climax is long and plodding, and what makes it seem more frustrating is that you already can predict how its going to end. You might try this book if there's absolutely nothing else to read, but you won't be very excited or happy with it."
4,Exciting Techno-thriller!,"Mezrich uses just the right amount of high-tech, scifi, action, intrique, mystery, and roamce to keep you turning the pages. This will be an awesome movie!"
4,Good Book,"I really liked this book. Although it could be ""way out there"" at times, it stayed pretty much down-to-earth. It is a good book considering the vast and wide-spreading genre. I wouldn't rank it in the top 10 of it's genre, but definitely in the top 50. Go out and grab this book if you have some spare reading time and don;t know what to read. Other than that, don't make any special plans to read it because it is just another book to evenly define the genre. Despite all this, I still liked the book!"
3,Decent debut..........................Outdated sound tho',"For a 1st album this is a decent debut, but this project was put out in the fall of 2000, yet some of the songs on here sound like they were written and produced in the early 90's. Songs like ""I Can't Handle It By Myself"", ""Much Love For You"", and ""You Can Make It"" would have been hits back then, but this is the new millenium, and with it comes a new sound. They hit the spot on ""Goodtime"", ""Rough Edges"", ""Sit Back And Ride"", and my favourite ""Sindy"" though, so it wasn't all bad. Also you can hear the R. Kelly vibe on ""Slow Jam"". Not bad for a 1st try, but Brent Jones does have some talent though."
5,A classic,"This book contains translations of original articles from this period. In one case, Herbrand's theorem, there are extensive notes to repair a mistake; but most are simply presented as is, with short introductions that give some historical context. It is really wonderful to see the ideas develop. Fortunately, this book has recently been reprinted. Library copies are falling apart."
1,A historical study in itself,"While this book may have shifted the historian consensus on how decent, capitalistic, and God loving Stark's ever-shifting definition of Dark Ages was, it seems to be more of a symptom of the far-right's attempt to rehabilitate 800 years of theocratic oppression.While I understand that this attitude is currently out of favor, in 20 years when the consensus shifts back people will point to this book as the ultimate manifestation of this curious aberration in scholarly thought. Anyone who has taken a serious glimpse at commerce in the Classical era is well aware that Stark's ""faith-based capitalism"" was not even a shadow of what came before until the late-16th century (right around the time the church began to wane, curiously enough!)"
3,Kindle Features Crippled by Publisher,Well this is the first Kindle book I bought that doesn't allow Sharing excerpts via Facebook and doesn't show Highlights on the Kindle website.I'll be sure never to buy from this publisher again.
4,I didn't know that!,"This is an easy and enjoyable read as well as extremely informative. It has certainly changed my view of the ""Dark"" Ages. I can't say I am as great a fan of Capitalism as Stark is but the book does show how that system has improved life in the western world. He does write from a heavily prejudiced Catholic point of view. I did not mind that much in his book on the first centuries after the birth of Christ, but it is a little more annoying in this book."
3,Almost too good to be true,"Having lived in ultraprotestant country where one of the most popular books for young people in my childhood concerned the evil deeds of jesuits, I am not easily persuaded. I admit there is much new data which makes the concept of Dark Age silly, but it bothers me only the best side of catholicism is presented here. At one point all scientific inventions were made in Soviet Union. Now they have been done in monasteries. I would like to know why there was Luther and protestantism. The book mentions those who left protestentism and became catholists, but how about those who left the Catholic church? I would like to read more even book."
5,The Dark Ages Revisited,Great coverage of what really happened during the so called Dark Ages. After the fall of the Roman Empire innovation of all types began. It was the start of Capitalism and our Free Enterprise System. An excellent read.
3,The Victory of Reason,"While I would generally agree with Stark's findings, I am not a historian, and this work must ultimately be judged by historians. It is always a bold thing for specialists in one field to try to branch out into different discplines. As to the nature of democracy and capitalism, these things were very much founded in the monotheistic conceptions of the world (Christianity in particular) which embraced a vision of reason and moral equality that was not seen prior. All of this being said, I don't recall Jesus saying that we should accumulate wealth, and I am not sure that we ought to praise these ""successes"" as any kind of verification of the Christian faith. The radical message of Christianity was not the pursuit of self-interest, but the denial of it - signified most clearly in Christ's death on the cross. Is earthly prosperity, even if defined as longer life, better health, increased literacy, etc., the ultimate good if one truly believes in the hereafter?"
4,"The Victory of Reason : How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success","I've always wondered why the West is so much farther ahead, economically and technologically, than China, India and the Islamic world. At first I would think it was the steam engine which ushered in the Industrial Revolution which literally blasted the West way ahead of the world's other established civilizations. But why is this so? Our government institutions? Our concept of free enterprise? This book explores the contributions of thought from Christianity. Though I haven't read it all yet, I thoroughly enjoy this new angle of looking at the world as opposed to the constant attacks on the foundations of Western Civilization from people and groups who have a hate of the very Western Institutions that spawned them."
5,Don't pass this book by,"My only complaint is I wish it was longer. This is not a dry bones history book. It is a history book though and one that everyone should read. Stark goes quite contrary to the revision of history found in most college and highschool text books Every school, home school and library should have at least two copies."
5,"New Bright Light on the ""Dark Ages""","Rodney Stark shines a new bright light on the subject of the Dark Ages!I believe he builds a strong, creditable, well documented and footnoted case for the fact that Christianity, Freedom, and Capitalism all work together.I believe this a a very relevant book as we are now in a struggle with a group of people who would like to have us return to life as it was in the 7th Century.Not an ""easy quick read"", but is very thought provoking and encouraging."
4,Good enough reference...,"And not much else. The author tries to pack too much info into a single book. It did work for Lammle for the CCNA study guide. However, CCNP covers a lot more. For a recap of technologies this book is fine. If you are looking for a deeper coverage of routing protocols however, check out ""Cisco IOS for IP Routing"" by Andrew Colton (ISBN 0972286209). That book explains the mechanics of modern routing protocols, such as RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP in great detail."
2,"Helpful, but flawed","This book was helpful, but I found a number of flaws and inconsistencies. I have passed 3 of the 4 required to complete the CCNP. I always start with the Cisco Press books first, and then use this book as a review. Of the three tests I've taken, I've passed all on the first try.This book is a good way to test your understanding by spotting the statements that are wrong, partially right, or right but misleading. For example, on page 242 VTP is defined as ""Virtual Trunk Protocol."" Then at the review of terms at the end of the chapter (p269), VTP is defined as ""VLAN Trunk Protocol."" There are other cases where information is correct, but misleading.To sum up, this book is useful; but definitely do not use it as your primary study material. If you don't find yourself reading sections more than once because they seem to conflict with what you've read elsewhere, you probably don't have a thorough understanding of the material."
4,Sadomasochistic thriller!Disturbingly sexual novel..,"On a visit to the north-east of England, Dale joins a group where 'anything is possible' and soon becomes entangled in a complex web of obsession.He develops a fixation on one of the members of this unusual club - a young married man with an insatiable appetite for extreme sex. But where will it all end?explicit sadomasochistic thriller, obsessive sex for those who want it now."
3,Not as described,"This is a decent rug, but the last sentence in the description says, "".......leather handle and adjustable sling."" Well, there is no leather handle (there's a leather strip but it's not a handle) and there's no sling, adjustable or otherwise."
4,Girls Dem Suga,"If you haven't check this dude,then first listen to the ripping tune "" Girls Dem Suga"" with Mya and like me you will start to dig up anything with Beenie Man 's name on it."
3,The last album for little river band.,"The ""World Wide Love"" album was actually cobbled together from two Little River Band albums that flopped in the USA(the very under-rated ""Get Lucky"" album and ""Monsoon"").The ""song ""World Wide Love"" was added on but doesn't really sound like Little River Band.This album does have some good tracks like ""there's not another you,if I get lucky,I dream alone,the one that got away"" all from the ""Get Lucky"" album(well produced by Dennis Lambert)and ""Soul Searching,Son Of A Famous Man""and other tracks from ""Monsoon"".""Son Of a famous Man"" was actually written about John Lennon's son Julian and features Beatle style guitar backing."
2,I tied but can't connect with this one,"I recently purchased this CD after hearing Anneke van Giersbergen do guest vocals on the John Wetton/Geoff Downes collaboration Rubicon II. I am always on the lookout for new music. Anneke had outstanding vocals on that CD as she does with the Gathering on Home. However, besides the quality of her vocals, I just have not been able to connect with the music on this CD. I like a wide range of styles and genres of music, but the problem here is that the songs are not catchy in any way, and pretty much all sound alike. You can have all the talent in the world, but if the songs themselves and the delivery are marginal, you are not going to sell a lot of records. Maybe I should have started with another release by the Gathering, but this one doesn't move me in any way. I give it two stars for the talent of the vocalist."
1,It stinks!,"The Gathering has been deteriorating in stature and significance ever since the unfortunate release of ""Planet,"" probably the worst album in the past decade by anyone. This effort is nothing more than a collection of lazy folk songs interrupted by the occasional lapse of semi-consciousness. A most horrible album, an utter waste of time."
3,A Little Big Voice Looking for A Sound,"I was hoping for a Hiroshima like Gospel sound when I bought this CD used. It did not impress me on artistic merit, though it would sound sincere in Church. I would hope future releases by this artist would stretch her musical maturity and arrangements to match her obvious sincerity."
4,Actually 4 and 1/2 stars......,"Great concert, its extra special just to be able to sit in themusic room and listen and watch the one and only Joan Armatrading LIVE. I saw the show(reviewed on the CD of thissame show)in Boston last year. Having seen Joan many times asshe made her way through the BOSTON area shes never the same.Whatever music or band she tours with is alway top shelf andthis threesome play well together. Its to bad the camera workcould have been more restrained at times but its a nice DVD tofinally have. My favorites ""Kissin and a Huggin"", ""The weakness in me"", ""Everyday boy"", ""Willow"" so many highlights."
5,"Saw the concert, not the DVD...but","I saw the concert from last year's tour at the Carolina Theatre in Durham, NC. The performance, was, as usual, fantastic and Ms. Armatrading engaged the audience with her music and her wit. I am sure that this DVD will capture the same. During one song, she broke not 1, not 2 but 3 guitar strings and continued the song as if nothing had happened! An amazing performance from a favorite artist. Durham loves Joan Armatrading and I think that she knows that now."
3,Joan ! Please don't quit your day( & night) job as a singer,"I just bought this DVD a couple days ago. The music performance is good. But to my big disappointment, the filming & the editing are terrible.I use 123 inch projector screen for my home theatre system, and frankly speaking, watching this DVD really make my head spin.Another big surprise, is that when I try to blame whomever is responsible for the image work of this DVD, but only to find in the end credit.It is Joan herself who produced, directed & edited this DVD.So, Joan, please stick to your singing/songwriting talent. Hire a good director instead of doing by yourself.A word of advise for Joan's fans, please buy CD instead of DVD."
3,NOT THAT GOOD.......,"i really like joan. she plays and sings from the heart and has alot to say.sadly her support team has failed her.this concert looks like someone in the audience is filming this. handheld cameras jumping around, jerky zoom in's,camera format changes from letter box to regular screen size. i've seen bootleg concerts filmed better. sorry for being so negative but i'm sure joan will right the ship on her next dvd."
3,Wish there were more DVD's,"I first saw Joan Armatrading at the Hult Center in Eugene, OR in the mid 80's and was blown away by her performance. Ever since then, I made sure I saw every show that she played at an accessible venue.This DVD is a nice show but doesn't seem to quite capture the magic of a Joan Armatrading concert.If you've never seen her before, this will get more stars. But if you HAVE seen her personally, you'll certainly enjoy it but you'll be feeling that there's something ""more"" that you've felt at her show."
2,Why call it a DVD if its listed as a VHS tape ... hello??,"Why call it a DVD if its listed as a VHS tape ... hello??You are asking well over $50 for this product so it would seem worthwhile to at least get the product details correct for such a high price.No flames meant, just think it ought to be right.Thank you."
4,Your Fired!,"My mother loves Donald Trump. I don't know why. This doll makes her laugh. If your a fan of him, get it."
4,Easy to read,I found this book interesting and extremely easy to read... but I would like to remind people that it is often easier to tear down than to build. It seemed to me that much of this book was tearing down.
1,Wrong format,I have recently received this Alagna DVD from Nagiri Gmbh through Amazon. The format was PAL which I can't use. Nowhere in the listings from either company was a format mentioned. Only the front of the DVD was shown while the PAL format is shown on the back. Opera news has advertized the DVD which makes me think that it is available in NTSC also. None of the glowing reviews mentioned format. I have returned the DVD to Germany and am waiting for a replacement in NTSC or a refund.
1,Not in Stock,"I ordered it on 24 August, after a number of delays delivery is expected in late October. Frankly, I approved the delay just to see when they will 'fess up that they really do not have in stock.If I had known they did not really have the darn thing from the get-go I could have ordered it elsewhere.UPDATE - Delivery is now expected in late November!UPDATE 2 - Now promised for delivery by Christmas. What is that? Four months?UPDATE 3 - Shipped on 24 January; exactly five months since I ordered it."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"we gave it the six months and it did nothing for my wife. She used to be a DD before she was pregnant, and lost all of her boobs after the pregnancy,which was two years already. We thought this would bring them back. It did nothing!!!"
2,I am disapointed at the detailed strategy suggestions,"I just got the guide and have looked through the book as it pertains to comments on how to advance your career. I have been active on several of the on-line discussion groups. Most people are looking for more comprehensive instructions on how to best design cities in the different city assignments. This guide is certainly not going to guarantee that someone will work through all the issues they will face to win at these cities. I would recommend people look at the on-line forums by Sierra or Impressions to get more helpful suggestions on the more difficult assignments. Some more maps and illustrations on building designs to support different types of housing would also have been appreciated. It is not a completely useless book, but I was definitely underwelmed."
2,does not tell alot,gives you a little info but you can get most of the same online. Some of the info about the various pieces helps out
3,Not what I was expecting,"I was very disappointed in this book. While this does represent the trend of Irish history (combing sociology, anthropology, history and literature) I was hoping for much more of a history of Ireland and an economic and political look. This is really the SOCIAL transformation of Ireland and I was disappointed that very little analysis was put on economics and their tremendous growth since the European Union. If you are looking for just the history see the Oxford History of Ireland."
4,It's like this,"It is not Gypsy Moon but it is still a quality Troy Newman presentation. Sort of country, middle of the road. It's sad that this was his last offering."
5,Too Many Books....This one Stands above the rest,"The problem I have is that there are just way too many VB books to choose from. I usually will buy a book and read 500 pages only to find one new idea (when I'm lucky). It seems to me that there is just way too much noise on the VB book shelf. Mr. Connell's book definately stands apart from the crowd of me-too VB books. Mr. Connell provides acres of code with informative text and excellent design ideas that you learn something new - literally in each paragraph. This book stands head and shoulders above the rabble of VB books on the shelves. Thanks, Mr. Connell. This was well worth my hard earned money and well worth the time I invested to read it."
2,A step-by-step book but helpless,"If you know only a little of VB, this book won't help. If you want to know how ADO and real programming, it does not help, either.This book is full of step-by-step screen snapshots and hardly to retrieve useful information. It makes you feel programming in VB is simple, but you go nowhere once you tried to extend the program generated by wizards."
2,Grad Student,"I don't know what all these positive reviews are about. I found this book to ba an absolute nightmare. The directions are cluttered, code instructions are scattered, and there are no consolidated code pages so you have to keep leafing back and forth when you make an error. This is no beginner's book despite what these other reviews say. For a good beginner book buy VB Step by Step by Halvorson."
2,Not for a professional developer,"I suppose this book is excellent for a beginner/amateur visual basic developer, but if you have knowledge of the language and want to write powerful database programs, this book doesn't cut it. Most of the examples in the book focus on using the data controls and bounded controls. That works fine for simple database applications, but for real ones you'll need to write most of the database code yourself. This book just relies too heavily on vb's wizards and point and click solutions.It does say it is for beginners, I just personally felt the author skimped too much on the code-it-yourself functionality that visual basic offers. So if you are new to VB and want to get a feel for database application design, this is the book to get. If you're an experienced programmer looking for powerful database applications, I'd suggest you save your money for a more advanced book."
2,Good book but too old for year 2000,"If you wanna learn ADO technology you don't have to buy this book. Go buy ""Professional Visual Basic 6 Database Programming"".This book for year 98 or 99 is a excellennt book but not after ADO become the mainstream for programmers. These DAO old stuff from chapter 1 to 10 will waste you time for sure."
4,An outstanding tutorial for entry-level VB development!,"This was my first WROX book and I was very pleasently suprised. Coming from SAM's '21 Days' series as virtually a VB 5 beginner I found this book to be much more practical, A few steps above most VB books of the 'Hello World app' variety. With 1 1/2 years in desktop/network support and some MS Office programming I was able to wrangle an entry-level position as Web Developer with a small software shop after working thru Beginning VB 6 Database and WROX's Beginning ASP 2.0. WROX tutorials are the ONLY books I've yet found that really prepare one for the MIS working world. I'm currently finishing up Professional VB 6 Databases and Professional ASP 2.0 and am taking on increasingly complicated projects at the office. For the VB beginner this book can't be beat!"
5,Best Database Programming Book I Have Found So Far.,I have read the reviews on this book and most were Five Star. The few that were not missed the point of the book. As noted in the title this is a book on beginning visual basic programming. The book covers the new features of visual basic 6 better than the other four $40.00 dollar books I bought. Mr. Connell laid the ground work for the database beginner and some insight on how to optomize your programming. Great Book. I also bought ADO 2.0 published by WROX and it is a very detailed and comprehensive book on ADO 2.0 ---- Money well spent on both books. Good job Wrox. My only question is where do I find the PROFESSIONAL VISUAL BASIC 6 DATABASE PROGRAMMING book that is shown in the flow chart?
5,Worth every penny!!,"THIS book should be the standard used for authoring computer books. It truly is pleasing to read and use. After reading it, I felt as if it written by a human, while other similar books were crancked out by machines. It would be nice if Mr. Connell would follow it up with a book along the lines of VB Client/server. I am still looking for the book that will similarily explain beginning SQL Server to a novice like me. It anyone knows, please drop me a line."
5,This is the best computer book ever written,I am so pleasantly surprised that I had to write. This is the very best computer book I have ever read. I just want everyone to know - there is something new to learn on every page. Excellent - a satisfied reader
4,Excellent book that demands your full attention.,"As far as i'm concerned this book goes indepth on DAO and ADO. What I mean is that I believe it's not only for the beginning database programmer. For a not so beginner and yet not so intermediate programmer like myself I needed to re-read alot of the material. But man was I so appreciative when the author's point came across. Mr. Connell gives you all you'll ever need to know about DAO and a thorough run down on ADO technology. You'll understand the value of a Data Class Module as well as it's big brother the ADO dbCTL that you build in this book. Buy this book and plan to spend much time on studying and re-reading the material if your a beginner, yet also know that once you do become more familiar with the material you'll be surprised as to it's total value to any Database programmer."
3,Beginning VB 6 Database Programming (my thoughts),"The author writes in such a style that I believe he is honestly excited about Database's which is good however is a bit tiresome after a while. Additionally the author goes to lenghts to show how to build various databases however skips explanations of some of the commands shown until much later chapters. The SQL queries left me scratching my head slightly until I made it a bit further. The author apparently has written the book for someone who is truly a beginner to VB however puts off the explanation of Forms and Event Driven language features until the 4th chapter. Fortunately I am far from a beginner and could follow his wishes even if the explanations were on occasion lacking. A beginner however might be overwhealmed. This is not to say I dont recommend the book, I just wish it had been flow charted before he wrote it heck maybe some good psuedo code might have done the trick. Bottom line good book somewhat lacking tutorial structure."
3,better for beginners,"I found this book boring. The only reason I bought this book because it was needed for a college class. In my opinion, it just touches the bare necessities of database access. If you're a beginner this book could be perfect, otherwise, I would suggest something else"
2,OK but not super perfect,Did not like the part that the book covers for the most part DATA controls for MS-Access programming. Not benefecial if your are gonna be using referencial code based coding reference source.
5,"Best synopsis of ""all I need to know"" ever!","I highly recommend this book to anybody wanting to learn about Visual Basic and database programming. Connell takes you through the gamut - first how to design and normalize a tight database. He says ""the best database programs are designed, not built"" and shows exactly how to do it. Then the book covers the VB6.0 Wizards, DAO, ADO, ASP and so much more. I came to this book as a beginner and now feel I have the power and understanding to do it all! This is a must for both beginner and pro alike. There is a ton of new stuff here and acres of clear code to explain every detail. Well done!"
2,Only for Real Beginners,"This book was a waste of my money, but mostly time. I can hardly believe the Author is such a VB Pro, since there is hardly any TRUE OOP Techniques, the code is hardly an art , most of the book is devoted to an outdated and unscalable Data Control. May be good for real beginners. A lot of errors in code, Author speaks a lot of ""eliminating the dots"" , but doesn't stick to that principle in his programs."
5,Dense Packed Real World Learning,"From page 1 through to the end, John Connell knows how to hold a programmers attention. His attention to detail, understanding what is important, and conveying this in a meaningful way is his epertise. I am pleasantly surprised with this book. The writing style is real world but extremely friendly. I can see why so many people gave this a 5 star review. As technical books go, this is one of the very best."
5,Absolutely Superb!,"I purchased 3 other disappointing, similar books to this one before discovering the rave reviews on Amazon and purchased this superb book. After completing the book from cover to cover, I can quite honestly say this is not only the best book on VB databases I have ever read, but it also covers some excellent learning material on VB. Quite possibly THE best book available on the subject for beginners or new users to VB6."
4,Good Beginers Book,This book is written very well however it lacks information about connecting to other databases besides Access. Writing SQL for an Oracle database is not discussed at all. Transactional is covered but not in the depth that one would hope. Overall it is a good starting point.
4,"Good ""Getting Started"" Type of Book","This book is very well written, if a little dry at times. Step-by-step instructions for setting up SQL Server were very useful for a non-DBA like myself, and basic ADO coverage was included as well. If you're looking for in-depth, advanced knowledge, you might want to look elsewhere, but this book rocks for those of us wanting to be productive with the basic aspects of VB 6 data access utilizing ADO and SQL Sever. Coverage of stored procedures is basic--also look elsewhere if you want to gain advanced stored procedure skills. Overall, I'd recommend this book to all but seasoned VB/DB programming professionals."
5,EXCELLENT! A MUST HAVE book for VB6 & Databases!,"This book is the BEST on beginning Database programming with Visual Basic 6...and believe me, I've read them ALL! The book carries you thru creating an application with DAO, then ports it to ADO, and I really liked making the ""bullet-proof user interface""...Connell did this book so well, I would have liked to see an additional section with sample code for various other functions not related to the application created. This is an excellent book however, and well worth the purchase price!"
4,A big help,"This book was a tremendous help. I was thrown into a project at work writing database front ends for both SQL 6.5 and Oracle. With no previous VB experience, this book (and an introduction to VB 5 course) I was able to come up to speed quickly. I have also been able to write a few programs at home using MS Access as my back end."
3,This book tends to loose beginners,"If you are a seasoned Programmer this book should be pretty easy to follow. The true ""beginner"" will be lost in the dust before finishing the third chapter however."
5,When is the next one coming out?,"Rather than go on about the merits of this great book - many others have beat me to it - I want to find out when Connell's next book is coming out. Mr. Connell is an excellent teacher - he presents complex comcepts in a clear well thought out manner. He is clearly an expert. So, when will WROX release another book by this outstanding author?"
5,A Great starter for anyone wanting to I/F VB to databases,This book provides a good grounding into the fundamental aspects of developing a solid user front end to any database applications. All of the latest techniques that come with VB6 are covered from ADO through SQL to the latest in active X ADO and ASP techniques.This book uses a good example throughout (address book) that all readers will understand and John shows you professional programming techniques in a well written beginners book.
5,Brilliant comic; love the treasury!,"I owned the original comic collections, but we still wanted the treasury for the color comics. Get Fuzzy is the only thing that can come close to filling the void left by Calvin and Hobbes. I live in a household of just two people, but both of us have elements of Bucky Katt and Satchel in us, and the relationship Rob Wilco has with is cat and dog roommates applies not only to people with pets, but to any family unit.I keep this by the bedside to read whenever I have a free moment between other novels. It makes a great gift...I've given it to people who have never heard of Get Fuzzy who were instantly converted. Try it out on any Calvin and Hobbes fan."
5,An Excellent Strip,"I have long been a fan of Calvin and Hobbes and for a time, it was the only strip that would make me laugh out loud. Get Fuzzy has quickly joined that elite rank for me. There isn't a strip out there today that's better. Bucky's antics are hilarious and Rob's attempts to cope with his two crazy and erratic pets are beyond funny.This book is one of the better collections and has many, many great strips in it. I've read it more than once and have never got tired of entering Conley's extremely funny world."
5,Great Get Fuzzy Collection,"Book is great, has all the great strips featured in the local newspaper and more. If you like the comic you won't be dissapointed in the book! 5 stars!"
3,A New Perspective,"More than anything Mr. Edelman is a good salesman. His books are a soft sell of his investment services firm. I enjoyed reading his take on real estate investment and of course he thinks more highly of stocks and bonds. (Duh, what service does he sell?) The book's reference guide style is Ok although some readers may not like it. It was worth checking it out from the library but it's not an investment bible and there's no need to buy it."
1,Wrote the book to fill some pages,"I have read many money books but this has to top my list as one to hold up the coffee table. Although there are many traditional money concepts in the book, this book was written for someone who makes at least $100,000 a year. It seemed he was more concerned about how to do better on your taxes, and not how to make money in the long run, and keeping it as a long term goal."
5,Huh what?,"I found a review supposedly by a school teacher from Florida complaining about middle income brackets of $54,000. He goes on to to say that he won't see that in 35 years.I work for a school system in Pennsylvania and I don't know how I'd live on only $54,000/per year. I also know people in Florida who are making 6 figure incomes. One guy I know made over $50,000 last month.Don't blame your profession, your location or Ric Eedelman. Blame the guy you see when you look in the mirror!"
1,waste of money,dont bother. was helpful in the real estate boom but this type of advice let to the melt down.
4,helicopters,"I would say this helicopter is for a younger child. My child is 4 and has a helicopter addiction, but I think the story to this book is a bit basic. Nice pictures. Informative.Just for a younger kid."
2,One Big Problem,"This compost tumbler does a great job of turning your kitchen scraps into rich compost, however, there is one big problem. After the first complete cycle the latch that holds the lid in place started coming loose and has not worked properly ever since. When the tumbler reaches the bottom of a turn, the lid falls off and spills the decaying material all over the ground. Its messy and difficult to clean up. I have tried making a latch replacement myself with modest success. It is clear that the maker of this product has decided not to solve the problem, since reviewers here and on other sites have mentioned it and nothing has been done. An excellent product with a fatal flaw. Unless you are prepared to deal with the mess, avoid purchasing The Envirocycle Composter."
4,Worth it!,"It is definitely a stand out. Cleverly designed, clean in function, blends nicely in green color. Remains to be seen how fast you get the compost. Logically, you would need two because I do not think the content degrades quickly, especially in the winter. So far I like it."
3,too soon to tell,"I received my first Envirocycle in July, the second late August. I'm not sure how well I'll like them! It's difficult to get the correct balance of greens and browns. They really do get hot inside, especially in the 80 and 90 degree days we've had so much of, so in that respect, they should work. When one is 3/4 full, it's difficult to turn and rocking back and forth doesn't seem to mix the contents very effectively. Ask me again in a year!"
5,Real history is in this book.,"Being a retired physician, I have always been drawn to medical history.I first heard of this book some years ago when it first came out, when the author was interviewed on NPR.Since it's not new, this book may now be owned economically, second hand from amazon.The history of the invention of ether, preceeded by nitrous oxide, is very fascinating.The personalities of the discoverers, both American and unfortunate, are carefully described in a fascinating way.There was also an interesting tidbit for me. Crawford Long, a physician in Athens, Georgia, later claimed to have been the first to employ general anesthesia.I happen to be retired in a community not far from Atlanta, which is famous for hosting a hospital named Crawford Long.The little tidbit is that a foreign newspaper, learning that Long was from Athens, erroneously informed its readers that he lived in Greece!"
4,Entertaining History.,"As an Anesthesia Provider, I found Ether day to be educational and also entertaining. It is an enjoyable and quick read."
1,A serious chemical error,"The book seems OK up to page 51, where it loses all credibility. After discussing the virtues of nitrous oxide as a party gas (the chapter is titled ""The Hilarity Before Ether Day""), the author gives her instructuions for synthesizing it. The problem, and potential tragedy, is that her recipe produces notrogen dioxide (NO2), not laughing gas (nitrous oxide, N2O). Nitrogen dioxide is very poisonous. Anyone who inhales a single breath deeply will probably die, and the death will be particularly unpleasant.If anyone you care about buys the book, warn about page 51!"
5,Great comeback album by Jeff Carson!,"I thought this album was awesome! Song choice was important since Jeff doesn't write much. His song choice was right on the money! It is rather heavy on the ballads, but the ballads are very good. The best of these is ""Real Life"", which is the title cut. Right behind it is the other ballads, including ""My One And Only Love"", ""What's Not To Love"", ""It Wouldn't Kill Me"", and the killer cut, ""Scars and All"". The up-tempo stuff is really good too. I liked all of them, ""I Almost Never Loved You"", ""Shine On"" (A awesome song of inspiration and hope, especially given the recent New York tragedies), ""Where Did I Go So Right"", and ""Divine Intervention"". This is a very good album. Keep it going, Jeff!"
4,Real Life is something else,This CD was just what I hoped. I loved Jeff Carson on the radio in the 90's and all this time later I introduced my husband to his music. Now there is another rabid fan out there. :o) Real Life is a beautiful song. And I love that Jeff is a Christian man.
5,These are great,"They worked out very well. I have burned dozens of them so far without a problem using my Dell 8x CD burner. They're very handy, as they're only about 3 inches wide and fit into my pocket easily."
1,din't work,This cd's dind't work on a hp cd-writer 8200 series the driver say than ther is not disk inside of her... i'm very dissipointed
3,Syn - 'A Matter of Time' (Clear View),"A so-so mid-'90's post rock {which is how I would describe it} title that I guess this here is the band's sole release. To avoid any and all confusion, this NOT the psych / progressive band from the late '60's featuring Yes members guitarist Peter Banks and bassist Chris Squire. Tunes here I sort of liked checking out were ""Love On My Side"", ""Last Night"" and ""Please Be There"". Nothing too special, just okay."
3,Syn But Not The Syn,"Though very listenable, this CD is not by the same progressive rock pioneers known as the Syn with Chris Squire and Steve Nardelli. There are apparently two totally different bands with the same name. The original band was founded in the mid 1960s."
4,"Great little tool, not perfect (yet)","I keep one of these in my pocket all the time, great for looking at tags on equipment in dark corners, reading menus in dark restaurants, etc. When I'm hiking, I always have it with me.The only problem? I'm a guy, I keep it in my pocket. It's always getting turned on by accident, until my wife tells me ""you have something glowing in your pocket"". If the manufacturer can come up with a switch that is not turned on so easily by accident, this will be a 5 star product.Don't get me wrong, I love the product, and have given at least ten as gifts."
5,Great collection,"Mostly the well known artists are included, but for those just getting interested in the Blues, this is a great all-star showcase of who to check out. Also, I really liked the illustrations."
2,Not good for heavy dough,Sturdy handy but removable scraper head is weak. Mine broke in half while mixing dough for a loaf of bread before kneading.
2,Disappointing,"I bought one of these puzzles (World Animals) for my after school program for elementary kids thinking they would love the extra challenge of finding the hidden animals. The overall quality is typical of lower cost puzzles, so I have no complaints about that. And it is a perfectly fine 100 piece puzzle of the world. However, the print quality was so poor that even with the enclosed magnifying glass, it was impossible to make out any ""hidden animals"". Without the glass, they were virtually invisible - not just hard to see - impossible. With the glass they looked like smears in the ink. At least I think that was one of the animals. My 15 year old son and I put the puzzle together and searched for an hour and couldn't find anything that looked like an animal - just smears of paint in vaguely animal-like shapes scattered here and there. I think the company needs to boost the print resolution considerably. In theory, it was a great idea, and I was sorry to be disappointed."
2,"Tiny, not as pictured","The helmet we received was not exactly as pictured. The ""crown"" part was more of a visor with a noseguard. And the sides had ear slots. However, neither of these made any difference because the helmet was so tiny. It barely perched on my son's head, and there was no way the visor was going to come down. Maybe this would have fit a 5 year old. Sadly, we had to return it. See my photo in the product's image gallery to see what was received."
4,Nice costume prop,"Was trying to make a roman soldier for a church production and this was a good choice. It is small, so must be for a child."
1,too small to wear,This is way too small to wear. this product is for kid will not fit on the adult. i m going to return thsi item
5,My son absolutely LOVES this Han Solo!!,"The item was shipped very quickly, an indication of a great seller! It was a brand new toy, still in the original packaging, and my seven year old son (who loves Star Wars!), loves this toy so much! He plays with it all of the time and shows it to anyone who walks into our home!"
2,Do not like the smell,I tried this because I enjoy the Fresh Grass scent so much that I thought I would like this -- not so. Now I am stuck with an expensive bottle that I really do not care for at all.
2,A disappointment,"I've enjoyed every other Douglas Coupland novel I've read (Generation X, Shampoo Planet, Microserfs), but I am starting to wonder if Coupland is now slipping. This is a man who used to have his finger on the pulse of American youth, but he now seems to have lost it. This book just seems like a pale imitation of something he wrote ten years ago and pretty far from reflective of today's culture. It drove me crazy that he kept referring to himself throughout the entire novel. As if twenty-somethings today really sit around talking about Douglas Coupland novels. Get real! That above all made me realize that this man really has no clue how people that age act or think. The story was ridiculously boring and the attempts to make the parents wacky were pathetic (Helen Fielding did a better job with the wacky mom character in the Bridget Jones books!). Save your money and read one of Coupland's older books."
2,Douglas Coupland is better than this-at least he used to be...,"It was all I could do to finish this book. I'm a Coupland fan from way back, and this was just so weak. His earlier work is so much better, it's like this book is a shell of his earlier, better books. The protagonist having a pot-dealing mother? Not funny. Coupland showing up in the book as a minor character? Not funny. The bizarre almost-blank pages with meaningless words and phrases, as well as pages and pages of numbers? Not funny. This book? Not worth the time. There were a few (very few) funny moments, but they were rare. Let's hope DC can do better next time."
1,Ugh,"I really can't stand this book.This is my first encounter with Coupland and I have to say it could not have been a more negative experience.The self-references are insanely narcissistic. His characters are a collection of modern personality quirks complied haphazardly into ""people."" They are neither funny nor believable, just annoying. Even the title itself, J-Pod, is smug. I'd imagine Coupland concocted the title before the plot leading to its pointless nature.I get the feeling Coupland thinks this book is much more clever than it actually is. Do not bother with it."
2,"Oh dear. You can do so much better, Douglas","I'm afraid I'm with most of the other reviewers. jPod is not up to scratch.The plot's ludicrous (and really rather dull).The characters are barely two-dimensional. I think the relationship between the main narrator, Ethan, and Kaitlin sums it up [SPOILER]: Early in the book Ethan lets on he's interested in Kaitlin (with no real detail). There are a few exchanges; he says ""I like you"" and in the next chapter they're boyfriend and girlfriend. A little later they're living together. Just like that. I'm afraid I didn't believe in a single character, so I didn't care what happened to them.There are too many technical errors to have any tech-cred (I spotted three or four high-school-science-level stuffups and I'm no coder, so I have no idea whether the code bits are legit).There are a few bits of clever dialogue, which are really the only redeeming features.And I'd so enjoyed Douglas' blog on the NY Times..."
2,When An Author Inserts Himself Into A Novel,"it is usually a recipe for disaster and I must say that the recipe works all too well. I can actually see Coupland, on a weekend bender as he scrawled out this drivel on an Etch N Sketch. (Imagine if I wasn't a huge fan Doug).The story is not plausible from the first page and while there parts in the book that will make you smile, you would be better off skipping to the last page of the book, read the final line, and save your time and money for his next adventure.The only good news is the book is printed on non acid paper so if I decide to use it for kindling I would be doing no further harm to the enviroment as already way too many trees died for this novel.Bottom Line - If you must read it, wait 3 months and buy ft for a penny as I am sure there will be multiple listings for it in the Used Section of this website."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"Many clever ideas, as usual. And funny. But a lot of filler (OK, the primes and pi, we got it, but wouldn't a page be enough?). More seriously, I don't get where Coupland is heading, this book is so different from Hey Nostradamus and Eleanor Rigby. I prefer the cynical and funny Coupland to the mystical one, but this one is really too thin"
4,be careful if reading in public...,"I read my first D.C. book in 1992 when I graduated college-you guessed it: I'm a Gen X-er! I can't believe there are all the bad reviews of this book-it is classic Coupland: satyrical, disturbing, comedic, a parody of life that could hit home! I have been laughing (out loud), giggling and guffawing on a regular basis. Therefore, be careful if reading this book in public... people may stare!"
4,"Addict the boss to heroin. Huh. Never thought of that,","This is a fun, nauseating read. It's mostly a story of amoral, sympathetic, intelligent, high-tech characters, and the high-jinks they get up to. Ultimately, it's a sad commentary on well, Canada at least, and Western Civilization, at most.In this book's world, there's no longer any absolute good, just what's good for you (and, optionally, yours).This book, more than anything I've read this year, shows me just how decadent Western culture has become, and how much Islam deserves to supplant us."
2,A story about nothing,"Jpod is set in a fictional computer game company world. The story's protagonist, Ethan, is a programmer working on the company's next skateboarding game.The story twists and turns from there - to the delight of no one really. His boss insists on adding a talking turtle to the game, becomes infatuated with Ethan's mom, is sold into slavery in China, becomes addicted to heroin, and returns a better manager for his addiction - or due to his addiction.The main story points are too bizaar and complex to condense into a review. The cast of characters are far more interesting than the main protagonist; but the reader only gets to see them through the protagonist's eyes.This book is like Fight Club without the witty dialogue or fight scenes. If you thought a computer progamer's life was dull, you were right."
1,Couplands worst,"I've loved all of the other books he's written, but I wanted to mail this one back to him and ask him for my money back. I was bored and annoyed with most of the book, waiting for something good, waiting for it to get better, but it never happened. Get it at the library if you think you have to read it. save your money, don't waste your time."
4,"Summer fun, with bite","I loved Microserfs so I was skeptical when I first heard about jPod. Would old characters return? Would their 90s optimism face off against the hardships of 21st century post-boom life? I was happy to discover that this new book is a fresh start with a whole different group of techies.The book is hilarious and hits so many bullseyes. But for me it was also an unnerving, faux uncritical look at today's distracted, greedy, amoral, hyperdrive culture where there is only I, only me, only my problems, and only my money. Douglas Coupland himself throws himself into this blender, casting himself as a narcissistic celebrity author who manipulates lives at will. Are we not all heading towards a global reality show in which everyone is playing for keeps? There's a sharper edge between the lines of this book.A great read for the summer of 2006... of course, until the return of The Apprentice -- L.A. VERSION!"
3,"Funny, funny, funny... but disappointing after Microserfs.","Such a disappointment after Coupland's Microserfs.Hilarious throughout, I really did want to love JPod, hoping it would be some kind of sequel to Microserfs (which I suppose it is in a way). However, it was nothing like I expected.The one, single aspect that made me give this book such a low score? The incessant self referencing throughout the novel. Not only do the characters discuss Coupland himself... Coupland is a full-blown character in the novel too! This, I could not stand.(Would have given it 2, but it _is_ still funny as hell in places.)"
1,Not fun,"Why should I spend my money to carry around thirty or so pages of random numbers and digits of pi (with an error inside, so they're not even good for cryptography) just because Coupland felt he needed to use filler when he had nothing interesting to write?Predictable. Stereotyped. Not fun. The portrait of twenty-something geeks in the game development industry might be accurate, but totally uninteresting. What a letdown."
3,I haven't read Microserfs ... yet.,"I've plowed through every Coupland novel excepting Microserfs and, after reading some of these reviews, will be purchasing my copy shortly.Its been several months since I finished JPod, so my review will be righteously arcane. It'll also be brief, because it seems the book has already been discussed to death.I'll just say this:The book fulfilled my expectations as an entertaining vehicle featuring the usual qualities I look for in a Coupland book. Namely, vicious rhetoric peppered with ridiculous, obsessively crafted weavings of wit that we all wish was off the cuff.That's all. And yeah, I miss the Life After God sensibility too."
5,Best Coupland I have read,"Although it was the only one.I then read Gen x and Microserfs. All good reads, I even send copies of JPod to a few friends"
1,Bottom of the barrel,"This book made me hate Douglas Coupland. Hate him not only for his lazy narrative style, but him as a writer, for writing such an stupid novel. Clearly, he decided to see what would happen if he wrote an entire novel drunk."
5,Best Coupland novel yet,"This is quite easily the best novel I have read in some time and as a reference librarian I read a fair amount of literary fiction. It is farcical and crazy but the language, perspective and insight into todays culture is so unique and fresh. It was an incredible ride. I laughed hard. This is a must read for anybody looking for something different and dare I say it - cutting edge."
3,Does Anyone Get It?,"Douglas Coupland, clever guy. JPod, clever title, does anyone get it? What sense does that title make, did he pull it out of thin air? Or is it because he is from Vancouver, BC? ""Vancouver, BC?"" you ask, ""what has that got to do with it?"" Well, I'm glad you asked - There are Killer Whales (aka Orcas) off the Canadian coast and they live in groups called pods. Each pod is named after a letter in the alphabet - JPod is the group of Killer Whales that lives in the Georgia Straight, just off Vancouver, BC. Clever guy, Douglas Coupland."
3,"good novel, not great.","I liked this book very much, not as good as some of Coupland's others but entertaining none the less. Explored important and interesting themes, the desensitization of people through the onslaught of media and media options, materialism, violence etc.JPod was a very funny and easy read and is difficult to put down. The only real problem I had with the book is that it is utterly forgetable. The novel leaves you the moment you close the book. Fun, but not core shattering."
2,Not even close to Microserfs,"This was disappointing to say the least. I was very excited at the concept of a microserfs ""sequel"" and jumped in with both feet. However, right there on page one, a reference by the characters that they're in a Douglas Coupland novel. That was the biggest sticking point for me, that he had to bother putting himself into the novel, or some alter-ego. I've read them all (I think). and this one just seems quite easily the weakest of them. Bottom of the Coupland stack, glad I got it out of the library. Disjointed story even for Coupland, shallow characters, and too many pages of non-text with no decent context. Microserfs has been read and passed around, this will simply be returned to the library, maybe even late to keep people from having to suffer it."
4,Coupland's best novel in years...,"I got in an advanced copy of this and thought, ""man, this better not be as bad as his last couple books."" For some reason, I always make myself read Coupland's novels. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is his best novel in years. It maybe one of his best ever. Good job, Douglas. I was losing hope. Its your typical Coupland characters. Most of the book focuses around video game programmers and pop culture references. The references seem in this novel to be more like literary devices than gimmicks like in some of his other works. What he's been trying to do for years, finally clicks and seems to work in this one. Even when he writes himself into the novel, it works pretty well. I know what you're thinking-- ""oh, god... no he didn't..."" but it actually works. Though, I do have to say, I'm so tired of authors doing this. It might be the last time I'll take it seriously."
2,This book blows.,"I have not read any other of Douglas Coupland's books. I would say that the best part of this book would be the cover art. All the characters are unlikable and it is as if Douglas Coupland tried to make the characters as cynical as possible to show how edgy he is. I could just see him as he was writing himself into his book, taking a break from it, reclining back in his chair, his hands together saying, ""Heh.....these characters don't care about anything. A perfect portrayal of the Vancouver area's hip apathy. God, I'm a genius."" Then he hugged himself.The pages with random text were very refreshing, but the rest is boring crap that just leads you in a big nerdy circle. If you love flaky, whiny, and downright annoying characters who you want to punch in the face then you'll love this book."
3,Interlude in Death...,"The puzzle was great fun. The story classic JD Robb. Unfortunately, the puzzle isn't necessary to solve the mystery. This isn't the only time I've had this happen. I make it a habit to put the puzzle together before reading the story."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I was really excited to find this and purchase it as a gift for my mom, but was disappointed that the version of the story was seriously abridged from the original novella. I was expecting a small paperback novella, but instead, this has just a small paper pamphlet."
3,X Files still good at season 7,"This season had some humor in it. It also includes episodes ""Cops"" and ""Millennium"". This is a just plain entertaining and worthy of the X Files collection. I have the first through the eighth seasons on DVD and enjoy every episode.I'm also a ""Fringe"" fan and The X files started it on fox. Millennium tried but some idiot(s)decided it wasn't any good (but it was the best TV show with Lance Henrickson's best work). Check out Millenium.If you have not seen the X Files, Check out the series. The regular ""filler episodes"" outside the alien conspiracy are just as fun. They are stand alone mini-movies. In my opinion, the reason why the X Files films did not do so well is because they already used the same quality for the TV show. They can't top what's already been their best work."
5,Season Seven is Great!,"I don't care what anyone says, The X-Files seventh season is one of the best. It features some of the best stand-alone episodes in the show's history. Just look at X-Cops, Je Souhaite, Hungry, or Rush and you will see what I mean.The mythology episodes weren't that great, but the other ones make up for it. Plus this is the last season with Mulder and Scully together. Along with seasons 1-6, every fan of the show should buy this set."
4,"A Clever, Humorous ""Monster-of-the-Week"" Episode","In the x-files there were basically two types of episodes: the ""monster of the week"" episodes that were random adventures whose story primarily only existed in that single episode, and the ""canon storyline episodes"" that weaved in storylines, sub-plots, and themes and suspenses throughout the entire series. This was definitely a Monster of the Week episode, about a man with anomalously good (but tricky) luck. I like Rube Goldberg machines and thought this was quite clever, albeit slightly quirky at some parts."
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!","By far the worst season of the X-Files. Yes it was the last full season with Duchovny, but with his embarassing writing directing skills of ""Hollywood AD"" second worst episode only to the ""Genie"" episode, I thank God aliens abducted him. I mean, how many times now has Scully or Mulder died or almost died? In first episode he is mad as a hatter and by the second he's ""all well"" again. At least when Scully had cancer, it followed it through. This season boasted some of the most unwatchable episodes ever imagined with no continuity. Yes X-cops was amusing, and I own seasons 1-6 but when this came around I couldn't wait to get rid of it."
2,"Yes, but not quite.","I did not like this season at all, it seems that they ran out of things to do. Te first three disks are complete filling, the episodes are dull, the argument nonexistent and that great anticipation of the unexpected of the previous seasons is lost. If you have the first six seasons, by all means and for the sake of ""getting them all"" do buy it, but is definitely not one of the best."
5,Simply the Best Show Ever!,"The X-Files spun nearly a decade and if it hadn't been for David Duchovny leaving the show, it would've ran much longer. The seventh season, Duchovny's last full season, was the last season that had a lot of good episodes. In this box set you'll get:The Sixth ExtinctionThe Sixth Extinction II: Amor FatiHungryMillenniumRushThe Goldberg VariationOrisonThe Amazing MaleeniSigns and WondersSien Und ZietClosureX-CopsFirst Person ShooterTheefEn AmiChimeraall thingsBrand XHollywood ADFight ClubJe SouhaiteRequiemFor any fan, this is a must-have DVD set! Its loaded with DVD extras and every episode is in widescreen. I can't wait!"
3,5 stars for technical quality...,"Maybe a 2 for the content. Season 7 is in my opinion the worst year of the show as a whole. The highlights mentioned in Amazons review were exactly the ones I would have chosen as the best episodes. Hungry, Goldberg Variation, Theef, etc, are among my faverite episodes of the entire series, and there were a few other notable classics as well, but Season 7 still lands at the bottom of the pile for me. It's a good set for the extras, like all the other X-Files DVD sets, and to complete your collection I say buy it, it is a quality set from a technical viewpoint. But for a casual fan looking for a first set to buy, I'd recomend the first season. For a more seasoned fan looking for great episodes, I'd go with Season 5 for the sheer diversity of concepts and creativity, not to mention some great mythology episodes."
2,"Flashes of Brilliance, But Only of Monsters","The occasionally awesome episodes, too far and few between, is what kept viewers like me hanging on until the end...and past it (Robert Patrick, no match for Duchovny). X-Cops is one of my favorite eps of all time, though we never even get to see an actual monster (I'd love to see the hornet man, ha ha), and Je Souhaite is just hilarious, especially when she pops a ranting and swearing Mulder into Skinner's office during a meeting. Genius, though the end is obviously predictable.The resolution (if one can call it that) of Mulder's raison d'tre is horrible, and no real end at all for such a strong storyline. To never meet his sister after all of this time was a ripoff, IMO, just one of many perped by Carter."
5,It's the X-Files,"There's not much to say about this. Either you love the X-Files or you don't. Some seasons were better overall than others, but I love them all. Excellent dvd set."
5,Classic X-Files Thrills,I'm never disappointed with the X-Files. Couldn't get by these winter months in between season premieres without this.
3,"Going Downhill Fast, But Still Worth Owning","By the time we come to Season Seven, the show has past its peak and is noticeably on the downhill run. Still, there are several stand-alone episodes that are not to be missed. I would buy it for ""X Cops"" alone. That said, the episodes are:The Sixth ExtinctionThe Sixth Extinction II: Amor FatiHungryMillenniumRushThe Goldberg VariationOrisonThe Amazing MaleeniSigns & WondersSein Und ZeitClosureX CopsFirst Person ShooterTheefEn AmiChimeraAll thingsBrand XHollywood A.D.Fight ClubJe SouhaiteRequiem"
2,The worst season of xfiles but still great,"I was amazed to see in the first few episodes that the season had still a lot to give. However, as the episodes progressed it became clearly that xfiles had reached to its end and from that point on there was something missing. There are 5 or 6 episodes that are very good indeed but again it is a dissapointment to see so many mediocre or even bad episodes when there where none such in the previous seasons."
4,190's over mother russia,"another excellent book covering the luftwaffe aces over russia. the book features excellent photos, some brilliant colour plates of different paint schemes and lots of detail on the men who flew there. the costs in men and machines was huge and there are many tragic tales within the pages of this book."
3,Disappointed in this one,"I have quite a collection of these Osprey series books. I am not disappointed in the historical content of the topic. All the ""Aces"" book series heve been satisfying both the historian on the men who flew them and modeler with nice color profiles of the aircraft. It's nice to put a visual man and machine together. I sent to Amazon for this book without question expecting the same content, and was taken by surprise when I received it. At first I thought maybe the book was missing all the color profiles. I went back to the book reviews to see if anyone made a comment about it and no one did.As an equal historian and model builder, I would not have purchased this book at the $16.00 discount price if I knew it lacked the color profiles. I have other book references about these Aces in greater detail including black & white pictures. Two star loss for me without color profiles, what could have been a paperback book at $8."
4,Definetly Not A Low Quality Lens!,"As a semi-pro Photo Buff I've used many add-on lenses.I personally have owned and used Tiffen Lenses on more than several occassions including this model.I personally tried this Lens on three different cameras a Sony,Kodak and Canon models.I did not experience any blurriness as another reviewer here mentioned he did.However,I totally disagree with his assessment of the build quality for in that regard it is Cheap in cost only."
2,Tiffen doesn't automatically mean quality,"This is a cheap lens, so you don't go into it expecting much. It works, but has some serious blurry halo problems. In retrospect, it would have been better to wait a little longer and get the Century Optics lens."
4,Gruesome Luck,"This book is simply amazing. Kovaly has had the most terrible luck imaginable (jailed in a Nazi Concentration Camp AND Stalinist Prague). She describes her life, as well as the inherent similarities/problems with Stalinism and Nazism. If you want a WWII & Cold war historical account, a gripping biography or a description of totalitarian regimes, this book is for you."
4,Moving story,"Having been to Prague several times, it was very interesting to read this story. The family were victims of both Nazism and Communism - quite tragic, but written without bitterness. Recommended."
5,Its the story that plays in my head whenever tragedy befalls me & gives me the strength to get through it.,"I read this about 6 years ago when it was assigned in one of my undergrad classes. There are enough online reviews for you to read about the plot and like. Rather I want to tell you how her voice has stuck with me. I think of her ability to see the slivering when everything is just gray, and her amazing capacity to keep going. Whenever I think I can't go on, this death/or lost/ or series of unfortunate events as shattered the very last of my will I remember her words. I highly recommend it. I regally give this as a gift, I know I'm not just giving someone a powerful story, but really I'm giving someone a packet of extra strength for when they need it most in life."
5,What great research - and what a fun book this is!,"Ok. While on the road, I used this book to conduct trivia contests. The guys I am with, are Elvis fans and they always try to prove that they know Elvis more than I. So this book put an end to that!But I will say this: I TOO WAS WRONG on many occasions! I never knew 50-60% of the information that was listed in this book -- and I thought I knew a LOT! So this is an educational book beyond any Elvis fans' expections or knowledge!I think this will soon become an Elvis Bible to the fans and Elvis world - if it's not already!Remarkable from the first page to the last!"
5,How can it not be good? It is written by Jim Curtin,"If anyone knew Elvis or has a better knowledge of Elvis, I am not aware. Jim is not only a collector of Elvis Memorabilia, but he has studied, and was a personal Friend of Elvis. What more could you ask for. He lives, talks, breathes Elvis. Any Book that he would write is out of Love for Elvis."
4,Good for the price,"The switch is a little fragile, but for the price I paid, I didn't expect this to be a great product. All in all, I think it's good enough."
3,Functional.,"I bought this for my EX wife to use, but she never did. It appears to be made well and function as advertised.Not sure about how it will hold up over time. It's an indoor device."
3,gets the job done,"Not much to say, it gets the job done and is affordable but its nothing special. I did see the same product at a local dollar store though which kind of saddened me, but my fault for not shopping around a little more."
1,worthless junk,"This A/B switch was defective out of the package. Even if it wasn't defective, it was so poorly made I doubt it would have worked more than a few days."
5,"Good value, serves it purpose",Simple coaxial A/B switch does what it's suppose to do. What more could you ask for. Two cables in and one cable out..simple as that.
4,They work with reservation,"A good bargain and they do work, I bought 5 of them. Only issue is, occasionally the resistance builds and you have to toggle the switch so it will make clean contact. Not an issue really, just be aware if you start having dropouts this is probably the issue. Have to toggle the switch once a week to prevent it. My setup is kinda weird and I don't use the switch very often. Beats paying 20 bucks for the one at radio shack. Recommended."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this to replace the OEM battery (Fuji-branded NP-80) in a Fuji digital camera. This battery apparently is not a replacement for that battery as it will not charge at all. It looks exactly the same, but even after several hours on the charger, it won't even power up the camera (the camera does work, using the OEM battery, just not for very long)."
4,2 year old son loves these books,"My son loves trucks these days and got these truck board books for his 2nd birthday a few weeks ago and he loves them. He did manage to separate the book because it's a board book and he likes to snap the pages around but even in pieces he still loves to read it, look at it and have it read to him. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because there aren't many pages to them, but this doesn't matter to kids who like the same few pages read over and over anyway."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!,"Mighty Prevailing Prayer is a fantastic read! It explains in detail what must done in order to gain the answer in prayer. It, and The Complete Works of E.M. Bounds on Prayer are two of the most comprehensive volumes I've ever read on prayer. If you want to know the secrets of how to prevail with God, and over satan, then this book is a must have; it comes highly recommended!!!"
5,One of the best books on prayer that I've read,"I really enjoy many books on Christian prayer. I have books on prayer and this one stands out as one of the best that I've read. Wesley Duewel does a great job defining prayer, encouraging prayer and helping to motivate you to take advantage of the wonderful privilege of prayer. Throughout the book Wesley uses many quotes from well-known Christians and encouraging stories to help illustrate his points. I also own and have read Duewel's other book on prayer ""Touch the World Through Prayer"". Although both books are very good, I liked this one a little better out of the two. This book had so much substance and encouragement, that I definitely plan to read it more than once. Highly recommended."
5,"Really Excellent, but not for beginners","For anyone like myself who is quite familar with Visual Basic, but wants his or her hand held during the steps of creating your first, real live multi-tiered object-oriented application, this is a great book.And 99% of the source code (which you can download from Wrox.com) is actually correct and compiles! I got about 2/3 of the way through the book before I found the first error, and it was minor (a typo)."
2,It's the same as the VB5 version.,Why didn't he metion anything about ADO recordset marshaling. Why he use the same technique as VB5. His previous book was excelent I think he should put more effort to use the VB6.0 new features. I asked Wrox about it and till today I didn't got any answer.
1,Just Changed the Title,"I too agree with another reader's review. It appears they reprinted the same book, but they put 6.0 in the title. The only topic I could find that was different was the page or two dedicated using ADO recordset as a way to marshall data between objects.If you don't have the 5.0 book, I would suggest buying it since the author has a good design for setting up N-tier application, however I disagree on the method used to marshall data between components."
2,Book for beginners,"Despite being called as 'enterprise design and implementation', this is a book for beginners. Example (video store) is for amateurs, and all database is done on Access. Even author admits, that design is in fact two-tier. And you cannot find 'stored procedure' even in index - very interesting understanding of 'business objects':) I saw a bunch of people on interviews - immediately after person starts talking about projects like mentioned one, you may definitely suspect the applicant just finished some short course or read this book. As a book for beginners, it might be nice, but should have a little bit different title :)"
2,Not applicable for future technologies,"Not applicable when you are using SQL Server 2000 or other databases that return XML results, which is considerably faster and provides cleaner code than the one provided here."
2,Wordy & obtuse,"Don't judge a book by its volume. There are much better ones for VB/COM systems, (Rofail, et. al.; Swartzfager, et. a.) This book was a bg disappointment."
2,Not what you would be led to expect...,"After reading Beginning VB Objects by Peter Wright (a wonderful book that will refresh you on core VB and object-oriented design), I decided to look at Visual Basic 6.0 Business Objects. It was repeatedly recommended throughout Beginning VB Ojects as its sequel. it was touted as containing detailed definitions and descriptions on such subjects as apartment-modeled threading and such. Well, after looking it over, the one paragraph on apartment-model demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of threading and basic operating system concepts. The author blurs the distinction between processes and threads. You can get a better grasp and more accurate definition/description on threading by reading the free articles on devx.com. Hopefully the demonstrations on business objects will be better, but come on, using a video store as an analogy???"
2,Some good core concepts but not Object-Orientated.,"Some good concepts are introduced but this book certainly can't claim to be object-orientated.There is little or no treatment of interfaces, and many of the examples use module functions where objects would have been more approriate.Worst of all, a suggestion is to disable all buttons on a window until the user enters valid information!!!! Not a very practical idea.Overall, dissappointing, and it certainly leaves out a lot of information needed to implement any reasonably sized n-tier application."
4,"Good quality cable, snagless feature not as expected","In general, this cable offered quality as I expected from a Belkin product.Only a minor reservation about the snagless feature. I expected a complete flexible plastic enclosure over the plastic plug-end tab. This cable only offers a flexible wall on each side of the tab, but not over. It works okay so far, but I could see that under normal circumstances, the tab could still get snagged and broken."
1,plastic,would not recomend this product it stretches and doesnt stay on the adhesive doesnt stick very well looks very cheap
4,2 games in one,"My 5 year old likes jigsaw puzzles and loves find-hidden-object games, so this is perfect for her. The hidden objects are super tiny, almost not visible with the naked eye, and just barely visible with the magnifying glass. She enjoyed it, and it made for a fun activity on a bad weather day. Look forward to trying the others in the series."
1,Do Not Purchase This : A TERRIBLE Price (for a great product),Please be aware that this vendor is charging more than TWO TIMES Aveda's retail price.
5,Mallory crab cap,"I needed to convert my Mallory unilite distributor to use the crab cap, because the standard cap sits too high to clear my air cleaner on my Big block Ford with 3 two barrel carbs. With the crab cap clearance is no longer a problem."
5,as close as chili parlor chili as you can get at home,"As a Cincinnati native, I KNOW my Cincinnati chili. If you can't get to a Gold Star (or Camp Washington Chili!), this seasoning is the next best thing. I've used it for years, with wonderful results. I deviate from the instructions on the packet, though, using two packets of seasoning per pound of ground beef (ground turkey works well, too, but don't brown either before simmering -- ruins the texture), a 6-oz. can of tomato paste, and a 28-oz. can of crushed tomatoes. Double or triple to make enough to feed a crowd. Serve with the sharpest Cheddar you can find. If you like Cincinnati chili, you WILL definitely like this."
2,Disappointing,I had another set and liked very much. But this one has very small connectors. It is not strong enough to stand still. We cannot move from one place to another because it collapses.
4,HP f70 pixel issue,"I had only one bad pixel and decided to live with it as it was a minor issue. However, after about 6 months I got a whole string of bad pixels down the left side of the screen and had to return the monitor for replacement. Otherwise, the display is very clear and I really like space saving the flat panel."
1,Opinionated therefore not factual,"This work represents all that is wrong with certain elements of the liberal establishment. Instead of acknowleding what's good in the Church, they insist on continuing their campaign of hatred against one of the remaining bastion of decency in this world...But again it is so fashionnable to be anti-catholic in certain groups nowadays..."
4,Great camera bulky battery charger,"I purchased this camera not too long ago. The quality of the pictures is great, the controls are conveniently located and the menu commands are very easy to use. The battery life is OK but not outstanding, a spare battery is a must. I used with a 32 MB memory stick, plenty for all your needs even working at the highest picture quality level (about 40 shots). Overall a very good product. The battery charger is very bulky,this is why I do not give it 5 stars.Jose Lopez"
2,Broken within 4 months,"This camera broke within 4 months, and the warantee only covers 3 months for labor. Therefore, I had to spend $[money] to get it fixed. I had a poor experience with their customer service staff."
2,Not Happy,"I bought this because of the warranty and looks, and I hoped it would last without problems. It worked perfectly for about 9 months, then the problems started. When I pump the soap, it oozes out at the top. I tried keeping the soap fairly watered down thinking the thick viscosity of many liquid soaps was causing the problem. It still leaked. Finally, it just wasn't pumping much out at all. So far, the nice warranty has provided two new pumps. The first one didn't work at all. Neither does the second one. I have no idea what is going on, but I'm really dissatisfied with this soap dispenser. The extra $$$ for this brand didn't pay off as far as I can see. I will attempt to get a complete replacement from either Rohl or the fixture store I bought from, and if the warranty is honored in that way, I will report back about it. Otherwise, at this point I think I wasted my money on this particular dispenser."
3,Asics Gell Rocket III REview,"Purchased the Asics Gell Rocket III for racquetball. Shoe designed more narrow than others. Have worn the shoe for 2 weeks. After wearing it for about an hour with court play, it presses down on the front fore of my foot making it almost impossible to walk. Other ball players have stated that it also feels tight around the fore foot and presses down."
2,5 1/2 months and sole is finished,"Bought this in June 2008 for junior player. Good fit and comfortable, but the uppers were chaffed and ragged from 3rd wear.Used only oncourt but the soles are completely worn smooth by mid November 2008, causing many falls on court.Not recommended for regular play ."
2,Cheap and misadvertised.,"The speaker is underpowered, does not come with the connection jack even though it says it will, no AC power unit. Another example of ""Made in China"" = ""Any lie to sell the product."" Caveat Emptor."
1,Hate this!,It falls apart and cuts my dough! I was looking for something that would crimp not cut. It is not good
5,Looked all over for this product!,"After searching many stores and shopping on line, I finally found the Ravioli cutter I had been looking for. The shipment was sent in 2 separate orders as one was a backorder. Even so, I received them promptly and in excellent shape. Thank you for helping to complete my Christmas List."
3,Not as good as i thought,This battery only last about half compare to the batterythat came with the nikon 995 camera.I used both of them under the same condition. It still good forspare batteries but dont expect it to last as long as theoriginal battery.
1,Bad batteries,One of these batteries is showing expansion and ready to burst. The other wont hold a charge and has been that way for over 6 months. Less than 20 charges ever put on them.
3,Extreme tribal trance (for ambient music),"Heavy on the tribal and trance sounds mixed with very cutting edge electronic music. A few tracks verge on nightclub electro dance music. Towards the end of cd #2 it gets very tribal on the vocals, not so much on the rhythms and sounds. Although each track is quite different, once the tune gets going, it gets repetitive as if to induce a trance. It's very good to listen to if you are working on a project or even to work out to."
5,Creativity and Credibility,"Of all general leadership approaches, this is the most useful one I've ever seen; it's a book I've recommended many times to people with high responsibility.Hitt presents his ideas, how a credible, solution-oriented manager, who estimates his/her employees, should behave. Using some examples, he shows what typically goes wrong in management (managers not talking to their employees in crisis, instead of using their full creative power, e.g.) and how one could do better.Yet it is not an anti-authoritarian approach, but rather an instruction for the manager. Its useful for both, industry managers, and army commanders."
2,Where was the editor?,"I found the writing to be awkward, fragmentary, and amateurish, begging the question as to whether this was a translation from some other language. While I don't expect treasure hunters to emulate Hemingway in their story telling, I do expect their editors to do better policing of the work. The writing is so unpalatable that I have not found the patience to read through the entire book yet. I also found that I was looking for more depth with respect to the historical context and the contemporary work on the projects. A better personal narrative may aid in the contemporary discussion.That being siad, I did find that there were some interesting factoids scattered throughout the book and plenty of excellent pictures. The material does have merit but needs substantial re-write for it to earn high marks from me."
5,An excellent adventure,"Treasures of the Spanish Main: Shipwrecked Galleons in the New World tells of gold, treasure, and fleets which promised riches to divers who would unearth them. It's a history of the ships who sailed the 'Golden Highway' laden with gold - and it uses both historical record and the diving explorations of modern treasure hunters to spice its story of pirates, wrecks, and history. An excellent adventure evolves.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,Homedics Lemon,"My HoMedics luxury footbath died an unnatural death after 3 months of extremely light use - it worked fine the first three times I used it, then there was a break over the holidays, and I returned to it only to find that the bubbler or massager was dead - the water stayed hot but no bubbles and no power jet. Although inexpensive when compared to some of the other high dollar foot spas, it turned out to be pretty expensive when you consider its working life - I would not buy this brand again."
4,Louder than I expected...,"I got htis for my husband as a Christmas present. It is louderthan I expected it to be, but not so loud that he can't hear the TV over the noise. He has used it a couple of times, and he really likes it. The handle on it is really nice when you are moving it from where you filled it to where you are sitting down. Overall, good value for the price as long as all you want is a basic model."
2,Great Disappointment,"I got this to soothe my over worked and cracked feet. I wanted to add a soothing healing salt to my bath and the foot well is way too shallow, so the salts made the water foam up and ended in a huge mess. I put really hot water in the foot bath and used the heat option...the water turned from hot to lukewarm to cold in a matter of five minutes. The massage is nice but the jet feature is a joke. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you are really tight on cash...but even then, I would save up for a nicer one."
1,Not so relaxing...,"I must have received a defective product, ""4 powerful jets"" were barely powerful enough to feel, the ""double the bubbles"" produced no bubbles, the heating system did not seem to work, and worst of all, the drain plug was not operational and the water leaked out while i was using it, leaving a mess behind. As for the attachments, the only one that was really effective was the brush."
1,Died on first use!,"Enjoyed the bubbly massage... for about 30 seconds on first use, then they just quit working. Also did not keep the water warm at all. Returning ASAP and getting another brand!"
2,User Error,"Yeah, it may be easier to just go to the spa. With trial and error, I was able to sort of soak my feet before going to a party. The first time I put to much bubbles, then the water was too hot, then to cold. I have carpet in my bedroom and livingroom and this was rather uncomfortable to use in the shower while sitting on a chair. The product itself working as stated, it keeps the water warm, the massage feels good, easy to dry and store. I do have one complaint, it was very hard to remove the attachements from the center strubbing mount."
5,Technique AND artistry,"Usually I go with Rubenstein for Chopin, but since that recording was made in the '40s, I opted to take a chance for the sake of better recording quality. Apparently, Sokolov is an eccentric, a la Gould, so I knew I'd either love it or hate it. First, his technique-- on the faster preludes: virtuosic and amazing. But more importantly, his artistry in interpreting-- the B minor prelude is a good example. It was unrushed with dynamic shadings that this piece deserves. Not all the Preludes are equally worthwhile, but they're all good, and some are great. I recommend this recording highly, especially if you want effective interpretations of the three or four more familiar ones."
3,Not for beginners,"I have been playing guitar for over 45 years, but due to a medical condition I have to learn a new way to play. I bought this video in hopes of learning how to play a new style but this is definitely NOT for beginners.It would be alright if you were already an accomplished lead player, but the average player should probably just look elsewhere."
4,It's interesting,"Mine did not come with a description card, but when I give this as a gift, I will relate the information. The cross does have a lot of variations in the grain- mine has super dark swirls on just the right side *not really the look I wanted*. But it is all wood and will make a great baptism gift."
3,"Nice finish, badly put together","A few weeks after I got this cross, it came apart. I had to reglue it together. Still nice looking, but disappointed that I had to fix it so soon after receiving it."
5,The most accurate sounding Blind lemon Jefferson cd,"This man is the foundation of country/texas blues; everyone has been directly or indirectly influenced by him.This collection is the most accurate representation of Blind lemon jefferson's music;which includes country blues,spirituals & folk songs.Being a texas country bluesman myself; in my opinion, Blind Lemon Jefferson & Charlie Patton are the best bluesmen that ever lived ."
2,Center speaker accuracy very poor,This speaker system definitely fills the room. But the quality and the sound reproduction accuracy of its center speaker is very poor. The center channel in 5.1 AVR typically carries the dialog and the main sound track of movies. The center speaker of this system does a poor job of reproducing the center soundtrack and music signals. I switched the center speaker with a Bose VCS-10 and noticed a major improvement. The latter speaker is not considered the best of the breed either. But it still does a better job than the center speaker of RM6000. A better choice is probably RM6700.
2,Not what I thought...,This case is useless. It came with a very small strawberry shortcake pendant (and no chain to actually wear it). I did purchase some figures for this and they do not fit it properly. They only fit in the compartments if they are lying down. The compartments fall out too easily also. My daughter rec'd this for Christmas and it has sat on a shelf and not been played with at all.
2,doll house pretty empty,"When I ordered this playset I thought it had ""dolls"" and would have items in it to actually use. It had one tiny strawberry shortcake doll and that was it. It was pretty much a carrying case for all the other stuff that we have not obtained yet. My daughter just looked at me like, ""what do I do with this?"" big dissapointment for her and me. Somewhat misleading in the product description.pretty colors. Easy to carry for children."
3,Jump rope,It helped a little but I was looking for more of a routine. This video just taught the basics of how to jump.
1,Not great for me,"I own what seems to be the previous version of this video, but I must say it did nothing for me. Apparently this new version closes in on the feet so you can learn how to do the steps better, which I imagine would be helpful. Version #1 has none of that, the music is boring and the tone of voice the trainer uses is mostly dull. No excitement, which to me is a MUST!!I'm afraid this is one DVD that will go back in the shelf for a long time."
1,poor quality,"this video has very poor audio , not worth the cost, presentation appears like low budget , not the $22 cost, dont waste your money"
5,"WOW, I can Eat whatever I want !!!",I can't believe after decades of diets and never keeping my weight off I can honestly say that this video has changed my life. After only one month I've lost 15lbs. and I'm still eating whatever I want. This is the best workout imaginable and the routines and music are awesome. But above all this is the most fun I've had losing weight ever! Thanks Annette Maria.
1,Come Again,"Another one of those ""yeah, sure"" records. Could well be Mad Professor, but I wonder if Lee Perry was even near. As a big Perry fanatic, I'm sadly disappointed, for sure."
4,"Lee ""Scratch"" Perry Meets the Mad Professor in Dub","a fresh & consistent list of tracks from the meeting of two dub masters--one of the best known jamaican dub masters of the 1970's, and one from the 1980's. the only downside to this collection of dubs is that it could all fit onto one disc--two discs is entirely unnecessary & a little overpriced. good music, though not as hysterically enthusiastic as some of perry's recordings. dub fans will not be disappointed. musician credits: ""sean and joe, blacksteel, and joe richard."" not much information on the liner notes."
2,not pleased,these will not work with my printer. contacted avery and said there was nothing they could do. but that is ok because I bought them for labels for my homemade candles and I can just write on them.
4,Well Written..,"Imagine your sister being brutally murdered by her boyfriend and everything changing so fast, you didn't even have the chance to blink. That's what happened for Leo. It's the fourth anniversary of her death and he can't get the images of her being stabbed out of his head. Especially with his mother in a rage and showing him the pictures over and over. So he flees into his car and drives until he sees Bree, in her short skirt, high heels, and ruby red lipstick. In a rage, Leo kidnaps Bree, persistent that she should have been the one to die, not his beautiful and perfect sister. . What happens the following night changes the way both Bree and Leo look at things. I loved the emotion in this book because it felt so real. One thing, I didn't understand was why Bree didn't report Leo when he kidnapped her. For all she knew, he could of done these type of things to everyone. Other than that, this book was great."
1,bizarre book,"this book was a quick, bizarre read that made me deeply uncomfortable, but not in the way the author was intending. leo's character is obviously traumatized by the brutal murder of his sister and the over-the-top dissolution of his family afterward, but we are treated to a healthy dose of misogyny and victim-blaming that has no real resolution or correction within the story, and ends up with the main character's victim getting a little crush on him. wittlinger also ends the book before she has to figure out how bree can explain her night of being kidnapped to her family, which is a huge copout."
3,Being Kidnapped by Leo,"This book is about a boy who had a sister that died from her boyfriend. He can't forget about his sister and how she died. Her boyfriend stabbed her fifty seven times, and Leo keeps seeing the pictures of his sister when she is dead. This book is also about a girl named Bree who is tired of her perfect boyfriend, her perfect mother, and her perfect life. So one night she goes out on a ride to get away from everything and gets kidnapped by a guy that says she should have died, and not his sister Michelle. It ends up being Leo getting `revenge', even though Bree has nothing to do with the murder of his sister.I liked the whole story, but not at the end because it leaves you hanging, and there are two narrators which are Leo, and Bree and sometimes it gets confusing.I would recommend this book to teenagers (mostly girls) who are into mystery books."
2,Hmm...Not Ellen Wittlinger's Best At All,"Ok, maybe I am a little biast because I read Hard Love the same day that I read this book, and I loved Hard Love. I did not think that this book was good at all. The fact that someone would ""identify"" and ""become real"" to their kidnapper is just beyond me completely. And the fact that Bree did not trun him in is just stupid. That girls need to wake up and smell the crime! I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a quick read, and has nothing to do. The thing that I did like about this book was that the emotions were right on the page. That's why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. I loved the emotion, but hated the story."
3,IMHO: Metra is better,"If you have a choice, I suggest you go with a Metra adapter. I got both this one and Metra as I was not sure which one would fit better and although this one looks like it should work ok, Metra is better made and it looks much more like an OEM plug."
4,"Good analysis, too much focus on US policy","This is a well written, up to date interesting book. However it is written from an amercian analysts view. The analysis is good, but in my opinion it has to many references to US policies. Everett presents three different perspectives of Bashar; as a reformer, as a status-quo president and as a lame-duck president and measures these views with his actual recent policy. It clearly demonstrates that Syrian policymaking is quite complex. Furthermore, it is as an authoritative account on Syrian contemporary politics. The concluding thoughts are however, in my opinion, perhaps a bit optimistic.Recommended reading for everyone interested in Levant- and authoritarian politics!"
3,Hard to get used to,"Used this a few times out in the woods. First tried to use it as a ground shelter, which is what I originally bought it for, but there is no way to stake down the corners, and I ended up having the mesh resting on my head most of the night. I did use it as a hammock twice, which was okay, though still awkward to position myself in. I used a friends Eno slap straps and caribiners to secure it to the trees, as it doesn't come with anything to rig it up, and though it held up (I'm 235-240 lbs), it still looks pretty flimsy, and if one of the cords breaks, it looks like the whole side would be useless. Not a fan of the multiple strings. Stitching seems okay. This will be good for occasional use during the summer, but I doubt it would hold up much for extended use, unless you weigh under 200."
5,AWESOME,If your a bigger guy then I would replace the cords with some 550 paracord i mean it can hold 550lbs. per strand...
5,"Probably the best fiction writer alive, in any medium.","O.k., so why do you need to read yet another review singing the praises of Season of Mists? You probably don't have to, but I need to tell you this book is nothing short of incredible. The dialouge, art and story are simply fantastic. Mr. Gamien weaves ancient mythology and psychological archetypes with remarkable dexterity. Warning:once you read Season of Mists, it's very likely you will never look at the world in the same old mundane way. Truly a master at the peak of his form"
5,"Review of Sandman, Vol. 4","This work represents a return to coherent narrative, which I really appreciate. Volume Three was great, but it was a collection of stories, of dreams, rather than what I was expecting. Volume Four presents Gaiman back at the loom, weaving a host of Gods and Endless into several stunning chapters. I really enjoyed this thoughtful, engrossing work."
5,Gaiman is brilliantly,Uhm...this guy is like really really good. Favorite book of the series. Thank you.
4,"Gods, Demons, and Angels.","It begins with a family get togethar of the Endless. Then we have Dream going to Hell to rescue a lost love. Dream recieves the key to Hell. Then we have deities and principalities and angels arriving vie for the key to Hell. Tehn an annoying intelude at a boarding school. Then Dream makes his decision to who the key should go. Great fiction, great art."
5,I always suspected Thor had no manners . . .,"As everyone knows who reads his stuff, Gaiman is as original as. In this installment, the Lord of Dreams (one of the Endless, all of whom begin with a ""D"") goes to Hell prepared to do battle with Lucifer in order to obtain the release of an ex-lover he condemned there some ten thousand years ago. But Lucifer surprises him by evicting everyone from the underworld, shutting the place down, locking it up tight, and handing the Dreamer the key. What happens in a Creation with no functioning Hell? For one thing, the dead come back (not ""to life"" -- just back). For another, a great many deities from an assortment of pantheons, not to mention the evicted demonic tormentors, want to get their hands on the vacant property for their own reasons. As I said: Extremely original. And very well worked out, too. Another strong hit from a true Big Leaguer."
5,Like a familiar melody,"I'm not an eloquent writer, but River Jordan is. Give this novel a chance - you won't regret it. There are so many levels to ponder, enjoy, and relish. One of the most important aspects for me is the Southern setting. Southerners are sometimes thought ignorant and without depth. The characters in River's novel shatter this stereotype.It's been a while since I read TMoMS, so I can't comment more specifically on the plot (I need to read it again!) But the feeling I still get when I think about this novel is a comfort, like a familiar melody that makes you smile when you start to whistle the tune. So read The Messenger of Magnolia Street, and then spread the word!"
5,My visit was too short!,"Shibbleth is not on any map; there are no GPS coordinates, but there is a guide book. In The Messenger of Magnolia Street, Author, River Jordan takes you there; she shows you where to look, then leaves to wander its streets. River Jordan writes with a southern style that reflects small town influence. Her deep faith is evident in tale of the classic battle of good and evil."
5,Lyrical,"The words in this book are so lyrical, so captivating, that I found myself reading it aloud to myself just for the pure pleasure of hearing the music of the story. It's beautifully, beautifully written. I was enraptured by the fresh storyline and charming small town of characters. I can't wait to read Jordan's second novel!"
5,Beautifully descriptive,"This is my first review and I just had to speak out after reading ""The Messenger Of Magnolia Street"". I love the way this writer describes things. Her writing style is fluid and compelling. Whether she's describing the scenery, a character or the drama and emotion of the moment, she pulls you into the story with sentences so descriptive you actually feel as though you exist in that place and time. Well done Ms. Jordan. I look forward to reading your other books. I am enchanted!"
4,Trippy little book,"I was sent to River Jordan by a Joshlyn Jackson website. She writes Southern-Woman/Family novels. Jordan's book is a Southern-Family novel with a Stephen King twist.Like most of this genre the Women are the caretakers of wisdom and culture. Unlike most, men have some sense of mystery as well.This book has none of the obvious as the Straub books and some of the King books. You are never sure what is real and what is not. This is a good thing.You are only sure of one thing and that is the interconnectedness of lovers, family and community. That is a pretty important thing and one which Jordan communicates regardless of all else that goes on.I know I am going to look for more of her books."
4,Conducting Better Job Interviews,"In a word, I would say RESOURCFUL! I found this book to be very helpful. As a new interviewer, the material was easy to read and it has proven to be very beneficial."
2,Not for the stay at home mom,"I was very dissapointed with this book. First of all, this is a book completely biased toward working mothers. Ms Lerner refers to a stay at home in her book as a martyr. She uses this book as a platform for her feminist agenda as SHE sees feminism. The whole book feels like she's trying to work out her guilt over how she mothered. She feels the need to say over and over that we're not responsible for how our children turn out. What on earth does that have to do with the present state of mothering? That is flawed logic. Of course we have a huge stake in how our children turn out. Check it out from the library before you buy it. You'll see what I mean!"
1,Very disapointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. Being a new mother I thought I would be able to relate, enjoy and learn from Harriet Lerner, however all I learned is that I would be better off reading other books. This entire book is nothing but reference to other authors, Drs, psychologists and more. I got a strong sense that Ms Lerner does not have an original thought of her own. Some of the anecdotes she uses about her family are humorous and entertaining but reading this book was more like eavesdropping on the mothers table in my local Starbucks. ...returns based on whether you liked a book or not, this one would be going back."
5,Entertaining and practical advice!,"As a new mother I have read everything I can get my hands on! This book though is for ME, not advice on how to quiet a crying baby or what to feed a picky 12 month old. It is about the feelings, thoughts and worries that a mother obsesses over each day. I cried, laughed and learned through the entire book and then receommended it to two friends. If you are looking for a book to read that talks about how becoming a mom has truly made you a completely different person this is it!"
3,cute concept,Tutter the mouse is worried that Santa might miss him since he is so small. The others in the house join in on the anxiety and decided they need to entice Santa with snacks so he comes to the Big Blue House. Cute story except I wasn't crazy about the end when tutter finds (what he thinks) santa at the christmas tree and it's bear dressed as santa. I thought this might confuse my 2 year old who loves these bear stories.
4,Cute Bear book,"If your children are a fan of the wonderful Bear in the Big Blue House program, they will love this holiday book. It is a shame this show is no longer on the air -- wholesome, entertaining, gentle -- we are thankful we can still find the videos and books through Amazon."
4,I liked it,"It had an intriquing premise, believable characters, and a great mystery about why Manhattan was ripped out of the earth and transported into outer space. My only problem with the book is that the technical information was a little excessive, but in most parts it made the story more credible."
5,great book,I still have my hard copy of this book. I have read it at least 5 times and have marked my favorite parts. now I have it on ebook.
3,It was not for me.,I use relaxing music while I perform the facial treatment to my clients.This was not the music that my clents fall down a sleep. I simply usedonly twice.
2,"""Relaxing it's not!""","If this album is relaxing then I suggest the creater of the title, ""The most relaxing New Age music in the universe"" either never left the farm or is so hyper a drum and bugle corp would be relaxing.I am very dissapointed.William Jowell (age 70)"
4,Nice CDs,"I normally do not review CD's but this one begs to be reviewed. This 2 CD set does not lie; it is some of the most relaxing music in the universe. I will not do a separate review of the other 2 CD set, More of the Most Relaxing New Age Music in the Universe, as it is equally good and relaxing. They seem to be all by Japanese artists, so you get a oriental feel in all the songs. I like it."
4,Very Nice,"Just about perfect for relaxation & massage! 4 stars only because a few of the songs have harder sounding notes, which i personally dont find very relaxing, but over all very satisfied!"
3,not recommend,"Most of the music are very relexing, 2-3 of them are so annoying I have to skip them.It does have some very nice songs, but the sound quality is very inconsistent, some is fine, but then the next one is like listening to old tape.I wouldn't buy another CD from ""The Most --- New Age Music in the Universe"" again."
4,a romantic adventure with a soul,"If you like romance, adventure, and a story that has a soul this one is for you. The maincharacters Kayla and Cal are deeply attracted to each other at first site but upon learning that Kayla is his presumed dead brother's fiance she becomes ""forbidden."" Throughout the rest of the novel the characters struggle to discover whether Cal's brother is really dead or not, and if family loyalty is worth the sacrifice of true love. I really enjoyed this book and I felt empathy for the dilemma Carl had to come to terms with. Where is the line drawn between the happiness of a family member and the self? I also like how Liam, the brother, is portrayed as someone worthy of love too, it makes his brother's devotion all the more believable. Read the book and find out!"
2,WHY dienable text to spefch?,"If you are going to charge this much for a copy of a book you don't need to print and ship..why,oh why dis enable text-to-speech??"
1,Forbidden,"I love Suzanne Brockmann's series but this book is boring, no life to either the female or male lead role. The plot might have had a chance if the lead roles could have had a discussion without all the "" heavy breathing and gazing"" at each other. I couldn't finish the book and wouldn't recommend for anyone.Forbidden (Bartlett Family)"
1,Horrible,"I have yet to see one of these Vanguard movies that aren't terrible, and this one is no exception. I guess they must be very cheaply made or something because the acting in each one I've seen has been atrocious, and the scripts are so boring that you don't even care to watch the whole thing. I suffered all the way through this one just so I could see if anything happens, and NOTHING happens. Zero stars."
4,Cool Sneaks!,"Great athletic shoes. Very Good support. Cool color combo & Great price, too! Plus Fast Shipping! *****"
2,Tends to distort image,"When I started loading photos onto this frame, I noticed that everyone looked like they had put on a few pounds. The frame was defaulted to 16:9 mode, and most of my photos were 4:3, so I changed the frame to 4:3. Of course, all of my photos (even the the 16:9 wide ones) showed up with vertical bars on both sides of the screen, and also with the people now looking too thin.I finally figured out that I could get a perfect image if I set the frame to 16:9 mode but then squeezed all of my images to 75% horizontally and then resized them to 480 pixels tall. So, my normal 4:3 photos have to be 480x480, my portrait 3:4 photos have to be 270x480, etc. And after all of this squeezing and resizing, the photos look perfect when displayed in the frame. But that's way too much work."
1,"No directions, No intermal memory","The directions are practically nonexistent. I have not been able to figure out how to store photos on this device. I believe you have to go out and buy a memory card and insert it in the slot on the bottom or else you have to keep your camera connected, by a USB cable, if you want to view pictures. The frame would not accept my cameras ScanDisk Smart Media card either. Photos are also distorted in 16:9 ratio and too small in the 4:3 ratio, with side bars taking up most of the frame.The frame is capable of acting as an alarm clock. However it is not convenient to use unless you want your alarm going off every morning. Too many steps to turn off the alarm function, not convenient at all. I would bring this back had I not received it as a gift."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","This frame is tiny, the resolution is terrible, and it takes about 4 or 5 tries to get it to see the memory card. I got this with credit card reward points - had I paid for it, I would send it right back.Skip it - spend a few more dollars and get something you will be happy with."
5,My Name best work is Rocks For The Jocks in '96...,"Definitely the best work by this band is ""Rocks For The Jocks In '96"",their third and last proof.But it isn't easy to find it,especially here in Europe.I received a copy of it directly from the bass player for the band.The publisher is Instant Records from Tacoma,Seattle...Try to get the cd in every way you can.This cd rocks!!!!!!!!!!!I don't know why here on Amazon there isn't a place for it."
2,Well the title is correct...,"The book is organized literally A-Z.... which makes it a bit disjointed as related topics are not near each other and no topic is really covered adequately. I was looking for something that would say ""Do this, this and this to have a Feng Shui friendly house"" (such as colors, placement/flow of furniture, natural lighting). Unfortunately it just gives you maybe a half page each on probably about 200 topics and never felt like enough to really do much of anything well and a lot of items that may be spiritual/feng shui oriented, but not what you would think would be in this book (like laughter, springtime and journal). It's one of those I scanned and not sure where it's gone off to at this point and will be looking for something else as I move into a new apartment soon..."
5,"Easy to use, excellent step by step, useful instructions","You can flip this to go to the section you want, or start at the beginning. either way, it's easy to understand, written in a gentle, loving way. After you do this, you feel so much cleaner, energetic, and ready to face the world! I love Denise Linn's humor and messages."
5,Very helpful for anyone!,"This is an excellent, alphabetical reference tool for anyone interested in energizing your space."
2,lovely but not my style,I gave it to my neighbor who was absolutely overjoyed. She loves this type of book.
4,Love Hate relationship,"I have been a Capsule fan for quite a while now, I must tell everyone, if you have an opportunity to see this band live, they are absolutely amazing. I don't feel that the mixing on this recording did them justice."
4,Film maker shows promise,"Just watched this movie today. It is a low budget film, but much like ""Detour"", the director shows a lot of talent and skill despite the low budget. The acting is uneven, some are good, others are bad, but the idea is interesting and the plot twists will have you guessing. The monster also looks especially good despite the low budget. The film has a weak opening, very forced, yet the more you watch the film, like Detour and the Shunned House, the more the movie grows on you. The film isn't perfect, but with a bigger budget, the director could probably make a very creepy film. The four star rating means, I'm going to buy it. It's a toss up if it should be three stars, but the lead actress helps tip the scales. She is very good."
5,More great music from Hank,"Hank starts this album rocking hard on the first three tracks, most notably If the south woulda won, one of two major country hits, which ponders what might have happened if the civil war had produced a different result. The pace slows a little for You're gonna be a sorry man, in which Hank protests to another man about taking his woman. Next comes Love M D, a bluesy cover of a Tony Joe White ballad, which provides a complete contrast with the four preceding songs.Early in the morning and late at night, a major country hit, is a mid-tempo love song. This is followed by a wonderful ballad, I'm just a man. Two more fine ballads follow, including Social call (about a telephone call). The album closes in grand style with the bluesy Tuesday's gone, a cover of a classic Lynyrd Skynyrd song - this version of the song was later re-issued on Skynyrd frynds.This is yet another fine album that Hank's fans will enjoy."
5,The Abduction,This was my first James Grippando book. I picked it up and read the first couple of pages and I was captured. This book will absolutely keep you on the edge of your seat. He is one of the best authors to come along in a long time. This book is very exciting and suspenseful. I love James Grippando!
5,A thrilling story about priorities and politics,A gripping tale about the abduction of a aspiring political candidate's child and the priorities in her life. This book will capture you and not release you until the last word...and even then the answers are not entirely unfolded.
3,"Okay story, but not the best.","I listened to this book on tape and although the story was fairly entertaining, Mr. Grippando used the word ""grimaced,"" so many times I was truly distracted. However, the reader pronounced the word, grim aced with a long ""a,"" rather than grim uhsed. The word was used probably 40 times in the book and became such a distraction that I cringed every time I heard it. As well the major theme of the book was never answered in the end. Frustrating!"
4,Definitely not Grippando's best. But not bad either,"I don't believe Grippando is capable of producing novels which are a total waste. However, I've read all of his work and consider this one to be the weakest link. It seemed overly saturated with politics and had a very brief ending considering the overall length of the novel. There were some intense moments that make this novel worth reading."
3,"Grippando is no J. Patterson, or D. Balducci, but tries...","Another book that reads like a movie. The writing held my interest only sporadically. The main character of Allison, first woman to run for President, was kind of dull. So was Howe, the first African American Republican running against her. The author tried to present him as a little evil, but didn't get into it (for fear of being politically incorrect, probably). Certain characters were great, like the kidnappers and some of the Howe's aides. I WILL say that the plot had some great twists near the end, but it had a very hasty ending. But many of these thriller books do (it's like the author has to hurry up and finish the book before going to sleep!) Readers should just for the paperback--& since this will probably be a movie, so wait for mass market tie-in"
2,"Do I listen to it, or eat it?","From the people who brought you Kava Kava and Ginseng, comes Ginkgo Biloba. This disc is supposed to make you more focused and clear. I noticed no such benefit. The music is very nice though. This series does make me wonder if they will be releasing other series, how about a vitamin series? Or a Garlic disc they could call ""The Stinking Rose, music to make you less prone to heart attacks."" I can't wait for the prescription drug series. And I think the entire city of San Francisco is waiting with baited breath for the Marijuana disc. No not the Pink Floyd disc, and no, not the Jefferson Airplane disc. As an herbal supplement, the disc bombs. It is too big to swallow, and the music puts you to sleep. As a New Age album, this is a solid if somewhat cliche offering."
1,not recommended.,"This book is a just another run-of-the-mill book to gather some quick $ and 5 mins fame. Besides lacking genuine insight on the subject, Robert Harvey hasn't done a better research in getting some of the facts mentioned in the book straight. For example, after the ending of Korean war for over 50 years, anyone who is adequately read on that piece of history knows that the commander of the Chinese force is actually Marshal Peng DeHuai, not Marshal Lin Piao, as it was presented in Harvey's book.For a better narrative on the relationship and interation between Gen. McArthur and Hirohito and the making of modern Japan, read the books: 1) Hirohito, and the making of modern Japan. written by Harvard scholar Herbert P. BIX. and 2) Emperor Hirohito and Showa Japan by Stephen S. Large. At least they have notes attached to the book for scholarly research and presentation."
3,The Libertarian Shoe is on the Other Foot,"In Forge, Smith returns to politics that seem dear to his heart. In a role reversal from Tom Pain Maru and the other works of the probability broach, in Forge we find that the humans are the unenlightened, bureaucracy laden ""primitives"", and the aliens are the wise, libertarian, anrachistic souls. The term alien fits only loosely, since the one hundred or more species represented are all from alternate Earths!The problem with this piece is that it is about three times as long as it should be. Smith introduces some twists and turns, but they are almost pointless as he endlessly lectures on politics and ethics.Even if you agree with the philosophies espoused here, the incessant repetition grows old."
5,From the frying pan into the fire...,"This is a three-in-one book, publishing Contact And Commune (renamed First Time The Charm), and Converse And Conflict (named Second To One), with the third and, maybe, final book in the series - Third Among Equals.The asteroid, 5023 Eris, has turned out to be a ship - a very, very old space ship full of danger but little in the way of answers for the Elders. Then there is ANOTHER murder. Also it turns out that the ship isn't uncrewed. And, what do you know, the Banker, one of the most powerful men on Earth, may still be alive.Eichra Oren and his friend Sam have their hands (and paws) full. Enemies are coming from every direction - from within their ranks, from within the asteroid and maybe from beyond the stars! Toss in the Galactic Confederacy and you have WHOLE other Universe thrown into the mix.It makes you want to toss in your sword, scream Uncle and get drunk. Great ending, maybe, to the series.I keep saying maybe because you never know with Mr. Smith."
2,A Slow Read,"This novel, divided into three books in one volume, took me the better part of a year to read. The problem for me was the extensive detail, especially to socio-political theory. Most of the time I felt as though I was merely observing the author talking to himself, setting up one straw man after another and then knocking each one down.If atheism bothers you and anarcho-capitalism isn't your cup of tea, then this book won't do much for you. The science fiction aspect didn't really become interesting until the third section of the book, after already enduring seemingly endless political tirades. It was, in a word, tedious.Though I'm glad that I can say I've now read a book by this author, I do not intend to follow up with any of his other work."
3,Not his best work.,"An interesting diversion in the endless universes of the Probability Broach, El Neil is humorous, and certainly does wear his idiology on his sleeve. I have read the first two books of this triad, and I must admit that while the ideas are interesting, the story is rather...dull.Sorry, Mr. Smith, I gotta say what I think. I believe that the third book was originally dropped not because it was ""too radical"", but because the books weren't selling. I intend to purchase this book, first because I do wish to know how it all turns out, but also for completeness. My original copy of The War Dove and The Galatin Divergence are lonely.Every OTHER L. Neil Smith book that I've read I have enjoyed very much. Hopefully, the third triad of Forge will redeem the first two."
2,Somewhat weak; definitely misleading,"As an LNS fan, I was looking forward to this. I was very disappointed to find out that this was two other books (Contact/Commune/Converse/Conflict) plus a third to fill out the trilogy. I couldn't find anything (I looked afterwards) mentioning that 2/3 of this was reprinted material. No copyright, no notice, nothing. (There were some trivial edits to the first two books, but nothing substantial)So, I consider the third book to be the only (""non-policy"") thing reviewable. It's a bit weak. Yes, it's got the (LNS's) standard individualism rants and humor, but it just smells like someone went back the well one too many times. Makes me want to go reread Prob. Broach again to get the taste out of my mouth."
5,Wonderful feel,I love this hair spray! It smells great. It holds without making your hair look like it's peterfied. Very good value.
4,Despite lack of colour worked great!,"I actually bought the 10 pack at Target to try when we got a new HP Tower that had a Lightscribe drive. I was very happy with it. It took me a little while to figure it out but you look at the pictures and read the instructions and figure it out. Just because something is new does not mean it will eat you.While it is a bit sad that you can not do colour in the labeling they turned out very well. I used a mid-sized background which would cover font to see how good the contrast was and was happy with it. Completely legibile, both the English words and the Chinese characters. I just ran the program as it came on the tower and was very happy. I was happy, the person it was for was happy, and the person who was using it was happy and very impressed with it (though that may be because they are still living in the era of Sharpies and printed labels - thermal printing impresses them)."
1,Unusable,"I bought these for use with my HP DVD740e Lightscribe DVD burner. The device would not write to them. Not one of them! I have never had this problem when using similar blanks with HP and Verbatim labels. The Memorex blanks I had were made by CMC Magnetics. What a waste.FYI - Windows users can get a small -- but distinct -- increase in label darkness with the use of a free utility found on LightScribe's site. It increases the contrast. ""Best"" quality labels do take longer to create.I guess Amazon does not allow web addresses. If you want the utility, search for ""Lightscribe Exstended Label Contrast Utility"" without the quotes. Or you can take a big guess at the name of a commercial site devoted to LightScribe."
1,Lightscribe side doesn't work,"I am able to burn data to the data-side of the discs, but my HP Lightscribe DVD burner will not recognize these Memorex discs as Lightscribe discs, so a Lightscribe labels cannot be burned."
1,"""No Media Detected"", again and again...","That's the message I got from the LSS Diagnostic Utility after going through half a stack of these. After much frustration I stopped trying. Not a single one could be used, what a waste of money considering how much more expensive they are. The data side is OK but the printable side is useless. Might as well use a marker and draw your own design on the label. Might work for others but read the reviews around and not just here in Amazon. Why take a chance with your money? Try another brand, I know I will never buy these again."
1,Just didn't work,"My computer couldn't register them as valid media. Very frustrating. Diagnostics on my drive worked fine, and other media worked fine. Honestly, I think that Memorex just cut too many corners."
3,Lightscribe Labels,Lightscribe labels are OK. I was happy to not mess with printed stick-on labels. I was disappointed because thelack of color. I thought the lightscribe label was not well defined with my HP DVD840. I'll probably go back to stick-on labels.
2,To much focus on race,"The author has gone to great lengths to produce a coherent, easy to read, easy to learn book based on khemetic spirituality. What ruins the whole experience for me is the constant focus on racism and black people being the true root of all things egyptian. The author is obviously involved in the revival of the black communities, somthing that is admirable and even long due. However, for readers who are not american, and have little understanding of whatever racist elements may persist over there to this day - it becomes annoying to read.Also, i might add - most of the mummies that have been found are neither black or white, but have more in common with indians as far as i know. So it is (in my view) pointless to bring such a debate into a book of spirituality. The spirit has no color.But the information and viewpoints of the author are very interesting. I lost interest however, since page after page is jogged down with black panthers like propaganda."
1,Unscientific,"This book is completely unscientific. Its subject matter is fictitious, yet it claims to be true. It seems to be attempting to rewrite Egyptian history also."
3,a so-so book,This has good poems. But it is not the best book I have ever read. Take it or leave it.
3,avrege,This book was ok. It had pretty poems but it was nothing special. It was pretty avrege. Sorry Jewel!
1,"1 star for ?, 5 stars comic relief!","Now I know that there is a difference a BIG difference between a songwriter, poet and comedian. I know this book is not intended to be funny, but to me the poetry ""It is poetry:thoughts"" was just funny to me. I cannot give this book a fair rating because it is not a fair book. When will songwriter, actors, atheletes,models whatever! realize that just because they are good at one thing, doesn't mean that they are good at the other! God help the corporate/mainstream talent industry!"
3,WARNING: For the True Jewel fan ONLY!!,"While most of Jewel's song might be entertaining and enlightening, her book of poems is neither. Most of the poems are of little interest except those interested in knowing something about Jewel and her life, as most of her ""poems"" are autobiographical. Most of her poems do not really qualify as poems, even in free verse. If one takes her poems and would put them into paragraph form, one would be changed to decide if it was originally a poem or journal writing. Although it is easy to be critical of someone else's poetry, Jewel's poetry, as others have said, is an honest effort. Perhaps it is just the way that Jewel writes which makes many people dislike her poems, but for those truly interested in knowing a little bit of how she was raised or her thoughts on different topics, it is a book well worth reading, mind you, not buying. Unless of course, you are like me and doing a research paper on Jewel and her poetry."
5,GREAT,JEWEL IS THE BEST. HER POETRY AND MUSIC HAVE HELPED ME GET THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES IN MY LIFE. SHE IS GREAT. I HOPE SHE NEVER STOPS WRITING OR SINGING SHE HAS COME ALONG WAY AND BECAUSE OF HER I FIND THE AMBITION TO FIND MY DREAMS.
1,"Juvenile, Trite and Gimmicky","It is a sad indictment of the state of literature when a collection of what is thinly disguised as poems by an ineffectual pop chanteuse can become the highest selling in American history (two million and counting, they say.) And for the illiterates out there, it's now available as a recording, with- surprise!- little bits of the neo-folk goddess herself 'clumsily strumming her guitar.' I wonder what Emily Dickinson would think?"
2,Oh my goodness,"Stick to music, Jewel. This is not even second-rate poetry. God help those of us who want to see good poetry reach the masses. . ."
5,execellent writings from the heart,"I have found that many of these reviews are very critical of the nature of this book. People are critizing this book because most of the poems don't rhyme, or sometimes don't even make a complete sentence. But hating this book just because it doesn't fit YOUR critria of peotry really is not a good argument. I liked the book because it expresses a lot of feelings and emotions that come from the heart, and that come from the heart of someone who has loved, hated, and been hurt. Listening to the words, and almost living the words help make you understand what point she is getting across. This poetry sends empathy into the hearts of anyone who has truly loved, hated, or been hurt. Some of her poems I did find to be a little bland, sad, or disturbing, but overall, I did enjoy reading this book."
5,A Breath of Fresh Air,"This book is truly touching. I admire the fact that someone can make such personal thoughts and feelings so public. I am upset that some people can talk so badly of another's true expressions. Art is always going to be different and controversial. It is silly to say that any art is ""bad"". Who classifies ""bad""? There will always be a different perspective. Jewel's words are wonderful and honest. They are color to this gray world. A breath of fresh air in a world that cherishes Walt Whitman. Jewel's writing is reminiscent of the writings of Octavio Paz, Charles Bukowski and Pablo Neruda. She is the perfect feminine counterpart to modern poetry."
1,This was repulsive,"I have never been so insulted on both an intellectual and emotional level. What can I say, she has NO talent. I am fifteen years old and have written more profound and life-altering poems on my math homework, and I'm not getting paid for my thoughts on life. People are looking to her for an insight into the unknown we call life, and she throws back dribble. I am very offended as to the matter of this book. She has disappointed me to no end."
1,A Night without Armor= A Poet without Talent,"This is the worst poetry ever written. If I ever wrote anything this bad, I'd burn it and bury the ashes in the backyard. I don't blame Jewel, she's obviously an idiot and can't be held accountable for a disaster of this magnitude. I blame the people who published this trite, hackneyed piece of garbage. And where does she get off becoming the spokesperson for National Poetry Month ? Visibilty doesn't equal respectabilty. I guess popularity is the hallmark of mediocrity.-"
1,A night without Armor hotdogs....,"What kind of kid eats Armor hotdogs? Short ones, tall ones, fat ones, small ones... Hotdogs, Armor hotdogs: They're the dogs kids love to bite!There I made a poem; now publish me, too!"
2,In all Objectivity,"In all, Jewel's book is not bad. The quality of the work ranks at fair to good undergraduate poetry. There are some clever lines and a small scattering of images worth remembering. The work does, however, lack the sculpted clarity and remarkable insight that makes a book of poetry truly great, or truly memorable. But, in light of that, Jewel's book is not completely without merit. I would recommend this book to those with a passion for melodrama, or those who simply like to see some poetry and are not terribly demanding about craft. But if you are interested in poetry that is going to burn the roof of your mouth, your time might be better spent elsewhere."
2,One star for effort,"I feel generous. This is a one star book. I know several performance poets who could do one reading of one poem and put this book to shame. In comparison to other published Gen-X poets, Jewel has nothing unique to offer, hence this poor book is predictable and, as such, expendable.For anyone interested in better present-day poetry, check out Michelle Tea and Beth Lisick. Both have books that can be ordered through Amazon.com. Also look into Ellyn Maybe's ""The Cowardice of Amnesia"" and C.E. Amestoy's ""Making-Millennium."""
1,A night without grammar,"Probably my favorite backhanded compliment of all time is in the Amazon.com review above: ""Jewel's book of poetry is solid by celeb-poet standards."" When that's the highest praise available, a negative review of this silly book seems redundant."
1,The decline of Western Civilization continues apace,"No. Please God, no. Will anyone stop the banal march of celebrities from deafening us all? No. No one has the guts. This is really, really bad. At best, it's full of sleazy impressionism. But mostly, it has all the depth of a birdbath. And yes, she actually writes verse about her breasts."
1,not worth the money--if you are serious about poetry,"""songs"" broken into haphazard lines do not constitute ""poetry""--it is apparant the publisher and Jewel are capitalizing on her success as a song writer/singer. What is missing in this book of ""poems"" is the altogether attention to craft and art. There is little, if any, attention paid to line breaks, to the integrity of the line as a unit, and to the common conventions which make up the foundations of a lyric or narrative poem."
2,Tin ear,"I don't really have anything against Jewel, she can write poetry if she wants to, just like anybody else. But I know good poetry when I hear it, and this isn't it. Like so much modern poetry, it seems like some prose that has been arbitrarily broken up into lines and called a poem. The lack of structure might be alleviated by a winning way with words, but Jewel can't seem to make the words sing on their own, without music to accompany them."
2,I would not call this poetry.,"Jewel may be a talented song writer and she may have a lot of interesting things to say, but I would not call it poetry. I think a more acurate title would be: The Journal of Jewel Kilcher, or Thoughts of Jewel Kilcher. If you want real poetry read some poetry by people who have really perfected their craft, like Walt Whitman, or Emily Dickinson."
1,This is a must-not read!!!,"There are many more poets--men and female--who deserve a chance to display their poetry, and yet Jewel seems to put this book out--which is horrible--just because of who she is. Now, I don't read much poetry, and I'm not going to claim I'm an expert, but her poems didn't do anything for me. I could write better than that, and I don't write. I think the people who dedicate a lot of time into writing good poetry should be recognized."
2,Search on!!!!!!,"Good for jewel to print her poems. She is a sex kitten. And she is opening doors for other poets to be read. So I say if you want the real deal go read EE Cummings ""100 Poems"" Leonard Cohen ""Stranger Music"" Aurthur Rimbaud ""A season in Hell"" Jack Gilbert ""The Great Fires"" Jeff Markey ""Caged""Open your eyes to these poets and you will not be let down."
1,"Sad, very sad.","I am not writing this review to demean Jewel. I don't believe this work is entirely without talent, but it does not deserve to be the bestseller that it was. My main issue with this book is that some true poet with geniune talent probably got bumped so this could ride a popularity wave to bestselling status. That is what makes me a little upset. I have known a couple of amazing poets that do everything to get their work even looked at by a publishing company, LOOKED at, mind you, being published is something else altogether. I have to be on the side of the many wonderful struggling poets and feel ashamed of another celebrity using their status as a springboard into somewhere they have no business being."
2,"Worth Reading, But Not That Great","This book contained a small handful of truly superb poems. Unfortunately, a lot of it was rather poor, and in many cases not even poetry. I find that I am a much bigger fan of her music--especially the first album--than her poetry. But because of the handful that found to be excellent, and because it really shows you more of the inner workings of Jewel, it is a book work reading. If you are not a fan of Jewel's music, however, I DEFINATELY would not recommend this book."
3,nice effort,"jewel should stick to singing. Her poetry isn't as bad as I was expecting, but it wasn't that great. She seemed to be stuck on theme, love, or rather a loss of love. Which is fine for some poems, but when all but two or three of your poems turn out to be sappy, broken-hearted whining, it's time to find something else. She had a lot of good ideas and lines but the total package was disappointing. The prologue was nice. And the paintings featured throughout the collection looked more or less like the same one, over and over."
2,"A fine recounting of Jewel's life, but not very poetic","It's certainly interesting to read about Jewel's life in Alaska, and her other experiences, but she should have done it in memoir form, because that's what almost all of her poems read like. Excepting the occasional obtuse simile or inscrutable metaphor thrown in, her poems are plainly written prose, with line breaks. A poem, being a short work should have, if not rhyme or meter, then powerful images, flowing lines, a play on words. Something to catch the reader's eye. Jewel gives us a few lines of broken prose, then moves on. It's slightly informative, but little else."
1,"Jewel, your poetry stinks!",This is poetry? Ummmm...I think not. Nice try though Jewel. With a couple more classes in how to write you might come close next time. Then again...you might not.
1,Not Poetry,Warning: This book contains no poetry. It is more or less a collection of what Jewel thought at given moments in her life. There is no poetic structure. What we have here is a journal by a very shallow woman that is being passed off as poetry.
1,If you think this book is poetry it's a sad day.,"I'm serious. Any serious poet or reader of poetry knows this. After reading quality poetry for years I was unfortunate enough to encouter this book. This book is filled with short cliches, familiar lines, indecent subjects, and a shallow approach to all of them. This surely is not what poetry is about. Jewel should do us all a favor and keep her horrible attempts at real poetry away from the shelves. And you as a reader, don't fall into the superstar trap of buying a bad product because you like the songwriter. This book provides no depth into anything, and furthermore it provides no poetry!"
1,Ouch!,"I can't believe people actually buy this book. It must be her deranged, hormone-raging teenage fans."
2,"AIN'T SO BAD, AIN'T THE WORLD","I'm glad if you like this book. I thought some of the poems were good, and that they even provided links to other writers whom I really admire, like Bukowski. If you don't like the book, that's OK, too. There's enough poetry on Amazon.com for everyone to buy."
1,This book is horrible,"I like breasts as much as the next guy, but even hundreds of breast references cannot save this horrible collection of ""poetry."" I am sure many real poets are offended by Jewel's childish ramblings."
1,Foolish games or poems in this case,"I think that this generation has sunk to an all new low- they need Jewel's ""inspiration"" to read real poetry. I'm sorry to let you all in on something, but she does not wirte poetry. I'm also sorry for all of you who are first being exposed to poetry in this manner. You will find that real poetry is much deeper, clearer, profound, and structured that Jewel's fragments. For the reviewer who asked for poets, try some of the standards. If you don't like Shakespeare who is wonderful, try some contemporary stuff like Robert Pinksy."
3,Outsteps Jewel's Literary Limits,"Although Jewel's poetry collection: "" A Night Without Armor,"" seems to offer the reader an opportunity to gaze at select snapshots of Jewel's innermost thoughts, she appears to attempt profoundness using abstract, and often non-poetic images. Hers is a blunt story. Rather than allowing the reader to create images of his/her own, Jewel forces us to accept and struggle to understand the interrelationships of her imagery. This is not to say the the book did not contain any worthwhile script. Jewel has some really great pieces also which I'm sure represent the creative lyracist she has demonstrated to be within the music she writes. Maybe the book needs to undergo a few more readings; you know, like when you first dislike a song but the more your hear it, it kind of grows on you."
1,High school poetry glorified.,"Remember those girls in high school, the ones with the unicorn binders who wrote terrible poetry for the school paper, usually with lots of ""and what u did to ME"" types of lines? The kind who read 3 ee cummings poems and think ""I can do that!"" and go on and write about...nothing important at all?? Well, if that's your style, then THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU."
2,Not as good as Yeats,"Jewel is like a ghost in a dream. Her works speak to the ephemeral hart of the soul. Some crued spirits seem willing to suggest that her works are not tip top literature but, so what! All that matters of poetry is that it touches the heart and speaks to the soul, and that is what Jewel does in spades. Still, she is not as good as Yeats."
5,The defense of poetry,"Alright, I admit it, I'm a Jewel fan, but I'm not directly stepping up to her defense here...I haven't even read the book. But as I was reading the reviews posted I couldn't help noticing the many comments that insisted the book was bad becuase of it's autobiographical nature. That's what poetry is, an artful statement of one's experiences. I really don't know what the rest of you people have been reading, but as far as the more famous poets are concerned, most, if not all of their material is based on their lives and observations. Just because most of Jewel's poems aren't laid out in neat little rhymed verses for you does not mean that they are worth less artistic value than those of a poet that follows rigid rhyme scheme and poetic form. Anyways, there are only so many combinations of rhym that can be written, freeverse allows much more freedom and variation. Sorry to bother you, I just felt this needed to be said, even if you don't agree..."
1,A Repost,"This is what happens when you raise a generation on the idea that one can write poetry totally devoid of any meter, rhythym, attention to word choice, and, for that matter, talent. But to publish it? Uniqueness, contrary to what one of the other readers claimed, does not always make you good. I may be a complete and total failure, horrible at what I do, and still be unique. Jewel is thoughtless, amoral (who else would publish such a thing?), heartless, merciless, and completely talentless, at least when it comes to poetry. Yet so many people have read and bought her book, even though it reminds me of shredding scores of papers in a shredder, scattering them, then rearranging them in an order that hardly makes sense, nor wants to. So I guess she is unique, and yet none of us want to be like her.To the person who wanted to meet Jewel: Buy a ticket. You'll find her concerts are very rarely if ever sold out."
1,I only read one of the poems... and that was enough.,"The only way these poems can be done justice is if they are read my ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin on late night television. She looks good, tho. I looked in the back to see where these poems were published first and - surprise!- they hadn't been published anywhere. I won't try to sing and look pretty, Jewel, if you promise not to waste shelf space with more ""poetry"" volumes, 'kay? !"
1,"Oh, Please","Jewel, what were you thinking? Let me guess....your agent mentions a book deal and your eyes turned into dollar signs. Understandable, given your age and inexperience, but surely someone must have tried to talk you out of it? These ""poems"" are nothing but poorly wrought, moony, childish nonsense. ""Sausages slipped from her pockets/I hope she misses them sorely""? Spare me! Even more offensive than your clumsy verse is the cleverly deceptive packaging, making this seem like a substantial literary work. In reality, everything is double or triple spaced, with far too many 2 or 4 line poems. Note to Jewel: Read Dickinson or Poe for lessons in sparse beauty. A Night Without Armor (ooh, clever!) reads like random scraps from a songwriter's notebook--words or phrases that, given time and effort, could have gone on to be good songs. I felt nothing but pain and embarrassment reading this sophomoric schlock. Do yourself a favor, Jewel, and keep it to yourself."
1,Spend your money on REAL poetry,"Yes, I regretfully went through my ""jewel-phase"" about a year ago as most of you reading this probably did. However, I realized when reading this, how totally premature and inane her poetry really is. It would take her a while to seriously develop her ""writing skills"" and the only reason that she recieved so much response to this drivel is the blatant fact that it was written post-pop career. She uses a simple writing style but it soon becomes obvious that it is no more than her inadequacy to go further than that. For example, her poem ""Too Many Nights""--- It's been too many nights of being with to now be suddenly withoutIt may sound OK, maybe for a scattered thought or something to elaborate on, but I wonder if JEWEL even knows what she's saying here.If you're looking for REAL POETRY try somewhere other than here."
1,A question,"Is it bad poetry? Or is it not even poetry at all? I can't decide. But what I really want to know is -- how can so many people out there, who are intelligent enough to use a computer, be hoodwinked by this incompetence?And so I can't refrain, I need to ask the people who wrote in and said ""This is my favorite book of poetry ever"" or some such thing -- I have to ask this: please tell me: what other books of poetry have you read? What are you comparing it to?Anthony Varmint (a_varmint@hotmail.com)"
5,powerful,"Jewel is and always has been a major influence on my writting and my life. No matter what is going on in my life I can turn to her to give me advice and confidence through her music and poetry. She is brilliantly powerful in everything she does and if you love her writting and recorded musci you should see her in concert, there is nothing like it."
1,2 thumbs down,"Take Jewel's name off the cover and you'd assume the poems were written on a napkin by a drunk. They are creative, yes, but far from profound. Far more talent can be found among America's amature poets."
1,Not since William Shatner entered the recording studio...,"Fairness demands that we judge this work on its own merits. So put out of your mind the platinum certifications for ""Pieces of You"". Even go so far as to remove the dust jacket with its enormous, glamourously lit photograph of the poet. (Now if Emily Dickinson had had the sense to do something like that, she might have had more readers.) Open to a random page and see for yourself what verbal deftness, what metric skill, what artistic insight the author commands:""A father and son bond / by ogling my breasts""Hmm. Maybe you better hang on to that dust jacket..."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you want to read good, accessible poetry that anyone can understand, check out Billy Collins. Don't waste your money on this book. Sure, it's poetry. You can call anything poetry. But it's bad poetry. The only reason this was published is because Jewel has a recognizable name and the publishers knew it would make money. Don't reward such blatant bastardizing of the word poetry by supporting their methods and buying this book. For every book out there like this, there's one less book by a good poet. We're already such a celebrity-ruled culture in every other respect, I hate to see the publishing industry go in that direction as well."
1,who are the masses?,"I hate the elitist assumptions of so many reviews that assume this poetry speaks to the masses. Despite what so many people think, people outside the university enjoy quality art. Whether it's poetry, visual art, movies, or music. Come on. Don't disguise your elitism by presuming to speak for the ""masses."" A few poems are ok, but this is nothing great. Poetry takes a lot of revision (despite any false romantic notions of the inspired first thought, best thought artist). A journal entry with line breaks will probobly not be great poetry any more than a camera shooting someone crying for 2 hours is a great movie. Capitalism may not be the best judge of authenticity or quality!"
3,It has it's good points,"I write poetry. And yes, I'm also a Jewel fan. But I read the book expecting alot worse. Jewel's preachiness can be a pain, her obbsession with her breasts, 'bones' and 'flesh' is tiresome, her tone can be whining, but, as a collection of poetry she speaks sincerely and with such empathy for others. A few highlights, 'Lover's for Lilly', 'Father of a deaf girl' 'PS:' 'Forgetful'. This book is not completely without merit. If you're interested go for it."
3,I was interested,"I've never been a big Jewel fan. A friend of mine had the book sitting out and I grabbed it and read the whole thing in one sitting. I was quite impressed with the way she writes. A Night Without Armor is a book I would recommend to others interested in poetry. She's blunt and straight to the point, which is a very good thing. Anyone could enjoy her writing. She gives insight into the world around her and doesn't hold back. My favorites include P.S. and Sara Said. She's honest, that's what I guess I liked."
1,Where's the 0 stars?,"The only people who like this book are the people who liked her music in the first place. I ended up giving it to my boyfriend, who was a fanof hers. He loved it (no kidding). As a person, who is NOT one of her followers, I think it stinks. Stick to music, Jewel!"
2,JEWEL EXPOSES KIDS TO POETRY,"even though I feel uncomfortable with the fact that far superior writers aren't given such lucrative book deals, what Jewel has done is expose many kids to poetry. I think this is good, because hopefully her fans will get ideas in their heads to possibly write their own manuscripts or just begin exploring where poetry can go (maybe read the poems of someone who isn't a rock star or something)."
1,P-U!!,"Man, but this is truly bad. Wise investment by the publishing company though- they've certainly picked plenty of pockets with this one. Can't wait for the follow up! Buy Beau Sia's book instead- at least it's funny and you won't get diabetes from reading it."
1,She's not telling the truth,"Apparently, honesty and poetry don't mix. She has neglected any mention of her early teenage years and the summer she lived with Leroy, her pimp. Maybe she's blocking it out, maybe she's mixing metaphors.I admire courage and truth, that's all."
1,wow...,"i was amazed. I didn't think celebrity writing could get much worse than bob dylan's ""tarantula"" but here it is. the hackneyed imagery and total lack of any sort of emotional rhythm made this book a quite torturous read. the masochists of the poetry world thank you deeply, ms. kilcher"
1,Not Even Close,"She's Beautiful, she's talented but she's definitely NOT a poet. She just scratches the surface of poetry. This THING was obviously not published because of its artistic quality. Just a bunch of people trying to make a few (a lot!) extra bucks."
5,a real poet,"I was disheartened to see some people diss Jewel's poetry. When I went to buy the book, I too thought that it was only published because of her name and that it couldn't be that good, blah, blah, blah. But I was wrong! When I actually sat down and read the poems, it became clear to me very quickly that this is real poetry, not simple little rhymes that anyone can write, or abstract symbolism that no one can understand. Instead, this was intuitive, soulful, and meaningful poetry that spoke to me and impressed me with its colorful use of language, imagery, and metaphor. My favorite poem in this collection is ""God Exists Quietly."" Jewel's poetry is graceful, eloquent, insightful, confessional, spiritual, and above all, genuinely poetic.David Rehakauthor of ""Poems From My Bleeding Heart"""
1,what the hell,"JEWEL IS ON CRACK. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!?""Women who sucktheir cigarettesas though they weregiving theirhatred head""WHAT....?!"
4,"Very enjoyable, but be prepared to read it more then once","This poety book is a wonderful peak into the thoughts of Jewel. This poety gets rather deep and it doesn't rhyme, so if your not into that kind of poety, don't buy this book. It does teach you quite a bit about different kinds of poety."
2,Ho hum,"Like many people young and old, Jewel apparently writes poetry in her spare time. However, she gets to publish it to the world because she is a rock star; and unlike John Lennon's, her poetry isn't all that interesting. Unlike a song lyric, a good poem must necessarily stand on its own as music made out of words - and this flat prose is anything but music."
1,Mawkish,"Someone once wrote about another writer, that they ""write with all the subtlety of a traffic report."" I can't think of a better book to which that sentiment applies than Jewel's."
1,Ewwwwwwww.,"If your sixteen, wear cute tank tops and wide leg jeans, and write bad teenaged love poetry, which if you're considering buying this you probably are, you're beyond my reach. Otherwise, please don't buy this horrible, horrible book."
1,On Jewel,"I was going to be available in stores too,/ I was going to drink whiskey and smoke dope/ Like other kids my age,/ Like kids younger I was going to rageAt the pigs in Alaska and the parents who raised me,/ The teachers and the soccer moms and absent fathers working too long./ I was going write poems and be famous,/ I was going far in my bejeweled white skin/That burned if I were too long in the sun/ And at high altitudes,/ I was going to send emails to all my friends/ And feel things others felt and explain/In lines of poetry about how these/ Things were so very true,/ I was going to wear sparkling clothing/ I was going to read to crowds of people/And have them applaud me,/ I was going to too."
5,One Word...........GREAT!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best book.....this is not a book that relates to one group of people...it relates to everyone. Love it, Love it, Love it. JEWEL ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,She's too honest.,"Okay. I like her songs. But I must say, the poems Jewel wrote were not really good. Subjects are almost related to love, guys, and her breasts. It's like NC-17!!! Needs parental guidance!!!! She's too honest to herself. That's why some people like this book and others ane not."
5,I never liked poetry until now.,"I always said I hated reading poetry, but when I saw Jewel's book at the book store, I picked it up and flipped through. Now and friend and I are highlighting our favorite lines and comparing notes. It's great. I love her style of writing, like her songs."
3,A good effort,"There were quite a few poems I did like. But overall, this collection was boring. I think she should stick to singing."
4,well done,"I enjoyed Jewels poetry, it was really a delight to read. She has a wonderful soul as shown through her writing and I encourage her to continue."
5,Spoken from the Heart,"One of the things I like most about Jewel's music and poetry is the feeling of honesty in the words. Anyone who reveals so much of themselves in their art is going to be attacked. Sad but true. I personally believe that Jewel is to be applauded for putting so much of herself on the line. Speaking as a poet myself, I believe the most important thing is that you say what your feel not whether your poetry rhymes or contains allusions to breasts are whatever. Yes I will confess that there is better written poetry around (Poe, Kerouac, Blake, Bukowski etc) but then so what? I read poetry for the emotion not for the writing."
2,What Were You Expecting? Emily Dickinson?,"Of course this book [stinks]. But what do you expect from someone who:1. Sings songs with lyrics that go: ""I got my eggs I got my pancakes too/I got my maple syrup/Everything but you""2. Has had her ego pampered for a very long time3. Takes herself so seriously4. Is under the age of 30Hmm?And yes, it is awful that she sells so many copies... just because she's famous while true poets are still looking for a publisher, but if you're so concerned, then do what I did and get it from the library instead of rushing out to buy it.It's not worth cash anyway."
1,An interpretation,"That's a very interesting title, as many of you may have noticed. A Night Without Armor, as a review said once, supposedly referred to the fact that she always wrote at night. What this has to do with armor stupifies me. She probably added the 'without armor' to make it seem as if she were a knight(?), which, I find, is very wrong. Enjoy the analysis: the title of the book is the deepest this collection of 'poetry' ever gets."
1,Ramblings do not equal literature,"The best thing about this collection of myopic, solipsistic observations is that it eventually ends. Self-disclosure is boring. And the similies are like . . . well, I'm tempted to use a typically inept Jewel-ism but I'll just say they're bad. Don't waste your time. Pick up Yeats instead. And if you must READ a MUSICIAN, consider the complete Dylan lyrics . . ."
2,Its not Shakespeare ...,"Jewel Kilcher is a fine musician, but leaves something to be desired as a poet. Some of her work is touching, many perhaps personally relevant, but most are, well ... substandard. As a previous reviewer mentioned, this work needs to be judged on its own merits. And in doing so, I found it lacking."
3,Some of her poems touched me when I read them.,"There are a few poems in this book which really touched me at the time that I read them. Others did not appeal to me at all. That's the great thing about poetry it either speaks to you or it does not. It is a very personal thing. I give Jewel credit for pouring her heart into her poems and then releasing them for the world to see, I do however prefer her music to her writing."
4,Suprisingly interesting,"I picked up this book of poetry off a sale table in the local book store, not at all sure what to expect. As a young woman, close to the author's age, I found her work surprisingly moving. Her poems are an origional emotional barage, touching and full of sting, whitty and reflective, intelligent yet youthful.I particullarly enjoyed the fact that the poetry seems to stem from all parts of her life: family, career, love, adolescence, childhood. If you're looking for something fresh, this is a wonderful composition of poetry to pick up."
3,it's not fair,"I liked the book, don't get me wrong. I just know how hard it is to get poetry published and I don't think this book would have ever had a chance of being published if it were not for Jewel's celebrity status. It's not that it was bad, it's just that I could have saved the money it took to buy it and just read any high schooler's diary. I think there are a lot of really good poets out there that deserve the chance to be published and I just don't think it's fair that people would publish lesser work just because of someone's fame."
1,GROSS!,"I can't believe they don't let you put zero stars on this thing. I thought this book was the most horrible and repulsive book I've ever read! I don't mind her music, it's okay, but this book, ugh, I can't even find words horrible enough to describe it. I got the book for a gift. I thought okay I'll read a poem and if I don't like it, I'll take it back. I read one poem and threw the book in the garbage. It was to bad to go back in the store. If some people like it I don't mind but I hated it."
1,There's no poetry here!,"I was outraged after reading Jewe's book. I was looking forward to this book, after enjoying her first album. I was so disappointed that she turned out to be so shallow! Her work isn't even poetry. I feel like I got ripped off. I read a lot of poetry and I'm telling you, this isn't anything like real poetry. Please don't support this kind of garbage. This book is just another example of how superstars try to make a quick buck."
3,Not bad,"Jewel seems headed in the right direction, I'm sure her next book will be better. She seems sincere in the themes, both obvious (sex, abandonment, loneliness, heartache), and the more subtle ones (masturbation, drugs)-these last 2 are just the interpretations of me and some friends, we could be way off. But some of the poems just seem thrown together for the sake of completing the book. Not bad, though."
1,A Girl Without Talent,"How low can you go? According to Jewel, pretty low. This stuff sounds less like poetry and more like someone babbling to themeslf about their own greatness!!!! This actually offends me. I read tons of poetry and I can guarentee that Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost are ROLLING in their graves over this. Jewel already thinks she's the greatest singer known to mankind - now she's a poet too????? She is talentless. All she has is an angle. And I'm 13, so cut all this crud about only old people hating her!!! (And if I hear ""Hands"" one more time I will commit justifiuable homicide!!!!!)"
1,"Definitely not an inspirational book, lacks beauty of form","I purchased this book(s)for my daughter and niece for Christmas, naively believing it would be comparable to her music. My mistake, another one learned in this life. This book is composed of certain material that I knowingly cannot condone or submit to them to read, or better yet classify as ""good poetry"". Literature it is not !!! This book sets a terrible example for our youth and by excepting it we help to contribute to the immorality of our society."
1,Perhaps Barbi on Prozac?,"This book is an insult to literature and serious poets et al. It reads like an angst ridden teenaged girls diary in stanza form. It insults ones intelligence and the emotional state of women, and leaves one feeling a sense of mental indigestion. If only they made Mylanta for the soul, I would suggest a prescription for the author."
1,"Doesn't take much to get called poetry these days, huh?","What's with all these 2-5 line poems taking up a whole page on a book? I used to try that trick in school, you know... write bigger and hopefully the teacher will give you credit for having written a 12 page essay which really should have taken up 6 pages.This book is an insult to those who have studied real poetry, and appreciate real poetry. I am glad this was a borrowed book. All it takes is a record deal and a few whiny angsty lines on a page and bada-bing... ""poetry"".I have nothing against modern poetry in general, and the creativity and the lack of rigidity in poems these days, but how low do you have to sink? There are still fresh ideas left in the world, and poetry to be written about it.If you absolutely must see these poems, use your library card, not your wallet."
1,File under comedy,"I am ashamed to call myself a poet if I have to share the word with the likes of Jewel here, who, without her pretty face and hit records, would still be sneaking these scraps of half-formed ideas and banal observations under her boyfriend's pillow every night before he got home from drinking. Everybody in the world has ideas and opinions on things, and they have every right to them, but only a few have the talent and CRAFT (this is something Ms. Kilcher should really explore) to construct poems and songs and stories and plays that can stand up to the scrutiny of outside (adult) observers as well as the test of time. Judging by the gushing, breathless reviews this volume has received, one can only conclude that a lot of thirteen year old girls have been dragging Jewel along to the beach this summer."
2,Like paying for scraps of paper,"Much of the poetry in Jewel's book is beautiful and moving. She clearly has a way of turning word into image and emotion. However, I could not help but get the feeling that Armor was put together from discarded ideas for song lyrics and unfinished thought, as a way to wring a few extra bucks out. This was only reinforced when I heard some of the same lines in the songs on her second studio album. Save your money - even if you like it, you won't find yourself missing it after."
1,How?,"After reading this one question lingures in my mind: How ever did Jewel manage to get this published? Jewel seems nice and has great music, but her poetry can not live up to that, I write better: ""What werer you thinking? Seems like you were drinking, After writing this book, You sure had good luck, Could the publisher read? Because your poetry we do not need!"" So im not a world famous poet, but if you think that was bad, then you realy dont want to read this, if you want to get inside Jewels mind then you want this, but if your looking for poetry, look else where."
5,Great reading.,"Great reading even if you're not an avid poetry fan. EVERY young woman in America should read Jewel's poem ""Sara Said"" before going out on a date."
3,All that glitters is not Jewel,"The best page of this book is the cover. Jewel is hot, hot, hot. But her poetry is not, not, not. Do what I wish I had done: download the picture and buy a different book."
4,I liked it,"I think this is a good poetry book and anyone who likes Jewel's music will probably enjoy this. O.K. so she's not a professional poet, but she's honest and she's talented. Some of the poems are a little corny, but others are really good. I think this book shows more of Jewel than any interview could. So if you want to know more about her, read it."
3,Choppy recording,Good music but some tracks have abrupt stops or breaks in the recording which makes it sound choppy or like skipping. MP3 conversion seems to accentuate this even. Still I dont think its possible to find authentic 3rd Reich choral marches anywhere else so ***
4,Landser Marches,"This CD is a nice compilation of authentic marches. Some complain that the sound quality is less than perfect but they forget that they recordings were made during the 1930 and 1940, long before the advent of hi-fidelity. However, the CD's sound quality is more than adequate to listen to. The CD has a nice cover. I only wish that the CD contained an insert with the lyrics and English translation of the marches."
4,A Blast From Our Past,"Very interesting recordings. Thanks to the digital revolution, us Baby Boomers and their children can now hear the music of another era, that will never be broadcast on public radio stations. My one complaint is that, perhaps, the sound quality could have been improved by using the original source tapes, if available."
2,It Is What It Is,"I'm really not that happy with this music. Don't know what I was thinking when I bought it, and I'm very glad I didn't buy more than one CD from the set ... there is a CD of Luftwaffe marches, a CD of Panzer marches, Kriegsmarine marches, Landser Marches II, etc.Obviously the Nazis just loved, loved, loved to sing and march and kill.As one might expect, the recordings, singers and musicains are all rather low quality. Mono recordings of the great orchestras and conductors from the 1940s and 1950s are also rather poor.I'm much happier with a Deutsche Grammophon recording of Marches. It contains two CDs, and costs the same as landser Marches. Herbert von Karajan conducts the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Octet for most of the selections. ASIN: B000001GLC."
1,Shifting language? Errington is simply shifty.,"Errington strikes again. In this book Errington repeats his sophomoric fallacies of ignoring all established theories on the subject. His own theories entangled in his convoluted and verbose prose seem to exist more to contradict the foundations of anthropological though such as Steven Pinker's, than to offer intelligent and reasonable alternatives. Academia is not a sandbox, and Errington should stop kicking over big kids' sandcastles."
5,Cash saver,"For those who run into check engine lights on their WRX, this might just be your fix. Unfortunately, the front O2 sensor is the air/fuel reader and costs a lot of money at the dealer. Buying from these guys saved me a lot of money. No need to price shop. Fast shipping too.rik[...]"
4,Worked good for me,Worked well on my Canon S70 (with filter adapter). Was able to take some nice telephoto shots with it.
1,Tiffen 2x zoom,"The view through this lense shows a round, dark border, like looking through a hole in a fence. I sent it back, and my card was promptly credited."
3,A technique filled book only usefull for advanced practioners,This book is not really my fav because it really doesn't detail the principals of the art to well.Total Aikido: The Master Course (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)is a much better book if you want to learn aikido as this book is purely for advanced practioners and only useful for the advanced grappler.
4,a good introduction to the art...,"This serves as a fine introduction into one of the oldest martial arts and systems of Japan, with a brief history and some explanation as well as some demonstrated techniques."
3,Very Basic Info,"If you've played this game for an hour, you will already know 99% of ehat they write about in this book. My expectation was for that of a STRATEGY guide, not a ""how to""."
5,helped me so much,this book is a great guide and it really help me understand more of the game. since im new to sims i had to buy 2 games(sims and hot date) this book intrudced me to the world of sims! thankyou hot date it feels good to date
4,Hot Date strategy guide review,"I found the list explaining the new characters and new social interactions very useful. The object list is very basic (original Sims and Hot Date objects only), and you can find things like the cheats on fan sites easily. However, it was also useful in keeping track of which objects were original Maxis objects since I have collected so many fan site objects now! I was, however, somewhat disappointed that no living large objects or house party objects were mentioned in this guide. Then again, it is possible to own hot date without ever having owned living large, SIMS DELUXE, or house party. (Not as much fun though, and if you purchase these expansion packs later, chances are you will have to reinstall your game (be sure to back up your neighborhoods and downloaded custom objects, skins, walls, floors etc. first BEFORE reinstalling). So I recommend to get the prior expansion packs first to avoid the hassle of reinstalling.)"
1,what a waste of money,"Save your money, for the price I thought that I would at least find out more information that what is offered on Wikipedia. What a complete and total rip-off. I should be able to get a refund for this garbage. To say that I'm disappointed and disgusted would be understating it!"
3,lighted snowman,THIS IS A REPLACEMENT ONE. THE FIRST ONLY LASTED ONE YEAR THAN NOTHING WOULD LIGHT UP HOPE THIS ONE LASTS LONGER
2,High Expectations,The best feature of the book is the diagrams of each disease process on the cellular level. The care plans are broad and limited. Under each disease there may be a list of four nursing diagnoses followed by a list of seven interventions with no discussion of which intervention relates to which diagnosis. Too broad and general. Not worth the price.
1,"CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP",For 13.95 all you get is a PLASTIC paint coated piece of junk....... Very deceiving to say the least.
3,Nothing special,"This is a light-weight plastic hitch cover. It feels flimsy--infact, the packaging (which is extremely hard to get into) is probably more durable than the item itself. However, it is in expensive, fits well, and serves its purpose. That said, I think I would prefer a metal, or at least a stronger/thicker plastic cover."
1,Not Real Flag,"I ordered the Nation of Islam flag 3 times from this merchant. The first time, I didn't notice it was simply the Turkish flag flipped backwards (until someone who visited my home told me--embarrassing). Then, I did a search for the Nation of Islam flag and found it on here. The picture misleads the buyers. In the picture, it shows the actual Nation of Islam flag (the pole thing is on the left side and the flag is correct). On the other hand, when I received the 2 flags I ordered, the pole thing has to be on the right side in order for the flag to look correct (with subtle differences--bigger star, less enclosed crescent moon, etc.). So, the picture lies. I ended up with 3 Turkish flags that I have to pin on my wall backwards in order to pass it off as the Nation of Islam flag. Embarrassing."
5,Exactly what I needed,My mp3 player in my car is hooked through my car DVD player with this. My old cord was shorting out and this fixed everything! Great price. Perfect for my needs :)
5,It Is What It Is,"You can't really review one of these cables. Either they work or they don't, this one does and that's about it. If you know what you're doing, it'll last."
3,Looks fine. Sounds bad,"built fine. worked well for a while. then, volume on one of the channels dropped. not worth it. i'd spend a few more bucks and get a good one"
1,Beware of ordering this from Cmple.com,"I recently ordered this from Cmple.com (third party seller) through the Amazon website. I thought I had ordered the Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs, however, when the order came, it had a packaging of a plastic bag with no Belkin labels or packaging. In other words - how do I know if this was a true ""Belkin"" product or just a generic brand?? Also, the order did not include a packaging invoice, which led me even more to believe that this was a generic product.So, I e-mailed Cmple.com through Amazon. They did not address my issues regarding the order. They did however refund me. I decided to check Cmple.com's website to see if they had any Belkin products - they did not. So, what did I learn? It appears they misrepresented what they were selling on Amazon! Beware of Cmple.com!"
2,It is not a Belkin one...,It is not a Belkin one. It is some local brand which you can get it even from the dollar shop. I am keeping mine because I will not get anything if want to return.
5,sounds great; works great,"Ordered this so my son can hook up his Ipod to my quality twenty year old stereo and he loves it. Easy to hook up, the chord is just long enough. Wire coating seems strong."
3,its okay,its okay but just saying on the carpet out of harms way it has a slit in the protective sleeve. either from that or just from it not being great quality it sometimes cuts out like a skip from a cd.i would spend a little more and try for better quality if i were you
2,NO GOOD,"So far this product has been worthless, I bought this to plug my computer into my tv to listen to music or play sound from movies. I'm attempting to use it in conjunction with the Mini-DVI to HDMI converter and I have had zero luck. I've tried this Y cable in multiple configurations and it has failed every single time. I'm still hoping that there is some user error thing going on here. I will be contacting the manufacturer soon and updating my review."
1,JUNK,"I've been satisfied with Belkin products, maybe just this one is defective.You get what you pay for.. You may want to opt for a Monster.Any flexing around the miniplug causes static..Not worth the effort of cost/time to return it."
3,U get what u pay for,I agree its cheap and it works but the doesn't connect to my iPod snugly. Will get the Monster instead
4,Good enough,"Wow so I have to write 20+ words?....thats annoying. But any way, this cable works well, however, customers really need an instruction book somewhere to learn how to connect these cables to their computers...they are complicated trust me."
5,Handy cable,"Can use for laptop to tv playback, or from cassette player to computer to record old cassettes to CD, Iphone, or mp3 player."
5,As Described,"There is not much to say here, except that this is the perfect cable for hooking up a laptop/ipod/tablet to a home theater system. Works flawlessly, and seems to be a pretty high quality cable."
5,can't beat it,"For the price of this compared to local stores, this is a very excellent product. Most PC stores will charge twice as much, or a little over even for the same product. I was very happy with this product."
5,Great Price and Works!,I used this to connect the RCA Audio out from the old CRT TV to the Audio In of my music system and it works great. The cable feels great as well (i.e doesn't look cheap although the price is cheap).
3,buyer be aware,"if you have a case for your iphone, and the top has the holes for the 3mm jack, this wire will not fit!"
4,Belkin audio Y cable,The Y cord is just as I wanted. The sound quality is off a PC to LCD TV - the sound is just as if it was an HD movie form a CD. Great deal.
5,Just what I was looking for,"Just what I was looking for to connect my IPOD NANO into the AUX RCA jacks of my stereo, and in our mini van. A great price even with shipping costs. This method does not produce the volume that I hoped for, but I was warned about that. The volume is still adequate for most situations."
2,did not work for me,The connector was very loose in my iPod Touch (fine in my stereo). Could not get good sound; sounded like the music was playing underwater. Tried a couple different stereo ports. Oh well!
5,works well,"I'm no audiophile, so I can not judge the sound quality. It sounds just fine to me. The adapter doesn't ""feel"" overly well built or sturdy, but it works fine and does not seem to want to fall apart easily."
2,"It works, kind of","I suppose you get what you pay for. I recently restored an old stereo from c.1975 and wanted to play some music from my computer on it. This cheap Y-cable appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. As it turns out, it works pretty well. The sound is good. A word of advice, however: once you plug it in and turn on your stereo, DO NOT TOUCH THE CABLE. For some reason, the cable doesn't fit into my computer's speaker output very well (Macbook pro). And since the output is on the left side, in front of the USB ports and the charger port, I found myself accidentally brushing up against the cable a bunch of times. When this happens, you hear a loud POP sound like a gunshot. My ears are still ringing from this. In the future, I will hook up the cable to my iPod, and put the iPod away so that I won't accidentally touch the cable. Or maybe I'll just buy a new cable that works better."
4,Good standard cable,I needed a cable to connect my MacBookPro to my TV for sound. This does the job fine for a great price.
1,Did not work for me at all.,"I bought this Cable with the intention of connecting my Toshiba (Satellite)Laptop to my HD Samsung TV. After success with viewing the video through a VGA laptop to tv cable connection, my spirits were high but short-lived. After Connecting the Y audio cable from laptop to tv, i was saddened to find that there was no audio coming from television when playing a youtube video from my laptop. i could see said video but no sound, at all. Please help if you have any suggestions on how i can troubleshoot this problem if such a way exists. I don't want to buy another wire and have to wait another several days to receive it. In order to view video i have my input set to pc so does it matter that i connect through RCA red and white audio inputs. please help..."
3,Possibly not really a Belkin device.,"The cable works as advertised; however, I have doubts that this is actually a Belkin cable. It certainly did not come in the packaging advertised (it showed up in a small plastic bag with no identifying markings whatsoever). It works and it's cheap. If you're an audiophile, this probably isn't for you. If you're someone who just wants to hook up your laptop to your tv every once in a while, then this is what you need."
2,"I think its me, not the cord...but I can't be sure!","I bought this cable to hook my macbook the tv so I can get sound for the dvd player. I have the mini displayport to hdmi adapter, but my macbook is from 2009, so it still doesn't transmit the sound. I bought this cable for the sound, but when I hook it up, it still doesn't have sound. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. The only thing I can figure out is that when I hook these cables up its where the ""video 2"" hookup is, and when the hdmi goes in, its the ""hdmi 3""...so two different components on my tv input. But, there aren't any rca plugs with the hdmi (obviously, since its supposed to carry audio as well). Any advice??"
4,"works fine, no problems","Well, what can I say, it's a cable and it works. No problems whatsoever. Not sure what else to say here."
4,good for the price,Had it for about a month now and works fine. Nothing fancy but does the job. Use it in my car as it didnt have a 3.5 mm jack but had rca connectors
5,Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6 Feet),i got this to go with the VGA to HDMI cable I'm sure it works good but my laptop is a pos lolI did give a five star for being fast delivery and new cond.
5,Perfect for FLAT SCREEN/STEREO connection!,"Previously connected one component (DVD, VHS, Cable Box) at a time to my old tube TV then stereo. This product connected to the mini plug on my new 60"" flat screen, then into my R and L-audio on my stereo, and any component attached to the TV now comes through the auxiliary mode on my stereo. Awesome!"
3,"Good product, but not what I needed",The product is good and delivery was prompt. I found I needed a special cord with something built it to reduce audio hum.
3,audio Y cable splitter,"I purchased the wrong item, but it turned out ok - someone at the office needed it anyway! Otherwise it would not have been worth returning - the price was too low to warrant a return."
5,"If You Own An iPod, BUY THIS PRODUCT","This is simply just a cable to connect your iPod to your home stereo, as long as your home stereo has available RCA's (I don't know of any made in the last 5 years that don't). With that said, I've seen a product that does exactly the same thing at Best Buy for $30... Don't get hustled into the overpriced iPod-labeled accessories. Just buy this one, it does exactly the same thing for a quarter of the price."
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought these a few months ago and three weeks later they already had channel separation issues. The right side would cut in and out, much to the chagrin of my poor tweeters.Interestingly, I note that the two one-star reviews had the same issue, both with the right channel. A bad mold at the factory, perhaps. It can really hurt your ears and system when that stuff crackles and cuts in and out at volume. Not good.The cables sound ok, but if they don't work who cares?"
5,"Works great, just feels like it's going to fall apart.","It works very well, and is still working perfectly. It just has this feel, though, that it's going fall apart, though it hasn't which is good.I haven't used them enough to determine long term wear, but if you aren't hard on them they should be fine."
5,Gets the job done at a price that can't be beat,"I bought these cables as a quick fix to replace some that went missing from my fraternity house. Being the engineering nerds that we are (it's an engineering fraternity), we spend more time watching B-movies than we do watching sporting events. We usually have a laptop hooked up to a TV, but using laptop speakers for audio just doesn't cut it. Since the cables weren't for me, I didn't want to spend a whole lot. After getting these cables and testing them out on my sound system at home (using both my DSi and MP3 player), I can say that I am extremely pleased by their performance.tl;drSounds great so farVery reasonably pricedBought as a quick fix, but will likely continue to use them for many other thingsAlso, this is my first review. It's not as polished as I would like for it to be, but you have to start somewhere, right?"
2,Mediocre,"Simply stated if you care about sound DO NOT buy this cable. All I get is a white noise sound most of the time and I have to max the sound on my 1000 watt system just to hear any music from my iPod... It does work for iPods, but the sound transfer is awful. Buyer beware with this item."
2,great...for 33 days,"Adapter seems durable, seems nice, slight bluish tinge to the color. I bought this hoping to replace some cords that I had that were going out, buying Belkin I thought that surely it would be worth it, as the reviews also state. unfortunately, I'm just an unhappy customer, my luck was simply bad. The cord went out at 33 days, 3 days after the return period/warranty expired. It had a short right at the headphone plug. Wasn't misused, sat in the same place most of the time, taken out a few times a week.Just an unhappy customer, I'm sure this would work great if you plan on never moving the cable. otherwise-be wary, likely 70% of the reviews on here don't move the cords around and thus don't have the same problem I had.Did not work as a cord past 33 days, but worked great as a rope and/or spare wire!"
5,Does the Job,"I used this in combination to Auxilary input for my 2005 Honda Accord, and it works great! It's long enough to go from the inside of my console to my passenger seat, where I set my MP3 player, and then some! Good for applications where you need a lot of cable..."
5,cheap and works well!,this cable was cheap and well made it sounds great no static or distortion. i used it in my vehicle with a special aux adapter
5,As it should be....,This product does exactly what it's supposed to do and does it well. Shipped very quickly too..Perfect in all ways. What more could I say....
2,Splitter,Use this to connect cell phone to receiver (Pandora). Easy and convenient. Inexpensive solution to receiving and listening to free music via internet.
3,plastic around headphone jack is HUGE,"Don't expect to use this with a phone that is wearing a case. It has a HUGE plastic surround near the headphone jack. It works well, but might not work in situations where a slim headphone jack is needed. I'm using it for now, but looking out for a replacement."
2,HELP!,I can't hear anything through my tv!! What am I doing wrong?? I'm using a dell latitude D600. Please Help
2,Volume had to be turned up very high to hear,"I primarily bought this cable to stream from the Amazon MP3 app on my cellphone to my stereo. I tested this cable with my laptop, cellphone and Zune. With each device the volume had to be turned up very high on the device and the stereo to actually get a decent volume. Also if the Belkin Audio Y Cable was touched a lot of static noise resulted. With the cellphone and Zune I had to remove the protective covers because the audio jack on the cable would not stay connected otherwise. Audio quality is just OK but it's RCA, so no surprise. So I'd rate this cable as just OK because of the volume and static issues.In terms of comparing the volume and sound quality, I use a Belkin Xm Auto Cassette Adapter in my car with my cellphone and Zune. With the Belkin Xm Auto Cassette Adapter, audio is crystal clear and very loud at a low volume setting for both the cellphone and the Zune."
3,Didn't work on my Sony Bravia...,The cables didn't work with my new Sony Bravia... they did however work with my old school 1996 Toshiba TV... not sure what thats all about.
5,"Cheap, Durable, And Works Well","For those who are not sure what this product does...it connects a single headphone jack (found on portable audio equipment) to right/left audio jack connectors on an audio receiver. So if your looking to hook up say your mp3 player or portable cd player to the receiver of your home stereo system look no further, you've found the right product.I use this Belkin splitter to attach my muvo (mp3 flash player) and ,sometimes, my mp3 portable iriver cd player to my stereo system. Works great. I don't have a problem with the connection being loose, but I don't have an ipod to test this out with. My mp3 cd players and the few flash mp3 players I've tried work fine with this. Belkin, as usual, offers a quality product.Cheap, works well, recommended."
2,HUGE flaw; impractical for common use.,"This cable is basically like all the other Y-cable splitters I've used. It does what it's intended to do, and, like all the others, it also has some issues...only this one had more issues than the others.Pros:* 6 feet long* Sturdy construction by Belkin* Decent audio qualityCons:* VIRTUALLY NO ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING. THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A COMPUTER, CELL PHONE, TV, VGA CABLE, ETC. NEAR IT, IT WILL CREATE A TON OF NOISE.* As usual, audio distorts horribly when the output device is at 50% volume on the mini plug jack* Not gold plated, and the red and white plugs are not as long as standard RCA plugs (though that's really just cosmetic)The lack of good electromagnetic shielding was a real deal-breaker for me. Though the audio quality is OK and the length is good, the fact that my TV and VGA cable caused noise with the cable made it completely unusable.I would recommend against getting this product."
4,Great Cable but Not what I needed!!!,"This cable is great but not what I needed, some if not most LCD HD TVs cannotcombine this audio (analog through video input) with digital HDMI output, or Monitor PC output.So beware! unless you want all analog video and audio through your laptop output, then do not buy this,Unless you want to connect a 3.5 jack device to larger speakers etc.I found a newer solution to my Macbook to TV problem,I hooked up the Mini DVI to HDMI cable fine, beautiful output...and then connected usb powered and 3.5 jack compatiblespeakers to my Macbook, and boom video and audio."
2,Belkin Y-Cable,Sound quality is very poor with this cable. I hooked it up directly to the sound bar attached to my TV. When I played music I heard a lot of rattling which disturbed the whole flow of the music. I just play music through my PS3 now and the sound quality is much improved.
2,Didn't work,"Good price, received it as described and fast shipping. However, it didn't work! I purchased it to connect my PC Compaq to my LCD TV, for the sound, but nothing happened! no sound! I just chose to keep it because it was not worth it to return it, it might work for a stereo system, but I have not tried that yet! I think the seller should say in the description to what systems it works and to what it doesn't!"
4,good product,"good product. I wouldn't expect anything else from Belkin. No problems, processed and shipped quickly. I would recommend this item."
5,Laptop to Surround Sound System,"Works very well, sound quality seems to be good, home theater system is over 10 years old. I would recommend this product to everyone."
5,What I wanted,"Very nice product worked as intended good price love it, that is all that I have to say about this product!"
5,It's a cable!,It's a headphone jack to RCA audio splitter cable.You probably know what it does.It works.Life is good.
3,The Twist,"I bought this CD so I could hear the original version of The Twist as I had never heard it. For me it is a ""collector's"" item as it is not available in Sydney. The original Twist receives no airplay. The sound is typical of its time. I enjoyed it. The CD is ""Blues"" & most of the tracks are enjoyable. I don't think the CD would be to everyones liking."
2,For Mom,"I bought this for Mother's day, I think. My mom had to stop wearing it after a while because the clasp kept snagging on to the bed sheets or blanket and started getting loose. She changed the clasp and it worked better. My mom liked it and that's all that matters but she hasn't worn in a while. So maybe not as good as advertised."
4,OK this is it,"From the people who brought you Kava Kava and Ginseng, comes Ginkgo Biloba. This disc is supposed to make you more focused and clear. I noticed no such benefit. The music is very nice though. This series does make me wonder if they will be releasing other series, how about a vitamin series? Or a Garlic disc they could call ""The Stinking Rose, music to make you less prone to heart attacks."" I can't wait for the prescription drug series. And I think the entire city of San Francisco is waiting with baited breath for the Marijuana disc. No not the Pink Floyd disc, and no, not the Jefferson Airplane disc. As an herbal supplement, the disc bombs. It is too big to swallow, and the music puts you to sleep. As a New Age album, this is a solid if somewhat cliche offering."
5,"If you can only buy one retriever training book, buy this!","After 21 years training rare retrievers (The Curly Coated), I found this book to be the most helpful I've ever read. Spencer actually recognizes that there are differences not only in the retriever breeds but among individuals in those breeds. A very wonderful book full of practical, down-to-earth training methods written by an author who recognizes dog training is an art, not a science. Will someday be on the dog training classics shelf along with James Lamb Free and others."
1,Do not purchase this modem,"I have purchased this creativelabs DI5633 modem, Installed the windows XP drivers from creative labs and the modem will not work. However Aquery of the modem in modem's properties Is successful. If you delete the modem, windows xp will install its generic 56K modem drivers, which works temporarily, but it consistantly loses internet connection. Please stay away from this one"
2,"Reliable, at least","The Creative Labs V9.2 is a good value. Pop it in and it works dependably out of the box the first time and every time. I couldn't say that about a more expensive type. If you want to go on line without an installation hassle, this is your modem. My Win XP recognized and installed it at power up, a second later I was on line with AOL for the first time. Simply, dependably."
1,Very Slow,"I bought this modem with the anticipation of a little faster hook up than my original v-90. However, I was very disappointed in the speed and most of the websites I would go to never fully loaded. After running some diagnostics and upgrading whatever software I could, there was still no improvement. I sent it back and bought a cheaper US Robotics which works great"
3,OKAY,"I bought a Creative Modem Blaster External Serial a while ago (I don't remember when.) At first I couldn't get the Netwaiting to work right, even though I have call waiting and caller id. But later I reinstalled it and it worked. And for some reson Netwaiting doesn't work again (I've been downloading many things such as a new Opera browser.) But It was great while it lasted. However the faxing software doesn't work when you're using the modem to connect to the internet. This is great if you know how to download it. Also beware when upgrading your computer."
1,This modem ...,I have try this modem on 2 computers with xp and one with 2000 pro. I have updated drivers and it DOES NOT work. If it does dial up then it will just lock up my computer. I highly recommend you don't waste your time with this modem.
2,Conflict,I could not get this device to work under windows ME but had minimal problems with Windows 2000
1,The worst modem I ever have,"This is the worst modem I ever have, I will give it 0 if I can.1. The driver totally doesn't work on Win2K, simply didn't dial (query modem looks fine) and froze the machine.2. Incredible unstable connection, on Win98, 80% chance you got 14.4Kb with this so called ""V.92""! My phone line is perfect, my laptop and my old ISA modem all get 50K+ consistently.3. No manual, no support.Don't touch this garbage. I get a $15 no name modem and works perfectly."
4,Works great.,"This one works. I've tried many Headsets (10) on my Panasonic wireless model KX-TG6541 phone, most of which no one could hear me on. With this headset I can hear others and they can hear me clearly. I bought 2. Cost a little more than expected for the way it's made."
4,Panasonic Headset,"Sent to my daughter as a gift for she was complaining about neck pain from cradling the phone on her neck and shoulders. She is quite happy with the headset. Loud, clear, and comfortable is our feedback."
4,review of Panasonic KX-TCA88,"I like this headset a lot. It doesn't have a mute button, or a volume control, but the phone has these so they are not really necessary. The impedance of this headset matches the impedance of the phone well enough that I can usually use the headset with the phone volume turned all the way down. This saves on battery power allowing it to last longer. I can actually hear better with the headset than I can using the phone directly."
3,wanted more,I hoped that this would be an objective summary of the schiavo storyinstead its simply ONE show with the geentleman who was her guardianwhile he did supply some fresh insite and new infothis was too briefI would not buy this unless you are really studying the topicotherwise NOT worthit
2,Keep looking,I bought this as a way to upgrade my laptop so that I could run my new USB2.0 external HDD. The included CD doesn't even carry the needed software to run the card it instead directs you to Orange Micro's website to download thier latest and greatest drivers. On top of that for the past 3 weeks I have used this I still run across WinXP's warning boxes telling me that I need to reinstall the software since the drivers disappear. Finally the need to attach an external AC adapter to run anything attached to the cards ports is kind of hard to take as well. In my computer I need the AC Adapter plugged in to keep the card running or else WinXP shuts the card down since it is too much of a power drain. If you are looking for a way to upgrade your computer using a PCMIA card don't look at this one. Keep looking there have to be some better ones out there.
3,Requires external power supply,"You've got to plug in the AC adapter if you're hoping to run a non-self-powered device from it. My mouse works with the built-in port in my laptop, but I get an error if I plug it into the cardbus port. I got it paritally cuz it's smaller than a hub which I currently need to run both my mouse and wacom. But since I gotta carry the AC adapter as well, I'm returning this product, will just go back to the hub, and will continue looking for a usb cardbus card that doesn't require an AC adapter for non-powered devices."
2,Really boring,"I am very disappointed in Dieux du Stade: Making 2005 Calendar. The filming, photos, and the players for Making 2004 Calendar were so much better. They had lots of great energy in contrast to the extremely boring energy in 2005. I'm hesitant to buy Dieus du State: Making 2006 Calendar DVD. I am concerned it might be even more boing than 2005.What happened guys?"
2,They are too shy to be real men,Out of the 48 models only 4 show full frontal nudity shots. You can look at genitals of another 5 if you use the zoom function creatively.I thought these people were real men and thus not afraid to show their bodies. I was wrong. The models are extremely shy with few exceptions. Somebody should tell them that they are not judged by the size of the soft members. [...].I found about 10% of the models attractive. Julian Hans was one of them but sadly he is as shy as most of them.Alexis Driollet is one of the few good one who shows it all.
1,Terminally Boring,"Here we see how many ways a naked man can cover his crotch (3, if holding a football-4). And we see them over and over and over again.I assume the whole series sucks - I've fast-forwarded through two and that's plenty.I'd rather watch the guys play rugby!"
4,In color but not as provacative,"This year's DIEUX is as stunning as the 2004 edition.The models are photographed in color but somehow it loses something from the beautiful black and white of the previous year.There is no dialogue, only music underneath the footage.I miss the interaction between the models and the photographers. This plays more like MTV.And can you believe someone actually gets paid $ to apply makeup to the butts of these guys, while another strategically places sand on his cheeks.Talk about loving your job!"
5,A fun time for all!,"I read about (and saw!) Dieux Du Stade in Playgirl magazine this summer. So I decided to pick-up the 2005 DVD. I have really enjoyed it and I have now shown it to most of my friends - a couple of them bought one for themselves too! We laugh and giggle and scream and make ""toasts"" when our favorite one comes on screen. Such beautiful men! I may have to take a trip to Paris one day just to see the team play!The DVD is sexy and erotic without being embarrassingly ""in your face"". After buying the 2005 DVD, I bought the 2004 DVD. This DVD is really great too. I really love how it begins with the music and its filmed in black & white and of course is filled with gorgoeous man after man.I can't wait to see the 2006 DVD!"
3,Worth reading but maybe not worth keeping,"Although (or perhaps because) I had not read many techno-thrillers, I enjoyed Nimitz Class enough to get its sequel as well. In this type of book, I do not demand profound characterizations or memorable dialogue; although of course they would be good to have, and that the second book shows little improvement here is disappointing, because I rather want Robinson to be a worthy novelist.It is more disturbing to find that he has also failed with some of the technical details which relatively naive readers like me depend upon the author to present authoritatively. Even I was left wondering whether a nuclear lab thousands of miles from its home country could be built and sustained (including transport of personnel and all food and other supplies) only by a couple of small submarines shuttling back and forth. Didn't this strike anyone else as implausible?"
2,"Passable, if you fancy the ""USA uber alles"" view of things.","Let me get it off my chest. It has been two weeks now that I finished reading ""Kilo class"". Oddly for such a book, it took me more than ten days to finish, compared to the usual 2-2.5 days. I felt again and again the urge to put it down. Ficton is supposed to provide a means of communication between men, across the barriers of space and time. Well, the man on the other end was little short of a US version of Adolf. A bigotry feast that I have found difficult to swallow, no matter how fascinating the technology description may have been. I suppose - or should I say afraid - that it may prove to be more acceptable to the US public. At least the author spared us from the cliche of the loner that saves the day, gets the recognition he deserves, and gets the girl at the same time. Passable, if you fancy the ""USA uber alles"" view of things. No ""Hunt"" though. I have found ""Nimitz Class"" to be more interesting and far less irritating."
1,Save uyour time & money,Reviewers compare Robinson to Clancy...Not even close....Clancy doesn't portray the US military as foul mouth arrogant murderers. It is evident that Robinson has an underlying animosity towards the brave men and women of the US military. They have shown great restraint in serving their country under extremely frustrating situations. Talk to pilots of the Viet Nam era. No one in the US military would commit the acts described in this book. Our military have been trained in the use of military hardware; we have also been trained as to the limitations of the use of same. The scenario of the SEALS is an insult to these brave men and women. No one is trained to needlessly murder anyone. Quite the contrary. Leadership training has a scenario that discusses the neccessity of killing unarmed civilians and the conclusion is YOU DON'T!!!!! Robinson OWES AN APOLOGY TO THE seals his for portrayal of them as murdering thugs. SFC US Army (RETIRED)
2,Readable but not great from ex Sub Sailor,Interesting story line but not much in action or facts. Patrick spend way too many pages on his personal sailing trip and less than 2 pages on the first double torpedo shot. The interface between China and Russia was too superficial as well. I did finish the book but skipped a lot of the fill. So this guy has specific orders and then throws away a career in the end. While this may be noble it is not the sub skipper that the US really wants.Nope .. not really worth the read.
2,Lots of potential; little punch,"Kilo Class starts off with action and excitment but, in the end, delivers little of either. Biggest let down is the lack of danger the good ole USA heros ever encounger. Kilo Class portrays the US military as untouchable, which leaves no room for suspense once you catch on. Too predictable."
5,A brilliant insight into the american war machine,"Robinson using the in dept knowledge of the falklands battle commander Sandy Woodford writes this stunning novel about the true might if the American war machine.Getting swept along by the titles main character Admiral Morgan and how he is always on a private war footing with every ancient enemy of the USA makes the book all the more convincing.Once you pick up the book you will be unable to put it down due to the stuning realism created by Robinson. You feel that you are truely involved in the inner workings of Americas true military power and what is due to happen to all that oppose them and their might.a truely brilliant book from begining to end,full of suspense, cunning and in some cases utter ruthlessness. I truely recommend this book to all who are intrested in millitary novels not to be missed"
4,Buy New,Two of the CD's were no good but rush was Ok Next time I will buy new so this will not happen again
3,"Good, but drags too much","This is the first time that I have read anything by Robinson, and I was somewhat disapointed. It took a long time for the story to get going, and once it did, it seemed like the Russians never had a chance. Never the less, Robinson delivers the unexpected with his flashy, showy style. Robinson could have easily made the book a hundred pages shorter by eliminating the over-elaborate charachter descriptions, and several useless plot oversights. When this book is good, its good. Nevermind the complaints about the accuracy of the history, only people with far too much free time on thier hands will notice or care. Overall, the book is good, but could be better."
3,"Exciting plot, yet not too well-written and realistic","Overall, the book is an interesting read because the plot is well laid out and exciting; however, as someone with a profound interest in Asian politics the plot is really quite unrealistic. In addition, the literary style is a litte weak; certain words and phrases are repeated more than twenty times in the book. Again, not a bad bedside reading material."
2,"Enjoyable, if you skip large sections of the story.","The cover denotes him as the next Tom Clancy. In my opinion, Tom need not worry. This book has a wonderful storyline that could be developed. However, we are forced to read excruciating details about the commander's wife (who is only a secondary character) and a North Pole undersea crossing. Mr. Robinson then only devotes a couple of pages to hunting down and destroying two Soviet-built submarines. The book is full of finite details of things which do not move the story along and comes up short on the areas which are exciting and relevant. Finally, the plot is very contrived and the story seems to revolve around luck (like being in a sailboat in an antartic region and seeing a submarine periscope where nothing exists and nobody ever goes but our heros happen to depart their path to Australia and end up here). These sort of happenings are not realistic but seem to be the only way Patrick Robinson could move his story along."
1,A reader came from Taiwan,"I managed to read about 400+ pages before I decided that it's a waste of my time. That is, if I'm a 12-year-old I'd certainly be excited to read a story about a single US nuclear submarine going around the globe against the whole third-world navy and beat them hands down on every aspect. And despite the title of the book, the only length description on KILO class subs (at least until chapter 13) are how they sunk into the river.It's still a long way from ""The hunt for Red October""."
1,Junk,"This book is long, complicated, confusing and borin. The writing style is simplistic and would make a good kindergaren reader. I strongly recommend you avoid it."
4,French reader giving his opinion,"I haven't finished reading the book (in English) and I already think it's a very interesting book, the plot seems plausible to me but I didn't know admirals sweared that much (I don't have any problems with it but is it realistic?)"
3,My first read by Patrick Robinson but more to come.,I was impressed by Kilo Class as my first military based book. The story line was totally believeable and problably has already occured in the world without public knowledge. The cast of characters is many but a list at the beginning of the book kept me on track.
4,Wonderful!! Absolutely Wonderful!! A must read book!!!!!!!,"This book was great. I read it on a long plane trip and we had arrived before I knew it. I can't wait until I read H.M.S. Unseen. I also read Nimitz Class, which didn't have as many submarines and adventures in it as there were in Kilo Class. Again a must read book!!!!"
1,Kilo Class,"Granted, this novel is well researched in regards to the techinical aspects of US and Russian Submarines. What makes me upset is the utter lack of depth and knowledge in the characters, particularly the Chinese. The author continually has the Chinese referring to ""honor"" such as ""It would do me no honor to remind you..."" etc... To my knowledge, the Chinese do not have as high a concept of honor as the author might think, and it is certainly not used every other sentence in conversation. Such stereotypical association leads me to believe that the author is writing some sort of cheap sci-fi novel with extremely archaic Japanese characters."
2,An overly-heralded disappointment,"I disagree with the Florida-Times Union. The book is NOT ""superb,"" and Tom Clancy is far and away a better story teller. Unless you are a devout submarine buff, any Clancy book is better than this one.There are three sequences that may genuinely hold your interest in this story - the mysterious destruction of a science research vessel in Antartica, and a Navy Seal Team assault on some subs in transit. The third likeable scenario is the US sub's hunting of a couple Kilo subs, but you have to wade through 350+ pages to get to it.The characters in this story are cliche and shallow, and the basic premise is not credible. The US risks nuclear war to destroy a few diesel submarines purchased by China? Yeah, RIGHT! We've already let Iran procure a few such subs (in real life). This book is a disappointing treatment of a supposedly ""realistic"" scenario."
3,Not quite there.,"The central idea is interesting, but Robinson's writing doesn't do it justice. Maybe I just wanted the Americans to be heroes. They certainly aren't. At least not in Mr. Robinson's world. They're incompetent thugs. The Russians and the Chinese are pretty clueless too. Maybe Mr. Robinson doesn't think much of sailors. That makes me wonder why he writes books about them."
4,An excellant and believable read!,"Great Tom Clancy-style story. The scenario is pretty believable but its believability could be improved by reading ""Afterword"" at the very end of the book, first. This will in no way diminish the suspense, but will, in fact, aid in the suspension of disbelief. All in all, a terrific read!"
3,Kilo Class,"An intriguing suspense novel about to trigger WW3. Though not as exciting or detail as Tom Clancy's writing,its quite enjoyable about submarine warfare."
4,"Excellent read, but needs to polish up conclusions","Good character development and great underwater battles; didn't drag on the way many other technothrillers do. My only complaint was the conclusion as it was very quick and left some questions (reminance of Grisham?). Aside from that, one of the best techthrillers I've read. Robinson ranks right up there with early Clancy. Really looking forward to #3."
3,"A good read, but some troubling factual errors.","The author does indeed put together a good plot that is somewhat less unbelievable than many others of this genre. It is crammed with facts that the author apparently has spent considerable time gathering. It is also filled with acronyms, some of which are obvious, others not so much so. But when Mr. Robinson mislabels the principal isotope of uranium (U-238) as U-239, and its relative abundance (99.3%) as 90%, one has to wonder how accurate the rest of the ""facts"" are. Nothing about uranium is more fundamental than the atomic mass of the isotopes, and getting pure U-235 would have been relatively easy if, in fact, it had been 10% of the total. But it was good company on two airline flights."
4,Military/Suspense Novel,"If you approach this book as a military/suspense/mystery, you will probably enjoy it more than if you look to compare it to a Clancy novel. If you are looking for a high tech, submarine story you will be disappointed. However, if you take the book at face value and if you enjoy a little suspense and mystery to your military novels, then this book is for you. I would suggest reading Nimitz Class first, as there are several characters that are developed in that book."
2,Almost Accurate,"An intriguing story although full of technical errors and inconsistancies. The ending felt ""Unfinished"" and leaves you hanging. If you are not involved with the US Navy Submarine Community, you will enjoy this Clancy style novel."
1,sick as a dog and stuck with this stinker,"Wish I could stand to watch a little more TV...I'm sick as a dog, and away from home; this ""novel"" is barely a step up from the chocolate bon-bon soap opera crowd's 'entertainment' standards.I'm not as technically-savvy as some of the others who've reviewed this book, but it's plain that the author knows nothing of administrative interactions. He fills out his characters and their habits, but for technical details he's no Tom Clancy. His understanding of Chinese and Russian cultures is stereotypical in the worst way, if not downright ignorant. His writing style is infantile; it's as if he adds detail as he goes because he's just remembered something important--it's like listening to a 6-year old tell you a movie plot.I gave up halfway through the book; god help me, soap operas are more intellectually stimulating...I'm gonna have to try the soaps again."
4,A ripping good yarn!,"This is a globe-trotting thriller starring the USSR's famed Kilo Class submarines & a host of naval brass in the Pentagon & their Black Ops Los Angeles Class skippers. Keen if typical portraits of good & bad guys as well as rousing underwater stalkings & ambushes tell a fascinating tale about Taiwan's not-too-distant future & how the powers that be wrangle for power & stability. Every American is tall & handsome, everyone else is caricatured. The action was hair raising. What I'd call a ripping good yarn!"
5,Great!,"I was reluctant to order such a fragile project, but the thermometer came in perfect condition. The colors are bright, and it's working great so far!"
2,They did not provide almond soap and apparently this is not news,"Like other reviewers, I ordered the almond soap and got something else instead. It is a nasty smelling thing; maybe roses or something else strongly perfumed. I liked the almond soap I was replacing, but do not like this stuff.It lathers up the same, gets the job done. But I don't feel like a man shaving with pink soap that smells like perfume."
2,Mislabeled package,"I am generally please with the Geo. F. Trumper hard shaving soaps. However, when I ordered the almond scented soap, the package labeled ""almond"" actually contained a rose scented soap instead. I had the identical problem with ""almond"" soap purchased in a local pharmacy. The problem appears to be a mistake in packaging from the source."
5,My favorites,I've had these for months and they are by far my favorite winter boots. Totally comfortable and the rigth height to wear with everything. Should have bought ten pairs.
2,"Stylish, but not very comfortable for me","I have some foot problems. I live in the city and walk long distances in my commute and usually love Clarks boots for their style and comfort. But this pair wasn't for me. The leather is stiffer and less giving (and not just because they're new -- other Clarks boots I have weren't like this). The toes of these boots curve up and off the ground and after about a mile of walking in these, my feet were in a lot of pain. They are very stylish-looking boots, but they definitely are not the most comfortable."
5,Very nice boots,"These boots are very comfortable. They run just slightly smaller than usual. I ordered a size 8, which is the size I usually wear and am able to wear them but with a thinner sock. The right boot seems a little tighter than the left (but I think my right foot is a litter bigger than my left). It's just seems a little more noticeable with these boots. A nice heel hight for me (not to high). You can wear them comfortable all day. I wear them to work and out shopping."
3,Follow-the-line Quilting Designs: Full-size Patterns for Block & Borders,"I ordered this to improve my Line Drawing Stash for Long Arm Quilting. I think that there are many uses for them, but haven't had an occasion to use them yet. I'm still a newbie to Long Arm work and expect to be using them soon."
5,Great Patterns,"A great, easy to read and understand resource. Lots of easy to follow patterns with good, clear explanations on how to adapt them for projects. A good way to begin to quilt."
3,A Nice Selection of Patterns,"I recently bought a long-arm so of course I ""needed"" more patterns. I bought her first and second book/box of patterns, and friends bought me this 3rd set. The border patterns work well as pantographs on the long-arm and there are matching ""block"" and ""triangle"" motifs for each design. Each one has a nice variety of patterns - curvey, geometric, for kids, floral, etc... This 3rd set is definetly more challenging than the previous sets."
1,mis-info,"The Volume 2 is shown, but it is volume 3 when you ""look inside."" I can't order without knowing which one I would receive."
5,machine quilting pantographs,"Just what is needed for those who need help with what to quilt and do not want to stiple again. Includes borders, blocks and corners for more than a dozen patterns. Something for every quilt type."
4,Quilting confidence,"Follow-the-line-quilting Designs Volume Two: Full-size Patterns for Blocks And Borders is a quick way to get started on your quilting. The full-sized pattern allows you to ""try it out"" by laying it on your quilt for fit, but it also can be ""resized"" (by eye or copier) to fit your space. I found her diagrams with numbers to be extremely helpful. Once I finger-traced a few times, I was all set. Clipping the template where I could see it allowed me to visually track. (I do free motion quilting and use her patterns as a starting point.) I especially liked her block and corner motifs which accompany each border. Finally, by meandering her border designs, you can create an ""all-over"" design. This is a great resource. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish the box were a bit larger, as once the templates are unfolded, they do not fit back into the box."
3,"Good intro, but not enough to teach you Oracle","I bought this book to get some info on Oracle 9i to see how it was structured. It was good for explaining the terminology and showed some screenshots. But this book will not get you started using Oracle9i, it onlyhelps you to understand some of the syntax.If you have a strong knowledge of SQL, then find another book, this book covers alot of java and xml explaination when dealing with 9i.In short, if you are curious about using Oracle 9i, this book deliversbut if you want to learn the software, get another book."
3,Noted for Brevity,"The book is well written and easy to read, but it fell way short of my expectations because of its brevity. You really have to consider who this book is intended for before purchasing it. I expected it to be a summary of the most important operating aspects and gotchas with Oracle. Instead, the beef inside the bun amounted to about 100 pages that started off with a description of SELECT statements. This was way too basic for what I needed. For someone who just wants an overview of Oracle, then thisbook would probably suffice. But if you want an overview because you want to learn how to use Oracle, then chances are you're going to want much more than what this book offers. I purchased this book because it was not the behemeth volume so many authors like to produce. I give this author credit for creating something digestible. For me, however, this was just an appetizer that I had to send back to the kitchen for something heartier."
2,The Interpretation of Dreams?,"Sokolov can boast of an extraordinary technique but his playing is affected and pornographic. When confronted with the absurd opening of the second sonata I shrieked with laughter, whilst the slower etudes were grotesquely self-indulgent and over erotic. Just tuck up with a few back copies of Playboy - also, ignore the abysmal program notes on the back of the cd, since they're almost as disastrous as the playing. Enjoy."
2,Are they really the Four Freshmen?,"AS a Four Freshmen fan this CD was really a disappointment. The arrangements are right, but the voices are weak, do not blend well and are a sad imitation of the fabulous earlier group. One should watch dates when ordering Four Freshmen CDs."
5,"Excellent yes, but overpriced beyond $8.50 USD","This is an excellent reference book, but as of May 31, 2011 this book was available from the publisher, Albatros Productions Ltd. for 5.0 British Pounds or about $8.50 US."
2,Her other Thai book is much better,"This book is basically a duplication (with much better photos) of her earlier book ""Real Thai"". Except that ""Real Thai"" has a few more recipes like fresh limeaid. If you already have ""Real Thai"" there is no reason to buy this book unless you want a few glossy pictures."
4,70 Nice & Easy Thai Recipes...,"I love to eat Thai food. I am a good cook, but not a great one by any means, so wanted to have a Thai Cookbook that offered quick, easy & delicious recipes to follow for my busy lifestyle. This one definitely fits the bill!I have yet to try all the recipes in this book, but the few I have tried have been delicious and have been thoroughly enjoyed. Especially the curry dishes, which are fabulous!I like the layout of this book and the one or two paragraph introduction written by the author before each recipe. The ""Useful Utensils For Cooking Thai Food"" section at the end of the book is also good!"
5,Great recipes & hints on how to cook Thai food,"The recipes are easy to follow, as long as all the ingredients are prepared first. I prefer hotter food so have extra jalapenos on hand. The information on utensils, techniques, and spices, etc. is extremely useful."
5,"A very user friendly cookbook, and fun to read too!","I am so glad I bought this book. I have cooked many of the recipes already. I really appreciate having the information on what unusual ingredients are and where to purchase them--or how to substitute with other, more common items. I have learned though, that it doesn't take very much curry paste to make a dish good and spicy! From experience I've learned that I prefer to only use about half of what the recipe calls for--and it is still plenty spicy! I would recommend this cookbook to anyone who would like to get started with some Thai cooking! Yum!"
4,An ethnic cookbook actually worth the price!,"I usually feel lucky if I find one or two recipes in a cookbook that I really enjoy. So far, I've tried 3 recipes from this book and 2 were excellent, plus there are many others I can't wait to try. Nothing is particularly ""quick"" for me in the kitchen, but these recipes are actually pretty easy. I wish McDermott had included more vegetarian recipes or suggested ways to make more of the recipes sans meat, but overall I am really glad I chose this book!"
5,"Tasty, easy Thai food at home","I purchased this book in order to make the shrimp curry with pineapple which my wife loves. Although I'm sure it's not the most authentic Thai book out there, the recipes are simple and easy to make and taste enough like the real thing for me. So far we've made the above curry, Spicy Basil Stir-Fry, grilled flank steak with Crying Tiger sauce as well as a few of the noodle dishes. All were great and very quick. An added plus; most of the dishes are quite healthy or can be with a few quick changes. I use light coconut sauce to help lower the calorie content. The recipes are really quick too - once you've chopped the food the cooking times are very short. The book has many great pictures too."
2,style over substance,"This is the last time I buy a cookbook without cracking it open first. It was a real disappointment. This book is for beginners only. The dishes are easy, but not necessarily tasty or authentic. One recipe has fish sauce as its only seasoning, and I could figure that out myself. I found 2 recipes that used canned tuna - yuck!There is a distinct lack of quality control as well. I tried to make one of the curries but the recipe called for so much liquid, it would have been soup if I didn't modify it drastically. The book is designed awkwardly so it won't stay open by itself, a real pain when you are cooking. I only gave 2 stars because the pictures are lovely."
4,Good book -,"This is a decent book - easy to follow recipes and they actually tasted authentic - you can tell, the author has spent a lot of time putting some thought into each recipe and trying to make it as easy as possible - now finding some of the items in a small NC town is a difficult task. McDermott does give suggestions and this really helps."
1,"Maybe Quick and Easy, but not Tasty","Since Paht Thai has always been one of my favorite dishes, I thought I'd start off with that one. Talk about Blah. Based on that, I'm not sure that I'd try another one."
3,ITS OK,"IT CAME OUT A LITTLE DULL FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I PAID, WISH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BRIGHTER SO THAT IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED BETTER."
2,Stay away if using this cable in your car.,I bought this cable to use in a 2010 chevy tahoe. When connected to the facotry radio I got a lot of buzzing and humming. Decided to return this item for an auxilary cable with a noise reduction box. Haven't received the new cable yet but i will try to update this review when i do.
4,Works with the iPhone 4G but not the 3GS,"With regards to this being a quality Belkin cable...I have no idea. But what i do know is that it works great (for now) with the iPhone 4G in the Otterbox case. It's a snug fit but it will plug in without the need to undo the top clip.Since it was working so good for me I bought one for my brother who has a 3GS. Unfortunately the jack doesn't fit right with the phone (not a fault of the case, plugged it in without the case). The problem is that only one of the signals comes through, so you only get half of the sound, think it has something to with the plug not being long enough.When I bought it, it was $3.00, for that I'd say it's great value, just know that it doesn't work with older iPhone's."
4,"Works just fine, great price.","I've had these for a few weeks and they work just fine. No frills, but they were a great price and do the job."
1,They send a mono cable,"In the picture the cable looks stereo, however what they send is a mono cable. Of course this is not what I wanted and in songs that are full stereo like the beatles from the 60s the quality of sound is not as expected"
3,It's an 8th in cable alright...,"What can I say, it's a basic audio cable. For the price, you can't go wrong. No issues with this cable. I would buy more if I could combine the shipping."
4,"Yep, it is a cable","I purchased 2 of these cables for myself and my roommate to use in our cars. We both have AUX input jacks on our stereo and wanted one of these cables for a variety of devices. It works perfectly with her Ipod Classic, and my Sansa Fuse, however when we hook up a Droid phone to stream Pandora we get crackling and noise on the speaker any time the cord moves. If you are hooking up an MP3 player and want more than 1ft of cord this is a good buy. *Note both cars are a different make model and stereo brand*"
1,Erick,Unfortunately I Received the wrong item. I don't care about return it though it was cheap and I could use it later on in life.
1,Limited use only,"I use this for my iPod in my car. After 4 months of near daily use, it is cutting out the right channel very consistently; I have to jiggle it to get it working correctly. Total pain when you're driving. Although, it started cutting out about two months ago, I've just been putting up with it since then. I will be ordering a more expensive one ($8Mediabridge - 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable - (4 Feet) [New design accomodates iphone, itouch, smartphone and mp3 cases]) in hopes it will last longer."
1,Horrible!,"Minimal sound output through cable, but maximum static. Actually blew a tweeter just by connecting the cable. Trashing this junk! What a waste!"
4,This is a cable.,"Really isn't much to say about the thing. It feels pretty durable and sounds good. The only thing you might want to look out for is the casing around the end of the plug. I got this for an ipod/car hookup and the cable won't connect completely because of the case on my ipod. Simple enough to fix by taking off the case, but some people might find it annoying. If that isn't problematic for your setup then this product works fine."
2,Lasted almost a year,"Most of the audio extension cables Amazon sells have terrible reviews. I don't remember what this one has since it's been a year since I got it. It worked fine for a while - almost a whole year of normal indoor use - and last week it finally crapped out. So if you only need a cable for one year... or less, if other reviews are to be believed... then I guess this is fine?"
1,"Good Seller, terrible product (Not sellers fault)","I received the product in perfect conditions, at the right time and in the correct package (100% to the seller) but the product is useless! sound qualitu is terrible!"
3,Works but not perfectly.,"I bought two of these cords one for my car and another for my fiancee. I plugged mine in and it worked right away, but whenever we plugged hers in it was not playing because there was a short in the wire.Once we wiggled the cord around a little bit it began to play. After a week of use in my car in 30 degree weather my cord also began to cut out, needing to be wiggled in order to play properly.Although it sometimes cuts out it has not completely died after three months of use. If it dies or anything changes I will update this review! I am sure this would be a better cord for the summer rather then the winter."
4,mini stereo adapter,"I use this to connect my MP3 player to modern AV equipment (TVs, stereos, etc.). works well and is just long enough."
2,I'm not so sure...,"I am no expert, but I don't think that this is a Belkin brand aux. cord. It came in a sealed plastic bag with a white sticker and it is not marked with a Belkin label. Also, it seems to be below-average quality. I would look elsewhere."
1,My god,"I got a defect. I didn't get why such a simple cord can be a defect, but I learned the lesson. Anyway, the good news is I got my full refund. Good luck to you guys!"
1,Poorly Made!!,"This product absolutely sucks. I plugged it in and it crackled with every single movement you make. The build of the wire looks really heavy duty and sturdy, but moving the cord or spinning the plug it crackles like a cheap Chinese made plug that you would find on eBay. DO NOT BUY"
1,Terrible Product - Broke within 1st HOUR,I really wish I went with the $3 more expensive gold plated cord. This one is terrible. From my computer to my sound system it literally broke within 1 hour.It's making the loud hissing noise and it's truly worth nothing now.DON'T buy this cable.
1,3 movies for 6 bucks...there's gotta be a catch...,"Yes there's a catch. The catch is that the films are almost unwatchable to do the horrendous picture quality, and I'm not talking about graininess or other minor complaints. The picture quality is so blurry it hurts your eyes to watch. I usually am not a stickler for picture quality, but when its this bad I feel cheated. Black Cobra 3 even has a black bar like widescreen movies at the top of the screen, but not at the bottom. The picture also shakes throughout all three films. The quality of all three film was so bad that I couldn't even finish watching them. What a shame because they were enjoyable B-grade action entertainment. Maybe someday they will release these films in a more acceptable form. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
5,Great Ambient feel uncovered,"DJ Micro brings a great feal to the ambient house collection of music. He is a great influense on me and my own music. Overall, these tracks keep a strong since of tallent alive and I think Micro's music is absolutely incredible. If I could promote this CD, more, I would. All I can say is I hope he's up in Seattle sometime."
3,Where is Micro ?,"This cd is not a djmixed album but a so-so trance compilation. People who liked micro`s techmix series, won't like this one. His breaky epic sound made him one of my favourite djs. But this cd has nothing related with micro. I don't see anything particular with mixing or the set.2 stars for tracks. And 1 star for the respect of Micro. (First time listeners: go get tech-mix2000)"
2,MAINSTREAM MICRO AT IT AGAIN,"This guy use to be a phenominal DJ, but now all he is doing is playing live the same tracks that is on his CD's. He should be playing underground music that is almost impossible to find to show what he can do, but if you go to see Micro, you may as well not expect anything good out of the guy. All he does is promote his CD's like he's a stupid rock band. With the skill he could have, he should be promoting himself as an excellent DJ, not as a guy who puts out a mainstream trance disc every two months. Add this CD to your mainstream wanna be raver trance collection"
4,its a great buy,if u are a person who love photography this iss great. u can hav it on ur computer to take pics or short video.and u can also take it outside and do the same
2,The Wayfarers,"Definitely too slow! Truthfully, did not finish this book because it never caught my interest. A little surprising, because Mary Stewart is one of my favorite authors!"
1,The Wayfarers,"Very old style of book, not to my taste. The heroine was much too passive for me. I prefer a heroine with a bit of gumption."
3,the wayfarer,written in true Mary Stewart fashion. Not bad reading. Did not possess the the mystery quality that I thought it might contain.
1,Carmen,I still have not received the version of Carmen that was stated in the description. I've received the French version the first time and returned it for the English version after speaking with customer service. Now I've received the French version again. I'm tired of returning it to the post office for return shipping. I give up.
4,another solid release for the Legends,"IMO, Scarub has always been the most underrated after Bicasso. This album shows what Scarub can do lyrically. He also has a really tight flow that helps keep you interested. Prodcution wise, not as good as Heavenbound but def. an album any Legends fan can get into."
5,3MG's SCARUB..........,"THE MELACHOLY GYPSY's scarub is one of the under ground west coasts best mc's, along side of MURS, GROUCH, ELIGH, mystic journymen etc........if you are into good abstract underground west coast hip hop go and buy this cd, cause sooner or later its going ta be to late.......trust me, seen it happen lots!! and the fact that this cd is one of scarubs oldest(i think his first) ne ways if you are into the ^^^^^^ above hip hop that i mentioned or are a open minded hip hop listener go and purchase this cd.....you wont go wrong, scarub is a lyrical genious who should not be slept on!!!!!!!"
4,A little difficult to install and I am still not sure it works right,"This was a do-it-yourself project that I thought I would take on to save a few bucks. I could have had a professional install, including the price of a similar unit, for about twice the price but I thought, what the heck, I can at least save some money and it doesn't look too hard to install. Well it turns out it was a little more difficult than I anticipated. Getting to some areas and getting the ground screw in was a little tight (and the unit simply didn't work well without a proper ground). It still isn't working 100% but I can't be sure it is the unit (although all indications is that it is). If I had it to do over again I would have got it professionally installed."
1,"cute idea, but doesn't work","I thought this would be cute, but it was irritating to read and pretty shallow. SM is a bad choice, normal dull things turn out good. A disappointment."
1,Unpleasant,"It's a bit difficult to describe how unpleasant this book is - it's choppy and hard to follow, rather than cute, and mostly the multiple ""adventures"" are irritating. The writing is slap-dash, moralistic, and shallow, and the characters are like a cheap rewrite of Maupin with sexual acts thrown in. Not recommended."
2,The Achilles Heel.,In theory it is a great unit but where the door attaches it is not very robust. After a couple of years the plastic dries out and becomes brittle and breaks. I did a temp fix where the latch goes but then the hinge on the door rotted shortly after and there is no way to keep the door from flying off when you rotate.
3,Difficult to turn,This is a perfectly functional composter. My only problem with the unit is that after you fill it about half-full it becomes nearly impossible to turn without two burly guys to help you; The base is not easy to roll the unit on.
4,good product,This is a very efficient composter at a great price - lots better than the boxy one I had a few years ago which fell apart never to be together again.
2,Value,"Not worth cost. It is just a plastic drum, you can make one for a lot less that would produce the same compost. I would not recommend purchasing."
4,Envirocycle Composter,"Envirocycle Composter works well - easy to set up and use and, especially with a compost accelerator, quick to produce usable compost. Ordering and delivery were problem free."
3,FRUIT FLIES,"Too early to tell yet, about another month before i turn out a batch. BUT !!!SWARMS OF FRUIT FLIES EVERY TIME I ADD MORE STUFF !!!ANY SUGGESTIONS ???"
3,"They work, but they're ""too much""","Similar to the Preggie Pop Drops, these things DO work to help with morning sickness. They're a bit ""big"" on the dose/size of the lollipop. Really--when you're dealing with morning sickness there is only so much ""sweet"" you can take.I seriously recommended breaking the pops and using them as ""drops"". :)"
2,Pin Seeker,This book is a collection of short stories. Many of them I found myself forcing myself to read completely. Others I found so disinteresting that I skipped to the end. Fortunately I didn't spend much on this book.
2,Doesn't hold CD covers well.,"I thought this case was priced well for its sturdy materials, metal edges, handle, and lock and was quick to buy it. But when I got home and attempted to load my CDs and CD Booklets into it, I noticed that the booklets won't fit into the inner CD slots because the slots angle in such a way as to avoid the 3-ring binder poles. I was disappointed by this and returned it."
1,The lock jams.,"I had problems from the first month with the lock. It would jam, and ultimately would not open with the combination (no, I did NOT forget the combination). It'd ""click"" like it was going to open, then jam up.Eventually, I had to get a hammer and bust it open to retrieve the CD's.The product itself is constructed poorly. The seller, though, was fine-- shipped the product very quicly."
1,Hate it!,This Vaultz product was incredibly disappointing for me. I have used the smaller versions offered by this company and was satisified. The 200 count CD case was a nightmare from the very start. The pages would not flip without hanging on to the binder rings. I lost 13 CD's as a result of this poorly constructed product. The CD's were cracked when I opened the case due to shoddy design.
2,Another with bad locks,The latches and locks are a pain. They dont work right and cause personal distress. Would look good but the latches put a damper on this product and others that come in the same day dont look as good.
5,Media Binder,"Great product! Strong, well made, and a secure environment for your CD collection or back up media for your PC."
5,This thing is huge!,This is a great case for CDs or DVDs. Very durable and I like that it isn't floppy like all the other kinds of disk folios. It also has a front pocket and a Velcro strap in the back so that when you close it the pages don't fall all over each other.
2,vaultz...locked out,great looks and feel! the only drawback of this case is its cheap locking mechanism. i was locked out of my case within one week of buying it brand new. The lock would not open at all and seemed to be jammed. The mechanisms looked and felt cheap from the begining. Now i am left with an expensive cd wallet that does not lock. I should have read the reviews befor ordering.i hope this helps .
3,Vaultz Locking Media Binder VZ01076,"I like my binder, but it has its drawbacks. I was looking for the case with the center spine that totally lays flat. Because the center spine does not lie flat your dvd's buckle as you fill the case. You have to be careful not to damage the contents. The weight is another issue for me. I was suprise by how heavy 200 dvd's would be. Because the case is so heavy, the use of the strap is almost impossible. If the strap was thicker & wider like a computer case strap for example, it would be 100% better. That way it wouldn't cut into your shoulder. Overall, it's a nice product."
2,good but with faulty locks,"This media binder is large and has room to add more pages. It feels sturdy and secure, and looks really professional. This is a good price as well, because Hastings is selling it for way more. However, the mechanism for the locks broke or something because when I went to unlock it a couple days after I bought it, nothing. I had to pry it open with a screwdriver. The vaultz people were really helpful and sent a replacement. This would be perfect if not for this locking failure, because the case is so nice and holds notebooks and lots of other stuff as well. I'd pay more $$ for working locks!"
2,Disappointed with the style,"I was disappointed with the style of the item that I received. Vaultz has changed the design of this item. I was looking for the old design, which had a separate bottom piece with 2 hinges (one on each side of the bottom piece), that allowed the binder to open up completely & D rings that make it easier to access all the pages in it. This was what was pictured. What I received however, was the new design that has just 2 sections, 1 hinge & U rings, that, in combination, make it difficult to access the pages in the back. I was very disappointed with the misleading pictures on the site."
1,Classic case of bait and switch!,"This case is not the one that was pictured when I purchased it! It claims to holdtwo hundred dvd's and that is true if you only want to be able to reach about onethird of them, any more than that you have to take the top twelve sheets out toget to the one's on the bottom. Very disappointed with Amazon for even pulling astunt like this. Now I realize why they waited more than an entire month to ask me to review this product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CASE, SAVE YOUR MONEY."
3,Matter of Personal Preference,"I own two of these binders as well as three of the two drawer cabinets. I love Vaultz but only gave it three stars because:1. Faulty lock on first one I bought, had to exchange it2. Pages don't turn freely.3. The interior pockets don't hold dvd inserts securely, they are prone to sliding out when openening the binder.4. More difficult to keep items alphabetized without wasting pages.5. Difficult to label media without titles on them or double sided discs.If you are constantly on the go with CDs and DVDs this might be right for you. I have found that it is easier to maintain my collections of CDs, DVDs and software by using the file drawers with cd sleeves. I currently useone binder for all things Star Trek and the other for all things Stargate. I found the binders a superior choice for housing TV series with many seasons, movies and spinoff series."
3,Worth a try.,"My cat watched this video and was fascinated for the first 15 minutes. Then she was done with it. I put the video on again for her the next day and she wasn't interested in it. She did look up at the TV when whale sounds came on and she seemed to like the water noises.The DVD has an option to play the video with nature sounds and with music. The music is new age, calming music, and one of the songs is an ""asian"" inspired song. The nature sounds don't match the video, but who cares? If your cat likes it, then that is all that matters. The video is 60 minutes, but runs continuously. Which is great if you want to leave it on while you are not home.If my cat watched this DVD the whole way through or was interested after the first try I would give it five stars."
2,Boo Hiss,"This DVD was a total waste of my money. My cats weren't the least bit interested and the sounds didn't always match the picture on the screen which is confusing to them...they can see a bird, but it's jingling like a cat toy....what's up with that? Fish that sound like crows?? Some of the videotaping was also very shoddy. The only reason it got any stars at all was because of the pretty cats that were used in making this and they do tug at your heartstrings."
3,not what I expected,"the video is not what I expected, my cat was not interested at all. I have left the video on for hours"
2,Obnoxious and unappealing to the cat,"The auditory component does not match the visual display. The cat had nothing to do with this annoyance, but it is what it says at a minimum."
4,Excellent entertainment for cats,Input this video on my iPad and sit it on the floor to entertain my cat. He loves to sit and watch it. He tries to figure out where the birds and fish are and follows the ball and shapes around. Good purchase.
1,I don't think so...,"My cat sometimes watches T.V. and I thought that this would be an awesome idea. People were saying that their cats went up to the t.v., but my kitty looked for less than a second and went about her business. She watched it LESS than she does normal t.v.! I will admit that it is soothing, but it is not meant for cats to be entertained."
4,Lucky likes it!,"My cat, Lucky, enjoys the video. I would suggest it for kitties that already show an interest in the television. If the bird segments were longer, it would hold his attention better...he seems to be fond of things that display short, jerky movements (about 1/3 of the video contains that). There's a variety of things for cats to watch from animals and fish to balls on a string. I have to agree with the other review regarding the bizarre animal sounds that have been paired up with different critters on the screen...Lucky wouldn't know the difference though! For the money, it's a fun buy."
3,tv for cats!,"My cat was very interested in this DVD. She was fascinated, watching the birds hop around the screen and even tried to grab one bird on the screen! My only complaint was that it might have been nice to match the sounds with the scenes on this DVD (whoever created it has bird sounds when there are fish on the screen, fish sounds when there are birds, etc.) But my cat didn't seem to care. If you want some fun entertainment for your cat, and for you, I recommend this DVD. Of course, it depends on the cat. I sent this as a gift to my sister as well and her cat wasn't very excited about it. My cat and I found it very entertaining (and parts of it were soothing to watch too)."
2,Not well thought out,"I purchased this because this content was streamed and I didn't want to fuss with another dvd, much less a cat dvd. I notices my cats watching parts of cartoons, mostly chase scenes, and sections of videos showing birds taking flight or in a group feeding, and they were fascinated with long shots of birds at a feeder or taking to flight and one object chasing another. This dvd had none of that. There were some bird shots, but there was a lot of editing between shots and close ups--which didn't gets my cats' attention at all--no interest in pictures of birds. I didn't see any interest and didn't expect a cat to be interested in pictures of other cats doing anything, likewise the shots of cat toys fell flat."
5,HP paper.,"I love the paper, great quality and have had no jamming problems or odd problems.I will buy this paper again.Great bargain as well."
4,"Not the Best, But An Acceptable Alternative","I've used this copy/print paper for years and recommend it for general use in inkjet printers and copy machines. Each ream is 500 pagers. The pages are bright white, so colors stand out clearly. I've used this paper to make greeting cards, and the final print is very pleasing to view. In terms of functionality, I find the paper goes through the printer smoothly, does not stick together, and offers clear economical printing for the home office. There are cheaper ""copy"" papers, but I have found these tend to jam up in the printer. Rarely will this paper jam in my HP printer, and rarely will the printer draw two sheets (rather than one).I like this paper, but I do not purchase it here, as it is too expensive. I can generally get this paper from Wal-Mart at around $3.25 - $3.50 a ream.konedog"
5,Paper,"It's printer paper - nothing more nothing less. You can print notes for class on it, or even some paperwork before you go to the DMV! Either way, it's the cheapest paper I could find on Amazon, and it works as well as anything else."
3,paper,As far as paper goes it is ok. THe price was a little steep but it met my expectations. I'm not sure I would order it again but if I need paper I probably would. Love my HP printer so I try to keep with the same stuff.
2,A Sam's Club product,"My family does not shop at Walmart or Sam's Club due to their business practices related to employees. Not a mention in the product description that this ships from Sam's Club. Very misleading to the customers like me. I'm sure the paper is fine, but I don't like being lead to believe I'm buying from a 'little guy' only to find out I've given money to a big conglomerate that refuses to pay employees a living wage (many Walmart employees are on welfare and food stamps)."
5,Good paper for a good price,"I've been writing on this paper with pens and feeding it into my black and white laser printer for about a year. I've never had a problem with it, and it seems to hold up well over time. Highly recommended."
2,Low quality for the price.,"This paper is sold for the same price on Amazon and local stores (Staples, etc).However, paper quality is really low for its price point.There are much better paper out there at the same price, such as Hammermill."
1,terrible paper!,Cheap and thin! My laser printer curled and wrinkled the paper worse than any other brand I tried. I wish I could throw away the two packs I bought but that woudn't be very eco-friendly of me.
2,Thinnest paper I have ever bought.,"Has a bright white color, which is nice. But this is truly the thinnest paper I have ever bought. It literally feels fragile when you hold it."
5,great quality!,"We use this paper for the office and I usually manage to catch it when it's on sale. Great quality, great value!"
