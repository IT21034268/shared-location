5,Simply the Best!,"I have loved Crochet Today since it's beginning. It has always provided attractive, easy-to-read patterns and I've made many gifts from its pages. I teach crochet and always recommend this magazine for beginners. The instructions in the back are clear and the photography is lovely. The only disappointment was that I'd already purchased the first issue from this subscription. Oh well, it was such a phenomenal offer that it was more than worth it. I am looking forward to enjoying four more issues!"
5,Crochet Today! Is the Best!,"Thoroughly love all of the fun articles,instructions and patterns!In this day of online magazines it is wonderful to see that you can still enjoy a cup of tea while browsingthrough my most loved Crochet Today!"
4,oldie but a goody,"Wanted to get a copy of ""Let's dance"" but did not know the artist. When I found out it was Chris Montez and he was mentored by Richie Valens ( I think)that made my decision to buy."
3,Tight story with a great cast.,"This is a good movie that has a tight story with a great cast. I was shocked by how much I liked this film and was happy to get the chance to see it. It is a film about a kid who is crazy and has no idea what is right or wrong, if he cared any way. The mentally unstable kid Terry Lambert is played by John Savage who many of you have seen in other films like Salvador,The Godfather: Part III, and The Deer Hunter. Terry's mother is played by the great Ann Sothern who pretty much steals the show and is worth seeing this film for alone. Cindy Williams (from Laverne & Shirley) is in here and is so cute as a renter of one of the rooms in mom's big ol house. Things start off pretty bad for our boy Terry Lambert and only go down hill from there. If you like old 70's movies this is for sure worth a look."
3,THE AMAZON REVIEW STATED THAT THIS DVD HAD RUTH ROMAN AND ANN SOTHERN IN IT. GUESS WHAT? NO RUTH ROMAN OR ANN SOTHERN IN THIS,THIS DVD WAS ADVERTISED STARRING RUTH ROMAN AND ANN SOTHERN. GUESS WHAT? NO RUTH ROMAN OR ANN SOTHERN. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS.
5,good beef base,"This stuff is great. Can keep in the pantry for a year or two, so dont worry about buying a large quantity. Rich and flavorful. I gave some to a few friends who also loved it."
1,Am I Missing Something?,"Unless I'm very much mistaken there are a few songs on this collection, most noticeably ""Henry VIII I Am"", that aren't the original versions. Listen for yourself and purchase at your own risk..."
2,Won't play or rip on computer,"Most of the songs have skips, distortions or pieces of other songs when played on disc player! Won't play or rip on any computer tried (3). Sounds flat or not the right artists, he sounds better live today than this does. Don't bother buying it!"
5,Just as wonderful as ever,"The music holds up and gets you dancing around the house,bopping in your car or wherever you may be.I had forgotten how great this album was.Highly recommended."
5,Sometimes.....,"Sometimes it's very enjoyable to listen to pop music that a great many people see as ""light weight"", or ""unsubstantial"". Actually there was more to Herman's Hermits than the single releases would indicate. This Cd, of course, contains the singles and could be written off by ""serious"" rock music fans as ""mindless"" or ""throwaway rubbish"". (I've heard both of those used when describing H. H.) Of course, that's silly. It is a shame that the band itself was rarely used in the studio, but I understand that the guys really could rock in person. They should have fought (as the Monkees did) to play on thier records more often. You would think they eventually had the clout to do so. Anyway, Herman's Hermits was a good band and this is a good Cd of thier greatest hits, and you really shouldn't let other people tell you what to listen to. After all, it's your money and your time being spent."
1,this is FAKE,that is NOT Peter Noone singing all those great hits!Avoid this cd - it's some remake using a picture of Peter to con you!
5,"I love the song Silhouettes, you should make it listenable","I love the song Silhouettes, you should make it listenabl"
4,"Good, but....","You better buy ""The very best of Herman's Hermits"". Why?. Because ""A must to avoid"" is in full stereo (all this recordings are mono). In my opinion ""The very best..."" is a better compilation. Just take a look, and compare. Both CD has original recordings. Be carfull!. The market is full of HH remakes!"
1,album sounds strange to me,"Something is strange in this album and I am not enough of an audiophile to know what it is. My two theoriesThe re-mix was done by someone who never heard the originalsorThis album is the British cuts of the hits, and this sounds strange to my American ears.Every track was a tune that I knew, but for every track I said hummm, this is a version I had not heard before."
1,Their Greatest Hits-Herman's Hermits-(Abkco),"This is the first CD of Herman's Hermits music available in the U.S.A. from one of the truly great groups of the early 60's. It was the first taste of Herman's Hermits on CD for this fanatic fan of Peter ""Herman"" Noone & his chaps!! However, this CD has some real draw backs as Peter Noone & The Hermits are NOT compensated for it's sale. Allen Klein who controls all Herman's Hermits songs in America has NOT paid ANY royalities to Peter & the boys to this day. If that doesn't turn you off, the music's sound will as it's very poorly remastered....Allen, can't you even do a decent job for the fans when you are making all the profits! Fortunately, for fellow fans there are plenty of super imports out there. Check out some of Olaf Owre's reviews."
5,best CD ever made,"i love the song ""henry the 8th, i am"" a lot! it's the best song i've ever heard in my life."
5,Singable Songs For Those Interested in 1960's Music,"I used this CD with my after school class of middle schoolers as they used lyric sheets to sing along while the CD played. They loved it. The songs are singable and gave the students an appreciation of music that was popular before they were born. Some of the students said the music then was better than what is popular now. This CD gets the endorcement of not only me, but 11 to 13 year olds as well. I enjoyed it so much I ordered eight additional copies. If you enjoy music don't deny yourself this CD."
4,Really Good Book,"This is a good book, but has sadness. It is sentimental. The main character's first wife died, and his daughter is back East. I think the ending is sad."
4,The Road To Redemption,"This book is basically about gaining redemption and salvation through the power of love. However, even though this is true it does not have a perfect ending. Overall the story was good but it could have been better. It is a moving story."
3,Though I've read all of his other books...,"I was very disappointed with the latest. It was too predictable and didn't ""tug at my heartstrings"" as the Christmas Box trilogy did. but I have faith, maybe the next will be better."
5,This book touched my heart!,"I read and brought this book a few years ago and I love it now as much as I did back then. It is a very special book that is both spiritual and romantic. It might not have the ending that everyone wanted, but I feel that if the book had ended any other way, it would not have been as good. I cried at the end of the book and once in a while a pick it up and read it again."
5,"Excellent, He has surpassed himself again","This book was one of my most favorite of Richard Paul Evans. I have now read ALL of his books, and enjoyed them all very much. I am so glad that he had this spiritual urge/need to write the first book (The Christmas Box) and of all the good that he has done from that. He continues to be a wonderful author and I am so thankful that he does write and bring such pleasure to all of his readers. However, this book is my most favorite and I've gotten my Mom to read all of them as well. I could not put it down and just read and read (usually through tears). He tells such a wonderful story, and I guess I was naive in wanting a HAPPY ENDING. So did my Mom, but I think it had to end this way because it made a great deal of sense and seemed so much more poignant. Anyone who really enjoys reading should take the time to read this one, as you would most certainly enjoy it."
2,Ordinary,I did not find this work very stirring. The characters lacked depth. The story skimmed over several issues.
2,The Looking Glass,It has been a while since I read this book. I really liked some of his other books but this one just lacked content material.
5,"A period piece, but loads of fun","The Turtles 1965 debut album, full of period charm and youthful verve. ""Happy Together"" is a better album overall, but this has more nostalgiac appeal for fans of the genre and the era."
3,No tracking listing on outside,"I expect a track listing on the back of a CD just as I expected a track listing on the back of a record album cover in the 1960s. There is NO tracking listing exposed for this CD. You have to hunt for it. It is INSIDE the front insert, which is equivalent to putting it on the record sleeve of an LP. There is not one on the back (tray card), nor one on the inside cover of the front insert. This is simply inexcuseable. However, great music!"
5,Excellent Product,Easy to install and set up. Very useful if you alternate between two cars and don't want to buy two receivers. Have seen other receivers and I think the Audiovox reciever and docking bay is the best. Does not need to be hardwired into the car (although it can be) and very user-friendly. I would recommend this brand receiver and docking bay.
3,So So,This book also was somewhat disappointing for its information. Again I will keep it with my genalogy work. I expected more than these 2 books delivered.
2,First-rate treatment of a rather second rate movie...,"I don`t enjoy disagreeing with the other reviewer of this film- he obviously knows what he`s talking about and is genre-knowledgable, but after seeing the supurb ""JIGOKU"" and ""Yotsuya Ghost Story"",I purchased this flick as soon as it was released and couldn`t have been more disappointed -it`s slow moving, none of its characters are fleshed out in any way, the horror element is non-existent and,truth be told, there is no real snake woman in sight- in stark contrast to what the dvd cover would have you believe. Your money and your time would be better spent on his earlier works, or on other Asian Cult Cinema releases like ""Madame O"", ""Blind Woman`s Curse"" or Teruo Ishii`s ""Horror Of Malformed Men"" - all of which are a lot more fun and enjoyable to watch, IMHO."
4,Classic Japanese Thriller,"As a collector of foreign films old and new like Japanese classics: ""Kwaidan"", ""Onibaba"", ""Lady Vampire"", ""Madame O"", ""Slave Widow"", ""Ghost Story Of Yotsuya"", ""Blind Woman's Curse"" starring Meiko Kaji and erotic ones like ""Flower & Snake"" starring Naomi Tani, ""Manji"", ""Gate Of Flesh"" and ""In The Realm Of The Senses"" (the blu-ray by Criterion is fantastic) to the wild Pinky Violence films like ""Sex & Fury"", Meiko Kaji's Sasori series, ""Sukeban"", ""Zero Woman: Red Handcuffs"" and so many more, I am presently pleased with ""Snake Woman's Curse"". The film did have some dread and impending doom elements to it. Definitely a worthy purchase. Synapse is pumping out some good stuff. I made sure I bought Junko Miyazono's ""The Legend Of The Poisonous Seductress Trilogy"", ""Madame 0"", Christina Lindberg's ""Exposed"" and ""Wandering Ginza Butterfly"" 1 and 2 also starring Meiko Kaji."
5,Great Listen,"Saw this in Smithsonian magazine-of course it was much cheaper on Amazon and if you love Irish ballad music, you'll love this CD. It is fun to hear."
4,Irish Pirate cd's,It's ok. Just like most cd's one doesn't like ALL the songs. Some I like and others are so-so.
5,Outstanding Bible,"I own many good Bibles, but this one is in a class by itself. It's directly relevant to day-to-day life. It's outstanding! This Bible deserves more thatn a five-star rating."
5,love the cross reference with the 12 steps,i find the referencing of scripture to the twelve steps very reassuring and encouraging that i'm on the right path. this bible has helped bridge the understanding of family members not familiar with the 12 steps and wondering - what is she up to now?? :o) Great way to learn and incorporate both disciplines
4,Ultra Violet Cam Pants,"First off, I just love Camo so having a womens pair and also in Violet Purple with the pretty greys with that black was really cute. I love all the pockets as well. My girlfriends have commented me while wearing them as well :) The only thing i really wish i could change was that the waist wasnt so high up!- But i just fold them down and wore a lose top.Thank you!"
2,Picture is deceiving - color is not the same,"The picture of these pants shows a lovely shade of purple, in the lilac family. The pants arrived today in a plum color, definite not what we expected. These pants are going back. Didn't even try them on."
4,Fresh young Marianne at her best,"What can I say about Faithful's voice post 60s? She essentially went from one breed of singer (like a Nico, Vasthi, Ross Hannaman or other tonal folksy female singers) to another entirely just by ""trashing"" her voice smoking so much! Not even like Marlene Dietrich or Julie London who started out ""youngish-sounding"" and then the vocal damage added a bit of mystery to their later recordings; Faithful just (to me) sounds horrid trying to re-record anything she did from this era now! I agree that ""Sister Morphine"" would have been better replaced by her version of ""I'm a Loser"" which was still at her peak of youthful vocal quality. Also that this would be better titled as ""Greatest from the 60's"" or ""Early Years"", but one camp likes her later works, etc.. I'm just glad both levels were recorded in her singing career span and those that like each of her efforts can have that available."
3,Pleasant and pretty.,"A compilation of her 1960's recordings, this collection belies the brilliant storm to come. Thirty years ago her voice was a pleasant if limited Mary Hopkinesque instrument, and the folk-pop material included here serves her well. Only Sister Morphine offers any hint of the Dietrich meets Patti Smith material that began to surface ten years later."
4,Accomplished look at modern alienation,"The titular Bartfuss has lived a largely underground existence since surviving the Holocaust, amassing an ever increasing fortune as a smuggler even as his alienation from those around him--particularly his estranged wife and two daughters--continues apace. As a record of a man's journey from a kind of living death, this book benefits a lot from Appelfeld's terse, simple prose, which keeps the tale rolling at a brisk pace. He's the sort of writer who knows exactly what he can state explicitly and what he can leave unsaid. It may just be me, but I was not altogether convinced by the book, partly due to the somewhat abrupt ending. I will tentatively suggest that the author was only partly successful in dramatizing Bartfuss' internal conflicts... or maybe I'm just missing the point of Appelfeld's minimalist artistry. I will still recommend the book, and suggest that who anyone likes it should also seek out Appelfeld's ""Badenheim 1939."""
4,The Wandering Jew,"Appelfeld has written a strange, off-kilter novel with The Immortal Bartfuss. We are treated to the odd life of Bartfuss himself, a ""dealer"" of unknown merchandise, some sort of legend with other dealers, a father to a grown daughter and a younger, mentally retarded daughter. He hardly speaks to his wife and lives in a separate room from her. Bartfuss has money and gold stashed in a secret location, which he reveals to no one.Bartfuss can't let his guard down. He still lives the cagey life of the displaced person, running schemes, trusting no one, living a nomadic, bizarre life. This rootless world is Bartfuss' only legacy. He can no longer settle down as he can die."
3,"Well written, but the author has done better","This is one of the weaker books of Appelfeld in my opinion. It certainly is still an interesting novel, though if you're just getting accustomed to Appelfeld's work, I would recommend Katerina, The Iron Tracks, or Badenheim 1939."
2,Doesn't fit,"States it fits Walther PPK/S handgun but it does not. It won't snap closed over trigger hammer like it's supposed to. If I move the PPK/S as deep into the holster as possible, it causes the slide to move back. It is obvious this holster was made too small. I sent it back and ordered a Desantis Sof-Tuck instead."
4,Interesting Perspectives on Rural Medicine,"I am a student who will likely attend medical school in Fall 2009 for rural medicine. I loved this book, and felt that, while at times a little hard to read (this is no beach reading), it was interesting and thought-provoking. Each story of each physician working with a rural population helped me cement my interest in working with this often overlooked area. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Pennsylvania healthcare, rural healthcare in general, or medicine for underserved populations."
5,Best product ever,It relaxes me right before bed time and make me sleep all night. It is well worth the money that you pay for.
4,Handle easy on the hand,"I originally bought this kitchenaid mezzaluna that came with a hard woven type of plastic (kind that keep tortilla warm) and love it. Trying to buy one now as a wedding gift and can't find the kitchenaid combination knife/bowl anywhere. What I like about this mezzaluna (or ulu) is the handle. Your fingers fit through the loop and it's very easy on the hand, especially when chopping a lot. This is so much faster than a cutting board and chopping nice or the extra mess of a processor. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I dulled a little after about 8 months (I don't use it daily) but still cuts good. Decent price and I like the sheath that covers it for storing. Now if I can just find the set!"
3,Not the sharpest one in the bunch,First let me tell you what I like. The handle! It gives a firm grip without slipping. Excellent control. The cover provides for safe storage. I had have this Mezzaluna for two years now. At first it was sharp not too sharp but able to mince herbs and small veggies. It now has a dull edge. But I am going to seek a professional knife sharpner and bring all my knives. I found another mezzaluna/ ulu that is way sharper and fun to use. It's sharper than the KA was brand new. It's my go to mincer now.Kuhn Rikon Kulu Herb mincer. It's featured on Amazon too.
5,Me encantó,"Margarita Rosa es un disco muy bueno. No se lo puede ubicar en un género definido. Se la puede escuchar muchísimo mejor que en ""Café con aroma de mujer"". Ojalá vuelva a estar en stock. Saludos."
1,The Apocalypse is here.,"I shall sum this album up with this quote from Weekend Update:""HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESUS! I HOPE YOU LIKE CRAP!!!!"""
1,If I want to laugh I'll watch a comedy. if I want to be annoyed and insulted I'll listen to this.,"It amazes me that people are actually giving this album more than 1 star. Come on people, seriously, I don't even want to spend that much time talking about it. William Hung is just so horrible that I'm going to leave it there"
1,Hung is always out-of-season,"Back for yet another album, and this time, a Christmas album, William Hung continues to make the music world appear to be a big, laughable joke.Sure, who hasn't seen that famous clip from Season 3 in 'American Idol' where William butchered Ricky Martin's 'She Bangs'? It's one of the most famous clips in history. And I confess, when I first saw it, I chuckled a bit.But the joke isn't funny anymore. Hung is tone deaf, but you already know that. So why buy his music? He's not funny. And since he's getting signed, as I've stated before, why isn't the tone deaf lady in the shower getting signed? I mean, seriously, folks, this has gone on long enough.Enough with the CDs and stupid inspirational messages, Hung!I can't recommend this to anyone. For the first time in my life, I wish I could give this 0 stars. Please, do yourself (and your ears) a favor and stay far away from this tone deaf kid we call William Hung.Not recommended."
1,Ho Ho Hung (over),"Okay, there is a point to this CD. It's about laughing all the way to the bank, and really, can you blame the guy? He's managed to turn being tuneless, unattractive and generally clueless into a lucrative business. Would anyone buy this album? Sure, why not, if you're looking to torment your friends and family. If it was less expensive, say $3.99, I'd be giving it to half a dozen people on my gift list, just for the pleasure of watching their look of horror upon opening it.Those who are recommending other albums instead of this one are missing the point. There simply is no alternative to this sort of unique item. It's the Chia Pet of music."
1,The anti-terrorism CD,Finally we have a weapon of mass distruction to flush Bid Laden out of his goffer hole. This is a double whammy! First of all it's a CHRISTmass CD and secondly Hungs voice is downright horrible.Here's the plan;1. Send the troops a load of Hungs Christmas CD.2. Infiltrate the Al Jazir airwaves.3. Put ghetto blasters in every hole they can find and blast Hung!Out comes Bin Laden and they nab him!Hung's my new Hero
1,This is a joke,"William Hung is the joke that will not end-it got tiring after the first two tracks from his debut, let alone a sophomore effort. Hung, you had the fifteen minutes you didn't deserve, give it up, us and our eardrums are begging you. The joke has worn far too thin and gone too far-it is no longer funny, it's just annoying. Time to find someone with actual talent, rather than someone who can just make others laugh due to their lack thereof. NEXT!"
4,William Hung ..Ho! Ho! Ho!....this is funny,"Ok i,ll be one of the few of the positive reviews for William.Likewise on his debut album,""Inspiration"".I see all these bad reviews for him and now i believe those people have no sense of humour.Come on,laugh at a little dude that can't sing.Hell im surprised they didn't come out with something like this before.Anyways,Will gets in the holiday spirit with this album.The song selection here is good.But,the songs are short making the whole album very short,18 minutes.One difference is that William actually sounds A BIT better at the singing thing.(I didn't say he was good now folks.)The bonus cut(hidden track) at the end of the album is a version of QUEEN's ""We Are The Champions"".Which is odd for a christmas album.So all you loyal Hung fans enjoy Will's festive spirit here and now,all you un-humourous people....BAH! HUMBUG!"
4,"Come on people, it's a cheap gag gift!","I'm amazed at those who gave it a single star: I'm assuming only those who BOUGHT the album are giving us opinions? Not fair to diss it if you don't buy it or, if you did buy it and it's that bad and ""disappointed"" you, what the heck did you expect?I have friends who ""She Bangs""-ed me to death and now I can pay back for a mere $8? I think that's marvelous. Much better than grandma being run over by a reindeer!"
1,Not Funny,"I find this cd highly offensive, both to my ears and the music world in general. It's not funny and it's not even tasteful. Pardon my language but it just plain sucks. I'm glad Mr. Hung found a way to make some money off stupid americans, but I sure wish he'd do it quieter and that people would stop playing it in public. Crazy Angry Death Music is better any day - and almost more cheery."
1,Enough already there Bill Hung! You (she)banged our ears!,"This tone deaf screeching owl...had his 15 minutes of ill deserved fame - okay, the comedic relief = and he has parlayed bad bar room drunken singing into an actual career! Amazing! Buy this album if to crank it up loud to annoy neighnors, scare mice away or ward off evil spirits. At least that will justify the price of the CD!"
1,Hung High For The Holidays,"I think that William Hung has traveled to new heights with his latest Christmas album. The crowning glory is his cover of ""We are the Champions"" by Queen. This is a must buy for any office yankee swap...just make sure you don't get stuck with it!"
1,Tell me this is just a nightmare...,"One album was bad enough! Did we really deserve to have this steaming pile of cat crap dump another crappy album upon us? Man, I thought his fifteen minutes were up hours ago, but I guess I was wrong."
1,When will this madness end!,"I can't take it anymore! I know that William Hung is going to fizzle out by January 2005, so why prolong the agony that is William Hung! His voice is worse than listening to nails against a chalkboard. I don't know how anyone could buy this CD unless you are truly a ""Hung Fan"" and really think that he's funny.0 out of 10"
2,Why?,"Why is William Hung even releasing a Christmas album? Don't expect some department stores playing this album during the holidays, because it will scare some customers away! Hung's off-key singing is painful and distracting to listen to, and that very uneven Inspiration album is proof. He just doesn't blend with the songs or melodies, coming off disjointed. I think that this trend of bad singers making albums is not a good idea. They need to stop using the bad singer auditions on American Idol as a crutch to sign artists. Get Christmas albums by Vanessa Williams, Kenny G, and some past ones, PROVEN artists that have talent than ilk like William Hung!"
3,Fairly good movie,"The movie was pretty good, but kind of a low budget movie so not too much to expect and the acting was not the greatest either but overall still a good movie."
3,Moving,"This movie was about a woman who lost her husband and was left with nothing. Nothing but a house, A house that already had a family of foster children living in it. The Woman goes from thinking she has lost everything with the death of her husband to finding she has more then she could ever dream of, a family found just waiting for her. Ready to take her in just like they were."
1,"Good message, good values...terrible film","I like to rent Christian films and this one looked pretty good. But I was wrong. I'm sorry but it's really, really awful. The acting is awful, the plot is a little flimsy (how exactly did this wealthy woman end up penniless upon her husband's death & be forced to live with a foster family in a rundown house in the South?). And then there's the random ""elderly"" African American woman, clearly played by someone in her 20s, who appears at times with little bits of wisdom or criticism or I don't know what, but she is totally random, and it's just krazy. I actually fell asleep during this movie. It's just not worth it. Yay for taking in foster kids, yay for Christian films...just not this one."
5,encouragement,"A moving, inspiring, and hopeful movie! Recommend to all teens who think life is tough. There is someone for you who cares about you."
5,The Lost and Found Family,"This is an excellent family movie. It shows the beauty of adapting to change. A rich woman, after the death of her husband, is forced to live in a boarding house with a bunch of mix-matched children, raised by a couple who has no children of their own. Her love and approach not only changed her life but changed each one of them as well. My family and I watched this together and we all cried together and laughed together and had only one regret, there was no sequel."
4,loaded with volcanic artwork,I'm not sure how anyone could label this book as dull....it's chock full of information and it's presented in a highly illustrated way. I recommend this to anyone who has a keen interest in volcanology from the layperson to the geology professor. A book for all.
3,HOW VOLCANISM HAS CHANGED OVER TIME,"This book looks at volcanism and how it has changed over time. It begins with ancient theories about volcanoes and continues to modern times. The last great change in thinking happened in the 18th and 19th centuries when the belief that volcanoes were powered by underground coal fires was disproven. I found this book to be quite informative, although somewhat dull."
3,blast from the past,"Gee, some people seem to have a lot to say about an album that came out 37 years ago. I just bought it because somebody ripped off my album which was pretty well worn out anyway. I missed hearing the classic Hello It's Me. It is a pretty good album, but then I have always liked Todd's music. His ""Todd"" album is what drew me into space music. But this certainly sounds like it was recorded 37 years ago. It's nostalgia. Nothing wrong with that. If you like Todd then you will probably like this one,it is his first attempt. But if you don't like him already this probably won't win you over."
2,"We Came to Hear the Stones, Not the Crowd!","The band is in spirited form, but the screaming audience spoils what could've been a great live album. Actually, 2 of the songs, ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"" and ""Fortune Teller"", are really studio tracks."
1,Unlistenable,"What an oddity--an album of females screaming, with some faint sounds of a band not playing cohesively, in the background. Perhaps the record company had not yet figured out how to produce a live album. Within a few years there would be many classic live rock albums, with compelling musical content,including one by the Stones. This is a time capsule bit of trivia--it is in fact what it was like to see the Stones or other rock and roll groups on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 or 1965. Can you listen to it? Doubtful, although since some people apparently listen to albums of auto race car sounds, there probably are people somewhere who would listen to it."
2,No excuse for this one,"The Rolling Stones/ Got live if you want it!: Even the title seemed to warn us that this might not be what we really wanted. In a few years there would pop up some bootlegs from this period that were better than this. I can only guess that the record company still thought that the `rock n roll craze' was about to fade away and so they wanted to make all the money out of it they could ahead of its demise. Rock did not disappear, but this album should have."
4,"Jeez, people, lighten up!","Maybe this is my punk sensibilities coming through on this but compared to many things out there THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT BAD! Come on people, this was the 1966, you can't expect them to have mastered all the arts and technologies behind recording albums. Either way, it's irrelevant, because this album is one of the most rockin' live albums I've heard in quite some time. Yeah, so they did some overdubs. Yeah, two songs are actually studio tracks. I don't think that diminishes the quality of the album. It's so raw and ready to kick your butt. It showcases the fact that before they became, along with U2, one of the ugly behemouths of concert gluttony, they were real and raw and had Brian Jones rather than Ron (who?) Wood. Sorry, Stones fans, but everything they did after Jones SUCKS save Let It Bleed and Exile on Mainstreet, and this album only reaffirms it."
3,Not Bad,"This is teeny-bopper era Stones, so there is nothing weighty on here. (Blasphemy, but I think the 60's were the Stone worst period). I like the LOVING YOU TOO LONG rendition. As has been pointed out below, some of these songs were recorded in the studio with crowd sounds added. Mick Jagger admitted as much in later years, by saying, ""When we tried to get a whole live show recorded, the sound would either be unlistenable, or the show would be forced to end early because too many girls mobbed the stage. So we had to resort to the studio in the end."" (or words to that effect.) All the Stones (except Brian Jones) complained how girls yawned in their faces before they got famous. Then the girls went crazy for them, as you can hear on this album. Mick Jagger has said more than once, ""All women are groupies."" To hear the screaming girls on this album makes you think he was right!"
3,Brian Jones lives,Got Live was the first Stones album I heard in its entirety when I was about 11 years old. My older brothers eventually had all the Stones records and I fell in love with them too. I still love the way they dive into Get Off of My Cloud after Under My Thumb. I like the raw power and energy in Jagger's voice on Cloud. I really dig Not Fade Away on this record with Brian chugging away on the harp. He was a much better harp player than Mick would ever be. I also like to listen for his guitar line on Last Time and (Sitar?) on Cloud.
3,First Live Album,"The Rolling Stones have probably released more live albums than any other rock band in history. got Live if you want it was their first and probably the worst. The selection of songs culls their early classics, but the fact that a couple of the songs were actually recorded in the studio with crowd noise added, you feel like you kind of get cheated. Concerts at this time, were more for girls to go and scream at their idols and the bands really didn't experiment much. There are serviceable versions of their big hits with ""Get Off My Cloud"", ""Under My Thumb"", ""19th Nervous Breakdown"" and ""Have You seen Your Mother Baby, Standing In The Shadows"" standing out. Not the high point of their career, but not the piece of junk that some have categorized it as."
3,History - Simple as that,"Of course this isn't gonna sound like some clean live album from 1999- but this gives you a clear feel for the mania that was the Stones! The crazed energy of the fans..that you just don't get anymore..except in a violent way. The chicks were crazy, the crowds unmanageable. This is before the 'boys' heads were so big and they got so deep into drugs and the dark side. Lady Jane is a classic trip to England."
4,Amazed,"I purchased this holster for my S&W model 64, 3in barrel. I have no problem with concealing the gun at the 3 o'clock position. You will need a good stiff belt, as with all holsters, to acchieve close carry. Very pleased with the product."
2,Very non Xmas Carols,This CD sounds like a group of harpies attempting to lure Polish sailors onto snow covered rocks. There is none of the warmth and love that these beloved carols usually convey. There seems to be a battle being waged between the singers and the orchestra. I tossed it in the trash barrel where it belongs.....Polish Insult
2,Lutoslawski carols review,"Not to my taste. More operatic/classical performance pieces than choral or caroling, with some very strange, almost ""abstract"" tracks at the end of the CD. Well produced, etc., but I don't think most people would purchase this CD intending to listen to what is on it. More ""art"" than a ""true koledy"" collection."
2,Polish or Opera ?????,"Quite frankly, I was very disappointed in this selection. I read the reviews on how easy it was to follow, etc... I did not understand a word of it. This really sounds like a soprano opera. I had my grandparents and parents listen and no one had any idea. If you are expecting any song that you may recognize, think again."
3,Iffy,"still don't know much about paperclay and what is the ""Rosette Stone Clay""....that is low fire. The high fire recipe is scrap clay with additives....nothing exact...well, that is how clay is...try it and try it and try it.....book could be more worked out...."
5,Pulsating Picotto,"Mauro Picotto is a an extraodinary dj/producer and this CD showcases his talents as a producer. Nearly all of his hits are included on 'the album'. From 'Pulsar' to 'Like This Like That' it includes Picotto's highlights from the past few years. This album is a little softer than most of the music Picotto tends to play during a live set, although it is still on the harder side of trance. For a good example of the harder sound he has as a dj, try to find a copy of his live set from the Turbinenhalle (2000). If you are a fan of Picotto, 'the album' is an easy way to get most of his singles in one place. Great CD to listen to the whole way through, even if the tracks are only partially mixed together."
4,ABKCO FINDS TRUE STEREO GEMS!,"I was hugely disappointed with most of the early ABKCO Rolling Stones ""remasters"" on CD (What? ""Between The Buttons"" in MONO? And what SOUNDS like 3rd Generation MONO, at that). I was AMAZED when I played ""The Rolling Stones NOW"" to find that Abkco used TRUE STEREO MASTERS of ""Down The Road Apiece, What A Shame, and Heart Of Stone!"" That alone is worth the price of the disc!"
5,Comprate este disco,"Cinco estrellas son pocas. Una maravilla de disco, definitivamente el segundo mejor disco de la época de Brian Jones (el primero indiscutiblemente ""Beggars Banquet""). Tiene de todo Blues R&B, Rock and Roll. No vale la pena comentar canción por canción. Todo lo que esta incluido aqui es excelente. Realmente imperdonable que no tengas este disco"
2,Now what?,"This is basically a bastardised version of the band's second album, named -- in an absolute moment of inspired genius -- 'The Rolling Stones II'. The band originals aren't up to much -- Surprise Surprise defines the phrase 'throwaway', and Heart Of Stone is basically a rewrite of Jerry Ragavoy's Time Is On My Side -- but the covers are pretty good and show off the soul groove Watts, Wyman and Richards were developing. Docked a point because it's sequenced with no thought whatsoever."
5,Delivers the image.,It'll take some playing around to master it but right out of the box without even opening the manual I was able to get smoother pictures than handheld and that's big!
1,SIZING IS WRONG!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ORDERING THIS PRODUCT!!If I could give this ZERO stars I would. It gets 1 star for being a pink camo t-shirt otherwise I am 100% disappointed with this product. I ordered a woman's XL shirt to wear for the Susan G Koman Walk and what I got MIGHT fit a 3 year old. I wish I could add a picture to show a comparison to the small shirt I ordered (from another site) for my 10 year old. The XL shirt is considerably smaller than the small and it's even too small for my 10 year old to wear. Then when I washed it thinking that maybe my friends 3 yr old daughter could wear it, it SHRANK some more! 90% cotton, 10% spandex blend OBVIOUSLY the material wasn't pre-washed before assembly. Again, do not waste your money on this product."
1,DO NOT ORDER,"I ordered a ladies size Large and it might fit my 10 year old granddaughter!! As I was looking at it and kinda stretched it to see if could possibly fit, the color distorted with the white spandex showing through. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT"
3,Great Action but no plot!,"Well this is a pretty good movie when one considers the action sequences,but there is no plot!(Well practicaly)The ONLY reason to buy this one is for the ACTION!"
2,why does rodman act?,dissapointing van Damme movie ...mainly because of the very bad acting and irritating Rodman...not much of a good plot to it......just some nice action scenes....only for action and van Damme fans!
4,Rodman Freakshow meets Van Damme Muscle Hour,"An interesting teaming of Rodman & Van Damme. Rodman being the casually dangerous Arms Dealer with an unseemly fetish for body piercing, tatoo and other forms of pain. Oh, not too mention his Hypercolor hair & synthetic (literally) dress sense. Van Damme, playing the Super 007, who fails to take out the mastermind bad-guy, but then comes back from the dead to save his family (Awww, how sweet, and yet so unpredictable.) If you like seeing bullets, bikes, bad haircuts and bombs, then this movie is for you. If you are looking for a serious Van Damme flick then steer clear."
4,"Explosive,action packed adventure.","This flick was the most amount of fun I've had in ages,and it was easily the best Van Damme film since Street Fighter. How this only got a limited theatre release is quite beyond me."
4,great action only matched by knock off,"this movie pays tribute to the hong kong action classics. machine gun suitcases, tigers, guns, and explosions. the plots holds together quite nicely througout the entire film and the soundtrack rocks. this movie is packed with non-stop acton that will make you want to see it again and again. if you liked Knock Off you'll love this movie."
3,HAD THE MAKING OF BEING SOMETHING GOOD,"WHAT CAN I POSSIBLE SAY ,THE STORY COULD HAVE GREAT AND IT MIGHT HAVE LAUNCHED VAN DAMMME TO STARDOM,ONE PROBLEM MISTER RODMAN,WHY COULD THE HAVE PICKED HIM TO ACT WITH SOMEONE ELSE,I THINK VAN DAMME WILL HAVE SLIPPED FURTHER DOWN THE SCALE WITH THIS ONE.PLEASE LET HIM MAKE SOMETHING GOOD AGAIN LIKE HARDTARGET OR TIMECOP,VAN DAMME WAS COMING CLOSE TO THE TOP AND THEN HE JUST LOST IT ALL,I AM A VERY BIG FAN AND I HOPE HE GETS HIS ACT TOGETHER, KNOCK OFF IS A IMPROVEMENT BUT HE CAN DO A LOT BETTER END"
1,DOUBLE FAILURE,"You take an once great martial-arts actor, adds a basketball player who seems to be destroying his sports career by his own freewill,takes another actor who, by his own freewill, almos destroyed his own face going prize fighting (Rourke), then apparently takes a six-year old kid to write a script, and you have as result this ""movie""."
1,HORRID MOVIE,"Van Damme has been in some bad flicks, but this takes the cake. With uninspired acting and blatenly fake action scenes (including running through explosions, and hiding behind SODA MACHINES to avoid others) it was filled with plot holes, and was boring even for an action movie AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
2,Double Team Review,"It has overused cliches form the 1980's even though this was made in 199[bleeping]7. It also has dumb[bleep] basketball puns from Dennis Rodman who has little screentime in the film. Even Mike Awesome had more screentime while he was in WWE. Jean-Claude Van Damme has the acting skills of a drunk 4 year old. Slam Master J can outact this guy. The freeze editing in this film is weird like Weird Al. Get it? Worst of all,the idea of Jean-Claude Van Damme & Dennis Rodman teaming is weird and make no sense. I seen better team-ups in WCW during it's dying years. The only best of the film is the explosion of the colosseum. I give this movie a 2 out of 10."
3,OH NO! It's Van Damme and Rodman.,"Jean-Claude Van Damme joins forces with basketball player/wrestler/entertainer Dennis Rodman (sans wedding dress) in his acting debut. What's next? Steven Seagal and Ja Rule? Oh nevermind.This movie marked the end of Van Damme's run as a box-office champion and thankfully stopped Rodman's acting career before it even started. All in all, this movie is actually pretty good. Well, at least the action sequences courtesy of Hong Kong director Tsui Hark are. The actors are terrible except for Mickey Rourke who is as always ""too cool for school""."
3,"The ""No-Brainer"" of all ""No-Brainers""","I know, I know, the script is horrid, as well as the acting. This movie may have one-liners taken straight out of a Bazooka Joe comic, but I just can help but be taken in with the action scenes. Tsui Hark is at his best here, (hes later at his worst with ""Knock Off""). Call it a guilty pleasure, I guess. I still laugh with excitment when I watch the scene where Van-Damme runs into that Ninja in a hotel room."
1,THIS IS A JOKE...,This movie is a joke. The only reason I didn't laugh was because I kept remembering the money I spent for watching it... Sad...
2,Rodman? What did he do do throw basketballs?,"Naw, Jean-claude could have done this movie by himself. Rodman needs to stick to basketball."
3,Not a True Live Performance,"If you like smooth, mellow pop/jazz, you will like this DVD, but primarily for the music itself. I was very disappointed in that it was a ""filmed live"" performance. This takes away from the intimacy of a ""true live"" performance and the sound also suffers. The music on this DVD was obviously taken directly from the ""Night Sessions"" CD and ""dubbed into"" the performance making it seem quite detached from the video. Although produced with Dolby Digital 5.1, the sound quality left alot to be desired. Although I'm a big fan of Chris Botti, I would not have purchased this DVD if I had known it would not be an ""actual live"" performance."
3,Bad Studio Dubbing,"I was dissapointed with the over dubbing. If I wanted a studio recording I would buy one. There is some intrisic connection you make with seeing a live performance, that doesn't always happen here.At first you might not notice the overdubbing, but after you do, you begin to question every note. I think he redoes some written solos, most of the endings etc. I'd rather hear him miss a note, than watch a disconnected video and audio. That's part of the live experience is you present yourself, warts and all, no safety net. It almost fraudulent to dub your mistakes. That's what studios are for, not stages.Beyond that, the recording is great, Obviously, he had unlimited take in the studio later. So for putting in for listening its great, but if you intend to watch intently, you will know it's not live."
2,Chris Botti Deserves Better!,"I'm a Chris Botti fan - make no mistake about that. And, when I viewed this DVD, I was very impressed with his band members - most notably his most excellent drummer. However, it is extremely obvious (even to the untrained eye) that this recording has been edited, and not edited very well! The editing is so poor, I would have to advise against purchasing this DVD.Hold out - Chris is too good a musician for the record companies (you know them by their circling fins sticking just above the surface of the water) not to produce another DVD. The next one might just be worth buying - maybe they'll hire a competent team to record and edit the show. I am anticipating the event with great fervor!"
2,Not much meat here,"Comprehensive, yet superficial. I learned a few interesting things, but the book doesn't really contain information on HOW to do anything--it is just ABOUT. Misses the mark."
2,Out of Date,"This work was published in 1995, it seemed out of date, and out of touch. The media that came with it was a 3.5"" floppy disk."
2,uncomfortable,The Propet Women's Valley Walker have been a disappointment. I really don't find them comfortable. Not enough cushion.
2,sizing way off,"not true to size, I ordered my regular size, should have ordered 2 sizes bigger and a wider shoe, its very narrow and stiff"
3,Good basic walking shoe,"the shoe is very basic and wholesome- the oatmeal of footwear.The fit is comfy and feels like walking on pillows. My only problem was not with the shoe, but that I was sent the wrong size. I ordered 10 and was given an 11!!!The price of the shoe was so low that it didn't make sense to ship it back, and by the time I received them the shoe was out of stock in my size, so I wore the too big size for a while..."
4,Works well,"Fits my 14"" Calphalon pan well enough to simmer foods. Domed to allows for food to rise and not stick to the lid but it takes up quite a bit of storage space."
3,Loads of information. Difficult to read,"I am a graduate student and this book is required for one of my classes. Yes, Kazdin gives loads of important to know information. He even has tons of examples, but he has a poor writing style. His use of language makes the book difficult to read. He tends to make relatively simple concept very difficult to get through simply because he too verbose...if you do not know what verbose means then do not attempt to buy the book because words like that will be the least of your problems here. The subject index is also severely lacking."
5,"Loaded with information, but easy to read","This is one of very few textbooks that I won't be selling back. Every page is loaded with information, yet it is an easy read. Everything is written in way that is easy to understand."
4,very informative,"for review, for initial learning. good one, has case studies and examples. somewhat dry but this is a classic for all researchers"
5,Music Therapist's perspective,I really have enjoyed reading this book so far. The text is easy to comprehend and the examples the author gives are fundamental to my understanding.
4,Makes me want to learn more,"This is a great text. I've learned a lot about Single Case Research thanks to this text, which was required reading for a graduate course I am taking. I would recommend this book if you need to learn about this style of research design. Kazdin has a good sense of humor that is sprinkled through the book and helps keep the sometimes-dry material a bit more entertaining to read. I want to learn more about SSRD now, thanks to the class and this book. :)"
4,A true diamond in the rough!,"This is a great CD, i would recomend it to anyone. The tight harmonies, great solo work (i wish there was more though) and their great versatility musicly is great to hear from a band like this. The whole CD has a Rage Against the Machine meets Suger-Ray quality to it. This is a CD every rage fan (or any one else for that matter) should check out."
2,The cd is OK,"this cd aint great i know good thecno and this aint great but its got some good stuff like ""this is normal"" as i said it aint great so i woulnt sugest buyin it"
4,An overall amazing compilation,"Some of this stuff is amazing. There are weak moments - if you're thinking of getting this just because you're a Morricone fan, beware - Gusgus' mindless butchering of Good, the Bad and the Ugly is horrible. But mostly this collection should please just about anyone. Which is hard to say for an electronic release. The Rip Off Artist's take on Dean Martin's ""Sway"" has to be heard to be believed. Everyone I've played it for has just had their jaw drop. ""Watermelon Fan"" is great fun as well, as are a few other standout tracks. You won't be sorry for having gotten this. The only reason I wouldn't rank it a 5-star thingy is because the Gusgus remix is a prime example of everything wrong about bad remixing. Otherwise though people will think ""you da man!"" (or woman as the case may be) for playing this at your next swingin' soiree."
3,Tennessee maybe?,"The reviewer from Cape Cod may be generally accurate, but maps do show Kentucky's neighbor to the south, Tennessee, contains both a Palmer, southeast of Nashville, and a Boston, southwest of Nashville."
2,Cats are better!,"As an animal lover and mystery buff, I expected more from this series, but after the first few chapters of this one, I lost interest. These dogs are not real -- and neither are the people. I mean, who in their right mind would tell people at a party that the snacks you brought were leftovers from your mom's poker game? Please!! Conclusion: Cats are better."
2,Melissa Cleary needs help,"I thought that the first two books were good (not great but good). Unfortunately, Cleary has a large chip on her shoulder and a bad memory. Most of the characters are divorced or end up divorced later on in the series. The main character's friends turn on her in later books. Palmer is set near Boston in the first book and yet later is set in the midwest (""Over there is the Kentucky border,"" remarks a character. Kentucky must be a town in Massachusetts.). Cleary must have had a terrible life to concoct such depressing stories. I refuse to purchase any more of her books and plan on trashing the ones I own. I wouldn't dare put anyone through such misery."
3,I am a journaler,"If you aren't into writing this may not be for you. I jotted things down and really enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed my other journal better though, it was hardcover and you could add memorabilia better. But, it's a great book for a journal happy mommy to be."
2,Pregnancy Diary,I was given this as a gift and wasn't too happy with it. The first two weeks are irrelevant since you don't know you are pregnant until you are at least 2 weeks pregnant. And the spining is falling apart and pages are falling out. I'd recommend a spiral bound or sewn in spining. The book does have some good journaling questions and entries for reflection. But what good is that worth if the book falls apart?
3,disappointed in this children's book,"Having heard several times that this book and its companion, Mouse Paint, were clever and fun reads for children, we got this book, but I was pretty disappointed. While the artwork is charming, the premise of the story is that sleeping mice are being stored in a jar to be eaten later by a snake. Like another reviewer, when reading aloud I skip the snake repeatedly describing them as ""little, warm and tasty"". The idea of the mice cleverly escaping and then counting down as they escape is good, but I don't find that the ""counting up"" is particularly well done, so that children don't necessarily develop a better understanding of counting or numbers. To be honest, our toddler likes the book, so I've given it three stars, but IMHO there are much better books for children out there."
2,Serial killers give this to their kids,"My own fault I guess. I should have read the reviews for this book before purchasing it. I just assumed that the wonderful author of Mouse Paint would have a similar charm for this book.I'm sure you read the gist in other reviews. The snake is collecting each ""tasty"" mouse to be eaten later.This is reminiscent of the old fables where bad things happen to the characters. The mice do make their escape.This book got two stars because the bloodbath didn't occur and the mice are indeed cute.Now I have to decide if it's worth returning or if I should give it away and traumatize someone else's children."
5,We love Bionicles!,"This purchase completes one of the Bionicles collections for my grandson. We've been collecting them since they were first introduced, and my grandson just loves them. With a little imagination, he invents his own characters, taking pieces from several others. Bionicles are excellent building/thinking products. I wouldn't really call them toys. They're much more than that!"
2,nice...but missing pieces,my son was very happy when he saw this toy for christmas.... it is very nice! it's legos...but very nice.the only thing is that when we start building...the pieces weren't complete! there were missing 4 pices of lego!
1,have you ever stepped on one of these in the middle of the night??,OMG!!! It's 3am and you need to take a pee. You step quietly down the hallway not wanting to wake the kids. Then CRUNCH!! Pain like no other. You scream onto your fist hopping up and down on one foot. A tear runs down the side of your face. The dog starts barking then you stumble into that floor lamp you asked your wife not to buy. The comotion wakes the baby then your wife. Your wife already mad about the night before blames you for the mess and demands you clean it up then take care of the baby. You crawl back into bed at 530 am to get 30 min sleep before you need to get up. Your foot throbs and your curse under your breath waking your wife again. Angry she turns on the light just to keep you from that 30 minutes of sleep you were needing. DON'T BUY THIS TOY!!! IT RUINED MY LIFE!!!
2,A good beginner's book but full of errors.,"This is both a good book and a bad book for beginners on the subject of op amps. It's a good book because it presents the basics of op amp circuitry in a concise, straight forward manner without getting bogged down in a lot of theory and mathamatics, and it is well organized. However, it is a bad book because it is full of errors which even a moderately experienced reader might spot but which may confuse someone new to op amps. Errors like incompreshesible sentences, errors in equations, equation variables that don't match the circuit diagrams, missing figures, and wrong figures. Someone, probably non-technical, did a lousy job of proofreading.I would not recommend this book to learn op amps. And if you can spot the mistakes, you already know op amps and you don't need this book either."
4,"Good book for beginner, but full of typos","Joe Carr has a very clear writing style and illustrates all concepts with simple circuits. His general approach is that of an electronics technologist educating a hobbyist or technician. He does a great job at this, but unfortunately devotes no effort to proof-reading. This third book in the series is still flawed by numerous mismatches between text and schematics, improper symbols, etc. This will be very frustrating for the novice and obscures the points involved. Mr. Carr obviously cares little for his own work, since he has not moved to correct these glaring errors in this series."
3,Wrong size,"This review is not about the holster itself as I never got a chance to properly use it. Jak Slide holsters come in several different sizes and styles identified by a manufacturers model number. Unfortunately the Amazon listings do not use a model number so there's no accurate way of determining whether you are ordering the right size. The ad indicated I was buying a holster sized to fit a 1911 Colt, Kimber, Springfield, etc. The holster that arrived was way too small to fit any medium or large frame pistol."
4,Fun Track!,"This is the opening track from his excellent debut album.If you have the patience I'd wait to purchase the album,but it seems to be taking an age to get released in the States.If you can't wait you should by the album anyway.This was a huge hit over here in Europe all last summer.It's sort of acoustic country music meets hip-hop.The country comes from the basic sounds of the guitars and of course Downs deep,rich vocal tones.The hip-hop comes from the beats and the hilarious rapper that interjects in each verse.The track is really good as it tells the story of a fresh kid arriving from the country to New York.It seems everyone can spot how green he is and they all seem to take advantage in his ensuing misfortune-except the track does have a happy ending.It's a very good track that has more then just a novelty appeal-but there are better tracks on the album."
2,Not what I expected,"Don't waste your money. Like the previous review, I too was expecting a cool angel design like the one in the picture for the listing. Instead I received a horrid, washed-up picture on the pick that barely resembled an angel. I am giving this two stars since at least I was able to return it to the seller for a refund. I lost my money for the shipping however which was expensive since I live in Canada."
3,Too many irons in one fire,"This attempt by Brian Nystul would have been a great book if he hadnt tried to do so much forshadowing. There is just too much going on that isnt connected with the story. This is one book that didnt need a tie in with the Davion civil war, or the quick piece with the Black Dragons (yes they're back or will be). Too much was attempted too soon. A longer build up to the war between the Draconis Combine and the Ghost Bears would have been nice as well. We've heard about this in other books, but a fully fleshed out text would have been better. When I put the book down it left me unfulfilled. Battletech fans...better pick this one up though. With the sale of the Battletech property from FASA, this and the next one might be the last we see for some time."
2,Mixed feelings,"This book definately isn't anywhere near other battletech novels dealing with the clans.It may very well be 10 years into the truce that made the clan invasion come to a halt, and clanners had most likely had to adapt to living in the sphere (especially the ghost bears), but the way it's depicting in this book is causing unneccesary chills.The clan language and culture is mangled beyond belief. Dialogs between clanners are written as friendly banter, with no regard to ranks or status. Personal honour and accomplishments are replaced by friendships and ""helping your fellow peers in need"".Nystul should keep to designing games, and leave writing to people that know how it's done.To anyone interested in clan society, I'd recommand reading the Jade Phoenix Trilogy by Robert Thurston instead."
5,The debut collection of her poetry,"Natasha Trethewey has won the Grolier Poetry Prize and her individual pieces have been widely published in a variety of places. Domestic Work is the debut collection of her poetry and will well serve to introduce her work to a whole new audience of appreciative readers. Housekeeping: We mourn the broken things, chair legs/wrenched from their seats, chipped plates,/the threadbare clothes. We work the magic/of glue, drive the nails, mend the holes./We save what we can, melt small pieces/of soap, gather fallen pecans, keep neck bones/for sou. Beating rugs against the house,/we watch dust, lit like stars, spreading/across the yard. Late afternoon, we draw/the blinds to cool the rooms, drive the bugs/out. My mother irons, singing, lost in reverie./I mark the pages of a mail-order catalog,/listen for passing cars. All day we watch/for the mail, some news from a distant place."
4,Pretty good...,"This is well-written, honest poetry, with its own sound. Its pleasures are traditional, and no less satisfying for it. One wonders why the poet only writes about what's past, though. Everyone writes about the past, of course, but a whole book of it begins to feel a bit like an evasion."
2,Nostalgia,"These poems seem tense, circumscribed, hemmed in. Although not strictly speaking ""nostalgic"" they come too close. There is a cramped, careful almost fussy feeling to the writing. Why write poetry to this effect?"
2,Something Off,"Funny that there are two reviews here back to back about the creepy feeling one gets that this is a collection of politically correct poetry, which, in other words, means it's not a collection of poetry per se. It may be a collection of somehting else--perhaps little anecdotal race memoirs in verse--but it is not poetry. I'm glad I'm not the only one to have been disappointed by the book and quite a bit put off."
1,Are Kidding Me?,"Oh ok, so poetry now is anything that is about political correctness? This is artless, dull, self obsessed."
1,Sorry For ONly One Star,"I heard this author read recently. What struck me was how hard she was trying to ""sell"" these poems as she read, as if they appeal weren't apparent on their own, that they needed her acting them out like a news reporter or something. And then it struck me that the stuff just isn't any good. I bought the book afterward because I felt bad for her. But I'll admit that two days later I returned it to the store. Sorry. One star."
1,"Throw you obsolete junk away, don't sell it","This piece of junk is for iPods sold SEVERAL years ago and doesn't work with any 30 pin or shuffle iPods. When your stuff is obsolete, do the world a favor and toss it!"
5,Gypsy Works for Me!,What a great cd! Always listen to the samples before I buy... And this was ano brainer. Some of her songs are in the movie Ratatouille.
3,So-so!,Still not sure about this one. Have only listened to it once and didn't think it was that special. Love her voice but not crazy about the arrangements. The jury's still out on this one.
5,Great info for crafters!,This is the most thorough informative information on craft shows available!
5,Much Mahalos,"Apologies for the late reply I've just been watching my movie over & over & over............ I am a HUGE Jerry Lewis fan & this is my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE!! I dont even know if THANK YOU!!! s enough of a sentiment to express how happy i am with my purchase. You've put a smile on my face so huge it can be seen from Mars!!Signed, A Future/Long Term CustomerNikkiaI"
2,Missing lots of footage on DVD,"Ok, I had this film on 16mm years ago and watching the DVD, I found lots of footage missing. Not only is there sections missing, but one that stands out is when his Fairy Godfather is making his bike into a car and his goldfish into the driver. Way too much footage missing to enjoy. Not sure why they cut this classic up but hopefully the older VHS version is complete."
1,Painfully slow,"What is wrong with all the other reviewers? This film is utter tedium! Boring with a capital B! It's so slow I could graduate from Uni, pop out a few grandkids and it'd still be playing! There are so many long silences, depressing music; stay clear at all costs! I love Nutty Prof and The Patsy, but this one's a shocker!"
4,fun,"Got this for my kids-a good, fun sound to regular Christmas songs. We've enjoyed listening to it & singing along. :)"
5,Nazz Nazz,"I actually like this record better then their first. Stand out tracks ""Forget about It"" ""Rain Rider"" ""Under the Ice."" Band members are Todd Rundgren lead guitar Carson van Osten bass guitar Tom Mooney drums Stewkey vocals piano organ."
2,It's nice but too small,I wish I would have read somewhere that this is only half a gallon. It would have been amazing if it was a gallon. It looks nice but too small.
3,like westerns but!,grey almost has too many descriptive words. was tiresome reading all of them. book didnt get interesting till the last third of it.
5,"uplifting, inspirational music","This is one devotional music collection that I can't quite stop listening to. There is no review that I can write which would do justice to it. I first heard Karnamrita play at the Yoga Farm in Grass Valley, CA. Her voice was so enchanting I had to buy her CD. I've listened to it countless times in my car."
3,Good boombox,"This is a sturdy boombox. The sound is clear and strong. My only complaint is that the controls are difficult to locate and it has MP3 player bay, but does not accept MP4, but that was my mistake, I thought the connection would be the same. It is fairly large and heavy, but I bought it for my 8 year old son, so that's good because it is less likely to be thrown around."
3,A Diamond in the weeds,"The story of this album is as follows: London Records cleans out the Stones vaults in 1967 and repackage a couple of recent singles to cash in on the psychedelic craze while the Stones take their time working on their follow-up to ""Between The Buttons"". There ARE some gems here on this album of leftovers if you're a Stones freak, notably two tracks left off the U.S version of Between The Buttons, ""Please Go Home"" and ""Back Street Girl"", as well as an obscure B-side or two. Not bad if you're looking for a mid-sixties ""Greatest Hits"" of sorts but there are better places for the casual fan to look, notably the ""Hot Rocks"" collections or ""High Tide"" single disc."
3,good things come to those who wait,"well you may not get your yaya's out on this one, but it is still a decent album. Stones are strayin from the delta, but not from the psychedelics. i think most people can dig on this album.(preferebly stones fans)"
5,The album's beautiful. No more needed to say.,"A great effort by all five of the band's members, the last album on which Brian Jones has a prominent place. He was fading fast. Especially love ""My Girl"" and ""Back Street Girl""."
3,PRETTY CONSISTENT,"THIS IS REALLY A PRETTY CONSISTENT ALBUM FROM THE MID SIXTIES ERA,CONTAINING MOTHERS LITTLE HELPER,LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT,RUBY TUESDAY,AND A HOST OF OTHERS.I EVEN THINK THE VERSION OF ""MY GIRL"" IS PRETTY GOOD,BUT A LOT OF PEAPLE KNOCK IT,FOR SOME REASON.THIS IS ACTUALLY RECOMENDED OVER BETTER KNOWN TITLES LIKE BEGGERS BANQUET AND REQUEST,AS THERE REALLY ARN'T ANY BIG DUDS ON THIS ONE."
4,Thoughtful,"I liked the way this book explored the motiviations, consequences, and aftermath of puruing or not pursuing romantic love. Like all French thinkers on the subject, the effects on the children are glossed over in the selfishness of pursuing personal fullfillment of romantic desires. Yes, there is some courage to pursuing romantic love and ditching your family, however why can't people wait until the kids are grown?"
2,"Oysters, no pearl.","As much as I liked Gavalda's first short stories book (I Wish Someone Were Waiting for Me Somewhere - a great great book), I didn't feel this one contained enough material to make one single short story...which it unfortunately wasn't. A book perfectly adapted to speed reading, emptier than a book by Marc Levy, with less reflexions about love than you could get by - for example - watching a documentary on the reproduction of oysters in captivity. Too bad with such a title. Neeeext."
5,Fantastic guide to Cubase.,"I find this a facinating book that helps to quickly knock down the learning curve of Cubase SX. To me it's easier to digest than the manual supplied with Cubase. I have Cubase 1.0 and Cubase Studio 4, it seems to be adequate for this and in between. From setting up your first audio or midi recording, to editing, to mastering, it seems to cover all aspects in a reasonable sized book. I can't think of much that could be done to improve it. I highly recommend this for anyone who has a desire to dive into computer based recording. It even give brand name mic and interface hardware recommendations. I sat down at a local national bookstore and combed over 3 different guides to Cubase and this one clearly excelled, prompting me to purchase it. This is one I never lend out!"
3,Does the trick... but not the best.,"This boat cover disappointed me a little bit. It does the trick, but for off season storage, might want to get a shrink wrap. Otherwise you'll need to use posts to keep water from pooling. Straps dont tighten the canvas enough to repel all puddling. And the tie downs straps, buckles, etc. are a bit on the cheap side. Good canvas material otherwise, and for the price its an OK deal. Id spring for custom covers from the boat manufacturer (17 ft. Four Winns) if I could do it all over again... and still just might."
4,Works as Well as the Name Brands,The only real attraction of this item is its price. It is less explensive than the name brands but works just as well in my Seiko label printer. I am going to keep using them.
2,Save your money,"I would recommend the other DVD called ""Elton John Rock Case Studies"" instead. That DVD has one extra person giving commentary (the guy who brought Elton and Bernie together). This ""Music in Review"" DVD shows the same 1984 Sydney concert over and over again. It is cloudy footage to boot. I doubt I will watch it again. However, the critics who give commentary were very detailed. They appear again in the other DVD. I also was dissappointed that they did not review albums from the last 20 years. Save your $17.99 plus shipping and go for the other DVD."
2,Going by the reviews only.....,"As a big fan of EJ I was hoping that there would be rare footage of him in concert,but thanks to the reviews,I decided not to buy this.How come there isn't any old concerts on dvd?? When I heard DREAM TICKET was coming out,I bought it,but was a little bit disappointed that it had one concert that was already available on dvd and others I've already seen,except for just one.How about putting together a dvd that has the DODGER STADIUM doc from 1975? Or the doc EJ and Bernie Taupin Say Goodbye to Norman Jean and Other Things from 1973?? Or how about the solo Edinburgh concert from 1976?? Or how about the concert from Wembley Arena from 1977 where he announced he was retiring from touring that was originally on HBO??? There's so much stuff that we EJ fans would love to have! How about all of his music videos?? I don't mind having concerts that are more recent,but it would be nice(better than nice actually)if there were more from the 70's instead! Skip this dvd indeed..."
3,Could you walk on the water?,"It beggars belief that this miserly 12-track US compilation is available on CD instead of the UK edition, which featured more music, all the Stones' A-sides up till the end of 1966, and a better cover. Just chalk it up to good ol' record company exploitation. If you want the early classic singles on a well-compiled CD, you're out of luck, so this or the exorbitantly priced Hot Rocks (or the even more exorbitantly priced London Years set) will have to do. Sigh."
3,If you can get past the sound quality...,"...it's a decent album. The two extended songs on this album are pretty much par for the course, as far as this period in Coltrane's career. It is very similar to ""Live at the Village Vanguard Again!"", with Coltrane giving a lot of equal time to Pharoah Sanders.The only problem is the sound quality of the live recording. The tape is very oversaturated and the bass really crunches out most of the time. You can also hear drop-outs and other tape anomolies that make this CD a difficult listen if you are hearing it on headphones.I would say that this is a definite must-have for hardcore Coltrane fans, but not for the casual Coltrane listener."
2,Sound quality is horrible,"The music is very spiritual and intense but the sound quality is so horrible that it's not worth listening to. It sounds like a home tape, the microphone was just too close. There is just too much noise.I am a die hard Coltrane addict but I have to pass this one up. It just isn't worth it. There is a reason why this recording was never released..."
1,Sadly Noisy,"Ogunde begins like a intense, beautiful cry but then it turns into something that seems more like if a million of cats started to fight each other, and there's nothing to say about My Favourite Things...disappointing, this is a really disappointing album"
1,Cheap & Doesn't work,"Neon light does not work, Made out of cheap plastic, Very expensive for the item received! Will not do business with company again."
2,Diver Vs Scientist,"Nice book although more for a scientist/student than a aquarium hobbyist or diver.Pictures are OK, names of corals and sea fans are not consistent with other books.Lots of information but again still very hard to identify corals in the book to corals and sea fans taken underwater!Better books on the market!"
5,CASA DE LA TROVA- Various Artists,"""Casa De La Trova"" is a delightful compilation of traditional cuban romantic songs. This CD has an impressive cover which features a portrait of the late composer Juana Gonzalez who's style and compositions such as ""En Guantanamo"", ""El Guajiro de Cunagua"", etc. influenced cuban music. The album title song should be ""El Misterio de Tus Ojos"" composed by Juana's husband, Daniel Castillo who gives us an interesting narration stating that his late wife of 53 years, was the main source of his songwriting inspirations. A ""traditional trova"" all-star cast featuring Las Hermanas Faez, Las Hermanas Ferrin, Trio Miraflores, Cascarita (caution not Orlando Guerra-Cascarita), Zaida Reyte, Lucia Lago(the only surviving member of the famous ""Trio Hermanas Lago""), Alfredo Alonso, Lusson Bueno and Daniel Castillo, make this album a must buy for all traditional music lovers."
4,Nice product.,"It is a very good product. However it is not easy to setup under Windows Vista, but don't blame the product, the problem is in Windows Vista."
4,Cheap and simple to use.,"This item is very useful for the price. I bought it just to backup the info from my Palm Centro. I had no problem using it. Windows Vista immediately recognized the device and installed drivers for it. I cannot say anything about the included software, because I did not use it. It works fine for me with the software that came with my Centro. I would recommend this product to others."
3,NOT 33 FT. but pairs like a charm.... after a little tweaking.,"I'm not sure if it's 33 ft of unobstructed space, or just 33 ft. But with my jabra bluetooth headset, it starts crackling at 10 ft. Although I bought this one primarily to transfer data to and from my cell phone... and with data transfer, I can go a little bit further but definitely not 33 ft.Yes, you read me right the first time, it pairs with bluetooth headsets that say ""wireless headset for MOBILE PHONES""... all in all I've successfully paired all bluetooth compatible phones/devices in this house... and sent/received files to and from them.One thing, though... the included software wasn't up to par so I had to install the latest Bluesoleil software. (Running WinXP-SP2) Thus the three stars. 'Coz I had to go find updates which, apparently, the cd installation doesn't provide (for free). Otherwise, it's a real cheap working thing. =)"
4,It works and it was cheap,"I needed to get info from my PC to my my cell phone and didn't want to spend $40. After all, the phone was free. It works and does what I need for a pittance."
5,works fine,"Arrived very fast.The adapter works fine on my laptop. (pc, win xp 2002) Paring up with 2 devices with no problem. (nokia e51 and SE t-610) The price is very good."
2,hard to see,Poor quality printing. Content material seemed fasinating but I could not read this book. I had trouble reading this print since there was not enough contrast between page and ink.
5,El libro mas impresionante que he leido en los ultimos veinte años,"Rick Tarnas propone que ha descubierto la ciclicidad de los eventos historicos a partir de los aspectos astronomicos de 5 planetas que el ha estudiado. Recientemente he recibido validacion empirica de lo que el propone y ciertamente su visión de un mundo sincronistico coincide con mis experiencia de los ultimos veinte años.Ademas,me ha permitido corresponder con el y Rick es un tipazo !. Salud Rick !"
2,ABSTRACT,"This is not a grasping enjoyable read....only if you are a true scholar interested in this subject content which I was; otherwise, the item would be returned. Not for mainstream readers...which is probably a loss for the reading community."
3,Disappointed,"I had been waiting with eager anticipation for the arrival of this book and the first few chapters were excellent in style, content and accessability, but I found the astrological evidence chapters boring. I find this sort of material boring in any writer. I have no gripe with astrology and don't need to be convinced of the ""as above so below view"". If you like Richard Tarnas other writings then give it a go. I intend reading it again but will probably skim the evidence chapters again."
2,Deeply Flawed,"This book is deeply flawed. It foundational premise is utter nonsense. Tarnas has used his vast understanding of the humanties and history and attempted to correlate trends, themes, biographies and events to the movement of planets.Like all astrologers, he is attempting to merge the scientific and factual using his intuition, seeing corrlations and causes and effects when none exist. The intuitive connection between the scientfic facts and the ""facts"" of history simply does not work. The supposed correlations are simply subjective conjecture. And in the final analysis, the over arching question is ""so what?"".I found the book very disappointing in light of his brilliant Passion of the Western mind."
5,Planetary moments and human patterns,"Cultural historian Richard Tarnas' previous PASSION OF THE WESTERN MIND offered a fine survey of Western spirit: COSMOS AND PSYCHE takes it a step further, relying on thirty years of research to draw a direct connection between planetary movements and patterns of human experience. One might be tempted to think this is pop science - but Tarnas provides extensive scientific and historical links throughout and offers many new insights into connections between science and religion which deserve discussion."
2,Sexist book,This book was written solely from the viewpoint of a man - there are no women listed in the entire book.
4,A good workbook for learning to read/write kana.,"I've had this book for a while, and it teaches you alot in the way of reading kana, and also teaches quite a few words that pertain to the group you've learned and review those previous."
5,The animals have such charm,"Being a Larry myself, I had to give this a try. My two-year-old loves it, and the songs are catchy yet not too sappy. Recommended."
4,Straight Out of View- Straight out of Heaven,Straight out of view is by far one of the best books of modern poetry I have read in a long time. Joyce Sutphen has an incredible ability to express everything from the simplest feelings to the many of the most complicated problems that have ever plagued my mind. The only danger inherent in buying Straight Out of View is the possibility that you may never want to put it down.
4,"Good Graphs, but a bit thin on explanation.","I use this textbook in my Managerial Economics course. Personally, I think the graphs are very well done, but the material covered is somewhat more challenging than a typical intermediate-level textbook and requires an understanding of calculus. The verbal explanations could be better. Waldman makes somewhat ambitious efforts to cover advanced topics such in utility theory, the number of firms in monopolistic competition, and bundling."
5,Christmas Gift,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband as he loves the ""oldies but goodies"" (as do I). He had seen a TV advertisement for the Shirelles a couple of months ago and wanted to buy ""the whole set"". However, the set was quite costly so I surprised him with this single CD. He was delightfully surprised and loves it. So far, he has played it about every day since Christmas."
2,This book is lacking...,I have used exam cram books for all the exams I have done (7 so far) and this book was the worst one. I was very impressed with the others but this one is too shallow and misses out too much information. When I did practise tests there was a lot of stuff I had not come across in this book.Am afraid I can't recommend another book as this was the only one I used. Even though this was not the best book I have used I still passed the exam having never commercially used IEAK.
4,This and IEAK is all you really need.,"This exam is not as difficult as it seems. You should be able to pass with this book, and the IEAK (<---- USE IT!).Patrick"
4,"Good overview, but it dosen't cover everything...","This book contains a good overview of what is on the 70-79 exam. I still came across a few questions on the exam that were not covered in this book (or covered in any other book for the 70-79 exam). Definately useful in studying for the exam, but expect questions from out of left field."
2,Some good practice amid a sea of wasted paper,"The explanations are rudimentary, and some of the answers are WRONG! Some of the rules don't coincide with the explanations... they probably should have had someone actually DO the problems before putting this book to print. Don't get this book if you're not clueless -- you could find better practice elsewhere"
2,Confusing for those preparing for LSAT...,"I purchased this book to prepare for the LSAT. The examples where either almost identical to previous LSAT questions or had been slightly altered. While this would seem like the appropriate types of problems to practice with, one is probably better off purchasing the Law Services Prep Tests and studying actual problems. The way this book altered some of the questions made them unclear, confusing, and frustrating."
1,Some good practice amid a sea of wasted paper,You can find better practice elsewhere -- these questions are sometimes muddled and vague.
4,LSAR/GRE Analytic Workout,"The LSAT/GRE Analytic Workout is invaluable to anyone who wishes to do well on the Analytic section of the LSAT. The book will save you time in preparing for the LSAT by illustrating systematic ways to break down the problems. I suggest skipping the level three questions until you can work through a majority of actual LSAT problems. There is no substitute for practicing actual LSAT questions, but I recommend learning the concepts in this book before tackling the analytic section of the LSAT."
1,There are better books,"I have used this book and the ARCO ""LSAT-GRE Logic Workbook"". The ARCO book is worth the money ..., the Princeton review book is not worth the money. The ARCO book is considered the best book for the the analytical reasoning section. The methods in the Princeton review book, unnecessarily complicate the analytical section."
1,This suppost be their best ? hahaha..,"People have told me that this is cof's best album...What a joke! What makes this any difirent from all of their other crappy god bashing satanic albums ? Can we say redone and pointless? Its all weak bullsh*t! Listining to music that makes you a lessor person and mediocre at best--is just truly sad and pathetic. Vampires ? Please! Children com'n now. Any of you who buy this and like it...Needs to have your brain checked or something siriously, don't bother."
5,Jacob Fred is the most incredible live show ever.,"I saw these guys in Downbeat and I bought their album. I saw them in Chicago three weeks ago and they made me drop my drawers. I play their music and it makes me crazy. Go see them, you will thank me."
4,Even Better,"What can I say about JFJO? I like it! I have listened to these guys since they began and their sound and their music is developing quite well over time. Welcome Home is great a CD that showcases the talents of this young and ""on the rise"" band. I do make this request however, I want more Dove blazing guitar solos! The reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I see even better and greater things from this band in the near future!"
5,Rock the balls! Rock the balls!,ROCK THE BALLS!I have many tapes of these men and they are amazing live. Catch them next time they tour. WELCOME HOME is beautiful love.
4,How about more CDs?,I happen to like 'Live in Tokyo' much better than this one and I saw a bunch of shows before they became heard of. Seems like the guys got a lot mellower. I wish that Amazon.com offered more JFJO's CD's for sale. Definitely worth listening.
4,I like this album for a friend,"Although, I wouldn't want to commit to anything romantic, per se, i really would love to see this album more often, perhaps go see a movie with it. I think it sounds great when it first starts up spinning (the CD) there is this kind of whispery sound and then a space of silence which is like heaven. Then it kinda goes south."
3,Lacking some sonic and musical quality,"I was not familiar with Peter Mendoza, but am a big fan of Al Bowlly. These songs are all fine, but not wonderful, sounding like the material in any number of Fred/Ginger films. And the sonics on them sound a tad over-cleaned. There is a hollowness that is not present on my other recordings from the same period. Though it's always a pleasure to find new material, Al's voice sounds better elsewhere, and the liner notes could offer a bit more info--there is very little describing the performers (I guess it is unavaliable--but for a full-price CD I'd like more)."
4,ksquilter,The only thing about this product is that when I received it the part of the case that holds the dvd in place was broken so the dvd was rattling around. Haven't heard that it damaged the dvd as this was a gift.
5,love it!,"I love this movie. It is very good. I originally thought it was going to be like 8 Seconds, but I was wrong."
2,Not great,This movie could had been better had it offered an interesting story and better acting. The only one into this project is Keifer Sutherland. The others basically coast through their parts. Darryl Hanna is virtually non-existent and Molly Ringwald does not have much to do. The ending makes no sense either. It does give you some sense of how hard (insane) the whole bull riding thing is but that does not make up for the film's serious defects. I want my 100 minutes back.
2,Bull Snot in Slow Motion,"While watching this movie I got the impression that bulls move very, very slowly... but then I realized it was just slow motion photography. Lots of s l o w m o t i o n p h o t o g r a p hy . So much slow motion I almost fell alseep. After the movie I found myself moving around the house very slowly, so hypnotized I was by this director's excess usage of slo-mo. However, the sight of all those glistening strings of bull snot arching in slow motion across the screen ultimately kept me awake. My advice is skip this dumb movie and go see a real rodeo in real time. It'll keep you awake."
1,Animal lovers and easy cryers DO NOT watch this movie,"I highly reccomend that you DO NOT watch this movie if you are an animal lover, or an easy cryer. There is death in this movie, and VERY dramatic parts. In less you have pretty tough eyes to keep them on the screen, I would reccomend that you do not watch this. I had to run out of the room at one part of the movie, come back in, watch a while, and leave again at the end. It is not an easy movie to watch, and does not have a happy ending. I think that maybe if you do not think that you shouldn't watch this movie, maybe watch Pure Country or something. Just not this. I was just putting out a word for everyone before they watched this HORRIBLE movie.Thanks,Jan"
5,Rodeo,"This is the cowboy life! It's my life style, and what I grow up with! Nice movie! Will watch again and again!"
5,You'll get hooked like a fly in a spiders web,"I was a 14-year-old in 8th grade when I read this compelling book, ""The Forever Season"", by the ever-so-talented Don Keith. To me Don was a devious Spider, weaving his finely spun web (The Forever Season). And I, I was the defensless fly, struggling to get through the cobbwebs of suspens and mystery, only to find myself being hooked deeper into the relm of twisted strands leading their way to a shocking and unbelievable douple ending. Once I picked up this book of books, I just could not put it down. It was as if it were glued to my hands. I really related to this book, for Don wrote the majority of it in Southern slang and I'm partly from the South. When Don had put down his pen, what he had infront of him was an elaberate maze, one which you must be prepared for the unexpected to be able to escape its walls of words, and its traps of enigmatic conclusions. I truly recommend this book, for even my words don't do it justice."
4,Good enough to pass the exam!,"Good book! But the practice exams were too easy. They were nothing like the real one. So make sure you are loaded up with the Transcender exams. There are books that you wanna stop reading it, when you start reading it, and this book is not one of them. Good Luck, People!"
3,NO LONGER IN THE MAKING,Slappa stopped producing this item because of its defects yet other companies continue to sell them. My Advice? DON'T BUY IT!Pros:It's a great bagAwesome storageGreat LookingComfortableHEAVY DUTYCarries everything you need!CONS:it starts falling apart within a matter of weeks or months.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM ANY COMPANY SLAPPA DOESN'T EVEN SELL IT ANY MORE.
4,Better Than Everyone Says,"Quite a bit of mistakes, but anyone with a brain can figure it out. I actually found it very useful. And the reason it gives away the story line is because it's a strategy guide, it's supposed to tell you what to do, and to be prepared for what will happen."
4,"Very good, but needs work","They dont ad enough detail, for example it tells you to go from one place to another but doesnt tell you how to get there so you end up getting lost!!!!!! it happened to me a few times. :)"
1,Don't waste your money.,"When it comes to strategy guides, Brady knows nothing. Nothing. Oh, they also know nothing. I no doubt much prefer Kao Megura's strategy guide when he gets it written. Terrible maps. Some fool decided to put them in back. Even worse, some more foolish fool didn't number the pages. In many places they gave many spoilers (which I don't mind, actually, but in other places the lack of them left you hanging. This book is a perfect example of what happens when a fool gets bored. Didn't they test it? How could they have been so blind. This is how it goes. I'm reading and it says ""Refer to map"". What the hell? Which map? Where is this map?. I do find it after a while (all the maps _are_ there, 1 point for the away team), but(should I be suprised?) there are huge dots on this fuzzy, small map."
3,Could have taken alot of tips from Versus...,"This guide is umm well not the BEST in guides... but being as, as of this writing its the ONLY (book) guide around it sort of has to do. This guide could have taken tips from versus books(who, in my not so humble opinion, make the best guides around) they should do away with the beastiary and just have a list of monsters in each section.(flipping through and seeing certain suprise bosses REALLY blew the plot.) the guide was laden with spoilers whether or not they were intentional. it was also wrong in a few places(you can complete alot of side quests well before the books says you can.) This book should have gotten a 2 but...the fact that its the ONLY one gave it that extra star."
2,"Once again, Brady's proven it knows zero about game guides..","At first glance this guide appears to be great. Lots of information, item locations (sort of), info about the Guardian Forces, etc... However, once you get into playing the game, you realize what a terrible book this truly is. The item placement is not always correct, and even worse is that the maps are all in the back of the book! Now, this wouldn't be a huge problem if Brady had gone a little bit farther and included at least page numbers, but that couldn't be done either. Another problem I had with the book was the one thing that Brady always has, and always will, have; they give plot spoilers continuously! Be careful about reading this book, because Brady does not understand the concept of ""give hints, not story."" So, if you'd like to know the plot without playing the game, the Bradygames Final Fantasy 8 guide is a great novel.. but as a game guide, it isn't even average. Avoid at all costs."
2,Its okay.,"I LOVE Final Fantasy 8. Its a great game. The stratagy guide was great while the first time playing the game. Although some things were confusing, I didn't really think about it. Later I noticed the millions of typos and missleading information. It seems to me, the people who wanted this book out, didn't care if it wasn't done. When it comes to important items (like the Moon Stone, which I still haven't found for Irvine's best weapon) you haven't a clue where to get them. And basic informaiton (like, who is Zell's GF) you never can find out in the book. I still use the book every time I play FF8, but I have also replaced all the wrong information I've found within the book with the correct ones. This book was very helpful, and I liked having the pictures of the game, where I could see if I was doing things correctly. This book would have been better if the editor had payed more attention to his job!"
4,World of Love and Battles on Final Fantasy VIII,"Final Fantasy VIII strategy Guide is the best of the ultimate game of the year, because I think it is really easy to follow instructions and it keep me going played all the times. Also there are best thing i ever played is make me feel like involved in the FFVIII storylines, it is really quite romance and tense. I suggest you all readers, to buy it now @ Amazon.com which is pretty cheap price to play the ultimate game of the year !!"
3,Some Incomplete Information,"I wont totally make this strat guide seem horrible, but i do think that david cassidy did a better job on the ff7 guide. this guide was lacking in many things. i usually got lost at some points becuase he barely told you where to go, and the pictures didnt show much. this guide was pretty much boring. there wasnt much to be known about. maybe it was just the game, i do not know, but somehow this wasnt all that great of a guide. but, please do buy it, its proably the best guide for ff8 out there anyway. Now, onto the good things about this guide, the strategic ways of him telling us how to defeat the bosses were pretty good, giving use the answers for the seeD tests were awesome (>_-) and tips on the card game was great, without that part, id be losing ever card match that i tried. But all in all this was a OKAY guide. FF7 was a lot better, but this will do. (his parasite eve one wasnt great either...)"
4,very good book,"The Final Fantasy VIII Strategy Guide is a very good guide to a very good game. However, it does have a bit of problems. The book reveals the plot a little, and a lot of the stuff you need in the beginning is in the back. I think that David Cassady did a good job."
3,"All the information, poorly organized","There's no way you will read through this book and find yourself less prepared for the game. It's written in an easy style, with a tendency to hide major plot points, and all the information needed to beat the game lies herein.The only problem is, it's all over the place.In the end, my wife and I ended up using a series of Post-it notes and envelopes and several times in the game we both had to consult the book to find out how to continue onwards. Rather frustrating."
3,"Useful, but it had some mistakes","It had some useful information, but some of it was hard to find. I mean, you have to go searching though the book looking for what refines into what to give you the items for the weapons. The beastiary was hard to follow also. On the up side, its walkthough does get you though the game. Buy it if you don't want to just get one off the internet."
1,Absolutely Dreadful!,"Out of all of the strategy guides I've read, this is hands down the worst! The book is organized in such a way as to make it almost impossible to find anything when you need it. The boss strategies were not very enlightening either. I highly reccomend that you either find a walkthrough on the web or find a guide that is not put out by BradyGames."
3,"Decent, yet full of errors, and it isn't organized well","I love the Bestiary, and the items and ability lists, but this guide has a WHOLE LOT of errors. Here are a few examples...1. It states the Oilboyles have 1068 HP. 2. In one area, it says that the Oilboyles are weak against ice, and that they absorb fire. Then, in the next paragraph, it says they are incredibly weak against Fire spells. 3. It says Ultima Weapon has 1068 HP. 4. For the Omega Weapon strategy, it says he is weak against ice, yet he absorbs fire. And in the Bestiary, they state that he absorbs all type of magic.The order is weird too. The maps are in the back of the book, the items should be right next to the Card section, and the Bestiary section has soooo much typos! I suggest finding Gamespot's guide to FF8, instead."
3,"Average guide, at least there are no spoilers.","The layout of the book is alright. It's a definite improvement over the FF7 guide, but it could still use a lot of work. My problem with Brady guides in general is that some of the information is flawed or printed where it shouldn't be (you can devour Rinoa for MaxHP +10???), and there are the normal numerous misspellings and sometimes mislabeled maps, and in this guide, they introduce something new: questionable capitalization. It's still a good guide, but I'd only recommend it to people without internet access. There are more detailed informations available at fan sites."
4,A great FF8 companion,"I found this book to be an improvement on the FF7 book. The directions are easier to follow, and it includes a lot of important information. I would have liked the names of the Cards to be easier to read - dark font on a dark background is too hard to reference for anything - and the beastialityairy was too hard to decipher. But that's a small point when you compare it to the failure to continue with the total coverage in the FF9 book. This book told me what I needed to know about the little things that I missed - the weapons, the GFs, the magazines (not enough room), and locations like the Islands or the Deep Sea Research Center. It was tremendously helpful. Still is."
4,"Unorganized, but factual enough","This guide was very very good in getting me through the game the first time I played it.HOWEVER, when I went back through to collect all the little items that I had missed, I learned quickly how badly the guide leads you to them.I think instead of giving 2-10 boxes of short comments, I think it needs to list them in order.Yes I know that those boxes prevent spoilers, however, they don't aid me at all in finding X item on map Q.Definitely not one of Cassady's best guides, but it helps complete the game to the bare minimum."
4,good,"im glad i was able to play VIII and it's such an amazing game just like IX is too. like the same with it, the guide could have been better but it's still good"
2,You'd be better off with a walkthrough from the web.,"A truly disappointing attempt at a complete guide. This book, in its attempt to protect the casual reader from spoilers has left out the entire last dungeon's walk through and a complete lack of strategy on the boss. This guide leaves the reader/player with more questions than answers and leaves out a fairly critical technique to make the game's summoned monsters more effective (how hard is it to write ""Hold select and hit square?). Wait for the Unofficial guide, or even better: Get a walkthrough for free from the web."
4,This is an amazing book.,I would like to note that this game has every single secret inside it. Every single one. It does this without even mentioning the story once. That is very incredible considering that most RPG gamers out there want to experience the story for themselves. This is one of Brady Games' finest hours.
3,In comparson to ff7 guide,"The book is good, but it could have been alot better. The maps were in a different section, which requires alot of page flipping when your lost. Puting the maps in a different section was a stupid idea. they didn't show the monsters stats on the side, like they did in ff7, which again means alot of page flipping. It's not as apealling as the ff7 stratigy guide was either."
3,... I'd rather go download a walkthru than spend money buyin,"The thing is that this book is not worth the money. I've read it, and it's not half as good as the one I downloaded online. The only reason why it's all thick and stuff is because you get all those monster stats which are actually useless. I'd rather get myself another game with that money (or actually it only can buy me a nice dinner at Earls or something) than spend it on such a walkthrough, when I know I can get a better one for free."
3,Its not a bad guide but its not well written either,"This guide to FF8 isn't a bad one but it was written in beta form ( which means a few months before the releses of the final game)or its was imported(the imported version is eaiser then the English version) either way it was not well thought though.Sometimes in parts of guide things that should be there or you should be able to get aren't even well addressed and often don't make much sense,the writer rushed this guide and it sticks it ulgy head out alot though the guide....I can say that it does help with the point of having a guide(to beat the game)but if you are thinking of buying this one consider something else first before hand for I can't fully give this guide a five star rating....I really shouldn't even give it a 3 but I was able to beat the game with it so..."
3,"Not perfect, but it gets the job done","There were a lot of errors and misprints, but nothing that couldn't be figured out in a few minutes. It was kind of annoying that the maps were in the back and the items list was in the middle. Other than that, it has tons of information and it only took me 2 weeks to beat the game with it."
4,Pretty Good,"I did not actually buy this from amazon. I got it from my brother's friend's cousin. He found it in his freezer wrapped in plastic. Naturally, it was in terrible shape, but nothing a litte tape couldn't fix. The guide itself is pretty good. It tells you everything you need to know, but it is not as detailed as other guides i have bought. There's no ""hand-holding"" in this guide. Oh, and i wish there was a little more artwork in it, but i guess they couldn't fit it. Overall, an excellent guide."
5,Great overall Guide worth buying,In depth guide with all the things you need to know to do everything in the entire game!
2,This tape annoys me,"Okay, so the exercises ARE good. The abs exercises on most of the FIRM tapes that have them ARE good. But I still think it was a mistake ordering this tape for two reasons:1. It's just a collection of routines from other, earlier FIRM tapes, so to me it pretty much seems like a rip-off. Also, get ready for some OLD ones there - from the time when instructors looked like Kate Moss and even guys were wearing pink and orange aerobics clothes. If you ever felt like you didn't quite enjoy looking at such things anymore - well, then you'll find this tape a visual disaster.2. Who is this Tracy guy, for heaven's sake?! All he does is introducing the sets of exercises - half naked and looking as unnatural as a diamond ring on a homeless guy's pinky. He's ridiculous, but he's actually too annoying for me to be able to simply laugh at him.Altogether, this tape was a disappointment and the two stars are strictly for the exercises."
3,So-So,"This is an ""okay"" workout. It's main strength is that it is divided into 5 different workouts of about 10-12 minutes each, so you can do a portion whenever the mood strikes you. As far as effectiveness, I'd have to say it's only average. For real abdominal strengthening and flattening, I'd recommend any of The Method videos, Keli Roberts' ab video, or Rodney Yee's Abs Yoga."
2,"Had the video memorized, but saw little results","I bought this after having my third baby. I did it so often I had the video memorized, but still did not see results. The instructors move quickly through the movements without informing you of propper posture, so its easy to hurt your back. The video is misleading because the hot guy on the cover, the ""guest trainer"", talks for about 30 seconds, then you watch a room full of women exercising. The guy comes back at the end and says, ""That was tough, see you tomorrow."" And that's it. I finally got rid of the video because in the workout room there are some ""artsy"" paintings of topless women on the walls. The pictures are not real graphic, but I didn't like my older boys seeing them. I got way better results using Jillian Michael's ""Ripped in 30"" because it combines cardio, weights, and abs."
4,"No instant results, but benefits nonetheless","This is definitely a good investment at the price--all of the workouts are good and relatively challenging (Day 4 is a killer, but I love it) and short enough to fit into a daily routine. You won't have a six-pack after only a few viewings (that's dependent on diet as well) but you will have a flatter stomach and a trimmer waist after a few weeks. Why not try it?"
4,"Yes, it's a bit dated, but a great work out!","After reading other reviews I decided to try The Firm 5-day abs. I have been using the DVD (part of a DVD set) for 18 days now. Although I didn't SEE results by day 10 I could feel results. By day 15 I started to see results. And for less than 10 minutes each day that is great!I have no idea why Tracy Jame in this. Basically he tells you before each work out to lay down and then they cut to a female instructor who I think does a great job and is very encouraging with out being annoying.Yes, this dvd/vhs is from the 80's and the Casio back ground music and work out attire are very 80's. But the music does a great job of changing pace with the exercise being done, and I'm in my living room in my sweats so I'm not terribly concerned about what the people on the TV are wearing.I would buy this DVD again in a heart beat and with the results I've gotten so far I'll be trying out the other dics in the set soon!"
4,Great Ab workout,This video is really sensational. I've used it over 10 years ago and it is as effective now as it was then.
5,Does what it says it will do!,"This is a great tape for the abs. The wonderful part is that as you increase in ability, the tape grows with you. If doing one segment of 5 day abs get too easy, try doing two segments ... You will see results!I've been using this video for about 6 months now and I'm still not tired of it. 5 different abs work outs is enough to keep me from feeling like I'm doing the same thing over and over every time I work out, but it's also few enough that after going through each workout a couple of times, I can consentrate on doing the workouts and not have to keep looking at the TV to figure out what's going on.It's a great addition for any video work out library."
3,Goes too fast with too little emphasis on proper posture,An overall good workout but NOT for beginners. I thought the video lacks instruction on proper posture which makes it easy to pull your neck and hurt your back. Provides similar intensity to Abs of Steel series but with more movement and variation and less instruction.
2,Outdated and not particularly motivating,"I have been working out for over 10 years and I have owned two of the Firm series. Though this tape does have 5 day workouts for the Abs, I find the exercises themselves to be outdated and not particularly safe for anyone with lower back vulnerability. The majority of the movements do not allow for stabalizing the lower back while doing them. They don't seem to isolate and direct the exercises as efficiently as I have found other video instructors tapes to do. The plus to this tape is the 5 day varied exercises/Firm instructors and a -pre workout demonstration for each series."
5,Clear and broad coverage,"a good set of books. Clear , broad coverage and easy to understand but you may need some background in stochastic calculas / Ito lemma....but these concepts are all explained in the first book. One drawback is that you may find the mathematics are not rigorous enough ....but you can definite follow the suggested book list to deepen your knowledge...highly recommend to someone who need general intro to quant finance."
2,mike,"Wilmott compendium is nothing more but a summary of all the other books that he managed to publish thus far. This, however, is not the problem. The real problem is that his books continue to lack depth and applicability. None of the chapters will help you to solve real problems nor will it give you guidance of how to implement the models (which some few exceptions). If you are looking to buy a real comprehensive compendium on quantitative finance, which is full of state-of-the-arte examples, problems (problems that really count) and explanations go for the new Carol Alexander books on quantitative finance (part I-IV). She has set the industry standards."
2,Missed opportunity,"Too bad that the editors of this collection have featured themselves more prominently than the excellent writers who contributed to this ""anthology"" and aren't even featured. If you glanced at the cover, you'd never know that the book includes such well known writers as Sue Ellen Case, George Chauncey, and John Rechy, whose lucid essay is a highlight of this collection that all too often bogs down in ""queer-theorizing"" jargon, relieved by some excellent vintage photographs, drawings, and reproductions of posters and relevant documents. More of the same editorial attention might have been applied to some of the dense pieces."
5,MR. WELFARE,"I JUST LOVE TO HEAR THESE SAMPLES THEY BOUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES, AND REMINDED ME OF THE GOOD-OLE 70's . ANYONE FROM THAT ERA CAN RECONIZE THE TRUE TALENTS OF THE ARTIST BACK THEN THEY DISPLAYED REAL TALENT NOT HIDING BEHIND A SAMPLING-MACHINE.AN THE MAN WHO WROTE THE SOUNDTRACK NONE OTHER THAN MASTER CURTIS MAYFIELD WAS TRULY A GENIUS. HAVING PICKED THE PERFECT GROUP TO SING THE SONGS. AND IF THE YOUNGER GERNERATION TOOK THE TIME TO LISTEN TO THESE SONGS THEY WOULD REALLY KNOW WHAT JOY TO THE WORLD MEANS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME EXPRESS MYSELF BIG DEBBIE FROM 110ST.& 8TH AVE. IN MANHATTAN N.Y.C."
1,Not so good.,"Hate to say this, but this book promises far more than it can deliver. The book cites a lot of conventional wisdom along with a few specious claims (such as, you can tell someone desires to leave a conversation by the direction his feet are pointing, particularly towards an exit).I couldn't glean very much useful information from the book, because most of it would not stand up to the scrunity of repeated use, different people or various circumstances.I would say, at best, it's a good fluff piece about this topic.A better book is Paul Ekman's ""Telling Lies"". It is based on more sound, consistent, and standardized research and it is better written."
2,Isn't this just common sense?,"I read this book hoping to find telltale ways to spot liars. Call me optimistic. However, what I ended up reading was common sense pointers to find out when someone is under stress. If you want to find out truly what people do when they lie, do not read this book. It only mentions that each person has specific behaviors that they exhibit when lying. The author constantly cites exceptions to what he says and warns people not to make rash judgments. I do not feel that I learned anything new from this book. The main point here is that if you think someone is lying, then dig a little deeper into that subject area to try and uncover the truth. On the upside, the book was easy to read and was not necessarily boring. But I would look elsewhere to find a more concrete book about what people do when telling lies."
4,closer to the truth than other pop psychology books,"Of the four books I read recently about reading people and/or uncovering deception, this is probably the best, mainly because it doesn't fall into the trap of assigning specific behaviors as indicators of certain traits. The author is an expert in interrogation, and it shows-- the book is grounded in solid psychological fact, and is one that is certain to improve the people-reading skills of most readers. He also dispels some myths, such as those promoted by proponents of Neuro-Linguistic Programming. About the only complaint I have is his claim that the book cannot be used by unscrupulous people to deceive others- not all the best actors gravitate toward Broadway or Hollywood. Still, out of the four books I read, this is the one that is most worth your time and money."
4,A good reference book for adult aspies,"Get more than one book on the subject, as many approaches to spotting deception are available via Amazon.com. Buy 3 or more if you can, to get a diversified overview of this rather complex subject."
2,"Disappointing, and that's the truth.","I had high hopes for this book, but I was greatly disappointed by all of it. The style of writing could most definitely have been improved by a competent editor. The content fell far short of what the title promised. I assure you that most people are aware that if somebody is yelling he is probably mad. This is so oversimplified that it's shocking. What makes matters worse is that the author repeats himself over and over again with the same information -- as though we didn't believe him the first time around. Perhaps he is right... I really don't believe that if a person's feet are pointed toward the door he wants to leave. I think he's just standing that way. So we go from the overstatement of the obvious to ludicrous claims that seem kinda-scientific, but aren't.In essence, I came away from this book having learned nothing. I was so mad I could yell, and now my feet are pointed toward the door. Make of that what you will.Bad book. The end."
3,An alternative suggestion,"Dissecting Pinocchio: How to Detect Deception in Business, Life, and LoveI'm the author of Dissecting Pinocchio. If you bought Stan's book (Stan is a friend of mine, incidentally), I believe you'll find Dissecting Pinocchio a worthwhile complement to it.All Stan's books are excellent, if somewhat hard to read at times. I recommend all law enforcement officers attend his outstanding seminars.My approach is somewhat different than Stan's in that I examine a liar's body language body part by body part, giving the observer a ""roadmap"" to detecting deception."
5,BEAUTIFUL VOICE,I LOVE THIS CD . I ALLWAYS LIKED HER VOICE. I LOVED 4 OF THE SONGS ON HERE AND KNEW I HAD TO HAVE IT.
4,Fast paced and interesting...,"This book was fun to read, kept me turning the pages and ended well. Pretty much what I like in a book!"
2,Made in China,"From reading some reviews of other pans in the Doughmakers line, I mistakenly thought this pizza pan was made in USA. I guessed wrong--my bad of course. I would love to see country of origin explicitly included in product descriptions on Amazon. It seemed thick and sturdy though, and I would have kept the pan and used it anyway but it was warped like a (very flat) taco shell, and I couldn't force it back to flat. Fortunately, Amazon's returns process is swift and easy, and that part of this transaction was very satisfactory."
5,First Rate Beethoven Sonatas,"One of my favorite recordings of the Beethoven Cello Sonatas.These artists make a powerful personal statement. Touching and beautiful, I recommend this CD highly."
1,No substantial information,"This book is basically a pamphlet for the Buteyko method and those that teach it. It briefly describes the Buteyko theory behind asthma, a bunch of testimonials, a history of Dr. Buteyko and the practice of his technique, and the goals of the technique. This information is freely available in equal or greater depth on the internet. I don't find testimonials to be terribly convincing. This book does not teach one how to do the Buteyko technique, claiming that it must be done under the close supervision of a properly trained person. As such, this book is worthless."
4,nice lighting,They met all expectations.For who it may concern (Halogen bulbs produce significant amounts of heat under and on top of the bottom shelf of a cabinet that may affect a heat sensitive product).My light look and work great.
5,Love it!!,"Great light. Nice warm light and easy to install. Please note that you need to connect a wire to it (if you don't have on, just cut an extension cord and connect."
4,Spartan Rock and Heart,"Marshall Tucker Band is our Crown Jewel. They tapped a heart most of us figured we lost. What they found was acoustic, sweepy, weepy, and intense. Thier music chimed my soul back to existence. Let them do the same for you. FANtastic!"
3,live songs,"This cd has pretty much most of the songs from ""Kings At Crime"" only recorded live during shows through out the world. There are also songs that were not released. Also there is a DJ added on this. Also I believe Boston Mike and Lou from Subzero are not on this cd. I would recommend listening to the ""Kings At Crime"" cd before this one."
1,These guys suck,"More gangster nonsense from the NYHC scene. Lots of stupid lyrics about how tough they are, when you know darn well the only way these pussies would ever attack you is if they had their whole ""crew"" with them.One on one, they'd run away like pussies. Or maybe just pull a knife or gun on you.Avoid this at all costs."
5,Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory Original Xbox,This game is the most ballin game ever made! I am so glad I bought the collectors edition. I played it on PS2 first but i'm so glad i bought this version. It rocks! A must buy for anybody!
4,Just what I needed,PRO:Perfect termination for a wall plated HDMI cable run. Looks professional.CON:I wish it was available in an off-white. The color is a little too stark. They should match the white and ivory of standard switch plates found in every hardware store across the country.
4,Garmin windshield mount,"I am an avid geocacher and use this with my Garmin GPS. It works great. Just clean your windshield with some windex, moisten the suction cup and attach! It holds my GPS securely and allows me to look at my GPS without interfering with my vision."
3,I'm a little disappointed,"I'm a little disappointed overall. The suction cup evidently sticks only to glass, not to dashboard or other vehicle interior surfaces. When applied to glass, it has a tendency to work itself loose over time. Finally, there's an included adapter to secure the eTrex to the mounting bracket. If you're using it for geocaching, it means that when you remove the eTrex from the bracket to go off-road, you either have to remove the adapter (not difficult, but requires a screwdriver) or the eTrex won't fit into it's case. I expected a little more from Garmin."
4,Great GPS Windshiel mount,"This little mount is great. I was skeptical at first as I haven't had much positive experience with suction cup items sticking solidly to my windshield. The lever action suction cup on this is rock solid. It only fell off my windshield once and that was one day when the outside temperature got over 100 degrees, so I'm sure the car heated up and broke the seal. I like the two screw knobs for ajusting the position of the GPS. They are easy to turn and lock down. This is a great accessory and I would recommend it for anyone how has an Etrex with the City Navigator (or other auto routing)software."
3,it works most of the time.,It sticks well most of the time....not when it is hot...it falls off. Good adjustments for different angles and viewing ability
3,Modifications required... then great product,"The back cover did not fit directly on the back of my eTrex Ledgend HCx because there was not a space cut out of the cover to fit over the part where the microSD card fits in. So I had to take my dremmel tool and carve out part of the back of the newly purchased back battery cover, then I could attach the new back cover with the clip that attaches to the suction cup mount.However, now that I have the back cover fitting on my GPS, it clips on and off the suction cup mount very nicely. And I even bought a handlebar mount for my mountain bike which uses the same clip... so I can easily unclip from my car mount and clip to the bike mount and back again very easily.If you have a microSD under your battery cover, plan to carve out the back cover... then everything works great."
4,good for water sports,"bought this for ocean canoeing. so far it has been great, it sticks firm to the canoe and has not come dislodged yet despite long journeys and getting bashed by seawater. recommend keeping the sucker clean and keep the gps unit tied on using it's wrist strap just in case"
3,Works O.K.,"I think garmin add ons are way to expensive for what you get, but they are designed so you have to buy them in order to use there gps."
2,Car mount,Mount will articulate many different directions for easy of view. I however stopped using this as it would always fall from my windshield when 4wheeling. It would also fall if the temperature increased drastically.
3,Could be better designed,"This windshield bracket sticks well to the window, but it is flimsy. It vibrates too much when the car is in motion. The only way that this can be avoided is to mount it low on the windshield so that the GPS leans against the dash board."
4,Garmin Etrex Windshield Mounting Bracket,"Very strong suction cup provides secure mounting. Quick and easy clip in and release for taking the GPS with you. Product would be better if the pivoting arms were longer and able to swivel sideways. Otherwise, this is a well-designed and quality product."
4,Excellent mounting bracket,"I read the earlier reviews suggesting that this suction-cup bracket was better than the other one they make, and got it based on those suggestions., to use with my Garmin Vista CX gps. It works as well as those recommendations suggested. No problems so far, except that it is a bit wiggly when you are fiddling with the buttons. But if you grab the whole unit while fiddling with the buttons, you can obvously stabilize it.The suction cup has held on to the windshield (which is what I was more worried about). It allows you to position the gps where you want. All and all, it's the way to go."
1,Poor Design,The only thing this mount does well is hold the unit steady. It's overly complicated for newer units. See Garmin designed this thing to work with all etrex series models. For the older Black and white models it would be great they give you this alternate back place and it just snaps in. For the newer models you're suppose to use the screw from your belt clip to secure your unit tothe mount but that screw is too short I had to get a screw from a hardware store but that sucked too because there was no way to take it on or off without a screwdriver I finally got a thumbscrew from an online hardware store cus none of the local stores had on with small enough threads to fit. So now it worrks the way it should with a small modification (1) 4-40 .500 lenght thumb screw and a small lock washer it works great.
4,Works fine with my Etrex Vista HCx,"As a previous review suggested, you need to use the accessory attachment that comes with the Etrex unit and not use the replacement battery cover that comes with the car mount.It mounted my Etrex Vista HCx with no problem.Access to the buttons is not convenient and probably should not be done while driving. Face it, reaching toward your windshield to sequence a 2.2 inch box is not an entirely intelligent move. You really need a larger unit with a touch screen for that purpose. Let your shotgun rider do the button pushing with the unit."
5,IT DOES WORK FOR eTrex Vista CX !!!,Yes it works on eTrex Vista Cx... actually it is not used the battery door replacement on the newer eTrex models. Instead you should have had in your original package a plastic adapter with a silver coin screw that goes into the back of the unit andthen attaches to the mount.That is why this PN is listed under Accessories for Vista CX on Garmin Website.
1,Garmin 010-10361-00,BUYER BEWARE!!! It won't fit ANY eTrex VENTURE or eTrex VISTA UNIT!!!Bought this mount 010-10361-00 based on GARMIN's Accessory link for my Garmin eTrex Venture C unit. Ordered and received quickly for ANTONLINE...(fine job on their part I might add 2 days from order Whoo hoo!)When I opened package it doesn't FIT the eTrex VENTURE.The unit comes with a replacement battery cover with a built in clip to attach to the mount. The eTrex Venture model has an offset in the battery cover that's different that the one provide with this mount. Went to BASS PRO and bought an NPI mount that's alot more sturdy!
1,Invalid Information,"In my opinion the Zippo I recieved is okay but it is in no way what I ordered. When I clicked on the picture and placed my order I assumed I would be getting a chrome Zippo with the heart, diamond, clover, and spade pictures but what I got what a paled metal casing with a little dragon stamp on it. If you go on Amazon and search for Raised Dragon Zippo you'll see what I got. Don't purchase this item, it is in no way what you expect to get"
4,Scanpan Skillet,"A large, high quality skillet with an ergonomic handle that helps when the pan is fully loaded. Could use an opposing handle because of its size. Heats evenly and should last many years."
4,Cute and it Works,This holds your necklaces and lets them be part of the decor. It's simple to get the necklaces on and off.
1,Necklace Holder,I bought this on Thursday and received it on Saturday. I just opened the package today (Monday) and when I touched the necklace holder my fingers turned silver. I think that the seller just sprayed it with a silver color once I placed the order and didn't even give it some time to let the color dry. This can definitely ruin my necklaces and transfer color to my jewelry. I won't recommend to other people to buy it. I think that I will purchase a more expensive necklace holder to get a better quality!
5,Jazz a Juan,"Thank you Sr. Valdes for your profoundly powerful, beautiful, and personally moving performance on that perfect night (July 18,1999) in Juan-Les-Pins."
2,Blue moon,"I think this movie is so popular because there are so few quality lesbian films. This one has some potent, memorable imagery (especially the end scene on the beach), but the dialogue and acting go from good to mediocre to downright atrocious so quickly that it's nearly impossible to make it to the climax at the end. It's a bland movie with a stereotypical love story of a mismatched pair of lovers who struggle and end up together at the end. I am glad I finally saw it though since it's referred to so much.But for better viewing, definitely see ""When Night Falls"", ""Desert Hearts"", ""Fire"", or even ""Bound""."
2,Beyond the film script.................,"I originally rented this video becasue I thought it was a hetereo love story. I had just moved to Alaska from the Oregon coast. The filmming was done in the community where I lived, and,being homesick, really enjoyed the sceneray. I fastforwarded through the story just to see whose home would be used next. Funny thing, I have never met anyone who knew an art film was being filmed on their beach. I watched it a second and third time to see weather, clouds, tide lines, and tidal debris.I agree with the inaneness of the story. Too silly and slow."
1,Disappointing........ *sigh*,"I really was hoping for more in the exploration of women's sexuality. Instead, I was disappointed in the acting, plot, and intent of this movie. The plot was predictable... women gathering for a writer's workshop, and two find an attraction. But the characters were almost cartoonish, broad characterizations with no substance.... the romance writer, the dyke, the one who's husband leaves.... boring!Women's sexuality and lesbianism are such complex subjects and this movie avoided all the issues. Our society is filled with such critical misnomers about same-gender relationships, and this movie does nothing to clear the air. It only adds to the sterotypes, rather than demonstrating a healthy attitude."
3,Flawed but passionate,"Thought the movie had flaws in just about every area but was not lacking in deep passion. If you see it for more than that you may be very disappointed. By the time Noel and Claire share their first kiss, the sexual tension is truly been painful! So their ensuing relationship is a wonderful release. A good first film for the Lesbian lifestyle. But there's been better movies made since.Acting = 1 starStory = 4 starsSince there's no 2.5, I just rounded up."
2,Finula Bellini,"I saw this movie when it was first shown at the L.A. Lesbian/Gay Film Festival, and later on video. While I appreciate the efforts of the filmmaker I find the movie to be trite and unintentionally silly. The acting is okay, but the dialog and character development leave much to be desired. The almost fully clothed sex scene was a riot. The movie is worth renting to see if it appeals enough to you to purchase. I do know other dykes who really enjoyed the film, so you'll have to judge for yourself."
4,Enjoy the Ride,"I am astounded when I read negative reviews. The entertainment industry did not fund this film, and thus, the director, cast and crew made this film on a very limited budget. That, in and of itself, must have presented numerous challenges.One film cannot be all things to all people. However, this film hit the nail on the head regarding the journey of Claire. It is true, that many people were presented in sterotypic fashion, successfully, to act as the ""backdrop"" for the real drama between Claire and Noel.The message of the film was clear. Intimacy versus sex. Big difference. I got the message immediately! One mark of a good film is you keep thinking about the message. Each time I see the film and think about the message, I enjoy the ride. As more view this film, they will too."
3,Avid gay genre collector,"Conn certainly amassed a number of stringent attacks on her efforts in this production. Sadly most have merit, the dialogue lacks cohesion, the characters are frustratingly under developed and the final love scene is reminiscent of low budget porn. But the curious thread, which most positive reviewers have in common, is that they can't pinpoint why this film, despite its obvious flaws, is so compelling. It most likely has to do with Todd and Trumbo, who rise above a lack-lustre script and some appalling supportive acting, to maintain the subtle line of sexual tension between the leading characters. This is achieved not by means of dialogue, but by way of telling glances and loaded eye contact. Claire of the Moon will disappoint those who expect cinema nouveau, but it's merit in exploring the myriad of potential interactions between women, be they gay or straight, can't be summarily dismissed."
3,Cold as Ice,"While not a total failure, Claire of the Moon is a bitter disapointment. The story appears to be built upon two images, one early in the film and literally the last shot before the credits roll. This is fine, except the images are so subtle it took 3 viewings to pick up their importance to the story. But, the major problem is the complete lack of any dialogue promoting raport, warmth or humor between the lead characters. The dialogue reads like a psychology textbook. Production credits are good. Stay to the very end to see a final beach shot."
2,...stilted and awkward...,"In a cinematic work it is common practice for a film maker to carve a plot that forces the viewer to suspend some, if not all, of their belief. Claire of the Moon is such a film. Prior to viewing this feature, I read the novel and herein lies the problem. As a work of fiction, the story is plausible enough and actually quite enjoyable. However, it just doesn't quite make the seamless transition from novel to film that a viewer hopes for. The acting is stilted and awkward and the verbal sparring between the two main characters that was so successful on the written page falls quite flat here. The only saving graces in this otherwise disjointed effort by Nicole Conn are the beautiful cinematography and the incredibly wonderful score by Michael Allen Harrison. Save yourself the aggravation that comes from being disappointed. Read the book instead."
3,One worth watching the first time.,This movie dragged too often at times. The content of the movie was good. The actress that played Noelle was GREAT!!!! Could of had a better Claire.
2,The scenery was great.................,"I've watched this movie three or four, I think four, times and each time it gets more torturous to watch. I try to remember...was I that insipid in my twenties and thirties....was I that boring. God, I hope not. And, the last few scenes always make me laugh when Claire is riding with her jeans on. Doesn't say much for Noel if she can't even get Claire's jeans off. But, how I loved the ocean scenery."
2,BETTER ACTORS REQUIRED,Too much phyco babble. Did not help that the producer volunteered to having sex with the main character while filming was taking place. Too much information and unprofessional conduct does not make a good movie. Should have spent more timeon the set and less time in the bedroom.
2,Claire of the moon,"A little dated. A little stagnant. It's now in my collection, however chances of watching it again are very slim."
2,Claire hook-up,"It was very dumb movie, but the relationship in the last part of the movie was entertaining at most, they finally got together. Did not like how they got together on the beach. Should have hook up in the house somewhere."
1,Worst movie ever!!!,"This movie is terrible. You have to sit through over an hour of boring talking and inane arguing to get to the shockingly sudden unlikely ""romance"" in the last two minutes of the film. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you want something to burn in the fireplace this winter. As a lesbian, I was greatly disappointed."
2,If you like streotype this is the movie for you,"This movie annoyed me. I have no problem with gay woman/straight woman romance. Heck I kind of like them. This movie however was long, drawn out, soaked to the brim with sterotypes, and had way too much talking. The only thing I did like about it, was the dance scene. Heck I watch the movie for the dance seen. Still trying to figure out what the song is called. Other then that the movie was barely watchable and very predictable. Nice bedroom scene at the end though."
5,"Heartfelt, Sensous and Extremely Erotic","This is the best lesbian film I've seen besides Entres Nous. Granted, it has a few budgetary problems, but if you like the build long and slow, this is the film for you. The erotic love scene at the end of the film left me breathless. I was shocked by a lot of the reviews here. I think, perhaps age has something to do with it? As a boomer lesbian I love romance, and Claire of the Moon is ROMANTIC!!...Lush and sensous."
2,HEY GIRL - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This movie is a total waste of money - don't buy it! It's really boring and nothing ""good"" happens until the last 30 minutes of the movie."
2,"Good love scenes, bad dialogue.",Writing sucked. One of the main ideas expressed in this film is the theory that men and women can't truly communicate with each other. Such hogwash.The only thing that redeems this movie is the love scenes between the two women. Truly hot. If only they could have just done love scenes and not talked...Rent before you buy.
1,sleep inducing,"Absolutely awful! I had to force myself to sit through the first 23 minutes and then turned it off, relieved to be rid of the abominable acting, the weak storyline, the succession of cliches... I believe this movie is enough to scare anyone back into the closet or to stop them ever coming out."
5,An absloute winner,"Taxiride have a great album here...full of catchy tunes and heaps of future hits. I bought the album a couple of days ago, and haven't listened to anything else. ""Counting Down the Days"" is a fave of mine, while ""Ice Cream"" sticks in your head all day. It's great to see this Melbourne band have such success all over the world."
4,Summer CD!,"A pleasant summer's worth of tunes...just in time (for me anyway)...put this in rotation and enjoy the ""who's this?"" from your friends...the group is in good company with influences like CSN, Badfinger, and the Raspberries...energy and drive enough to keep you listening with the top down...very good production and mix...4 1/2 Stars"
4,Fantastic CD,"This CD is excellent. True, every song doesn't rock, but each and every song has a great sound and a distinct feel. I highly reccomend that you pick this CD up as soon as possible, seeing as how it's far superior to just about everything else out there. These guys are very talented, even if they do sound a bit too Top 40ish now and then. Why not 5 stars, you ask? Well, for starters, it's only 39 minutes long. There's also room for improvement, as there is with any band. Great job, Taxiride :)"
2,"""Get Set"" for a letdown","I was really psyched about this CD after hearing ""Get Set,"" one of the finest singles in years. None of the other songs on this CD are even half as good as that song. In fact, at times the songs sound like Hanson covers. There's not enough drive on this album -- an element that ""Get Set"" seems eager to establish. I'm not asking for a harder edge -- it's just that the songs never seem to have any destination. I only paid $10 for the disc, so I guess it's not a total loss. It just bums me out that along with such a great song like ""Get Set,"" there's crud that starts out bouncing stupidly with lyrics like ""I, I like ice cream."" Just didn't do it for me."
1,Get Set for a Taxi ride to the dumpsters!,"This cd is so stupid! 'Get Set' prompted me to buy the dumb thing and then i got hit w/ garbagy songs like ""I like Ice-cream""! Who cares? Everybody does. Point is- I was embarressed for anyone to hear that I was listening to this music. It's so amateur it's on the scale w/ hanson. Maybe lower! I will give them credit for 'Get Set',but the rest of the cd was poopy."
4,Nice little item to have around...,"Well, what can really be said about this item... it's a bag clip, and it's white. It's large, designed for bigger bags like full sized potato chip, or cookie bags, it seems quite durable, it looks rather stylish, and it clips things shut to keep them fresh.The way I look at it, if this saves me from having two bags of cookies from going stale, then it'll have paid for itself. It would be nice if it had a magnet on the back though to stick to the fridge or something.Also, the clips are made in China. I don't understand why we can't even build plastic clips in this country anymore, but that's another story."
4,"Great OXO quality, and large, useful size","I use these clips in many ways - to close bags of chips or frozen veggies, to hold recipe books open as I cook, to hold together hair elastics in my bathroom drawer, and to hold the curtains closed in hotel rooms.OXO makes great quality items and these don't disappoint. The larger size works well for big bags or large jobs, unlike the smaller clips. And the heavy duty plastic and sturdy spring means they don't snap apart after a few months."
5,Jonathan Winters,"If you love humor, this gentle man with a thousand faces will thrill and delight you for years to come."
1,What the heck?!,"I am very upset. I ordered this costume in time for Halloween and it came with the wrong mask, the packaging was showing the right mask..... but the mask inside was not even close. It was the scary mask from the scream movie, not exactly what my 5 year old wanted. Ofcourse, there is no time left for me to have the right mask sent here. The outfit part is ok, what you see it what you get, except the head piece is total crap, it's got this crappy little velcro to hold it closed and it doesn't come to a point at the top of his head, maybe if I stuck something in there it would. I ordered a small and it fits him well, it's just a little long, my son is adverage height. Well I guess you get what you pay for..... needless to say I will not order from these people again. Don't waste your money, you'll probably get the wrong item!"
3,Eh?!,"Personally I LOVED Jemina J by Ms. Green. I had this one on my shelf at home and decided it would be nice to read some ""chick lit"". Some parts were BORNING and others were great.I liked Libby. We have all been in her shoes at one time or another in one form or another. Jules seems likes a great best friend. It is not the characters that I have a problem with, it is their reliance on men.I mean ok fine easy for me to talk (I am married to a FAB guy) but come one. There is only so much of the helpess female lead character I can take.If you have nothing else to do, it is not a bad read. I would say grab Jemima J and leave this one be."
4,Easy to relate to!,I really enjoyed this book. From one twenty someting to another you can relate to how Libby is feeling and what she is going through! Jane Green did a great job on this one! I cannot wait to read her next book.
3,OK,"This book was ok, but it wasn't as good as Jemima J! I didn't love the main character so I didn't care what happened to her!"
4,A fun read...to go along with a cute cover!,"Defnitely a chick book - but a fun one if you need something light and easy. What Libby fore sees in her future is not an aspiring writer that is broke but has a lot of charm and good in bed. She meets Nick (the author) and has what is suppose to be a fling. But even though she tries to keep it casual, Nick makes his place in her life and is hard to ignore. Now, Ed - on the other hand is just what she had in mind. Rich, well-known, and liked- but charmer he's not. Maybe there's something here to work with though. So Libby strikes out to see if Ed is Mr. Right while Nick is always in the background - Mr. Maybe? Will it be Ed (Mr. Rich but doesn't ""have it""- in or out of bed) or will it be Nick (Mr. Broke but a charmer)?"
4,I could hardly wait for free time to read this book!,"This was my first Jane Green novel to read, but I plan to run out and buy Jemima J next. Mr. Maybe really held my attention, and I found myself reading into the wee hours of the night to find out what happened next. I could so relate to Libby's designer tastes and looked forward to hearing about her dating excursions. It's a fabulous summer read!"
1,superficial and irritating,I found Libby to be such a self-centered and shallow woman that I couldn't care about whether she'd find happiness with anyone. A much better and much more compelling story can be found in Melissa Bank's Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing.
2,Don't waste your time,"Mr Maybe is a major disappointment and extremely predictable. You would have to develop amnesia not to know how the book will end. You know from the first couple of pages what is in store for you. Plus, I have to agree with another reviewer that her basis for a good relationship appears to be sexual stamina. She barely gives poor Ed a chance and you wonder that Nick wants her back. I enjoyed Jemima J very much and even though it did take a rather bizarre turn in the middle, it was still a good read and the author drew some good characters. This was not the case for this book. The only reason I continued reading it was to see what happened to her friends marriage. This is definitely a library book; don't buy."
5,GREAT READ!,"Mr. Maybe is a great read!! It's simple, funny and a good escape to everyday life. I highly reccommend it! My only gripe is that the back cover tells the entire story. What it says on the back doesn't happen until page 300! I was very disappointed. So, when you read it - don't read the back! Trust the reviews - it's worth your time to read!"
2,Disappointing...spoilers here...,"After reading ""Jemima J."" I was looking forward to ""Mr. Maybe"". Unfortunately, this book is nowhere near as riveting as JJ was for me...none of the characters resonated, and I felt no sympathy for any of them.Mr. Maybe was a VERY predictable read - I had no problem figuring out what was going to happen: that the heroine would end up with the gorgeous hunk in the end; that the rich fiancee would hook up with the TV presenter who admired him; that the girlfriend and her husband would break up...etc. etc.C'mon, Ms. Green, ""Jemima J"" showed us you could do better than THIS. Not even worth a second read IMO."
4,makes you re-evaluate what you a looking for in life....,"This was the first one of Jane Green's books that i have read, and i loved it! although, it was only given 4 stars, it was because there were some things missing in it...but otherwise an excellent read, quick. Makes you realize that money isn't everything, and to just go with the flow of things when it comes down to it....This is a must read!"
3,Funny!,This is the first book of Jane Green's that I have read. I found it hilarious but incredibly shallow. If you are looking for a funny book that is very light hearted this is the book for you!
4,"Funny, witty","This book is funny as hell and all of you haters have no sense of humor. If you want to read a book where the main characer isn't flawed and human, then read something else. But the fact that this character is so ridiculous but somehow endearing makes this a fun read. I'd rather read a story about her over one of Green's perfectly boring characters (IE Callie in ""Promises to Keep"") any day. I like the wit in her earlier books way better than the sappy stuff she's writing now."
1,Mr. Maybe NOT,"I found mr. maybe to be lightweight and insubstantial. While this book had the potential to be a fun read to someone who prefers to read romantic comedy, I think many people will be disappointed in the offerings of this book.Unfortunately, Ms. Green doesn't get much depth in her characters. Libby (the main character she wrote about)- is indistinguishable from one boyfriend to the next, due to the vague definers she gives. One serious problem with this book is that Ms. Green seems to come from a ""shallow"" is funny moral relativist position that doesn't allow her to really get into a serious discussion of what love is and what is humor. Ultimately it's too disappointing.Save your money, I would not even donate this book. It went into the trash can."
4,Lots of fun but still an underachiever,"Jane Green is like a talented pianist who insists on playing nothing but Billy Joel: You appreciate the pleasant tinkling but wish she'd expand her range. ""Mr. Maybe"" stars one of the most blatant ripoffs of Bridget Jones in chick lit, but without some of the charming flaws that rounded out the original character. Libby is cute and flightly and resolutely superficial, even in the midst of a life crisis. But Green still spins a hell of plot, and throws in great little touches like ""playing bouncy castle"" that hint of some real talent. Please, Jane, try something next time worthy of your talent!"
3,USE LIBBY'S APPROACH TO DATING,"Cute novel about a woman named Libby, who is basically confused between two men (Can't we all relate???). The question is should she go after whom she thinks she loves or who people feel she should love.I must say, I gave the novel only 3 stars because I truly feel the plot started to drag 3/4 of the way through the book. It became very predictable.All in all, it was a nice read and I am sure many others would agree.Happy reading!!!!"
5,Totally addictive,I remember reading the first page of Mr Maybe and getting hooked.The book was irresistably splendid! I find myself giggling at Ed's weird antics and being amused with Libby's sense of humour(it was strangely alike like mine!)This book is a must read especially if you love some good old romance :)
2,Utterly Predictable,"I recently read Mr. Maybe and although I was initially intrigued by the story, I became increasing angry at Libby. She was selfish, mean and overall a weak character.. Spoiler * so oh she chose love at the end instead of wealth.. big suprise..Nick got a book deal, Nick told her that he was in love with her..so predictable.. I can't stand her bichy friends, and stupid brother, Olly. I actually felt bad for Ed, having to go out with such a tramp. To sum up the book: No imagination."
4,Thoroughly enjoyed it,"I am somewhat new to Jane Green, this being my fourth novel of hers, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My only thought was that I did not think that the book gave enough detail as to what Libby looked like, although it was alluded to that she was somewhat attractive, I did not get a clear enough picture of her as I read the story. That being said, I loved the humor, the first person narration, and the happy ending. Definitely worth reading."
3,"Funny, light-hearted read","This is a PERFECT summer read ~~ light, fluffy and funny. When I read out excerpts of this book to my boyfriend, he laughed over it. It is such a dishy read!Libby is an aspiring woman who dreams of living in a fancy house, wearing designer duds, lunching at the coolest places in London, wining and dining, hobnobbing with the rich and famous ~~ but in her job as a public relations gal, it doesn't seem likely that her dreams would come true. Till she meets Ed, a successful financial investor ~~ and shows her a glimpse of the enticing world she has always dreamed of. Only to get cold feet as the day to start shopping for an engagement ring nears. Also, she cannot forget Nick, the last boyfriend she had before Ed ~~ the guy who is just perfect for her.This book is hilarious in some takes and a fast read. I highly recommend taking this book to the beach (or a camping trip like I did) and prepare for a fun afternoon enjoying a light-hearted read!!"
2,Bad sex and the city,"I was mildly entertained by the first few pages, but after chapters of her lengthy roundabout thoughts on men, clothes and her dream house, the book began to sound more like a superficial teenager's diary. There's also something about her writing that makes reading this book tedious. It's fun to read about someone's honest inner thoughts, but when they sound like, oh, I don't know, something like this, the reader grows weary, know what I mean? It gets 2 gilded 24 karat stars."
5,"Great Book, I think I Love Nick!!!","what a book!! I was so enthralled with the characters, they were all so sweet and unperfect. There are a couple of steamy scenes, I fell in love with.I appreciate the honestly of this book. England is a great backdrop for this book. A must for chick lit readers looking for a happy story."
2,The woman simply cannot write,"If _Mr. Maybe_ is any indication, I cannot believe that Jane Green's work makes to publication. I was constantly finding myself jarred by errors in basic grammar (most noticeably, using ""I"" when she should have used ""me""; e.g.: ""he decided to come along with my friend and I""). I can hardly believe this book got past the editors. Then there are the problems with the story itself. For some reason, Nick is supposed to fall madly in love with the main character's personality and spunk, but we never see the spunk, or personality. All we see is a shallow, greedy woman who is determined to find a rich man so she can become a ""lady who lunches"". What about this woman is Nick falling in love with? It just doesn't make any sense. I was especially disgusted when she kept the Gucci bag that Ed had given her; she should have at least offered to give it back. If she was supposed to have a personality it was well hidden."
2,Not as good as her other books ...,"I enjoyed 'Bookends' and 'Babyville' but from the start I had a major problem with this book - the heroine, Libby, is such a shallow gold-digger I found it impossible to sympathise with her. Why should we root for her to marry the nice penniless Nick when clearly this is a woman who is cut out to be a trophy wife in a loveless marriage, a shallow mindless bimbo who defines success in life totally as a matter of money and designer labels. (Frankly I'd be happier to see her become the victim of a serial killer :)"
4,GREAT:),"This was a great read. It went by quickly, as I could not put it down, and it leaves you with a great feeling. Looking for a funny, feel-good novel? Read this... or check out ""Jemima J"" by the same author!!! (Even greater!)"
3,Cute and funny,"Though the main charachter, Libby, has a tendancy to be irritating and unstable, this was a cute book, with flashes of painful honesty. Life, love, friendship, and the dating scene are portrayed with the usual Brit chick lit flair of fun and endearing problems. Despite her flaws, one finds one's self rooting for Libby in her harrowing experience with love and the commitment-phobic but beautiful guy vs the RING with the snobbish and bedroom-defunct rich guy. The ending is a tad too tidy, but it is enjoyable."
4,Loved it,I thought this book was terrific. Predictable? Maybe. But all of the antics were entertaining nonetheless!
5,Ab Fab!,"I wasn't sure if I really wanted to read this one after having read Jemima J last year (see my review of that for the scoop) but am I so very very glad I did read Mr. Maybe. What a wonderful book!! Jane Green knows what the singleton life is all about!! I am very happily married now, but I can remember just a few years back when I was single going through the exact same things that Libby was going through. Jane Green captures the single twenty-something life and all that goes along with it perfectly. There is never a dull moment in the book - such an enchanting read."
2,Yawn,"Very mediocre. Heroine is quite deluded, to the point that her plight eventually becomes obnoxious and annoying - not to mention dull. Absolutely no suprises ensued - you could see the plot ""twists"" (and i use that word loosely) coming from a mile away. Displays an incredible lack of imagination - this would NEVER have been published had it not been for Bridget Jones' success."
3,"Mr. Maybe, a British love triangle","Well, Libby sure is one messed up twenty-something who is looking for The One. She finds one guy and changes to love him and then changes to love another. Finally, she figures it all out.An okay written book with an excellent story line and hilarious situations."
5,GREAT AUTHOR,"This was a great read, I have to say that I read this one first before I read her otehr books. I read Mr. Maybe which was excellent to and then she has another book that is out called BABYVILLE that is only available at the moment over in europe. Try ...for that one it is a must read. She has others that are available over there that you just simply cant get over hear. I laughed with this book along with her others. If you like her style read all her other books!"
4,"Predictable, but still fun","This book is everything you want in a chick lit, but the twists and turns are very easy to spot. It stuck a personal chord with me because like Libby, I was once trying to make myself happy in a relationship for all the wrong reasons. I enjoyed comparing her views throughout the situation to those of my own when I was in the same spot. The ending was realistic as opposed to the fairy tale which was comfortable. Great read overall! I am looking forward to more from her."
1,Horrible heroine,"I picked this book up because I enjoyed the author's earlier novel, Jemima J. Unfortunately I found this to be a miserable read that I slogged through simply becuase I always feel the need to finish a book I started. The main character is decidedly unsympathetic, boring, and predictable, and the descriptions of the poor rich bloke that ""loves"" her are nauseating at best. I couldn't find any redeeming qualites in this one, best I can do is to advise everyone to skip it!"
4,Breezy read,"Libby is looking for love, but what is it she really wants?Breezy read for grownups who are looking for a light romance."
4,Great Beach Read,"I liked this book, I couldn't put it down. It's very Bridget Jones like, which I enjoyed. A quick and easy read, perfect to take to the beach or the pool."
3,Not what I expected...,"I loved Jemima J so I decided to read this book as well -I was somewhat disappointed. Mr. Maybe was very predictable and not as funny as I hoped it would be. It's still a fluffy fun book, but It wasn't a must read."
1,Trashy Talk,"Do all the women in England....London talk like truck drivers? Maybe I'm insulting the truck drivers here. I find the ""language"" took away from the book. All the foul language drove me crazy and I wonder if that's what is out there today."
1,Thumbs WAYYYYYYYY Down,What a silly little story. I didn't like it. I like Sophie Kinsella's stuff better. BOO!
4,LOVED IT!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The first few chapters were tough to get through because I was sure I knew how the rest of the book was going to play out, but I was pleasantly surprised by the plot twists. Okay, sure, you know what the sequence of events will ultimately be, but the reasons for the changes were what surprised me.... I know this isn't the most articulate review, but I don't want to give anything away. Read it for yourself, then you'll see what I mean!"
2,"Read ""Jemima J"" Instead","I bought this book not long after reading ""Jemima J"" and had the same expectations--witty, complex characters with a heart-warming plot that draws you in. I eagerly settled down with this book and was disappointed not long after the start. Libby is a very shallow and unidentifiable character and her habit of choosing men based on their salaries is evidence enough of this. The 'bad boy' Libby falls for, Nick, wasn't developed enough for me to desperately want Libby to be with him, and the reasons why the wealthy and predictable Ed is not a great fit for Libby are weak. It's a good read for the beach, but for the same price, you're far better off buying ""Jemima J."""
1,Sorry,"I really didn't like this book, I got half way through and decided I just couldn't keep going. I really enjoyed Bookend and Jemina J but this book just bored me."
2,Yikes,I was looking for a light-hearted good read and came across Mr. Maybe . I almost stopped reading part way because I disliked the main character so much. I finished the book and found it utterly predictable.
4,Great read and funny too!,"I thought this book was great. It was a little predictable, but still very captivating. I could have done with a little less time spent on Ed. And quite frankly, sometimes I wanted to slap Libby for being so blind (or in denial) about her relationship with Ed. It made her seem a little naive/dumb. There was so much humor throughout the book, I was cracking up so many times! Fun and interesting, I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day."
5,mr.maybe by Jane Green,"This is a really great read, I laughed out loud !Jane Green is a great author, if you like a little romance with some great humour then this is the book for you.Im a big fan of Jane Green and would recommed any of her novels."
4,great light fun read,This book was such a great light fun read. Anyone who is going through the trials and tribulations of the dating world will love this! I was laughing out loud at some points. Great beach read.
4,None,easy and fun read! most girls in their mid 20s-early 30s can definitely relate. can't wait to read another on of jane green's entertaining novels.
4,Forget Bridget Jones - hello Libby Mason!,"This book was so much more than I ever expected! It was great fun to read and would make a hilarious movie.Libby Mason is bad at relationships, shallow, and unsure of her desires. She is a chameleon with men as she changes to suit their interests. She is suddenly torn between what her heart is telling her and what her brain is thinking when she meets a powerful, wealthy man. Ed has everything she has ever dreamed of - money, fame, a mansion - and he keeps sending her flowers, gifts and takes her to all the ""IT"" places. On the other hand, her recently ended fling, which still has her reeling, was with Nick - a friend, a guy from the wrong side of town with no job, who likes to go to pubs, and discussing politics.This book is hilarious, thanks largely in part to the relationship between Libby and her best friend Jules, whose conversations had me laughing so hard I cried.A great summer read!"
1,"NO, NO, NO!","I read Jemima J. a few years back and told a friend I ""enjoyed"" the book. Not to long after, she surprised me with another Jane Green book, Mr. Maybe. I'm just glad I didn't spend my own money on it.In one word this book is highly predictable! The author (Jane Green) goes out of her way to emphasize certain aspects of the characters, so much so I found myself asking ""have I read this passage before?"". By repeatedly stressing attitudes and feelings of her characters she kills the plot by making the book predictable. Between the jacket cover and the first two chapters I was right on with the ending."
1,Mr. Maybe...Maybe NOT!,"Jane Green's Mr. Maybe was a huge disappointment. I found it very hard to relate to, or connect with Libby, the main character. The extent of her shallowness and materialism made it hard for me to root for her.There were some rather implausible parts of the book that shot major bullet holes in Ms. Green's plotline. It was so obvious from page one that Libby and Nick would end up together...I didn't even read the synopsis on the back cover! The other parts of the book bored me so that I bloody wished it would end already.I can only hope Ms. Green's next novel is more substantial in character and plot."
2,Poor Kindle Copy,"The books seemed as if it was quickly thrown together, although the author cites several resources. Additionally, the Kindle copy appears as if the pages from the original book were torn out and copied on a dirty photo copier. If you want a little additional background information beyond what was in the newspaper and can purchase the book for cheap, go for it. If you are looking for a thorough, well-written and nicely formated book for the Kindle, I'd take a pass."
3,despicable,How anyone can sit there and shoot your children at point blank range because you hate your ex wife is nuts. He is not human to take the lives of your own flesh and blood. He got what he deserved. That poor woman now has lost both her daughters over a psyco who at one point she thought she loved.
4,A heartwarming tale for children,"My daughter loves this book as it tells a reassuring tale of Christ's love for all of us. My 4 year old is enthralled that the little lost sheep is reunited with it's mother and is back in the safety of home, after wandering away from the others, and it is not lost to her that the shepard that helps the lost sheep in Jesus. Which just warms my heart that such a simple tale has such a big message that my daughter wants read to her over and over again. A real find was that Gund makes a ""ewegenie"" sheep that is identical to the one in the book. That makes it even more enjoyable for both my daughter and myself when it's time to read her favorite story. I highly recommend this simple, easy to read tale for small children. I also predict that even as my daughter outgrows her other books, this one will continue to be a comforting favorite."
4,Luis Bunuel's Robinson Crusoe (1952),"Director Luis Bunuel's version of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe is quite good. It seems fairly consistent with the book. We see Crusoe has a dog to begin with and domesticates a parrot and goats. Much later he rescues Friday from cannibals. Crusoe spends twenty-eight years on the island before returning with a ships captain he rescues. Although we see all those years pass, we are never bored by a mundane existence. The acting, directing, and editing is very well done so that we feel we the audience are part of the adventure and humor. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch Pierce Brosnan in ""Robinson Crusoe"" (2002).CA Luster"
5,A Piece of Sunday Afternoon Sports,"I spent countless hours watching this series with my father and the classic outdoor trips with celebrities and their humor. The only thing I missed on this tape was the opening and closing theme songs that captured the essence of the program and memories of the outdoor adventures. Anyone know if any of the series tapes have the songs? Regardless, it is wonderful to have this priceless show in my collection."
4,Hoping design & qualty was good,"We are very pleased with the quality, fit and print design of this sheet set."
1,Buyers Beware,"With the box you get a whole list of cars, vans and SUVs that work with this gismo, and a longer list of vehicles that are not compatible. Contrary to Amazon's description ""Fits regular trunks to square back SUVs and minivans"" it will not fit standard square backs such as a Honda Pilot 2009. That according to the paper that came with it. Note too, that the directions in the instruction booklet are extremely vague. Unless you're savvy with setups and don't need a detailed manual this may work for you.I could not Google a website or manufacturer's number to get more information on which item WILL fit."
3,Sound is old-not new like today,"I can tell you that I love Jerry Lee and his songs. The only thing I didn't like about this CD is that it sounds old. It sounds like a record being played instead of a CD. It's not clear or crisp like a CD you would buy today, but it does have all of his classics on it."
5,I was worried...,This 4 way is a little smaller that I remembered them as a kid when they were in my dads trunk. But the chrome finish is smooth and very durable. My lug nuts were on really tight I had to stand on a few of them to break them free I'm 220 lbs and it handled the torque with no issues.
4,It is what it is,"As the headline reads - ""it is what it is"". I purchased this to replace the basic lug wrench that comes in most vehicles. With a 4-way, you can get more leverage for loosening lugs. Fortunately, I haven't neede to use it yet but it'll be there when I need it."
1,This is SAE not metric,"Yes, this is advertised as metric but it is really SAE with the closest metric equivalent. There is too much freeplay to use this reliably. If you really want a metric sized wrench, I would recommend that you look elsewhere."
2,Not the Best of Ideas,"Though I can tell that a lot of time was put into the writing of this book, the method really does fall flat. Having clients interpret the cards themselves is not the right idea. If you are going to use this method, you might as well just tell a client to go buy their own deck and a book, and then charge them for that advice! Part of my role as a Tarot reader is to interpret the cards because the client cannot or doesn't want to take time to learn. I've been reading Tarot for over 40 years, and this is about the most ridiculous method I've ever seen.That said, while I disagree with the method, there ARE two excellent things about this book: the section about the different clients IS (as mentioned in another critique) hilarious; and, the outlines and lesson plans for teaching Tarot classes are creative and effective, as well as effective self-learning exercises."
1,"Not recommended, Didn't like the format of the book","I didn't agree with a lot of the suggested solutions to the techniques or examples she has listed about that specific technique mentioned in the book. For example, for technique #12 Shock Value, the author wrote ""If your daughter won't stop telling little lies, tell one of your own and let her see what it feels like"" I felt the book was also not very well written. For example, for each ""Seeing it In Action"" she seemed to focus on 4,8,9, and 12 yrs. olds. For each technique, she tells you why it works, gives a deeper message about that technique & seeing it in action which gave examples about what to do about that specific technique."
3,A little disappointed,I found my self getting board but I listened to it twice because I wanted to give it a fair chance.I've come to the conclusion that it's alright for background music but it won't be a holiday favorite.
1,Ultimate Boxing Fighting Fit Workout Routine,not at all as advertized. you get to watch a gym full of guys working out and that's about it. no instructions.
5,Billy Ray Cyrus - Love His Music and Acting,"Billy Ray Cyrus is a genuine personality - he's not pretentious or arrogant.His music is soothing, fun, serious. I enjoyed the DVD very much."
2,Slow,"Far better than The Procedure, which stars wishy-washy ER doctor Earl Garnet, Death Rounds is still a mostly dull and repetitive read. I knew who the killer was the moment his occupation was disclosed, which was in the first few pages. I kept going just to see if this book got as crazy-stupid as The Procedure.The MRSA/Legionella being spread via psycho killer was interesting. Too bad it's caught up in a repeating-itself-marathon. It was the killing of hospital staff that didn't treat the patients well that brought out the best writing and some true emotion from this author. It's too bad the whole book couldn't have read as well as those parts.Overall, Death Rounds is dead stiff as far as the writing is concerned, but the story that's not bogged down by dithering narration of Dr. Garnet is decent."
4,creepy medical fun,this is the kind of story that i like. peter clement is a good story teller who offers a dark and disturbing book that is fun to read.
5,It arrived fast and in an excellent condition!!!,"I really loved this CD. Enjoyed it while driving from one state to another.It just relaxes you, helps to get peace of mind while driving.Strongly recommend it. You will love it!!!"
2,"A COUPLE OF GEMS,A LOT OF CLUNKERS","WITHOUT ANY QUESTION,ONE OF THE MOST OVERATED ALBUMS THEY EVER DID.IT GETS TWO STARS FOR CONTAINING PAINT IT BLACK,ONE OF THERE BEST EVER,ALONG WITH UNDER MY THUMB AND LADY JANE.BUT THE REST? HIGH AND DRY,THINK,AND STUPID GIRL GREAT MUSIC? DONCHA BOTHER ME HAS TO BE THE WORST SONG THEY RECORDED IN THE SIXTIES,AND THE REST IS JUST PLAIN BAD! GO BUY HOT ROCKS,EVERYTHING YOU WOULD WANT OFF THIS ALBUM IS ON THERE,THIS IS A CASE OF A COUPLE HIGH POINTS AND SOME REAL,REAL,REAL LOW POINTS.THIS IS FOR THE MOST DIEHARD FAN ONLY,AND EVEN THEN?"
2,a MASTERPIECE deserves better treatment!! Overthrow Abkco!!,"I LOVE THIS MUSIC so much, I want to see justice done to it.The Stones' true 60s catalogue is not being well-represented. My vinyl LP sounds better than this CD. This CD was probably mastered almost 20 years ago. And it's not in STEREO! My old album is at least in STEREO. The stereo sound is much clearer and you can hear stuff better. ABKCO needs to get their act together. The Rolling Stones deserve star treatment. The Beach Boys just got their whole 60s catalogue reissued in 2-fer deals with bonus tracks! Let's see you do that Abkco!Well, there's nothing I can say about the music that hasn't already been said. There's nothing today that even come close to this stuff. I would like to see this masterpiece enjoying a full remastering and reissue."
5,The Best of the Pre-Beggars era,"This is the first Stones album with all Jagger/Richards songs. The best song on here is the classic Paint It Black. Brian Jones's sitar here is dark and nasty and Mick's lyrics are just perfect. The funky Under My Thumb is another classic rock radio staple, thanks again to Brian and his use of the marimbas. Don't You Bother Me is a real dark and nasty song. Stupid Girl is a raunchy, sexually charged blues-rock number. The epic 11 minute Going Home ranks as the bands longest ever studio song. It features tons of great lyrics and some awesome guitar weaving between Keith and Brian. This is Jones's best album and his Dulcimer on the great ballads I Am Waiting and Lady Jane is perfect. Through in the great country-rock of High and Dry and you have a masterpiece."
5,"Great album, but get the UK version!","This is a wondering Stones album, and a real turning point for the band...it represents the album where they began to finally write the vast majority of their material. However, a caveat exists with this current CD....it is remastered quite poorly (ignore the big, red banner proclaiming a condition to the contrary), and features the US tracklisting. If you can, to fully enjoy this album, find the UK CD of it which has fourteen tracks and brilliant stereo sound. You won't be disappointed."
3,It's okay.,"It's okay. Not one of the Stones' best albums, usually overrated. It contains some great songs ""Paint it Black"" and ""Under My Thumb"" but has a lot of filler. If you like the Stones of this period, buy the catchier Between the Buttons. It contains less ""Great"" great songs but is a much more sold album. A lot funner too."
3,It's not easy ...,"The band's first album entirely devoted to Jagger/Richards compositions, Aftermath is a five-star classic. Or at least, it would be if we were only talking about the original UK album: 14 tracks and an hour long. On the inferior US version, four tracks have been sheared off and the band's then-current hit Paint It Black dropped in as track one; while the latter might fit with the general tone of Aftermath, I much prefer the UK track listing, which made more sense. The US version's sound is crappier, too. Someone at the record company needs to get their act together. Oh yeah, the music. Well, it's great, obviously. (And no, I'm not going to get into the 'misogyny: do they or don't they?' debate -- we'd be here all night.)"
3,One of their best,"This is a pretty good CD,with standout tracks like Paint it black & Under my thumb.And its easy to see who the most talented Stone really was.Brian Jones.I feel he was shoved aside out of pure jealousy.Imagine what sort of band they would have evolved into had he lived.We would have been spared all that phony country junk anyway.For real country-rock I suggest Mother natures son by the Beatles.When all is said and done this probably ranks at best 4th after Revolver,Pet Sounds and Blonde on Blonde.If you like early Stones this is a great buy."
4,"Ah, those clever sixties","This is great sixties Stones (which to me makes it much more interesting thant 70s Stones.) Particularly good are ""Lady Jane"" and ""I Am Waiting."" I like the use of different instruments throughout, as part of the burst of sixties creativity that was flowering. ""Going Home"" doesn't really do it for me as a jam."
5,Who knew!,"I tended to stay away from the earlier Stones albums and focusing more on their classic 68-71 run, but I picked this one up and it ranks right up there with the best. And the irony of it is, this is one of those record company thrown together albums that were so prevalent in the 60s. Go figure! Nevertheless, its a great mix of covers, live tracks, and original Jaggers-Richards tunes (""The Singer Not The Song"" is a classic)."
2,Blue turns to grey ...,"... A bunch of filler thrown around the band's then hit single Get Off Of My Cloud. Quality control was entirely absent -- Keith Richards confessed at the time that they'd have never got away with releasing such tatt in England. More than half of the album consists of ballads, and pretty dreary ballads at that. Yawn. A pox on it."
2,"A hodge-podge, not really an album (2.5 stars)","After the success of OUT OF OUR HEADS, the Stones (really Abkco) take a step backwards with NOVEMBER'S CHILDREN, which amounts to a cynical packaging of leftover songs and current singles.Again, it's half-cover versions and half Jagger/Richard originals in a package that the Stones themselves dismissed. (The UK version of this album was named OUT OF OUR HEADS -- to make things more confusing.) The saving grace is the inclusion of the then-current single, Get Off My Cloud/As Tears Go By.Otherwise, there's little else to this album. Covers such as She Said Yeah are good, but nothing fantastic, while other Stones originals like Blue Turns To Grey sound like album filler.Wouldn't it have been more sensible to combine the US & UK versions of OUT OF OUR HEADS?"
5,A Personal Favorite,"This cult favorite among Stones ""butcher"" albums has songs from an incredible number of sources including the UK issue of Out of Our Heads, and both UK EPs, Rolling Stones and got LIVE if you want it! The 4th track Look What You've Done appears on no other LP or CD. First performed by Marianne Faithfull in 1964, the Stones version of their own composition As Tears Go By, made it's way on to this album as well as the top-10 US singles chart in December."
1,outdated,"I purchased this book to prepare for the DSST in Foundations of Education. In my opinion, it's not worth the time or money. It's outdated; some of the questions and outlines look like they come from 40 years ago. You may find the sample questions so confusing, ambiguous, and poorly worded that they drive you crazy (then again, the actual test is somewhat like that too). You are much better off sticking to the books listed in the DSST Fact Sheet, particularly the standard, more objective texts, and studying them carefully. This book is of marginal value at best."
5,Get It Before It Disappears From Sale,I watch with extreme sadness as more Erroll Garner CD's disappear from sale on amazon.com and other CD retailers. Columbia Records (Sony) does not even seem too interested in promoted the great music he did for the label back in the 1950s.I get a bad feeling that this DVD wont be around for too much longer.Get it before its gone. I am 20 years old and Erroll Garner is my favourite Jazz artist. It has made me so happy to be able to see him perform live...... on TV at least. It might be in black and white but its very good sound quality. And its good quality black and white. I wish I was not born in the wrong era and could have seen him live and maybe even meet the great man.Erroll Garner is the greatest Jazz Piano player who ever lived. This DVD will bring a tear to your eye.Play it for ever Erroll.......... my dear friend
5,a conversion experience,"Earlier reviews well describe this CD and Erroll's playing but what I would like to add is that I think I first realized there had to be a divine consciousness after watching the second track, 'Dreamy' - for how else could such extraordinary beauty of human creation exist? Even after many watchings I will still cry with this track, or with the version of 'Misty' provided against photographic stills. Erroll doesn't look at his hands as he plays - he doesn't need to; he looks up and around, channelling music from the heavens - a master!"
5,Great way to get Protein,I have a three year old who is a picky eater. Nugo bars are a great way for him to get some protein in his diet. They are a must in our house.
4,Great product for vegetarians,"We got these because we were looking for a vegetarian alternative to the other protein bars out there - this is a great option, and great-tasting too, though it would have been nice to have a stronger peanut butter flavor."
1,not the best flavor of the bunch,I love chocolate and peanut butter together but this did not do it for me. Other flavors are winners with my family though.
3,Pretty Cool Jackal,It looks just like the Halo 2 Jackal. It's pretty durable but can't hold the beam rifle that good. It's cool but I'd get a Halo: Reach Mcfarlane figure instead
5,happydogpotatohead should take another listen.,potatohead doesnt know what he's talking about.this album is sooo much better than most of the earlier blues attempts they did.frankly most blues songs sound the same to me no matter who performs them.this album is no sgt pepper but it has some very cool 60ish tunes.in another land is one of my favorites and of course shes a rainbow has a great sound to it.good job stones.
2,Could have been better,"There are some classic Stones tracks on this album. Even Billy Wyman gets a turn and doesn't do too bad with the trippy In Another Land.But when you look at what else was recorded and released around this dame time period, it's a wonder this didn't turn out better. Here's how TSMR *should* have looked like:Side 1Sing This All TogetherCitadelIn Another Land2000 ManDandelionSide 2She's A RainbowWe Love YouChild of the Moon2000 Light Years From HomeOn With The ShowNow THAT *could* have been hailed as a psychedelic-era milestone."
2,They can not do everything...,"I admit, for a long time I underestimated RS 60's output from Aftermath onward.However, on this album they jump the bandwagon and sound like a drunk cliche. Not only un-Stones like or badly played (which can be excusable if the material is great or if the energy is there) but it's like a 6th generation carbon copy of good trippy music.Hello boys! In abandoning regular rock song structure, please replace it with something more than this. Only she's a rainbow stands the test of time (and is a really fun / great song)"
1,Mac Davis,"I take it back(re..previous review)..I traded this record for Mac Davis' ""One Helluva Woman."""
3,dishonest,"This has got to be the most blatantly dishonest album by the Stones in their prime. It's just too obvious that they were trying to find a new niche for themselves, and it fails as badly as their attempt at joining in with the Woodstock thing at Altamont. Nonetheless, there's some good music: ""Citadel,"" ""2000 Light Years,"" ""She's A Rainbow"" which they probably should have combined with some of the gems they brought out as singles during this time: ""We Love You,"" ""Dandelion,"" etc. and gotten rid of the asinine ""Why Don't We Sing This Song All Together"" (because it's stupid maybe?) ...."
4,Sublime,"Their Satanic Majesties Request is a piece of pyschedlic bliss and is more than welcome change to the Rolling Stones orginal Blues-Rock sound which they switched back to after this release which makes it just as wonderful. The album is great and it not to long nor too short. Unfortunately compared to some of their earlier and even some of their later works such as Aftermath, England's Newest Hitmakes, and Beggar's Banquet, TSMR doesn't quite live up to that level but on its own merit is a great album. Noteworthy songs are In Another Land (which was written and sung by Bill Wyman), She's a Rainbow, 2000 Light Years from Home, Sing This All Together. TSMR its not as overrated nor is it as underrated as some my make it out to be, and its definitely not subpar to Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band. Its a decent album that should have a spot in evey casual stones fans catalouge as it a good listen to and a unique one as its the stones on trip into psycehdelic rock."
4,Merry Christmas,"The funny thing about ALL the reviews, for all the different versions, (probably because nobody has the album anymore, and you can't play a CD at 78) is that at the end of side one, very slowed down, is a verse of ""Merry Christmas"". You have to speed it up to really hear it. Just some of the lost fun of the vinyl albums."
3,Definitely Different,The Rolling Stones take an interesting foray into the world of Psychedelia and for the most part it is indeed very good. What brings this album down is the extended Sings This All Together piece and Gomper. The extended piece would be better if it were considerably shorter and Gomper is nearly completely atonal. The other material works because the songs themselves are filled with catchy hooks galore. Most of the material bears little resemblance to other Stones work except for maybe the guitar riffs in Citadel. The 3D album cover is a treat in itself.
3,"...man, do they sound strung-out...","It's an odd one, no doubt about that. What can you say? Some brilliant stuff (""2000 Man"", ""2000 Light Years From Home"", ""She's A Rainbow""), and some of the other stuff they should never be forgiven for (""in Another land"", the so-called attempts at psychelic jams). So, if you just want the cream from this album, get the 3-disc ""The London Years"". But, if you enjoy buying an actual album, to see where the artist was at that moment, then, by all means, here you go."
5,Best Stones on best format,"This is definitely the Stones' most rewarding listen. Those who make negative comments about sacd, obviously have not heard them on a sacd player and obviously don't care about sound quality. SACDs definitely have a richer sound quality and should be checked out by those who have a discerning ear. As for the album, this seems to be everyone's least favorite. This is the most creative piece of work the Stones ever put together, followed by Between The Buttons. They experimented with psychedelia and succeeded. I'm sure the problem is that this album did not sell as well as others or have big hits and so after this album, and especially after Brian Jone's death they totally sold out! And obviously, that is what the majority of you wanted!"
5,The Most Fun-to-listen-to Stones album,"For once, you get the Stones' sense of humor coming through, not something you expect from the band (except when the band dressed in drag for the ""Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby.."" photo sessions.) But then this whole album is quite a departure from the usual Stones blues-riffing. Great tracks such as ""She's A Rainbow"" (#25 Billboard), which wasn't even released as a single in the UK, and ""2000 Light Years From Home"" alone would make this LP worthwhile, but the rest of it is just as delightful. It's a shame, really, that the band was so preoccupied with drug arrests at the time. There was no video for ""She's A Rainbow"", but I can imagine them sipping tea, in Victorian costumes, complete with powdered wigs, and Jagger lipsyncing to it. Would have made a fantastic promo film."
3,Give it a Chance,"I've listened to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band. Their Satanic Majesties Request isn't like it. The only real similarities are in the album covers (look! odd costumes! goofy backdrop! must be the same thing!). Sgt. Pepper's is meant to be a career album, and it is: everyone and their dog likes it (Though personally I prefer Revolver or Let it Be). Their Satanic Majesties is just the Stones doing something different, playing with psychedelia. And the shocking thing is, the album as a whole works. It's exploratory, yet never plunges into the mindless psychedelic chaos of say, ""Revolution 9"" (a.k.a. John and Yoko Drop Acid). Take it apart, however, and very few of the songs can stand on their own. But if you want to lower the lights, and have a quiet drink or smoke with some friends, this will do the trick nicely."
2,"HEY,THEY HAVE DONE A LOT WORSE!","TO BEGIN WITH, ANYONE WHO DENIES THAT THIS WAS A TAKEOFF OF SARGEANT PEPPER BY THE BEATLES, TAKE YOUR BLINDERS OFF. EVEN WHEN THIS WAS RELEASED ON WAX IN 67,THE NUANCE SLEEVE THE DISC CAME IN(FOR ALL THOSE BORN AFTER 1970,BEFORE CD'S THERE WERE RECORDS)WAS A BLATENT COPY OF THE SAME SLEEVE PEPPER CAME IN.(THAT'S OK THOUGH,PEPPER WAS THE ALBUM THAT EVERYBODY TRIED TO COPY,AND THE STONES WERE NO EXEPTION)ANYWAY,THAT BEING SAID,YES, MOST OF THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY HORRIBLE,BUT THERE ARE SOME DECENT TRACTS AMONG THE RUBBLE,LIKE SHE'S A RAINBOW,LIGHT YEARS,AND THE LANTERN IS OK. SOME IS A NIGHTMARE! MOST IS JUST PRETTY BAD,PERIOD!"
2,This is STRANGE,This is so far the worst of the SACD remasters I've heard. In fact the snoring in the middle of the CD actually woke me up. What was this supposed to achieve? Is it an attempt to copy Magical Mystery Tour? The covers are similar but thats were it ends. I like the stones but this shows that they really were musical midgets compared to the beatles.The best track on this is shes a rainbow and the rest is a muddled mess.For music it gets 40% and recording 75%.
2,Sgt Pepper Light,"Its been said before and Ill say it again to reiterate the point. TSMR is a blatant and very poor attempt to duplicate Sgt Pepper. Although I applaud the stones for doing this kind of music.The stones were at their best when they did poppy psycadelic tunes and forgot the usual R&B nonsense.And after all it was the summer of love and the stones had to fit in.Im just disappointed they didnt continue with this kind of progression.Some of the songs are quite cool & cute,kinda like Sgt Pepper. Such as 2000 light years & lantern are great pop songs.If you like the Beatles & Floyd give this a go,its definately their best work.LONG LIVE THE HIPPIES AND THE SUMMER OF LOVE."
3,What Were They Thinking?,"If this was the Stones answer to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper, then they failed miserably. A few excellent songs. 2000 Light Years From Home, She's Like a Rainbow, 2000 Man...and the suprise of the album, Bill Wyman's ""In Another Land."" Even stoned I can't get into it. As for the Sgt. Pepper comparison...Brian Wilson's ""Smile"" is 2000 light years ahead of both groups!"
2,The Tripping Stones,"The album titled 'Their Satanic Majesties Request,' just shows that the Rolling Stones are an opportunistic band. Here the Rolling Stones dabble in psychedelia and it seems like tripping was the main insparation for this album. Personaly, I prefer the stones drunk and high on cocaine/heroin. That way you get great albums like Sticky Fingers! I did not particulalry enjoy listening to this alum, but I wonder if I would of enjoyed it on a different state of mind."
2,The Worst!,"I never liked Their Satanic Makesties Request by the Rolling Stones, the whole album was just thrown together poorly. The band actually never where in the studio together for this one. This was all done by Mick Jagger, the way this worked was each band member recorded their part and left it for mick to do the mixing and arrangment. Besides the fact I never liked this album to be honest. Around the same period of time the beatles had just came out with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band so the rolling stones had to do something very similar. For instance look at the record covers it looks very similar to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover. This was my least favorite Rolling Stones album. Not Recomended!!!!!"
2,Giving L-O-V-E a Bad Name,"Wow. This is a really bad album (although ""2000 Man"" rips, but I digress). The thing I always dug about the Stones was how they held their own with the Beatles -- album for album, single for single -- up throuigh '66 or so. And then came this campy mistake in which the boys decided to imitate the Fabs rather than compete with them. Didn't work. They should've consulted with Brian Wilson and saved themselves the heartache -- but I understand he wasn't ""available"" at the time...."
4,Good,"I'd heard so much bad about this album, that I didn't bother listening to it for years (even though I'm a Stones freak). Then a radio station played it one night, and I was amazed how much I liked it. There is really a lot of great stuff on it. True, the extended ""Revolution # 9"" type sound mess is something to skip past every time. But most of the other songs are quite solid. Even Bill Wyman's song ain't bad (though it's not great). Mick, when asked in more than one interview since, what he thought of this lousy album, said, ""Well, actually, I quite like it, because it was different. In fact I wouldn't mind doing something like that again."""
3,This Record Should Be Played Loud,"Not just a collection of tunes (whether good or bad), TSMR is an ""album"". A forgotten gem amid the high quality Stones catalog.There is more to this album than ""2000 Light Years..."" and ""She's A Rainbow"". What about ""The Lantern"" and ""2000 Man""!? You can actually hear on Beggar's Banquet some influences from ""2000 Man"". It's got a classic tempo (beat? rhythm?), and Kiss also did a remake of the song to boot.""The Lantern"", like ""In Another Land"" is dreamy, druggy and a subtly catchy tune with repeated listens. And ""Citadel"" is a classic Stones Riff-horse in a flower-power disguise.Overall, is it ""Exile On Main Street""? No. But it's not as disappointing as ""Dirty Work"" either. It is a great album to put on and play at home as it all seems to tie together in a weird sort of cacaphonic way. Better than most ""psychedelia-flavored"" corporate pop of the '67-'68 season."
4,AN UNDERRATED PSYCHEDELIC HEAD TRIP,"This is definitely an underrated album. The first time I heard it, I didn't like it, but that was because I didn't understand it. At first glance it may appear to be a pretentious cash-in on contemporary trends, but THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES is actually somewhat of a parody of psychedelic silliness. ""In Another Land,"" the key to understanding the album, functions both as the quintessential psychedelic tune and as a poke at the dreamy absurdity of most of the genre. Also interesting is the fact that the Stones ventured farther East for their exotic sounds. Much of the experience seems to be lifted out of some tropical jungle inhabited by pagan savages. Check it out."
4,where to go from here?,"In exploring psychedelicised rock, Their Satanic Majesties Request is quite essential, as has been shown by many reviews below. But in exploring very peculiar albums (this certainly is one) the follow-up is always problematic for interested listeners. Therefore, anyone who knows Their Satanic Majesties already and likes it: try Primal Scream's Vanishing Point - it starts off as a 90s version of this odd Stones album."
3,Transaction,Transaction was great. No problems whatsoever. This is not one of the Stones stronger albums but I lacked it in my collection.
4,Stones satanic majesty,"Bought this from memory and was a bit dissapointed at first, thinking that the memory does play tricks. But once I put it on my MP3, with the shuffle turned on, and listened to one track at a time, I was happy with my purchase."
3,Sgt pepper for the musically ignorant,"Ok,time for a little re-evaluation.Ive upgraded from 2 to 3 stars,after all any album that blatantly copies the Beatles work of pure musical genius(ie Seargent Pepper)is worthy of serious consideration.And lets face facts this album is a direct poor mans rip off of Pepper whether you like it or not,and while most of the Stones work was pedestrian at best,this pseudo-psychadelic work is where they peak.Though this is generally awful stuff,it represents the best of the Stones,and overall I highly recommend Sgt Pepper. To the previous reviewer in regards to the White album,ALL REAL Beatles fans love it uniformly."
2,"with this, jagger became a joke","this is neither an underrated psychedelic masterpiece nor the worst thing the stones did. but good god awmighty its pretty boring...citadel is a great song (done better by redd kross btw), and shes a rainbow and 2000 light years are keepers. the rest can be burned with the rest of the 60's trash. gomper perfectly illustrates keith's opinion ""half the record was us trying to make a good record, the other half was 'lets give the people what they want and go home'"". this release reeks of mick jagger. his poncing about on between the buttons is okay because the songs are good, and he recovered some of his ""aftermath"" attitude for a few albums afterward, but hearing him on this makes it clear that he is an ""artist"" first (and i use that only in the most condesceding way possible) and a rock & roller second...."
1,How do I give this 0 stars?,"This Rolling Stones album was put out as an answer to St. Pepper's by the Beatles. Keith Richards of the Stones said it was a horrible album. I have to agree with his opinion. It was clear that the Stones had *no clue* what they were doing when they made this album. In short, it's a mess! I bought it out of curiosity, and it was a huge mistake."
3,It's so very lonely,"This album is the Rolling Stones ""answer"" toSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. This was the first Stones album not produced their manager, Andrew Loog Oldham. Given the freedom to produce the album themselves, they went overboard with ""experimentation"". In addition to the gimmicky ""psychedelic"" sounds, the songs they wrote are weaker than usual. But there are a couple of great songs here, that being ""She's a Rainbow"" and ""2000 Light Years From Home"". My third favorite song here is, surprisingly, the Bill Wyman penned and sung ""In Another Land"". The rest of the songs range from bad to mediocre. The worst is the interminable instrumental version of ""Sing This All Together"", which goes on and on and on. But the album does have it's moments, and some people seem to like it more than I do."
4,"Slight musical misstep, but super sound","There are some great songs (""2000 Light Years from Home"", ""In Another Land"") among the psychedelic murk in the Stones' answer to the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper"". There are also a few, let's say, undistiguished numbers the Stones would probably just as soon forget. This new remastered edition delivers on the promise of spectacular sound, even with all the layers of spacey production, that makes this album an enjoyable listen even in its weaker moments."
3,I thought it was funny,"In an alternate Universe, the album ""Sgt. Pepper"" was actually done by the Banana Splits.If you want to know what that album sounded like, buy Their Satanic Majesties Request"
2,Skippable,"The only things worth having on this album are ""She's A Rainbow"", ""2000 Light Years from Home"", and ""Sing This Song All Together."" You can get two of those, plus the very good single ""Dandelion"" on Thru the Past, Darkly."
1,I really miss the beatles..,"This is no 'response' to sgt. peppers. it is a blatant rip off. the stones have always been unoriginal hangers-on, making a career ripping other people off. how the beatles ever tolerated these posers hanging around is beyond me. you think the stones proved their originality by continuing to make innovative music after the beatles broke up? tell me your favorite stones song or record - I doubt it's anything after 1970. wait a second... what exactly has this band done since 1970?..."
3,This Is No Stones Album!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the Rolling Stones weakest albums from their 63-73 heyday. The Stones never embraced psychedelia successfully (with the exception of Paint It Black) and this album is valid evidence. There are a few excellent songs on the album though. In Another Land, 2000 Man, 2000 Light Years From Home, and Citadel are all great psychedelic songs that must be heard. Shes A Rainbow is a little light weight and airy fairy though. The rest of the tunes such as On With The Show, Gomper, and Sing This All Together are miserable, failed experiments (they are actually pathetic). The Stones were trying to compete with The Beatles, The Kinks, The Small Faces, and current pop trends. This band was always more successful when they stuck to the blues, hard rock, folk, and country roots as Beggars Banguet proved. This album is worth owning but was basically a stab in the dark."
1,Not recommended,"I consider myself a loyal Stones fan - I've been buying their records since I was a young teenager in the '70's. However, unless you're an obsessive who must own every Rolling Stones album, I would advise against this one. Most of the tracks are unlistenable, pseudo-pschaedelic nonsense that you will never listen to after the first play. One song stands out - ""she's a rainbow,"" but if you're buying this just for that one track, buy Hot Rocks II instead and get a decent hits album for your money."
3,Cosmic Christmas,"Satanic Majesties would never be in anyone's Stones Top Ten -- or even Top 30 -- but it's oddly endearing. Fuzz, love and flowers didn't exactly suit the band, but that's half its charm: it's fun to see the Stones experiment. Interestingly enough, one of the album's defining influences is the music of Morocco -- there's an intriguing Arabic buzz to much of the record (and to its contemporary single, We Love You). Citadel might have been a Stones classic if it had been recorded in simpler form for, say, Aftermath; Gomper is beautifully baroque (despite the ridiculous title; its working title was The Lady And The Lake, which makes more sense). And 2000 Light Years From Home is a blast, pure and simple. It's no Sgt Pepper, or The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn -- or even The Doughnut In Granny's Greenhouse -- but the Stones would make much, much worse records in the years to come than this failed but noble experiment."
2,"A mess,but they have done a lot worse","Although this is a big mess (the stones response to the beatles epic sergeant pepper),there are at least a few redeeming moments,which is more then I can say for anything they have done for about the last 30 years!!! So,if you feel you need this,and the price is right,go ahead,just don't expect much."
4,A merry-mad carousel going around into oblivion...,"Difficult to assimilate even after a few plays, ""Satantic Majesties"" is still a colorful, lazy-chaotic mess with blissfully stoned moments of sad, fake-merriment. ""Citadel"" is a tough, jangling rocker, ""In Another Land"" is almost a ballad(and a beautiful one)with psychedelic flourishes, ""2000 Man"" is a great stone-out, and ""On With The Show"" is an amusing musical swipe at the Beatles. The opener, ""Sing This All Together"", is a kicky pop-wannabe, but the jam session reprise is an obvious time-filler. Thankfully, ""She's a Rainbow"" saves the second volley, and is a majestic pop masterwork. Nothing else on ""Majesties"" is quite as captivating or as memorable as ""Rainbow"", but the opening songs are well worth hearing and feature some incredible orchestration."
3,Not Their Worst,"TSMR, although panned heavily by critics, is not a bad album. TSMR was released during the psychedelic onslaught of albums soon after the Beatles Srgt Pepper was released. The Stones were simply caught up in times. I disagree that the album completely rips off Srgt Pepper. The album is uniquely a Stones one. I would rate it 31/2 stars if I could.Highlights are ""She's a Rainbow"" and ""2000 Light Years from Home"". The former has wonderful string arrangements by John Paul Jones (pre Led Zeppelin). The latter has a trippy feel due to the use of the Mellotron, a precursor to the synthesizer. Songs to skip are ""Gomper"", and Sing this Song (See What Happens). Both are boring overlong psychedelic hodgepodge. There is some great guitar work in ""Citadel"". The Stones, however,wisely went back to their rock'n'roll roots with their follow-up album, ""Beggar's Banquet""."
5,Satanic?,"While the term ""satanic"" may be a bit rash, the Stones dish out a square meal with their most psychadelic work to date. By some considered to be a ""response"" to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Their Satanic Majesties' Request stands alone as a watermark for 1967."
4,Not Bad Considering They Were Police Targets,"Something everyone seems to forget when comparing the patchiness of Satanic to the brilliance of Sgt. Pepper was that the Stones of '67 were under a year-long ordeal of police harassment after Brian Jones (mistaken for Mick) admitted to a reporter that he used LSD. The cops swept in on a party in Feb. '67 (waiting til George Harrison had left), and so began numerous trials, days in jail, nothing the Beatles with their cuddly public image ever had to face.That the tracks here hold together as well as they do - ""She's A Rainbow"" and ""2000 Light Years"" as powerful as anything on Pepper, ""2000 Man,"" ""Citadel,"" and ""The Lantern"" having their own folky and rock charms-is a testament to a band's endurance, and probably why they outlasted the sixties. Had McCartney, or particularly Lennon, been busted as many times for their copious drug use that year, Pepper probably wouldn't have sounded half as good as it did."
3,Beautiful Rubbish,"Marc A. Vesci has no idea what he's talking about. Jagger admitted that this album was the stones attempt to combat Sgt. Peppers, he also admitted that they failed, and were taking too much acid anyway.Having said that, I find amazing beauty all through this album, from the delicate She's a Rainbow to the mysterious 2000 Light Years and the plain groovy Citadel, this is well worth a listen, if only as a messy yet Nostalgic piece of psychadelia."
1,soccer dog -awful,Quite honestly one of the worst films i have ever seenDont know if its a comedy the only funny thing is that its set in 'Scotland'
5,Definitively a MUST READ!,"As always Roy Williams doesn't cease to impress with his wisdom. It was an amazing experience to devour chapter after chapter of invaluable advice for every situation: from advertising to life, from branding to ChaosTheory, from Canadians to El Comendador!If one REALLY wants to learn what persuasion is all about and how to masterfully use it, this book is a must read and re-read."
1,Magical Thinking,"As a graduate of the ""Wizard Academy"", I can vouch for Roy Williams: he is a masterful, charismatic speaker. The dark side, though, is that Roy respects scholarship only slightly more than he respects his followers. Roy talks about brain chemistry, but has no training in medicine or psychology. He talks about quantum physics, but never graduated college. His method of self-teaching is the purchasing of many volumes that he skims in search of support (however tenuous) for conclusions he's already arrived at.Roy is charismatic, yes, but then so are most con artists. What he preaches is pure bunk, overlaid with a good deal of pseudo-sophistication and ""mysticism""! Oooh! On the other hand, if this is your cup of tea, Roy pours it better than most."
5,Worth 5 hilight markers,"Honest, I went through 5 hilight markers marking up this book with sentences and ideas for my own line of work. I ordered more copies for my associates and friends. The Wizard is not just for marketing geeks but for all who want a great perspective on life."
1,"Seems like a nice guy, but this book was mostly useless","If you're looking for marketing advice, this isn't the book you should buy. I was looking for advertising strategies and felt I was getting moral lessons in life and being preached at instead. I don't need the Wizard's guide to living a fulfilling life, I just want advertising strategy.I bought another of his books and it was the same deal. It says it's about how to write well, but 75% of it was photos with poems people had submitted to him, which had nothing to do with advertising.If he wants to market himself a little better, perhaps his books should actually talk about advertising, not why I should be pursuing my dreams and acheiving my spiritual potential and stuff.Not recommended."
1,Another SELF PUBLISHED &#65533;Best Seller&#65533; by the Wizard!,"Welcome all, to limited vistas and monochrome sunsets, written by a man who boast of being a best selling author. The Wizard peddles his SELF PUBLISHED ""Best Sellers"" to all the small thinkers who dare to venture into ""intellectual smallsville"" with him.You are a SMALL THINKER right? Isn't that why you're here? In search of a special genie to help make things right?The glowing reviews you see here, are from followers who can't seem to conjugate a verb or understand the relationship between the subject and the predicate. Wizard readers are the unwashed masses, the social promotions, the GED graduates,[fools] who willingly call themselves his followers.The Wizard caters directly to those who are challenged by simplicity and in search of a magic solution.Go ahead, dive into the shallow end with the wizard.Hope you don't bump your head."
1,disjointed,This was edited with a shovel. I have no idea of what this jumble of pictures and words pretends to be. It's like the last of the old hippy acid trip books.
5,nuggets,"I am happy to have received this copy of uncollected stories. The book conditon was better than expected and the delivery was fast. I have read most of what Faulkner has written and even though he can be hard to follow, he still is a great author. These stories are good but not his greatest work. I would still recommend this book to readers who want to get a taste of Faulkner's writing skills before beginning to read his novels."
5,THE EDITION OF THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT,FAULKNER IS ALWAYS FACINATING.-I LOVE HIM.....I'M READING THE COLLECTED STORIES AND THE RICHNESS OF THE BOOK AWAKE MY INTEREST IN OTHERS BY THE SAME WRITER.-
1,BOOK NOT RECEIVED YET,"AMAZON.COM,PLEASE NOTE:I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS BOOK YET. I AM STILL WAITING FOR ITS ARRIVAL.WHAT IS WRONG?PLEASE CHECK ON THIS ORDER.GLENDA THOMPSON"
3,Uncollected Stories of William FAulkner,"I was disappointed in this book, mainly because I have read all of the books whose section were writted in it. I preferred Faulknes's Uncollected Stories."
3,Something Done Well,"John Updike famously said, ""Ted Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill."" That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. The banter between the characters is something that can be savored. For example, Suit tells Jesse he has Paradise Donuts under constant surveillance because donuts certify his ""copliness"". What Jesse says about himself could apply to the dialogue generally, ""It's hard for me not to be cute."""
5,Mystery Adventure,This is the 5th TV movie in a series of 8 staring Tom Selleck who plays Jesse Stone.Suggest you watch the first 4 which are Night Passage-Stone Cold-Death in Paradise-Sea ChangeThen; Thin Ice----No Remorse---Innocents Lost and the last one so far!!! ---Benefit of Doubt.The next TV movie should be out in 2013!!Robert Parker is a very good Western and Mystery Writer.
4,Jessie Stone,"I have been reading Parker for 18 years. All of his characters have something in common, integrity. The novels change in complexity and depth. This is an easy read that continues an interesting man with a troubled past. He makes progress here. Something stops, the circular motion of his life. That is why I like this book."
5,Great!,"This is a great movie that really brings out the characters from the book! Very enjoyable, leaves you wanting to watch the next one! Great acting by all involved. I would defnitely recommend this movie to any Tom Selleck fans. He does an awesome job at playing the lead role!"
4,Good pick.,"Good story, but slow moving. It was a good enough story to make me go back and buy the rest of the Jesse Stone series."
5,Very good,"Like the other Jesse Stone movies, this one has two stories going at once. On one side is a missing baby (Baby Blue), and on the other is a gunman who shot the state's homicide detective. Selleck is consistently believable and excellent in this series. If you haven't tried it, start at the beginning."
4,Jesse Stone: Thin Ice,"I like Tom Selleck and he fits the part of the aging Jesse Stone very well. Although he is going through many personal problems, divorce, alcohol and his attitude, throughout this series, he manages to keep Paradise City abit off balance while performing his duties. I look forward to more movies in this series."
4,Not Quite As Good As The First 3,"My husband and I are fans of the Jesse Stone series. This one was a bit weaker than the first three, but we still enjoyed it. I can't put my finger on exactly why; maybe the dialogue wasn't quite as sharp. But still much better than most of the tripe available out there these days, with actual well-developed characters and a plot to follow. I hope they decide to film the final one Parker finished before he died. We'll be waiting."
2,Thin Ice,"I had missed this movie twice,and wanted to view it. I found it OK, most of his other films in this series were better."
3,Thin Ice,this film differed from the previous Jesse Stone films which were based on Robert B. Parker's novels about this character. The previous films were based on strong Parker plots that were modified for film. This particular film was not and has suffered from the much poorer writing and a less coherent plot. Since I do enjoy Tom Selleck's work I would hope in the future He would more closely adhere to the original Parker plots.
3,A nice little documentary,"This DVD is a nice little documentary - but that's about it. I watched it and stored it away, and I probably will not watch it again. Not that it is bad, but it's nothing 'out of this world' either, watching Paul talking about Paul and about his work on Flaming Pie. The highlight is definitely 'Beautiful Night' at the end of this documentary - probably one of Paul's best solo songs ever. If you are a huge McCartney fan, go ahead and get this one - otherwise, I recommend the 'Live at the Cavern Club' DVD which shows him doing what he does best: Being one of the greatest musicians this planet has ever seen...."
5,Interesting insight of a legend making a classic CD,"For the McCartney/Beatle fan this is a very interesting insight of legend Sir Paul McCartney making the classic album/CD ""Flaming Pie"". One also gets to see the serious side of Paul as well as the easy-going side of him."
3,Very interesting behind the scenes making of music.,This dvd mirrors the making of McCartney's Flaming Pie cd. The high points surround the film taken in the studio. Appearances from Ringo Starr and Sir George Martin add to the magic.
4,for the love of paul,INTERRESTING DOCUMENTARY BUT IT IS PITY THAT THE DVD WAS NOT SUBTITLE IN FRENCH LIKE THE FRENCH TV VERSION !
1,A Shocker,The thing with Paul is that he gives nothing away. There is nothing new in this doco. It is just egomaniac Paul going on and on about what a suberb bloke he is. There are some very embarrassing moments in this. Definitly one I wouldn't play to my mates!
4,W.E.B. Griffin couldn't have done better!,"Large cast of well developed, interesting characters set in the early days of WWII. A military family has several military observers in four corners of the globe.Almost impossible to put down, and I am usually a harsh critic of fiction. I'f Griffin and Clancy readers had found out about this guy, these books wouldn't be out of print now."
5,Greatest American playwright of all time.,"I love these collections of Williams plays. I have both volumes and they include all his plays. Still small enough to carry around as the pages are very thin but this is not in anyway bothersome. His writing has changed my life. Such compassion and understanding of human need and pain. I never tire of reading his works. Williams writing is a must for anyone, even if you are not in the theatre world. His plays are timeless and genius. He is the such a beautiful, poetic playwright."
4,Lonely man who connects with a lost bird,"Lyman works nights, driving around and around the Loop that circles Ft. Worth, assisting drivers with stalled cars, removing suitcases and furniture and other things fallen from a moving car, burying dead animals that wandered into the path of cars.As a hobby, he takes college classes, classes of a practical nature, delving into languages, and discovering how to repair plumbing, and learning first aid.Then a parrot flies into his trailer and, with the help of an equally flawed college librarian, Lyman sets off in search of the bird's owner. Or, as we soon discover, the bird's many, many previous owners.I loved this little story of a lonely man who connects with a lost bird and a loopy librarian."
5,Great book,I highly recommend this book. I couldn't put it down and am still thinking about it. This is a story that will stick with you.
4,I'm an Eagle!,"Coomer manages to touch on a variety of deep themes - and does so in a natural way, taking us with a childs earnestness toward the difficult realization that meaning is likely not as available as we'd wish, not exactly as we'd wish, but that it's OK. Pretty decent for modern fiction"
3,Advanced Business Arabic,"This book is very useful, but although it is ADVANCED, it could be better if there were English transliterations for the texts."
5,Fractured Flickers - The Complete Collection...,"Initial review:I bought this strictly for one skit - Hymie und(/and?) me!It was hilarious when I first saw this 60's television show back in the 70's (of course it was a repeat). When I get through the rest of the collection, I'll update my review!Five stars for Hymie and me - alone!Stay tuned..."
5,MEMORIES !,"I wanted to show some of my ""OLD COMEDY SHOWS"" to my youngest son.It was definitely a good choice.As good and funny as I remembered.THANKS FOR FOR MEMORIES,LARRY I."
4,Fracktured Fun -Filled,"I remembered this show from when I was a kid, one of several early, mid-60`s lookbacks at the 20s-30s comedy.The slapstick style was still very funny despite the very dated surroundings.Poor quality film, Model T cars and careless editing often showed up,but basic comedic genius well executed still made you overlook the shortcomingsThis show`s use of Hans Conried was a great marriage of talent to subject.It`s easy to overlook his skill,but he had an amazingly deft touch to his humor that was a great compliment to this material.Long before film restoration was widely regarded as valuable, this show`s use of old stock probably was responsible for savingf several of the great silent classics.It`s worth a look for that as well as an offbeat, often zany look at film humor."
2,"So disappointed, so very disappointed","I laughed like a loon when I watched these shows as a kid. My sides hurt and tears came to my eyes. For years, I told people that that this was the best, most creative, funniest show ever aired. I tried for the longest time to find copies of even one show but I never did. Suddenly, I found this collection on Amazon and I was in heaven. When it arrived, I ripped it open and started to watch. I fell asleep before I got through the first episode. I was crushed. Nary a laugh or even a snicker on the DVD. Truly disappoined after decades of waiting. Sigh!"
2,Great film quality but not a whole lot else..,"The first twenty minutes of this movie were really interesting, and the next two hours were equal parts meandering, bizarrely comical, and redundant. The half an hour of explanation by a mysteriously placed detective was completely unnecessary (I think the filmmakers must have been afraid of just leaving it to make no sense, so they try to tie it up in a neat little package), and the last scene is completely laughable. ""Meh"" is a good description for this film, but at least the film looked expensive."
1,Horribly Boring Malformed Men,"This is super boring and not very shocking at all. Sex? None. Sure there is nudity, but it's all like a few Japanese folk singers ate some pot brownies and decided to take up residence in a costume shop for a while. A few topless chicks and lots and lots of meandering scenes. The malformed men are just people covered in flour or what seems to be birthday cake! I want my money back. Trust me. You don't want this. I enjoy weird, but this did not do it for me. Rampo and Tsukamoto make weird Japanese stuff. Try other stuff by either of these two. Ishii missed the mark with this one."
1,lost in translation,"I bought this because of Dave Kehr's review in the NY Times. Guess he must have seen the version with subtitles. The most terrifying thing about this movie is the fact that subtitles are provided for -- oh I don't know -- maybe one line in every thirty. It's like bad dreamThe quality of the transfer is good, the film looks like it might be interesting but unless you speak Japanese -- FORGET IT."
3,"Fun, But to big of a gun",This toy is great i just orderd it of line and it was really cool but the problem is that the gun is way to big. this figure is so hard to stand up because al the tim you stand him up he falls down. also he looks kinda funky with that huge gun.
5,New Title,"This book is the same basic text as ""How to Develop your Thinking Ability"" by Ken Keyes.Either book is great information for anyone wanting a step method for thinking.I read this book over 25 years ago and still use many of the principles today.This would be a good book to teach as a complete course for high school students.Buy it and follow the recommended course of study.You can't go wrong."
5,Simple and Solid,"It's a metal bar that slides freely inside a bigger metal bar. The two bars have metal squares welded to an end. The metal squares slide down into brackets that are mounted to the wall or doorframe. Very simple. Very solid. I've had approx. 350 lbs. (two large men) hanging from this bar. It is mounted in an entryway to the kitchen. Simply lift the bar up to free it from its mounting brackets to get it out of the way. I mounted it about four inches above my head so I can walk freely underneath it. I only take it down when I have guests. I highly recommend this chin-up/pull-up bar for its low cost, simplicity, and durability."
5,Awesome Album!,"All around great album.I don't own any other FTM albums, but having this one makes me crave more!"
5,Finally something different,Garroth sings like a trio and the band plays like an orchestra. Very refreshing. You'll try to sing along anyway.
1,help me out!!!,I was introduced to these guys a few months back....I had to sit through one of their shows..... unbelievable....they were awful. The singer looked like a rat on crack onstage. I have been going to concerts over 20 years. I have never seen a band like these guys. If you can run as far away as you can get...definalte one of the worst bands ever
4,Rings eclipse view of iron sights,"NcStar 1"" Weaver Ring/Silver (RS11)I bought these rings because I was looking to have an open view of my iron sights on my Ruger 10-22. The rings are a great quality item, but they did not provide what I needed because the thickness at the bottom of the rings (combined with the thickness of the rail) blocked out the view of the iron sights. I would recommend these if you either don't have iron sights or are not worried about using them while a scope is mounted on your firearm. These deserve a 5 star rating for quality, snug fitment, and design. However, they did not meet my intended purpose. I hope this helps if you are thinking about rings that allow the use of iron sights while having a scope mounted. I kept these, but boughtWeaver 1-Inch Steel Lock Mounts for Ruger 10/22 SS. These mount directly on the 10-22 without a rail and provide an open view of the iron sights. The ""SS"" indicates they are silver (as is my scope). Blued (black) are also available."
3,White Border takes away,There is a white border around the movie poster that takes away from the quality of the image. Slightly disappointed in the poster because of this.
5,Everything a professional needs,"This book has everything: sample resumes, insider's info on selection process, great advice on winning interviews, even a list of Academic and Professional Associations."
2,"Humorous, but not a must read","Love Me is funny at times, but also very depressing. It's plot is simply not exciting. I would recommend this book if you are looking for a light read, but not if you want to read a novel with any depth."
2,i'm a big fan but.............,"i love almost everything garrison writes. the key word is ALMOST. this book is just not as funny as most of his others. i bought it with high hopes and was looking forward to reading it. about halfway through i started thinking that maybe it wasn't going to get better, and i was right... just my 2 cents......"
4,"This Book is A ""Scream""",Loved it and give it four stars instead of 3 because it made me laugh out loud at times. A quirky story that I could just hear being narrated by the author in my head.
1,Wasted time,"First let me say that I love PHC. I have read many of his books. I lost interest in one of his previous books when he kept describing his elaborate meals and fine wines just too many times.I was pleased to see a book that I didn't know existed by Garrison. I ran across it in the used book section of the book store. There was a reason I hadn't heard of it before.I imagine that you are supposed to see Larry as shallow Larry and pathetic. Personally I found the whole thing boorish. I got the message. I didn't find it insightful. Instead I wanted to clock the guy and Garrison over the head with the book itself. It was page after page of mindless crap going on about writers block and a middle age man in heat.Larry, keep it in your pants - and Readers, keep your dollars."
5,My new favorite GK book,"Fans of Prairie Home Companion may or may not like GK's new book ""Love Me,"" but to fans of his books it will not disappoint. It's definitely R-rated, but in his uniquely human and self-conscious way.Not every action of the main character is likeable, but we're all flawed and fallen, which is a central theme of this book. In regards to a previous review, all of GK's books seem to be part autobiography, part fiction. I wouldn't assume that much of the book depicts real events from the author's life.If you've already read a summary of the plot, be sure that there is much more to the story. It's a very rich and rewarding book, filled with GK's insights and unique humor, but it isn't the 'News from Lake Wobegon,' and may offend some more conservative readers.I absolutely loved this book and recommend it without hesitation. If you're new to Garrison Keillor as an author, my personal favorite books are 'WLT: A Radio Romance,' and 'Wobegon Boy,' though I've enjoyed them all."
2,Not a Home Companion and no where close to Lake Wobagon,"Garrison Keillor often seems obsessed with sex. Sex is a good thing, but ""Love Me"" is too much of that one good thing. Stick to radio."
2,Great First Chapter,"The first chapter is brilliant and laugh-out-loud funny (it got me several strange looks on the subway).But ""Love Me"" has a huge problem: on the first chapter, Keillor tells the reader what's going to happen in the rest of the book. So after chapter 2, you know the plot. There are no surprises and not much incentive to keep reading. Also the writing is not nearly as good as it was on chapter one.My suggestion would be to read only the first chapter; the rest of the book is a waste."
3,Tourney chess set,"The case that came with this set is nice. The board will be similar to any of the vinyl types you may have seen in & around your club, but the pieces, although Staunton, are way too light. I would hold off for some weightier types for easier over the board play."
1,Scroll back through the reviews...,"I wish I had. I bought this DVD player on the strength of the 5-star reviews. When it arrived, I was so pleased. The player seemed sturdy and high in quality. I bragged to all my relatives about the low price I paid. I used this thing for exactly 2 roadtrips and it *died* right in the middle of a Dora the Explorer disc. It no longer recognizes there is a disc in the player. This thing is a lemon. As if our landfills weren't overflowing already. Please don't waste your money."
4,good valued portable dvd player,"This unit is nice with the fact that the battery pack is flat and takes up the same surface area as the bottom of the unit, whereas other units would have a bulky battery that would attach to the rear or bottom and would make the unit seem like it's got a sore thumb sticking out. A few other pluses, the battery is a NiMH, the unit will play PAL & NTSC formats, can dislay in widescreen or full, can be made to play foreign dvds (region free). Just make sure to ""Burn in"" the player. I let mine run overnite on repeat for two nites. If something serious was to happen, it should happen by now. Had the unit for 2mths. Only drawback is a few low-quality (no-name brand) dvd-r's were not recognizable by the unit. If you got an AMEX, or some other credit card with purchase protection, get it with that. (extends the warranty up to 1yr if full purchase price is used by the card)"
2,coby dvd player,"I bought this for my daughter for christmas and it worked fine for about a week. She loved it and took it everywhere with her. Then one day it just stopped recognizing the disks. it kept flashing ""wrong disk"". Even on ones it just played the day before. I guess you get what you pay for if it's cheap it's for a reason. I would not recommend this player to anyone. A waste of money!!!!!"
2,Great while it lasted - it WILL break....,"This unit will fail approx. 91 days after you begin using it. Bought two in December and they BOTH (BOTH? - yep - BOTH) died last week (about 4 days apart). The A/V outputs are great - quality picture and sound. The A/V inputs are great, too - kids were able to hook up the Gamecube. etc. But alas, like other reviewers have noted, one day the DVD player would not recognize DVD's anymore. It's a shame, a good unit, when it functions, but poooooorly built and destined to fail. Avoid it."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Oh sure it was great in the beginning.....then the portable power cord had to be replaced; to the tune of $30.00. Not 2 weeks later the entire unit decided to stop working; getting what appears to be a software error so it comes on but will not play a thing; it did not even last 1 year. The Coby on-line ""tech support"" was NO HELP what-so-ever but they'll be glad to LOOK at it (not fix it) for $31.00. Well we are not willing to sink any more money into this thing. Won't be buying a COBY next time!"
2,Poor video quality. Manual aspect ratio adjust.,"I'm amazed that people like the video quality on this thing. Look at it carefully! Jagged lines, flickering with stripes, really really poor job on the video resampling here. The other thing is that you have to adjust the aspect ratio manually! The things will play EVERYTHING at 16:9 widescreen even if the DVD is a 4:3. To adjust it, (very hard to find in the manual) press the LCD option button, then the right-left arrows."
1,One of the worst DVD players you could buy-AVOID!,"This DVD player has terrible build quality and feels very cheap. It isn't even worth it at half the offerred price. Mine broke the day I received it. After playing it for about 30 minutes, it just turned off and would not turn on ever again. I returned it to Amazon, totally unimpressed.For not much more money, you could get a Toshiba or Phillips model, which are way more reliable.You may be tempted to think this Coby DVD player is a good buy but you actually get more bang for your buck and reliability with another player that won't just quit working on you.This DVD player is total garbage!"
1,Returned Two,"I had to return two faulty DVD players. One would freeze frame the picture and the audio would keep on playing. The replacement DVD player kept saying ""Wrong Disc"" and was very very loud when it would actually play a disc. I ended up having to search and find a different DVD player all together because they wouldn't replace the 2nd faulty product. (Which was packaged inappropriately and possibly damaged in shipment)."
2,Not up to expectations,Battery life is poor - only about 110 minutes. Not enough to watch any movie to completion without a recharge. Sound level inadequate. Can't adjust volume high enough to hear over the sound of the engines on a plane. Picture good and controls easy to use.
2,It was good :) .......while it lasted :(,"When we first got this player, we enjoyed all of it's features. Then, we had to order another charger because it did'nt charge the unit. After that, the mechanism that holds the disk fell apart so we had to return the entire unit for a partial refund because we had went past the 30 day window. We are now the proud ownwers of a brand new charger we can't use. I will never ever buy any product from COBY again. It was good....while it lasted."
1,Don't buy this one,"I bought this DVD player (had to use a gift certificate) in May 2006 and used it for one week-end in June. I took it out in November to use it and there was no display. Of course, the warranty has expired."
4,Good Device,for cost - benefit its a great portable dvd player. high sound quality and very good image.
4,Coby - DVD7100 Portable DVD Player,"Before purchasing a portable DVD player, I researched several brands. I wanted something simple to operate, and easy to transport to different places. I was very pleased with my selection."
1,This is garbage!,"I've had this Coby for less than a year. I've used it probably for my children 4 times in the 10 months that I've owned it. It's now completely and utterly useless as it no longer works. All I get is a grey screen - nothing else. Unfortunately, I cannot return this useless DVD player."
1,Garbage!,"The only positive I can think of is the price, this unit is cheap! Our daughter rec'd it for Christmas and it simply stopped working after about 3 1/2 months of very light usage. This was conveniently after their generous 90 day warranty had expired. Tech support was worthless, they referred us to the purchasing store. Of course, no one repairs a $100 piece of electronics anymore.Unless you want cheap, avoid this unit."
3,Average Player,"The Coby has a decent display and features but my sample has a VERY noisy transport, volume extremely low at full volume and battery use is a good bit less than advertised. O.K. for the price but nothing great."
1,I Strongly Urge You NOT to Buy This Product,I used this product less than a dozen times before it stopped working. The sound was way too low and I had to buy a speaker system and now I have a speaker system and no DVD player. I got no satisfaction from the service department. I like to support companies that I haven't heard of before to give them a boost against the big names. I will never buy ANY product from Coby again.
1,Player was broken within less than one month,"This player is not dependable. From the day I received it, it sometimes did not load DVD's to play on the first attempt. I would have to restart the machine or re-load the DVD for the machine to accept it. After three weeks of normal, careful use, it stopped working for good. The screen just showed a bunch of random pixels and distorted sound. I had to return the device to Amazon."
3,not that great,I bought this dvd player in February. It worked fine for a while then in the end of July I kept getting wrong disk error code. The coby rep said try cleaning it. Did that no luck. They say they will send a new one if I send them $31.00 money order for delivery to and from. Lets see!
1,Probably nice....if it worked,"Purchased this portable DVD player last Christmas. Unfortunately, after it was opened it was clear something was wrong as the motor made grinding sounds and it wouldn't load (naturally...) a DVD. I had chosen it based on reviews at the time and the price.Alas, we shipped it back to Amazon and got a refund with no hassles! Because of the lack of quality control, I can only give it one star."
1,Big disappointment,"My boyfriend bought me this player for Christmas. It was supposed to be for a long plane ride we were taking for the holidays. It worked great for about 5 minutes and then the monitor went all crazy, with white lines and weird symbols. I turned it off and started it again. It did the same thing after about 3 minutes. So, I looked in the manual and it said in case of malfunction, unplug for 30 mintues. What kind of bologna is that?!? So, of course I tried it. Nope. Same problem everytime. So, I had to send it back to amazon and didn't have the player for the plane. Big Disappointment!"
1,Cheap but expensive!,"Well, i bought this dvd for my daugther last christmas, she used for a week and suddenly stop working... we still dont know what happened, it just went off!..Because i live outside the US, now im trying to figure out, how to return the item, IF YOU BUY THIS ITEM YOU'LL BE UNCERTAIN ABOUT ITS FUTURE..."
1,Breaks Easily and Sound Quality is Poor,"I take very good care of my electronics. Maybe I'm actually to cautious with keeping them dry, elevated, clean and away from any animals, dust or kids. However, I have so far had the one I bought in March 2005 break and it's replacement in Nov 2005 just broke today (Jan 19, 2005). Each time the Player decides to say ""No Disk,"" and refuses to do anything. This really makes no sense to me. So far Customer Service has been nice, but I only wish I had bought a higher quality player so that I wouldn't have to deal with this."
1,Piece of junk,"We purchased this player prior to a road trip. We have a 3 year old and wanted to keep him entertained for the 6 hour drive. We ordered the player and payed extra to overnight the player before we left on the trip. It came to the house and I hooked it up in my truck and it played no problem. The next morning there was a problem. All of out DVD's are legal. We kept getting Wrong Disk errors. After finally just smacking the player around out of frustration, it would play a few hours and then quit.This is the worst DVD player I've ever come across. Don't buy it.Plain and simple it sucks."
1,"This is a piece of junk, don't waste your money!","You get what you pay for! I bought this for it's low price and I'm sorry now. Less than six months of use and it no longer works. I get a NO DISC error or WRONG DISC error for the majority of the DVDs I try to play. Some searching on the web has enlightened me that this is a common problem for this player, and of course it's out of warranty. I have tried contacting Coby with no response. If you want a disposable DVD player, this is the one for you."
1,Disappointed,I order this product for a gift and ended up keeping it...of course it wasn't opened until after the warrenty expired. The battery green light shows charged but never works when trying to use it for service. I don't know it the battery is bad or the player. I wouldn't buy this product again.
1,Very Dispointed! Wish I had returned rather than changed,"I bought this DVD on Aug. 14. When it arrived, I found that I cannot plug the power line into the AC Adapter. I called Amazon. The reps were very nice. But I made a mistake! I should have RETURNED it rather than replaced it!The replacement came promptly. I took it on a trip for the first time use. Within a week, the power switch falled off. I was going to call Amazon again. But feel not worth it and thought I would just use the remote.All in a sudden, on Nov. 11, whatever DVD I put in, it keeps saying wrong disc!!! All these are legal DVDs!!!Now, I no longer can return this to Amazon! I don't know what I am going to do with it!DON BUT THIS DVD PLAYER!!!"
5,so far so good,"i bought one of these 2 weeks back. i've used this dvd player about 3-4 times. it seems ok.the volume is not that great.the first time i used it, the battery ran for just about 2 hours.technical service at coby replied to my query immediately.not a bad product for the price range.-ajay"
2,Great until it stops working,I bought this for my son on road trips. It was working great then after a short two months won't read the discs anymore. I tried a bunch of different dvds...nothing. It just says no disc. Now I have to go through the hassle of getting it fixed.
5,Everything I wanted it to be,I bought this and used it on a trip and loved it. I'm giving one to all my six grandchildren as Christmas gifts.
2,NOT compatible PAL,"As mentionned in technical data, IT IS NOT TRUE THAT it is compatible with DVD-Video (both NTSC- and PAL-formatted discs).It's a pitty to promise wrong things."
4,"excellent quality, great price",Got it before a long car trip. Great picture resolution and performance. Many functions and quality integrated. The volume is perfect for one or two headphone. If we need higher volume for more audience we conected to speakers. Happy with the buy. 100% recommended it
5,Nice Portable DVD Player,"This is a great little protable DVD player for the camper. We don't always take our laptop with us everywhere ... so this DVD player fits the bill. Of course like any other electronic device that has to run on a battery, it doesn't have as long of a charge as I would like."
1,It worked great . . . for one day.,"It worked fine the first day.The second day it refuses to play any DVD. Keep getting ""wrong disc"" error when playing DVDs. It still can play CDs."
1,Never did play a DVD,I tried 5 DVD's and everyone said wrong disk. Never did get it to work. Returned it.
1,recd a defective player and dont know if I'll ever get my money,"I bought this player from amazon .Slow delivery and when i got this product everything powered up but when i moved the screen ,everything was bit mapped.I got this as a gift for my daughter.A month later She received her gift and it booted up but no picture or sound.This is my 1st time on Amazon and if I dont get my money back ,it will be my last."
4,Excelente compra,"Muy satisfecho con la calidad de reproducción de sonido e imagen, tanto autónomo como ligado a un TV."
3,NO DISC,THE DVD HAS STOPPED WORKING TODAY AS WHEN I PUT THE CD/DVD IN IT IT ALWAYS SAYS ''NO DISC''. IT WAS WORKING FINE UNTILL YESTERDAY. BUT I DO NOT KNOW WAHT TO DO; PLEASE ADVICE THANXXS AND BEST REGARDSREGARDS MUBARAKP.S. MY KID TOLD PLEASE DADDY WHEN MY DVD WILL WORK AGAIN SO IAM RELAYING THIS QUESTION TO YOU ''HELP.P.S. IT WAS WORKING TODAY I WOULD SAY IT IS 4 STARS BUT SINCE IT IS SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING THEN THATS WHY MY RATING IS 2 STARS
3,Not a good product,"I bought this DVD player for $150. I was happy with the price but was not happy with the equipment. Firstly, the battery never lasted for the 3 hours that it says it would. The longest time was 2 hours and 50 minutes. Okay, I could live with that. Secondly, the volume would be at its highest and I still would not be able to hear over the surrounding noise. Mind you, I used my Sony headphones instead of the Coby ones. The last straw was that the cover was easily scratched the second day I got it. I returned this item and I am currently looking for a new DVD player."
1,Not good,What a bumer for Christmas. Played 1/2 of a DVD then died. Returning to Amazon for a different manufacturer's player. Good luck.
1,Junk,"Nice try, but no cigar. Fortunately, I received it as a gift because there's no way I would have bought it: Grainy picture, noisy disc drive, poor battery life and it overheats. COBY is not a good brand. Don't waste your money on their disposable products."
1,Short Warranty Period,"I was considering this product and decided to call Coby concerning the short (90 day) warranty period because so many reviewers discuss their portable DVD players breaking. Coby offers no extended warranty, and the receptionist told me that after-warranty repairs require the purchaser to pay for shipping and also send along a check for $31. This is just about six times the cost of a year's extended warranty at Walmart."
4,Bought two!,"Works great. I used them on a 10,000 mile summer road trip from Alaska to Ohio and then the Oregon coast and back again. I used one as a master and plugged it into the ""video in"" on the second player. So everyone watched the same DVD at the same time. Then I plugged the audio out into the car stereo so everyone could here it, too. I opted for this method instead of buying a single system with 2 monitors because I like having 2 complete DVD players instead of just one player with two screens. Plus, when I take a longer flight, I have 2 batteries to take along.The speakers aren't very loud so I suggest headphones for personal use."
4,Great Find,"I needed a inexpensive ""pass the time"" gift for my husband's upcoming surgery. This was everything he will need to pass the hours while stuck in bed, and it didn't break our budget."
2,Good While it Lasted,"This player worked pretty well for 8 months and I used it a lot. I was a little annoyed by the humm it made while playing a movie. My husband says I am too sensitive to noise and calls me ""bat ears"" though so maybe it wouldn't bother most people. The real problem is the one mentioned by others: it konked out after 8 months and started giving me the ""no disk"" and ""wrong disk"" messages. We bought the extended warranty and NEW sent us a check for $119 without any hassle. But now I have to buy a new one and have been without it for 3 weeks already. Why can't someone make one of these things that will last?"
1,Bought 2 - Bad Idea,"Bought 2 of these things. The first one our son broke (at least that's what we thought). The picture was good and the price was right, so we bought a second one. This time we did not let our son touch it. It just died after 2 months of use. It stopped reading and loading discs. I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,Junk Junk Junk,"I resent the fact that I can't give this DVD player ""0"" stars.It used to work fine -- as a matter of fact, just about until the time that the limited warranty ran out. Now, after about an hour of use, it gets hung up and just spins around and won't go forward or backward or anything. Unplugging the player for 30 minutes (as Coby's trouble shooting guide suggests) does seem to ""reset the player,"" but then it's only good for about another hour of use before the problem happens again.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
1,Spend your hard earned money elsewhere,"Bought this product last summer due to it's fair reviews. It has been nothing but a PIECE OF JUNK. We bought it for our then 16 month old twins for a plane trip we were taking and then for the car. This is what has happened with it in less than one year. It worked great upon arrival with the cords or the battery. Prior to the trip we tried using it in the bedroom with the tv cords-10 min. into the movie the movie went black and white. Changed movies, unplugged the cords and replugged, tried days later-same thing black and white picture. Then a couple months later the car charger died. Then soon after the battery died. Then the ac/dc charger died. Every replacement cord (not from manufacturer) dies within minutes-so obviously it is the machine. Now we have a cord killing dvd player that in less than one year has become useless. If we buy a new one I'll be sure to get a different brand."
5,Nice little dvd player - trouble free so far,"Just took this player on a 10 hr each way plane trip and found it to work very well. On the advice of another reviewer of portable dvd players on amazon, I made sure to conduct my own ""burn in"" period right after I received it - kept it running for about 24 hrs straight. Performed perfectly then, and since. My 3 young kids have dropped it a couple of times and been pretty rough with it, but no issues. I'm considering buying a second and would have no concerns about buying exactly the same one again.I also got the engergizer universal dvd rechargable battery for about $50 at amazon, and so we've got oodles of battery life for this thing."
5,yeah baby rock'n'roll coby dvd player,"i bought this coby 7 incher and it rocks, if you hook up titaniumheadphones to this system it kicks butt,great color ,great soundexcellent performance,this coby plays so great i bought a another one , to get the battery and have a spare before they sell out, this product is top qaulity at a excellent priceanybody giving negative feed back dont have one , this coby rocksGREAT JOB COBY"
1,You get what you pay for.,I bought this to use in the car to play DVD's for my 4 year old. I didn't want to spend alot of money and figured if it broke I could always buy a new one. Well it broke after 2 months and now I'm buying a new one (different manufacturer). Beware these are cheap and not made to last.
4,Good hat.,"Pretty cool hat, good price. My only complaint is the cap is a little square, i wanted it more rounder but its okay as is. Great color."
4,The Moon Was the Best,"I love this book and I love reading it to my daughter, and not just because I love Paris. It's refreshingly unique in the world of books for children--books with relatively few words, that is. The photographs are wonderful and match the text perfectly. The author has taken such a fresh approach to viewing that beautiful city, and she has chosen her words with care. The book's title is so meaningful once you read the book. This is a book I wish I had written for my daughter."
2,A Good Book if You Are Going To Paris Without Your Kids,"Tana Hoban was on my entering Kindergartener's Summer Reading List and we have read a number of her books and not really enjoyed any of them.My children (5 and 3; girl and boy respectively) just are not that interested in photographs of rainbows over apartments, or water that should have sparkles but doesn't.""She remembered the river Seineand how, going from one side of Paristo the other, you could alwayssee it sparkling in the sun.""Problem is the shot looks like it was in the evening... and no sparkles. Oh well.To be fair, the text by Ms. Zolotow is quite nice and the ending is sweet:""What was the best?"" the little girl asked.""Oh,"" said her mother, ""the mood was the bestbecause it was the same moon shining on you,so I knew we weren't far apart at all.""Two Stars. My two children did not care for this book. It might be a good book though if you are going to Paris without you kids and want to show them what they are missing."
3,Indiana Glass,"If you are from or have family that collected glassware in the Mid section of the country, this book is for you. Gives values, patterns and pattern information."
1,Not a history book,"This book is nothing more than a rehash of Stuart N. Lake's book on Wyatt Earp. Vestal has got Earp carrying the Buntline Special, walking on water and leaping tall buildings. This book would be fine along side a Zane Gray novel."
1,Absolutely useless for self-defense!,"This must be the most useless and unrealistic DVD on self-defense I've ever come across. One-dimensional, static, ineffective and with no degree of realism whatsoever. Those techniques have nothing to do with real life street fights and will get you in serious trouble out there. It's your choice to spend your hard-earned money, but it surely isn't worth it."
2,too young sounding,"I first heard Amy's voice on Back to Black which is probably causing me some difficulties in accepting her debut album Frank. If you compare the two, in Frank she is much higher pitched almost bubble gum poppish. I like my Amy with more darkness and a huskier voice. Unfortunately this may have been related to her voyage into heavy smoking, boozing and other drug use. made her voice sound awesome at least."
3,Jazz?,"I got the sampler of this album one of the reviews was something like 'she sounds like a 40s jazz singer' ... I like 40s/50s jazz so I was pysched to hear this ... it was a let down. This is NOT jazz, some songs may have a jazz feel but she is much more soul/R&B than jazz ... her voice sounds a bit like Erykah Badu, not what I expected. She's not BAD ... just not what I was looking for."
2,dont waste your time,"i picked this album up the week it was released in 2003 when i was in london and the first two listens are reasonably enjoyable, but the album doesnt age well, the songs arent terribly well written, and it gets grating after a while.do yourself a favor and check out Alice Russell, Nicole Willis and the Soul Investigators, or Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings instead."
4,better than back to black,"i had heard songs from this album on a music site and enjoyed the couple of songs i heard. when i went to buy it, couldn't find it anywhere, so i ordered it online and enjoyed it ever since. favorite song F me pumps."
4,Kind of Jazzy,I really enjoyed this. The music is kind of jazzy and Amy's voice is just unbelievable. You want to get this now before Amy is dead.
4,beautiful,"this album in my opinion is far better than back to black, more jazzy and soulful and almost every song gets you hooked. the bonus disc is incredible as well. you can hear amy singing live, which is always a treat, except when she's drunk and high. buy this YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!"
5,PLEASENT SURPRISE,"I didn't really like Back to Black, but wanted listen to another side of Amy. This cd is excellent, but i my be baised as i enjoy jazz music. This is the Album that should've earned her a Grammy. It's makes her early death even more tragic. The studio and live tracks are an added bonus. Amy never sings a song the same way twice, but they all are great. Get this CD today!!."
5,Amy Amy Amy,"If you are a fan you will want all three albums of Amy's art.This was the last one I purchased and my less fav, but it isstill great."
5,Like Billie Holiday...,"And no, I don't mean her voice. I mean the way you can hear her voice get a little grittier with every drink and drug, just like Billie near the end of her life. Her vibrato was harsh and forced and she couldn't hold the notes like she once could. And I see that happening with Amy...especially when you listen to Frank and then hear her sing Back to Black.And, no one realizes that there's a song by Amy Winehouse called ""Know You Now"" and it was originally on this album. It is by far my favorite and NO ONE KNOWS about it. It has a very jazzy tempo and it's really tasty.In comparison to each other, Frank is way better than Back to Black. In comparison to other artists, Amy Winehouse is better...even when she's at her worst.Also, the amazon.co.uk reviewer got the song and lyrics WRONG...the song that had the lyrics ""you wouldn't want me to be lonely..."" is ""I Heard Love is Blind"" NOT ""F*** Me Pumps."""
4,Unique and Refreshing Sound,Amy Winehouse is featured on many British compilation CD's and so I decided to finally pick up the CD and I am so glad that I did!! Amy Winehouse delivers the perfect blend of jazz and r&b. Her unique vocals are definitely refreshing. It is a well produced CD and I would highly recommend it. Think Billie Holiday mixed with the soul of Mary J!!
4,69 and young,"This was a gift for my father, who will turn 70 next year. Both my mom and dad love various music and are always open to new things. This year they even hit an Alice Cooper concert! When my brother and his partner introduced Amy Winehouse to my dad- he loved her. He called to suggest he might get this CD from 'Santa'.Keep rockin dad!!!!"
5,Sorry I Didn't Listen,"I had no idea what you sounded like. Now I know and love you. I'll also give 5 stars to ""Back To Black""."
4,"E. Sato - Santa Monica, CA",I love Amy Winehouse and I love this CD! Really enjoy listening to this CD at home and driving around in my car. Can't wait for her next CD.
5,A Hit,"I was able to purchase this at a great price, not long after Amy's death. I now have all her CD's. Amazon took care of me as usual. Amy will be missed. A great talent gone to soon"
5,Great album,She lives on in her music. So much character and soulfulness in her voice. Reminds me a little of Janis Joplin.
3,Mixed production,"I obtained this video as a birthday present, and have a mixed reaction to the scripting evident throughout. Although PBS itself has taken some hard knocks from conservatives eager to decry it as a leftist haven, the teleplay for a 'tribute' borders on the negative and repitituous.Yes, the man known as 'slick willie' had more than his share of personal flaws, yes they were frustrating for both the American people and his inner circle, but that does not alter the fact we had a budget surplus and economic recovery after years of failed elitism.Viewers also willing to look through choppy editing can readily discern Bill and Hillary really do love each other, a factor conviently overlooked by many self-appointed 'Clinton bashers' themselves also lacking perfect marriages."
1,"Not Frontline, low quality ABC work",This is not the usual high quality productions that fans of Frontline have come to expect. Instead we get a typical quickly tossed together dumbed down version of events from ABC News crew. This program has a nightly news 2 minute tossed together feel to it that lacks any depth and none of the insight and careful editing and production values that are hallmarks of Frontline shows.
3,Biased Review,"Though I have yet to see this movie, I am saddned by the biased I read on the first review for this product. The person obviously hated President Clinton and is looking at anything that dosn't say that Clinton's a terrible human beeing as a tragedy of Americana. Please don't use completly bias in reviewing something like this. It just makes you look like your 12 years old."
5,Incredible book that's not just about basketball,"I'm a huge basketball fan, and bought this book based on quite a few recommendations. It was incredibly well-written and was about so much more than sports. A must read."
5,sports journalism at its finest,"There's not much I can say, but that Halberstam seems to capture so much of the soul of the team, characteristics I doubt the players or coaches recognized themselves at the time. He catches the team at a time in which the culture of the NBA is shifting and its audience is rapidly growing, both heavily due to new lucrative TV contracts. Some of the most interesting sections of the book entail his individual profiles of the players on the team, Kermit Washington in particular.Halberstam has given us a fantastic story and has gone behind the scenes to do so. I was shocked by the similarities between the game then and the game now, and horrified at some of the daily obstacles borne by most of the black players, which the Halberstam describes without mincing his words."
5,For the Love of The Breaks of the Game,"The Breaks of the Game is an excellent portrait of of the Blazers, and probably the best basketball book of all time, but it is also much more. Halberstam expertly relates his account of the team and the sport to the nation's racial issues and a new era of commercialization in America. His treatment of the topics still seems refreshingly progressive, honest, and relevant nearly 30 years later. The Breaks of the Game is must read for basketball fans, and a good read for non-fans interested in American culture."
5,Terrific read,"Simply one of the best books I have ever read about basketball. Brought me back to a time when NBA players were more like ordinary people, with the same triumphs and concerns that we all face. The character development by David Halberstam was very good, and kept the book interesting to the last page. Highly recommended."
3,"Solid, not spectacular","There's no doubting Halberstam's thoroughness, but you better be really interested in the minutiae of the NBA's history. I am so I enjoyed this and could overlook the repetitive nuggets of information but wouldn't recommend this to a passing fan."
3,A trip without a destination,"Like all his books, it's well written, but unless you are a die-hard Portland Trailblazer fan that wants all the inside info from distant 35 years ago, there's nothing of particular exciting interest in this story. There are no surprises or revelations. I found it a ""slightly interesting stroll in a park."""
5,One of the most thorough books on basketball I've ever read!,"This book is definetly worth reading for anyhoops fan worth his or her salt. I discovered it byaccident in July 1990 and have read it at least 50times. It's been a great help for me in learning thebackground of the game--the greats, the majorcrises, etc. Anybody who loves basketball willappreciate this book. You MUST read it!"
4,Time to put the IDM moniker to rest,"With Confield, Autechre no longer belongs in the IDM movement, they've moved well beyond into the realm of audio sculptors like Zoviet France, Brume, and Illusion of Safety. If you don't like musique concrete, noise, or ambient drone, I'd steer clear of this release. However, if you are feeling adventurous, and are willing to discard your notions of what music should sound like, give the new Ae a try."
4,"It's Music Jim, but not as we know it...","This album has already courted some controversy, mainly from less tolerant technocrats who claim that Autechre's machines are playing themselves and that the ""con"" in the title says it all. However, no-one with commercial or artistic ulterior motives would offer a work as structurally contrary or as stylistically opaque as this. It's the sound of monotony waging war on itself, the soundtrack to a graveyard of wind-up toys, electronica's answer to the ethics espoused by Free Jazz. You will find listening to this entire album just as daunting as the works of Derek Bailey or Iannis Xenakis. This doesn't make ""Confield"" high art, just music made from a radically different perspective and burdened by the pitfalls that accompany such an approach."
5,best yet(student20Denmark),"auctechre is the musicians i know off that had eveloped most, and just got better and better. This is the most intruging lp ive heard with them yet. They are some of the most talented artist around after my opinion along with Aphex Twin(not around anymore), Brian Eno, Nobukazu Takemura, Oval, Ryoji Ikeda. Also i can recommend Cex, Hrvatski, U-ziq and Squarepusher.autechre ive always meant that are listented to with lower layers in the brain, a more unconsious part."
4,A step down from EP7,"It seems like booth/brown and putting less work into their newer efforts than in the past. EP7 was their crowning achievment, songs like maphive 6.1 and netlon sentinel were what made Autechre so good. It's too bad (at least for me) that these songs sound like they should have come somewhere in between LP5 and EP7, rather than after EP7. Most of the songs on here are as enjoyable as the worst tracks on EP7. In comparison to everyone else out there, that's still pretty good, and I'm sure that I will like this CD more with time, but it definitely didn't meet my expectations."
1,"turn that down, I'm listening to the microwave!!","This album has all the appeal of a dirt sandwich. Sean Booth and Rob Brown, the duo that created ambient masterpieces such as Incunabula and Amber returned in 2001 offering their contractual obligation - Confield. The CD starts out bad and gets progressively worse. I found myself irritated by track 4 and depressed by track 7 that I had spent my money on a CD wrought with spastic, unconfined space junk. The music conjures up an image of our duo furiously creating loops and samples so firmly rooted in the future of how ambient music might sound, that they never stopped to think of how it should sound. I can't offer and explanation, only an interpretation of Confield. Booth/Brown have run out of ideas. Confield misses the mark with their latest attempt. ""PS2 gains sentiency, quits day job to write music full time"" PS2 - ""I'm very proud of Confield, it offers a binary appeal - very one dimensional"""
1,sigh.,"sorry guys, but this album is atrocious. as an autechre completist I purchased this as an import and realized quickly I had made a huge error. i understand an artist's need to develop and change their sound, but to what territory are these two heading? this is just gross noise and my CD sits on my shelf collecting dust. i havent even purchesed their latest EP because i'm afraid it will resemble this mess. what a shame.P.S. to correct a previous reviewer, their record label is ""Warp,"" not ""Warped,"" and autechre's first LP is ""Incunabula,"" not ""Amber."""
2,"holy smoke batman, this doesn't sound too good!","Despite every cd on this site being rated between 4 and 5 stars, i have learned(to the detriment of my bank account) that this simply is not the case. Of course people may genuinly appreciate this album, and good for them, but be careful! This album has no melody, no charm...in fact, there are no redeamable features whatso ever. The 2 stars accounts for my determination to believe that i got some kind of value for my money."
1,Awful,"I'm a fan of Autechre and like many of their recordings that are ""off the beaten track"", inaccessible and difficult.Occasionally something is just plain bad. Just plain boring. This is it. Confeld is monotonous and irritating. In a word: awful."
4,Gemstones From Another Existence,"Perhaps one of the most inspiring albums Autechre has released, Confield expresses musicality in exclusively unique ways. Cfern was a gateway for me to understand just how important their music really was. Its melodic shapes and rhythmic variations are fascinating. The album is important and unlike anything they've produced."
2,Over my head,This was recommended to me by my psychologist so I bought it. It is too technical for a lay person and I got more frustration than use out of it.
4,Great advice,"If you suffer from anxiety or a deep fear, you are not alone; this is a part of the human condition. But we don't have to suffer endlessly because anxiety has an internal structure in the form of negative thoughts and beliefs powered by emotional energy that has become frozen in place. Uncover these patterns of negative thoughts and you are on the way to making significant change. As a mindfulness-based psychotherapist, I use mindfulness as the primary tool for doing just this, and I would recommend anyone to learn more about the therapeutic use of mindfulness in conjunction with good self-analysis. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."
5,Awesome deal!!,"This book was in such great shape, I was thoroughly pleased with my purchase. Highly recommend this seller to anyone. A+A+A+A+"
1,how bad can you get...,This was a HUGE disappointment; it was NOT a workbook but a hardcover college-type textbook. Difficult to use exercises and not easy for my clients to read eiter. VERY disappointed. TOO much trouble to send back. They got me on this one....
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"I PLACE THIS AT THE TOP OF A LIST OF 6 BOOKS. THE WORST BOOKS THAT I EVER READ. BOOKS I VERY MUCH WISH I HAD NEVER READ. I STILL CANNOT FORGET THE DISGUSTING IMAGES FROM THIS BOOK, ESPECIALLY NEAR THE END.ANOTHER BOOK ON THE HORRID LIST IS SWIMSUIT BY JAMES PATTERSON.IT WAS A VERY SHORT TRIP TO READING EVERYTHING BY WALLER TO NEVER READING ANY OF THEM. THE SHORT STORIES OF ""Old Songs in a New Café""IS VERY GOOD.BORDER MUSIC HAS A COUPLE OF SAD, UNHAPPY, DEPRESSING CHARACTERS."
3,Mixed feelings,"Beautifully written pros, although a bit redundant at times. I have to admit I did not want to put it down. The jumping back and forth between Jack Carmine and his Uncle left me confused at times. Why? I do not think it added anything to the story. Pulling in Vietnam just seemed like an afterthought. Waller spent a great deal of time describing Jack and Linda to us, but seemed to grow tired of writing the story and ended it. NOTHING happened! I am a huge Waller fan, but his writing seems to run hot and cold."
5,Prose - Not Plot - is Why I like it,The best thing about this book is not the plot but the language Waller uses to describe the thoughts of the characters. I felt that I was reading F. Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's plots were fairly simple but his descriptive prose and making the reader get inside the characters was his specialty. Waller does the same thing. You can feel what the lonely housewife was feeling in the BRIDGES and you can identify with Linda and Jack and all the other characters in this novel. You know what they are thinking and you can understand their internal strife. It reminds me of Jack Kerouac or even Steinbeck in TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY. The uncle and his sojourn in New Orleans was classic. He was truly a Walter Mitty but unlike Mitty he followed his instincts and headed for Mexico. This may have been a sub plot but it all tied together. A really good book if you look beyond the plot and concentrate on character development and the way Waller writes.
3,No match for Bridges here,"My first Waller book was Bridges of Madison County which I read in one sitting. I was hoping Border Music would bring the same depth of character and flowing story line. Instead I found a book running on various time lines and various characters. Instead of these other story lines helping to enlighten the main character Jack Carmine, I just found it all confusing. Out of a 280 page book, I didn't find Waller's theme of ""this love isn't going to work out"" until about page 200. Sorry, too arduous a journey of reading for me to put my recommendation on it. Go back and read Bridges again."
2,Not for me,"This a story set in Texas and the midwest about Texas Jack Carmine, a freedom-loving hardscrabble rancher, itinerant wheat-harvester and Vietnam vet and several people who were, it seems, unforgetably linked with him at some point in their lives. The books moves back and forth in time and is more reflective than action-packed. At the end, Jack's lifestyle choices seem to be made less from a love of freedom than a tragic and lonely flight from past traumas. Waller provides some beautiful moments but overall I found the story unsatisfying and the writing too cliched."
2,"Oh, come ON","Hey, to the author's credit, when the first two characters in the book are a Texan named Carmine Jack and a stripper -- of course -- named Linda Lobo, well, you've been warned. If you continue reading past page 3, you have nobody to blame but yourself.It doesn't get better. The biggest groaner was when Mr. Carmine, or Mr. Jack, meets one of Miss Lobo's disrespectful, mouthy kids, and puts the kid in his place in a manner that could only occur in a book like this one.I'lll give it two stars, because, hey, there are people that like this kind of stuff, and who am I to rain on their parade? If you can get past the first couple of pages, knock yourself out. But if curiosity compels you to read this, do yourself a favor and check it out of the library. I'm sure they have a copy."
5,A Perfect Soundtrack,"Keeping in mind that this is a soundtrack, this cd is amazing. I could do without some of the extensive rapping but the strong ballads keep this album at a 5* rating! Some great ballad are REFLECTIONS, NEVER TOO FAR, and LEAD THE WAY. Mariahs vocals soar throughout the album with a lot of belting for those VISION OF LOVE fans. What really caught my eye was the fun 1st single LOVERBOY. I Don't know why everybody said that song flopped. It reached #2 on billboard and mariah claims it was the best selling single of that year. I think mariah's breakdown, the GLITTER movie flop, and a cd release date of 9/11/01 made this cd have bad sales. It's a great dance cd with amazing ballads in between. This was Mariah's first Virgin label release and last for poor cd sales and not meeting expected success. This cd may have had the worst sales but it is in the top 5 of my favorite Mariah Carey albums."
2,Awful,"This has got to be the weakest album of Mariah's carear so far. The quality of tracks on this album are inconsistant, and the style doesnt suit Mariah. The tracks that i do like are All My Life and Never Too Far, but i feel those two dont justify me purchasing this album. I wouldnt recommend this album, i would recommend waiting for her next album where she will hopefully go back to her roots and give her fans what they want"
5,Glitter Shines!!! Mariah Shines!!!,"Mariah has never sounded so better. Her voice is amazing. With that amazing voice she could break glass. Think about it Mariah has just gotten out of a relationship, working 24/7 and her breakdown, plus her album being released on September 11, 2001, everybody forgot because of what hapened and the movie being released 10 days later- September 21, 2001 nationwide. Everybody's home mournig their loss and other peoples loss. Glitter is awesome and so is the movie. Hear are my grades for the song.Loverboy(Remix) 5/5Lead The Way 5/5If We 5/5Didn't Mean To Turn You on 5/5Don't Stop(Funkin' 4 Jamaica) 5/5All My Life 5/5Reflections(Care Enough)5/5Last Night A DJ Saved My Life 5/5Want You 5/5Never Too Far 5/5Twister 5/5Loverboy 5/5Overall Grade 100% A+Mariah I'll Love and be your #1 fan 4 life"
4,Bad movie. Killer Soundtrack!!!!!!,"I dont care about the movie, she dint do to bad. also the 80's is not her, She looked like the Mariah today! The cd is cool, Best track Last night the DJ save life.... Who cares about her breakdown, Mariah's sales has nothing to do with that its you so-called fans just been CHEAP..... But it did well it sold over 1 million copies, peak at #7 Whats is wrong with that, Thats really good for a soundtrack theses days, So stop using her issues and 9/11 for an excuse. SO BUY IT NOW!....ALSO another cool soundtrack to also get is Madonna's Whos that girl. That also peak at #7 and is also platinum.... so there."
3,Better than the I thought...,"My girlfriend recommended this soundtrack to me. I was leary at geting it, because I'm not a Mariah fan, and I didn't like 'Loverboy' the single. I ended up liking about half the songs on the album, especially 'Never too Far' and 'Reflections'. It's a decent CD."
4,Best Ballad ever here -''never too far'',All I can say its glittler has some great songs on it ! forget the critics this is an album from great singer! ''never too far '' and '' lead the way'' both prove Mariah has a fantastic voice and these two are some of the most fantastic love songs you 'll ever hear! Well done Mariah !
4,Alright,"This is not as great as other albums, but is certainly not as bad as critics made it out to be. The ballads fall short of previous ones, but the dance tracks are funky and cool. I love ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"" and ""Last Night A DJ Saved My Life."" A good up-beat album for non-Mariah fans."
4,Rushed to production,"My rating is biased because I LOVE Mariah. This album was definitely rushed to production because she just had to get the 'heck'out of sony's shadow. The stress on her voice is obvious, but a few of the songs are very personal and touching if you feel MC and possess a heart unlike... Overall I still enjoyed the album. Just the same I have to wonder about some of the not so flattering reviews in here. With such fake-fans-mottola-moles? who needs enemies. Judge for YOURselves."
3,Too Much Glitter is not Good for ya...,"""Glitter"" is a fairly decent album by Mariah, and that's only because she sought the help of 70's and 80's icons for music writing help. This album is very 80's and I love the song written and produced by Rick James! All the other songs are all right, I don't really groove off the album...I was a Mariah fan when she was Mariah, now her music is average ""here for now...gone tomorrow"" pop that will lose a listener's intrest within days...Keep Groovin..."
2,Worst Album by Mariah!,"I used to be Mariah's #1 fans. Glitter is Mariah's worst album. She sounded good on her first 6 album (Mariah Carey - Daydream), and then since Butterfly she started whispering instead of singing and wearing bad outfits. The only good tracks on this album is 'Loverboy', 'Never Too Far', and 'Lead The Way'. I give the review 2 star because I WAS her fans. If you like female singer, I recommend you to listen to Christina Aguilera or Alicia Keys instead."
3,Mariah and her blim-blingin' friends,"Mariah is one of my heroes, but I do wish she would give up on hip-hop. She's just no Lauryn Hill.Lauryn's lyrics are deep and rich. Mariah instead chooses to lay lines like this on us: ""I got myself a lover, who knows what I like. When he invites me over, I come every time.""Nice.This is a soundtrack album for a movie set in the 80's, which is also semi-autobiographical. So a lot of the songs are just rehashes of Mariah's actual past hits, retrofitted with annoying 80's instrumentals.Of course, the ballads are a good listen, and we all know that's where Mariah shines. I just wish she wouldn't fight it so much! If I have to listen to one more blanked out expletive from Da Brat while Carey croons breathily in the background, I'll just scream.That said, hope you get well soon Mariah! And stop trying so hard, we'd love you even if you never released another song."
2,This Glitter is pretty laughable.,"Mariah Carey's soundtrack to her first big movie, Glitter is a waste of '80s style pop/ r&b songs. I was such a huge fan of Mariah when she first came out but somewhere along the way she become self-involved with her career releasing album after album, she grew to be pretentious and her incredible voice began to give out. With that said, Glitter is her second weakest album (her worst is the hideous and unlistenable Rainbow). But she does she shines on the ballad, Never Too Far and Reflections. Loverboy is just another take on Dreamlover, Fantasy, Honey, Heartbreaker, etc. This soundtrack is anything but inspiring."
1,her worst CD ever,"the only good songs are lead the way, reflections and never too far. The beautiful ballads saved this CD. The rest is bland 80's wannabe crap. How mariah thinks this is her best CD since Butterfly beats me"
2,THE WORST OF MARIAH CAREY,"I heard the negative hype surrounding this album and I decided to ignore it and buy the album. I wish I should have believed it!The album is full of either disturbing or stale tunes. Her collaborations with Ja Rule and Eric Benet are terrible,to say the least. The only ""glittering""songs are ""Loverboy"" and ""Never Too Far Away"",where she stretches her voice to the max.I hope Mariah comes back with a much better album next time."
1,WEll....,"Well, I think anyhone who can buy an album by Mariah will always think it is cool. Go figure..."
2,Disappointment,"Disappointment is the word to use in spite of this cd. I am disappointed with Mariah on this album. She basically sampled 80's songs-ones that don't fit well with her type of music.It seemed like she rushed it, and not spent her time to make it good as her past multiplatinum albums. I can't believe this is a Mariah Carey-I am that disappointed. Mariah is good at those ballads,r&b,hip-hop,soul,slow,and some up beat songs and albums, but this wasn't her best. I recommend something like 'Butterfly','Daydream', or 'Musicbox',those were her best.Hopefully her next cd will be MUCH better."
1,Glitter went straight to the Litter,"I bought the cd but was I ever sorry. I was so mad at this Glitter that I threw it staight in the Litter. It should have been called Litter instead. I preferred Celine's God Bless America, but I did NOT apprecite thiscd at all. Poor poor job. She should retire. She's run out of ideas. The albums at # 50 this week after just a few eeks of release. It shows people are not buying this cd. You shouldn't either. You'll be so sorry. Trust me. You'll toss glitter to the Litter."
1,Hard to believe she could make one this bad ................,"Mariah's life was coming apart at the seams when this cd was recorded, and that's exactly the way it sounds. Her voice was not doing what she asked of it and she was not helped by a complete absence of good songs.It was her lowest selling album and one listen will tell you why. To the 230 people who give this album five stars, I can hear John McEnroe yelling, ""You can't be serious!"""
2,Mariah's Glitter,"Overall, this album was a disappointment. Even though I am a fan of Mariah Carey, the music on this album wasn't very good. Most of the songs sound like pop and hip-hop music, and don't show off her powerful voice. Like (If We, Didn't Mean To Turn You On, Don't Stop Funkin' For Jamaica, All My Life, and Last Night A DJ Saved My Life). However, she has 2 good songs on this album, (Lead the Way, and Never Too Far). Twister was alright. Loverboy was okay. I wouldn't recommend this album to a fan who's looking for her best."
1,CAn't people see the truth...?!!,"IT's a funny thing with Mariah Carey (and other ""artists"")... The song writers know the music is bad, Mariah knows the music is bad, Sony (and now Virgin) know the music is bad, her manager knows the music is bad... But they know that the public will love it!! How? Due to sheer brain washing, using MTV, massive advertising. Now, everybody can see MAriah undressing, in an explicit move to seem like a teenager pop star. Absurd! But,e ven so, GLITTER receive 5-stars reviews.. how can it be possible? IF, even inside her own frame of work, her fans acknowledge that she released better albuns, how can this one, a mixture of hip-hop, rap and screaming vocals, be reviewed so high? Open your eyes (or ears), folks. Stop being manipulated so easily by the media. Mariah always had a great pair of lungs, but never knew how to sing. I hope her career ends as soon as possible (I may seem cruel, but I know she's already so rich, that it won't make a difference)"
1,Mariah is a Waste,"Mariah could've been in the same class as Celine, Barbra Streisand, Aretha and Whitney, but then she decided to not use her talent and decided to mumble her lyrics like the rest of the no talent wannabe artists (Janet Jackson)out there.Her music has consistantly spiraled downward since Music Box. What she chooses to do is appeal the the masses by incorporating R&B; and rap in her songs. While doing this she alienates her old fans like myself.I had the displeasure of listening to ""Glitter"" in a record shop. I already knew I wasn't going to buy this CD, especially since hearing her first horrific single Loverboy. Hearing it only confirmed my decision not to buy it.Her talent is truly wasted....."
5,Mariah glitters!,"This soundtrack album from the movie GLITTER starring Mariah Carey in her film debut really does rock! It was originally scheduled for release on August 21,2001 but she was in no condition to promote it then. She had a nervous breakdown and needed to take it easy with her career and recover. It had been delayed three weeks and coincided with the day of the terrorist attacks. Now for the songs:I DIDN'T MEAN TO TURN YOU ON was a hit for the now-deceased Robert Palmer in 1986. Mariah's cover sounds like a Prince recording from the early or mid-80's. LOVERBOY,also the remix,sounds cool. So does LAST NIGHT A DJ SAVED MY LIFE,IF WE and NEVER TO FAR. Mariah had gone from Columbia Records to Virgin on this album. She had been dropped from Virgin after this album."
5,Glitter Rocks!,"Although it had disappointing sales, Glitter is definitely Mariah's best effort (of course all hers are great, but this is the best). Every song is memorable and really good. Check out the Loverboy remix with Ludicris and Da Brat, and the awesome Ja Rule duet If We."
4,Mariah Glitters Again,"Mariah Carey once again has out done herself, producing an album that has infectious hooks and great guest artists. One of my favorite songs is ""Want You."" That is the perfect song about a high school crush who you finally get after much trial and tribulation. Another great song is ""If We"" featuring Ja Rule and Nate Dogg. It makes you want to coo along with Mariah. ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"" isn't much, just Mariah singing the chorus. ""Never Too Far"" and ""Lead the Way"" are the token ballads that Mariah has, bur ""Reflections"", another ballad, is pretty. ""Twister"" is kinda short, but ""Don't Stop"" is another great song, and rumor is the next single to be released. Overall, a great album, very danceable and lot more hip hop than anyone expected. This album also includes both ""Loverboy"" mixes."
5,Mariah Rocks The Charts..... Again,"Though i wouldnt say that this is mariahs best cd to date, it certainly is wonderful. this is not true to mariah form though, since it is a soundtrack. im sure it fits wonderfully with the movie, its just not classic mariah like we are used to. so, this being a soundtrack cd it is absolutley fabulous. favortie tracks: never too far, twister, didnt mean to turn you on, and loverboy(remix and original). i would totally recomend this to any mariah fan or a fan of soundtracks or 80's music. you wont be disappointed"
2,aside from the Rick James Jam typical Mariah,i heard this Album a couple Months back.and it didn't move me at all it sounded like typical by the numbers Mariah especially the slow cuts.but the Track with Rick James was what the DOctor Ordered.Trademark Rick James Production added so much Life to Her.I can ROck that Joint any time.if Mariah had juice like that She would be Scary.Rick James did Justice to Her.a cool Teena Marie Vibe going on.She doesn't Oversing SHe is tight as the Groove is THumping.as for What Jam&Lewis do?Business as Usual.Didn't Mean to turn you on no thanks.Cherelle threw down Mariah sounds ok at best.likewise on Jamaica Funk. the Cameo Re-Make Sucks as well.for Me I say just work with Rick James&Leave everybody else out.She found Somebody that can bring Home the Goods.
2,"""Glitter"" not up to par with previous work","I don't know where Mariah has been going with her music lately, but this definitely isn't in the good direction. Glitter has all the best intentions and elments: eighties styled music to fit with the film, ballads that are meant to evoke sincere emotion and appearances by some of today's hottest hip-hop artists. But all of these intentions fall short. The eighties music was badly made, the ballads were strained and emotionless and the constant array of rappers on this album got incredibly annoying. The rappers seem like they have more singing the song than her. In other words, it sounds like she is singing backup for them.This album seems forced. Many have said that Mariah has truly revealed her feelings on this album, but I beg to differ. The songs are too cardboard to be like that. ""Butterfly"" held much more emotion than this pile of drivel.Mariah has spent far too long focusing on finding herself. Perhaps she should just find some good music."
3,disappointment,"I love mariah and have all her CD's and she's never put out a Bad CD but this one was pretty bad. I thought it would be her best since there was 80's music influences and I'm a pretty huge fan of the 80's but that and the hip hop with it just didn't work at all. But that's not to say the whole album sucks, here are my top 5 glitter picks:Never Too FarLead the WayReflectionsWant YouDon't Stop Funkin For Jamaica"
5,Glitter,"Glitter is a great album despite what people say. Everyone should buy this album that Mariah Carey created. Mariah Carey would have gotten several other #1 hits if this album wasnt released on Sept. 11, 2001. I still bought it on Sept. 11. But Mariah Careys Glitter album is creative and is a cd you can listen to everyday."
3,Alright...but not her best!,"This album has it's highs and lows, but this is not Mariah's best CD! If you're looking for old school Mariah, you won't find too much of it here. Try Greatest Hits instead. Loverboy is a good song, along with If We. They both feature rappers, but fortunately, the rappers enhance the songs rather than detract from them. Lead the Way, Reflections, Want You, Never Too Far, and Twister are classic Mariah at her best! The rest of the songs feature rappers that make them sound annoying! I can't stand listening to more than the first thirty seconds! The worst song on here has got to be Don't Stop, featuring Mystikal. It is nothing but Mystikal rapping the verses and Mariah humming along to the chorus! Honestly, if I wanted to hear Mystikal, I would buy a Mystikal album! Well, I'm through writing, and I hope this helps you out!=0)"
4,"Good music, excellent concepts, but...","Mariah had an excellent,unique idea mixing modern hip-hop and 80's pop together. 'Glitter' has a good blend of dance music and ballads that have a lot of potential. Here's the problem though;when fans buy a Mariah album they want to hear Mariah's beautiful voice, NOT A BUNCH OF RAPPERS WITH MARIAH'S VOICE POPPING UP HERE AND THERE. That is probably one reason why some of her fans have abandoned her; because they are hearing more of her rapper friends in her music now then of her herself. I love the musical styles on 'Glitter' and the beats,so I will still listen to the album and enjoy it. Mariah-excellent concept, you have proven that you still have lots of creative genius. But on future albums, you should showcase YOUR talent, not that of everyone else; because ultimately, your albums are all about YOU and YOUR abilities not everyone else's."
3,Mariah at her more mediocre,"Ever since the 'Butterfly' album, Mariah Carey's been looking for more credibility, employing rappers such as ODB and Jermaine Dupri to spice up her records a little. On a personal level, I do not like this, but I do realise that many people will. Here there's plenty of it. Thankfully it's mixed with a real 80's disco sound which gives the songs some pep.The better fast songs here are undoubtedly 'Loverboy' and 'All My Life' whereas the ballads here are usually at least adequate. The notable exception being latest single 'Never Too Far', which is nearly as good as the strong ballads that Carey used to release such as 'Hero' and 'My All'. But to be honest, for an album that she didn't promote too well due to illness, this isn't going to fare as well as previous releases. It's simply not as strong, and whilst there are good tracks on here, there's not enough outstanding ones to make this any more than above average pop fodder."
3,Good but could have been better,"When I first heard that Mariah Carey would be doing an 80's theme for her movie and album, I was excited but then Loverboy came out and it wasn't all that. I still bought the CD and loved it when I first got it, but now I only listen to Lead The Way, Want You, Never Too Far and Didn't Mean to Turn You On. But if you like 80's music and Mariah ballads, by all means buy the CD. It's good but Mariah has done better."
2,Mariah Carey Glitter,"Mariah Carey is an amazing singer and even sometimes amazing singers can put out CD's that just arent all that great. Some of the best songs on Glitter include ""Loverboy"" and ""Never Too Far"". Not MC's best CD but it includes a few powerful ballads that are worth checking out."
2,GUTTER,"This CD isn't bad....its just too predictable as are most of Mariah's jingles. ""Never Too Far"" is the best track in my opinion."
3,Return to the early 80's!!!,"Any funk fan will freak over the tracks on here by rick james, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis!!!!!!!!!!! "" I didn't mean to turn you on"" is 5 bold stars!!! The Rick James cut is a return to the Mary Jane Girls!!!! BUT>>>> Thoses are only two songs!!! The rest of the album is rather weak!!!!"
1,glitter part 2 is being released soon,"with the capitalization of mimi, don't be surprised if there is a sequel to this horrible soundtrack and movie landing her back into the psych ward"
1,Glitter?....Rainbow?....Butterfly?....GROW UP MARIAH!,"Mariah has no class whatsoever and her lyrics have no meaning. None of these songs are worth listening to and neither are the ones on her previous albums. Also, her album names need more thought to them. Glitter? Rainbow? Butterfly? Daydream? Music Box? Sounds like something a 9-year old girl would name their album. Mariah is 32! I wouldn't be surprised if her next album was entitled LIPSTICK or UNICORNS & PONIES or some[thing] cheesy... like that. Glitter is definetley NOT worth the [money]!"
1,was she trying to be another janet jackson?,"jimmy jam and terry lewis are all over this record but their collaboration did not work well at all mariah's voice was so weird over those funky 80's beats. They work better with miss janet, mariah just tries to be sexy when janet is naturally sexy and can dance. The last time mariah dance she was like a bopping rubber chicken with so much fat that my thanksgiving turkey would be jealous"
1,trash,"this cd is not worth the 14 dollars it costs. It was a complete waste of energy and money. no matter how hard u try, you just can't dance to any of mariah's songs. This dyke troll is getting really weak and her beats are starting to get old and boring. she'll never fit into anything at dressbarn, for those of u who dont know, that's a plus size store. that nasty oreo is a straight hooch and she cant sing, she just screams and whispers like a man. she cant find a note and her face can stop a clock. lose weight! all the ppl who gave her good reviews are just trynna support her cause they're oprah lovin trash who think mariah represents compton even though shes a troll. done."
3,she so ca-raaaazy!!!,"She walk like a crazy woming, she talk like the crazy sexy cool that she would always be and she sing like that kooky little cat dat done went and et the canary birdy. Sound like a woman who needs to take what us Sexyville folk like to call ""the crazy pill"" and bleeve me I ain't talking nothing about birth control. I ain't got nothing for that stuff. You want to hear a pretty lady who sings like a crazy lil mama, listen to glittren: the soundtrack to our livelihood my love."
1,Miss Carey give yourself a break with singing...,"This CD is TERRIBLE!!! It sound just like her few previous albums (unfortunately). She could've picked few good songs form each of them and make a really nice album. When you compare this one to her first albums, Glitter sounds like something made by miss Spears, not by a woman who has a great voice. Mariah sings more technical than emotional. I wouldn't even say ""sings"", better description is ""moans"". For me it's a waste of money and your precious time."
1,All that glitters is truly not gold...,"This soundtrack certainly suits the Movie ""Glitter"" so well. I mean they both have a common characteristic, they have both failed!For this album, it seems that Mariah is making use of her so called ""diva status"" sell her records. She no longers strains her octave scaling voice anymore which actually defines her style. The mediocal tunes is just a letdown.Try harder next time, Mariah..."
2,Not so great. (2/5 Stars),"Since ""Butterfly"" (not including it), Mariah's albums have gone downhill. This is rock-bottom. After so many amazing albums (all until ""Rainbow""), what has happened to her music? As a true fan of Careys, ""Glitter"" is extremely disappointing. The few shining tracks are ""Lead The Way,"" ""Reflections,"" and ""Never Too Far.""1) Loverboy- Awful chorus and too many collaborators, but catchy. 5/10.2) Lead The Way- Good and soft ballad. 8/10.3) If We- Good upbeat song. Collaboration not too bad. 7/10.4) ...Turn You On- One of the two 'cheesy' disco renditions. 5/10.5) Don't Stop- Aboslutely awful and horrible. 2/10.6) All My Life- Just good. 7/10.7) Reflections- Deep and emotional. 8/10.8) Last Night...- Boring, and again 'cheesy.' 4/10.9) Want You- Decent, but too plain at times. 6/10.10) Never Too Far- Great love ballad. 8/10.11) Twister- Good, but repetitive. 7/10.12) Loverboy- Much better when excluding the many collaborators. 7/10.74/120- 62%: **1/2"
3,"Not Bad, Just Uneven","The ""Glitter"" album and movie seem to be on everyone's ""worst ever"" list. I've listened to the album many times, and my feeling is that it's not bad, it is just very disconnected. Maybe movie soundtracks have that tendency.One result is that the album is difficult to listen to from start to finish. The songs are mostly enjoyable by themselves, but they seem out of place on the same album.There are some really, amusingly bad aspects of Glitter... the hip-hop stunting and certain oversung passages fall into this category. All of that is part of Mariah's supposed deterioration into some kind of weird wannabe evil genius obsessed with J-Lo. But Glitter itself is an enjoyable (if somewhat silly) album."
5,the best!,"wow! pretty good i love it. she brings rap for da rap fans she brings her ballads which she is known for and some 80's feel for all of u who cant get out of da 80's its great i love it the movie waz great too. dont listen to what critics say they've been saying negative things about her sense the day she came out. ok so if your thinkin oooh shes trying to go hip-hop so what who cares music is music. One of da best remakes on da album was ""Didnt mean to turn you on"" it sounded like the origanial and thats a good thing because people dont like when some remakes a song and changes it, better to keep it origanal right?! of course it is. its totally worth buying!!"
5,The true Mariah,"Mariah's new cd Glitter is truely one of the best that she has ever done. Her songs were very east to relate to and very musical. Despite various negative responses to her album, I was very pleased when i listened to eack track. You could feel her confidence and self assurance to the music.I personally am very happy with Mariah's cd and her new and free sounds. With each song you can tell that she gave her all. Her voice is very fresh and her vocals go straight to your heart.Its ashame that Mariah has had more bad reviews that good. I wish that she would listen to her true fans instead of people that are obviously fake.Mariah has offered us another part of herself and its absolutly wonderful. Mariah is back. Stronger and better than ever."
1,Pffffffffffff,"Oh God, no !No, I'm sorry, I miss titles such as ""Prisoner"", ""Someday"", ""So cold"". (...) The pictures of her previous cds and this one are awful, the music leaves much to be desired...I respect the people who like this album, but I can't help wondering if we live in the same planet."
4,Not as Crappy as the movie!,"I actually liked this cd when it came out! Yea, I know people laughed at me, but I thought most of the songs were decent and I remember loverboy being played all over mtv and the radio. I thought the ballads were really awesome. Never tommorow brings(heck i dont remember the title?) was very powerful and moving. I also liked the fact that there were a few 80's inspired tracks on this album. Mariah doesnt really step outside of the old crooner r and b/T-pain/biggie sound. So I thought it was intersting. Most of this album is enjoyable, while the movie just down right blows balls. I just think people were alittle tired of hearing Mariah Carey(hey it happens, i havent listened to this really in at least 5 years!). Other then that, if your young , like pop, and don't remember when this came out, then you'd def. like this album. (I cant imagine anybody being any younger then me,haha!)."
1,I miss the old Mariah!,"Her old stuff was much, much, MUCH better!!! Her music doesn't inspire me anymore. Listening to this ruins the feeling I get when I listen to her past albums because I know where she has come and what she has turned into. I'm sad to say I'm a retired Carey fan!"
4,Keep on Mariah,"Even though that the movie did not go ovber too well. I still think that the cd is good. It;s not her best, but good. All the publicity about her health did not help at all either."
3,A Great CD!,"this cd has so many great songs but they were underrated just becuz everyone thought they suck just like they thought the movie did. but in fact this cd has some of mariah's best songs. for example the beautiful ballad ""never too far"" omg this song is great. and also ""don't stop"", ""all my life"", ""loverboy"" and sooo many great songs."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"I got this CD after hearing great reviews about it plus being a Mariah fan! Almost every song on here sounds like her hit Loverboy except for the the ballads I absolutely cannot stand. I like her previous albums much more, like Rainbow, it's awesome! This is just bad, mettre dans la poubelle! Don't waste your money on this! Buy her new greatest hits album!"
1,The WORST Album Of 2001!,"I am not writing this record because I dislike Mariah. I atually LOVE Mariah Carey. I own every single one of her records. However this album is so horrible that me being a fan of Mariah can not even defend it.The album contains tracks that really could have had potential but were ruined by the REDICULOUS way they were performed/produced. Some of the songs you can't even tell that Mariah is singing words. It sounds like a rapper is rapping over the drowned out beats and she is moaning annoyingly over them. I wanted to like this album. I even listened to it 3 times a day when I got it and said ""okay I am going to make myself like it!"" I turned it off every single time! It is horrible noise even many Mariah fans can not bare. Maybe this is the reason that only one of it's singles even charted and the album hass fallen out of the top 100 after 10 weeks. The only half-way decent song off this piece of junk is ""Never To Far"" but its no ""hero"" and is not worth (the money)!"
1,NO! NO! NO! This is all WRONG!!!,"I don't know why this cd got such praise from other reviewers on here but this cd is a mistake. The ballads are typical, nothing new. As for the uptempo songs, WHY ALL THE REMAKES MARIAH!!! It's ok to do one, thats almost like a trade mark for her cd's, but all of the uptempo songs is a bit much. This cd is begging for some creativity."
4,A COMPLETELY UNDERATED ALBUM,"This album was released on Sept.11....HELLO! It was pretty much doomed because of that...but truthfully it is a great album....I don't really care for the Loverboy song but the rest of the album is fun and 80's inspired because of the movie. It can't be compared to Mariah's other albums because this is a movie soundtrack, but it is a must have for the true Mariah fan!"
4,Glitter shines the most on the Japanese version!,"The bonus track on this cd, Loverboy (MJ Cole Main Remix Radio Edit), which is not only by far the best track on this cd, it should have been the single version of Loverboy! If that version were sent to DJs & radio stations instead of the lp version, it could have been her 16th #1! The interesting thing about the Japanese edition is on Sony Music Entertainment(Japan) instead of Virgin Records! Also a handwritten note to Japanese fans in the Japanese insert."
4,Glittering Songs,"I've enjoyed this CD very much. I had to purchase a new onebecause I played the first one so much, it got badly scratched.I love, Loverboy (because that's my favorite song from Cameo).Also, the song Never Too Far is a beautiful song, it alwaysmakes me cry, but I still love it. Also Last Night A DJ Savedmy life, was a nice remake. That's why I was disappointed thatI couldn't find this CD anywhere! But once again, Amazon didn'tlet me down."
5,Glitter Shines!!! Mariah Shines!!!,"Mariah has never sounded so better. Her voice is amazing. With that amazing voice she could break glass. Think about it Mariah has just gotten out of a relationship, working 24/7 and her breakdown, plus her album being released on September 11, 2001, everybody forget beccause of what hapened and the movie being released 10 days later- September 21, 2001 nationwide. Everybody's home mournig their loss and other peoples loss. Glitter is awesome and so is the movie. Hear are my grades for the song.Loverboy(Remix) 5/5Lead The Way 5/5If We 5/5Didn't Mean To Turn You on 5/5Don't Stop(Funkin' 4 Jamaica) 5/5All My Life 5/5Reflections(Care Enough)5/5Last Night A DJ Saved My Life 5/5Want You 5/5Never Too Far 5/5Twister 5/5Loverboy 5/5Overall Grade 100% A+Mariah I'll Love and be your #1 fan 4 life"
3,Mariah's pop fans take a seat,"This Mariah Album has alot going for it especially for any 80's funk and R&b fans. People who remember when the remakes and samples came out can appreciate the creativity and fun choices that were made on this record."" I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"" is awesomely redone here. Yes, Mariah's collabo's can be over done on this one but I just skip the ones that I don't care for and jam on the ones that are smokin'. If you are a true Mariah fan on ""Glitter"" you will find the cuts for you and vibe on Mariah's take on an obviously influential period in her life. The ballads do stick out of the mix though that's why it is just a good album from her and not great."
5,Great Movie/Soundtrack Despite Bad Reviews,"It's amazing that this soundtrack was seen as distasteful. I think the problem is that most people were looking for a new flavor, instead of an older 80s flavor. However, she did an amazing job and her career could really go with this new direction if people just listenend to the album and watched the movie. Which brings upon another point...in my local newspaper the movie got half a star. The plot wasn't amazing--but nevertheless, it had one, which in my book gives it at least a star. Go into the movie expecting an 80s flick--that's exactly what you get."
2,"Mariah Glitters, Stumbles, Tarnishes, All On One CD","If you don't like the sound of the 80s, stay away. Mariah plays with fire here; sometimes she hits the right notes, but she too often falls into a vat of bubbling liquid cheese. The only worthwhile cuts are:06. All My Life; wonderful Rick James-produced soul thumper; great vocals courtesy of Mariah, who ACTUALLY sounds like she did in 1995, when she sung with pleasure in her voice, not as if it were a burden.08. Last Night A DJ Saved My Life; overlong, but enjoyable nevertheless; the rapper indulgence is particularly irksome here.10. Never Too Far; an OK, by-the-numbers Mariah ballad; but that last note is simply stunning.12. Loverboy; I liked this song, despite its faults (it peters out towards the end).There you have it: 4 songs. They're fine, but do they justify the purchase of this CD? I'm afraid not. It would make a great coaster, though........."
1,Changed her Name to simply Mariah and she changed her fame,"Mariah's old songs and expecially ""Hero"" are the best one a person can enjoy. Glitter is simply[no good] ... (Sorry Mariah)... :(NB: I would have given the album a zero star but I cannot"
2,Mariah Loses Her Sparkle!,"Its hard to understand how sucha diva - with the best production team in the business can leave us with this trashy material. Glitter is a very insincere affair. Despite the luke-warm success of the lead single ""loverboy"" a retake on previous effort ""heartbreaker"" - this album has been largely ignored in the world of music - and so it should be. This is just too much of nothing! Too much rap and not enough soul. What ever happened to the emotion mariah showed in gorgeous tracks like ""my all"", ""cant take that away"", and ""without you""? You certainly wont find any of that here - the lead ballad ""never too far"" is very disappointing and mariah seems uncomfortable during her performance of it. Dont waste your money on this one!"
4,"Carey: not at her best, but FAR from her worst.","What i found odd about Glitter is this... i was so hyped for this record. i couldn't wait. but when i got it, i realized that i had a different opinion than i thought i would. Carey is definately at the top of her game here. definately the best since Daydream. there aren't, however, any ""oh my God, that is so amazing"" type of songs. none that make you pee your pants when you hear them.Which is where this review should end right? wrong.Glitter shows Carey, not as having any IT songs, but as a smooth flow of music and class. as i play this cd, there is not one song that i skip. they are all good songs. not amazingly good. but good. which is quite suprising out of a Mariah album. they usually come so wishy washy that you wear out one or two tracks.This record for sure, will go down as a Carey classic. an hour of pure enjoyment, trust me, no one can go wrong with this one."
1,She sprinkles BAD music. She is not glitterous!,"I do not think this cd is ANY good. My friend and I were listening to it and I thought it was the WORST cd I have EVER heard of. I think Britney is MUCH better than Mariah. It is also a humiliating movie. She stinks in it. She can NOT act. She does have a good voice, I always have to use ear plugs everytime she sings a high not. She screams it. It is SOOOOOOO annoying! Sorry! I give this cd 1 star."
5,Pot of Gold,"Glitter is mostly pure 80's pop and it will make you want to get up and dance. Ballads like Lead The Way, Reflections, and Never Too Far will take your breath away. This is one of mariah best work she has done since her platinum album ""Butterfly."" This is an album must have. 5 stars"
4,Glitter really glitters!,"The album is great. Although I like her older albums more, especially Daydream. But she's still the queen of ballads. I don't like Loverboy, Want You and Didn't Mean To Turn You on so much. Don't stop and Last Night a DJ Saved my Life both have nice beat to it and melody. I wish she would sing a little more, like in her full voice. Never Too Far, Lead The Way and Reflection are pretty good too. Given that it's a soundtrack, I don't think it could have be much better anyway."
4,mariah as billie,"""glitter"" is more of a soundtrack to the up coming film (of the same name) than a new mariah album. on ""glitter"" mariah sounds like she's been taken over by her movie character billie. it's no surprise that ""glitter"" is set in the 80's funky pop/r&b sound and production to complement the film. all that being said, ""glitter"" is a great cd. mariah is in top vocal form though out the entire cd and the guest appearances by other artist adds to it. ""glitter"" shines but don't expect it to be a follow up to ""rainbow."""
1,This is Mariah's worst work ever...,"I have been a Mariah Carey fan for a long while, and I can honestly say this is the worst piece of garbage she's ever produced. It seems she can't decide what she wants to do with her music any more.Mariah has one of the most incredible voices ever to sing, and generally, I'd listen to her sing her checkbook just to hear that angelic voice.This disc grossly underrates her tallents. She shouldn't be bogging herself down with rap artists and the like. Rather than running to what is a ""hip"" or ""current"" (J-Lo, Destiny's Child, etc.) sound just for the sake of being hip, I'd rather hear her pushing new musical ground and strething her sound like Madonna or Kylie Minogue.Mariah baby! Please!! Stop hiding behind the rap and urban sound. It's uninspired, it's boring and IT'S NOT YOU!!"
1,"ugh, give it up already","Whyyyy does she keep putting out more ...?? She should've given it up when she got divorced cuz that's when her music went on a fast downhill. And who cares about her emotional problems, everyone has them!! Why is she so special??? It's nice to know she's somewhat human...& about time she realized the whole world doesn't totally revolve around her either (or will she ever realize that). Mariah, stop catering to the teeny boppers, you're in your 30's for Godsake...& STOP DRESSING LIKE A ...!!!!"
1,Glitter...Give me a break,"This is the worst album that Mariah Carey has ever made. I don't know what is happening in her life, but I found this album horrible. I am one of those fans, who purchase MC's albums on the first day and I did so with this album. I was shock and really mad when I listen to this album. I can't believe this is the same woman that made Vision of Love and Dreamlover into classic. The bottom line is this, her debut album was her highest point and this album is her lowest point. Let's hope it can't get any lower in the future."
4,Better Priced,Bought this book at first from a local bookstore. Found it on Amazon at half the price. Bought from Amazon and returned the other copy.
4,a Groove,this ALbum Grooves from Start to finish it's one of those hidden Gem Albums that you gotta hear.I'm glad that it became available again i heard it a long time ago.it still has feeling&Groove to it.
5,Philadelphia Sound!!,My daughter told me about this CD in April. For a while I thought I wasn't going to be able to get it. It was well worth the wait. Amazon always comes through!!
4,Handy!,"I recently purchased this item, which is published by Cold Spring Harbour Press. It is concise and easy to understand. I recommend it."
3,Good Book but missing key equations.,"At first glance this book seemed like it would be really helpful. It has a very good diagram of dilutions and a good explanation of pH and solutions. However, there is no section on commonly used equations like osmolality and creatinine clearance. I thought this book was geared more towards the medical technologist because it does have a good hematology math section. But I was disapointed. Luckily I don't mind writing in my books."
1,old and dry,many of these turned out to be dry. even though they have not expired. I wouldn't buy this again from the site.
1,Disappointed,"I tried figuring out how to use this with the included instructions, and either it is broken, or it just doesn't work with bike tires. I had it connected and as I pumped air a part started coming out- making almost impossible to get air into the tires."
1,What a waste.,"I agree with previous statements the only positive thing about this pump is it looks great mounted on your bike. Otherwise, it's completely useless as a tire pump. The only switch working is the needle for balls. I chucked it in the garbage today after a half hour trying to open up the tire valve switch to inflate my tire."
1,This is Schwinn Quality?,"I purchased my Schwinn Airdriver 700 this afternoon. Upon arriving home I rolled out my bike, locked the pump head onto the valve stem and began to inflate my tire. After about 25 good pumps suddenly the end broke off from the cap that holds the reversible head in place and the head popped out of the pump. Near as I can tell that plastic cap was designed to use as little plastic as possible, and looks about as thick as the wall on a milk jug. My last mini tire pump endured over five years of hard use, this one did not make past one tire. Tomorrow I head back to the store with my pump and my receipt to see about a refund."
2,Not great for bicycles,May be for footballs. Not great for bicycle pumping. Too small and that is why takes too much effort to pump even a small amount.
2,"Looks good, plays so-so","I don't know what the big hoop-te-doo is about Clayton designer guitar picks. High quality graphics are great to look at but I've not had any clayton guitar picks that worked all that well.I guess they are cool to show off to people . . hey I play guitar check out my cool picks , LoLI wouldn't buy these again, even if I ran out of other options. They kinda suck."
2,Poorly made product,"I thought that Clayton picks would be of quality. The picks look NOTHING like the picture. It looks to be a 2 color job of yellow and black and the printing is faded. 50mm? I don't think so, they are slightly thicker than my Fender thins. Every pick in my bag has a strong bend in them! They re almost unusable. Stay away and stick to Fender and Dunlop."
2,Should have been better...,"Occasionally amusing descriptions of confused upper middle class suburbanites and their conflicted attitudes toward careers and parenting can't salvage this novel. The dialogue (especially that of the children) was awfully stilted, the plot was extremely slight, and the ending was completely predictable. Worst of all, the dust jacket summary gave away (before I even started to read) a very pivotal plot element that wasn't revealed until page 176 of a 270 page book."
3,Good read,"I did enjoy this Westchester-based book. It was funny, irreverant, and a fast, summer read. While the husband and wife were fairly believable, some of their actions (like buying a toy gun for their daughter) were a bit of a stretch. It was fast paced and interesting and the details were spot on. What amazed me was the number of typos even by page 20. Where were the editors?"
2,Suburban angst poorly rendered,"Stuart Cross, pushing 60, is a senior editor for a small New York publisher. He's married to Andie, nearly 30 years his junior and movie critic for the New York Post. They move to the country for the sake of their two girls and hire Louise Washington, the perfect nanny.Stuart, although he's been in publishing for 30 years, seems to know very little about it. Andie, although she's been a mother for nine years, knows little about that and is plagued by guilt that she's leaving her girls with a stranger to pursue her career.Various complications ensue, none of which paint the leading characters in a positive light.The best parts of this book are the author's somewhat amusing, though repetitive, musings about suburban life. But the plot is predictable, the writing terribly pedestrian and the characters thoroughly unlikeable."
1,The Good Nanny is a Bad Book,"Oh, yuck! I couldn't wait to finish listening to the cd's as I used this book to fill time on my daily commute. The framework is so bare, I think a skeleton has more going for it. For instance, each chapter heading was from a line at the end of the chapter, word for word. In another part, Stuart takes a bite of food, chews it and swallows. Yeah? Isn't that what you normally do? Why write it? The kids didn't sound right, either. One sounded like a miniature adult and the other like a three year old, although she was suppose to be older.However, the premise was interesting. With a bit more flesh on this skeleton (and some really good editing?) this would be a very fine book. And thanks for talking a bit about the money side of the book trade too."
4,Guaranteed to Make you vote for a tax on large estates,"A neoconservative take on The Nanny Papers. If you found the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina hysterical you'll roll on the floor laughing. Still, a read is recommended if only because you'll be sure to vote for a tax on large estates afterward."
5,The Kestrel was a great all around book,"Theo goes to war on Justins army, while at the same time Mickle leads a band of warriors t hold the Regians off. Soon in a battle Stock does not return, that makes Theo angry.He soon takes off his anger by killing the regians. Soon he becomes known as the Kestrel a bloodthirsty Cuthroat. He battle the regians.The Swamprats go to war after Keller and catch themselves a King while all this is happening. It was a great book and it deserves a 5 star rating"
2,Silly Silly Silly,"I love humorous and witty novels, but this one was just too silly and contrived for my taste. I made it about 3/4 of the way through, but when a swarm of a hundred flying witches (on broom sticks no less) descended on the castle I just gave up and closed the book."
3,cute but a bit silly......,"this was my first Sandra Hill book. I had heard that her books were comedic so I had high hopes for this book. I was mildly disappointed.Overall, it was a cute story. It kept me mostly entertained, although I had to pretty much force myself through the last 100 pages as the storyline got VERY silly to downright stupid. Two things would have made be give this book a higher rating. First, the issue with Maire's son should have been concluded a lot sooner in the story, and the heroine's failure to do so really brought her character down in favor to me. Finally, too much comedy, not the right balance with the serious and dramatic, and the comedy was more sophomoric than clever.If you've never read one of this author's books, be forewarned-there is a lot of sex, and very explicit. While not a problem for me, it may be an issue for some.Overall, an OK romance that while I wouldn't recommend, I'll certainly try another of this author's books to see if she improves.2.5 stars."
1,Not for Large Cats,"I have a cat, Loki, who used to enjoy going outside, but he would sometimes get easily distracted and want to chase after anything that moves. I used to have a nice cat harness, this is not like it. Like the other reviewer said, a cat can slip out of it if he/she tries. Luckily, Loki didn't attempt that. My issue was that the harness just didn't fit him. All three of my cats are larger then what most people picture when they think ""cat"", but only one is overweight. Loki is just too big for the harness. I still was able to use it by extending the part that goes around the waist using an old collar, but no matter what, it is not a secure harness. There are better ones out there. Unfortunately for Loki, we moved, so he hates going outside now that we live in the city."
5,"The best book out there in ""oil production""",Muscat was the forefront of oil production theory. This book is a MUST for all that had a need for this very technical and imperative information.
2,Great Movie,I Liked this movie but it had to many stero types. Me as a Native Indian it really bugged me. There are some Native Indians who are drunks but not alot. I liked it but not the stero types.
3,very good family film,my husband and i both thought the movie to be very heart warming. it was an exceptional down to earth type real life portrayal of some of the way things were in that era. we do not feel it degraded the native americans in any way quite the opposite in our opinion.
3,Good instruction but does not work in all DVD players,This DVD did not work in my computer DVD player (I tried both Mac and PC) but it did work in my Smasung player. Good basic instruction.
2,Not Impressed,"Bought the DLink after reviewing several options to turn my home computer's hard wired connection into wireless. Computer is less than 15' from the Linksys router, no walls in between, I get 100% signal (from the same location) on my Dell laptop, but only 35-50% on the computer with this card. Initial response from DLink support was disappointing, they suggested I try the card in another computer. Starting to regret this purchase."
2,Range did not improve,My desktop had a older LinkSys 802.11b PCI card installed and the reception strength was very low from my office area. I decided to buy this card and upgrade the speed and hopefully gain better range and reception. Didn't work out. This card constantly disconnected and the reception was worse that the old Linksys.I sent it back.
5,XP SP3 works great,"I'm not sure what the environment is that other people are using. I have a Dell 8250 (older tower) running Windows XP Home with SP3. I had bad luck with a different model card so I was leery of this one and did not install all of their software. My steps were:1. Create system restore point2. Download the latest drivers from the D-Link web site (version 1.20 at http://www.dlink.com/products/support.asp?pid=471) as I write.3. Shut off the computer, install the card, turn the computer back on.4. At the new hardware wizard, point to the downloaded drivers.5. Watch everything work well!It saw my wireless network running with WPA2 right away and connected. I'm getting great speed, and no CPU issues."
5,This thing is great!!!,This thing just works. I have combined it with the D-link 2310 Rangebooster G router and get up to 108Mbps speed for the same money as other 54Mbps router/card combinations. Noticed a huge difference in download speeds over my wireless a/b combo. Excellent for my online games.Would highly recommend.
3,"Good signal, no overclock","Similar to a previous review, initially my WDA-2320 was hogging 10-30% of my CPU cycles with deferred procedure calls (DPCs) and hardware interrupts. After removing a sound card that shared the same IRQ, the problem remained. I eventually discovered that the problem was due to my increasing the PCI bus speed via an overclocked FSB. With the PCI bus running at 70 instead of 66MHz the card would hog the CPU. Set at base 66MHz the card functions fine. Kind of a PITA but what can you do. Next time I will just wait for a few days and order a real card from Newegg rather than the local BB. Hope this helps someone out there!"
4,Wireless issues gone,"I bought this adapter to replace a Linksys WMP54G one, since it was having some issues with constant transfers (downloading big files or gaming). This D-Link adapter has cured all of it, however, I find it very strange (and disappointing), that being a ""Rangebooster"" device, it decreased the signal strength instead of boosting it. So, to sum it all up:Old Linksys device: constant transfer issues, ""Excellent"" signal.New D-link device: perfect transfers, no more hiccups, ""Average"" signal.It isn't causing any issues at all, so it doesn't bother me that much. Recommended product."
4,Learning Curve!,"Hey it's great that jamie aebersold included this title in the series. But, hey, it's difficult stuff. I have been working through the JA material for a few years, I'm getting to be quite a good straight-ahead jazz player, but the concepts in the Brecker Brothers material are really out there. Why? unlike regular jazz materials, there are few indentifiable - to me, anyway - cadences, turnarounds, passages, scales....its all polychords, like one chord over another, and very tight fusion rythms. It's fantastic material but you gotta be on the wavelength and it takes some doing....If you're an advanced fusion artist, you could rip through it, but otherwise...be prepared to put in some serious hours....."
5,"I've been wanting this book, with the illustrations, for years. Thank you.",I only recently have purchased used books through Amazon but when I realized that I could get books such as The Goblin Under the Stairs by Mary Calhous used from a reliable vendor I was thrilled. And I remain so.
2,errrrr,"""All the Power"" is confusing. It's semi-biographical and semi-activism information. Written by Mark Anderson, a classic punk, it should be good, right? Right?Wrong.The problem with this book is that it's just too boring. And by boring I mean I rather put a bullet in my face than even think about trying to get through this again."
2,Just OK,"I've been trying out lots of different harmonicas recently, which has given me a great opportunity to compare them all. This Special 20 was the first I tried. I found it perfectly fine at first, until I started trying other models. Now, I find it to be very ""stiff"", and some notes are difficult to play, but are easy on other harmonicas. Also, notes seem to get stuck more easily. I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,Great stuff from the past,"These types of movies, even with low budgets were made to stir ourimagination as they lacked the special effects of today. But seeing itin the 70's it sure was good...and is still good, cause it has John Agar,and the script was interesting. The miniatures were decent and did a goodjob of stirring our imagination. The VHS version has a great cover.As others would say...one of the hight points is the song that wasincluded for the end credits... a must have for classic science fiction."
5,A Side Splitter!,"After all these years, this comedy routine ranks as my all time favorite. Though dated, it easily stands the test of time, with Tomlin at her very best. My personal favorite is her dialogue with ""Miss J as in Joan, Joan Crawford"". It never fails to get me going. If you like good, old fashioned, non-vulgar comedy, this is a must have item. Tomlin never disappoints."
5,Early Lily Tomlin is hilarious!,"I have loved ""This is a recording"" since it first came out in the 1970's. Bought the vinyl album and had lost it over the years. I was thrilled to find it in CD version on Amazon. Lily Tomlin as ""Ernestine"" is hysterically funny and I remember her from when she played the same character on Rowan & Martin's Laugh In. Want a belly-bouncing laugh? Listen to Lily!"
3,"Okay, but not as expected","Received in a timely fashion, but not received as expected or as I understood the description. The case was cracked and there were finger prints and couple fine scratches on the surface of the C.D. Fortunately, it played okay, so decided not to pursue returning it."
4,"A crisp, business-like good afternoon!","I remember hearing this on a vinyl LP when I was too young to be listening to much of it. But even at that young age the thing that tickled me the most about Lily Tomlin's wonderful performance was simply that squeaky, nasal operator voice, at once so familiar and yet also so unique!Another thing that strikes me about Lily Tomlin's role is that she seems to possess a great deal of knowledge of the telephone operator profession and persona. My only complaint is that I wish the album were more family-friendly. Some of the humor is a little on the PG-13 side of things. However, I realize it's still remarkably tame compared to most of the comedy put out nowadays."
3,"Well made, but expands a lot, causing a small amount of discomfort...","This holster is my every-day carry holster, and works pretty well for it. However, I have noticed a couple of things that should be noted for a prospective buyer:- Your weapon will be an extremely tight fit for the first couple weeks you use it. Drawing will take a bit of extra effort, so please watch your safety when unholstering.- As time progresses, the leather expands quite a bit. The weapon will fit properly and become easy to draw. However, the effectiveness of the thumb break will dimish a bit as it continues to expand.- As a direct result of the stretching, I have noticed that when the thumb break ceases to be snug when fastened, it the metal plate supporting the snap can dig into your side a bit when sitting. Not painfully so, but enough to cause discomfort. I don't notice this when standing/walking.All in all this is a good product for the price."
2,Same as $125.99 B00005BNID,"This appears to be the same as item B00005BNID. Both items have 1,300 pieces. That item has 3 reviews and costs $125.99 new, about $375 less.Perhaps the price on this item is a misprint. Reviews are favorable on the $125.99 Mega Bloks Steam Locomotive ASIN: B00005BNID"
1,doens'nt work as advertised,not waterproof after it smeared. very disappointing product. will use it up just to get my money's worth
1,eyeliner,not really smear proof. maybe because i have allergies to most make up. my tears smeared the liner as soon as i put it on.
1,Scary Politics,"I picked this book up expecting to read ghost stories. Instead, we got her political agenda and complaints about the Utah culture. Several things stated as fact were historically inaccurate (i.e. Snow College was named for Erastus Snow, not Lorenzo Snow). In the section on the Salt Lake Tribune and Lamb's Cafe building, there was a three page diatribe on the conflict between the Deseret News and the Salt Lake Tribune before she even got to the ghostly encounters and they weren't even related to the newspapers. If you want to read a good ghost story book pick up ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"". It is as accurate as this book is while being more entertaining."
4,Ghosts plus interesting historical anecdotes...,"The book is a great combination of ghost stories and wonderful anecdotes of Utah history. Though I grew up in Utah, I hadn't heard most of the book's ghost stories and was fascinated with the history I learned reading it. The book is well researched and written in a very readable style. I found it balanced and thorough - and fun to read!"
1,Very disappointed,"I was excited to find this book as I am interested in hauntings and I grew up in Salt Lake and am familiar with several of the sites mentioned in the book; however, the author seems more intent on bashing the Mormon church in general and men in particular then in presenting substantial evidense of haunting. I noticed several mistakes regarding historical facts and place names. The book is poorly researched and poorly written. The book was too boring to finish. Not recommended. I find it interesting that the author appears to have reviewed her own book (5 stars no doubt)!!"
2,Two Tone Cufflinks,"These cufflinks may look very nice from the picture, but when I recieved them I was a bit disappointed. They feel really light in weight and cheap. Also, the ""knot"" is kind of pointless because it looks more like a round circle on top with an empty hole in the middle. If you just want to buy these to add to your collection, go ahead. But if this is a gift for a special someone, I would look for something else with far better quality."
4,my dreams comes true,"Justlike my dream comes true .... my own house ... nobody tells me what to do ...... my own rules ..... no exact time for work ... sleep ...etc i love it, i adore it ... even she's to naughty sometimes but it's lovely"
3,Pippi Longstocking,"It was one of my favorite book when I was a little girl.Pippi is darling, funny,and adventorous!I still love to read the story to myself."
5,My daughter loves reading now,"When my Danish sister-in-law gave my four-year-old daughter Pippi Longstocking, I was shocked. My daughter did not like to read, and giving a four-year-old a chapter book seemed ambitious even for a child who adored books.What I discovered is that my daughter did not like to read because I had been choosing for her the wrong stories. At four, she was ready for more ambitious reading, yet I was still offering her picture books.My daughter loves reading now. She adores Pippi. The trilogy is perfect children's literature."
5,Need A Friend? Pippi Longstocking will fill the position!,"As one of those ""picked on"" children, books were just about my only friends! Discovering the Pippi Longstocking books made alone time, less lonely! She is, and always will be, the ultimate best friend! Funny, adventurous, and always just a page flip away! Now as an adult, when the blues creep in, Pippi can still bring a smile! These books are timeless classics that everyone should experience!"
4,CD remastering problems,"These are great songs, no doubt, but somehow something got lost in the mix to CD. You Really Got Me and I Need You especially lose the original punch they had on vinyl. I don't know what it is, but they just sound thinner and less exciting on CD. Maybe too ""clean,"" even. Other than that, great stuff. I'm glad they at least kept it in mono."
4,A Kinks Starter Kit,"This CD is a definite must if you don't know a lot about the Kinks, but know that you like ""You Really Got Me,"" or ""All Day And All Of The Night."" Going beyond those two songs this CD expands on the Davies genious and gives you a glimpse of why they actually are credited as helping start the punk movement nearly a decade later. Yet other songs stick to the pop ballad formula of the 60's British Invasion. If you buy this CD with the belief this is all the Kinks had to offer you are WRONG. This CD is merely a stepping stone for those unfamiliar with the KINKS. I would have given this CD 5 stars for the music, but due to the recording quality... something that was out of their control due to contracts and copyright ownership in the 80s, I gave it a 4. Not a bad recording, but their remastered stuff is far better. Sad to say this recording label hasn't done so yet. Still it's a must!"
5,"The Kinks, Greatest Hits",Wow! Brought me right back! These songs are really the best of their early stuff! A must have for Kinks fans.
4,You Do Something To Me,"For whatever reason, original Kinks LPs are increasingly hard to find. Best Of/Greatest Hits compilations are getting to be few and far between as well--grab this one and KINK KRONIKLES asap.Some of the tunes on this CD have been played to death on oldies radio, but much of the early stuff--especially ""All Day And All Of The Night""--are so great they overcome radio programmer dysfunction with flying colors.""You Do Something To Me"" is one of the catchiest things to never chart in the US. Sounds like a second single from the O-Needers. Oops--I mean the Wonders.There's a series of singles, from what was once considered the Kinks middle period but must now be called they're late-early period (?), including ""A Well Respected Man,"" ""Stop Your Sobbing,"" ""Dedicated Follower Of Fashion,"" and ""Sunny Afternoon,"" which are among the greatest songs of their time. Too bad the Kinks were labeled ""too English"" by block-headed American radio programmers of the day."
5,Where is Volume 2?,"The best compilation out there capturing the Kinks in their early manic singles heyday...just before their emergence as ""serious"" songwriters and their turn into one of the greatest album bands ever..great package,hard to find now but great for the casual listener and those Kink heads...Rhino quality like always is there."
4,A WONDERFUL COLLECTION...RELEVANT THEN...RELEVANT NOW,"Having loved the Kinks as a young teenager in the mid nineteen sixties, I was delighted to find this CD. Even though most of the music on this album is a quarter of a century old, it is still relevant today, with its distinctive rhythms and highly stylized vocals which always let the listener know that it had to be The Kinks to whom they were listening.While many of these songs were a part of the British invasion in the wake of the Beatles' success, there the comparison should end, because these were the bad boys of rock with their thought provoking lyrics and rage at class divisions. They were precursors for what was to come down the pike in terms of music. They set the standard for punk and techno-rock rhythms.While some critics say that the later Kinks were much better, that may be so, but without the success of this early music by The Kinks, there would have been no later music. This is a CD well worth having."
2,generally a disappointment,This could have been a great CD. One of the most beautiful arias sung by the greats and not so greats. It is definitely worth it for the cut by Jussi Bjorling. But most of the rest sound like they were taken directly off of old 78's. You can even hear the uneven slipping. There are many wonderful versions of Di Stefano singing Che gelida manina - this isn't one of them.
1,no help for adults,I ordered this book for an adult self esteem therapy group. I found maybe 10 exercises that were for adults. The majority of the material is activities that a parent does with child to boost self esteem and growth.
3,Is not great but it helps!,Is not a definitive solution but it definitelly helps... I am waiting to see the results on the long time...
4,Really works,the Hair growth is slowed and works like products costing much more money. We use this product with the no no.
3,I miss Jergens Naturally Smooth,"Doesn't work as well as Jergens naturally smooth did. It takes longer to rub in (although it's not impossible) and sometimes can leave a white residue. I usually use it on the days I'm wearing pants or at night if I put it on my legs. It has an off smell. Overall though, the product seems to work as described."
3,SCALED REPLICA,This item description should specify that this is not a full scale replica but one one Master Replicas scaled replicas. .45 scale I believe.
5,smokin!!,I love breaks and I LOVE Vytear!! I have been following this music for years and he is an undiscovered gem. Do yerself a favor and pick up this rockin banger.peaceQulfus T. Jones
2,Cheap,These thing fell apart almost right away. What ever happened to swabs that could be used over and over again
2,"How To Stubbornly Refuse To Make Yourself Miserable About Anything, yes, Anything. By Albert Ellis",For an E Reader I don't like this because the format of How to Stubbornly Refuse.......... does not adapt to the e-book format. There are essential charts and forms that are totally useless because I could not read them. My Kindle Paperwhite 3G's ability to change font size does not work on those special pages.If you want How to Stubbornly Refuse......buy the hard copy.It is worth noting that my counselor recommended The Brain Mechanic by Spencer Lord as an easier to understand book.Nancy
2,Hyperbole for sure,"The one thing the reader should know before reading is that Albert Ellis is/was a great salesman who was not afraid to toot his own horn. He seems to me to be more concerned with showing exactly how smart he is (his thoughts are often correct)than with actually wanting to help anyone. But this is just one reader's view, and not necessarily everyone's. Come on, Dr. Ellis, please admit that there are some miserable situations in life!"
1,How to be Miserable after a book purchase.,"I purchased this book on the strength of the reputation of its author, Albert Ellis. This was a mistake as Mr. Ellis apparently dashed this off on his way out the door. I suppose when one has written many books, particularly on one subject, re-iteration eventually becomes one giant summary-which this book is. This is a throw away. Both for the author and the reader. I'm looking at it now on my bookshelf, lamenting the waste of money and time. Mr. Ellis probably regrets the time but not the money. If you are seeking an alternate view of reality, and who isn't, check out David Burns, ""Feeling Good"". Much more substantive and not a gloss over."
5,Classic Ellis,This book is classic Albert Ellis. I followed the advice he gives in the book and it works for me. If you want to blame others for everything (universal qualifier) in life then you will always get the same thing. Thinking about thinking is one of the fine qualities of higher order learning. Stop focusing on the all of the offensive people you encounter through the day and on what can be done about how it makes you feel. You are the ONLY ONE WHO IS IN CONTROL OF YOUR FEELINGS. The task of this book is not in understanding the ABC's of REBT. It's the work that follows.
4,Accessable and Effective,"To put it bluntly, the techniques described in the book work... period! You can't say that about most self help books. You definitely don't need a therapist to garner a huge amount of benefit from the trivial sum you'll have to pay for the book. That said, the techniques only work as well as the effort put in to implement them.The book is written in a way that's understandable to any reader.I do prefer the work of David Burns on CBT because it is more comprehensive and is better written. I'd recommend Feeling Good..the New Mood Therapy over this one."
3,Good advice ... writing style could have been better.,"The advice is good enough--one wouldn't go astray following it. However, I found the writing style somewhat cumbersome."
4,"Almost A ""Must"" For REBT Users.","This book is another valuable addition to the REBT literature. This work by Ellis stresses the importance of using the scientific method to ged rid of self-defeating negative emotions. The way you do this is to find the thoughts that you are harassing yourself with and set them up as a hypothesis. You then vigorously question the validity of your hypotheses. Invariably, if you stick with it long enough you will find that the thoughts behind your inappropriate emotions: 1. Do not conform to reality. 2. Are illogical--e.g., just because you want something it doesn't follow that you should or must get it. And 3. Are self-defeating--that is they make you get more of what you don't want and less of what you do want. This is a fine, hard-headed, practical book to use to improve your life."
3,"Good, but a bit too much","I really enjoyed the book. It is very informative and an excellent primer on REBT psychology. Ellis is courageous and daring in his convictions and by the end of the first three chapters you are as convinced as he is. The problem is after the first three chapters you really don't need the book. It becomes long and perhaps overdrawn, in the way an ideologue drives his point home through constant reiteration. Maybe that's the power of the book-- the repetition. All in all this is a worthy self-help book."
5,excellent analysis of terrorism financing,"Loretta Napoleoni is the world's expert on terrorism financing. She is very well known in Europe as the sole writer who has explained the international economic system created by armed organizations since the end of WWII.I have just attented one of her lectures in San Francisco and was amazed at her knowledge and undersanding of the phenomenon.I think her book should be a required reading for anybody who wants to know the truth about the world we live in.The book is fascinating, written like a thriller will have the reader stay up all night turning the pages.Well done and congratulation,Richard"
3,OK for the Price,This story was good for a dull weekend but not as good as other stories in the series. In fact the details are fading from my mind as I type.
2,Lots of editing problems,"Bought the book day before yesterday and finished it this morning. I wish I'd read the other reviews first. It's still full of the same errors listed in 2011. 1's instead of l's, Til instead of I'll, sentences stopping in the middle, paragraph's out of place. It's readable, but just barely. Very disappointed."
4,"A fascinating world, but a bit bare on plot.","Hoover is an excellent writer; the world she has built could supply the background for a novel several times the length. Unfortunately, the plot never quite comes together; events seem to occur with the main character an observer rather than an actor."
5,Excellent for first foray into home theater!,"Like most people, I researched many product before making the Acoustic Research HD510 my choice. It was a clear winner in my mind for several reason:1. Great value for the money.2. Acoustic Research is an recognized name in sound equipment3. High quality materials, and4. easy setup.You need a receiver to connect this to, but you will not be disappointed. We love it! I put it in the master bedroom and we really enjoy the way it enhances our room."
4,amazing satellite speakers,"Quality at an affordable price. The satellite speakers are crisp and clear. The subwoofer however came damaged and Tiger electronics refused to make it right, shame on them! The sound makes both games and movies come alive. No need to spend 10 dollars a ticket at the movies anymore. Im currently using the satellites with a previous sub, cant imagine how good the sound would be if Tiger actually shipped a subwoofer that worked. Overall, a great value not to be missed."
4,Sounds of Music Pleasure,I agree with most people when it comes to buying a product before you get a chance to test it out to see if it fits your needs. Well I didn't need to worry with this Stereo Speaker System. Acoustic Research has always been a brand known for making speakers that give justice to sound reproduction. The base just thumps and is very smooth. I didn't have to worry about some of my favorite musicians sounding like they were amateurs because of the quality of the speakers. The listening experience for me is detailed. I try and pick up on subtle variations in the talents of the musicians and you only do this if you have speakers that fully recreate what the artist had in mind when good music is put out to be accepted by a discerning public. These speakers will bring me joy for years and I couldn't be more satisfied.
5,Beautiful And Mesmerizing!,"The clarinets sound great, but what really got me on this piece was the memories it brought back. My father was a music teacher, and gave private lessons every Saturday morning. I used to wake up hearing this song, along with many other clarinet duets that came from either the Rubank or Lazarus method books(wish I could find recordings of these!) This particular piece is beautiful to begin with, and the way the instruments work together in this is mesmerizing."
4,Used books,"Bought ""Every shot must have a purpose"" as a used book. Condition was exactly as described. Wanted hard copy because it will be a useful reference book, but didn't want to pay for a new hardback. Got just what I wanted."
3,text to talk not enabled,"Interested in this book in the kindle format. But without audio enabled - I will not buy. I like to read and then when I get into the car switch to audio mode. I'm not going to buy the book twice, in fact I'm not going to buy it once."
3,every shot must have a purpose,helps one to focus of the importance of thinking about the importance of every shot when playing golf
5,A Sports (Golf) Psychologist's Review,"Pia and Lynn's book, Every Shot Must Have a Purpose, is a must read for those interested in improving their mental game in golf. I have studied almost every book on the topic and this is, by far, the best to date. I am providing my students with a copy before starting their training. I use the HeartMath biofeedback technology, as well as Bobby Foster's Mental Golf Profile which are highlighted in the book. Well organized, to the point, and practical strategies for immediate benefits. This is not wasted academic theory, or sports-psychobabble...it is the real deal."
4,Common sence,An interesting book which made sence.I had very high expectations when buying the book and it didn't quite measure up to them.
1,Buy Kaplan's MCAT Review instead.,"I hate to say this because I'm currently trying to sell my copy of this book on Amazon, but this book was not very helpful. Like the last review says, it's really just an outline with a few sample questions. Even the sample questions were nothing like what I just took, and the explanations of the answers were too brief to be helpful. There was a lot of BS about preparation and test taking strategies which was all common sense. It really seems like this book was just thrown together to make some money, not to help students. The MCAT Review book, on the other hand, was very helpful. I didn't even look at the sample questions, but I read over the organic chemistry sections the night before the OAT, and the organic part of the OAT was a breeze. I also used it last semester to study for my Chemistry final, which I aced! Obviously since it's not made for the OAT, some parts were irrelevant, but it was worth the buy."
2,Cheap plot to get them more money,"Well, the book does have information in it that can be useful. But what gets me is that the cover explicitly says 2001 OAT prep, but as soon as you open the front cover you see that they have just put a new cover on the 2000 edition. Even the dates that are listed in there were incorrect. The test questions were OK, but upon cross referencing with my other study materials, i found that every single problem in the book was also listed in the MCAT prep guide from a few years ago, and the MCAT book gave explanations to the solutions while this book did not. Bottom line - If you have nothing else to use, this book is OK. If you're serious, get other books which have better explanations for problems and give better background on the material."
4,Laugh-out loud funny and some jamming music,"One of the funniest albums I've ever heard. Cheerfully moronic lyrics and some very good music. The guitarist, especially, is very good on the song I Am A Doctor and Strangulation. The drumming is very impressive and keeps a tight, solid beat on Responsibility, Hey, The Mouth Won't Stop and others. The lunkheaded earnestness of the vocals combined with the willfully stupid and offensive lyrics is laugh-out-loud funny, something which few albums can accomplish. Especially funny are the title track, Have a Beer With Fear, Bomb The Russians, the vocals on Strangulation (which has some willfully stupid, misogynist lyrics) and I Am A Doctor. The way the lead vocalist sings ""let's make love"" on the latter song is worth buying the album. The last few songs kind of peter out, but overall a very fun album."
3,its ok,"Its not the best punk album ive ever bought, but it was worth the 2 bucks i payed for it on vinyl. Some of it sounds too metal to be enjoyed but alot is good. Like the opening track. ""hey"" is a cool song."
4,question?,"My copy of this CD has the song ""strangulation"" on it but it doesn't list the song on the back cover or the sleeve. The cover does list ""living in the city"" and ""now you're dead"" but those songs aren't on the CD. Can anyone clear up this for me? As for the CD itself, it is pretty damn good, if not as good as the record. The booka matches song gets pretty old, though."
3,Punk Is Dead!!!,"Sexist, Racist, Politically Suicidal! This is Punk Rock the way it was meant to be! Say what you think and everyone knows where you stand. Agree or disagree, you have to admire Lee Ving and Fear's honesty on songs like ""The Trouble Today With Women"" and ""Bomb the Russians."" There are some fun songs on the album as well. Musically, this CD leaves much to be desired. Yet, as a sobering look back at Punk Rock, ""More Beer"" is a valuable educational tool."
4,Direction for Creativity,"After the debut, the band decided to expand their creativity and this album was what slowly began to open the door for this. Dropping the more gritty, bluesy, punk sounds that was found in places on ""Hear It Is"" they adapted Art/Progressive rock and began seriously using atmospheric effects... reverb,echo, acoustic guitars, backward loops, and other sounds from various effects or electric guitar flow about through this album and create textures very new and almost uncompomisingly different from most late '80's indie music, retreating to a psychedelic idealism and experimental attitude. They also were growing longer hair, dressed, and were more refered to as hippies... but for the album... songs of life,love,joy and visions from Wayne Coyne's perception create a great album.Ben.the 15 year old."
5,That Place is Heaven,"I love This bass, Rob Fisher, who lays down a very intense groove, along with the drummer, throughout the CD. The pianist, Jeff Pittson has a unique way of voicing dense left hand chords, that adds a deep, haunting quality to the music. Great jazz!"
3,Lukewarn But Reliable Incidental Mafiosa,"I have read this book twice. Many pages are devoted to the aspirations and self-importance of the main character, Arlyne Weiss Brickman. Naturally, this is the case since the story is told in her words. There isn't a real gripping story here, but it's very interesting to read about her interactions with so many well-known mobsters. It's rare that a woman has any important place in the world of organized crime but her little-known exploits dovetail nicely with accounts I've read about many other mafioso. She provides an almost ""behind-the-scenes"" look at daily life in the underworld. I would love to get a copy of this book to shelve with my others on the topic of organized crime."
4,NEW!,"I am glad that I ordered from Amazon, that book is new and I am thrilled to read it for class and as a future reference guide."
5,This is really good,"This album is great like all the other Mcrackins album. Every song is really good, this is very catchy."
1,A great disappointment,"I bought the 45rpm single of 'Street that rhymes' 40 years ago. This was the first time I had seen the track on a CD so I bought it. My copy had two tracks with such bad dissonance problems that they were unplayable. Unfortunately, one of the these was 'Street that rhymes', which was the only real reason I had to buy the CD.Because of pstal costs being high from where I live - central Europe - to Amazon.com I just threww it in the trash.A great disappointment - and a question as to how it is possible to release a defective CD like this."
3,Walkin' My Cat Named Dog,"The only reason I have for not giving Norma Tanega's album a higher rating is I'm not especially fond of her music. However I remembered, from my post high school years, her song ""Walkin' My Cat Named Dog."" It's kind of a catchy tune/song and since my wife and I were recently acquired/adopted by a stray male tabby cat whose characteristics, antics and general behavior were more like that of a dog than a cat we decided to name him Dog. Since we had become the proud caretakers of a ""Cat Named Dog"" we felt an obligation to acquire Norma Tanega's song about such a cat...our cat, that is."
5,Excellent poetic storytelling!,"Ms. Sanchez paints a picture with her words. The words remind you of yourself, your mom, aunt, grandmother, friend or any woman you know who has experienced love, knows about the effect of drugs on family, lived through American wars, understands the experience and history at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and simply can relate to the African American woman's experience or whoever wants to know about it from one black woman's experience. This book is great reading."
4,An overlooked 70's band who deserves a listen,"I grew up in the era of the 70's arena-rock bands and found the oft-overlooked (Foghat, Head East, Grand Funk, Etc...) the most dynamic and enjoyable. Foghat is/was a band that gave us some great American anthems. They entertained without glitz and enjoyed the hell out of themselves. This CD mirrors this ethic and showcases what made them so incredible. The only down-side that kept me from rating 5 stars was that there were some live renditions of a few of these songs (Fool for the City, Slowride) that show more of what the band was about than the studio version. Aside from that, a fabulous ride back to pure rock and roll."
2,Slow ride prematurely ended just as I was getting warmed up!,Will somebody please tell me where I can get the long version of Slow Ride - the entire reason I bought this album in the first place???!!!
3,Three classic tunes were edited to make room for filler.,"Drivin' Wheel, Stone Blue, and Chateau Lafitte 59 Boogie were all shortened to make room for a few outtakes. Otherwise would have been 5 stars."
4,another addition to my cd collection,i bought this album its pretty much typical 70s classic rock-i have heard maybe 2-3 songs off this album the album is good
2,Was someone at Amazon in the band?,Wasn't Fool for the City just an album of the day? By far their best album and I don't think the compilation adds much.
1,Speaking of bad...,"Foghat caught my attention with their HIT song, ""Slow Ride"". So, I thought to myself, if they have on good song, like other bands, they will have other good songs on their album. This is one of the few times I will admit that I am wrong. And I was wrong in the worst way. I not only wasted my money to buy this album, I wasted my time listening to each of those songs at least once. I would recommend this album to ANYBODY who wants to spend $10 on one good song."
1,Fog Who???,"Heh, heh, heh. I can't believe ANYBODY likes this band. A best of is the most ridiculous title they could come up with, considering these guys have never made a good song. A bad album along The Eagles Hotel California, or anything Floyd ever put out. Avoid these old dinasour and dated bands and concentrate on modern, more exciting and better written music of today!!If you want a real best of.., pick up Kylie Minogues and stop depressing yourself with Foghat.How can you not disrespect music this lousy???!!!!!"
3,"Foghat is great, but this collection has two major flaws.","For the average fan of Foghat, there are three songs in particular that they will buy this collection for. The three songs are, Fool For The City, Slow Ride, and I Just Want To Make Love To You. Unfortunately, both Fool For The City and Slow Ride are NOT the full length albums versions! This is a great disservice to the casual fan who doesn't want to invest in the albums. The shortened versions are simply not as good as the full-length versions, and the shortened versions are NOT the versions that the radio stations play. In order to get these two songs in their proper form, you will, thankfully, only have to purchase the Fool For The City album. But, I thought I'd warn anyone else out there thinking of buying this. Otherwise, this is an ok collection of their best songs.(By the way, is it just me, or does Rhino seem to make a habit of putting shortened versions of hit songs on its compialations and greatest hits cds?)"
3,Where's the rest of SLOW RIDE?,"Did you guys at Rhino think we've never heard it? It's the same as when you hear Light My Fire on some stations that cut it down to a little over 3 minutes. For that reason alone, I had to knock 2 stars off the record, not because of the record itself, but because of Rhino's gaff. You Rhino wizards thought enough to put all those extra tracks on the re-released Yes albums, how did you clowns botch this?"
1,Slow Ride isa total rip-off!,I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this compilation. Nowhere does it say that Slow Ride is the edited version until you break the seal and read page 15. It was extremely irritating to hear it fade out.
1,"""Slow Ride"" is the radio edit version!!!","This would be a decent 'best of' collection, but the one BIG problem is that they included the radio edit version (which is 3:30) of ""Slow Ride."" In fact, I have purchased 3 alleged ""greatest hits"" compilations from Foghat that all have radio edit versions of the song. If you are a die hard Foghat fan, you will only settle for the original album version (which is almost 8:00 minutes long) which can only be found on the ""Fool for the City"" album."
3,"Uh, Rhino?","Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate you putting this thing out. Lord knows These Kids Today, with their rap music and Gothic metal and such, don't appreciate bands as solid as Foghat. And there's great stuff here. ""Drivin' Wheel,"" ""Stone Blue"" and especially ""Chateau Lafitte '59 Boogie."" REALLY love that one and I crank it up a lot. But I've just got one question about this collection, Rhino.WHERE'S THE REST OF ""SLOW RIDE"" YOU IDIOTS?!!"
1,Great in concept; implausible in application,"Ed Marshall takes off on the valuable insights of Deming and others, espousing that managers give more credence to and respect their staff. No one can argue with that. Unfortunately, the book goes overboard. While the concepts are indeed worthy, the book falls short in implementation. If you try to transform corporate culture a la Marshall, you'll spend all your time in committees and find it impossible to make the hard decisions that management alone must make. Having attempted to implement Marshall's doctrines, I found his approach unrealistic. This is great conceptual reading, but leave it on the bookshelf where it belongs. This book is a good example of the dictum: ""those who can't teach."""
1,Those who cant teach,"That is an understatement, This book is the worst excuse for book I have ever seen. This book isent even worthy for kindling. ""Ed Marshel"" Must know knothing about Management let alone 1st Grade grammer. My younger brother has written more decisive pices on doodle-paper"
3,"Some topics are outdated, but still is a good resource","My overall impressions of this book were pretty good. Unfortunately, due to the rapid growth of the technology of paintball equipment, many of the equipment and stratigies covered in this book are no longer valid in regular paintball play. However similar equipment is used in ""stock class"" play, although this is less popular than the use of newer equipment. But many of the overall team stratigies are extremely good and are still valid for any type of play. The illustrations were also very helpful. I would recomend this book for any player who wants to get into stock class play, or anyone who would like to learn more about overall tactics."
5,this book is the best paintball book published,it goes indepth with pictures on do's and dont's for a rookie player and much much more i formed my own team using the guidlines in this book and we use all the tactics. a very good buy
4,"Good overall tactical review, although a bit outdated.","This is a nice book that any paintball player should read. Its major downside is that it is somewhat outdated. It still provides nice insight into essential concepts such as flanking, fields of fire, and paintball psychology."
3,"Good book on tactics, could be more polished.","I found Bill Barnes' tips on starting a team and hints on tactics and how to play different terrain features very informative. The book does have some drawbacks as he recommends the Nelspot 007 as the best gun out there. I do realize that it was written almost 9 years ago, but he would have done a better service to his readers if he didn't mention specific equipment. Worth the price of the book in my opinion. Not for sniper wannabes though."
3,This Book Is Old,This book is very old.Paintball is a sport that is drastecally growing and changing.This book is not up to date because it has got pictures of old guns that are pumps that use 12 Gram CO2 and only hold 10 Paintballs at a time.This book shows that it is ok to where shop goggles instead of face masks.Newbies should not get this book because if you did you would show up at the field looking pretty weird.This book has good diagrams for beginners and good scenarios but it is still stuck back in the 80's when Paintball was first invented.
3,"Old, but still fun to read.","OK so it is really out dated, but I enjoyed reading it. It's not something that would get you ready for your next big tournament, but it has some great ""rec ball"" scenarios."
2,it was ok....,"The book was ok but lacked enough to keep me interested. It kept going over the same old stuff that most paintballers know allready. If yer a newbie who has money to burn and time to waste, get this book."
3,Outdated but not useless,"This book was written back when semi-automatic markers were just beginning to appear, so most of the info is severely dated (unless you are looking to improve your stock-class game). That said, the chapters where Barnes discusses tactics and scenario ideas are still useful. However, the same tactics are also discussed in more modern guides. You would be better served passing this over unless you are going to use it to improve your stock game."
5,A Wolf with Character,"RUNT, like all books by Marion Dane Bauer, tells a gripping story in which the main character, in this case a young wolf, makes one mistake after another and through them learns and grows in character. In this case Runt competes with his siblings to gain a place in his pack and his father's approval as he seeks to show that he is more than just the runt of the litter. His adventures are increasingly harrowing making it difficult to put the book down. I found myself reading late into the night until I was satisfied that Runt would gain a satisfying measure of wisdom and belonging. Bauer is expert at telling tales that intrigue children while dealing with strong psychologicla issues in beautiful language that sinks deep into the reader's heart. Runt illustrates this one more time"
4,I Hope theirs a sequel,"I bought the book online-unaware that the novel was a ""novel"" for a a child in grade 3. Anyways,despite being rather short, the author writes considerably well and descriptive without it getting boring. The storyline is cute and kept me reading to find out what happens to small little runt. This book explores the wolf`s world in a Bambi/Disney style of talking animals intertwined with human beings. It describes the life of a wolf rather well minus the fact that there is one major flaw: the author makes the alpha male the leader when it is in fact the alpha female. other than that, the book is a great intro to the animal world for children. I can easily see it being adapted by Disney for a film."
5,RUNT,This book is great if you like wolves. It has the action and suspense of all the great movies. It has a great ending and beginning. The characters are funny and serious at the same time. This story has some sad moments but all the thrilling exitment makes up for it. If you like wolves and like action read RUNT.
5,One of the best,"Just bought this one used to have one a few years ago let it go with my car This thing brings out the music in a clean crisp way ,cant go wronga little expensive otherwise love it"
5,An Important Angle on the Historic Jesus,"Scholars tend to avoid discussion of Jesus miracles. And Jesus exorcisms are discussed even less. But this book establishes it was a common practice in ancient Judea. A review of Greco-Roman and Middle-Eastern literature on the topic establishes a historical backdrop for the accounts in the Gospels.But Twelfetree makes a more important contribution by using higher-critical tools to validate some of the accounts in the Gospels. From there, he draws a contrast between Jesus method and those of other exorcists from his time. This leaves important clues to Jesus self-understanding and purpose in ministry. I enjoyed this book very much."
4,A Writer to Read,"The series featuring Antonio Burns, a Wyoming Special Agent with the Dept. of Criminal Investigation, can now be categorized as being in the higher echelons of U.S. based crime fiction. All of the novels penned to date are well written, interesting and keep your attention. The series will particularly appeal to people who like the outdoors life, set in mostly rural areas; Burns is a high-altitude rock climber by avocation. In this novel he's charged with protecting a woman being harassed by an unknown stalker, and more or less as usual he alternates between screwing up and acting heroic. For readers of some other books in the series, there's an interesting twist near the end relating to his love life. It will be interesting to see how that plays out in future books. In all, a series worth reading."
4,Opened my eyes to music beyond 3-chord punk...,"I had become a one-dimensional punk monster in the early eighties...Then along came Change Today? As much as I loved the classic TSOL...The new singer/sound sucked me in. The bass-lines haunt me even today...I have the vinyl version still in it's plastic. No one can touch it. I bought the bonus track CD last year. All the originals sound great digitized. I'm not such a big fan of the bonus tracks though. They seem to have been pasted on, and don't really follow the flow of the original album. Cool if you're into collecting rarities I guess.Buy this disc!"
5,"one of my favorite albums, period","TSOL's best album, Change Today, has a close to perfect mix of punk, surf, rockabilly, and hints of thrash or metal that would come after they soon broke up. I can listen to this just about any time of day or night; it's lyrically powerful and works amazingly everytime you listen to it, and the music is catchy while still staying to the hardcore tenets of punk rock. It's just great music that I'd reccomend to just about anyone."
4,The only TSOL album without Grisham to own.,"Change Today? is the first TSOL album without Grisham on vocals. Joe Wood manages to put out some great offerings with good political insights. A few of the songs on this album leave a bit to be desired, but others really shred. I especially enjoy Otherside, American Zone, and Nice Guys. I was quite disappointed in the Revenge album that followed this, as I had high hopes for an album similar to Change Today. After that, came Hit & Run which completely changed the band's style in an attempt to jump on the 80's glam metal bandwagon. Thankfully, Jack Grisham took TSOL back after Wood's third album without him. Even hardline Grisham fans should appreciate Change Today? for what it is; an impressive punk album."
4,Classic Old style skater-punk. Not heavy metal sounding.,"This album has a classic punk sound and is recomended for anyone who likes the older punk without the loud screaming and annoying heavy metal sound. I think that TSOL changed after this album. The sound is similar to the Adicts, if you are familiar with them."
3,4 cool tunes out of 10 ...the rest garbage,"I had never even heard of True Sounds Of Liberty prior to seeing them live at a small Miami club (Griff's?) in 1984. They were touring in support of ""Change Today?"" and they sounded great once I got hammered on beer!...I still have a scar on my arm where something or someone spiked me during a slam session (hell, the whole audience was a ""pit"" in those early days).This release marks the debut of Joe Wood's killer vocals, but the guitar player's knowledge was so limited that most of songs are in the same key and even use the exact same chords...his ""solos"" are so off, I cringe. This band was much more impressive as a creepy live act.""Red Shadows"", ""Just Like Me"" and ""Blackmagic"" and the hit single: ""Flowers by the Door"" are the standouts...the rest are awful and unlistnable.2 and 1/2 stars...rounded up."
1,Piece of Garbage. . .,". . . that's putting it nicely. The CD player - when it works - skips if you even so much as look at it. The sound quality is same as those tin-can string ""telephones"" that we used to make when we were kids. My expectations were pretty low when I ordered it because of the low price, but if I knew then what I know now of this product they couldn't give it to me."
1,UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS!,"If it was at all possible I would give this contraption a rating of ""0"" stars. It worked well the first day, and then as stated in the other reviews promplty went of the fritz. Being an engineer I took it apart to find out if I could see what was wrong. The plastic casing was indeed not waterproof! There was no rubber lining to prevent water from entering and so it promptly shorted out. Not only that, the thing refused to turn off and picked up all sorts of random radio transmission. This piece of junk should be considered illegal for how poorly it works, correction, formerly worked."
1,"Tricky, but crappy","There's another product that looks *almost* like this, but also include a fog-free mirror, more CD features, and better sound quality. Go for that one instead!"
1,Don't waste your money and shipping,"Sound was horrible, scratchy and tinny and it was hard to find a place to hang it."
4,"Basically ""Ace It! IIS4"" with different questions","I just finished writing a review of Iseminger's ""Ace It!"" for the IIS 4.0 exam, and see no reason to repeat that here -- because they are just about the same book. Certain chapters read exactly the same.Not a knock on the book, because it does a good job of covering IIS 4.0 basics. It does not include essential ODBC error information, though. The questions in the Ace It! book do a better job of testing your understanding, in my opinion, but you can't go wrong with either. Just don't buy both!"
4,Lots of heart.,"BIG BAD LOVE takes more chances than a lot of films that have been made in the last several years. It relies a lot on surreal imagery and a fragmentary pacing to convey the messiness of the life of Leon Barlow, full-time writer and wrecked-up vet. Arliss Howard embodies Barlow fully; it's amazing that he was able to both direct and star in this film and to do a great job in both roles (and a third; he co-wrote the script as well). Paul Le Mat, a great actor who should be seen more often onscreen, almost steals the film away from Howard in the part of his best friend Monroe, who suffers a tragic turn of events that ironically partly serves to bring a semblance of balance to Barlow's out-of-kilter life. The whole movie is a finely-wrought stream-of-consciousness tale, with the underlying theme being that people somehow manage to maintain connections with one another despite the body-blows delivered by life. Highly recommended."
5,fiji---the drinkable bottled water,I have tried alot of bottled water and usually go right back to drinking the water from my tap. Fiji is the first bottled water I have tried and will buy it again. It has the taste of refreshing water. The way it should be.
3,Essential Herbs,I am holistic doc. I think it is a great book for the aaverage Joe walking around to keep abreast of what needed....
3,10 Essential Herbs,Not what I expected but has good information to compliment my healthy living library. Can be a good reference book.
4,Herbs for the uninitiated.,A lifetime of herbalism distilled into 10 essentials and one book. I learned a lot and put some of it to use.
1,Book was not Glued together,The book I ordered was not glued all the way. I had to get super glue to glue the cover on. Plus there is supposed to be an order form insert in the book for your own personal Herb Kit and it was not in there. The price was good but the book's cover was not on.
3,10 essential herbs,This book was secoundhand and originally cost $16.95 as printed on back of the book the edition was 1996 and there was a pen (ballpoint)written under lining in the print of some of the pages . I paid $42.50 U.S so i was not happy with the deal.I have not read through the book as yet.seems informative.
5,Love it,Bought this album for my stepdad and he loved old blind dogs. Very decent price for the cd he loves it
2,Outstanding Effort,"I stumbled upon Old Blind Dogs last CD while browsing at Borders and fell in love with it. Fit, their latest CD is every bit as good. I love Celtic music but get a little tired of just jigs and reels and all instumentals. I think the real strength of this band is their outstanding vocals. I highly recommend this CD."
4,Defies the theory that Glass's orchestral works are weak,"I bought this CD simply on impulse (it was on sale for $5.99) but it turned out to be a rewarding purchase. I have always thought of Glass's great works to be his operas and smaller pieces (Glassworks etc.) but the pairing of these two powerful orchestral works makes you wonder if his symphonies are underrated (and certainly underperformed). Alsop creates a unified structure that makes a more compelling case than the previous recording of the 3rd (I don't have any comparison for the 2nd). Bournemouth, as everybody knows, is a fine orchestra, but really shines when Alsop asks them to provide a little more 'oomphh' than is usually called for in Glass works. No serious contemporary collector should miss this set, and at the price I'd buy one for a friend."
4,Superb,"Two months ago I had never heard of this over productive composer! I am totally hooked already. I saw a performance in Amsterdam by a dance group, moving on music of Philip Glass, I did not know what the piece was called, so I just bought this CD to 'try' if this was the one. It wasn't but this music is awesome, true greatness in composing. I guess I'll be buying more of Mr. Glass' mastermind pieces.. BUY THIS CD!"
5,If you want a Modern Symphony look here,"Glass is not Mozart. But if you like Mozart, you probably will like these symphonies of Glass. They have a lot of wind parts for symphony 2. And symphony 3 is unique. Some like classical music for the feelings they carry thru music, and what can you 'feel' thru Glass's music? Strokes of strength on the strings, danger, peril, and victory. The one thing he and Mozart both have in common is that they both did that, albeit in different ways. Glass does his own thing, this is modern stuff that sounds almost akin to what you might hear in a movie. It's a nice change of pace if you ever get burned out on Mozart, or Beethoven or any other 18th century composer."
5,Heifetz Sounding Great.,"It Ain't Necessarily So, But It Is. These recording from the mid 1940's sound great. The performances are of course wonderful, it is the sound quaility that will catch your attention, if you remember when they were recorded. Most CDs of recording from this era either have major noise problems or sound compression. This 2 disc set does not suffer from either of these problems. The team from Deutsche Grammophon and Andrew Wedman at Emil Berliner Studios are to be applauded. These are mono recordings but DO NOT let that stop you from enjoying them."
4,"Great guitar work, nice easy voice.","A wonderful cd that highlights the best in Delta blues. Nice guitar work, smooth vocals and original songs with a respectful nod to the blues tradition. If you like Kelly Joe Phelps or Eric Bibb- check out Paul Brasch!"
4,Beautiful and accessible,"After using a library copy of this book for several weeks, I am definitely purchasing my own copy. It's a beautiful book, yes, but more important, the recipes are easy to use and produce a fairly authentic flavor with little fuss and bother. I have one slight suggestion for future volumes by Andoh and other Japanese cookbook authors. It would be extremely helpful if the names for ingredients (in the ingredient glossary) would be given in both romaji and Japanese characters. When shopping, I often find products that are made in Japan and labeled only in Japanese. Since my reading knowledge of Japanese is extremely limited, it's difficult to figure out what the item is exactly. With hiragana and/or kanji labels in the book, one could compare to the product label and shopping would be far easier!"
2,"Washoku, save your money",Would be a good recipe book if you are Japanese. I dont know what most of the ingredients are or where to buy them.Dont waste your money unless you are asian.
4,Thorough and tasty,"This book starts with an excellent summary of all the ingredients, basic techniques and utensils and then progresses through a series of delicious, reasonably easy and well set-out recipes. I would probably start with doing some recipes and referring back to the beginning when directed, rather than trying to start at the beginning and work through."
2,Deceptively Beautiful,"Just a quick note: I was referred back to 5 different references/recipes from the recipe for a soup... I had carefully shopped, spending over 90 minutes in the Pacific Ocean Marketplace, FINALLY finding the Japanese aisle, FINALLY finding canned Nameko mushrooms, never finding Kombu, hopefully buying Kelp to substitute, never finding the alum soak, never finding the dandelions, nor the Japanese sweet potato but persevering and now we're making the soup only to find we don't have cornstarch. WHO doesn't have CORNSTARCH? Well, I guess we don't. Not tonight anyway. So all the time spent to prepare for this soup and we are stymied by cornstarch. And now that I look at the deceptively simple recipe that refers one back to 5 OTHER references/recipes. I give up.This book will now be relegated to the coffee table.Color me frustrated.Give me Bobby Flay."
5,"The final word in authentic, delicious & beautiful Japanese cuisine","Elizabeth Andoh is a remarkably gifted writer and her cross-cultural expertise is unmatched. The delicious recipes in Washoku are just one facet of this truly interesting book. Her suggestions and practical tips are really helpful, while the aesthetic and design are none short of inspirational. Amongst the most elegant cookbooks around, the text is brimming with information and the recipes are approachable for daily use. I highly recommend Washoku for all fine cooks and as well as for Japanphiles."
4,Good gift,I bought this as a gift for my sister. She is very interested in Japanese cooking and she really has enjoyed the recipes.
5,A must for any Broadway fan,"This is an excellent compilation of the best of geniuses like Boublil & Schonberg, and ALW. The music was breathtaking, but the performers were the best of all. Elaine Paige was fabulous. Michael Ball was excellent. Ruthie Henshall was wonderful oh God I wish they had shown more of her. Colm Wilkinson was brilliant. Bernadette Peters was actually incredibly annoying, I don't see anything in her. The same with Judi Dench (""Send In the Clowns *shudder*). The best performer of the night was Lea Salonga. Her voice is nothing short of phenomenal. Her Kim & Eponine are both spectacular."
5,Watch this with a box of Kleenex,"It's worth it just to have the production numbers from Les Miz on video to watch over and over. Listening to Fantine sing ""I Dreamed a Dream"" will make you want to rewrite Sondheim's lyric to ""Send in the Tears""."
3,Not as colorful as the BBC series,"This book is drier than the wonderful BBC series starring Ian Richardson. But because Michael Dobbs spent years as a journalist covering British politics, plot points that are simplified or glossed over in the series are explained in more detail. So I feel like I understand what went on in the TV series more, but it's not as much fun. The book went through some significant changes on the way to the teleplay adaptation."
3,Doesn't Hold Up Over Time,"It pains me to say this, but this music just doesnt hold up over time. I first heard this albumas a 13 or 14 year old skater punk. 15+ years later I decided to take a stroll down memory laneand got this CD. It just doesnt give me the same chills I remember it giving me as a young kid.In its defense, I guess it is difficult, if not impossible, to relive those teenage years. Alas,it is time to get back to reality."
1,Would not buy again,"It was a good and romantic idea to use this, but it smells like chemicals which ruined the mood. It doesn't smell like lavender at all! It's moisturizing and feels soft, but my husband didn't like the residue left on the hand. Maybe the other scents are better but I won't buy it again since you can't return it once you buy it."
1,"Smells like chemicals, leaves filmy residue on skin, seller would not accept a return",This product was a complete dissapointment. I don't know what is in it but it is not lavender. It smelled awful and chemically. It also left a filmy soap like residue on the skin. And I expressed my dissatisfaction to the seller and he would not accept a return.
5,Hetman Oil is the best for horns!,"Horn valves never worked better since using Hetman products. I use them and now my students all use them. The good thing about Hetman is that you don't need a lot of it to get good results and it doesn't break down as fast as other oils. I highly recommend you try Hetman Oil for your rotary valves. BTW, they are not paying me to say this. :)"
2,A Little Disappointed,I ordered thinking I was getting the larger print version of this Bible.The content is great stuff and I have other copies but I wanted these to share with others. Wish they would have been the larger books.
3,A Gift for a friend,The book was not in as good of condition as the one i ordered for myself but it was sufficient.
1,They butchered the real thing!!,"Having grown up on this show (i first watched it at 3 years old-i got it as a gift on my 4th birthday), i was horrified at these songs. Yes, i am only 14. and yes, i grew up on the MOVIE. But the movie is the real way this should be!! anyone who enjoys this has to go see the movie to see what its really about. The time warp on this cd fully petrified both my parents and most of my friends - it is horrible. The movie is the best ever, and it wont get any better than that. The only good tracks on this cd are tim curry's and meatloafs!!"
3,A GLAM ROCK EXTRAVAGANZA,"This is ""The Rocky Horror Show"" from its 1974 Los Angeles production starring Tim Curry. Staged at a Los Angeles night club, the Roxy, this version of the show was a huge hit and was supposed to promote the upcoming film. The recording (by Mamas & Papas producer Lou Adler) is a bit too glossy for some tastes, and some of the Californians brought in to replace the original cast don't seem quite at home in this oh-so-British venue. But on the whole, this record is still glamorously sleazy. Tim Curry's belted renditions of ""Sweet Transvestite"" and ""Charles Atlas Song"" equal or surpass the film versions, and Meat Loaf is on hand to play not only rocker Eddie but his stuffy uncle, Dr. Scott. This album has the distinction of being the most complete edition of the score, lacking only the ""Science Fiction"" reprise which is reprinted in the liner notes anyway. The interior photo montage is also quite a treat."
4,It was great when it all began...,"This version ia great! A little different from the Picture Show but they belt-out the tunes like they're on stage, just what I love! Tim Curry is still a god amongst mere mortals, let us all give thanks to Richard O'Brien. Amen.It was great when it all began, I was a regular Rocky Horror fan, it was over when he had the plan, to start a working on a new type of Transvestite clan (A picture show!), now the only thing that give me hope, Is shouting vulgarities at a screen & smokin' dope, Rose tints my world, keeps me safe from my trouble & pain..."
5,"It thrilled me, chilled me, and fulfilled me","This CD is one of the first cast recordings (the first being the original 1973 London cast). This recording is AMAZING. The musicians used know what they are doing. The cast has never sounded better. I have heard many cast cd's and this is the best. I prefer this one over the movie soundtrack. Tim Curry has never sounded better. It makes me (oooh) shake! Jamie Donnelly does a great Magenta. Meatloaf does a great Hot Patootie, but his version of ""Eddie's Teddy"" far surpasses that of the movie. It sounds completely amazing. If you love or even remotely like Rocky Horror YOU MUST HAVE THIS CD!"
5,Drop-in Replacement on my Volvo 164,"Excellent quality replacement for the master cylinder on my 1970 Volvo 164. No issues at all, fit as it should."
1,Not very good scholarship,"The subject of Biblical history is certainly a fascinating one and and I had eagerly awaited dipping into this volume. Unfortunately, though, I found myself too often distracted by glaring mistakes of fact (a couple gaffes which would have brought poor grades to a high school student) and some preposterous conclusions which were far from justified by the evidence. Aside from this I'm afraid I can say little else in review. There is a certain level of competence one should be able to expect from authors and publishers, and when the most basic level is not achieved I lose my patience. I do not recommend this to readers with critical faculties. But without them I suppose you might find this book quite enjoyable."
1,gimme a break,"If you want art buy an art book, if you want math history get Bell or Boyer (among others). But if you don't like to read and think math should be pretty pictures this book is for you.Many retail stores carry this book so get it in your hands to decide whether you want it."
5,"Mister Dog, The Dog Who Belonged to Himself. That's it!","One of the most whimsical, quirky, endlessly entertaining (for the parents as well as the kids) books I've found (this one at a yard sale). Politically incorrect, Mister Dog lives in a 2-story doghouse, eats strawberries, walks himself, and smokes a corncob pipe. He meets and adopts a little boy who also belongs to himself, and the two independent souls begin to live together cooperatively and happily. Indescribably charming. One of Ms.Brown's best, and should be revived for all of us jaded parents who have to read the same story over and over again. This one holds up and makes us smile every time."
5,"""Destined to be a Classic""","This song will touch more people than Elton John's ""England's Rose. What a phenomenal young lady Leanna must have been to have such a wonderful tribute written about her. The lyrics and composition reach out and grab your heartstrings. This song sends a message that we all need to live each day of our lives to the fullest as Leanna did. Erik Bennett is definitely a new star on the rise. Not only does his music establish him as a songwriter and musician, but his wish to have a portion of the CD proceeds go to scholarship funds set up in Leanna's name at Georgia Tech, Parkview Highschool, and Zeta Tau Alpha Sorority place him right up there with the ""Stars"" of the music industry. Thank you for sharing your talent and Leanna's Song with us"
5,Sure to be #1,"As Leanna's cousin this song has special meaning to those who knew and loved her. This song, however, has significance for anyone who lost someone too soon. Erik is a gifted and talented musician who is able to put in words and song what most people only feel in their heart."
5,"It was great, very heart felt emotions!!!!!!","It is great. You can tell that Mr. Bennett put his heart in to this while writing and then while singing this song. It makes you stop and think and appreciate the time you have because you never know when ""goodbye"" is coming."
5,I don't even like this kind of music,But for some reason it's GREAT! Everytime I listen to it I picture all the scenes from the movie. Which by the way is probably my number one all time favorite. I think this is the best movie soundtrack. Buy it Now if you're a fan of the movie.
4,it is a great rock and various other sounds album,I saw this movie on usa up allnight one night then i rented that next weekend. i thought it hade the cool comedy and gory effects that were awsome eventully i bought it and then i wanted the soundtrack so i came here to amzon to get it and it is awsome thanks amazon.
4,Kountry Boy Kari Keil,"I remeber first seeing this film when I was about six years old on video. I thought it was one of the best horror movies I had ever seen, and I had watched a lot of Horror movies. Over the years I must have rented it a hundred time before I had finally bought it. Then the music in the movie was finally drilled into my head. Then I had started watching the movie to listen to the music. I could not find this CD in stores at all, But I had finally found it in a punk music store that had it. Now all I ever do is blow all my money on punk music. I thank it all to this awesome f*cking soundtrack and movie."
1,Excellent Painters-Very little information,"I was thrilled to have the DVDs but disappointed in lack of narration about each painter. I had expected a detailed historical account of each painter's works and the context within which painter's works were set, historically, culturally, politically. Very scan information and lack of narration made this collection much less than desired."
4,Good bedtime book for us,"PK Hallinan has a series of {insert relative) and I books. They are all enjoyable to read, and help to settle down our little ones at night. The all have subtle variations between them as they tell a short story about the special things children sometimes do with grandfathers, grandmother, and of course parents.Highly regarded in our house, and very inexpensive."
2,oh my,"This one is good but the other disc is better. Get the Rauhofer mix. Get the Red Square Mix. Get the Kamono mix.Sure the names on the other disc are lesser known, but the mixes blow the doors off of these supposedly club powerhouse mixers."
3,effective but bulky,"These are not low-profile clips. They are quite bulky and wouldn't be great for fitting inside a box, for holding a cereal bag closed for example. But they are fine for chips or other bags that don't need to be contained."
5,Strong Clip,"These are the best clips available, in my experience. I've purchased many over the years, and most aren't very wide, and have lame spring-strength. These OXO grips have worked great, and are worth the money. These are wider than most 'chip clips', and can squeeze down any rolled up bag with ease. Should I ever need more, I'll buy only these bag clips."
5,Robust and useful for larger bags,"These are especially good for larger bags requiring sealing and match the set of smaller ones I purchased perfectly well. Living in three places, two where ants are a problem (New Zealand and Hawai'i) and one where weevils are (France), it is good to be able to seal things off for storage in the pantry or in the fridge-freezer."
5,Like them!,"For chip clips, these work great. Can't say alot about them. They are bigger which is good for big bags and keep them closed."
4,Good product - maybe overpriced,"Good Grips.. they work very well, but - they are expensive for the purpose designed."
5,Great clips,These are the best chip clips I've ever used. I was very tired of flimsy plastic ones that break and crack. these are sturdy and hold securely.
5,Great Deal,"These bag clips are really well worth buying! They are well made and strong. Not the cheap light plastic you usually see. Thick solid plastic not the hollow beam type very strong, similar to heavy cooking utensils. Very good grip, easy to hold and a strong steel spring. Big enough for a large bag. Definitely worth a look."
2,"Merely ok, and not nearly as good as the OXO Good Grips 1062152 Heavy Duty Clip","This bag clip is just OK if you only want to close a bag of chips. For some reason I cannot explain they discontinued their Oxo Heavy Duty Clip which was far, far superior in every way possible. Amazon used to carry it, and if I had known Oxo was going to stop making them, I would have bought several of them to have on hand. Their Heavy Duty Clip was the best I have ever found, it was extremely versatile, and it was good looking too.These bag clips cannot begin to compare or be as useful to the Heavy Duty. They are not as strong, and their shape is not as functional. They only work for closing a bag of chips, and that can be done by any number of other clips on the market. I bought these red clips hoping they might be useful, but I am extremely disappointed. Once again, as is so often happening nowadays, a company has discontinued a superior product and replaced it with a poor, inferior substitute."
1,Coaster,"This CD is so bad that turning it into a coaster was the best thing I could think of. I tried to sell it, but the most I could get was around 70 cents. I would ship you mine if you don't mind a heavily scratched CD. The recording quality is poor, and the songs are just garbage. I am much happier with the Beezlebubba release."
5,Love Dead Milkmen,"One of my favorites, it could be yours too... if you like music for kids on acid, by kids on acid. Quirky and fun, don't buy it if the 1980's punk wave wasn't your thing."
3,"Great photos, thin narrative.",I realize that the text was translated from Italian but it's kind of rough going. The author uses a lot of flowery expressions as he narrates Tazio's racing career. Sometimes the years aren't mentioned so one must assume that everything is chronological There's nothing about the man other than his racing exploits. What he did from 1939 to 1946 isn't even mentioned. The pictures are really great. He's such an interesting fellow that I would like to read more about the man.
4,My dad,The title songs brings back great memories of MY DAD who passed away already 40 years ago. I'm sorry he never heard it.
3,Is this his best?,"I rate this 3 stars for one reason only. His best song and only hit to my knowledge is ""Nothing but a dream"" Even John Denver's rendition as great as he did it pales in comparison to Jessie Winchester's version. Jessie wrote the song. To call a CD ""The Best OF"" and leave off his only hit is just shy of criminal. This is a great CD, but would have rated 7 stars if the included his best and most famious song"
2,Excellent and lousy at the same time,"The last movement begins magnificently, about as good an interpretation as there is. But then Lenny lets his wayward ego loose and ruins the rest of the movement completely with erratic tempi, fast and then slow and then fast again, so that the whole stately structure of the music is lost. Poor Lenny got it and then promptly lost it. Maybe he was too young. This is from 1960."
5,A Human Brahms,"This disc and its companions, which contain the other three Brahms symphonies plus the Tragic and Academic Festival Overtures and Second Serenade, are among my favorites for these works. In all the symphonies, Bernstein manages to convey grandeur while preserving a sense of lithe sense of the human, very much as he does in his NYPO recording of Schubert's Ninth. That wonderful balancing act perhaps doesn't work quite as well in the Brahms, but for me it works well enough. While a number of conductors and orchestras give us musical granite, Bernstein and his New York musicians give us flesh. My other favorite renditions of this and the other Brahms symphonies, besides the Bernstein/NYPO discs, are the set by Mackerras and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra on Telarc and Bruno Walter's venerable set with the Columbia Symphony on Sony. All three have their own viewpoint and their advantages, and I would be happy with any of them. Actually, to tell the truth, I AM happy with all of them."
5,An outstanding contribution to Vietnam War studies.,"In Your War, My War: A Marine In Vietnam, Sergeant Donald Myers shows us the chaos and hysteria that was the hallmark of active combat in the Vietnam War. His memoir begins on October 30, 1967 when he arrives at Gio Linh and spans sixteen months of lethal combat and mind-numbing drudgeries of military life in a combat zone. What makes Your War, My War unique and distinctive from other Vietnam biographies is that each chapter represents a day's journal entry, juxtaposed with American newspapers that coincide with the entries, enabling the reader to envision the contrast of the American political and journalistic structure versus a day at battle. This contrast of the reality of Vietnam with the Never-Never Land perceptions back home is particularly jarring and informative. Your War, My War is a highly recommended and much appreciated contribution to the growing body of literature on the American military experience in Vietnam."
5,Deep calls to deep,"Adoration has long been one of my favorite books to buy to give away. The author writes meditatively, almost in poems - and helps you see the dance of your heart and the Lord's in ways that have at times left me in tears. This is a great book for getting in touch with deep heart realities. If you buy it, get a few copies because you WILL be loaning this out or giving it to others once you read it yourself. It's not that long and you can read it in a few days."
2,"Feels Like Voyeurism, In A Bad Way","TVZ was a gifted and troubled soul; and you definitely hear both in this recording. Sadly, I found there was too much of the latter for me to enjoy this. When you hear this performance, it becomes obvious that this was a human being completely swamped by his pain. On this recording, it is obvious he had lost the battle to hold things together, and that robs him of his dignity. Ultimately, maybe one needs to hear this too to see where the stories he tells actually end in the real world. I am not sure. All I know is that this is too much for me."
4,Near the end...,"If you know Townes'work well, you should probably own this album; if not, try ""Live At The Old Quarter"" for glimpse of a true giant at the height of his powers...While in a state of serious deterioration at McCabe's, Townes still expressed, maybe exposed is better, in croaks & jokes the real heart of his all American low down blues."
4,beatles ed sullivan shows,"Its a good tape, easy to navigate, you can see only the Beatles shows if you like. It will bring you back to the Day, lots of fun to watch. The seller got it to me quickly--- no complaints. Its black and white, not the color version"
3,Poor image and sound,"I'm one of the biggest fan of Beatles of all the time...BUT!!!The image and sound are too poor, if you do not know what to do with your money, just buy it...in other hand, is nice to see the all show, with the old commercials from the time, and the performance of the fab 4 are great.....your choice.."
3,Same as SOFA productions,"Overall it is still a very good set. These are the original shows featuring the commercials as it was aired on those very special days. I agree though, there is nothing new about this 2 disc set. I also agree that production must have switched hands. Regardless it is still worth the money for this very cool piece of history. Imagine a night with the family, connect a DVD player to a old B&W TV, shake up a pan of Jiffy Pop and go back in history! Love it!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"If you own one of the earlier versions of the Beatles Sullivan shows don't bother buying this one. I bought the first release in 2003 and the picture quality is actually better than this version. As far as being newly remastered you can forget it, the definition seems worse than my 2003 copy."
5,Excellent nostalgia,"I am huge beatle fan in my late 40s, so I would be expected to love this. However, I watched it with my wife and both of our parents. From their standpoint, they enjoyed seeing some some of the other talents they knew. We all were fascinated with the commercials -- mainly Pillsbury products that make cooking easier. The traditional male-female roles of the time were evident.From my standpoint, I had only seen clips of the shows (mainly the first on in NY). I didn't realize they performed three weeks in a row. This DVD allows a better perspective of these historic performances. Someone just watching the first two shows at the time could easily think of Paul as the leader of the band. I noticed in the other shows, John's singing was highlighted more.Worth it for every Beatles fan, and fan of the British Invasion."
5,Beatles fan must have,If you remember that night they first were on Ed Sullivan this is a must for you. The entire show commericals and all. Felt like I did that first time I saw them. Then they have the second time they appeared also on the DVD. Gotta have.
5,Good Purchase,"I had wanted to purchase something for a friend who helped me during a difficult time and fortunately found the best price on Amazon. The item arrived about 5 days later and I was able to give to my friend, who was surprised and grateful, for the kind gesture."
3,"Great, but...","Very soft shoes, and the cushioning makes the impact really mild. However, these are not made for a narrow foot!When I run, my foot slips out a bit, and I cannot tighten them too much because then they become very tight around the knot area. As a result, I frequently have to readjust them during the running to find a least troubling position - quite annoying."
3,Medieval books and technology,"Although I was told I would receive my books between 28th October and 13th November, they arrived at my door on 14th October...Wonderful! Thank you Amazon.As you can see it's been about two weeks since I received my books, nevertheless I immediately started to read ""The History of the Kings of Britain"" to begin with, the cover is absolutely beautiful; the translation and introduction by Lewis Thorpe, poetic as well as accurate and I'm enjoying every single line of every page of this new old book..."
3,Enjoyable literature more than reliable history,"Geoffrey of Monmouth's chronicle of the Britons (mostly in England) reads a bit like Herodotus though on a lesser scale. As the author himself admits, his prose is brutally plain and of a ""homely style,"" and only a few vivid scenes come to mind when recalling two thousand years of British history (mostly consisting of public speeches, warriors' last stands and Merlin's prophecies). This might have been a great flaw for a work that is more literature than history, but the subject matter is intriguing enough for one interested in British civilizations to enjoy the book. Despite his appearance on the front cover illustration, King Arthur does not figure greatly in the History as one might have thought.This edition includes a chronology of historical events reffered to in the History with approximate years and a list of contemporary British rulers as recalled by Geoffrey."
2,Reprint of earlier book?,"This looks like a reprint of the original work by Bingham about his ""discovery"" of Machu Picchu. I read the original 40 years ago, and it sparked a lasting desire to go see this place for myself. I finally made it, and it is all I imagined it to be. If this is, indeed, a reprinting of Bingham's original expeditions, they are facinating period pieces full of the hardships of exploring before tourism, basic amenities, travel health care, much less maps. Machu Picchu was, of course, not lost to the Inca descendants, only to the White educated explorers from afar, so Bingham didn't really ""discover"" it, but he certainly publicized it and Yale helped!"
1,VERY BAD. CAN NOT BE READ,The book is missprinted all around and can not be readSent back and a new one was swnt to me
4,Very Good,Rock solid LP has different songs I like for different reasons. I'm afraid to catagorize them because you would be leaving some important element fo the band out.
4,Hot sounds from developing artists,"The lyrical quality of this album is outstanding, and I love the complex blend of tones. Jill's smokey, passionate vocals paired with the driving guitars and skins infuse this group with remarkable power. The lyrics are a bit simplistic at times, and the vocal range is somewhat limited; nevertheless, this band is worth paying attention to for their energetic musical presence. I hope to see some tour dates on the west coast soon!"
5,"Non-Heroic, Mature Beethoven","I have been enjoying Beethoven's cello sonatas by (now historical) DuPre-Barenboim live recording, modern piano prevailing over cello. In Bylsma-Immerseel set, the balance is ideal thanks to the early 19 century fortepiano played by Immerseel. The overall atmosphere is intimate and mature. And the difficult Op. 102-2 is played with confidence, without trace of technical difficulty. Recommended to people who does not regard Beethoven as a heroic composer, but a unexpectedly 'orthodox' composer. Recording is vivid. (Only reservation: what a cover picture! Sony should be more esthetic!)"
4,Good for the price,"I selected this bottle because it was one of the only and cheapest ones I could find that didn't have any sort of design or writing on the bottle. It works very well, and my pet loves it. The only problem is that the metal used to attach the bottle to the cage is a bit short, so changing the water is a bit of a hassle."
2,Perpetua: Early Church Martyr,"Didn't live up to the reviews I read, and It could have been a lot more interesting. I was disappointed"
1,awful,"I ordered this book on 1/10/09 and was given a date range of 16 days for delivery. I should have received the book by 2/3/09. Not only did I not receive the book, the sender did not inform me as to why the book was not available or if it was available. I would not purchase a used book through this vendor again."
4,"It's a good diet, but.....","This is an excellent diet for people who have plenty of time to prepare the menus and have the time during their day to get out and walk!! I am a busy executive who has only one time a day to get in a workout, and absolutely no extra time for the food preparation (especially the lunch menus) --the menus are a bit unusual, in that most are not available in restaurants, and therefore most times you are forced to bring your lunch (which again requires some preparation)!! Again, being in the business world doesn't allow for a lot of the necessary preparation. I have used his ""Hilton Head Diet"" a few years ago & it was very successful. Try it if you have the time!"
4,Follow exactly,I have done the original Hilton Head diet in the past and had very good results. As with most dieters; once I lose the weight I go back to my bad habits and struggle with the weight again later. Although I am not seriously overweight (20 pounds over) this diet will still worked for me.It is a good diet plan but you have to follow the meals exactly to get the ultimate result.I recommend this for anyone disciplined enough to follow the plan.
4,Owens has wrote a gripping narrative of the struggles of war,I knew that the war in the pacific was a hard fought battle but Green Hell: The Battle for Guadalcanal shows that it was even more than that. This book tells the story of man at war with man and man at war with nature. The island itself claimed more lifes than the bloody battles fought between the men involved it the struggle to control this tiny island. Mr. Owens starts his reader with the events leading up the need to occupy the island. Then he take you through the hell these men endured there and ends his narrative with the island frimly in the hands of the Americans. Mr. Owens shows us that the battle was more than just a battle for a small out of the way island but reveals its importance to the entire war effort. My hat's off to Mr. Owens for this well written book and my thanks for the men who fought there.
2,Bad History,"Green Hell is bad history. Owens is a journalist not an historian and it shows. The book draws primarily on secondary sources and is riddled with the same errors that have plagued earlier works. Moreover, there are no maps. Owens solicited inputs from veterans and these accounts, when they appear in the book, are simply wonderful. Indeed, they're the only thing which raises this book to the level of mediocrity. If you want an accurate and informative work on the Guadalcanal campaign, read Richard B. Frank's book."
5,Smells Great!,I bought this for my wife. She really likes it and I love the way it leaves her hair smelling. Sometimes I just burry my nose in her hair to get a good sniff - Yum!
3,Good if you ignore the one vital flaw.,"I tried to read this book a while ago having enjoyed the Lymond and House of Niccolo series', but I had a major problem - I didn't agree with Mrs. Dunnet's premise that Thorfinn and Macbeth were the same person. They did exist and were related, but it annoyed me so much, I couldn't finish the book. Other than this, it is a very well-written book, and immaculately researched (as all her books are), and gives a fascinating insight into Scotland in the Middle Ages - a much misunderstood and overlooked period of history. If nothing else, it is a refreshing look at an historical figure that has got a bad press courtesy of a certain W.Shakespeare Esq."
2,Disappointing,"I love historical fiction and so I was very excited to read King Hereafter. I am not terribly knowledgeable about MacBeth, either the historical or the Shakespeare version, but I trusted that Ms. Dunnett's fabulous writing would carry me along anyway. This book seems to differ from her other works in that the writing is less absorbing and her characters are poorly drawn and even confusing. Whereas I couldn't read her other books fast enough,I had to struggle to read King Hereafter all the way through. By the end of the book I did feel some empathy for the main characters but all in all King Hereafter does not measure up to Ms. Dunnett's previous efforts."
2,"Impressive, but boring...","Being an avid reader of historical fiction and attracted by the subject and praising (mainly) reviews of the book, unfortunately, after having started to read the book I couldn't make it further than the 20th page. Then it became clear to me that I simply can 't read it any more, because I already forgot what I had read 10 pages before. The background research performed by the author is impressive, and the book might have been a splendid read if only the characters were not drawn so one-dimensially. Has there been something else in their life than intrigues? Feasts, passion, life at home? They are mentioned only as background for innumerable meetings, strifles and scheming.Unfortunately it gives impression of an old chronicle, not of a book sparkling with true-to life characters."
1,Impossible to get into.,"I love historical fiction, usually the longer the better, but found this monumental novel impossible to get into. None of the characters captured my imagination, and eventually I gave up on this book out of sheer boredom. Let's just say Ms. Dunnett is no Sharon Kay Penman."
1,Awful scent.....beware!,I got this parfum after several orders of the Outdoor Fresh Shower CLEAN.......this parfum smells like Lysol or Mr. Clean....I promptly gave mine to anyone who would take it. I will stick to the outdoor Fresh Shower Clean....
4,Smells nice,"Smells nice and light, but doesn't seem to last a long time. Still for the office it works and doesn't overwhelm your co-workers."
2,Mr. Clean?,I got a sample of this...smells exactly like 409 cleaning solution. Gross! If I wanted to smell like this I'd clean the kitchen. Pass.
4,Fresh,It was not what I was expecting. I have a few other Clean scents that I love like the Clean Ultimate. This has a citrus note and is fresh smelling. It does smell somewhat like a house cleaner but not necessarily in a bad way. My husband thought it was also fresh smelling. I would not purchase it again though but will use it on days I want a pick me up because it does have that quality like when you smell a fresh orange or lemon.
1,TERRIBLE BATHROOM SCENT,"I WAS DISSAPPOINED WITH THIS PARFUME.IT REMINDED ME OF A RESTROOM,THAT WHAT MY HUBBY SAID TOO.WE DID NOT LIKE THIS SCENT AT ALL,I GOT TH ULTIMATE SCENT ALSO,IS ALL RIGHT BUT I LIKE PHILOSOPHY ALOT BETTER.MY SON MADE ME WASH ITOFF AS HIS EYES WERE TEARIG.NO GO FOR BOTH SCRENTS.DOES NOT SMELL CLEAN AT ALL."
1,Not what I expected and it didn't work anyway.,"I use a device like this to check for network presence. Replaced an old IOMEGA unit that I wore out. Turned this on, in the room with my router and it did not detect a signal. When I turned it on again, I got no lights. Like it needed a rest or something. Hooked up my old G router and the unit detected it. Would not locate my new N router signal. Since most new networks are now N technology, what use is this to me as either a service or traveling aid. Will likely return it. Did not note a B/G capability until I read the fine print on the package after I received it. A similar unit from Amazon selling for less than $10 worked fine. Returned this one, kept the other.Mobile Edge MEASL1 WiFi Signal Locator"
2,it works but only with obvious hotspots,The radius in which it picks up signals is not that great. You have to be pretty close to pick it up. Turn your laptop and usually you will see a wifi signal when you don't see it on here. Kinda defeats the purpose then.
2,Works alright,"If you just want to know If there is wireless in the direction you are pointing, this is an OK device. Although, even picking up some known locations that have wireless was a challenge. It's pretty useless in determining any kind of strength. The battery life is pretty good,though."

2,Better product available,"The problem with this device is it doesn't tell you if the network is encrypted. A better device is the Canary Wireless Digital Hotspotter, which displays the details of the detected networks. It is more expensive (around $50) but it is more useful."
3,Thank you for that information,"The previous review was very helpful. According to what was said in the previous review, you might pick up a signal and power up your computer, only to find that the signal is &#65279;encrypted because it is coming from a secure site.Does anyone know of a wi-fi locator that will provide information about whether you are picking up an ""open access"" or an ""encrypted and secure"" signal before you power up your computer and find that the signal is not usable?P.S. This item has been on backorder since the first week of December 04."
2,OK Product...for a while,"When I first received this locator it worked fine. You can use its directionality to find where the source is. However, after a few months the button required more pressure to work. Then it later required mashing it very hard and then it wouldn't always work. Eventually I opened it up to find the battery would not make contact unless it the entire circuit board was out of the case and the battery was slid partially out of the holder, but the case wouldn't allow it to stay in that position. ONE of two batteries, I think. It's been a while.Anyway, it works when it wants to."
2,"""Take Me And Raddish Me""","The British '04 film `The Truth About Love' stars America's sweetheart Jennifer Love Hewitt masquerading as a Brit in this somewhat jaded drama of love, betrayal and rediscovery is, shall I say it, a bust. To be fair, it isn't Jennifer fault, I thought she did quite well overall, she looks great as always and demonstrated the ability and range to do more than just light comedy. I hope she'll get the opportunity to act in more serious roles in a good production in the near future.I'm not exactly sure where to place the blame for this dismal failure, all I can say for sure is that nothing seems to work in this film. The usually likeable Jimi Mistry is totally out of character and a non-factor in the movie while Dougray Scott fairs a little better but not well enough to spark any real interest in the viewing audience. I guess you'll watch this one if you're a die-hard Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, there's no other reason to see it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am a huge Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, but this is not worth your money!!! Since I am a huge fan of hers, I wanted every movie she was in, but I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this one folks...it's just simply not good!!!"
2,worst movie of hers in awhile,this was the only movie of hers i hadnt seen yet; so i decided to buy it. i dont like the movie and think she has plenty of other movies that showcase her talent more. im a huge fan of JLove and i was disappointed in this film. i dont think its awful; it just isnt her best work.
3,Not one of Jennifer's better films,"Jennifer Love Hewitt looks good in this, as she always does. But, except for a couple of scenes, I felt the film was a bit weak, overall. There is some fairly good footage of Bristol, England. There is also the novelty of a man cheating on his wife with his wife, but not knowing that is who he is cheating with. Won't say how that comes about, it would ruin the film for you. Overall, though, I cannot give this a thumbs up for anyone except a big Jennifer Love Hewitt fan."
3,"Sweet love story, Crappy British Accent","I hadn't heard of this film, but I am a romantic comedy fiend, so I had to try it. There were funny parts, but it wasn't really a romantic comedy. The love and betrayal part was more on the serious side -- both the attachments and the betrayals are more real than they are comedic.I like Jennifer Love Hewitt, and I enjoyed the cast of this movie generally. The plot was not incredibly original, but it was cute. And the comedy part was not overdone -- some parts are genuinely funny, rather than bordering on the completely absurd. The only drawback -- JLH does not do a very good accent. I think she might as well have played an American expatriate married to an Englishman. But she plays cute, wronged, and vulnerable well, so otherwise, the character fits her. Don't watch if you expect seriousness or substance, but it you want cute love story, this may do the trick."
1,this movie sucked,"the only reason i got it was cuz of jennifer love hewitt, the storyline is horrible and i regret buying it! so don't bother! if ya wanna watch a cool love hewitt movie get heartbreakers instead!"
3,"well-paced, but still a fight club clone","this guy can write, good job capturing angst of middle twenties with no where to go, but the major premise of the second half of the book is a conceit borrowed from ""Fight Club"" - a guy gets a following of ordinary, everyday people who wreak havoc and commit (relatively minor) acts of terrorism in his name. The only difference being that the protagonist of Fake Liar Cheat doesn't try to amass a following, the way the protagonist of ""Fight Club"" does.Clearly Tod Goldberg is talented, I sort of wish he'd done something more original-it seems like he has something to say."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"the author seems to have so little regard for making sense that early on i was anticipating a reveal that what was being narrated was some kind of schizophrenic delusion or fever dream. the part when the boss says give me some names for a job, and he has to say names so he says Claire, and then that means she has to go work the temp job she never applied for, and she does it like she understands why. none of the 3 people in that scenario make any sense. and the other boss who jumps out a window? and the vaguely implied but never actually stated outcome of the $700something restaurant bill. the only reason i kept reading was that so many things were left unclarified to the point of being incomprehensible that i assumed there would be some interesting attempt made at resolving them, but there never is, it's just amazingly inept writing."
2,Ehhh -- another MTV entry,"I don't know, maybe it's me but I just can't seem to get overly excited about these MTV books. They all seem basically they same to me, all pandering to the MTV generation of Britney Spears non-readers. They must be doing a good job though because we keep buying their books.Fake Liar Cheat was okay. Nothing more than that. It reminded me of other MTV books that I've read in the past in that a lot of its plot lines and characters were unrealistic and underdeveloped. This book does its job of helping to pass the time, but anything beyond that is a stretch. If you're looking for good indie reading that is as believable as it is powerful, then I always recommend reading Dylan Raskin. These MTV books are just for passing time while waiting for the doctor."
2,"Fake, Liar, Cheat, CopyCat","I have just finished this book and enjoyed the ride. Ufortunately, I feel like I have read this book before. The reason for this feeling is that I have read all of Chuck Palahniuk's books. Fake, liar, cheat, is a virtual carbon copy of Palahniuk's Fight Club. I give Fake, liar, cheat two stars because I think people should read more books that shake their worlds and fewer crime thrillers. Anyone who reads this or a book by Palahniuk will learn about a society that they can't or don't want to see, permenatly changing them forever."
1,"Bad, Silly, Boring","This book is as superficial as the people it's written about, and just comes off as a lame rehash of those wacky Angelenos. It's a poor atempt at Elmore Leonard, or John Ridley, both of whom have written much sharper, funnier characters - especially in Ridley's Everybody Smokes in Hell. This just comes across as slick, shallow writing aimmed squarely at being sold to the movies. There's a reason this one only came out in paperback."
1,shallow,I could see what this book was trying to do but you have to have some depth. It is a book for god's sake. If I wanted TV I'd get one.
4,Fake Liar Cheat,I was expecting this to be targeted towards a younger crowd but the story nonetheless was delightful. I couldn't put it down. But I'm glad i bought it used. Granted... I'm cheap. :)
2,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper","I bought this book because the first few pages (the ones you actually get to read while standing in the bookstore) are hilarious. Mr. Goldberg opens his story with an ""Office Space""-esque portrayal of the inner workings of a temp agency. Unfortunately, when it's time for the plot to thicken, this novel unravels. The characters are weak, and the action is very unbelievable. By the end, I just didn't care what happened. The relationship between the lead character and his love interest is very forced and unnatural. Overall, this is a mediocre read. I occasionally go back and reread those first few hilarious pages, but there is no way I would consider reading the rest."
4,Good read,"Claire & Lonnie are exactly what the title implies... fakes, liars & cheats. While working at a dead-end temp. agency job, Lonnie meets Claire. She introduces him into a world (Hollwood) that takes him on quite a wild ride. Intriguing, funny and easy to read. You'll enjoy this one.Another good book about a dead-end job and Hollywood is ""No One's Even Bleeding""."
5,Plasma Goodness,"I'm currently a student working in plasma research facility. I had a problem in the fact that I could not take the plasma physics course that is offered here for scheduling reasons. I therefor needed a book that has all the basics of plasma physics, yet is simple enough that i could teach myself this field of physics. This books is exactly that. For any student with a good background in electricity and magnetism, this book will pick up right from the maxwell equations and derives all the needed equations quite explicitly making the reading much easier to follow. Also, the good thing about this book is the sheer amount of material it covers on the topic. It contains all the basics an undergrade needs to know and even for graduate students, it is a great read. It is well written and never boring. For it's explicitness and it's broadness of topics, I absolutely recomend this book."
5,Great Book,"I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering, focussing on plasma physics. I have access to a lot of text books, and normally you find that one book is good for topic A, but not so good for topic B. However, in this book I could find all the topics that were of interest to me (in particular the Boltzmann equation and its moments), well-written and easy to understand.Calculations are easy to follow and normally are explained by physical explanations using text and figures. The notation is reader-friendly, tensor analysis is avoided by using indices instead.The book is a text book, so one should not expect the latest and most detailed science results, or derivations ""from scratch"" (like the BBGKY hierarchy). Instead, the reader should expect a solid and detailed introductory text into plasma physics that covers a large amount of topics.To conclude, I can only recommend this book to every grad or undergrad student looking for a book to start with, or to brush up on some basics."
1,"Too much math, not enough applications for me",This text was not what I was expecting. My interest is in semiconductors and I was looking for an introductory textbook on the physics underlying different types of plasma processing which could serve as an updated version of Glow Discharge Processes by Chapman.This text has very little to do with applications and consists largely of page after page of calculus. My interest is in semiconductor processing which is not mentioned in the section on applications: Chapter 1 section 4.Do not buy this unless your understanding of advanced calculus is very solid.
3,incredible,"This is an old work, so it is ""out of date."" But it is so jammed full of careful analysis and brilliant insights that it is worth this outrageous price. The translator has published his own excellent work. It is mainly about the Old Testament and Mishnah/Targum but covers other writings from the ancient world including the New Testament."
5,Very Impressed!,I wasn't sure as I haven't heard of Pyle and there were no reviews. It is more than I thought it would be. It is completely adjustable and has very clear amplification. I wouldn't hesitate in buying another one. My only regret is not going with the speakers. At this price it is a steal. Very impressed!
4,Fox Tactical Hydro Sys.,"I must have been one of the lucky ones... My bladder has no leaks, while I do have to say that the taste of rubber is present. I ""borrowed"" some plastic hooks from another bladder system which fit very well for this hydration pack. the black cloth around the hose looks good and helps against freezing in the cold. Paintball goo cleans off very well. I purchased a good military grade hydration bag from SDS that is MOLLE fitted and have had zero problems. It holds alot of liquid and the nipple does not leak while i am moving around. Five stars if there was not a rubbery taste."
3,Does NOT work well with the Allen Company Summit Ultra-Lite Hydration Pack!,"This does not work well with the Allen Company Summit Ultra-Lite Hydration Pack! You will need to modify the pack in order to make it work properly.I also don't like the filler cap. I would prefer some sort of smaller top fill.Another nice feature would be something to place inside to spread the pack wide open while drying. I found myself stuffing objects inside the pack to ensure that all the cracks dried properly. For this, the huge filler cap WAS handy."
1,Missing--The Best of Thee Midniters,"My husband and I have searched high and low for this album hoping to find it in CD form. All we could find was this cassett, and although it was not available in CD we were very excited to finally get this album. We had purchased this album originally when around 1978 and LOVVVVVVVVED it!Imagine how very disappointed we were when we inserted the cassett in our cassett player and instead of Thee Midniters the recording was an unknown instrumental Jazz recording. Although the Jazz recording is very nice (my husband is choosing to keep this cassett, IT IS NOT THEE MIDNITERS. Greatly disappointed."
4,good and fast read,"I really enjoyed this book, especially having read ""Mr. Nice"" a few years back. The female perspective does give the whole story another twist. If you enjoyed ""Mr. Nice"" you shouldn't miss out on this one!"
2,Lack of Detail,"Don't get me wrong... I learned from this book a few but not quite what I'm looking for. It lacks which softwares is good to use... how it is done.... the how-to's are kinda missing. But it will be worth buying for a person that not into gaming industry yet. I mean, its like preview and lots and lots and lots of interviews..... not how to the games... ugh! Sorry to dissappoint you guys.... no offense"
2,An anectdotal primer,"With the various ways the title can be interpreted it is easyto see why a reader gets miffed if they aren't able to browse it. Codechanges frequently in the industry and many designers wouldn't want to give up their code for a general interest/hobbyist book. . . if there was such a thing it would have to be Game Developer magazine which is more for the experienced programmer than a beginner. This book falls short of its promise though well written. I will file it with my ""coffee table section"" good for toilet reading , no code, no introduction to games programming basics. It would merely be a supplement to a suite of tools- I believe Electronics Boutique sells it in their Games Programmer box- and that's about all it should be. Not a great introduction to actual game design bordering on a deceptive titling scheme"
4,Secrets Interesting though not all are helpful,"Make no mistake this is a genuinely interesting book. There are some great insights into the makings of some of the great games and some solid information is doled out to the reader as to the game-making process from start to finish. Its just that so much of what they say is stuff youd say to yourself ""yeah thats just common sense"".Still I dont regret a cent i spent on this book......its just that good to read but if you want in depth design tips look elsewhere."
5,AN AWESOME BOOK!,"While I was reading this book I found out many things that I did not know. This book kept me reading and reading. A real ""page-turner"". Although, some of the things in the book are imposiible to do. For example, if a kid wants to make a game you need a cast of voices, programmers, animators, etc. etc. etc. Basically, you need a lot of money and a lot of time. If you want to make a game and don't have the ""lot of money part"" chances are you're not making one. I'm rating this book regardless of actually making a game or not. The book was well written and deserves 5 stars."
5,Thrilling Mystery,"A friend sent me this book, and I read it in one shot-two hours. The story grabs you with three quick murders and then just flows. Characters are well done, but the author was too sketchy in developing the romance between the main cop and the assistant medical examiner. However, by involving a bunch of self-centered teenagers (is there any other kind?) Wagner delivers a story entertainingly different from your usual detective story. I've sent it on to another friend with a ""good read"" recommendation."
5,Willard Price Adventure Series,"I grew up with these books and am delighted to find my 10 and 8 year old enjoying them just as much....they are indeed a little dated now but the guy's skill in producing ripping yarns, one after another, still to me is unbeatable. With regard to ""political correctness"" it's portrayed 2 ways - the bad guy showing predjudice (and we are left in no doubt about who the bad guys are and how wrong they are for it). The other way is milder, in that maybe the odd remark does not gel - perhaps purely because it's written 40+ years ago or maybe some occasional remarks seem condescending, but I have found them a good sounding point to initiate discussion with my children. It's a win-win. (Quite apart from the fact that my 8 year old scientist/engineer does not see any value in reading stories at all, these were the only ones to have grabbed and kept his attention)"
1,It's the mono version,"Great album, but it's really too bad that this Japanese company didn't have access to the stereo master. Oh, well... as a stereo LP would be prohibitively expensive, I guess this CD is better than nothing."
5,An especially good dictionary of 'political conceptions',"This dictionary is especially good. This is because it was written entirely by Roger Scruton, one of the most distinguished political philosophers of modern times.He says the aim of the dictionary has been "" to extract, both from active debate, and from the theories and intuitions which surround it, the principal ideas through which modern political beliefs find expression. The emphasis of the dictionary is conceptual rather than factual, exploring the formuation of docrtines rather than specific application. Political events are mentioned only when they cast light on intellectual conceptions."""
5,A piece of art,"Listening to this record is an unforgetable experience to anybody who likes García Lorca's poetry. For the first time, the music matches his great artistic heights, thanks to the music of many of Spain's foremost popular musicians: Serrat, Victor Manuel and Kiko Veneno are just a few of them. The work of Michel Camilo as arranger deserves the highest and wildest praise, what a master he is, and what a job he's done here!!This is a masterful record, certainly one of the best in popular music in many years. Highly and warmly recomended."
5,Fantastic Album!,"Just get this! Very good album overall, my favourite song being Diotima.If you like this you should like: Lacrimosa, Katatonia, Anathema, Stratovarius, Adagio, etc"
1,Not what I was looking for ...,"Based on some of the other reviews here, I purchased this book with the objective to get a jump start on how to architect a .Net solution. For example, I was looking for answers to questions like: How to integrate with legacy applications, how to modularize, where to put components, security and performance considerations, redundancy and sizing, database connectivity, etc etc.There is nothing in this book pertinent to .Net architectures, in my opinion. It is a collection of common practices and questions to ask that every architect should be familiar with, anyways. I am a Sun Certified J2EE Architect, and much of what I saw in this book could be legitimate questions at the Sun test as well - that's how generic this book is.I am not interested in passing the exam. Don't buy this book if you are not, either."
5,The Raindrops CD,"This obscure group includes two Rock and Rock songwriter hall of famers, Jeff Barry and Ellen Greenwich. The only reason I purchased this was to verify that song #26 (no credits given) on another CD, 'The Girl Group Sound' (Red Bird Records) was the same song as The Raindrops 'Another Boy Like Mine'. This was the case, but after listening to other Raindrop songs I was pleasantly surprised with some of the other songs. I like two songs that I believe were written and recorded by the RainDrops before other groups made them famous: 'Hanky Panky' and 'Da Doo Ron Ron'. Other songs on the CD that I had never heard before but like is 'What A Guy', 'Isn't That Love', 'Not Too Young to Get Married', and 'Let's Go Together'. And lastly I like their version of 'Book of Love' and 'Don't Let Go', written by others. Sometimes Jeff Barry's occasional deep vocals get in the way, but he wrote it so he can sing on it."
5,A not-so-kosher romantic comedy,"If you have strong religious views better skip this one. If not, this is a hilarious little British gem done in the best Richard Lester tradition, with lots of talent and practically no money at all.. Wonderful performances all around (notably the late Mark Frankel) but Maryam D'Abo steals the show as the ultimate goy sex kitten from hell! Great fun!"
1,Oh the poor trees!,A rambling pastiche with little value to the serious writer. The thought of trees being sacrificed to make the paper in this book is saddening.
4,Picture Qua;ity,"I read the other review which said that the picture was grainy. More so than a Sony camera of comparable qualty. I took pictures in good light and found that the video quality was excellent in normal and telephoto shooting. I used Hi8 video tape. The picture was grainy only in low light situations. In a low light situation I don't plan to take videos, although the lens is light sensitive enough to take such pictures. I have several other camcorders of different models and types and this camera stands up with the best of them. It is also small and very easy to carry and take pictures... I plan to keep it. It is an excellent camcorder."
4,My husband likes this camera,"I bought this camera as a gift for my husband. He previously asked for a model that had tons of features, however after receiving and using this one, he felt he had all the features he really wanted/needed. It's a decent, basic camera for home movies."
5,professional,I ordered this camera and received it in 2 days after ordering. Warped Speed is very professinal and go out there way to ensure that their customer's get the greatest customer service satisfaction.Thank You Warped Speed looking forward to buying from you in the future.Anna Thomas
5,WOW! I LOVE IT!,"THIS IS THE BEST CAMCORDER EVER. DONT GO SPEND 1500 BUCKS ON A DIGITAL CAMCORDER,THIS IS BETTER AND NOT TOO BIG W/ IMAGE STABILIZATION.HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!"
3,There is no wireless controller!,I just wanted to tell you that I didn't recieve any Wireless controller.
1,"Good at the start, then after some use it failed",I found mechanical problems in this camcorder.the trunk didnt close.Do not make a mistake. pay a little bit moreand get a Sony. I am really frustated with thiscamera.
4,Inspired playing by Henderson,"First of all, Kenny Dorham sounds great on this CD. He creates interesting lines of notes melodically, and makes great ""special effects"" sounds with the trumpet. But my favorite part of the album is the Joe Henderson solos. He is clearly inspired by Tony Williams and Herbie Hancock. Tony's inventive drumming and Herbie's stacatto comping give him interesting material to play around. Joe here is both rhythmically and melodically interesting. He swings, but doesn't play each note at the exact beat where a swinging rhythm would be expected. His playing is somewhat similar to Wayne Shorter's, but Joe certainly swings his eighth notes more than Wayne."
3,Not as good as expected,"To me, this CD was disappointing. I have lots of albums of Kenny Dorham and while his playing is fine (he never played bad, did he?) and he is one of the most underrated trumpet players in jazz history, I like most of his other albums much more...Whistle Stop, Quiet Kenny, Our Thing (side man to Henderson), Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers, to name a few...The audio quality of this CD is not very good. Bad balance. There is so much more and better work of Mr. Dorham."
3,Functionary,Latin flavored bop is accommodating though rarely inspiring like so many of these more traditional early jazz offerings tend to be.
3,Once Might Be Enough,"The five-star reviews here and elsewhere (notably Blue Note's in-house critics) frankly surprise me. The Latin groove predominating on these tracks does not seem conducive to these musicians communicating emotion, so everything has a slightly technical and distanced feel. If you have a large collection then I'd still recommend sampling this, but if you're looking for a first taste of any of the featured artists then perhaps you should think twice - each and every one of them have more involving albums."
3,A bit disappointing,"I recently purchased ""Page One"", which was the second collaboration between Joe Henderson and Kenny Dorham. I love it. So I rushed to purchase ""Una Mas"" (their first collaboration) thinking that I would hear the same incredible bossa nova sounds. However, I was disappointed. The same richness and consistency from ""Page One"" were missing. It's certainly not a bad effort, but not nearly as nice as ""Page One."""
4,John Lennon Lives,"Kevin Spacey was a fabulous, wonderful host for this program. His energy was at the top and his heart was worn on his sleeve the whole time he spoke.I think the best performance was by Dave Mathews doing In My Life.All in all I enjoyed the music, lyrics of John Lennon's songs, as always. I liked some of the performances very much and others, not at all.But the DVD is worth owning for the heart and healing that comes through. I also wished Julian would have been there. That felt a bit hypocritical. We can heal the world but we can't heal our own personal wounds and come together on a more personal and indivual level."
4,Lou Reed Alone Makes it Worthwhile,"This shoulda been a concert video. If you purchase it, just by-pass the commentaries and cruise to the covers of John Lennon's songs. Oh man, Lou Reed's rendering of ""Jealous Guy"" alone makes this DVD a great purchase."
5,COME TOGETHER is a great tribute to Lennon & NYC,"Tremendous and poignant night of music honoring John Lennon and, although not initially planned, New York City. This was one of the first major public events in NYC post 9/11 and in many ways it was fitting that a night of Lennon's words and music began the long healing process. John Lennon could have lived anywhere in the world and he chose NYC. What would he have done and/or said in NYC's darkest hour had he been alive? We can only imagine but there is no doubt, Lennon would have been in the forefront of the healing process, just as McCartney was with the Concert for NYC. Dave Matthews performs a griping acoustic version of IN MY LIFE and this is a great tribute with many cool versions of Beatle & solo Lennon material."
5,Excellent! Great songs! Great performers!,The concert is excellent. The songs chosen represent John Lennon at his best. The performers make outstanding performances of them. What could be asked of a tribute?
1,Not worth even 1 star,"I've been a Beatle fan since my high school days in the early 60's. John and George were always my favorites. I've heard some good artists do good renditions of some of their songs, but what I never heard were so many Lennon songs done so poorly by so many muscian/singers at one sitting. Who chose these people? And who picked the house band? Frankly, I found most of the performances an insulting tribute to John's music. Many songs I wouldn't have recognized if it weren't for the words, which I know so well. The concert was a huge disappointment to me and I'm glad I rented it so I can take it back because it isn't something I'd ever watch again. The only redeeming quality to the concert were some of the video clips and words of John I hadn't heard before. I've got a huge Beatle collection, but this is one item I don't need."
3,"OK, but...","I like this little wallet on a string, however, I'm very disappointed in the string, which is too short to be worn across the body. I walk with forearm crutches, and the string falls off my shoulder, making it inconvenient. Otherwise, fine, but could use a larger cellphone pocket which could fit a smart phone."
4,A Great Read - a History Lesson,"This is a gem of a book about the Rev Henry Beecher. I suggest readers watch the revealing documentary, AMERICA'S VICTORIA, REMEMBERING VICTORIA WOODHULL and how Woodhull nearly brought Beecher down. This documentary is engaging with interview from Fox, Gloria Steinem and historians.America's Victoria, Remembering Victoria Woodhull (Director's Cut~ Two Disc - Collector's Edition)"
2,Not Quite as Exciting as Working a Crossword Puzzle,"I'm puzzled that the author has enough following to continue this series. Maybe it's better to start with the first one, A Clue for the Puzzle Lady.The main character, Cora Felton, and her niece failed to come alive for me. Cora seemed self-centered and fairly obnoxious while the niece (apparently the real puzzle lady) was pretty bland.This episode involves several murders in their Connecticut town while a charity crossword tournament goes on. Some of the oddball character descriptions intrigue the reader and several crossword puzzles allow the reader to join in trying to solve the murder. (puzzle solutions are included in the book)Overall, the mystery just lacked zip"
3,Audio Issues,"The product was shipped quickly, as advertised, and arrived in excellent condition, so there was no problem at all with the purchase itself. I was looking forward, however, to a high quality blu-ray remastering of a great movie, but became highly dissapointed in the performance of the audio. The video is acceptable, but not as spectacular as I had come to expect from the remastering of such classics as Scarface. The audio, though, when rendered through a 5.1 surround system, was poor to the point of being an annoying distraction. It would appear that whoever transferred this to blu-ray was just going through the motions. The two stars off were soley for the port to blu-ray. I still had to give this classic at least three stars and highly reccommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet."
2,"Get ""Really Smokin'"" Instead.","The audio of this CD sounds like it has been put through a filter. The bass frequencies are attenuated, distorting the overall frequency balance.Get ""Really Smokin'"" instead, which has the same songs, but sounds much better."
5,This CD tugged at my heartstrings!,"Tom Toth has really reached the depths of my heart and my life experiences with his work. He captures the true essence of what it means to have lived a life of love, joy and heartache. What a singer/songwriter!!"
5,Just like Starbuck's...a great blend....,"I think that Tom Toth has really turned out a CD for the new millenium. A wonderful mix of pop and folk, with a few other subtleties for good measure. Tom has put a lot of feeling and sense of passion into his work, and it shows on this CD. He sings of things we have all felt at one time or another in our lives, and expresses them in such a way that it touches us all. I urge you to pick up this CD and enjoy a refreshing new artist."
1,DVD versus instant streaming,"I wanted a DVD and this whole ""instant"" stuff will not let me get my product. I am very technically challenged because I am impatient, but I tend to figure things out fairly quickly. This whole experience just made me REALLY irritated. I guess I am headed to the mall for my husbands birthday gifts."
5,Love This Mat,"Great little mat, I ordered a second one from Amazon because I am using them for back seat floor mats. They fit the floor in the back seat perfect. When someone gets in my car I scream ""Don't step on Elvis's face!""."
5,vitamin b3 and schizophrenia,"this book is a must for every psychiatrist, and anyone who is familiar with someone who is sick with that disease, and try to find a real natural way of treating schizophrenia from the world's best orthomolecularist who treated thousands of patients of that disease with the principles that described very simple in that book.my own expirience with my schizophrenic patients showed good resoults."
5,Great bargain!,"We were wanting a simple, yet durable, harness for our cat. This totally fits the bill. It is very easy to put on, seems comfortable for our cat, and it's very strong. It restrains our rather large (15 pound) cat very well. And, the price was certainly great. Would definitely purchase another one of these."
1,A point? Not my style I guess.,I really had a hard time understanding the point of this piece. Perhaps it is just not my type of work.
2,Does not fit 4G 80G iPod classic,Product quality is fine - but it DOES NOT fit the iPod classic - way to big.
2,"Actually, better dead","Better Live Than Dead is an excellent example of what a live album should NOT sound like. It may have been recorded in the late 70's, but even by late 70's standards, the audio quality is poor. In fact I have heard better quality Sex Pistols material from sidewalk vendors. The concert itself is really lacking in the legendary energy the Sex Pistols have been known for. There is no witty banter with the crowd at all. Not a hint of antagonism from Mr. Rotten and not a single ""loogie"" is heard coming from the equally dead crowd. Simply a big let down if you're a Sex Pistols fan looking for a good live material."
3,Sex Pistols - 'Better Live Than Dead' (Restless Records) 3 1/2 stars,"Sound quality is okay... decent. Good to hear the Sex Pistols blasting out such gems like ""Anarchy In The UK"", ""I Wanna Be Me"", ""No Feelings"", ""Pretty Vacant"" and what not. But, this title looks to be the same show that was released under the CD I remember purchasing awhile back '76 Club'. I'm surprised no fans have yet complained about that on this open forum. One specific song here - ""Submission"" for some odd reason I simply don't recognize."
5,Fabulous !,"I heard this band's Karma release and went to buy it. I got this one on a whim , , , I LOVE it. It is up there with Enigma and others. . .this will grace my CD player for a long time to come"
5,Second best of Delerium is still in top 10% of all music.,Outstanding Music to Listen too. A Combination of Electronica/Techno/Gothic/New Age/Jazz. The album sets a excellent mood for fantasy get-togethers. Although I rate Delerium's Karma Album as my all time favorite; The song Incantation on Semantic Spaces is my favorite song of Delerium's. I can put any Delerium CD in my player and listen to them all day. Semantic Spaces is in my top 20 CDs I have played over the past year (1998). I currently have over 900 CDs so my opinion should count for more. I highly recommend this CD.
4,Excellent sounds,This CD offered the perfect background sounds for getting me through my big deadline... Excellent mix of rhythm and tone.
5,Want something new that you'll actually like?,"I totally reccommend this album. I can't explain anything different from what other people have said, but I know music, and this is very different. Kinda dancy, with captivating chant, and the bass seems to really be loud. But I really do think that this is a great cd. Try it."
4,Enigma + Deep Forest + Own Imagination = Delerium,"I like this Delerium CD, but not as much as Enigma, Deep Forest or Amethystium. I think Delerium has parts of it's CD ""copied"" from Enigma, Deep Forest etc. It is not as exciting as Amethystium, but it is still a cool music. I just ordered a usedDelerium : Morpheus from [a website]. I hope it will be as cool or coolerthan Semantic Spaces. Still, Delerium will be on my ""watch it""list along with Enigma etc."
3,I'll try to be more objective...,"and give this album its correct rating. It'd merit 3 and a half stars if the option was there but 4 is pushing it. The biggest weakness is its lack of originality. I don't mind emulating others if I enjoy that formula but it's easy to see what my heroes, the Front Line Assembly / Synaesthesia / etc. masterminds were up to here. Back in 1994 when this album came out, that ""tribal world"" sound was hip due in part to Deep Forest. Delerium clearly came into the studio attempting to combine the Gregorian chant/beat made so famous by Enigma in 1990 and the then ""in"" Deep Forest sound. They expected ""Semantic Spaces"" to be bigger than Enigma, but where's the uniqueness?At the same time, this Delerium release is better than most imitators and if this is your type of music you won't be dissapointed. There is plenty of that good old FLA synthesizer sound present and at 77 minutes-plus you won't feel cheated."
2,"It's ok, but it's not Enigma ... or FLA for that matter.","First of all, I like Enigma, and I also like Front Line Assembly (these guy's main project) but I wasn't blown away by this album for some reason. Any Leeb/Fulber expert, who isn't blinded by their love for these guys will admit that they are notorious, and often critized for excesive sampling of other people's work - and this album is no exception. It is LITTERED with Enigma samples (as well as a few other artists) ... and isn't near as satisfying of an album. I find it dull and boring and can't quite pinpoint why. Maybe because there are no surprises, it's too monotnous, or too contrived. Karma (Delerium's follow-up) is a much better album than this one, which I'd recommend instead."
2,Doesn't anyone notice the boring and trite percussion?,"All the nice things said in the other reviews are reasonably true, but sheesh! Electronica offers infinite options for percussion - it does not HAVE to be trite, incredibly monotonous, and synthetic sounding. This is the bane of so much electronica, it's a joke. Nothing with a petty-swingin' rhythm can be good. I would give this album four or five stars if I could just erase the silly percussion tracks - almost identical in half the songs. Get the Karma album instead."
4,Semantic Spaces an above-average CD,"This CD is pretty good. It is definitely above average. I was not disappointed. For $13.98 it is an excellent value. However, the $2.98 for shipping was a little too high and it destroyed the original value that came with paying $13.98 for a CD. I would have liked to pay $2.00 or less for shipping. Other than that, the music is above average. I would have given my purchase 5 stars instead of 4 if it had not been for the expensive shipping costs."
5,Neatto CD!,"This CD is just plain enchanting! I love the feel that I get everytime I liston to it. Kristy Thirsk has a brilliant, angelic voice that is both haunting and beautiful at the same time. Although she only sings on two of the tracks, Flowers Become Screens and Incantation, the rest of the CD is awesome. If you loved Kristy Thirsk on Karma (too bad she was not on Poem) then you have to get this CD. My all time favorite track has got to be Incantation (awesome!), but the whole CD is just a delight to liston to. If you like Enigma and the newer feel of Delerium then this is a CD that you have to have!"
5,Hypnotic!,"This CD will take you on a journey. You will travel to regions that dwell in your mind, in your fantasies and discover a whole new world. Apart from that; this CD will captivate you and you'll want to dance or sing or do both. Listen to it from beginning to end and see for yourself."
4,good but can be better,"Semantic Spaces is a good album and at best, really enjoyable.Some really enjoyable tracks in the album are ""Incantation"" and ""Flowers become screens"". I wish though Delerium could've put in more of a gothish and creepier sound to the album."
