1,You find better quality at the National Enquirer,"What a drag it was to read this shoddy & superficial book. I kept waiting for it to get better, but alas, I was cheated. Shame on me. At least I didn't spend any money on it as it was a public library book.For a deep & thoughtful analysis of George's music, read ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps:The Music Of George Harrison"" by Simon Leng. Mr. Leng is a scholar who appreciates good music and artists of integrity, unlike so many hacks posing as journalists & authors these days."
2,"If you're a Beatles or Harrison fan, save your money..","And if you aren't already a fan, I can't imagine you'd be interested in this quick gloss over of Harrison's life.Honestly, I was given this book as a present. And I read it over two days when I was home sick. The book is an easy read, and isn't poorly written. It doesn't sensationalize or gossip either. Thus the second star on the rating.But there was almost nothing in this book that I didn't already know. It was same as watching the show ""Biography"".If you need this book for your Harrison collection, then look for it in the bargain bin. Otherwise, I'd stay away."
1,Behind Bad Biography,"This hastily assembled George Harrison biography rehashes material from superior Beatle publications while offering little insight. Marc Shapiro's ""Behind Sad Eyes"" (2002) reads like an extended magazine article. No index, no proofreader, a limited bibliography, one genuine interview (milked for all its worth) and eight - count 'em, eight! - pages of Harrison photos. The author's most tasteless comment: ""No Beatle was harmed or interviewed in the writing of this book."" Pure hackery."
2,"George, (...)","George has always been my favorite Beatle. I have been celebrating his birthday and got the Concert for george Harrison and watched it on his deathdate, and even wrote my 6th grade biography on him. So, I turned to this book. There were plenty of grammatical errors and false information. I think that it said in the front that he didn't ""hassle any of the beatles for this information"" then how could he even get information such as this. Go to I, Me, Mine it's a better book because its WRITTEN BY HARRISON HIMSELF!"
1,Yeccccccccccccccccccccccccchhhhhhhh........,"I wrote a review of this book a few weeks ago and it was never posted. I guess I was so harsh the censor trashed it. That in itself should indicate clearly how little I think of this book.I'd give ""Behind Sad Eyes"" a negative 4 rating if it were allowed.Beyond the odd title--everyone I've mentioned it too assumed it was a book about Pete Townshend--the book is just slapped together. It is filled with factual inaccuracies, it is poorly written and, frankly, it is boring.'Nuff said."
1,Terribly written,"Where do I start... This book may be entertaining to someone with no more than a 2nd grade grasp of grammar and spelling or someone who knows nothing of the beatles and thier respective careers, but for people who dont fall into those categories, this biography is ridiculous! spelling errors aside, that is the copywriter's responsibility, but grammatical errors? come on man!!1. His use of the word literal bugged the hell out of me, apperently George had a meeting with ""a literal army of lawyers"" hmmmm and he ""literaly got his arm caught in a cookie jar"" right.2. Mr. Shapiro used the name ""Primal Scream"" for Lennon's debut ""Plastic Ono Band"" on more than 1 occasion.....c'mon man.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FOR THE LOVE OF GOD"
2,Does this guy have an editor?,"This book has lots of grammar and spelling errors. I repeatedly wondered if the author had an editor to check the errors. And some facts are wrong. For example, I think he says ""Rubber Soul"" was released in 1966, or ""Norwegian Wood"" was on ""Revolver,"" or something like that. The only good parts are the chapters on his solo career. And the discography."
4,A damaged family,"The mother of three adult disturbed siblings dies. She has profitably invested the money she got from Holocaust compensation, and leaves this to one of her sons in her Will. The damaged family relationships are brilliantly described; descriptive passages are often strikingly original and successful (the setting is New York and Michigan); and if in places it is a little repetitive, that could be excused on the grounds that the principal characters themselves are obsessional."
3,The German Money,"Although I liked this book, I found it to be just a little too wordy. The ending was really a surprise.Since I'm from Michigan, I found the author's use of Michigan areas to be nostalgic for me.This would be a good book for book clubs who are into holocost themes to be interesting for discussion"
2,Fails to tackle the issues.,"We read this in our shul book club, and our opinion was unanimous: it is a thin mystery, poorly written. Raphael opens up several Big Issues in this book and fails to close even one of them. The characters are dysfunctional, and we know why, but he doesn't offer us any insight into the nuances of this dysfunction.This book needed to be longer and better written to justify the serious issues it hangs its plot on."
2,Don't buy it!,"I bought this book because it was the only new SAT prep book available at the local bookstore and there were so many practice tests. I just took practice test 3 and THERE WERE SO MANY ERRORS..in the answer key, in the questions.. It isn't a surprise that ARCO's books aren't big hits like Princeton Review, Kaplan, Barron's, and Cliff's."
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought this book for the practice exams for practice before I take the SAT in May. Before this, I have used the official College Board blue book, as well as the Barron's book, and this book falls short compared to those two. The math was atypical of the level of difficulty seen in the other two books (as well as that of the real test, if the reports from friends can be believed), and the writing section had a considerable amount of error that can only be attributed to the ignorance of the book's testwriter. In my opinion, this book is a thoroughly unreliable test resource (I have not chanced a peek at the instructory segment, however). Caveat emptor."
4,Look smaller than it may seem,Look much smaller than the picture showed. It looks good on skinny ladies. Might not be good looking on a more chubby one because the watch itself is slim.
3,It's alright,The shower head works just fine but i dont really move the dial back and forth that much. The cord is sort of messed up so it doesn't sit in the shower head right.It works just fine though so i can't knock it to much. You get what you paid for here.
5,Great Book,"This is a fun mystery that kept me guessing to the end as to ""who done it."" I like the author's style and her sleuth, Bridget. She's not sappy, but smart and compassionate. There are a lot of interesting characters in the story . . . and I hope things work out between Bridget and that police chief.I think Bridget needs a little romance in her life to help her concentrate on her sleuthing. Hope to hear more about her in future books"
5,Easy to Install,I used this for my '05 Camry. It is easy to install. Here is a good tutorial on how to do it: [...]Overall easy to install and works perfectly with my new head unit.
2,Fills in the hole but doesn't really fit,The product doesn't fit as it should. The plastic frame of the product is larger than the opening for the original Toyota stereo. I would try a different manufacturer next time.
3,So so finishing with this,"I installed a double din Clarion stereo into a 2002 Camry. This trim kit worked, but it was ""so so"" in it's quality of fit and finish. I had to cut small spacer tabs in my car's opening to get this bezel plate to fit close to properly. After I got it all in place, ther was a gap right below the bezel and it was very difficult to get it to snap into place. For a ""nice"" car, this is definately the cheapest looking thing in it. It does the job, but definately NOT a professional looking piece."
3,Fills in the gaps *ok,"I'm a little unhappy with this kit. Contrary to the picture, the large bezel is not connected to the cubby-hole so it's a tad loose in the dash. There's also a slight gap between the bottom of the cubby-hole and the large bezel.Installation was somewhat straightforward. The bottom piece is keyed so it makes it easier.FYI, the bezel that comes with your after-market receiver will not fit inside the kit. It's designed that way, but it took me a while to figure that out."
3,"Too fancy, not our favorite of the series",We were looking for more basic recipes. Shrimp never graces our table and we just had different needs than this book meets. But my low rating may be way off for your eating habits.We much prefer the otehr books in the series.Bette's Tapioca bread is a staple at our house.
5,Loved the Recipes!,Very simple and easy to follow recipes for the beginner to understand. Thanks for the great book!
5,More from the Gluten-free Gourmet: Delicious Dining Without Wheat,"We haven't had a ""wheat substitute"" aftertaste from Bette Hagman's recipes. Her books are the gold standard in living with wheat/gluten sensitivity, and she doesn't use just one substitute flour mix. Also she educates on Celiac disease and issues around wheat sensitivity that impresses my wife, who is an RN. My favorite RN states that Bette Hagman has done more for wheat sufferers than anyone else she knows of, medical or laymen."
1,A Rip Off,"I bought this book along with The Great Book of Optical Illusions by the same author. The ""Great Book"" was suggested by Amazon as pair for ""More,"" and indeed if you look on Amazon's page for ""More Optical Illusions"" you find that many people bought both books. However, ""More"" is just the last half of the ""Great Book"" so if you buy the ""Great Book"" you don't get any more with ""More."" This is especially galling in view of the text by author Al Seckel, who writes in BOTH books: ""Many books on optical illusions reprint the same examples over and over again, but this is not the case [in this book]."" Amazon's book pages and suggested pairings may be generated by a computer, but this is one case where Amazon should insert a human's touch to make sure its customers understand before purchasing ""More"" that it is simply a partial version of ""Great."""
5,Such an inspiration!,"This book just about saved my life. I was pretty upset about something, and feeling like I just wasn't going to achieve my lifelong goal, and then I read this book. Cover to cover, every word. I still refer to it almost daily.Byrd just reminds you on every page that YOU CAN DO IT, while providing helpful lessons along the way. I highly, highly recommend it!"
1,What Rudenstine left out,"Rudenstine, a lawyer leaves out any consideration of international law. For example, he fails to even mention Professor Richard Falk of Princeton University who edited three thick volumes on international law and the Viet Nam War. Falk is the lawyer who is the leading authority on the Pentagon Papers. Rudenstine also gives short shrift to the trial that was the main reason for Nixon's fall (much moreso than the Watergate burglary): the Ellsberg- Russo Pentagon Papers Trial which came about as a result of my civil disobedience (refusing to testify before the Pentagon Papers grand jury and thus going to jail) in the summer of 1971. As a result of these omissions Rudenstine's book is seriously flawed."
2,What About the Ellsberg-Russo Trial?,"What's the author's problem? Alxheimer's or ""selective memory?"" He fails to mention the ""joint trial of Dan Ellsberg AND Tony Russo"" -- and Russo went to jail for civil resistance over the Pentagon Papers! -- and the author fails to mention the participation of renowned international law scholar Richard Falk. Surely with all the books Falk has in his home library here in Princeton, he must have purchased this one. Where's his response? Or would he rather forget his participation in this world-history-changing event? Further, there's nothing that would give a readers even a clue that the leak of the Pentagon Papers begat the downfall of Richard Nixon -- not just Watergate! Shame on you, Rudenstine!"
4,gospel,"Great for church outings and Campmeeting. Also for traveling with a church group. Not the best for the short trip to church, because you don't want to leave the car."
5,love it,"I would recommend this CD for a friend or as a gift for anyone.I enjoy it,I play it when I am busy,it helps me get things done."
2,Disappointing,"I found this CD to be very disappointing. I appreciate listening to the harmony of the group but on this CD the high tenor part was was akin to fingernails grating on a blackboard. I enjoyed the song, Just in Time, Daddy Sang Bass and most of How Great Thou Art, but on several of the others there was too much talking rathers than singing. I Listened to the clips of the songs prior to purchase, however, those clips contained the nice harmony."
2,Did not work.,Tested it on myself and it did not seem to work. I checked the ingredients and they are the same as regular root beer candy. At least the candy tasted decent.
2,Wouldn't reccommend.,Didn't work.. I tried it on both of my siblings. They had no reaction. All they said was: Mmmm! Thanks for the candy.
2,Good as review for sematicists; Bad as a textbook,"This would probably serve as an excellent review for those who have studied semantics and need to be reminded/updated on important topics. As a textbook for novices, though, it is very poor. The text is not written with ease of reading in mind (technical formulas are frequently used to explain points that would be much better explained in words). Technical terms are used without definitions, and the excercises require the reader to have not only understood the material completely, but to have read between the lines and filled in the gaps in the explanations. There are many typos and there are structural problems as well (use of endnotes instead of footnotes, no comprehensive biliography...). If you have already done quite a lot of semantics, this book may be of use to you; if you are thinking of using it as a class text or as a way to teach yourself this subject, look elsewhere."
4,I bloody loved it!,She did it again! Another great read written by Carmen Reid. I enjoyed the organic farmer insight too - so fun! Who doesn't want to grow their own stuff!
3,Second...,"I have to agree with the other poster that these break very easily - they sound great, are dirt cheap, and snap off right at the earpiece - if they were one piece all around I don't think they would have this problem, but the connection point is simply weak... don't put them in a bag or backpack or anything, they will come out much worse for wear =)."
3,"Great headphones, but break easily.","I purchased a set of these a year ago for running, and they held up for about 6 mos. and then broke off at the earpiece. I taped them for a couple mos. until I could track down another pair. I thought I was just hard on em', but the same thing happend on this 2nd pair after only 3 wks. Upsides: I love the weight, sound, and vol. control. Downsides: wish the cord were shorter, and they were more durable. I've now switched to Jenson headphones of a similar style, but they're too tight...but at least they don't break. If Koss made a more durable set of these, I'd snatch em' up in a second."
4,Good for running,"Ok, first off these are under $10 headphones so I wasn't expecting very much for them. I wanted a pair of headphones that would stay in my ears when I run and were cheap enough so if they got broken it would be no big loss. I wasn't expecting much else from them. But I wound up being rather impressed.Pros+ Cheap, their less then $10 USD.+ Stay in my ears when I run, this for me at least is a huge plus!+ Sound quality is decent for price, you won't be blown away by the sound but I've heard $30 headphones that sound worse.+ Inline volume controlCons- They may rub against your ears if your not careful when you put them in- The back of them is not adjustable, not a huge deal but does make them awkward to wear when I wear my hood up in the rain."
3,Good product...for a couple of months,"I have been buying these for many years as I like the way they stay put, for the most part, behind your neck. I also like that you can control the volume! The price is great.I work out everyday with them and they have a shelf life of about 6 - 8 months max.One of the ear pieces usually come off after this amount of time.Also, if you are doing stomach crunches, or anything on where you are lying down, they will slide off."
2,Koss P9 Headphones,"Good sound quality, but I found them very cumbersome to put on and were somewhat uncomfortable while wearing. Discontinued using them and bought another pair."
2,Sound good - fit is awkward,"I really prefer vertical in-ear headphones - they don't block out surrounding sounds completely, and are less likely to damage ears with too much volume.The sound quality of these Koss headphones is decent for the price - no problems there.The fit, on the other hand, is very awkward, especially for smaller ears. The speakers are large and the edges are rough, making for an uncomfortable fit.Also the back-of-the-head band is NOT adjustable, so all-around, it's a bad fit for anyone not of the largest build.Your money's better spent on the Sony vertical, ADJUSTABLE, headphones - style #MDR W08L"
1,never again,"I have had great sucess with other behind the neck headphones until now, when i put these on the ear piecese came out of the headset Iknow they were cheap but needed to use tape from the gym just to get through one workout never again"
3,Poor time usage,After one week of use the headphones broke ???? The price was very low and I did not feel they would last long but one week ????
1,Poor product.,Saw some good review and thought I would give it a try.This is at best a children's toy. I can't even put it in my ear 'cos it hurts and it looks too fragile. Poorly designed head phones.Never been able to use it.You'll be better off giving the money to the poor!
2,Not very good,They do not fit well. Hurts the ear when used for a little while. The phones ends are plastic rather than rubber not very comfortable especially used while working out.
3,Koss P9 In-Ear Headphones,This is by far the best of this type of headphone(reasonably priced) out there.Obviously they don't sound as good as the high end products.I bought them as a gift for my mother and she thinks they're wonderful.They're pretty sturdy as compared to others at this price as well.Can't beat them for the price.
2,Not for running.,"I wore these yesterday for the first and last time. I bought these headphones in hopes that they would stay in or at least near my ears when running. They didn't last one minute.They are very light, but at the same time very flimsy. The over-ear design does nothing in the way of supporting the buds in you ears like I had hoped.The buds are set at an awkward angle and found myself having a hard time, even when stationary, keeping them in or on my ears.As far as sound, holding them on my ears they sounded terrific albeit very uncomfortable. Holding them in place also pretty much defeats the purpose of having headphones. Another thing to be noted, the volume control on the cord is a terrible idea. The volume pod itself probably weighs as much as the headphones. Unless the volume control is secured somehow it is very problematic doing any sort of activity.These are probably what to expect out of a $10 set of headphones.Comfort: 1/10Sound: 6/10Design: 2/10Cost-benefit: 3/10"
3,"Okay, but they don't last long...","These are pretty nice headphones for the price. But after less than six months of regular use, the sound is now very distorted and I can't use them."
4,Fine for mobile use,"I picked up these headphones to use with an iPod. They do exactly what I want them to do: allow me to listen to music without having to worry about keeping track of an expensive pair of earbuds or headphones.I think the sound quality is decent, with the caveat that I don't like hearing a lot of bottom end and I use AAC-encoded files on my iPod. Consequently, I don't need audiophile quality headphones for mobile listening. When I want to hear great sound, I listen to my home stereo (yes, that's incredibly old school, I know).Bottom line: a good value, as long as you're willing to live with the limitations of a pair of cheap headphones. If you want noise canceling, mega bass response, or something flashy to impress your friends, the Koss P9 isn't for you."
2,They are nothing special,"These head phones don't fall ot your ear when your exercising, and thats y I got them. But thats all there good for. You can't just relax if your head is back against a bed or sofa. Its even uncomfortable to lay on a weight bench."
2,Don't buy these,"It only took 5 seconds to figure out these are terrible headphones. They hurt inside your ears. The reason is simple. They're made of hard plastic and have a small ridge all the way around the part that goes inside your ear canal. I'm sure some people feel no discomfort but don't risk it. My ears are probably average sized. If yours are smaller you will definitely be in pain. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning these, I'll try to sand down those ridges and see if that helps. Don't bother with these. I marked them 2 stars instead of 1 because they may fit some users. Hard to imagine how this product ever got beyond the test stage where at least one person put them on before saying ""ok, let's order 100.000 of these""."
4,Pretty neat,"I confess, I have only dipped through most of this book, reading in depth the parts that come up in my discussions. Those, such as Tyndale, are straighforward and clear. I see many Catholics below who are ashamed that this author would spend so much time on ""outlandish and rare anti-Catholic claims that I have never heard."" Then I saw that these people are all northerners. Well, from my very southern bible-belt point of view, these claims are not rare! I hear them every day! Those who have not heard them before, be glad. I have appreciated very much the dissection of these very popular falsehoods."
2,Save your 5 bucks,"I'm surprised to see the reviews of this book splitting along Catholic-Protestant lines. I'm Catholic, and this is not a good book. Too much anti-Protestant drooling and not enough useful information.From the title it sounds as if it's going to give a brief history of the Bible, but instead it merely attempts to debunk the most outlandish of the anti-Catholic accusations wrt the Bible in the most rabidly anti-Protestant manner possible. If it has any value it's as a catalogue of ridiculous anti-Catholic propaganda--most of this stuff I'd never heard of--but honestly, who cares? I want to learn about the Bible; I don't need a session of Daily Catholic Affirmation with Stuart Smalley."
5,Clearing away the fog of Protestantism,"Right Reverend Graham presents us with clear and concise evidence that the current claims of the majority of anti-Catholics regarding the Catholic Church and Scripture are patently false!!! As with most other issues, these Catholic haters try to twist history to destroy the Church. Graham shows us the facts that prove the true ""Bible"" church is the Roman Catholic Church.Though not intended to be overly scholarly (he leaves most of the validation of the facts to us), this is a very powerful witness to the truth from a time when men weren't afraid to proclaim the truth. May the Holy Spirit continue to raise up defenders of the Church founded by Jesus Christ!!"
1,blatant ignorance,"Catholic translations prior to Luther spoke of faith alone at Romans 3:28. Hence, the Nuremberg Bible of 1483 had ""allein durch den glauben,"" while the Italian Bibles of Geneva in 1476 and even 1538 had ""per sola fede."" Luther added the qualifier 'alone'. However, this was neither a complete innovation nor a real falsification, for the translation of the Bible that appeared in 1483 had rendered Galatians 2:16: ""justified only by faith"". Three Italian editions of Scripture (Genoa, 1476; Venice, 1583 and 1546) offered a similar translation. The author is clearly not qualified to give an accurate portrait of biblical historicity. As another reviewer commented, this book is typically appealing to the teenage level 'apologist'."
5,A very good mystery,"Aside from being a well written mystery, this story opened my eyes to the perils of over-development and the aquifer situation. I was very impressed with her wealth of knowledge."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the book (and this series). I thought I had found a new author to read but it turns out these are just romance novels dressed up as ""mysteries"". Romance readers should like them."
3,Dressed-up beginner's book ...'Bead on a Wire' recommended instead.,"I was disappointed with this book because it had the same info with less design ideas, as 'Bead on a Wire' by Sharilyn Miller. To be fair, if I had bought this book first, instead of vice-a-versa, I might not have felt as let down as I was; but, I don't think so...All the wire designs seem to be based on one theme--the two, three or four 'Loop Eye' headpin, and how to string beads.The book should have BEGINNER'S somewhere on the front cover. If you have already have a book listing the basic tools & techniques, you don't need this one."
2,Did not care for this book,"I found this very uninspiring and it offered very few designs. Very long descriptions of very simple elements. This book may be helpful to some, but it really wasn't interesting to me at all."
2,Making Designer Bead & Wire Jewelry,Somewhat disappointing - too general. I probably will not ever open it again.
3,Fil from LYF Designs,This is an excellent book for beginners with beautiful but simple designs to inspire
3,Works wonderful except for one flaw,"This thing works well as long as you are using original cds or cd-r media. MP3 and audio playback was great. Once you insert a CD-RW media things take a turn for the worst. Whether you burn as a audio cd or as an MP3 cd, the playback is full of pops, crackles and interruptions. If you use CD-RWs then avoid this player, otherwise it will serve you well."
2,"Cute, but lacks functionality","Upon receipt, unit appeared just great, but it would not play retail recorded language instruction discs. It played my home-burned MP3 discs for about a month, and one day when I went to actuate the unit, there was a loud ""crack"" and the line output ceased to function. Spend a few bucks more and get a better unit."
1,Rooked by RCA,"I'm here to attest to the fact that it's not just cdr's that this piece of junk won't play. All I've ever put in it were store bought cds. Worked for a month. Now, I put it in, hear the noise like it's reading the disc and then NOTHING. It tells me there's an error. $25 for complete junk.I didn't save the receipt. I hope Wal-Mart will at least let me exchange it, although for what - another crappy unit."
1,RCA RP2520 MP3 Personal CD Player - Red,"At first I thought I was the problem, but after reading other reviews I realize it's the machine. It plays, then stops, then there's silence, then it skeps to the next number, then it repeats the whole process all over again and then sometimes it turns itself off! I only wanted a CD player -- I liked the red color that's why I bought it. I did not realize it was an MP3 player - not for me! It is very frustrating!"
1,RCA MP3 Personal CD Player,"Good afternoon, your people send me at the incorrectly address and for that I don't have my cd Player.If you send me the Cd player to the following address.JOSE RAMON MERA CURYEPS X-185647801 N. W. 37th StreetMiami FL. 33166-6559I can tell you about the cd, Thanks."
1,I need some help...,"I need help, i have this video dock and an ipod 120 gb classic 6th generation but i can't see anything on my tv or listen on my home theater system, i have tried everything. Can anyone helpme?. I need to know how set my ipod and the dock for watch the videos and listen the music on the tv.Thanxs"
4,A little-known episode of history typifies true courage.,"This scholarly and well-researched account of the last ditch effort by a band of Luftwaffe pilots to ram American bombers from the skies is fascinating. What strikes this reader most is how the motivation of these pilots dispels so many of the myths that German pilots were motivated by a fanatical allegiance to their Fuhrer. On the contrary, these courageous men flew for the same reasons allied pilots flew -- to save their homeland and families. In fact, they exhibited more courage than some of the American fighter pilots who shot several bailed Schulungslehrgang Elbe pilots as they were helplessly dangling from their parachutes! The sacrifice and courage of these Luftwaffe pilots against all odds is human drama more visceral than any fiction could hope to depict."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This book is literally the best one I have ever read. I have read many other authors and books, one of then being Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. None even come close to this book in it's entirety. I felt like I had known the characters, from soup to nuts, my entire life. Also this book does not lack any action. I read Lord of the Rings(like I said before) and it was not even close to having even a little bit of the action in The Darkest Day. I stayed up all night reading this book. And like all other books The Darkest Day gives you something to think of while you regret that you read it too fast. It gives people, in my opinion, Moral lessons. In my everyday life I think about excerts from The Darkest Day, I might start a conversation or I might change my actions for the better. I can't stress enough how good this book is, for a first read, second read, and for so many more reads. Totally Truthfully, Brandon"
3,A story told by someone you'd never suspect,"A story line you can connect with, told from the inside, by someone you'd never suspect. The kids in that household must have lived in great horror. Where were the teachers, the social workers, that could have helped these kids. This book shows the corrosion of society. Bravo to Ruth Forrest Glenn, I will look forward to more fast paced reading from this author."
1,Exploitation,"As someone who lives in the town written about in this book,I find it to be nothing more than an exploitation of actual people who live and have lived here, including the author's Mother and Father. It's very sad that she is making money offof their troubled lives. I also think she could improve as a writer."
1,Not worth your time,Worst written book I have ever read. Characters names are to close to the actual people. Didn't take me long to know exactly who she was talking about. Author must be terrible insecure. Would not read any other book by this author.
4,A fast moving account of a family in turmoil.,"This book grabbed my attention right from the start. I read it over the course of a few evenings, eager to know what would happen next. This is a portrait of extreme manipulation and deceit on the part of adults who ignore the harm they do to innocent children. It is a dark account of passion allowed to destroy a family while a whole town watched."
3,words from the hometown,The book has sold well in the town this story takes place and there is much demand for the second book. The local bookstore would like to hear from the author. Is a book signing possible? We'd like to hold it but we need some communication.
4,ML-2552 SMB Network Printer,"We have used four of these for our small business network in the past several years. Two have been lost to electrical storms. But, this printer is a little workhorse. Easy to network and easy to service.It also supports Linux."
1,Wrong product-no replacement,"This product came through Amazon from allchildrencanlearn. In the actual cartridge were all R&B songs, not the soft rock we ordered. Amazon said to contact allchildrencanlearn. allchildrencanlearn said they were not responsible for the wrong packaging, would offer no refund or replacement, and that my only option was to contact the manufacturer. Since the people who actually sold this product to me will not stand behind their product, I am out of pocket $35.00 and I must give it a zero rating."
2,Disapointed,"The over all game is not to bad, but steering the reuck is a huge challange. One big issues that we had with it was while you was in the middle of playing it would freeze then take you back to the begining fo the game.For children this could be fun game..... I know both my 11 year old and 4 year love playing this game...."
1,Good Idea....,"I like the concept. 18 wheeler in the arcade is a fun game...this game gets old real quick... the graphics are lame...the characters mouths don't even move while they talk. This isn't an atari 2600 game fer chrissakes! The music gets irritating extremely fast, the trucks are hard as hell to control, the routine is new for about 15 minutes then its just an endless cycle. I bought this game, got it on a Friday, gave it away on saturday. In my opinion, even for the cost, it isn't worth it."
3,"A painful story of betrayal, part confession, part revenge.","OK, this book is not well written, but that's not the point. You will enjoy it if you have even the slightest voyeuristic tendency, which I believe most people do. The author discusses some very private matters in (sometimes) excruciating detail. I think she wrote the book partly as therapy for herself, but I also think she wanted to stick it to the guy and his new girlfriend, who, contrary to what another reviewer just below me says, seem quite happy together (http://www.....edu/news/news.html). This is not to say that I wasn't profoundly moved by her pain and her loss. I was not convinced by her interpretation of the events, and her endless psychologizing, but I think she really just needed to explain everything to herself, in order to be able to move on with her life. I hope she does."
5,"Excellent, honest discussion of infidelity","From the start I could not put this book down. Ms. Perlman dealt with issues that her mother and grandmother before her could not. In spite of the odds already facing her biracial marriage in a less tolerant time, she and Ty seemed to have made it work - only to find that, it didn't. An engrossing read and a must-have book for anyone struggling to understand problems in their own relationship, or perhaps of those they love."
5,don't confess,"Wow, this woman carried the cross of her husband's ""infidelity"" with incredible gusto. Her incessant nagging and whining, and the self-serving hysterics she imposed on her household, including her young daughter, should serve as a warning to any man with an IQ of more than 80 and a little warm blood running thorough his veins. Men: If you're gonna screw around, don't confess!"
1,Not worth the effort,"Time and time again I found myself tempted to put the book down. It was a sad story, but not very interesting. In addition, the book was very poorly written. I can understand why a shrink would enjoy this book, but if you are a normal person looking for an interesting read keep searching."
5,Quality,This is a solid well made tool that works as it is supposed to. I have owned tweezerman products for years and never been disappointed. Will last a lifetime.
5,"Cool Game, lots of fun","Great game, I've been reading Justice League on comic for a long time. My kid, who is 5 years old, watch JL on cartoon network, he loves it. His favorite is Batman, we gave him this game on Christmas and he loves it. As a matter of fact, now we both fight for the game boy to play the game. It's a lot of fun."
4,Justice League game - lots of fun,"We got our 4 year old son a Gameboy Advance SP for Christmas and since he LOVES the justice league we got this game for him. I was a little concerned that either the Gameboy or the game itself would be too advanced for him but he is loving it. It did not take a lot of time at all for him to master the controls. There are screens that show dialog we have to read to him but when he is playing he is completely absorbed and he is having a wonderful time.Not sure how this compares to other Gameboy games since this is our first one but our son loves it. We have to wrestle the game away from him and he has been very well behaved knowing if he is not, then he will not be allowed to play. We are really glad we bought the Gameboy and this game. We will be trying other games."
1,Many inaccurate transliterations,"As others have noted, it is not useful for individuals who wish to learn the Khmer language or for those who wish to communicate in Khmer. Many of the words are misspelled in Khmer and phonetically inaccurate. This book is only useful for basic words. Very limited in clarifying multiple definitions for individual words. It is best to purchase a more comprehensive dictionary."
1,"Ditto ""A Reader"" response","The review made by ""A Reader"" couldn't have said it better. 9 times out of ten the word you want is not there and the translations are often bad. NOT a good reference under any circumstances."
2,OK for basic words but a liability,"This small dictionary seems to be modelled on Robertson's Thai dictionary. In this context it is light years ahead of its model. But it is next to useless for all but very basic vocab. Be warned too, that nine times out of ten the word you are stuck for will not be there, and if perchance it is, there will be no help at all on usage. The transliteration is terrible and often misleading or wrong. Be careful too because the meanings are likely to also be sufficiently incomplete or even wrong to create some embarrassment. Not very useful for anybody wanting to communicate in Khmer, and completely inadequate for anybody wanting to learn the language."
2,Disappointing,"This dictionary has proven a great disappointment in my Cambodian language study: the English-Khmer section has only the most basic entries, while the transliterated Khmer-English section is utterly useless. I have pulled this book out countless times in conversations and during listening practice to search for words that I hear over and over, only to come up empty-handed. It is not completely useless, however, so if you can get it for under $4 (shipping included), go for it!For serious students of Cambodian, I have encountered many different dictionaries in markets around Phnom Pehn and would recommend purchasing a dictionary in-country, if you have that option.Happy studying!"
3,Interesting history behind the making of this film,"John Wayne is a tough-talking air force colonel who ends up falling in love with Soviet defector Janet Leigh, who has some secrets of her own. The film is a nice mixture of action (with wonderful shots of the US Air Force in action performing various flight maneuvers), romance, and comedy. The dialogue is a little clunky at times, but still, it's a good, romantic adventure that has two of America's favorite screen legends: The Duke & Ms. Leigh.In a side note about this film, in her autobio, ""There Really Was A Hollywood"", Ms. Leigh wrote that this film was made in 1950. However, eccentric millionaire producer Howard Hughes kept making changes to the film by tinkering with special effects and miniatures, even having the actors refilm scenes two years later. The picture didn't get released until 1957."
3,Ok...,"I am on the fence about these hi-liters. I feel that they do work ok, but they run out of ink so quickly that I think that I could've purchased a better product. They work wonderfully on shiny textbook pages, but you can forget about using them on regular printer paper."
5,Great Classic,Great Classic move relating to WW 2. Enjoyed it so much wanted to add to my collection so that others could view.
3,"far, far from Minnelli's masterpices","far, far from Minnelli's masterpices like HOME FROM THE HILL(Con el llegó el escàndalo) or SOME CAME RUNNING(Como un torrente)talking of melodramas, but a mew Minnelli film on DVD, ALWAYS it's interesting.I'm tring to do a COMPLETE Minnelli's collection, and I'm waiting for TEA AND SIMPATHY(Te y simpatia),GOODBYE CHARLIE(adios Charly),THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE(Mama nos complica la vida), and specially TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN(Dos semanas en otra ciudad).Please, Mrs.Producers, don't forgett this tittles. Many people are waiting for. I put the spanish tittles because in Spain some of the Minnelli's films, apear on DVD, before here that in Usa, with the wonderfull soundtrack of ESTUDIOS METRO who dubbed the films into spanish lenguage.Thanks"
4,just perfect,i got this for when i was living in a home with very little space but wanted to take advantage of the free cable TV that came with my internet connection. the image quality is perfectly sufficient and the look of it is just adorable. the fact that the controller looks like a ladybug just kills me.
3,Hack and Slash,"Hack and Slash your way through six worlds, fighting other gladiators, monsters and skeletons. As you progress you can either choose to do mini games and increase heath, recieve new weapons and unlock new magical powers or continue on. The game is repetitive and seems like you are doing the same old thing over and over again. Kill some creatures, find a key, pull a lever and fight a boss. The graphics are cool and the best things about the game are fighting multiple opponants, execution movies and different weapon combos. Not the best game ive played but fun enough for me to spend hours playing it."
1,Messy!!,So very messy! I do not recommend this stamp at all. I used in the office for a week and I'm STILL trying to get the ink off my fingers.
3,"Effective, but can be messy","I purchased this as a backup to a heavier-duty stamp. It's lightweight and the print quality is excellent. However, the small size of the dials is awkward and I ended up with ink on my fingers at least once a week when I was using it regularly. U.S. Stamp and Sign's Trodat E4817 (with slightly different messages) turned out to be a better choice for me. The Trodat stamp isn't as compact and feels flimsier, but at least my fingers are clean."
2,Old product only two years left,"The product was older and only had two years left to use on the date stamp. When you change the labeler, some of the ink would come out, which makes it messy and it gets on your fingers. I have bought and used this product before and it did not have this problem. The price without shipping was okay but I would not have bought it, if I had known about the ink problem and date."
1,Basically useless,"I bought this book in preparation for a trip to China. In the end, I didn't even bring it with me. It only deals with the neighborhood of Beijing and Tianjin - nothing at all about the more rewarding sections of the wall that are to be found further west. If you have the Lonely Planet books, you do not need this one, in fact, it tells you less than LP about getting to the wall independently."
4,wonderful darkwave release,from famous German darkwave label HYPERIUM. havenly voice with beautiful female singer. very melodic with some kind of mediaeval elements. very difficult to find it now on the market. strongly recommends.
1,Incompatible,This muffler is listed as being compatible with a 1989 Honda prelude.According to the manufacturer (Walker Exhaust) it is not compatible with the 1989 Honda Prelude SI with four wheel steering (4WS).Walker Exhaust 54123 Muffler Assembly-Quiet-FlowSS
3,iPod,"It's a good product, but i'll prefered other with a hole protection including the conector side."
3,review,It was not as thick of a material as I thought it would be. There was no cover for the screen.
4,Clarifies the boundaries between work and home,"Lazear focuses on his own experiences while discussing specifically how American males often confuse their personal lives with their professional ones. He attempts to teach his readers to allow for time with their families, friends, and lives outside of the workplace. This book has no comedic tone and yet based on the title and approach one would expect it.."
3,Bratz forever Diamondz,This item was for my granddaughter and she is very pleased with it. It is fun for he rbecause she dows not know that much about the Dolls (Bratz)thanks
3,So-So,I tried to play this game. It was easy. The maze was hard and the beading mini game was slow working. The story line is good. I liked the clothes. I think its alright if your younger. The game is ok. The tv show is worst.
4,Growing Pains,"Sheila Peele-Miller wonderfully captures a young woman's growing pains. This is a true example of ""what looks good, is not always good for us."" I felt myself feeling bad for Alicia. She loved so hard, but Derek was damaged goods. Hopefully he learned something at the cost of losing most likely the best woman he ever had. I enjoyed reading ""Painted Picture.""B. RichardsonGAAL Book Club of Atlanta"
2,The Crayola Brigade,"Me and my friends played x-com 1 for years and then 2, we were addicted to it, we loved them without bounds, we even built our own replicas of the guns (well tried anyway, we were 11) and ran around making our own sound effects.But then came this abomination, everything but the weapons looks designed by a bunch of kindergarteners using the brightest crayons they could find! What were they thinking?!Don't get me started about the aliens.However I must say the gameplay itself isn't too bad, I particularly liked the way ""outo-shot"" was done, so you can actually strafe a group of targets.Honestly, if ALL the visuals were changed I think it would be a very decent game, I'm not crazy about the ""City"" idea but that's not so much an issue.In short, if you can overlook...err...everything, you can have fun, I simply could not swallow the way EVERYTHING looks,x-com1 was the pinnacle of creation."
1,"Hey the aliens have landed! No bus fare, lets walk to them.","I have wondered excatly how this game got released. The graphics are a step back from the orignial X-Com (the higher the resolution the better it should look). Turn based is incredibly difficult, and real-time is, well, real-time. *dead face* This game is so bad it wasn't on my computer long enough to find out if it had the research & manufacturing of X-Coms 1&2. The game takes place in the city and you actually see your forces walking to the battlefield, I feel like my elite UN troops are hitch-hiking, while the world is in trouble."
2,Shot by Uncle Bob...,"Well at least we have motorcycle videos to choose from now...even if it looks like my Uncle Bob shot and edited the video. The video is somewhat informative, but his accent, video quality, and lack of documented lists are distracting to it's quality. In regards to the last comment...here's one example...he says he is going to share his tool set with you and lays it out in front of himself and proceeds to talk about it for 1 minute and then moves on to great products from his sponsors. Did you get all that?! Ahhhh...being that I paid for the video could you have a screen list that I could freeze-frame on; or a printed document? Or is specifics going to be covered in the book (rolls eyes). I bought this video to learn from a pro...so would I buy another of his quality videos? Simply...no."
3,"It's okay, that's all... Buy ""Powerdrome"" first.","I use the cheat codes you can find online to play my copy of ""XGRA"". The game just doesn't seem interesting enough in any way, to go through a full effort to unlock all tracks, vehicles & modes of play. It is kinda tasty eye candy, but nowhere NEAR as sweet as the ""Powerdrome"" graphics for Xbox. Get yourself a CHEAP copy of ""Powerdrome"" (they are so easy to find) & you will enjoy this genre as it should be experienced."
5,Ambient Pillow,"Ambient Holofiber Standard PillowI recently purchased two Ambient Holofiber Pillows after hearing on a popular talk show, that it was a great product and it could help with insomnia. True to the host's word the pillows are luxurious. They are very soft, yet very supportive. You know that the pillow is under your head. It almost contours to your head and the way you lay. It is not shaped like usual pillows. It's almost like a perfect rectangle. I love the way they look. I love sleeping on my pillows and I love folding it sometimes under neath my head. The only thing that I was disappointed about was that the talk show host claimed that it helped with insomnia. That is a misnomer. I suppose tho, when one has a comfortable pillow, it can't but help with sleep."
2,Just an average pillow - nothing special,"I tried this pillow out for a good long time, and to me, it doesn't feel any different from any other pillows that I've tried. There's nothing magical about it - it's just an average pillow. In fact, I don't even use it anymore, because it seems to have lost some of it's firmness."
1,Not at all what it claims to be,"I purchased one of these and i think it is terrible. It is like sleeping on a flat cheap pillow. Like the other poster said, save your money and go buy a $5 pillow from wal-mart! I bought it because i had headaches terrible when i would wake. So thought i would give it a try. Well, still have headaches and have had much better pillows than this."
2,ambient pillow,i've only had this pillow one month and already it is starting to sag. Not that impressed.
4,"Ambient Holofiber King Pillow comfortable, but","did not hold it's shape for very long. I bought it because it was ranked as one of the best pillows on Oprah. It did alleviate some of the tension I was feeling in my neck, which is the reason I needed it, but I just wish it would have held it's initial shape a little longer, because initially it was AWESOME! I have bought every type of pillow at every price range, and none have worked as good as this one. I think pillows are an individual's choice anyway. But, I would buy another one when this one finally wears out."
1,Wrong product - horrible packing,"First of all this was not the product I ordered - it was a cheaper model of it. Second, the packages the two pillows each arrived in looked like somebody had put them in the street and backed over them. It was the worst packaging job I have ever seen. I really wanted this product and was disappointed to see what a mess the whole thing was."
3,"Comfortable, Yes; Energizing? I think not.","This is a comfortable, well-made pillow, but the claims that its holo-tech will leave you energized? Well let's just say bwah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I loved reading the literature for entertainment value and plan to hang on to it to amuse my friends. I'm very happy with the pillow itself - no complaints there."
3,a little firm for me,"This is a good pillow for the money but it's a bit firmer than a down pillow. I haven't noticed any benefits from the holofiber yet such as sleeping better or waking up more alert but that could be because I don't usually sleep on it, preferring my softer down pillow."
5,A real winner,"This was recommended by a sleep specialist on the TV show, The View. I was skeptical but since we needed new pillows I decided that it was worth a try. I was absolutely amazed at how comfortable the pillow was and how my head and nose were clear when I woke in the morning. I also sleep much better than I did before. Highly recommended!"
2,I immediately regret my decision.... wish I'd been able to flip through before buying,"I was so excited about this ""comprehensive"" guide but it's not what I hoped for.Too much space is spent on Beck's opinions of the films (most of which I don't agree with) instead of discussing the lesser known animated films. I bought it to help me remember the movies of my childhood but I've had better luck with blogs and youtube in finding The Point, Unico and others."
2,Cheap Price but Lacking Quality,"I purchased this wallet a few years ago. When I first got it I could tell it was not the greatest quality, but for the price I was happy. I guess you get what you pay for. The wallet lasted about two years before some of the stitching came undone. For the price I really can't complain about the wallet, but I will purchase a higher quality product that may cost a little more, but will last longer next time."
2,Not what I expected,"I use the eraser on my pencils a lot so I specifically bought this pencil for the retractable eraser. The eraser on this pencil isn't the same diameter of most retractable eraser pencils and I wish I would have noticed this from the picture. Also, most of these types of pencils that I've used allow you to press as hard as you want while erasing without inadvertently clicking the lead out. You can't do that with this one because the design doesn't allow you to grip the sizes of the moving part. With a few changes in the design, this would be a great pencil."
1,Harrison's in America,this book was awful and i returned it and got credit. it lists home addresses for harrison's from about 1997. it did nothing to detail lineage.
5,Great and deserving champions!,"Call the Spurs boring, call them the ""asterisk"" team, call them dirty (The Spurs? Dirty?), call them whatever as long as you call them champions! Whoever thought that a small-market, fundamentally sound, not very exciting team led by a not very exciting superstar (Tim Duncan) would be a posible NBA dynasty? Not very many but guess what, it's a good thing! It's refreshing that a classy organization like the San Antinio Spurs are here to show everybody else that it isn't fancy slam dunking, showing out, tattoos, ESPN highlights, having a superstar with a fancy name or ""street cred"" that wins championships but unselfishness, fundamentals, defense and good all around team play that gets the job done! Go Spurs Go!"
5,NBA 2007 Champs,This DvD was outstanding. I LOVE my spurs and this DVD hit the spot in recounting thier championship season.
1,Mindless Meandering,"I read ""Murderous Methods"" expecting to learn how forensic science was used to help solve puzzling cases. Instead, the book contained cases often unrelated to the technique under discussion. Some were solved simply by the perpetrator being turned in by someone else, and even involved instances where the criminal's identity was obvious.Boring."
3,"English, French and Fractured Spanish","If you want to infuse your house with Island Flavor, this CD will certainly do it. Toussaint's lilting voice and appealing accent will have you imagining virtual ocean breezes and humming along to familiar melodies tropically renedered. However, if you speak Spanish, singing along will present a real challenge. Several of the songs; especially Cu Cu Ru Cu Cu Paloma, have taken on a Fractured Fairy Tale aspect. The lyrics are all there (sort of) but it is like they have been cut and pasted randomly together. Other songs insert or delete the final ""s"" on words creating odd verb endings.The last song on the album , Granada, comes to a sudden halt mid-song as if they just plain ran out of room. As long as you care more about the melody than the lyrics, you will enjoy this album..."
5,The Last Pendragon-A Riveting Tale of Arthur II!,"This book tells the tale of the continuation of the Pendragon line and of Arthur II named for his famous ancestor, the original Arthur.Death and deceit await Arthur II at every turn. He never knows who he can trust and his reign begins even before he is crowned the new king of Camelot. Rebellions and hardship follow but the people of Arthur's realm continue to fight back for the last of the Pendragons.This tale was an exciting read, a real page turner! Anyone who follows Arthurian Literature will quickly be enamored of this book written by the author when he was only 15 years old! I hope we hear more from him! Outstanding first effort! (However, the typos at times were very distracting and the book needs to be cleaned up in this regard)."
3,nice sports watch....for a woman.,"This watch was categorized as mens', but it is tiny....not for a man at all. This is not what we needed."
1,too small,This watch is so small that I gave it to my nine year old nephew. I had bought if for my husband. We had a good laugh when he opened it. It didn't even fit around my wrist and I have small wrists.
1,Don't wear in water.,"Stopped working 2 days after purchasing and after submersing in a swimming pool for 5 minutes. Watch is dead now, my kid is sad. I'm out over $30. Good lesson for him though, don't believe advertising."
4,"Not a mens watch, too small","I was looking for a replacement for my old expedition watch, chose this one because of the colors and band. I should have heeded the other reviews, this watch is for women or children. It it a great watch but looks silly on my wrist, it is very small. I could have sent it back but keeping it for the wife or daughter instead."
4,Perfect for a young boy.,We needed a good first watch for our 8 year old and this fits the bill. The smaller diameter fits his wrist well but it is very masculine. He loves announcing the time.
4,nice watch,Great little bang around watch for work and play outside...it is waterproof with running water in a sink..inexpensive...would purchase again
1,DEFECTIVE INDIGLOS MAKES THIS WATCH UNREADABLE UNDER ANY CONDITIONS,"THIS IS THE SECOND WATCH OF THIS MODEL THAT I HAVE HAD WITHIN 6 MONTHS WHERE THE INDIGLO FEATURE HAS FAILED. WHEN THERE IS NO LONGER ANY INDIGLO BACK LIGHTING THE WATCH IS UNREADABLE IN EITHER NIGHT OR DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS, RENDERING IT COMPLETELY USELESS. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT AFTER TWO TRIES THIS IS A BASICALLY DEFECTIVE DESIGN AND TIMEX SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE A RELIABLE BACK LIGHTING SYSTEM. AS IT STANDS, THE WATCH IS JUNK."
3,Band too short,"I don't have any problem with the watch itself. But, the band is far too short. The circumference of my wrist is 7 inches. I am barely able to secure the band. Since the leather band on another Timex watch broke off after just a few months I thought I'd give the velcro closure a try. I'll have to look at a different brand of watch in the future for a longer lasting, better fitting band."
2,Average,Its ok fun to shoot but camera angle wont let you see people shooting at you from side can be hard but its fun.
4,AWESOME GAME,"This game is awesome because of the many vehicles you can control/transform into. You have a HUGE arsenal of weapons for your car, which you can upgrade and use for further missions. This game rulez!! The only drawback is that there is no Difficulty Level."
5,Very Cool,When I ordered this I was a little unsure about it. It arrived and is very cool. My son has it on display with his other figures
2,"Good idea, poorly presented","I understand what Bob Flaws was shooting for with this book. Chinese medicine is built upon short statements that have withstood the test of time, although they come from many sources throughout the long history of traditional Chinese medicine. However it is only a little booklet full of these statements.If I had my druthers, I would take each one of these ""statements of fact"" such as ""Liver stores the blood"" and add a clinical application such as ""because the Liver stores the blood, it is implicated in menstrual irregularities or any condition that is coincidental with the menstrual cycle."" Something like that."
3,Be aware of book pictured,"The book I ordered (pictured) was not the book I received. There are apparently 2 (or more) books with the same ISBN. One book (pictured) is 230 pages, and the other (older version) is 130 pages and NOT updated or expanded. The older book is still a good read though."
5,Discover for yourself this musical gem!,"As a fan of Kooper's music, I was pleasantly surprised at this, instrumental offering! A great mixture of get-down,blues,jazz,and rock. Kooper's playing like he's having the time of his life, and the enthusiasim shines right through! First rate sidemen, make this a crisp, enjoyable jam! Put this one on with a crowd of people,and you'll be sure to turn heads, and get some toe-tapping going! This is one you'll love playing over and over! Definately a winner! If your'e a fan of Kooper,or if you never heard him, TRY THIS ONE OUT! Your'e sure to love it!!!"
4,re kooperation by al kooper,"Very good album,a little raw in places but have to tolerate the time and style for when it was produced.Glad that I purchased it,thank you Amazon.Dan"
4,The evolution of the Myst series,"Having played the original Myst and Riven, I have watched the technological advancements with awe. Exile has spectacular scenery and the added feature of 360 panning really brought you into the game. The music was enchanting as always. I found the puzzles in many places a bit overwhelming. While I was able to move through the Myst\Riven puzzles with a little thought and persistance, alot of Exile's puzzles were very complicated to me. There was alot more things to explore in Riven with the puzzles being an added bonus. In Exile, its all about the puzzles. I found this a little daunting. Overall, serious gameplayers will find this game a challenge but its not for weekend warriors."
3,Beautiful but Too Easy,"I am a huge fan of the world of the D'Ni. Read the books, played the games, blah blah blah. I had high hopes and expectations for Exile.The graphics were beautiful, even on my 400 mHz G3 PowerBook. The VR landscapes rotated smoothly and the video was good except for the well-documented audio sync problem. Good stuff.My only problem (and the reason for the low rating) is the fact that I finished the game in only a few days of not-very-intense playing. Riven took two or three times as long. Granted that some of the difference may be because navigation is easier in Exile than it was in Riven, so it didn't take as long to look around. But overall the puzzles seemed easier or just less complex.In any case, if you are a fan, the game is worth it just for the background - it fills in some holes in the overall story of Atrus. We finally know what his sons were up to."
1,ugh...how disappointing...,"I do have to say when i read the review of the person who posted before me, i was extremely skeptical, being how much i love britney . i didn't think anything about brit could be that bad and then i got this DVD and it really is terrible! you honestly could make a better home video. i guess this because it was an unauthorized attempt at a documentary. all they do is interview these 3 boring british people and have terrible, lame video footage. its obvious why britney spears would never produce a movie this crappy. better off buying another britney movie."
1,WORST DVD EVER,I LOVE BRITNEY so i went against the bad reviews!MAN WAS I WRONG it is sooooo bad!!its the worst dvd in history!
2,This DVD Is So Bad....!,"well i'm a huge fan of Britney, i was waiting like crazy for this DVD, when arrived i just opened it and play it on my DVD Player, then i was so disappointed... this DVD is just like ""Innocent Beauty"" (wich is a little expensive for the boring features) or ""Britney's Scrapbook"" (The Real name could be ""Britney's Crap Book"" LoL) ok, well this DVD is just interviews and horrible footage really the money DON'T WORTH IT, this is for REAL FANS and mostly COLLECTORS just another Britney Item for the Collection that's all, is not the big thing and really all the people on the DVD says the same damn things ""...she grow up in Kentwood...Disney...'Baby One More Time'..."" there is nothing new on it"
1,Not Good,This is obviously an unauthorised film. A couple of English people with a handycam with nothing new to say.
5,Britney Spears Is Great,SHE CAN SING AND DANCE. I HAVE SEEN HER SING AND SHE IS GREAT AT WHAT SHE DOES. SHE DOES SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO SHE PUTS HER HEART IN TO WHAT SHE DOES HER MUSIC IS GREAT TO DANCE TO MOST SINGERS PUT THERE HEART IN TO WHAT THEY DOMICKEY OURY AND KATHLEEN MITCHELL
3,Not too shine,"Straight all the time, the varnish coat so bad,not hard like the description, broken with a little tap over the bridge head."
1,This is not Audiovox brand.,The Amazon posting for Audiovox 8910 8610 8912 BATTERY BTR-8610 states that the product is by Audiovox. I received UTStarcom brand. I was expecting to receive Audiovox brand.Not sure how long the UTStarcom will last. I just received the battery yesterday. It works so far.
4,"Well done, but not quite classic",This is a pretty damn good ski movie; not the best I've ever seen but it has some really epic sequences and a solid soundtrack. TGR makes the best ski movies out there.
4,Idiots No More,"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Microsoft Works Suite 2000 is a great way for a beginner to stop feeling like an Idiot. Jargon is explained in the text as it comes up instead of hiding away back in a glossary like some computer books. Instructions are clear and step by step. The book is designed to be hands-on so that you can actually accomplish something on the computer as you go. There are tips and sidebar boxes that explain what to do and how to stay out of trouble. The chapter layout is set up so that someone could choose to go through the book step by step or just look up and do the thing they want to do at the moment. If you are really sensitive about the title, cover the book with a brown paper bag and use it anyway. This is an excellent reference for any beginner."
3,More Challenging than Lego Racers 2,"I bought this game (PC version) for my 5-year old son because he is absolutely hooked on Lego Racers 2. The combination of racing and shooting in that game plus the sheer number of tracks is addictive. Drome Racers is a bit more challenging and frustrating. First, it took me a week to figure out how to configure the game to use a joystick. Second, the cars in this game go much, much faster than in Lego Racers, and it's easy to lose control. Third, you have to go through many screens with many different options until you finally get to the race. Hopefully we'll get used to it with time."
2,miss stuffs,"first the color its all black dont red like the picture,and dont have the plug to connect or the AMP conector like the item say."
5,Civilization II Gold Multi Player Edition,I love the game but did not know there was more than 1 version of multiplayer games. I did not get what I thought I ordered. But the game itself is great.
3,OVERRATED,"This game is overrated by all means accept the psi powers.Graphics Could have been much better,Bosses are easy to beat,and over all the other bad is the weapons.You waste a whole clip on one enemy just to kill him,come on now.Im going to have to say the only thing good about this game is the psi powers.Then they gone have the nerve to put the making of psi ops in the special features like they did excelent with the game.My advice to you is save your money for the upcoming games like Halo2,Splinter cell3,The new rainbow six 3 and fable."
5,Goad finally speaks for a group without a voice.,"Jim Goad undertook the task of speaking for a group of people for whom there has been no voice. Redneck/white trash America has a blunt, funny, brilliant, and honest voice in Goad. His book looks at this country and it's history in a new, perhaps long overdue, light. His assertions and accusations may seem wild, but he has the facts to support them. Thanks and praise to Jim Goad."
1,Used to like J. Goad...,"...I actually used to like J. Goad in that hipster/ironic way back in the day. But you know what? When all is said and done, he's a jerk. He beat his wife for years. And beats his girlfriends. Complete jerk.So, he might be articulate enough to write a tome, but if he were not ""articulate"" he'd just be called what he is. A jerk. But the hipster legions who follow him are too dense to realize that this one of the most dangerous and sickest people ever to be given a voice in the media.When you read what he has to say, just keep in mind. None of it is irony. This dimwit believes it all."
1,This is a horrid book.,"I think that this book could make ANYONE dislike rednecks. The auther talks about how it is fine for white people to call black people the ""N"" word, but thinks that it is just evil for a black person to say ""Hick"". Sure, whites were slaves also, but who owned them? Whites. Whites owning whites is a hell of a lot different than a white owning a black. Whites were consittered to be HUMAN. Blacks were consittered to be 3/5 of a human. And on top of the the only reason that black slaves were consittered to be human at all was so Southern states would get more votes in the House. Please don't support this rotten book."
2,Bullcrap,"Goad doesn't sound like a tried and true redneck. I can tell that I was brought up in a hillbilly background, and it is nothing to admire. I'm proud of my country roots, but the culture of the redneck is a very damaging one. Sexual abuse, spousal abuse, alchoholism and drug use prevail. People gorge themselves on terrible food in a very unhealthy way. I'm glad to be out of where I was originally.This is by no means an American phenomenon, its more of a colonial nation one. You'll find rednecks in Canada, Australia, South Africa, etc. These groups are so cut off from their ancestral culture, they adopt a very depressing one.I agree that its becoming increasingly acceptable to be racist towards the white working class male in America, but I don't think Goad has any fresh ideas or thoughtful things to say."
1,He misses the point,"Sure, there is bigotry everywhere and poor whites are definitely subjected to ridicule. However, Goad misses the point. Place a poor white man in a suit and send him out into the masses during anytime in our history and he can easily assimilate into society. No preconceived notions. But place a black man in a suit at any time in our history and prejudices occur, then and now. Just ask all the black employees of Texaco who were referred to as ""jelly beans"" by the Board of Directors.Goad's book is nothing but a bunch of ""belly-aching"" by someone who can admit that his skin color offers him more advantages than disadvantages."
5,"A ""Working-Class"" Masterpiece","I am now reading this book for the third time. Mr. Goad manages to single-handedly repaint a portrait of American and European history based on obscure facts not found in either modern or antiquated history books.With relative ease he seems to smite the viewpoints of both white liberals and conservatives. But, unlike most of his contemporaries who would just leave it at that and gloat over his/her intellectual prowess, he offers ideas on how these ""race"" and ""class"" problems can be solved.I beleive ""EVERY WORKING-CLASS AMERICAN"" regardless of race, creed or color should read this book. As a result of reading this book I find myself knowing exactly who I should be angry with and why."
4,A Tough Read But Worth It,"Initially, I just thought this was a somewhat humorous tirade about the class system in America. But, right away, Goad describes the horrors of indentured servitude among the white underclass. While slaveowners mistreated their slaves, they knew that they had an investment in the people they owned. Indentured servants, because of the finite term they served, were used as hard as possible to get the most work out of them before their term was up. This caused a huge rate of fataility among such people. This is one of the number of tidbits of history you don't get in your ""normal"" history book.I think that the material covered is valuable for many an armchair historian and fear that the tone of the book and Goad's free hand with profanity and ethnic slurs (which I suspect are intended to amuse and make a point of ""we're all in this together down in the underclass"") will deter the more sensitive reader from taking in the information in this book."
4,original and provocative,"this is a terrific book. excellent writing--profane, vivid, polemical--and the reasoning is solid. intend to use it as one text in an undergraduate class on the history and theory of freedom of expression to help students think about the folly of hate speech regulations."
5,God damn!,"God damn, I said! This book throws open the closet door to expose class problems -- which have been most of The Problem all along. The Redneck Manifesto was more educational than all four years of college (of course, it was a college in the South -- gotcha! redneck prejudice at work!). The author gets a little self-involved a few times, but it doesn't take away from his painfully honest & accurate depiction of working-class whites. This sucker should be required reading for high schoolers."
5,Read at your own Risk...,"Finally a book on American history and sociology for which you don't need a box of NoDoz! Goad's writing, ranging from colorful to flat out vulgar, is nonetheless very insightful and informative. I would NOT recommend this book to the closed-minded, politially correct, or easily offended. For the rest of us, however, Goad will surely give you a reason to laugh out loud! Goad's rant on racism and the history of social order is hightly descriptive as he depicts a nation of ""white trash"" whose leisurely activity ""manifests a need to FEEL something apart from a working life in which you're treated with all the warmth of a Plasticine toy robot."" I was blown away by the historical stories and statistics of white slavery, submission, and opression. Goad reminds us that ""White niggers have feelings too!"" Ultimately, this book will truly prompt you to rethink your roots, whether they are white, black, hispanic, green, or purlple!"
4,another form of racisim?,"As a black male who went to college, made friends, lived and worked in north eastern and central Pennsylvania for the last 14 years I had to get this book. I have serveral good friends who some may call ""rednecks"" or ""hicks"" or whatever, but I never considered it a form of bigotry.The author did a great job explaining the origins of poor whites and how little they've changed. I liked how he showed that NON WEALTHY whites and blacks are more similar they some may think. He also hit home on the issue of ECONOMICS has the driving force that keeps NON WEALTHY blacks and whites at each others throats.The only thing that kept this from being a perfect rating was the fact that the last chapter seemed to run on a little too much, but that's all.If your the type that's interested in interracial relations, I would recommend this book. I don't think you'll see things the same again after reading it."
4,I saw my family in his book,"Not long ago, I realized that although I live in a Northeastern metropolis, my late grandmother would be considered white trash because A. she was poor, B. she was Southern, and C. she was a hairdresser. Goad's book told me what I already knew; that she was a good woman. I am disgusted that my relatives are constantly demeaned because of their geographic origins. I'm also sick of country-club buppies who whine about racism, and in the same breath make a snide comment about poor whites. I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because of Goad's excessively graphic language, which although initially appropriate, eventially became a detriment to the book. But ""Redneck Manifesto"" is an important book and deserves to be widely read."
5,More Christian than most churches...,"If you have ever wanted to actually get to the core of Christianity as Jesus taught it, this book is for you. If you have begun to see that what the church teaches is about domination and control of the masses, and you have a notion that maybe instead of praying to an idol, you might want to follow in the steps of Christ instead (as he suggested), read this book. It's also a beautiful way to start your day and highly recommended for morning meditations."
5,Early Christian Classic,There are three books every Christian should have:1. A Bible2. A Cathechism3. The Imitation of ChristEnough said.
5,How wonderful!,"Over 600 years old, this book makes a serious impact on Christian thought and life. My dear friends gave me this after my conversion and it was timely and touching. Read and think deeply about these simple writings."
1,Imitation of Christ,I have had this prayer book for years and have purchased several in the past for friends. Again I ordered it for a friend and it has been changed. How can prayers be changed? It didn't even have the Imprimatur in it which states it is sanction by the Catholic Church as all the others did. I'm very disappointed with this new version.
2,Imitation of Christ,"The title of the book was somewhat misleading to me. I didn't realize it was written by a monk which is an entirely different way of life than a woman living in today's world. It was a difficult read and, quite candidly, I couldn't finish it. I gave the book away."
5,A Strong Walk with God,Have you ever desired more God in your life? The Imitation of Christ provides readers a strong example of a pure and holy Christian walk. Touching on many specific subjects you can feel the connectedness Thomas a Kempis felt with Jesus and his deeper understanding of spiritual truths. This book is great for daily meditations and a inspirational example of a man walking closely with Christ and in harmony with those around him.
3,Soft Peddled,"While the binding and all aspects of appearance of the Hedrickson Christian Classics are stunning, the content was soft peddled compared to the original.Obviously designed for collectors, it looks great on bookselves. Hedrickson should have concetrated on cover design and quality binding and left the translation to the original translators."
2,Letdown,"This is a step down from Hasbro's earlier version of Risk, which featured 5 different maps to play on, beautiful graphics and a better interface. This one has only the classic Risk board, which gets dull in a hurry. The battle interfaces are awkward and ugly and the computer opponents consistently inept. Save your money, or look for the previous version."
2,not much fun,"Although this game has different playability than Risk 1 and good graphics, it is the cheatenist game I've ever played, it is nigh impossible to win these games, except only occasionally, and by then you are too worn out from trying to win to enjoy it.I would not bother with it, stick with Risk 1, the original.I'm an old risk player from way back, I used to play the board game with my brother in law many years ago, and I have the pc version of original Risk,and even though that game cheats as do all computer games, it's not near half as bad as risk 2."
3,"Fun Game, easy to learn, lifetime to master.","This is a very faithful recreation of the boardgame experience. In fact, I wished they have gone for even more of a classic feel, because the CG battles were more of a distraction, and doesn't feel right when you are mainly playing on a game board. The only disappointment was that I thought this would include the original European map, but it didn't. Really, I mean, does it kill them to have that thrown in with the game? Overall, I had a great fun with it, and it's so addictive that I've afraid to boot it up:)"
4,"Fun, nice challeges.","Fun game, better graphics than I had anticipated. Nice challenging AI at times."
2,Remake of the original,"This version of Risk I thought was an overall bad idea because it just played of the original. furthermore, the original RISK 1 disk was more than good enough in every department. The company who released this video game was just trying to ""update"" the game in which didn't needed to be updated. bad job over all"
4,"Excellent book, but B&W pictures","Excellent book with a lot of good information, but the black and white pictures aren't of great quality. However, this one stays on the reference shelf!"
4,In Sheep's Clothing,"I found this to be a wonderful reference. I have many books on knitting and some on spinning, but this was something very different and a great resource. In this book I learned a lot about the differences in the fiber, making me think more carefully about what I wanted to do with the wool and whether or not it would meet my needs. I have found myself coming back to it time and again looking up various pieces of information. A ""must have"" resource for the spinner and fiber enthusiast."
4,A wonderful reference book,"This is a wonderful reference book for handspinners. It covers many sheep breeds, giving descriptions of the fleece (staple length, quality rating, typical uses, and even a photo of a lock for about 90% of the breeds). As a beginning handspinner, I found this to be indispensible information, since most of the stuff I've managed to find about sheep breeds has been directed at livestock types. I appreciated the technique sections, since they scratched the surface of matching your spinning style to the fleece. If you are trying to get a good idea of how to consciously select appropriate wool and technique for your projects, this is the place to start. The only thing I would change would be to have color photos, and more of them - particularly in the colored fleece section."
4,TOO MUCH PLASTIC,"For those of us who can't help themselves and have to have all our plastic with us, this is the wallet. However there are a number of difficulties:1. The plastic insert does not work well. Needs something to anchor it to wallet.2. You need to keep it in a front pocket. Does not fit in back and to rely on a pocket in a jacket is not practical.3. It can be a little difficult to get cards out.Otherwise it does the job. I have my Visa Card, Amex cards, mastercard, discover card. Medicare Card, Supplement Card, Hospital Blue Card. Then I have Macy's , Kohls and Best Buy. Have to have my rewards cards with me. Of course my license, AAA Card and a couple of gas cards. Could I go out without a number of grandchildren's pictures. And finally the Frequent Flyer Cards, Htel Cards and Rental Car Cards. You decide what you can leave behind. I am a slave to plastic.........."
5,long credit card wallet,its what i needed for all my cards ! you cant go wrong with this product . and the price was perfect .
4,Hello.,"This is similar to what I was looking for. It works great for the number of cards I have, but I was hoping to find one that has a driver license insert on the outside! I will use it till falls apart."
4,Good wallet with lots of room for all your cards,The only bad thing I would say is that my Wife and children thought it was a womans wallet and it is a little too big for my back pocket. Good quality leather though.
3,A Bit Snug,"I've been looking for a leather credit card wallet for some time and was so excited to get this. However, the spaces for the cards are quite a bit snug for the card. It seems they are just shy of the size needed for a credit card."
2,You get what you pay for,Cheaply made leather wallet. With only a few weeks of use the stiching is coming loose and some of the cards hang on leather flaps. You get what you pay for I guess.
4,my nephew loves it,"yeah its an awesome toy...hes 5 so its difficult for him to transform it but he has fun, some pieces are really easy to lose"
1,Avoid At All Costs,"""The Mad"" has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The editing was so bad that I truly expected to hear the director yelling directions before the actors began moving. The premise was idiotic, the acting was not even passable for a high school improvisational team and the complete lack of caring that seemed to go into the entire production even further diminished any potential there may have been. Do not even rent this!"
1,Worst movie,"Hi..Im amazed at those people who gave this more than one star, this one was just terrible, a very bad movie..I gave this a try mainly because of Billy Zane, and because i like Zombie movies, but this movie was a real let down and it kept me wondering why would Zane agree to act in a movie like this.The plot was stupid, about Mad cow disease truning people into zombies, and as one reviewer before mentioned that one of the silliest things is when the actual beef patties and the uncoocked beef starts attacking humans, that was really stupid.The script was also bad, it was meant to be funny, but it felt more silly than funny, and characters in the movie acted in a very unrealistic way,I know this movie was meant to be funny and a parody of zombie movies, but it failed at that and ended up being a Mad, i mean a Bad movie..just save your money for something better.."
3,Not bad...,"Not a bad movie. Not the best by any means, but it is a good addition to any zombie fanatics collection."
4,Pretty good!!!,"Billy Zane played one of those dads who trys to be cool and hip around their kids so they can stay close as the kids get older. But he didnt expect to encounter zombies, this movie was cool, a lot of directors should go this route when making a zombie movie. When in doubt, make a ""ZOMEDY"" the drawn out dialogue was pretty funny. Only down side for me, was that when the movie ended I kinda wanted more."
2,Badddd!!!,The Mad is a bad film. No question about it. I had heard it was bad because it included man eating hamburger patties. That isn't the half of it. It isn't the half of it either that Billy Zane plays the part as if he is sneering at the production. The acting by adults is even OK; and I would label the idea of zombies produced by a mad cow-like disease as pretty good. What makes the movie truly bad is a stream of consciousness script that often disconnects totally from the plot. I remember one scene in particular where Billy Zane and his daughter alternated between talking about their relationship and fighting zombies. There are a number of scenes like that. So see The Mad but be forwarned.
2,Stop the MADness,Okay so it wasn't that bad but it wasn't that good(sigh)..the best horror movie Billy Zane was in was Demon Knight..the first Tales From The Crypt movie.
4,better then most b horror flicks,"at least americans know how to make a mad cow disease movie, unlike dead meat this movie is fun to watch, not a bunch of zombies but the actors pull this movie off and make it decent, i enjoyed it anyway......."
3,It's a zomedy.,"This movie was not a serious all out zombie movie BUT it WASN'T homemade quality, it wasn't full of bad acting, and it was pretty funny. It had that cute black humor and some gore mixed in with good cinematography. I liked it. Is it worth the 13.00 price tag, NO! But if you can find it cheap I think it's worth a watch."
2,Save Your Money,"I purchased this book and now regret it. So many of the ballets decribed are minor pieces that are rarely performed any more, while many major classic ballets that are still performed and/or that are important in dance history are totally neglected (e.g. Le Corsaire, Raymonda, Paquita, Esmerelda). Other descriptions focus only on one part of the ballet rather than telling you the actual story. The entry on ""La Bayadère,"" for instance, focuses almost entirely on Act IV, which is frustrating since this is a ballet with a complicated libretto that could really benefit from a complete summary. I'd recommend going to a library and photocopying the info on the ballets that interest you rather than purchasing this as a handy reference book to have at home. It's just not worth the money."
5,What would happen to your pet if something happened to you?,"People never want to discuss this topic when it pertains to one another, let alone an animal companion. As sad as this is, it isin reality, something we need to take care of before it is too late. Ophelia's Winter isn't just the story of a cat, but the terrible experiences of a beloved companion animal after the death of her owner. All of these things could have prevented. Although many parts of the story will make you cry, it seems to be what is needed in order to draw attention to some very important facts. If you love your pets, you have to have a plan in place in the event something unexpectedly ever happens to you."
4,a complex sedate mystery,"In the second adventure of Senior Citizen PI Oxnard, his first was ORTEGA NIGHT, Phil & Paula are staying at a ski lodge just as hunting season opens in California's High Sierra. They're there to check on a relative's investment when they are drawn into a missing person search. Then an award-winning painting is vandalized & before anyone has a clue, the artist is bludgeoned into a coma.Now the mountain communities don't look quite so idyllic, & as Phil & Paula talk to the locals, sifting through the clues, they themselves edge closer to danger.Rebeccasreads recommends MCCOLLUM'S RUN as an entertaining evening's read."
2,Not worth $60.00,"This item is truly not worth $60.00 that I paid for it. There are two buttons and there is a mild roar that comes out of both. I was certain this dino would do something worth $60.00. I bought it b/c my son wanted it for Easter. He decided a few days before, so I had very little time to find it. I found it here, and although the seller was wonderful to work with. The item is extremely overpriced."
2,Light as a feather (2.5 stars),"Set primarily in Dublin, Ireland, Past Secrets tells the story of three women who all live on Summer Street, and who all have secrets they are hiding from their families.There's Christie, the kind and devoted wife, mother and grandmother; 30 year old Maggie, who moves back home with her parents after a relationship crisis; and Faye, whose teenage daughter runs away to America with a wanna-be rock star.Past Secrets is typical chicklit, ideal for a lazy beach read with minimal concentration required. It doesn't challenge you, change your thinking, or even stay with you long after you've read it. And it doesn't seek to. With no pretensions, Past Secrets is a simple, easy and pleasant enough read. If you're looking for more, look elsewhere."
4,So Close to 5 Stars!,"I've followed Rosanne Cash since ""Seven Year Ache"" and this collection does a good job of covering her time at Columbia Records. What's missing? ""Hold On"" from ""Rhythm and Romance"", more songs from ""The Wheel"" and her contribution to the Yoko Ono tribute album ""Nobody Sees Me Like You Do"". This is the best hits compilation out there and if you don't have any of the others, definitely pick this one up.NOTE TO SONY/BMG: Now that you've done ""Essentials"" with most of your artists, how about giving Rosanne a double disc treatment? And now that the two of you are one company, how about releasing Rosanne's German Ariola release from the late 70s?"
1,Not comparable,"These cartridges are the perfect example of how expensive saving money can be. The cartridges produce printouts of inconsistent quality at best, and most of the time, the output was unusable. Stick with the name brand."
3,It is not this simple!,"A plea to my American counterparts - please do not take the image this book presents as an accurate view of the UK.The same 'decent' generation Hitchens talks about, churchgoers, Conservative voters, moral guardians, etc, contain the same people who have harboured wife beaters, child abusers and racist oppressors who have had a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. They hate to be questioned or challenged, because they have no real answers, and have no real justification for being in the position they are.They are no great leaders of commerce, but use their positions to safeguard their vested interests which, when analysed, cause their strategies to fall like a house of cards.Hitchens is a joke amongst many UK journalists. It would be easy to be intoxicated by the romantic sentiments of his book. Think for yourself and do not fall for it!"
1,A bigot in traditional clothing,"A truly awful book lamenting a time when old, white men ruled through a system of patronage, nepotism and oppression. Don't mistake this ridiculous tome as history. Equating an increase in murder rates with the abolition of the death penalty is as ignorant as Hitchens' laughable denigration of a public school system that has given opportunities to millions of people who Hitchens would rather have seen consigned to the low wage labor scrap heap of his youth. Britain is a vibrant European culture, not a bunch of cigar-smoking bigots with stiff upper lips. As a British person living in the US, this is the kind of book that makes me want to practice my American accent. I, like most British people, am nothing like Hitchens and hate to think that I might be perceived that way. Don't waste your time. Read something else."
4,Alias took me by Surprise.,Alias was awsome! The environments and character designs were great. The combonation of stealth and action was a relief of having just stealth or action. This game is worth getting! Anyone who knows what Alias is or has heard about it will love it. The cast of the show lends their voices to this game and is pretty itchen!!!
4,Review Based On Demo,"Even though I may not have been at the store long enough to play much of the demo, I still enjoyed it.... You start off in a museum, unarmed. Even though you are unarmed you can still punch, kick, and do some pretty cool combos... and once you knock out a guard you can pick up their weapon by simply pushing B.Graphics: 8/10Not the best I've seen... but still pretty good...Gameplay: 9/10Very fun and easy controls to get used to... Y to crouch, B to pick up weapons, etc. The only problem is she walks way too slow when going up stairs...Sound: ??/10I don't really know because I really couldn't hear it.Overall: 8.5/10I might have to go out and buy this game... I really enjoyed the demo.... even though I was only in the store for like 5 minutes... my brother didn't find what he was looking for so we had to leave... Too bad... I wanted to play some more.."
4,Changed my life...,"Wow. And I thought immersing myself in the world of SD-6, Credit Dauphine and the CIA was a weekly TV adventure. The ALIAS game lets you LIVE the adventure. Whether you're Sydney on a pulse-pounding, techno-supported mission... or you're Sydney discovering a new piece of the puzzle, the ALIAS game never stops the action. That collection of pixels IS Jennifer Garner, and you won't be the same once you pretend to be her in a 3D universe. Get the game, pop it in your Xbox and prepare to turn down social invitations... it will be your life!"
4,fun...a little lacking,"If you are a fan of Alias you will love this game. It is a lot of fun, and plays as if you are in the show. Graphics are fantastic. With the exception of two characters, they all look like their tv counterpart.A few problems:When the characters talk it looks a bit strange. Would have looked better if the lips stayed still.The controls/movement are a bit awkward. Especially when fighting, and the controls don't seem logical at times.Still a lot of fun to play. I am on the second mission. Not to hard and not too easy so far."
5,Perfect!,"I have three granddaughters who love to see their art work in my ""gallery,"" a wall in my hallway dedicated solely for hanging their art. I needed a clean way to hang the sheets of paper without putting holes in the wall. This has turned out to be the perfect product. When a piece needs to come down, the putty peels off the wall and off the paper with no trouble. Highly recommended."
5,Very tacky tac! Perfect!,"I had been reading reviews for all the differents brands of adhesive putty because i was looking to put glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of my room and i wanted something that would stick for a long time. I also wanted a white putty because i had started to use the blue stuff and the blue stuff would show through the star when it was put up and it just looked bad. That's when i found the UHU tac and it's been everything I've wanted it to be! I've had the stars up now for a couple months and not a one has fallen down yet! Also, my room is very large and the amount of putty that i received was WAYYY enough to cover the entire room. I'll be sticking with UHU if i ever need to put up my glow-in-the-dark stars. :)"
3,"Decent, but not great.","I purchased this for my son to put posters up in his room.They work decently. I think I expected too much out of them however. They hold up the posters, but if you bump against the item being held up, it falls down. Not sure if we got a bad batch or not.And they melt easily. I had it on the counter next to the stove (about a foot away from the stove). I was going to use it to put up a cooking guideline on one of my cupboards. The bottom three rows melted together from just boiling water on the stove.I think next time I'll go with a major name brand, such as 3M, have had good results with that brand in the past."
2,Did not work,"I purchased this product and although it arrived in a timely fashion, it failed to impress. After following the instructions the putty still failed to stick a simple light weight poster to my wall. Very disappoint."
1,The worst,This is the worst adhesive putty I have ever tried. Normally purchase the blue brand. This would not keep paper adhered to a painted or wood surface.
2,"Oh...please,not again","Most of the show was rehashed bits we've see on TV or other crappy videos making money off the Beatles.The most anoying thing for me was this constant soundtrack(instrumental Beatle type sound)It made it difficult to hear interviews and commentaries from people we don't know and don't care to know. The worst part is they left you hanging at the ""Give My Regards To Broadstreet"" premere. I guess his caree ended there..."
2,Not What I Expected,"It goes on thick, so even when you try and add a thin coat it bubbles up and dries with a smudge. I tried it with three different polishes and got the same result. I love Essie, so I am disappointed in this."
2,These shoes are low-class,"Do not get these shoes. The material feels cheap, like a fake. The lacing is hardly inventive, as the tounge doesn't stretch enough so putting them on is very uncomfortable. 2 stars for the soles, which are good and durable."
4,secret sisters 3,"MacGowan Meets His Match is the third of the Secret Sisters series by Annette Broadrick. Orphan Jenna Craddock travels from Australia to the UK to find her family, only to be told by her evil aunt that she was adopted. But something her aunt says before she slams the door has Jenna travelling to Edinburgh in search of a man named Dumas, who is apparently looking for her. While she searches, she takes on a job, transcribing tapes of a spy novel for Sir Ian MacGowan, in Stirling. This conclusion to the Secret Sisters wraps the story up nicely with the reappearance of Fiona and Greg, Kelly and Nick, and reunions all round. Ian and Jenna are a feisty pair and it's a fun romance. I was just a little disappointed this one wasn't set in Australia."
5,McGOWEN MEETS HIS MATCH,LOVED THIS BOOK THE 3RD AND THE OTHERS IN A 3 BOOK SERIES BY ANNETTE BROADRICK. THE OTHER 2 ARE 'MAN IN THE MIST' AND 'TOO TOUGH TO TAME'.
3,"This is good for anyone new to adventure riding, but it borders on being a touratech infomercial.","This is a good source for learning about all of the farkles available for the BMW GS, that's about it."
2,Too dry,"Applying daily, I noticed after about a week a significant increase and deepening in the wrinkles under my eyes. I discontinued use and within a few days my skin returned to normal. It may work well as a sunscreen, but it is not the product for me."
2,is it a white shadow what you're looking for?,"then buy on. This is a good moisturizer; however it just adds a white tone to the under eye area. Personally, I prefer an eye cream that does not change my natural skin color. I basically would have to apply a light tone of make up to match the rest of my face.White residues is always an issue with some sunblock creams and this is not the exception."
2,"Sadly, speak up","A major part of ""live"" cd's is, for me, the remarks of the artist, both planned and spontaneous. Whoever did the sound and the mix really doesn't seem to understand this. I say pass on this one and get the previous Dylan tribute. That's 5 star stuff."
4,Works as designed,"Works as designed. Has nice fit and finish with the Corolla. Problem is that the radio sleeve tabs are typically a half a centimeter short from the ridge in the pocket installation kit, and hence the radio jiggles a lot when the car goes over a bump."
2,Ehhh,It doesnt fit with alphine radio in Corolla 05 :( Im disspointed!! You should do some resarch before buying this.
3,Not all that great,This item has a openting at the top of the kit instead of the bottom not sure why. Maybe because of the dash design. I guess it is built ok but not my style.
4,Desktop Reference rack,This rack is just what I wanted. I won't be able to say how durable it is until some time passes. It appears to be well constructed though!
2,Somewhat disappointed,"Somewhat disappointed. Item will not tighten completely where the stand meets the display unit. Therefore, it won't stay completely upright."
3,Fellowes Desktop Reference Rack,Rack is ok but it doesn't hold together well at back slot. It also doesn't adjust up and down very easily. Though all of this could be due to user error :) I love the idea of the reference rack though; easy access to info and decreases wall clutter. Thanks!
2,Not happy :(,"Unstable, wobbly. No matter how many different ways I try to adjust it, it won't sit up on my desk correctly."
3,Like the item overall,"I liked this item, especially that the arm moves around and it's flexible. It just needs a little more weight in the bottom if you are going to pull the pages and arm all the way forward, and low. It tips a little if you do this. I still think it's a great value for the price overall."
3,Very handy,I purchased this about 6 months ago. I wanted to be able to access schedules and charts easily and keep them organized. The base is not heavy enough and would move every time I turned the page. I decided to take the base off of the organizer and mount it to the wall and it works much better.
3,It's okay,Product is what I expected it to be. The taste to me is that not bad compared to the smell. I gag every time I open the container. Time will tell if I get over the smell!
2,No Color Photos,"I bought this book along with the Falcon Guide book and was very disappointed with both books. This one offers good descriptions of the hikes and what to expect, but no color photos. A nice general overview of the hike, length, elevation change, difficulty, and some color photos of the highlights were all I wanted, and neither book fit this description. You would only need one or the other, and really either would suffice, but if you want color photos pass on both."
1,Complete??,Only the first twenty pages mention ANYTHING about recreation or facilities. The rest is simply a hiking guide. No color pictures.
1,The Past is Ruined,"I cant say I'm to happy with Hitz Pro. I dont understand why people have to change the game so much, leave it the way it is and just patch up a couple of glitches. Making the game 5 on 5 completely ruined it. Who the hell makes this game anyway Gary Bettman lol. This game went from being an awesome unique three on three battle with thundering hitz and amazing graphics to an ordinary 5 on 5 hockey game which I can I play on any other hockey game. Go back to the old style.Thanks, Anonymous"
3,Go Back To 3-on-3 Hockey,NHL Hitz is known for 3-on-3 hockey. Thats what I liked so much about Hitz 2003. The gameplay is pretty good and the graphics are good but who needs penalties not to mention the hits aren't as big. I did like the fighting a little bit but there was no chance for blocks. If you want a real hockey game buy ESPN NHL hockey.
1,Wow! This is a really poorly written book.,I am very surprised Exam Cram published such a bad book. I have used Exam Cram before and have found their books very usefull. This one was the exact opposite. The material and diagrams presented are barely ledgible. I agree with the previous reader about not being able to finish it. It is clearly a waste of money.
1,BAD CHOICE!,"Don't buy this book! It doesn't relate in any way with the exam, it's very bad written and full of useless information. I couldn't read more than 100 pages."
1,Don't waste your money,"I totally agree with the reader from philadelphia, pa. I don't even consider this book is an average book for the exam."
3,"Great Reference, Inadequate depth","I have used other Exam Cram books to pass VB and VC++ exams, but I don't think I could do it with this one. However, it is a great REFERENCE for syntax, etc."
1,Worthless for SQL and PL/SQL Exam,I passed OCP SQL and PL/SQL Exam today. BUT I found this book useless. Don't waste your money!
1,Only good use of the book is the practice test at the end,Bought this book for additional preparation for the SQL and PL/SQL exam after reading the first 5 chapters of OCP:Application Developer (this book covers material for all the exams required for OCP-Application Developer). The only practical use I was able to get from the exam cram book was the practice exam at the end. scored an 83. This book is a waste of maney.
4,Add collage watercolor for intersting & beautiful results,"This book delves into the fascinating technique of adding collage elements to watercolor paintings. Basically, this is adding bits of paper of various shapes, textures & colors to the surface to enhance the painting over them.Experimentation to develop a personal style is stressed here. Basic principles of texture, layering, contrast and color are explored first. Then you see how these elements are incorporated into finished paintings.The author is an accomplished master of this technique. Many examples of his work are shown in progress & completed. He emphasizes throughout how artists of any level in any medium can apply these concepts to their work.Whether or not you decide to emulate Brommer's work, this book is a great springboard of ideas and ways of looking at the painting process. It is filled with solid and helpful ideas."
1,Old Out Dated Book,"The book is very old (publish in 1986) so do not think ""new"" means a current edition. The book has the feel of an old tired 143 page jr. college text. Even in art books can be outdate, because the materials suggested are meant for ""1986"" reader! A ""new"" edition that I bought was faded cover and had original price mark out. This was a big disappointment! Save your money buy something current!"
4,Southern Blues,"The Decoys have that southern blues sound to them, they even have a Allmans Brother cover here, if you like the Fabulous Thunderbirds, SRV, Allman Brothers you would like this CD.I downloaded a copy from E-music and it is definetly played alot."
5,Great R & B..,"Just love the title track..the drum fills are fabulous, a groove from here to Canada..Great players, Kelvin Holly plays his buns off on this record...David Hood, Scott Boyer and NC Thurman...great job guys..The recording is great as well.Love this record.."
1,I never purchased this item,"I never purchase this item I hope I am not being charged for it. I have a Kindle Fire, but never bought The Decoys I looked at it."
3,FROM DAWN TILL DUSK,"Funny and action packed movie about two outlaws that take a family hostage trying to escape to Mexico which is successful but turns bad when they walk into a bar full of bloodsucking babes. Very gory and might scare little kids (under 6). Rated R: for violence, language and nudity"
4,"Tarantino style, but no Tarantino substance","Quentin Taratino's 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jackie Brown, and 'Reservoir Dogs' screenplays were outstanding. But, 'From Dusk till Dawn' is borderline o.k. Robert Rodriguez destroys the film with his pathetic directing so I bought the screenplay to see Tarantino's script, hoping it would be better, but was terribly dissapointed. The script is certainly not Tarantino's best and the plot is really bad when it gets to the monster part. It is a shame Tarantino wasted his brilliant writing on some two-bit monster flick. (there were some cool conections with his other movies though.)"
4,DECENT GAME,LIKE I SAID NBA BALLERS IUS A DECENT GAME FOR WHAT ITS WORTH GLORIFIED BBALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HORRIBLE LOAD TIMES I MEAN JUST DOWN RIGHT TERRIBLY LONG YOU ALMOST THINK THE GAME FREZZES UP AT TIMES THERE SO LONG OTHER THEN THAT IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE LOAD TIMES ANY SPORTS FAN SHOULD ENJOY THIS GAME.
1,The game is pointless,"First of all the game is very unrealistic and stupid. If you like games that are impossible to beat and last forever, then this is the game for you. You get to a point in the game where you are playing Jason Williams on a yaht. To win you must score atleast 11 points and win by two but you must also win by bringing down the house. As I soon found out, bringing down the house doesn't really exist in this game. I ended up scoring 144 points and finally turned the game off once I had realized that I had wasted over 2 hours playing a game that was rigged. This game deserves to dye and if anyone is planning on buying it rent it and play until you reach Jason Williams, then decide whether its worth the 40 bucks or not. Good luck with whatever you decide. Payce!"
4,NBA Ballers,"This game is the best. I am 14 years of age goin on to 15, and i would reconmend this game for anybody my age or any one else younger than 16.If you like the street baller personalitly, what i mean by this if you like games were you can buy your own house , buy your own car, and gain repution as a stret baller this is the game is for you, not to mention that it is rated E- For Every Body."
4,the shibby,"The game is sick!!!!!!!!! IF you like long games (not THAT long) and fun ones, ull love this is the bomb"
4,Another average Xbox video game,"Well, NBA Ballers is a nice game. You play one on one with difficult opponents. It is pretty much Street basketball. There are many crazy moves you may accomplish, well, you have to unlock them first. You can give yourself an alley-oop, and you can even pass the ball to one of your friends who are watching from the stands. NBA ballers is a satisfactory XBOX game and I would recommend to purchase this fun and entertaining product."
2,Whare you at Ballas?,"The Ballers are here! So are the graphics, but whare is the fun? You chose an NBA player and a crib to play and it's on! You have to win if you wanna play at exotic cribs like Shaq's in Hollywood, Kobe's in Italy, or Yao's in Beijing. There is a segmant of the game called ""Rags to Riches"" in which you are a poor Street Baller staring in a reallity T.V. show that puts you up against other street players and NBA players to win cash. This is a cool idea and it is preety fun, I would not buy the game. It dose'nt compare to NBA street or NBA Live."
2,Blocked shots,"Everybody claims to have the best basketball product. However, as a real N.Y.er,I have yet to see anyone (NBA Street,Street Hoops,NBA Live)produce a feature that includes ""GettingStuck to the Backboard"". Although the NBA referees call this goaltending, this a myth. Goaltending is when the ball is on the downward flight! Getting stuck, back in the 70s' was one of the most embarrasing things that could happen to an opponent aside from getting dunked on. Everybody can dunk today. How about putting some real funk into the game and include this special feature that no distributors have to date. I can guarantee you that if you include this feature, the word will spread all over the internet about it for the video game junkies! Well, I have other beneficial suggestions but I'm not even getting paid for this one! Think about it(..)!"
1,doesnt ship in 2- 3 days,I dont know how this game is because I havent gotten it yet. I ordered it almost a week ago and amazon still has not shipped it. This is just to let people know if they order this it won't ship in two or three days. I think amazon needs to remove this from the details and give me free next day shipping because i have been waiting so long.
5,Really nice sound,"I heard Bubblehead on the radio, and I thought it sounded really cool, so I figured I'd get the album. Sure enough, it's a real pleaser! My favorite track has to be #11 King of Speed. My first thought about this album was that these guys sound like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But, Uncle Ho rocks SO much more! Red Hot Chili Peppers sound like pansies compared to Uncle Ho, who's a bit louder. So if you dig that kind of stuff, I DEFINATELY reccommend this album. You won't be let down! I promise!"
5,This cd rocks,"You should get this cd. Bubblehead is a great song. I love listening to it, when you hear it you will be hooked."
1,Defective - sent it back immediately,"I'm glad I ordered this from Amazon because they make it quick and easy to get a refund. The cartridge spilled yellow toner powder on everything. When I inserted it (correctly!) into my printer, the whole thing made a grinding noise I have NEVER before heard. I've had this printer for five years and have never had any problems with it.The Jetfill cartridge was a piece of junk. I sent it back and ordered from another company."
4,"Great design, but the finish is a little wierd","I like this lighter a lot but the image appears to be some sort of film that is transferred and permanently bonded to the lighter surface. It makes the entire front of the lighter look shiny/glossy while the rest of the lighter is a little more flat/matte (something that I didn't expect from the online images). Nonetheless, I like guns, cowboys and skulls so it was a great addition to my collection."
4,Great lighter a bit misleading.,This lighter is awesome with it's matte black finish and functions just the way a zippo should even came with a cool box to store it in.The only complaint I have is that in the picture the cowboy design looks painted on but I was a little disappointed to see that it was just a sticker.
5,"Cool, cool, cool!!!","It is one of the best games we own. If you like action, you cannot stop playing. Great!!!"
3,"Comme ci, comme ca","Pat Thomi's Cd ""Remote Control"" wasn't bad, but I wouldn't pay (...) for it (I got to listen to it for free, since I'm involved with a radio station). At 52:25 worth of music, it's not the world's longest CD by modern (80-minute) standards.It's hard to describe music these days, but I'd describe ""Remote Control"" as sort of ""New Age jazz with some rock elements"". Thomi composed all the songs but one, plays most of the instruments, and does the ""programming"".The best tracks, in my highly subjective opinion, are ""Love's Own Time"", ""L.B."", ""Lady M."", and ""Aria"". I could have done without ""The Bitch"". Your mileage will undoubtedly vary."
4,Good Quality,"The graphics were very good quality and very close to how the game would be on a console. game play is slightly different then what you would be use to, but not hard to figure."
3,good not great,"it was fun, but i found it extremely hard, or maybe i just suck at fighting games but it could be cool when it wanted to be."
1,HATE IT,"I GOT THIS PHONE I WAS REALLY EXCITED. AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS I HATE IT . I GOT IT ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO,I ABSOLUTLY HATE IT. IT IS DIFFICULT AND AGGRAVATING. THE CAMERA IS SO-SO. THE BATTERY LIFE SUCKS AND YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE SIDE BUTTON FOR EVERYTHING , WHICH IS DIFFICULT WHILE DRIVING.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY"
1,Don't buy this,"worst phone i have ever used.Still using CDMA technology.Battrey gets discharged pretty quickly.Takes lot of time,practise and patience to get used to the touch pad."
2,Too sensitive & not robust,"I am not satisfied with this phone. Like the person below, I had to create a fake number (called AAVoicemail) as just about every time I pressed the contacts button, the phone called the first person on my contact list.If you buy this phone, do not drop it even once as it does not take a beating. I dropped it once and now the call button rarely works.I never hooked up the music. When I tried, I found that the earphone/AC plug was bent. I took the phone to a service center and they said I would have to pay a $50 restocking fee to exchange it. I fixed it myself. Now it works, but I have to be careful when plugging in the earphone/AC extension.I don't use an earphone or bluetooth. I rarely use the camera. The phone is good if you want to be trendy, but it was not built to last."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"This phone is such a piece of junk, I would give it a 1/4th of a star if I could. Its screen messes up if you play to many games or touch it too often. I'll press the 9 button and the 3 button will be pressed and the done button won't work on texting. I can't press any of the icons on the lower half of the screen. It is frustrating and annoying and Verizon is not helpful unless you want to pay over $100 for a replacement phone (if your warranty is up) until your upgrade. If you leave the phone alone for about 4 hours, then the screen works for, oh, 2 min than malfunctions again, recalibrating it does NOT work. The only good thing about it is it has great battery life but totally not worth the frustration it will cause. (had two of these, one was sent from Verizon when I still had the warranty on my phone, it sucked just as bad as the first one). Don't buy it, avoid it like the plague."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"I bought this phone and for the first few days loved it...however, after about a week its flaws began to irritate me, and I ended of trying to force myself to like it. The touch pad is very frustrating (either refuses to register touch or registers multiple touches at once). Text messaging is terrible because messages are often sent halfway through writing them due to the touch screen. The camera is extremly hard to work especially when aiming back at yourself because you have to guess at where the center button is or else you will hit one of the other touch sensitive buttons. After about 4 months of use the screen went completly white, and without insurance i was forced to buy a new phone. I went with the LG 8300 instead and so far it has been a vast improvement on my original chocolate. Dont be drawn in by the excessive advertisments and steer clear of this phone!"
5,verizon chcolate review,This is the best phone ever!!! The people that say this phone is bad are insane. The V cast music is easy and cheap. V cast has all the latest and oldest songs from rock to gospel to rap and hip hop. The verizon chocolate can hold up to 1000 songs with the memory card. The memory card is only 30$. Without the memory card the phone can hold up to 12 songs.
1,i hate the chocolate,"i hate this phone. camera sucks. i have had this phone since december and the key pad and screen is already cracked. I dont mistreat my phone either. very ""un-durable"" the phone is already jammed to and i have a hard time getting it open. beware...looks are decieving by the way im not a kid"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!,"I got this phone because I thought it looked so cool and I wanted something that was stylish and functioned well. When I got this I powered it on and so far so good. When I actually started using it, like many of the other reviewers here, I was TOTALLY ANNOYED by the touch screen!! When I put my phone up to my ear, it would mute my calls and randomly dial people!!!! I was SO frustrated, I almost threw the thing OUT of the window of my car!!!!! I hate this phone worse than any I've ever had!!! I had the touch options at the lowest ( sensitivity ) and it still dialed and muted!!! UGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH!!! I will never go with high tech again. Give me an old regular cell phone please!!!!! I just want to CALL SOMEONE!! LOL"
3,Question,"Hi there....I want to buy this phone, but i have seen a lot of bad comments about this phone...I have a few questions about this phone..I have to sign ONE year contract or TWO years?Actually, i am in the US now, but can i use this phone in HongKong..?THANKS!"
2,Unimpressed...,"I thought I would love this phone. However, it has only been a source of frustration for me.-Its perception of when I'm speaking is horrible- I frequently have to repeat what I've said for my conversational partners (I thought my mom had a hearing loss initially...).-It is very sensitive to touch! It is scary how easily it can call the last person I talked to or the first person in my contacts (which I recently created ""A Voicemail"" as the first slot in my contacts vs. my friend Alexandra).-The organization of the mp3 player is nothing like the iPod.Overall, I would never buy this phone again and would not recommend it to anyone in the market."
2,Seriously flawed,"I want to love this phone. It's beautiful and has awesome features, but it's one of the most awkward phones I have ever used. I have very small fingers and I still hit all the wrong ""buttons"" on the touchpad and end up fumbling and going to the wrong places all the time. Additionally, the number/letter buttons are far too small. I'm normally a super-speedy texter, but it takes me SO much longer to type out a message.I hate to have to return this phone, because it's really a lovely phone, but it's very difficult to use.LG could vastly improve it by making the touchpad into actual buttons (attempting to copy iPod's touch wheel was a disaster), and making the buttons slightly larger."
1,Check your zip code.,"Before you go into hysterics about getting the phone, check your zip code. Availability of service is limited."
2,short lived VX8500 - 8550 better?,"Bought an LG VX8500 Chocolate a year ago, fell and broke it, insurance replaced it with a defective refurbished phone. They quickly replaced that one with a brand new phone. It worked great for 16 total hours (about 6 months) and suddenly it won't power on. It goes on/off/on/off/on/off, until you remove the battery. Would not get another one! The NEW LG Chocolate VX8550 comes highly recommended, they say the issues with the 8500 have been resolved with this one. Have one on the way, hope they're right."
1,Looks nice but leaves a bad taste in your mouth.,"Absolute junk. Had to exchange 3 of them in 2 weeks. Lots of known problems with these phones, I guess I should have done some research first. Verizon was kind enough to let me trade it in for a LG 8300."
3,MP3 Software is NOT compatible with your Apple computer,"I bought this phone for my daughter for Christmas. She is so thrilled with the looks and MP3 function that I have never heard her complain about reception or the keypad. After talking to 4 or 5 Verizon reps, I understood that I would have to pay the extra $30 for the music software, however it wasn't until we opened the package that we found out it would NOT run on a Mac operating system. It was quite a lengthy process to burn music to CDs and then go to someone else's house to use their Windows System. Without the software, you cannot load music. Verizon really should offer 2 versions of the software, and if not, explain it clearly to people before they spend their money."
4,Sexy phone.,"I love the color and design of the phone. It's very nice. My only problems with the phone would be the touchpad and the camera. Sometimes I accidentally put my fingers on the touchpad and somehow call someone. As for the camera, sometimes when I try to use it the view screen will be black. But if you close out of camera mode and go back it'll work fine."
2,Great gadget but only fair reception,The LG chocolate phone excels as a media player. With a 2 gig memory card you can store pictures and songs. With the camera you can take fair quality pictures. The MP3 playback is excellent quality (for a cell phone) and if you get the accessory kit the ear buds are sweet. Not so sweet are the problems others have stated - like the phone dialing people if I touch a button. The reception also isn't the best. The glitches make me wonder if there's a software update for the phone everybody needs to get >> this phone can be software updated. I've tried #28 (which I think is for reprogramming) but still working with Verizon to get it fixed right.
2,Don't Buy It,"I purchased this phone through Verizon because it looked good and it had a nice sliding feature. BUTAfter starting to use it this is what I found out: 1. The connection is bad, the voice cuts-off with this phone 2. The charger plugging is difficult 3. The touch-sensor buttons will activate if something touches them or you have to aim and tap exactly right or else you hit a wrong button 1/4"" away. A simple act of going through menu takes 3 times longer. 4. The voice-command system says: ""Please say a command"" then investigates your command by asking again, that makes fast voice-command as slow as dialing. 5. There is no button on the front to end a call and dial another, so you have to slide the phone closed then re-open or find the small side-button. 6. There are only a few bad ringer sounds inside, so they force you to purchase decent ringers. 7. There's no easy speaker system.And I haven't even used the MP3 yet!Buy a different phone by Nokia instead."
1,Not Worth It!!!,"My husband recieved this phone this past year. He was SO excited to get it. First off, to actually be able to store music on this thing you have to purchase the music pack which is almost $60.00. We vacillated whether we should get the pack or not because it is a fair amount of money and decided to wait a few weeks to think on it. Unfortunately, the decision was made for us. The touch screen buttons became increasingly difficult to use. Before long we were practically punching the stupid thing with our fingers just to get the phone to dial. THE TOUCH SCREEN WILL WEAR OUT WITHIN 4 MONTHS!!! Touch screens for a phone is not practical. If you want to purchase a new phone within a few months then go for it. Otherwise, purchase a phone you can actually dial with.However, the verizon service is fabulous. I would just suggest getting a different phone, one without a touch screen."
1,Don't buy it.,"This phone was awesome at first. I bought it for $300. I had no problems for a while.Then after about 9 or 10 months the touch screen decided when it wanted to work, and when I slide it open it would call people. So you can't call people when you want ot, but when you want to open it to do other things it calls the first person on you most recent calls list. Not cool.I love the music feature on this phone, it is a great idea but I think they should have tried to get the kinks out of it before they sold it for $300 only for it to not even work after less than a year."
2,Dumb Blonde,"Well, it's pretty, but that's about it.I loved this phone in the store. The sound of the mp3s were good, and I thought I would like the touch sensitive controls because I love them on my iPod. However, when I'm talking on the phone, my ear starts pressing buttons, even so far as to muting my conversation!Also, I didn't realize I'd have to buy an adapter to upload music, and still not be able to set it as a ringtone! What a waste of $40!My main other complaint is the texting capability. I use punctuation in my text messages, but because the touch controls time-out while I'm texting, I almost have to close the phone in order to add an exclamation point or to send the message.The camera is nice - about the same as the camera in my last phone.Short and sweet - save your money."
1,Too much Chocolate makes you sick,"The LG VX8500 Chocolate is a sleek looking phone, however, that may be the only upside to this utterly unreliable device. Using a new technology of touch sensitivity, the phone is difficult to use and constantly dials numbers while it should be locked. It is a mystery each day how the phone will respond to the owner's touch. Sometimes, the slightest brush will produce a cornucopia of responses, while other times the phone simply ignores everything. The speakerphone is barely audible, and one is better off putting a regular call on the highest volume. After a while, my send key started malfunctioning, so it was indefinite whether or not I could actually make a call. The phone is not even structurally sound as, after only four months, the phone literally started to break in half. The phone's negative aspects are so overwhelming, if there are redeeming features to this dicey phone, they do not even matter."
4,overall good phone,"First of all the people who through verizon to dowload all music and programs will get ripped off this is why the phone can be affordable. If you just search for programs on the internet like bitpim u can move all your files back and forth, whether they are ringtones or wallpapers, dont pay for it! You will need the music essentials kit for the usb cable maybe 20 bucks or less. The battery talktime isnt the best ever but its acceptable. I love the phone though, easy to use once u get used to and a very unique design. With this advice you won't be dissapointed."
2,"Ok phone, but not for me...","Ok, when I forst got the phone from UPS and opened the Amazon box, and then opened the phone box I had second thoughts as soon as I seen it. The phone looks cool when its ""closed"", but as soon as you ""open"" it the big slop between the really small keypad is just ugly. The glossy touch got on my nerves, ok, its hot wear I live and when I'm out and my hands aren't at their coolest point, I hesitate using this phone because I am scared that it would slip out of my hands. The camera is really good, but its almost impossible to ""push"" the OK button to take the pic. And I kind of noticed the when the phone was pushed up, I could wiggle the phone both left to right, and front to back, I returned the phone today, and got the RAZR, I would tell anyone to NOT get this phone. Sorry."
1,Never another LG product,"I put up with this phone for a year. There are many engineering problems with it. The touch pad is so sensitive that if you touch it to your cheek while using it, it will hang up your call, open menus, etc. The dialing buttons are so small that it was rare to dial a whole ten-digit number without hitting two buttons at once. From when the phone was a few months old the headphone jack had to be jiggled to use it. Finally, two days after the warranty expired the send button stopped working completely. To dial a number that I had not previously saved I had to enter it (after several tries with the tiny buttons), save it into contacts, then select it from the contacts list. This phone was made for style, not use."
2,LG Chocolate,"Im disappointed with this phone. You pay $200 and it doesnt even come with a headset to listen to the music. On tv it says it has all of these features but its a joke cuz nothing is free. You shouldnt have to pay for all of these ""extras,"" they should be included. I actually like the phone but do yourself a favor and get a normal phone. Im giving it a bad review, not because its a bad phone but because Verizon is cheap and everything is ""big business."" What im trying to say is that its not worth nearly what your paying for it."
2,not impressed,"I have the phone for 5 days now.it is a nice small phone, but as someone else said the sensitivity of the touch pad is frustrating even on low.the speaker is in the rear of the device and there is no separate ear plug port making it not compatible to all those earbuds you have from your old phones.I am using V-cast for the month free the clips are a couple of minutes long. I am not sure if you get full half hour of programs with subscription.Battery is used very quickly when you use Vcast or ""get it now"".i am still thinking about sending it back for the LG v3800 which my husband has. it is easier to handle and the two large speakers on phone makes it a better mp3 player.and lastly yes Verizon gives you user guides but they are from verizon and not LG."
3,"OK, but not for Mac","I bought this at a Verizon store and then returned it after finding out it wouldn't work with my Mac, despite the salesman's urging that it would.OK, I could make it work if I really wanted to work at it, but I have two iPods and couldn't justify the extra effort.I was suprised it didn't have a headphone jack built in. Too bad.Overall, if you have a PC and not an iPod I suppose this could be fun (after some major additional purchases) but it pretty much left me flat."
1,Unplanned calls,I am frustrated with the Chocolate. It sometimes automaticly connects and begins calling someone when I open the phone. The touch pad is extremely sensitive and is constantly sending me places I don't want to go. In the end I have given up out of frustation and bought another phone that is less annoying.
2,Really wanted to like it,"I bought this phone in August and really wanted to like it. I used the MP3 player, the camera, the phone and most everything else including VCast. Shortly after getting the phone, I noticed that it would call people on its own and would do many things even if I only touched one button. When it started getting cold, I found that buttons and the phone would freeze and I could not use them. The touch pad would seem overly sensitive at times and at other times I had to hit the pad very hard to get any result even though I had the sensitivity set at medium.Needless to say, I have purchased a new phone, hopefully with better results. I do have to disagree with one of the reviewers in that the people at Verizon were very helpful and understanding when I explained my problem and while they did not let me just trade phones, they did help me a little in getting my new one."
1,Can't tell a phone by its cover,"Yes, it's pretty, but it isn't easy to use. I really dislike the touch pad -- sometimes it works right away when you press a button, and sometimes it doesn't.You have to slide it completely out of the case to answer it.The MP3 player isn't as easy to program as your average MP3 player. I'm not sure why I want one in my phone anyway.It is definitely not worth the hype."
2,Difficult Interface,"I had some time to spend with this phone and found the interface very confusing. I was never quite for sure what motions were actually doing what. In some areas of the phone, you just barely lay your finger down and it causes something to happen, in other areas, the right amount of assumed pressure is required.Since then, I have listened a tech review of the phone and it was described as having a steep learning curve on familiarizing one's self with the interface, so I didn't feel so bad. Plus, it is probably the first phone I ever felt confused using.It does look nice, but I would not compare it near to the style of an iPod Nano, though, as some have."
1,The worst phone I ever owned,"I was talked into this phone by the verizon sales person. It is impossible to dial without hitting the wrong numbers, the sound on your calls is terrible and people are constantly telling me they can't hear me. In order to use the v-cast function you have to pay 15.95 per month to have the download service plus the 1.99 per song - verizon didn't tell me that so now I have a crappy phone that I can't even download new songs without paying a ton of money. The worst phone I have ever owned."
2,It was cool at first.,"I got this phone 7 months ago because it looked cool. No other reason. Ever since I got it, people have been complaining that they can't hear me very well, and I have some trouble hearing them too. Also, the buttons are so small that it creates problems when texting- pressing two buttons at once. You need a dialing wand or something. Other than that, I haven't had any problems with it until today, when it went completely haywire. Initially it just froze up, so I tried to turn it off, but the screen just went completely white. I had to take the battery off to get it to turn off, and I haven't been able to turn it back on since. When I try I sometimes get the white screen, sometimes I get the verizon logo. This is so frustrating."
4,Cure From the Pig!,"This is one of my fave. eppy out of all the Ranma videos. The episode is with Ranma (of course)at a public bath. Shampoo has a miracle soap,(it will cure you from any curse). Shampoo accidently drops it in Ryoga's washing tub! Now Ranma and Shampoo are after the soap to get the cure."
2,Great watch but no Documents,"This is a very beautiful watch. Amazon sells it at an extremely attractive price. Ordered the watch and received in a couple of days. It's too bad the watch didn't come with any authenticity cards. I contacted customer service but they offered no feasible solution. They told me to contact the manufacturer to get replacement cards. I was completely baffled that Amazon would not resolve the issue themselves. I decided to return the watch immediately for a refund. Amazon processed the refund quite easily but I am still waiting for them to reimburse my shipping costs, it was over $30. For the price of the watch, if there isn't authenticity cards, RETURN IT. Otherwise, it is a great looking watch."
1,NOT what was advertised.,"It advertises itself as a general guide in planning your theses or dissertations; however, when I got the book, the introduction says that it only applies to social sciences and not other fields. Everything in the book has to do with social science related research, so the book was of no help. I wish I could get my money back!"
1,cologne,The nozzle that the cologne sprays out of broke on me so not I have an empty bottle of brand new cologne its still attached and everything it just won't spray out.Thank you
4,Who doesn't want to throw bad guys against walls?,"I have so much fun playing this game. You can pick up objects or enemies with telekinesis and chuck 'em around, you can catch them on fire, you can control their minds and make them kill each other, and more. You have to regain your powers because your memory has been wiped, but you get a new power at regular intervals. The story is not very clever or unique, but it's okay. The music is alright, too. The graphics are somewhat dull for Playstation 2, but they're clean. All around, this is an average game in most parts but it's very fun to play."
3,Okay game,"This game was not all it was cracked up to be, I have played it a number of times, and i have never finished it. The controls are not all that great especially when shooting targets and moving around. It was nice though when controlling your psi powers, but for minute movements it either moved too fast, or too slow.Pros - nice psi powers, training mode, and musiccons - not all that great graphics, and terrible control"
5,Great game... <-- Title. Derp.,"This is a really interesting game. There are a variety of psychic abilities unlocked throughout the game. The controls can be split up between two players, one controlling movement and aiming and firing the gun, and the other controlling the psychic abilities. The latter requires highly functional communication skills. The first player in control of the body has to aim at what the person in control over the mind desires to interact with.Game play is cool. It gives you a lot of choices and puzzles. And the story was interesting enough. It has been a while since I played the game and recently bought it for nostalgia.The game ends as though there should be a sequel, but there isn't. That's the biggest disappointment about this game for me.And now a haiku. Note the seasonal word.Awesome mind powers.You can play as Scorpion.The story just stops."
3,Beading on a Loom,"This is a nice book with great pictures. However, I think it is important to note that if you are searching for a beginner's how to loom book, this might not be a good starting point. The author does include many patterns and some lovely photos of exquisite loomwork, but the patterns are for folks who have some loom experience behind them."
2,"Nice eye candy, but no patterns. Save your money.","Sometimes one can judge a book by its cover and get a good idea of the contents. Sometimes the cover is deceiving eye candy but there's precious little by way of content. That's what this book is: eye candy alone.The how-to instructions inside are so basic that any brand new novice has mastered them in 10 minutes. These instructions can be found in any beading book or free doing a Google search.This book is largely an exercise in ego: bragging rights by the author and, moreover, 90% of his designs are identical save for the color and type of bead used - identical pattern and execution of design.There's a reason this title has so many 'used' books for sale, and that is due to the above mentioned areas.So save your money and borrow it from a library, and use your money to buy some beading books that are going to give the bead artist something to go on. I am really disappointed."
2,Not yet received,I have not yet received this product so cannot tell you...was sent about feb 8 and this is feb 22 and it isn't here yet...
1,Don't waste your money,"First, this is not for the metal beyblades. Common sense to many I'm sure, but I'm a dad buying for his son. I didn't know the difference between ""V force"" and ""metal fusion"".Second. My son used this exactly once. Upon the first pull the plastic ripcord broke. I have never seen those break with any of his other launchers.Third, I'm not sure if it's the plastic beyblades in general, or this launcher. But it stinks, they barely spin."
2,It SUCKS!,"The gears in it, that it needs to launch two beyblades, drastically slow down your launch.It makes the Full Auto Clutch Base useless because it never goes through its ""attack mode"" which is an essential for the battle and for balance to run the ""endurance or free-spin mode"". At least with SOME other special launchers you can take out the actual launcher piece for repair or replacement but I can see how this is impossible for this idea."
2,OHMYGOD IT BURNS!,"I used this, thinking it'd be sort of a lip-balmy stuff (because that's what the girl at Sephora told me) and after 2 days of use my lips swelled up so much I had ducklip/troutlip and I formed a red rash around my lip line that had little red bumps (like pimples?). In the words of Napoleon Dynamite - MY LIPS HURT REAL BAD! They're scaling; they're bumpy; they feel grainy. And it's not like my face is uber sensitive or anything - I use DuWop lip venom glosses and my lips feel fine. This stuff hurts. :( And I'm definitely returning it."
2,Monster Dog,"A group of rock 'n rollers end up dead meat when they run across a mutant beast on the road home to their next show, but they soon find out that the monster may actually be walking among them! Alice Cooper leads this awful mess of a monster movie, which can't decide if it is a killer animal flick, a werewolf tale, or a ghost story. Its convenient plot seems like nothing more than a poor excuse to throw Cooper on stage in a few cheesy music video moments. MONSTER DOG'S hand-puppet monster is likewise a laughable joke, but thankfully it is kept shrouded in the fog for the majority of the film. The only shot that is even worth mentioning in the entire picture is a shotgun blast that cleaves a guy's skull in two, but other than that this is a trashy creature-feature out of Spain that can easily be missed.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
3,Rare footage of 80's Cooper Videos,"If your considering buying this movie it is probably because Alice Cooper is in. The best feature of this movie are the videos of a couple of the songs from his 80-83 years. I haven't seen this in awhile but I believe there were two songs from ""Zipper Catches Skin"" made into videos for this movie. The movie itself is a low budget South American affair and has been a cause of great embarressment for Alice."
3,For diehard Cooper fans only,"Me and my wife got this because she's the big Alice Cooper fan(atic) and so is her mom. We knew going in that it was going to be a very very bad movie, which helped us enjoy it for what it was... a pretty weak excuse to get Cooper doing some mediocre acting and some decent singing in his only movie. His surrounding cast's performance helps not at all and the monster effects are what is expected of a very low budget 80's horror flick.Good for a laugh or three, as a collectible for a Cooper collection and (in my case) for falling asleep on the couch. You have been warned!"
2,DVD Review,"This DVD is region 0 fullscreen and was made from a vhs tape. Not great quality nor any special features. Unless you really must see this movie out of curiosity, don't spend more than a few bucks for it. You are probably better off just buying the vhs tape.For fans of director Claudio Fragasso, this is nowhere near as entertaining as Troll 2. It's very sluggish in most parts and Alice Cooper's voice is dubbed.On the plus side: Cooper's musical performances are quite good - this coming from a non-fan. Also, the last couple of minutes of the movie of Cooper's ""American Werewolf in London""-like transformation are truly hilarious."
3,Monster Dog,"The movie is a 1star CHEESY CHEEZY movie,The Dubbing and editing is bad and the acting,It's made in Spain and the only cool thing about it Is Alice Cooper is In it, So that's a plus for Alice Cooper Fans,the Minus is having to watch the movie."
2,ProFit Universal Phone Mount,"I had this product in my car for just over a year. I really liked it. It was easy to mount, compatible with any cell phone, etc. However, I found that, this summer, with my car being parked in an open parking lot during the day at work, the adhesive melted. I was not able to reattach the device to my dashboard."
2,Not compatible with the Motorola P280 Phone,I almost lost my phone with this device. The Motorola P280 does not really have a good location to stick the adhesive sticker.
2,This thing works!,"I have an UltiMount in my 16-year-old sons 89 GMC Jimmy. It works, he always has his phone there and we can contact him because he can find his phone. I think it makes him a safer driver because he does not have to fumble for the phone; it is always within arms reach. I also use one to hold my phone at my desk when I am calling out of my home office. It is totally adjustable and looks good too! I recommend them to everyone. The instructions are great and the kit is complete. You get a car mount, belt clip and buttons that will work on Nokia, or any other phones. This product is very good."
5,Cool Holder,"I have tried several different holders for my phone, none work as well as this one. My husband liked mine so much he bought one for himself and all his sales staff. Its just cool."
5,Forty years in two hours,"Quite aside from this 2 disk set surpassing the sound & production quality of any live offering I've heard, this is a superb effort by original Blues Project & BS&T members, plus the ReKooperators and guests.There is only one way to listen to this album. Gather All Things Al aficionados, enjoy your favourite libation and enjoy.It's all there; Super Session, You Can't Always Get...with a trombone instead of Al's french horn.The only negative is that Steve Katz decided, apparently after the gig, that his guitar was not to be on the album. The negative is eliminated by Al's production artistry. Goodbye Katz and thanks to Jimmy Vivino & Oniviv Ymmij for helping make this offering a perfect overview of the best of the last 50 years of popular music."
4,"Small book, big words.","This book is a great resource for those who want to get at what Mr. Eisenman is all about. It is a surprisingly straightforward account of what he has been up to for the past thirty years or more(Straightforward for Eisenman, at any rate). The book does require careful scrutiny, just looking at the pictures will get you nowhere."
1,"Very, very basic","Very basic information. If you never maintained a motorcycle (like, never changed an air filter) this might be an interesting video. Adventure touring instruction? No. Go to the ""adventure rider"" web page for serious information. Hard to believe that this is sold for ~ $30 on Amazon."
1,Not F650GS specific,Just the very basics and not at all specific to the F650GS. No inside BMW knowledge here.If you know how to change a spark plug and air filter you don't need this DVD. Very dissapoited.
4,More fun than a barrel of monkeys,"In this digitally mastered age where perfectly virtuosic performances threaten to lose their capacity to amaze, Edgar Meyer does it brilliantly by making the most unwieldy of behemoth instruments dance on its toes. ...his compositional skills, while impressive, lose some of their glitz paired with his incredible virtuosity. But, they are very enjoyable works. The concerto for Bass works particularly well, I feel: it is effective as both a showcase of his abilities as a performer, has real musical interest, and pulls traditionally American musical ideas into the mix without sounding trite.As an aside, not since Glenn Gould have I enjoyed a performer's ""spontaneous vocal improvisation"" additions on a recording. Meyer's percussive exhalations on off-beats in the highly rhythmic passages (especially in the 3rd movement of the Bottesini concerto and in the duet) are too much fun!"
4,Mixed bag,"Meyer's playing is, to my ear, impeccable, and with the addition of Bell and Yo-Yo Ma you have three great virtuosos playing on this CD.My only problem is that I love the Bottesini works and feel so-so on his own compositions. I feel that the audience would have been better served if he had created two CDs; one with Bottesini bass works (and other standard classical music) and one with his own ""Appalachian-style"" compositions.I don't think that his own compositions are necessarily bad; I just don't particularly appreciate them as much as I do his playing of classical repertoire.One thing to commend, though, is that Meyer is taking an instrument that lacks a large library of music and featuring it in remarkable performances of existant pieces as well as creating his own works."
3,Repertoire Problems,"Briefly, the double-bass repertoire problems continue. Bottesini, just about the only composer for the instrument you could call well-known, isn't all that good, and, here, Meyer has composed some music of his own that is even more second-rate: blues and jazz stylings, ""Americana"".Another problem with double bass music is that listeners are usually attracted to its low register, while performers - like Meyer here - try to prove themselves by taking it into the challenging, really high register. As a result, the listener feels cheated, so it is with double disappointment one listens to this CD.Still, Bottesini's concert is solid. In the absence of that much better double-bass material, this twenty-five per cent solidity means a sure three stars. Meyer's playing, of course, surpasses even the highest expectations."
2,Bottessini,"This CD was interesting, but most of the selections were not good music. There was one selection out of all, which was probably why I wanted to own this CD. Interesting double bass works."
1,"Not a big fan of this game, missing the old arcade version.","I would not reccomend this game to some people only because the computer can be hard, it just gets frustrating when you're in the lead then the computer activates a sweet spot and oh, scores a 3 point dunk to make you lose. The only problem is this isnt' a rare instance, this happens all the time! I'm the same person that would win regularly on NHL 2002 with the diffuculty all the way up, it's okay for you to cheat and find secrets but for the computer to do it, that's not fair to the player, of the 20 or so games I've played on this over the weekend I've lost all of them, I've never lost an NHL game before. This is so much harder than the old NBA jam I used to play, and also, when you grow to appreciate real good sports games from EA sports there really is no need to buy this arcade crap."
2,nba jam,i reckon its not as good as nba street volume 2 and is more expensive its graphic arnt good cause the people have big head and look short so do the nets i prefer nba street volume 2 cause it is ace graphics like the espn nba game
2,Not the best basketball game,"I rented this game over the weekend, and boy was i suprised. This is one of the most unrealistic games of the century. The bodies are badly molded, the controls are a bit confusing, and it could use some more game modes. If you must play this game, rent it, don't waste $50, it's not worth it."
5,fits camry 99 perfectly,"this item worked perfectly on my camry 99, it was a cheap perfect fit. it looks nice when you replace the original stereo and dont know what to do with open space.great buy, great fit."
2,Needs some modification,"I've got a 2009 Toyota Tacoma and this doesn't fit very well. In fact, it's a pain to work with. I had to get out the Dremmel tool and shave some off the plastic mounting brackets so it would slide in the din sleeve and and also had to drill new holes.It was also missing a mounting screw, but I dealt with that."
2,Really?,The spacer came with itself a screw and a advertising paper for the company. No instructions or anything. I couldn't figure why I got a screw and Eventually I got so mad i couldn't figure out how it goes on I just duct taped it. Problem solved.
5,Perfect fit,"Needed this pocket for a 1997 Toyota Camry. It fit perfectly in the OEM brackets. If you're looking for this particular part with the same type vehicle, it was perfect for what I needed. It's big enough to hold an iPhone and the lip on the inside will keep it from falling out. I am very pleased with the product itself.My only caution would be the shipping process. All I got was an email that said it shipped and a date range when it might show up. I chose free shipping. Little frustrating to not know where the package is or when it was arriving or who the shipper was. It arrived at the last date in the range and was in great shape. Just be aware of that one little possible frustration - not worth dropping it a star in rating, though."
3,Digitl safe,"I have two of these safe's in my coin safe. I use them to house specific ""lose"" items that have been just lying on the shelves of my coin safe. The construction of these safe's are not ""Fort Knox"" but acceptable for what they are being used for. Do not expect them to be something that a thief could not carry away and have opened in less than 15 minutes worth of effort."
2,Handle hard to grab hold of,I purchased this safe because I have used similar ones in hotel rooms and the combination feature appealed to me.The combination is easy enough to set but when you go to turn the handle to open the door it is set in such a manner that makes it hard to grab hold of. You actually have to use your other hand and also pull on the left side of the face panel.The handle should be larger and protrude out from the the front so you can grab onto it.If this item weren't so heavy I would ship it back for a refund but it is adequate for my needs and it is a sturdy box.
4,Safe / Security storage box,"This safe/box was purchased for my son to take to college to store expensive items such as digital camera, IPod and other small items and money. It will not keep a determined thief from stealing the entire box but it would make it much more obvious to see someone walking down the hall with a large gray steel box. The combination is easy to set and there is a removable shelf to help make the space more usable. The one item that the safe/box is missing is a way to attach a cable to the box to a fixed point like you do a laptop computer to make the box harder to just pick up and walk away with. Shipping was a bit high, almost as much as the safe/box itself."
5,Not Good... What???,"I have two pistols that I use for protection and keep the both in here with room for 3 boxes of pistol amoo and have 3 boxes of shottie shells and still have a little room left over. I am not sure what everyones problem is with this, but for the money I can't complain at all. IT has never failed and is still on the first set of batteries after a year or so. I would definetly recomend this to anyone that is needing one to keep the kids out or anyone else for that matter!!"
3,Not as pictured but still a decent value,"This item was not exactly as pictured when it arrived. The key pad was different, and looked a bit cheaper. However, it still seemed to be a good value."
4,Roomy safe to protect your valuables,"There's not much difference between this Neiko safe and the Stack-On PS-514. Both have a shelf (which I wanted); the Stack-on (presumably 1.0 CF based on the size, the description doesn't actually say)is 13-3/16"" W (35cm), 9-13/16"" D (25cm), 9-13/16"" H (25cm) inches while the Neiko is 1.0 CF and measures 14""W x 10""D x 10""H. The only main difference is the slightly lower price of the Neiko. The hinges are hidden, though the door is a bit loose to accommodate the 2 bolts. Overall, a nice box to at least hinder a burglar."
5,Perfect size safe,"I purchased this safe for 2 reasons. 1: My wife and I were looking for a place to store important papers such as birth certificates, passports, etc... 2: I was looking for a safe with relatively easy access for myself and my wife to put in our bedroom and store a handgun in for protection. We have a small child and I did not want a loaded handgun anywhere near him or in anyway accessable for him. This was a great solution. It is small enough to put on a shelf in our bedroom closet, had an electronic lighted keypad for late night quick entry, and had enough room for important papers and a small handgun. It even has room to spare. The only drawback for me, is that it is not fireproof. If being fireproof is not important for you, than I highly reccomend this safe."
1,Unsafe,"The safe's electronic and key locks work. However, it provides low security. It's light and needs to be bolted down if you don't want people to just walk away with it. Even if you did, it remains frail. The side and back walls aren't even a millimeter thick. I don't feel safe storing valuables in it because people could just bust this up with a one handed sledgehammer."
3,Neiko Digital Electronic Safe for Home or Businss - 1.0 Cubic Ft,"Was a little disappointed that the safe came 3 days after the date it was scheduled to arrive, overall I was somewhate pleased that it was easy to program; it's a little light weight and looks nothing like the picture. Nevertheless, you get what you pay for!"
2,not what i payed for,this safe was the perfect size for what i needed. i have to lock up medicine from my children so i thought the 1 cubic foot was the perfect size. wanted the digital key lock so they couldn't find a key if they felt the need to get into it for any reason. a key safe isn't safe for kids in my opinion so the number pad was the better option. this safe was a great price for the size and function only to get it home to find that the key pad wouldn't work dispite the batteries being changed. it wouldn't lock when activated and the knob just turned to open without the number lock being entered. not safe or protective. had to return not even worth the hassle of ordering another due to they seem to be refurbished. and not very well if i may add.
1,UN safe,Do not buy this product. I bought this safe to keep light money and most important prescriptions out of the wrong hands. Did not take long to notice things missing. Finally when caught red handed I got the culprit to show me how entry was made. All they had to do was remove the pad and jiggle the mster key hole with a small slim metal key turned it to the right and the safe opened. I am so angry. This is a piece of garbage and dangerous to put trust in it.
5,Great Safe,"Item received on time & in good condition. GREAT SAFE for the money!The safe was exactly as pictured in the ad, everything worked as promised!! The only thing I didn't like was the mounting hardware, OK for concrete floors but not very good for a BLOCK wall. Had to buy different hardware for that. Don't know why all the negative & poor reviews,this safe is a lot of bang for very few bucks!!"
4,fathers day present,"Just gave this to hubby for fathers day. He liked it. It has more room then I thought. You can use the shelf provided, which divides the safe in half lengthwise, or not. The key or comb. pad entry was good idea. It seems well built and perfect size. The reason for the four star is he has not had a chance to see how it holds up, but it seems to be a nice safe."
3,A gift,I actually bought this as a gift for my step father and he loves it. It is roomy and sturdy which is what he really cared about. A definite win for a guy who just needs to feel a bit more secure.
3,Heavy but junkie,"Shipping was fast from the company. The safe itself was not packaged very well and rattled a lot when being opened. Took a while to get set up with a new code because the batteries that came with it were almost dead. Changed those and everything went smoothly. It is not as well made as I would like but the safe will secure my items from little hands, the whole purpose of getting it. Overall I would rate it a three star product."
4,Affordable- Keeps the honest people out,"This is my second order of the same safe. The first safe, the batteries went dead before I could change them, installed for over three years. It wouldn't had been a problem if I remembered what I did with the emergency key to open the box. To get passports out for a trip, I used a heavy hammer and big screwdriver to bust the weld near the safe door. This box is strong enough to keep kids and honest people out, but not someone with tools. It took about 10 minutes to rip the door off, and I'm a fairly strong guy. I'm not dogging the safe, but you get what you paid for. To me, it was worth buying again."
3,Nice Safe with a couple of irritations,"The safe is great for keeping small - medium sized items and other valuables, comes with bolts and equipment to fasten it to the floor. Downsides are the keypad beep is extremely loud and unless u put in some cabinet stoppers the door rattles a lot."
1,NOT SAFE,Do not buy this and put a gun in it. I found out that some safes made in china of later could be opened rather easilly so I tried it on this one and sure enough.... all you have to do is pick the LOCKED safe up from it's right side and drop it... and the door swings open. Not kidding. My .45 slid right out onto the floor. Apparently several kids have been killed due to safes using this design getting into them and finding weapons or whatever. I bolted mine to the floor and will have to buy a new one eventually.Oh yea and... the entire thing as about the same level of quality build as something you'd buy at the dollar store. It's complete crap.
2,Doesn't look strong,"I saw the pictures looks strong and decent for the price, but after I got it, the keypad works fine, but build and finish doesn't look strong enough to secure your valuable items. the door was not cut evenly, the inside paint job was sloppy. Just see the picture and decide yourself."
1,Neiko Digital Safe Minus Zero,The electronics of the unit did not work at all. It beeped and blinked but you could not make it work. The instructions were written by someone not familiar with spoken or written English
1,In Utero: Rock Milestones,"I am a bit disillusioned because it is not the album, it is only the history"
5,Great for expanding reach,"This item is a must for all of you who want bigger range of antennas.I bought this to connect a big roof antenna to my radio scanner, al OK.Recommended."
4,Incredible Latke recipe,"This book is one of the cutest and most helpful books on the topic of Jewish cooking I have ever read. My strudel is always a disaster, but after following her recipe, it finally turned out right.....after 20 years. The latke recipe was helpful as well. It's just an overall happy, fun book."
2,Not What I Expected,"The bifold was very flimsy and didn't even come with the pad of paper that was adveritsed with the product. Although, returning the product was easy."
5,fantastic,This is literally one of the best fantasy book series you can ever take the time to read. The hero is like no other you will encounter.

4,What a blast!!,"Now this books is what the term ""rollicking good fun"" was created for. Good bit of blood and guts, great humor and a wild ride make this book something that surprised the hell out of me. I highly recommend it!"
4,Great - but not suberb,"Heroe's Die is very similar to the 'Adept' series written by Piers Anthony. Two worlds one dominated by technology the other by magic - the key elements that Stover has going as an author are his ability to write a thrilling battle, and the fairly unexpected bonus that his hero 'Caine' does tend to get hurt [although the effects of his being hurt never quite translates into the next battle]. A sequel is quite possible here as questions of ethics and philosophy based on each worlds systems are raised but never quite resolved. If you want a semi-original 'swashbuckling' adventure this is a fine book to read. Its no 'Armor' by John Steakley, but its still a nice read."
2,mediocre all around,...it jams frequently when trying to send a fax (I find myself having to stand next to it and feed papers through a lot.) It works well receiving though and the print and copy quality is OK. It's [an inexpensive]fax machine - you get what you pay for.
1,Don't buy Pansonic fax machine KX-FPC161,"Panasonic KX-FPC161This fax machine is poorly designed, having an obvious design flaw on a clip inside the unit that keeps the top closed.I had one break and the service from panasonic was extremly poor.No parts were available at all- backordered to Japan & no mention of when they would arrive.I fought them long enough to finally get a new machine, then the same part broke again.Faulty design, poor service & warranty- DONT BUY FROM PANASONIC"
3,FAX me,"The ribbon tends to reach its end very quick, automatically printing the caller ID doesn't help its cause. As a FAX, it works well enough, do not try to use it to copy except maybe very rarely. Not a very good copier, if it were me, I wouldn't even advertise the copy function."
1,Update to my first review.,"This machine has a paper jam of 10 pages for every 1 page it actually prints. I am so disgusted with this product with my only recourse is having Panasonic send out a new (refurbished) machine, though I don't expect any different performance. It's just a BAD DESIGN."
5,Quite satisfied with this machine,"I've been quite pleased with this inexpensive home fax/copier since I got it a week ago. Setup went without a hitch (I was surprised). I had a question about what phone line to use and Panasonic tech support was pleasant and competent in answering my question. I've had NO problems at all with any of the features I've used including auto answer and I've had no paper jams. Fax quality is quite acceptable using plain laser/typing paper. This has proven to be a perfect machine for my home user needs. While someone else may have gotten a lemon, I have zero complaints."
2,Illusionist songwriting,"2 1/2I suppose LF is as an agreeable entry into the group's distinctive brand of tortured indie-pop as any, though what little gripping power the music once had from under-produced proddings and whispered eccentricities have all but faded over time for me."
4,Dense Reference Book,"Probability Theory I is a very dense reference book. It contains a large amount of useful specific results, but the scarcity of explanatory remarks makes it a difficult casual read."
4,Inspiring .....,"I got this book only a few months ago and I must say it has been a wealth of information. I learned about toxic plants, diseases, grazing management, budgeting your opperation effiecently, and also info on different feeding scales of species. Not to mention everything on this book but it has been an eye opening experience to learn from this knowledge and then apply it to my life."
2,Isn't there more,"A superficial treatment of almost every subject. I found it of very little use. There are better books out there on every subject listed in the table of contents. The book just tries to cover way too much to be of any use on anything. I definitely do NOT recommend it, especially not to someone just getting started with livestock, or someone just thinking about it. You need to know SO much more."
3,"It is ""OK"" but not five stars.","I picked up some good information. I've been reading a few books of this nature and it was of less value to me when compaired to others that I've read. I guess that it sort of beat certain topics into the ground while just grazing others. I would chose a different book for how to build fences, but to each their own."
4,Adorable and Solid,"I love the new Hannspree Flora 12"" TV I bought for my bedroom. Adorable and unassuming, this TV blends in perfectly without overtaking my tiny bedroom. Nice picture, good sound, well made. I couldn't be happier."
5,The Cat Came Back in living color!,This is a book that not only is fun to read but the illustrations capture and hold your attention throughout. The colors are vibrant and the detail is whimsical and will make you smile. Each page is artwork you will want to frame.It is a keepsake for my kids!
5,Illustrations are Wonderful,Loved the book and thought the illustrations brought the story to life!-Liz Donroe-
4,"Bratz Diamond game fun, but too short",My seven year-old daughter absolutely loved this game--even more than the first one. The only problem is that she mastered it in one sitting.
3,Richard Simmons food mover vedio,"The food mover vedio is a lot of fun.I do not get to use it much,because I am so busy.But I am going to get back to it soon!"
2,Italian Job XBOX,"In my opinion, this game sucks. The way the cars handle in the in game are not very realistic and if you get TOUCHED by two police cars. You fail even if they don't have you boxed in. You hit head on with one police cars and before you can take off, a second cars comes up and hits you making you fail. What really sucks is that there is three sections per stage and you go back to the beginning of the stage even if you fail on the last section. They don't have anything where you can customize your car. If you want a racing game, buy need for speed. Don't waste your money on this game."
2,Does not work on XBOX 360,"Does not work on XBOX 360, too bad because I liked the game on the original XBOX. Some games work, this one does not."
4,Worth every dime....,"Martha Randolph Carr does a great job painting the relationships, scenery, and history of the people in this isolated island community.The story revolves around the second to the oldest of four sisters, who reluctantly returns home when her father falls ill and is due to die. It has turmoil, secrecy, love, history, and a little bit of every woman wrapped in these four women.For me, it shows how four people, raised in the same environment, can have completely different lives, personalities, and memories. It made me see into my own life and past.If you are looking for rape, murder, or any of the socially acceptable means of book selling today, this is not it. It's a chick-book... to be read on lazy Sundays when you don't want to get out of bed."
1,Drawn out and disrespectful tale of 4 sisters reunion,"These four sisters gather at the home of their dying father and attempt to confront their past as it relates to their present. It is told through the eyes of the self-absorbed second eldest daughter-Tollie. The sisters show a disrespect for themselves and their father which leads one to believe that the ""secret"" that is lying at the midst of this drama is deep and dark. The mediocre story line, peppered with dull dialogue brings us to a climax that is even more drab than the previous chapters. I could not bring myself to read the whole thing and kept skimming to get to the point, which I may add was raised in the dialogue more than once.As a member of a family with 4 sisters, I thought I would find some parallels and feeling of comraderie with the characters. I have a greater appreciation for my own sisters now. Even at our worst, we are not like these sisters at all.Don't bother."
4,Lots of detailed information,"This book shows how to implement almost every phase of the Pro 3-4 into your existing defense. Topics include: Strategic Adjustments; Defensive Stance, Alignment, Responsibilities, and Techniques for all defensive positions; Backfield Coverages; Blitz Packages; Defending Against Specific Offenses; and Developing a Defensive Game Plan. Lots of diagrams. Excellent book for coaches at any level."
4,Good book - tons of pictures,"This book is easy to read and has tons of pictures and charts which are easy to learn from. The downfall of this book is the actual written text. It is quite limited, in my opinion, and provides little information about the actual things you are diagnosing. On the other hand, the pics and the charts make diagnosis of said lesions easy. If your goal is to diagnose lesions, then this is your book. If your goal is to learn about the lesions and know how to treat them, then this is not your book."
4,Excellent CD,The CD that comes with this book is very handy while learning exams. I have not really used the book however because Bates seems to be the standard that most schools are using.
1,serious problems,been buying hdd's for about 15 years. this has been my worst experience ever. errors and delayed write right out of the box. Seagate RMA a real headache. my guess is they have offset the the cost of long warranty with garbage service on the warranty.
1,It Died,"My drive lasted 3 days before it quit. My computer wouldn't boot with the drive installed, and the drive made noises like the heads were searching for data on another drive."
1,Two defective units in 30 days!,"I had TWO of these die in the first 30 days! Both times, the drive would shut itself down with a ""clunk"" in the middle of writing something to the drive. Seagate technical support verified that the units were defective. I have found quite a few other people having the same problem with this particular unit on some of the tech support web sites. Although I have always been a Seagate fan (I used to build computer systems and always used Seagate drives), the quality control and/or engineering on this particular product is horrible.I returned the second one and purchased a Western Digital drive, which has been working perfectly.Don't take the chance with your data until they fix the problems with this model. Buy something else!"
2,Terrible Experience,I usually dont write reviews for stuff but this is just ridiculous. You can add me to the list of failed Seagate drives i have one with this exact PartNumber fail 9Y7274-557. I bought two 300gb drives one made in Thailand (the one that died) and one made in Singapore with a different Part Number. This drive in particular failed within 3 weeks of buying it new. It died for no apparent reason. The drive was installed but not in use (not writing at the time and had been briefly written on (25 gb of personal data was lost). The drive was being monitored for temperature and it was not overheating and had active cooling. The drive just stopped after the computer had been on an hour. After that it would not spin up again. I am now worried that the other drive might die any minute.. its almost full.. stupid Seagate...
4,interesting book,"This is a 218 page softcover book w/ color photographs. A map and glossary are included. Although there are photos from New Orleans, Toronto, New York, etc., the focus is primarily on the festivals (e.g., Carnaval and Jonkonnu) as found in the Caribbean. There is a lot of text and photos detailing everything from the ancient history all the way up to some very modern expressions of carnaval. Many extraordinary photos of costumed paraders."
1,Stopped working,This item worked for a while and then one day just stopped working. The mechanism is so simple that can't quite figure what caused it to stop working.
1,Dymo hand held label tape makers,Spend a few dollars extra and get the pink one (the one with two extra print wheels). It's a different product and is vastly superior to the Dymo Organizer Xpress Pro. I found the Xpress Pro to be an unsatisfactory piece of junk; several complaints but the most serious one is that the letters are spaced too far apart on the tape. The pink one works like the Dymo machines of old.
5,FIRST ONE AND I LOVE IT!,"this is the first product i buy to make labels and i have to say i love it! it's so easy to use and affordable! for someone who's going to use it a few times to make labels here and there it's perfect. it's also great for kids, my sister who is 9 learned to use it in a matter of seconds. the labels stick pretty well i didn't have a problem with it. will defiantly recommend!"
1,Buy something else,"Out of the box the thing never worked right: inconsistent spacing and alignment of characters, constant problems with the feed mechanism and cutter. Also, by design the characters are too far apart. Finally, after very infrequent use, it gave out entirely. Anybody got a recommendation for a label maker that works well but doesn't cost 20 or 30 bucks?"
3,"Great item, but very touchy","This is a great item...for the first month or two, then is starts backing up and printing over the same letter over and over again. Although it's great for a while,... i can't really recamend this item."
2,It doesn't work that well.,"This product took longer than expected to arrive. Then it worked well at first, but stopped working after a few times. I had to go online to see how to ""repair"" the glitch."
1,return for replacement or another brand.,this thing does not print at all and will not cut tape either. it is not what i expected at all.
2,Clunky,"Large, awkward to use, clunky and I would rather I find my 40 year old little gold colored chunkalong Dymo labelmaker again. It is totally hiding so I bought this. It's just plain yeukky. Cutter-off-er is not good, I can't blankspace on it, and it feels rinkydink, shoddy and just plain trashy to use. I end up having to try to peel the backing by scraping at a corner with my fingernails and it more gums it off than cuts it and the spacing on end of cut and start of next bit is just bad. If I hadn't ordered it online it would have gone back. It is relegated to the greenhouse to make pot labels for my various cuttings. Yes I bought it because I wanted raised/embossed labels not flatprint. Wish I wouldn't have bought it. It got two stars because it does work, just that I wish I wouldn't have bought it had I been able to try one first, and had this been my first Dymo product purchased it would have been my last."
5,Thyroid Disorders by Vaughn,"The author describes scans, ultrasound and biopsy techniques toaid in the detection of thyroid diseases. There is an extensivedescription of thyroid cancers and treatments. The lobectomy isa partial removal of the thyroid lobe. There are various internet sites devoted to thyroid issues; namely, healthscout.com, endocrineweb.com and thyroidabout.com. There is a thyroid foundation at thyroidfoundation.orgNew treatments are available for thyroid diseases i.e. Hypothyroidism may be treated with synthetic thyroid hormone.This book would be very valuable for anyone having thyroidhealth issues to address. It is well worth the price for a highly concentrated treatment of the thyroid gland."
1,"Look it's from IBM, so don't buy it.","It's made by IBM, what else needs to be said. Don't buy IBM if you want quality, or industry standards."
5,Exceptionally wonderful,"Hands down, one of Denzel Washington's best performances. An amazing sports movie and even better, an incredible true story. This movie is performed by a fantastic cast that overcomes trials and tribulations together, despite the pressures of racism at the time. Truly wonderful."
1,Wrong Region,I wish it would have said that the dvd wouldnt play on dvd players made in the U.S. a little more noticeable because i did not see it and now i'm down 7 bucks
5,"Exciting, Realistic, And Fun Alias Action","Alias fans unite in this fast-paced action game with real cast voices and awesome effects and graphics. I love Alias and this fun, challenging game. The digital Sydney is so good, it makes me dream of having Sydney walk off the screen and join me for drinks after the game."
3,"Action, Drama, What more can you ask?","Anyone who is a fan of the show, will like this game. How can you not? Its got all the of pulse pounding, nail biteing, costume changing suspense. I had to beat up Sark, drug him, put him in a wheelchair and wheel his ass out of a building full bad guys?! I was sweating bullets playing it. But you need a strategy guide to play it. There's no way you can complete the game without one."
3,WHAT IT IS,"As an artist, I used these to create Artist Trading Cards, even applying metal with this gluestick. I would recommend to a friend."
1,The dumbest game ever,The game was way to easy. I beat it within the first 15 min. I also played the one for the gamecube. I think if they made it the same for the game cube and the ds it wauld be way cooler.Fromsomeone who blew of a lot of money
5,great for the girls,usually my daughter beats a game in about a week and is then bored with it.this game has lasted more than a week and the sounds are so realistic.the price was great and the shipping was fast.
3,Bratz Diamondz Nintendo DS game,"Not what I expected, but my daughter likes it. It' fun, but could be better!"
2,Interesting...,"This game was kind of fun to play.Only that it was a little short.I beat it in one day.The price was a little too high too.I really don't want this game anymore,I could have bought something much better and the same price as this game."
2,BRATZ DS,I bought this for my 7 year old & she say's it's okay..I tried to play it & you can make the dog sit by saying sit but it doesn't respond.It's a okay game but I would not pay much for it.
4,Revo 64,"This is a very good club for the money. The first time i used it I cut three strokes off due to the fact I could get close to a tight pin locations. Allthough it feels a little heavy and the grooves could be deeper, This is a nice club for the money."
3,There is a reason to get this book,"On the whole, I don't like abridged books because I usually find, when I get to read an unabridged version, that the parts cut out have the kind of details I enjoy reading. I've had this for many years and I saved it for one reason: the illustrations. Most of them are very nice and worth having even if one has a complete copy of the books contained in it. I've read THE STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE and THE NINETY-AND-NINE only once (in my copy of this volume), but I read the others many times when I was young."
5,Another book I'll have to get on Jim Morrison & The Doors!,"I'm a big Doors fan and their music because I have ""The Best of The Doors"" CD anthology collection compilation. And this is a good way to overwiew and look at the poet, a bizarre cult status, a contemporary rock legend and called the lizard king of the mid sixties. For me I would buy it and read all about it!"
1,A biography of Jim Morrison?,"Why would anyone buy a biography of Jim Morrison by authors who write on page 465 (bottom of page):""Maybe what destroyed him was their refusal to let him set them free, or more likely, his realization that he had wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy.""The authors are making reference to the period of time when Jim Morrison was down and facing the thought of having to return to the Florida court system to once again face the trumped up charges that he faced in the Florida crimminal case launched against him.Jim Morrison ""wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy""? I think not. I think the authors ""wasted their time writing this book, and it is a waste of time to read this book"". Aloha. Peace."
3,No New Insights Into Jim Morrison and The Doors,"An OK book, but a lack of insight into what Morrison and The Doors were all about. In addtion, to reiterate what someone else said, there are numerous passages in this book that have been lifted verbatim or in slighty modified form from the work of others without attribution. Definitely not a good thing."
2,No Kewpie Doll . . .,"I am the same Tony Funches mentioned in various books regarding the time I spent working for/with The Doors. If Jim were alive and The Doors were still active, I would still gladly & happily continue the duties they all trusted me with. The only books I consider CLOSE to authentic are those written by the band members themselves. ALL THE OTHERS are interpretations of Cosmic Slop thought up by people who cannot really know how this stellar convergence of talent & intellect occurred. And that's OK! Um Tut Sut!"
2,Deja vu all over again,"This book touts itself as the definitive account of Jim Morrison's life and art but it's essentially a re-write of Jerry Hopkins' ""No One Here Gets Out Alive"". Really! Compare the two yourself: there are numerous passages in this book that are basically paraphrased from the original 1980 bio. I simply don't see much evidence of the authors' claimed extensive research. However, to give credit where it's due: some of the writing is evocative and downright excellent. For example, the passages on Morrison in Venice, CA when he first begins writing music or as he put it ""meeting the spirit of music"" put you right there in a genuinely moving manner. Also, the depiction of Morrison's last concert in New Orleans where that spirit abandons him is also striking."
4,"Not perfect, but better than most","As an author and Doors fan, I found this book both indispensable and regrettable...indispensable, entirely because of the authors' exhaustive coverage of the events concerning Morrison's death in Paris and the surviving Doors' attempts to continue without him during the early 70s (neither of these subjects were addressed by Doors/Morrison bios written prior to 1991, when this book was originally published), and regrettable because huge portions of the biography are either lifted verbatim from ""No One Here Gets Out Alive"" or are so poorly edited that easily caught typos and misnomers made it into the published work. A better solution would have been a smaller book focusing on the new information unearthed by the solid reporting of the authors, but even with the above caveats, ""Break On Through"" is a must-read for the serious Doors fan and interesting casual reading for any rock fan."
4,a lot of information,"if you want to to know alot of details about the doors this is the book. it doesn't seem to exagerate and it is well researched. it doesn't really go into depth about who the doors really were personality wise. it lacks character. but all the same, i would suggest that if you are a doors fan that you read this book, i would esp recomend it over ""No One Here Gets Out Alive."""
5,A GREAT BOOK!,"if you ever wanted to know anything about one of the most spirtaul and intelectual person to ever walk the earth, read this book. It goes deep in to morrisons head, and shows just how the doors were formed. a must read."
2,great fan with fatal flaws,"I bought this fan for one of my greenhouses. The variable speed settings and circular motion were great for simulating natural, gentle breeze patterns. But like others here, the fan has become a $70 piece of junk WAY TOO SOON (4 months!). Whenever the power goes out (in my old house, weekly), the fan must be reset manually. It doesn't just turn back on and remember what it was doing. The power went out this week, and now the fan no longer communicates with the remote which is the ONLY WAY TO MAKE IT TURN ON. I bought new batteries, cleaned the sending and receiving parts of the remote and fan, and nothing. It's a shame the features are so nice, and the controls are so poorly conceived."
1,lousy short-lived electronics,"Sure enough, as predicted in others' reviews, this fan quit working after 1 summer of light use. The electronic chip in the fan is cheap and very poorly made. It burned out quickly, and unless you have the electrical know-how to bypass the electronics and hook the motor directly to the cord, you have a useless fan."
4,Repeat buyer,This is the second Windchaser fan that I have purchased. The first one lasted about 6 years. My kids use them in their bedrooms for circulation and cooling every night. The timer is nice if they don't want them to run all night long.
1,Dont recomend,"I have this fan, there are mayor flaws, one is that most of the time is does not respond to the remote very unpredictable,is a lot a work for it to respond, if you have more than one, the remote may or may not work with all the fans is unpredictable, the other problem is that if you cant find the remote you cannotturn on the unit, if the communication problems was resolve puss if they can also allow the manual use of the unit, it would be a great piece, The 1st timeI learn of these fan was in costco.com, we both about 8 for our church, we needed the fans we suffer thru all is inconvenience that the only reason we don'treturn them but I don't recommend no one this kind of ordeal. Is a mayor pain."
2,Just OK,The features of the fan are nice on paper and it was easy to setup. I don't find it very powerful and the area it covers seems smaller than other fans I've owned. I would try a different product next time.
3,Brief & concise,"The entire book is actually a short read -- more like a magazine article -- which has just been spread out to several chapters. The pointers on how to raise your children to be readers are supported by reading material suggestions for each age/level. Most of these suggested materials are not available worldwide, but you do not have to limit yourself to these selections. Surely, there are similar materials in the market(s) where you are located."
2,"poor, poor quality","Ok, the songs by themselves are good...provided i'm listening to them on the ORIGINAL CD in which it was recorded. The recording quality is horrible. My speakers are almost all the way up and still it's at a quiet volume. At different points in the song, it will get a bit louder, then the sound goes back down to a whisper. So, if you're looking to score 3 CD's for the price of ONE good quality CD, please save your money...or just spend a little extra and buy the regular CD's themselves. If I didn't order it myself, I would've thought this was bought at a flea market. Oh yeah...that reminds me--also, some of the songs sound like the artists are singing into a box...too much echo. So not worth the money!!"
3,50 country songs,I down loaded onto my kindle fire i like it but to bad unless i have wi fi i cant here my songs wich defeats the purpose.
5,High energy and musical integrity,"These guys are extremely talented yet totally accessible to any kind of music lover (something that doesn't often happen). You won't know how to categorize them, but you'll know you like it. Buy the album and you'll know they sound great. See them live to find out that they rock!"
2,Very Old School,"I was excited by this release, I mean, you can always use another King and I recording, but it's just not worth the purchase. Everyone sounds like they're 85 years old with their warbaling vocals. It would be worth buying if ""Small House of Uncle Thomas"" had not already been released on the much superior London Revival and Jerome Robbins Broadway."
2,"Potentially Great, But Crashes and Freezes too often","I really think it is a shame when a game this good(probably the best RPG on the market)has to crash so much you want to quit playing it.This Xbox version of ""The Game of the Year"" edtion of Marrowind which is a sequel to the already out, ""Marrowind Elder Scrolls III"" game. It combines Marrowind with two other related games, making one really big game. To play it you already have to have the original game saved on your xbox.Unfortunately the ""Game of the Year edition"" was not put together right and is a sad sequel to maybe the best RPG game ever created because after the tenth time it crashes in an hour, you don't feel like wasting anymore of your day."
2,Hmmm... well,May i say that this is one of the most time consumeing games that isnt online....Well ive spent way too long on this game for what ive gotten in return.it ruined 3! of my games i started! and i can assure you that i have a fully functional xbox.this game glitches... gets really time consumeing in a bad way.... dumb story.... bad! graphics!i love elder scrolls 4: oblivion... but this game gives me the wiggins.my brother likes this game alot but me and him don't see eye to eye....in my opinion this is a bad game all around....
5,best rpg ever,This game is sick I love it you can be from a lizard to a human a thief to a wizard whatever you want and you can creat a bit of a personality and there are no bounderys I can just play for hours and hours I've played at leased 100 hours in the game and it will not get old I want more quests more people to kill I need more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Disappointed,"The game itself could have been one of my favorites, but the frequent crashes ruined any fun that I had. The loading time from saves is also long, which usually doesn't bother me, but combined with the crashes, it drove me insane.I thought some of the bugs would have been worked out since the game was re-released, but I was definitely wrong. I wonder if this is covered under the warranty."
2,Not my kind of RPG,I grew up playing RPGs starting with Dragon Warrior for Nintendo and most recently playing the much more action oriented WoW. This game just doesn't appeal to me. If I wanted to play a game that took as much work as this I'd just go get a second job.
5,What can I say,"This game just totally rocks in every way! You can go anywhere, whenever, and do whatever, whenever. It also has high replayability due to the myriad of factions and guilds you can join, and characters you can create. My only beef is the environments. The Imperial Legion towns were really awesome, but many of the Dunmer strongholds were too ""cookie cutter"" and I got really sick of Vivec. Everything got to looking the same after a while. It took me a long time to get through the Main Quest.I played as many different types of characters and joined many guilds but my hands down favorite is the Argonian, and I finally decided not to tempt fate and take sides. The Thieves Guild is really tough to master. Get the guide because you'll need it!"
4,Good Game,"It has been years ago since I played Arena on my PC. I loved that game and was heart broken when about half the way through the game my character got stuck in a wall in a dungeon (bringing tears to my eyes just thinking about it). I more less just gave up.Now that it has been years later I have gotten a XBOX and saw Elder Scrolls: Morrowind (Game of the Year). I was re-excited about the saga to be played again. I read the many great reviews here at Amazon and was a little weary on buying it due to lock ups that people have complained about. I went ahead and went for it! I was amazed of how much more stuff you could do than what I played in those Arena days. Yes the game does lock up from time to time, but I believe the game it self out weighs the lock up. I would have given it the full five stars if it weren't for the lock up issue. The loading time I can deal with. All and all I highly recommend it as a must have game for your XBOX collection."
5,a classic!,this wasn't chosen 'game of the year' for nothing..classic in-depth rpg.. you will become fully immersed in this one..(ghost)
2,"The correct title should be ""NARROWMIND""","I am not a fan of the slasher type games... you know, you kill one bad guy and it's pretty routine after that. I got this game because I thought it would be interesting and fascinating to play.... what was I thinking? The graphics on this game look great if this were 1990, but pale by comparision to the graphics of most other games on XBox, and don't even come close to Myst 4 on my Macintosh. The interactivity is truly dull, everyone asks you dumb questions like ""I am waiting"" and ""My patience is thin""... wow, you could get that kind of conversation at the supermarket line! I have played this nonsense for 2 hours and I will now use it as a coaster. Blech!"
1,This game sucks,"I spent hours upon hours of walking around in this game. Plus, the combat system was terrible. It took literally 10 tries to hit someone. The cities were way to large, and the maps were very confusing. Unless you want to spend HOURS walking around and jumping, pass this game up."
5,You HAVE to be an RPG person.,"Trust me-this will be no fun if you like game like the Punisher or whatever where you just kill things. There is some thinking involved. But this here is the epitome of RPGs, THE RPG, and if it crashes or freezes duh it is your Xbox's fault. I also highly recommed you buy the Strategy Guide."
4,Need old Xbox to play,"I don't know how the game is yet, I didn't have a Xbox to try it on. Tried it on my Xbox 360 and found out it doesn't run. I talked to Microsoft and they said that the normal Morrowind will run, but not the GOTY edition. So, before you order, make sure you have an Xbox 1. If not, you'll have to do like I did and order one :(."
5,Best RPG ever,"Unbelievable, worth every glitch and long load screen, the best RPG ever made, really. I put over 200 hours in to this game, it was just great fun, spent two days diving randomly for pearls in the clams in the water. Everything in the game is that detailed!"
5,Exellent Game I Loved It,This is one of the best games there is. For me it's tied with Baldur's Gate. They are both wonderful games and you should try them out.
4,the game never ends,"if you need to get away from life as we know it to a wourld of peace or death play this game. this is the best rpg iv ever played far better then ff10,2 and hears a tip bolmara is a grate city but aldrunn is better thats curently were my home is yes i actully have a house in the game its got tones of stuff in it and its a good place to lunge around in its a big home and i like that. any way hey 11-year old gamer i think u and i should be friends weve both got great tips on great games unlike u thoug i take this stuuf seroulsly look at halos review from me, anyhow here is another tip if u need to buy or sell something go to suran not vivec i absolutly hate vivec if even wanted dead there but the ordanators cant catch marcus my redgaurd 6 level assasian born under the thief and dont pick y when chosing classes cuse cances are youll end up a rouge no prblem"
4,Morrowinds game of the year review,This game is fund and challenging to someone that has never play this type game before. We have enjoyed it. The game arrived in excellent condition and plays like a new one.
2,buy this for the pc not the xbox!,"its an awesome game but as soon as you start to get into it and your game gets large, it starts freezing and giving you a dirty disk error message! it can really ruin a good game so dont waste your money on the xbox version and get the pc version."
5,For the smart people,"Hmmm... The guy near the bottom is an complete idiot for saying this game sucked... Maybe because he dosent know how to play different game other than lord of the rings (attack and kill... point of game. Thats it.) So dont listen to people like that guys. If youre a smart person, youll be able to actually play a game that isnt only based on one button. You can do what ever you want in this game, you dont HAVE to go on the main quest, really. Do what you want, when you want, how you want- As they say. By the way, im 14. =P"
5,from St Cloud MN,One serving is 1 TSB and is 15 calories from organic guava and natural citrus flavor. I like to take is under the tongue. The liquid vitamins enter into the system easier and quicker. You also get more of the mgs into your system. I also like to take this on an empty stomach for quicker absorption.
5,The Best DALLAS Season out of all others!,"Yee-haw! Season 7 represents the best of DALLAS on all levels -- acting, writing, background music and ""all of the above."" The show really hits its stride here, showcasing fun, inventive stories that breathe new life into the genre, while staying true to the series' roots and the characters' makeups. Unlike other soaps from the 80s, DALLAS could generate real emotion with its twists and turns and explore Pam and Bobby's divorce with real heart, drama and even a sense of humor when appropriate. Even this season's cliffhanger reinvented things for DALLAS, which had been trying to outdo the ""Who shot J.R.?"" cliffhanger for many seasons since that ""high."" Anyone who counts themselves as a fan of J.R. and company will definitely want to own Season 7. (And no, I don't have anything to do with the show or the company releasing this DVD -- this is a heartfelt opinon!)"
4,Dallas,It's great to relive the Eighties and to learn a few tricks from old JR! The DVD quality is a bit grainy but I suspect that's because the series is so old.
3,Starting to show some cracks...,"i have to disagree with some people on here. i'm about two-thirds through Season 7, and while the core characters remain solid - there are two secondary ones killing it for me: Peter and Katherine...i have no problem with a May-September romance. the issue is Christopher Atkins: he's just not a good actor. i find myself forwarding through some of his scenes. pretty much the same goes for Katherine Wentworth scenes. while Morgan Brittany is a decent actress, her character is pathetic. she isn't Bobby's first or second choice, he treats her like a casual friend at best - yet spends all her time chasing something she'll never have. she's nothing more than a weak female foil to J.R.Dallas, Season 7 probably rates closer to 3-1/2 stars, but it's the supporting cast that spoils the overall picture..."
4,dallas season 7,"Dallas season 7 is excellent,with JR and his sly deals,miss elly& clattons up and downs,bobby & pams new lovers,one being presilla presley & poor sue ellen with her stupid taste in men or should i saw boys. great veiwing bruce"
3,Dallas 7,Poor sound and picture quality; interrupted transmission and occasional blankouts.The buying price has been jacked up from the time the first of the series was purchased. The episodes cannot be downloaded for later viewing at places without Wi-Fi and it could be possible that you would lose the purchase if it is taken off Amazon's server for any reason.
2,beware about bad playing,"great series, finally all in dvd collection but beware about the following: season 5, 6, 7 and 8 are NOT in spanish, and some dvds do not play all the chapters. They just frezze at the midle of the chapter or sometimes at the very beggining. I only had seing up to the season 8, I hope the following seasons are going to be ok."
5,I love Dallas,Dallas was a great show and it's trely missed. I was too young to really enjoy it when it was on but I have the opportunity to view the entire seasons when I get a chance. Great show and wonderful plots.
5,Best of the Best,"For anyone who was a fan of the series, it is a fun trip back to Dallas in the 70s. The hair, the clothes, the tight jeans, it's all a hoot to watch. With J.R. in the mix, it's never boring. We own seasons 1-7 and hope to collect them all and watch them again 20 years from now."
5,"Richie""s review of Dallas Year 7",I have just finished watching Dallas Year 7 and am glad it resolved some of the problems from yaar 6. The episodes were excellent but now wonder when Year 8 will be out since I have been left in mid air wondering will Bobby survive being shot.
3,not one of my favorite seasons,"For me, this isn't one of the better seasons of ""Dallas"". I think it only goes down hill after this 1983-84 season. There's no need to give short episode summaries, since someone else already has. One of the first really bad continuing story lines occurred this season. I'm referring to the terrible, ill conceived romance between Peter and Sue Ellen. It might have been a little more tolerable if the producers had hired a good actor to play Peter, but instead they got Christopher Atkins.That brings me to the subject of another bad casting move, just to get a big name. The producers hired Priscilla Presley when they re-cast Jenna Wade. These two bad casting jobs are enough for me to pass on buying this season, though there are some good story lines."
4,Dallas: A Star,"Veiwing ""The Complete Seventh Season of Dallas"" will ignite your self-reflection on how to live life with true meaning."
1,Dallas Season 7 with wrong DVD Region Code,"I viewed the first six seasons of DALLAS and they are all fantastic, so I'd expect the same for season 7.However, the set of DVDs sent to me have the wrong Region Code embedded in them so they cannot be viewed on a DVD player that has the USA Region Code!Needless to say I was disappointed when I tried watching them.I contacted the seller (A and E Deals) but haven't heard back from them yet."
5,Dallas season 7 did not disappoint,Dallas season seven kept me on the edge of my seat. It was jammed pack full of drama. two thumbs up!!
5,Great Music,"A SUPER collection of music, real jazz form one of the master of the true sound!!! A great collection of music with some great vocals."
4,Excellent continuation of _Noble Privilege_,"This sequel to _Noble Privilege_ follows the same methods and has the same limitation to mostly secondary sources, and it continues Bush's very detailed study of the nuts and bolts of the noble order on the Continent. This time he's concerned with questions of diversity and mutability: Under what circumstances did the noble class grow or diminish, how did one enter the ranks of the aristocracy, how might one (or one's descendants) be de-nobled, what were the actual difference in station between those nobles who were wealthy and those who were not, and how did the latter dissimilarity affect personal conduct, choice of residence, and the necessity of trade? Again, the style is scholarly but quite accessible and the bibliography is very thorough."
5,Instructs and delights,"I'm late middle-aged, I'm an artist, and I raised a child fanatical about dinosaurs, so I know a little about them, too. ""Tyrannosaurus Rex"" had me grinning with pleasure, occasionally laughing out loud, and making mental notes about drawing and dinosaurs. I've sent this DVD to my friends' children for birthdays and Valentine's Day. And I've kept a copy for myself!"
2,"Poor Text, Good Examples and Pictures","The authors try to illustrate the materials as clearly as they can, they likely to speak the same things ""in other words"" to prevent the readers to misunderstand the contents; it is good, but they should write the text more simplify, do not use a lot of words and sentences to introduce the same idea. For example, they use one chaper to explan a simple formula, and through whole book, you can find many pages contains a lot of words, but just one or two sentences of them is the improtant notion you want to know. I suggest the authors should think about non-native readers, try to use little words to write the book. Do not speak one thing again and again, like gossip women.The advantages of this book is it contains many tables and pictures, it let users easy to undersatanding the materials."
3,good for calculations,But not so for coverage of computer architecture as a subject.Has good chapters on memory organization.
2,Perfectly confusing!,Too much information presented in a complicated format. It has it all but not a book to learn from. I don't recomend this to those who really want to understand the computer architecture and be able to design and calculate. Very difficult to understand and make sense of problems.
1,Horrible book,I have to say that this is the worst textbook I have ever used. It makes no sense! I would work on assigned problems from the book and I would spend more time trying to figure out what the question was asking for than I did actually working on the problem. And the text is no help when you are trying to figure out what to do as there are few if any examples. Frequently when trying to read their explanations of things I would find myself wondering what the heck they were talking about. I would not recommend this book for anyone who dislikes being confused and frustrated.
2,"comprehensive, but goes around in circles","Some chapters are easy to read, but some just don't have enough examples. I found myself stumped many times trying to attempt the exercises and finding the info that I was missing on the internet."
4,Good book,"The book I received is not hard-cover. But the book is really new, quite like a new book. So I will not choose to return it, and I like the book as a whole."
5,Excellent for scrapbooking!,Bought these for my son's back to school list but I used them at a scrapbooking party. Everyone had these elaborate tape guns. I loved these glue sticks. The project was finished quicker and my pages stick beautifully. Great when you don't want to make a mess!
1,Molded? Ew.,"We ordered a pack, and several of the glue sticks are molded. I have never seen glue that grows mold!Not to mention, this glue is very tacky - literally and it sticks to your fingers. I have to find a different brand that works better. Disappointed."
5,Works well,"This glue stick provides plenty of effective gluing in an easy-to-use way; when glue gets on the under-the-cap area it's easy to clean off with water, and back to business. My go-to glue."
1,Dissapointing,"Disappointing game. Saw this in a video store once and ever since then was searching for it. Amazon just happened to have a copy so I purchased it. Played it and the characters are quite amateurish - when they talk mouths do not move, movement is quite cumbersome, etc. You drive an 18-wheeler semi through the contryside in an attempt to gain favor with your mother who owns the trucking business. You can crash into buildings, cars, cop cars, motorcycle gangs. You do battle with these elements as well. Vehicle upgrades are available but the money that it takes to upgrade is incredible - the money you make on a delivery is soon gone just to buy gas. You can borrow money from a loan shark but the interest they want is also incredible so anything/everything you earn is quickly gone. Anyway, Amazon was the only place that had this game and I gave it a try. Disappointing game."
3,It freezes with ps2 slim,"It's a fun economy game with a lot of humor, but it's one of those in the small list that freezes on the ps2 slim. You can still play it but need to save every 5 to 10 minutes before it freezes again. That takes the fun away."
4,BiG mUtha TrUckers,Big Mutha Truckers is a great Game you can pick one of four players and they each have different trucks. The idea of the game is to beat 3 of your family members in 60 days to get to own your familys buissness. You have to stop at differnt countys in the game and you go to the store to sell and buy items to make money and give it to your (ma) . Although this game is not that much fun withouht the cheats you still should buy it because i'll give you the master cheat (the one cheat tht turns on everyting. It is CHEATINGMUTHATRUCKERS Well try the game for yourself and have a good time. Bye
5,TRUCKS,"THIS is a game of trucks. I like that there is a timer but not on every thing. The 60 days is very cool. The pics on this game are very good. I like the way that bad peaple like to steal your Truck. I would say that, this is a great game so why dont you go and get it! ! !"
3,OK product,"I use flash cards for my 3+ year old son regularly to increase his recognition, memory etc and understand how to read. These cards are good, but they are not really thick. What I mean by that is do not let the kids handle them because they will soon be crumpled and a waste. My 1.5 year son liked it initially but after a month he was very uninterested. meanwhile he still likes the Brainy baby cards that were big and with words and pictures. This is just with words, and you can also teach them colors."
1,Arrived DOA - Never Got A Replacement,"When I bought this item, it was being sold by Cmple. This item did not work. I tried it with an external HDD, GPS, and Blackberry. I packaged it up nicely, wrote a note explaining what was wrong, included the receipt, and sent it first class in a padded envelope to the address given for returns.That was the last I saw of it. Never heard back, never got a replacement. Lost in the mail? Perhaps, but not likely. I'm out about $5 which isn't too bad, but I will never order from this seller again."
1,Broke,Received it...it was broke (doesn't work)...too much trouble to return...note to vendor: make sure your stuff works before you send it to me. You lost a customer for life.
3,It Could Work,"USB cables are actually quirky cables. Depending on the quality, they work well for some applications but fail miserably for others. If you use this cable for printers and most MP3 players, you will probably have no problems.But use it for a universal card reader, digital camera, digital camcorder, or hard drive and you may be disappointed. At best, your device may occasionally dismount/disconnect. At worst, your computer may not properly recognize or connect to your device. This is when you'd have to spend a few extra bucks for some really premium USB cables."
5,Works with Garmin nuvi 200 GPS,"I bought this for my Garmin nuvi 200 GPS. This is the right cable. It fits the back and plugs into computers to download new voices and vehicles. It works well and saves a bundle on ""brand name"" usb cables. I highly recommend it."
3,"Cable is decent, but it is only USB 1.1- IT IS NOT USB 2.0","I bought this cable for an external hard drive, when i discovered the cable is a USB 1.1 cable and not USB 2.0 (I needed 2.0). Please be advised before purchasing one of these that they are USB 1.1 and NOT USB 2.0. Don't make the same mistake that i made (DON'T BUY IF YOU NEED THE CABLE TO BE USB2.0)."
5,It is what it says,I bought this cable to give a little more freedom as I use my Nikon D90 tethered to my laptop. It seems to be a good quality cable. I have since purchase this:AmazonBasics USB 2.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension Cable (9.8 Feet / 3.0 Meters)to give myself even more room to roam. It too seems to be a good product.
3,USB A Make to Mini 5 Pin Make Cable,"This product does not fulfill my purpose. I bought this cable to connect this to my WD passport hard drive. But, somehow it never connected as it was not getting enough connection. However, this used to connect to other devices without any problem. But, I could not able to make full use of this cable."
1,Loose fit in every device,This cable(mini USB connector)remained loose fit in every device i used. The moment you just shake the device even slightly the connection would get lost with pc or watsoever. I didn't like it although material seemed to be OK but functionality was not good enough.
1,Never let a friend or family member near this book,"This book started out looking very promising. It appeared as if it would answer the need for a good book for friends and family members. However, as I continued to read, I became very upset, as there was a distinct intimation that there is a strong psychological etiology to FMS, and that if the patient would just get on with life, everything would be fine. I refused to place a copy of it in our support group library. I felt betrayed by it's attitude."
2,Don't waste your money,"If you are looking for a book to explain Fibromyalgia to yourfamily and friends please don't look for it here. There are a fewpages that make mention of Fibromyalgia. The rest of the 55 pages here are filled with information that you can get from a any self help book. For instance: ""Using I messages is effective, because"" etc. Page 33. I sure don't intend to waste the time of my family and friends by suggesting they read it.Your family and friends who are interested in helping you would be better served to send or call for the information provided free from the National Arthritis Foundation."
3,Ok for the price,"I've had this watch for 7 years now and overall it is decent. The straps do not last long especially when they get wet frequently. I've gone through 3 or 4 bands already. Battery is still fine. The compass frequently loses its calibration and requires you to pull the cover off the back to do a reset of the watch. But when it is working, it works well, even underwater."
4,Great Watch,"Watch is really great, as most Timex watches are. The compass feature can be a little challenging to set-up. Watch band is ugly."
4,"Decent, but not great","I like this watch, the strap and body look nice, and it performs well too. The indiglo display is bright and easy to toggle with the large button at the base of the face, but it doesn't stay on after releasing the button: you must hold the button down to continuously light the background. Not great, but I would've liked a one second delay.The compass feature is why I bought this particular model, but after using it a few times, I didn't really continue to use this feature. As the manual states, sometimes the compass needs to be reset, and it seems like whenever I took the subway (I live in Tokyo, Japan), or was in a large building, the compass would get screwy.Despite these caveats, I think its definately more than decent, just not incredible. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Great value for the money,All features work as advertised. Extremely light construction. The alarm could have been louder. All in all a decent everyday watch.
3,OK for the price,"This is my second Expedition compass watch. I liked the first but when the molded band broke and the only replacement was 13 British pound from London, I chose this Expedition for the features and the replacable band. This one has smaller numbers and is more difficult to read the time with the indiglo but it is still better than the competition for the price."
5,Great Watch,"I owned this watch for probably 8 years. This summer I left it on the bumper of my trunk after riding dirt bikes and lost it! I loved this watch, used the digital compass often while hunting. I wore this watch riding and racing dirt bikes also. Indiglo feature worked great. I believe I had 3 bands on it over the years. I like a rubber style band for this type of watch but could never find one that if it fit looked right. The only complain I have is its a little hard on the battery. Seems I changed it out about once every 18 months. Now I have to decide do I buy this one again or the newer model expedition T49612. Still havent decided."
2,A watch is a watch is a....,"watch if that's all it does. I've calibrated mine 3-4 times and I still only get a ""close"" direction 1 out of 4-5 times. I recently had it on a multi-night backpacking trip at different elevations and directions and it was almost always 30-45 degrees off my good compass. I would never depend on a watch compass anyway for critical direction finding, but it'd be nice if it were at least within 5-deg of actual. The other watch functions are a little better than average and the night light was great for those dark nights in the woods. I realize that this is approx. 1/8 the price of a good Suunto, but don't say it has a compass function that is usable."
2,Good for one year,"I used this watch for 3 months and was very satisfied with it.Battery was dead after about 1 year. So thinking that I would start wearing it again I replaced the battery to find out the digital compass did not work anymore. I called Timex for some tips on what could be wrong, they said I could send it in and they would replace it and charge me half the retail price.I could buy one off the internet for that price so I didn't feel that that was a great offer."
1,Useless compass,"I purchased this watch for the compass feature, but found it to be completely useless. Apparently, the compass electronics were OEMed from the Tate Compass Company (you surely remember their famous motto: ""He who has a Tate's is lost""). The compass quickly loses all sense of direction shortly after calibration. The only redeeming virtue of the compass is that the errors are so large that you would never depend on the thing.This watch also has user interface and functionality problems, but they aren't worth discussing, giving the basic lack of functionality."
3,"A compass, but not a great one","I bought this watch as a backup in case my real compass is lost or broken in the woods. It seems that this watch/compass needs to be recalibrated with every use, which is fine, but don't forget to do it, or you can be well off on the readings."
1,God Awful,"Wow! Really lame watch. I got it for the compass feature. This was cool for a few days until I realized that it was simply NEVER accurate. It's so invaluably cool to have a navigational compass on a watch, but this was bogus. never accurate. The other features worked swell, but I've discovered I just like Analog watches more in the first place!"
1,Compass doesn't function under water,"Nice watch but totally useless if you want to use the compass under water. You have to keep pushing one of the buttons continually or else the compass will blank out to save battery life. Nowhere in the advertising does it say ""don't push the buttons underwater"". Once you get it the manual says ""don't push the buttons underwater."" Why in the world would Timex boast that the watch is water resistant to 100 meters if you can't access all the functions? You can't even set it to compass mode and have it stay there for any length of time. Typical sleazy advertising on Timex's part in my opinion. I'm taking the watch diving next week and I will push buttons underwater. If the watch fails, it goes into the trash. This is the absolute last Timex product I will ever buy."
2,buy the casio instead if you want a compass,"The compass is worthless. The rest of the watch is fine. I have also owned the casio compass watch, where the compass feature worked great. Buy the casio instead if you want a compass watch."
4,very good compass watch,"I have had this watch for over 3 years and all functions work fine.I did change the battery once a year ago, which is not easy to do without the right tiny tools. There is a spring clip which holds the battery in and must be released to remove the battery. Also, I have had trouble finding the CR1620 battery at local stores, but you can get it online. Last summer the watch suddenly reset itself to 1/1/00 several times for no apparent reason, but this has not happened again. I suspect the humidity got to it a bit. The compass is accurate and not hard to calibrate. If you like this watch, I suggest comparing it to the LaCrosse XG20 compass watch which is more stylish and perhaps more functional at about the same price."
3,Great watch but battery died too soon,"I used it for about 10 months before the battery died. While it was working it was five stars - nice looks, feels good on your wrist and easy night glow button. I especially appreciated having the compass feature. I tested it in northern, southern hemispheres as well as right on the equator and it proved itself to be very accurate. What impressed me the most was that I didn't even have to calibrate it as recommended.What was not so nice was that after 10 month of intensive usage (including alarm and night light on to remind ourselves to feed the newlyborn) the battery gave out. We went in to two nearby jewellers to have the battery replaced. Helaas, they couldn't do it because the battery replacement process was too hard. I listed it on eBay for parts then."
3,Not up to par,"There are a number of Timex watches that are far more intuitive to use. These other newer watches don't require directions for use. As an example, the 77862 has no reset feature for the Timer. What? I can't reset it? That's correct! To get it back to 1 minute, you have to manually toggle through the minutes up to 99 minutes in order to get it back to 1 minute. Stupid, huh?The indiglo light should stay on for 3 seconds when ever the indiglo button is pressed, but again this is not the case. You must hold this button down in order to keep the light on. Other Timex watches have the 3-second On feature but not this one. Ok, how about having plus and minus buttons for setting stuff. Nope, not this model, but other Timex models have this feature. And, this is a very nice feature on other Timex watches.Not to say I hate this watch, but I'm getting there. It is very accurate and the band is far more comfortable then the rubber/plastic types."
3,Not as good looking as the earlier model,"I previously owed a timex expedition compass watch. It stopped working after many years of good service. This looked like it in the picture when I ordered. Whem I received it, I was disappointed that it did not look as good as I thought I was getting. It's more cheap looking. I can't argue about the price. It was cheaper then other compass watches. It works okay, but just not as good looking as the previous one I had"
3,Not like previous ones,"I have owned a number of these Timex watches over the years and really liked them. Got this one and instead of metal it was plastic. This makes lighter (which is nice), but we'll see if it holds up over time. The Indiglo light is not as bright as the older styles. I still think it is confusing how to set the different features, but don't think this is unique to Timex on a digital watch. I need to keep a copy of the directions around to set the alarm."
4,"Great, but...","...for being a watch for active people, the band is a bit clumsy to take on and off. .. .."
4,Held up well,"so far so good - the compass takes some playing with to get accurate, the timekeeping perfect.it has been durable"
1,older model,"I had this model for about 7 years until the battery quit. I got a new one which was a new model with bigger, clearer figures. When that one quit after 7 years I ordered one of these, thinking it would be the new style. It wasn't so I returned it and found another new style one and ordered that. It works fine. - The Professor"
1,Too expensive to be disposable,"Don't buy this watch unless you plan on throwing it away when the battery dies. Timex will act like they're doing you a favor to replace the battery for you for half the price of the watch plus $7 for shipping. Since I've already bought the battery, I could have just bought a new watch for the same price. Good luck trying to find any support online from Timex (or anyone else) to do it yourself. Maybe I broke something when I disassembled it to get the new battery in, but I finally got the battery in and the watch reassembled and it still isn't running. Why in the world would anyone design a watch that way?The compass never worked well. At best it would be within 10 or 15 degrees, but quite often it was off by 180. (Yes, I calibrated it and set the declination.) The stopwatch was annoying to reset - by the time you've held the button long enough, the next race has started.After this watch, I'm not going to throw away my money with Timex anymore."
3,"Everything works, plan on getting another band.","All features work very well. Compass really works great once you get used to how to approach using it. The band itself is a crime. Due to the material it's made from it is VERY difficullt to buckle (and unbuckle). Knocked two stars off just for the band. Yes, it's that bad..."
2,"abysmal battery life, poor ease of use","Theoretically, this would be a winner. When operating, it's a fine watch and the compass is OK.The price paid was simply not worth about a year of use until the battery died. The blue on black button labels are unreadable, making this impossible to use without other instructions. I had to visit the Timex web site to get needed information."
3,timex watch,"The watch is my 2nd or 3rd,I can't remember.All the others of this same name and specification were great,but eventually died a natural death,I guess. This one function fine except the alarm and ""beep"" on the hour is not loud enough.Other than that,I like the watch."
4,Overdoing it!,"This game is preety good has gang members pushing shoving and netbreakers. I loved street vol. 2, and NFL Street, but this overdoing it. Next thing you know they're probly going to make kick the can Street. They're some good thing though about this game. You can start off with the gang shakedown, honeys, or skaterboys. You go up to the top gang STREET BALLERS. They're basketball players that play Street SOCCER? You can also pick up objects and through them at people. This game is rated T for strong language."
3,A beautiful picture book,"This book is full of color illustrations derived from photos, which are often bigger than life size. Often the page is full of images of the same fish shot from different angles. Even the common goldfish is shown nicely. It is a good picture book for young children and armchair hobbyists. People who want to set up an aquarium should not buy this book."
3,Colville at a glance,"I had hoped there would be more photographs of Colville's work in this book. I also would have liked to see the paintings that were referenced next to the text written about them. I found myself flipping back and forth through pages to find the photograph of a painting I had just read about.I got the impression that the author was afraid of being critical at all and relied on criticism written by others. I also learned what an important man Alex Colville is to Canada (both from his point-of-veiw, taken from interviews, and the authors glowing praise.) I found his personal insights and beliefs about art refreshing and a little intimidating. I enjoyed the different sections in the book that examined the influences literature, art history, and location have on his paintings. I think this book is a fairly good overview of the man, but not of his work."
4,Practical Math Formulas For the Mathematically Challenged,"I purchased this book for my son who is going to PSU for a construction management degree. He was very impressed with the logical explanation of the formulas and the diagrammed breakdown of each formula throughout the book, said he wished he had the book during his most recent Trig class."
5,"If you're in the trades, you need this book","This book can be a real life saver. It can be used as a general math book, but it really shines in answering questions and problems that crop up with great frequency in the building trades, that schools just don't teach anymore. It's amazing how many people show up on a jobsite, and really don't have the math skills needed to solve problems quickly, and get the job done. It provides real practical solutions, and unlike any other math book I've used, shows HOW to arrive at the correct answer without using a calculator.Excellent publication. I have one in the truck at all times, and anyone that works with me that's coming up in the trades can count on getting one.I would recommend getting this as a reference, and also get the Practical Math Application Guide along with it. There won't be any problem you can't solve!"
3,The practical math dictionary is really small,The practical math dictionary is really small. It is a 6 x 7 1/2 book. The picture makes it look like an 8 1/2 x 11. The print is very small. Other than these deceptions the book looks like a good one to read and to have.
3,Great water gun...if it works,"We bought 10 of these for my son's 5th birthday party as the ""goodie bag"" for each guest. As expected, we had a water battle royale to wind up the party. What wasn't expected was for three of the guns to break during reloading. In all three cases, the pump mechanism pulled off or split. We were able to jury-rig two of them to keep them operational, but it doesn't speak very highly for this toy's durability. On the positive side, the soakers were very easy for the kids to use, and held enough water to keep them busy squirting one another, rather than us constantly refilling.BTW, I noticed a review on this soaker (might have been a different color) that questioned why it takes batteries. Not sure what the reviewer was thinking of, but these soakers do not take batteries."
2,Cheaply Made,Have had this gun for two years and used it infrequently. Although it still works some of the parts are becoming unglued and falling off. The kids have to be careful not to pull the pumping lever to far out since it can easily be disconnected from the gun although it does go back in fairly easily. It does not shoot as far as other water guns we have used.
4,Great machine,This machine really does its job. Great result. We love cappuccino. But it's a bit diificult to work the machine. So far we're happy with this model.
2,I was dissapointed,"I had to return this machine, unfortunately. It was disappointing that clogged after every brew, and you had to take the machine totally apart and clean it. Also, the grind of the espresso had to be very course or else it would not go through the filter."
1,UNRELIABLE!!,"I bought this machine thinking it would save the time and mess of measuring, tamping and getting coffee grounds everywhere. It does that, but it broke after only 2 months and I had to return it. It feels cheap, it looks cheap and is poorly made for a product at this price level. BOTTOM LINE: Good espresso takes time and just go out and buy a good machine (w/ minimum 15 bar pump)..."
1,Capuccino capresso,"I think this coffee maker sucks!I had higher expectations regarding this capuccino machine. This one is good but it has a system you need to learn before you can easily use it on a daily basis. For example, after watching the instructional video, they do not give you all the details necessary to maneuver the machine. This week, I cleaned the machine and wanted to make coffee, something was not working and I had to leave to work without a cup of coffee after using it for a month. This machine can be very mysterious! ALso, I do not like the fact that you cannot control how strong the coffee will be, you can only turn it off sooner to make the coffee stronger. After 3 months of use, I feel like I want to return this coffee maker, I do not like it! People who wrote nice reviews probably do not use it in a regular basis. I think this sucks!"
1,Great coffe for few months,"We bought this machine and the grinder from amazon few month ago. It makes great espresso with excellent taste. We enjoyed it for few month before it broke. It started leaking coffee during brewing process. There is a rubber ring that is supposed to keep the pressure. That rubber is of very bad quality, it enlarged and it doesn't fit well anymore. Because there is not enough pressure during brewing all good coffee leaks into the sink area and we get some crapy tasting liquid in the cups.This machine is just a waste of money. I was looking online to buy and replace that rubber that leaks, but I coudn't find specific one for this model. I've read reviews that Capresso does not sell gasket parts separatelly and there is nothing else you can do with this machine except throw it away."
4,Very Pleased,"I had the machine for about five months and am very pleased with it. I found the instructions for use poor, which resulted in a bit of wasted coffee, but once I figured out the type of grind (not too fine)and the amount (not too much) the machine likes, I get very good coffee consistently."
3,Frother broken on arrival,"On setting up the ultima, it became apparent that the frother on our machine doesn't work.On the plus side, it's easy to reach Capresso technical support. We're sending it to the manufacturer for repairs, and they're paying for both repairs and round-trip shipping."
2,Great when it works!,"When this machine works, it produces good coffee and cappuccino. It is fairly easy to use and clean. However, too frequently it simply does not work. You put the coffee in, turn on the pump and voila...nothing happens. Rather than the water dripping through the coffee and into your cup, it ends up in the waste tray. Sometimes it works ok and other times I can try 3 or 4 times in a row without it producing a single cup of coffee. This problem also requires you to clean out the machine frequently because the waste tray quickly fills up with grounds and liquid. When the machine is functioning properly, only the spent grounds should end up in the waste tray. It is basically worthless and i will be returning it."
1,Not worth it.,"This machine is a clunky, poorly built, waste of money. I've owned it for about a year and a half and am desperately in search of a new machine. The ""semi automatic"" tamper works only about half the time. The other times it allows the fresh brew to dump into the waste box. The gear on the top rusts after about 6 months or so, causing constant scraping and cleaning to be required. Additionally, the frothing arm is WAY too short to work in a reasonable size frothing cup, and it only heats (to 160 deg.) one cup (8 oz.) of milk at a time; and only AFTER you brew coffee - so forget about making hot chocolate.I have tried to make this machine work well and 'tweak' how I make coffee to have minimal hassle, but this machine is flatly too poorly designed to work well constantly. Don't waste your money."
5,Easy to use,"I've had this about a month. It's very easy to use and makes good espresso without a lot of work. It has replaced our coffee pot and it's convenient enough that I haven't really found it a bother to make several double espresso's (for the family) every morning. I have to clean out the grounds bin every other day or so and the whole thing about once a week. The steamer works well although it does spit out a fair amount of water when starting up. We did find that if you don't take the end off the steamer and clean it at least every other week that you lose frothing power. That doesn't seem excessive given the amount of milk we are steaming. Overall, for reasonable quality espresso without a lot of fuss it seems like a great product."
1,Arrived broken,"The item arrived broken, with a cracked casing. Returned it - may buy another or may buy a different brand. Seemed a little flimsy."
4,Great cappuccino machine for home,"If you want a no-fail cappuccino machine - this is the machine for you. You won't get the richest coffee and the frothiest milk (although you can get pretty close) but you are going to get rid of the hassle which is more important in a machine used over and over throughout the day for you and all your family members + guests.Be careful not to fill up the machine with too much coffee, or it will be brewed straight into the bin... We've wasted a lot of coffee this way...Make sure you buy a milk pitcher along with the machine. It will come in handy.Rattleware 12-Ounce Latte Art PitcherAltogether it's a great machine, easy to use and more importantly - EASY TO MAINTAIN. I'll recommend it to my friends..."
4,A decent machine that works well,"This machine does exactly what it says it does; makes shots and contains the mess to an internal container that is easy to dump out. We like to clean the machine every day, which takes between ten and fifteen minutes. Right after we make coffee, we run hot water through the steam spout and the espresso maker to clean the lines. Then we rinse off the top, wipe the excess beans into the container, and wash the other parts.We have one complaint; after a week or two, the steam arm only works in the closed position. It spits water and steam out the wrong end of the tube in the open position, burning and drenching a small area around it. Luckily, we just like lattes, and the closed position heats milk and creates a lot of foam.We like it because we're unlikely to spend $800 on an automatic, and the thought of finely ground espresso all over my kitchen makes my skin crawl."
3,good in the begining...,ive had this machine for 3 years... the first one i got had a defective frother and they sent me a new machine.. then it worked pretty well until the frother died on me again and it was no longer covered under warranty. so i had to buy a stand alone frother. then recently the turning mechanism broke on me.. it just popped right off and its about 100 dollars to fix.. im replacing it with a nespresso machine.but during the time the espresso machine was working it tasted great.
5,10 CAPPUCCINOS PER DAY SINCE DAY 1,"I bought this cappuccino machine for my Wife for Christmas after returning from our first trip to Italy. She read the instructions and started making her first cappuccino in about 30 minutes. We have been using it now for about six weeks with only two tricks to learn and no significant problems. First trick -- grind matters. I bought the Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder for her as well. It is easy to use and has a variable grind that you can tune to the instructions given in the machine manual. We tried using ground coffee that was made for expresso but it did not work as well as fresh ground from beans. Second trick -- keep the frother nozzle clean by wiping it after each use and then running it for a few seconds into the air to push clean steam through the nozzle vents. Otherwise, milk will build up and block the vents. The cappuccino maker and grinder are both working very well and have already paid for themselves."
5,We make the best espresso in town with this machine,"You can call us espresso afficcionados, although not the type who would spend a thousand dollars on a machine. None of the restaurants and cafes in Hoboken (which is very near NYC and has plenty yuppies) make as good espresso as our Capresso Ultima. We've had this machine 4 years! We've contacted customer service once and they sent us a replacement o-ring immediately but I didn't need it, just had to clean the machine a bit better. It's so easy to use, clean and maintain. I've owned a few machines along the way, but this one beats them all hands down. You really can't go wrong, as long as you get a (Capresso) burr grinder or good quality espresso coffee."
2,"I love this machine, no wait I hate this machine","The first brand-new machine did not froth, so Amazon sent a replacement and that one worked for a while. I have owned this machine for 18 months and have made probably over 1,000 shots. It's a great machine, brilliant rotating eject system with built in tamper. Very convenient. 2 months ago, it started leaking from the bottom onto the counter tops and in addition, the primary gasket failed. Fair enough, things happen. I call Capresso, they say a repair -all in- inclusive of shipping is $80, also reasonable. It's really a swap with a re-furb, you do not get your original machine back.The repair comes in -- frother doesn't work. I call them back and they replace again. Guess what? Frother doesn't work, again!I like the machine a lot, but no one should have to deal with a 75% out-of-the-box defect rate and a major failure after 18 months. The product is nicely designed, but poorly built and has very poor repair quality control.I can not recommend it."
2,Weak coffee,"I read all the positive reviews here, and purchased Capresso. I am disapointed. The best feature is the ease of use, automatic disposal after brewing, and a large water tank. Unfortunately, there is no way to make a strong coffee in any quantity in this machine. It only takes a scoop and a half of coffee, and a scoop is barely bigger than a teaspoon. Try to put more, and the lever will not close, or worse, open mid-brewing, dumping your coffee inside the machine. I tried several kinds of coffee and several levels of gounding...no real results. I can make better expresso in my old 4 bar steam machine. My Capresso is going back."
2,"Good coffee, but extremely unreliable, too flimbsy","Makes great coffee and is easy to clean between cups, but hard to clean thoroughly. Over time, it started to smell and needed thourough cleaning. When it works, it makes very good coffee... I think they should have used a higher quality plastic...Biggest gripe is that it is a pain to clean thouroughly. I replaced this unreliable item with a Gaggia, no comparrison between the two coffee makers, the Gaggia is great compaired to the Capresso, though the Gaggia is not automatic the cleanup time more than makes up the difference."
2,A big disappointment,"We looked forward to this machine after reading so many glowing reviews. However, it has not lived up to our expectations. There are so many things that have to be JUST right in order to get a good cup of espresso--the right grind of coffee, the right placement of the tamping lever, the water temperature, etc. Only about every fourth try results in good espresso. If you don't put the tamping lever just right, NO coffee comes out at all. That means a lot of wasted coffee!! The instruction booklet is useless to help with any problems. If we hadn't thrown away the box, we would have returned it immediately!!"
4,Great machine,"I cannot review the reliability, only had it a week. But I LOVE the machine. Makes great espresso, easy to use, clean up is a snap, makes a good cup of 'creme coffee', froths good.I was concerned that it would be complicated to use but it simple to operate. It also works pretty fast.The only down side is that I cannot grind my beans to fine of really slows down the brewing and puts a lot of water into the overflow/used grounds area."
3,Lukewarm Espresso,"I love this machine. I tried every possible way to get it to make hotter espresso, but could not. I called support, but they were not able to help. BTW, I worked at a coffee shop during my undergrad and a I own one of those cheap small Krups espresso machine at home that produces espresso a lot hotter than this machine. Sadly, I have to return this machine."
2,Cheaply made product,"Well, like others here, I really wanted to like this product. And like so many espresso machine buyers, I came back from Italy with hopes of brewing the perfect espresso. I ordered this machine with high hopes for Valentine's Day and although it arrived right on time (thanks Amazon) the pump did not function and I spent a half a day trying to figure out if it was me or the darn machine - I called customer service from Capresso and they were very eager to help me, ultimately telling me they'd send a new body right away. However, the next day they called again and let me know it'd be early March before they could ship out the part. So, I returned it to Amazon and ordered a new one, it also came rush order (Thanks again, Amazon), and this one would not switch from steam to coffee - it was stuck on hot water. I believe this product is just too cheaply made, which is just too bad - this company is supposed to be Swiss, but this machine was made in China. I give up - [...]"
3,"Good, not great",This machine is low maintenance and produces good coffee. If you like strong coffee - not for you. If you like really hot coffee - not for you. The convenience of making a good cup is worth the other parts lacking. I have tried to my starbucks ground coffee fine to get it stronger and it is hit/miss. No doubt worth the money especially if you need and easy way to make expresso.
4,Song Traveler,"This is actually the second time I have purchased this CD. My CD's were stolen from my car, and I so enjoy Jon's songs that I bought it again."
4,"Prior reviewer, too critical","Had you listened to this album without knowing who they were, you would sit up, notice and ask who the performers were.I just wanted to react to the previous reviewer and counterbalance his claims. The album does not merit two stars only. The arrangements are lush and the supporting crew are exceptional. Overall it was a good performance. It may not be as groundbreaking compared to his previous work but it is still good nonetheless."
2,His sidemen are excellent; tunes are good; he sounds awful,"Hubbard is barely audible, his tone is terrible, he sounds tremendously stilted. It is a shame because the sidemen are so powerful and the tunes (covers of originals and the originals) are so well conceived (and executed by the sidemen) that this could be a great album. Hubbard truly sounds awful. I hate to say this about a trumpet player I love so much but a consumer should not be misled by Freddie's reputation (which definitely precedes him in this session). I don't know how the ""Jazziz"" reviewer can honestly declare that Freddie's trumpet shines. This was a major disappointment, particularly given the theme of the project."
4,Great alternative to expensive lenses,"Got this for my SOny HDR CX130, it screwed on right outta the box, and the image quality looks great in HD. The circle is not as wide as the screen when zoomed all the way back (get what you pay for) but you can just zoom in a little bit and get just the blackness in the corners, or zoom a little more and have no blackness at all. There are many better fisheye lenses in the world, but not for $30."
2,CRY BABY,"Don't let the cover art fool you...this is NOT a horror movie, it borders on being a HORRIBLE movie instead. A psychological drama is more like it, with a dark look at post partem depression, guilt, and denial. Lukas Haas plays a young father who moves his wife and infant son to a rural house to help her get over her PPD. His only neighbor is a ditzy woman who isnt the least bit interested in being neighborly, but has a dark secret of her own.While the ingredients could have made for a compelling movie, Tim Browns direction is so lethargic nothing ever really gels or creates true terror. Most of the movie is spent in checking to see if the baby is alive or not crying. Haas is weak in a difficult role while Emily Hampshire's performance as the wife is monotonous; Amanda Smith as the strange neighbor gives an adequate performance. Not really suspenseful and mostly just dull and tedious."
3,Super creepy,This movie was super creepy! I had to watch it a few times to understand it. My brother puked when the mom was rockin the cradle. The rest of my family couldn't finish the movie because it was so eery. I like movies that are on the lines of psychological horror. The director made a flawless blend between reality and psychological illusion and denial.
4,"Good Watch, not Great Watch","The fit and style are excellent as well as the backlight. However, the stopwatch is really weird. It only counts by whole seconds and stops at 59:59. As long as you have no significant use for the stopwatch, it gets 5 stars."
1,No luck with this one!,"I would not recommend this coffeemaker at all. I had one for two years and just threw it out. First, the LCD display went bad so that you could not read the time. I set the timer by waiting until the time I wanted it to come on, plugged it in, then pressed the timer set. The LCD is located in a hot location and LCDs do not tolerate heat. Another problem is that the white plastic stains badly and cannot be cleaned. Then recently the filter door would open by itself and cause coffee to run everywhere but into the pot, the final straw. Other than that, it made good coffee!"
4,Great Coffee But Not So Great Quality,"I gave this 4 stars because it does make great coffee, keeps it hot for a long time (in a thermal carafe, so it keeps the same great taste), and is fairly easy to maintain. However, it fell short of 5 stars because in the less than three years that I have owned it, I have had to replace the cone filter holder because it broke (and I am not rough with using the machine) and I now have to replace the entire unit because I cannot figure out why it now leaks water whenever I brew coffee. The reason I am buying this machine for a 2nd time (instead of a different machine) is because I bought an additional carafe for when I need to keep a lot of coffee brewing. I hate to think of having to throw the extra accessory away (and so now I guess I will have three carafes)."
2,Cheap Coffeemaker=Expensive Coffee,"I purchased this coffee maker in January 2006 and generally use it only on weekends. It makes great coffee, but some months ago, the automatic timer stopped working. Now, more importantly, the clip at the bottom of the cone shaped basket that holds the filter has broken. The plastic cracked into several tiny pieces, rendering the coffee maker unusable. Another issue is that the carafe can not be immersed when cleaning. If I factor in the price of the coffee maker, filters, charcoal filters, coffee and creamer, I would have been further ahead to buy coffee by the cup at the local convenience store! Unfortunately the coffee maker is just outside the one-year warranty period, so I am on my own to find a replacement basket. I feel the quality of this item does not match up to the price!"
2,OK Cofee. Not Hot. Not durable.,"We are twice a day coffe people. We figured speding $100 for a coffe maker would equal a pretty decent cup of coffe and some durability (3-5 years). Not so.This unit is elegant and the thermal carafe keeps the coffe warm without burning it (like the carafes sitting on a burner).But the unit lost a couple of pieces after a couple of months that had to be replace and after a year and a half, it is simply having trouble working.Another thing, if you like your coffe hot, this is not for you. Pouring a cup inmediatelly after brewing, gives you a warm cup at best."
4,Surprisingly good,"I expected a mindless shoot-em-up, but there are actually likeable characters we can empathize with, a servicable plot, and some clever twists, especially at the end. There's blood and violence galore, and shooting of innocent bystanders. Ving Rhames plays himself, as usual."
5,fantastic,The fight scene between Kelly Hu and Scott Adkins alone makes the film worth watching but the entire film holds up for sure. Hard to believe this film didn't get a theatrical release.
3,Expected more,I think I expected more going into this movie. There are some decent fight sequences although I would like to have seen more of Scott Adkins character. I think the Priest hams it a bit. All in all a decent buy but nothing to write home about.
4,Awesome action,"Excellent combination of awesome action, and a gripping storyline. Very appealing use of 'real' footage from CCTV, combined with GPS tagging to creat believeable use of technology. Characters were convincing, and I cared about what happened to at least a few of them. Watch it!"
3,You Know ..... This was Good but not Great,"I tracked down a copy of _The Children's Hour_ after reading raves about it and, while I enjoyed the book, it did leave me wanting more. It reads like a melding of Stephen King's _'Salem's Lot_ with _It_ (in fact, there are long stretches where the characters, talking about the monster, continually refer to it as a capital ""It"" in their conversation). I've read and enjoyed Clegg's work before (most notably, _The Hour Before Dark_) and it's always left me a bit less than fulfilled. I was really hoping for more with this book and would have liked to see more fully-realized characters, along with a more original, less-cliched take on the supernatural goings-on in the town of Colony. This really, in retrospect, reads a lot like Stephen King-lite."
5,My son loves his watch,I bought this watch as a Christmas present for my 6 year old. He is very happy with his first watch!
2,not quite right...,"My son was given this watch for his 6th birthday. The soft, stretchy band seems like a great idea for a young child. The problem is that it continuously slips out of the clasp and falls off. The watch itself stopped working (just after warranty)and was not able to be fixed at a cost that was less than just buying another watch. In hind-sight I would have gone with a more expensive, sturdier watch. This one has been a disappointment for our 1st time watch owner."
4,Watch for 5 1/2 yo,"We bought this watch for my son for graduation from preschool. He loves it. We set the time and now he uses it almost daily. He is learning how to keep time and what the time we do things (ex. 12 lunch, 8 bedtime, etc.) The button size is perfect for his fingers. I would recommend to others."
5,Going Strong,"My son got this as a gift 3 years ago and still loves it. He wears it everyday to school and likes the fact that he knows what time it is. One of his teachers said that he kept her on track. The velcro on the band is starting to show wear, but other than that no problems. We haven't even had to change batteries. Definitely worth the price."
2,Arrived in a smashed box,Watch looked cheap and band was frayed. I sent it back because it was for my grandson for Christmas...didn't make the cut.
3,Pretty good watch,"It's not a fancy watch, but it made my 9-year old happy. He lost the watch for a while (it was in his sock drawer) and he was an emotional wreck. Setting the watch was a bit unintuitive, but we figured it out eventually."
4,Great for a 6 year old,"My 6 year old was really excited about this watch. The buttons aren't very easy to push but the functions are simple enough for my son to remember which button to push to do the timer or see the date. Of course, his favorite button is the light button. However, the watch strap is for ""skinnier"" 6 year olds. My son isn't overweight but he's bigger and taller than the average 6 year old boy and he doesn't have much more room to grow with the watch strap. I'm certain that I will have to get him a big boy watch when he is nearing 8."
1,Fell apart before he even wore it,Bought this for my son's 9th birthday because he loves race cars. The lower right button fell off while we were setting it. He hadn't even worn it! Short pins used to connect to base wouldn't stay when we tried to repair it
1,Like the watch... Defective wristband design,"Got my two older boys (8 & 10) the camo Timex watches with elastic wrist bands.... They enjoy wearing them through the school year and in the summer too. Flames watch has a somewhat stiffer Velcro wrist band which is difficult for the youngest (6) to put on and wear...Looking more closely at the velcro wrist band, (prompted by the prompt for this review), I realize that the wristband is badly designed... with the flame pattern on the outside of the wrist, the velcro has to be meshed underneath the band... awkward... defective design."
5,Holds up,"She wears it everyday and it is still ok. Plays outside and to school, great product for an active kid."
1,Arrived in a smashed box,"This item arrived in a smashed box, but I believe (?) the watch works- don't know for how long! The amazon rep would not exchange it for me because I think it works, so now I have to give this gift in a smashed box, not certain if it works. This will be my last experience with Amazon, the box was so poorly packed and the customer service rep was horrible. I would not recommend to purchase this item through the mail, more likely than not it will come broken, and you will be stuck with it. Going to a store is a safer bet. A very disappointing experience, Amazon has gone downhill."
3,Poor Packaging,"Magic Molder P-20 Detail PatternItem was shipped in Original packaging (never been opened) and was covered in HEAVY RUST. Unable to wait for another to be shipped I cleaned it for use but was left with a heavily pitted body on the cutter. For the cost of these cutters you would expect them to arrive Top Quality. Cutter works fine, just looks 20 years old."
3,great for big white boards but too bulky in size,"This product arrived in great condition as expected. It looks exactly the way it was shown in pictures online. I bought this eraser based on the good reviews but because I have a small whiteboard, its bulky size took up so much space."
2,Not as precise as it's name has you to belive,"I bought this so I could erase small bits of equations on my dry-erase board (physicist), but found when I received it that it was much larger than I anticipated, thus rendering it useless as I have to write many of my formulas rather small. I love the caddy and the magnetic attachment option, but was disappointed by the angled tip, which is actually less accurate than using the corner of a typical eraser. Currently, I find the best solution is still the markers with built in erasers on the rear. They may become useless once the ink is gone, but it's a price I'm willing to pay when unlocking the secrets of the universe."
5,Expo Eraser (football),"This is an excellent eraser for reaching to tough corners. It also looks nice on the whiteboard. I had one at my other school, but it got lost in transition, so I am extremely happy that I was able to find it again."
3,Good Product but...,"This item works exactly as it should, however, there are some other issues. The glue holding the holder to the magnet broke in about 3 hours after I hung it up. I had to superglue it back together. Also, this is way bigger than you think it is. It's the size of a scrub brush. Other than that, it's a great eraser."
5,Awesome!,"It makes clean up so smooth and quick. The eraser has a wide bottom that it removes a lot of marks quickly. A great feature is that it is magnatized so it stays on the board when not in use. I would buy again, if I ever lost this one."
3,"Great, but very large and bulky.","I like this eraser as it works very well and the magnet is very strong, but the eraser really sticks out because it is so large. We keep hitting it when we walk by our whiteboard, which is in the hallway. I wish they would scale the size down, then it would be perfect."
3,fine read.,the first part of the book was well worth buying this book for. rest is about as good as any kendo books.
5,Worth the Money,"Darrell Max Craig gives the reader a good idea of the philosophy, not just a few moves of Kendo. Worth a look."
5,Must have - highly recommended.,"There is a lot to learn from this extremely informative book. It also provides an interesting perspective as the author relates his relationship with his sensei over the years. Many diagrams - shows correct and incorrect movements - so you have to read the text so that you know which diagram is illustrating a correct vs. a incorrect, wrong movement. I annotate the illustrations with pencil markings to indicate the correct vs. incorrect ones. Depicting both is actually quite informative and helpful.Must have book for your Kendo library."
1,the last samurai,"Sorry to disagree with other reviews but I thought the book was not a good read. Pretty much just as worthless as watching ""kill bill.""Just a lot of flash in the pan with no real substance. How could an american really be a true samurai anyways? That is like a Japanese man trying to play basketball here in America."
4,BUMPIN...I THINK,"i'll just start off by saying i only own a couple of drum and bass cd's...so i guess my opinion wont matter to the real dnb heads. The reason i got this cd is because i saw andy c listed in the top 100 dj's list of 2001, and i think he was the only dnb dj on the list. I think this cd kicks...i have deiselboy's 6th session and i think this cd is better. I just like listening to it more. I have been getting into dnb lately and maybe in time i could have given you a better perspective. peace"
4,Great CD,"This is good CD for casual Classical listening, new comers to classical music or the car! I love it. It has a good variety of pieces, something to suit every mood."
1,Poor Compilation,"After just one listening to this cd, I had to stop. It is just such a poor compliation of music, the flow, the rythm, it is terrible. Unlike the #1 Opera album, which I enjoyed, this one is a throwback."
5,What you need to pass,"Got this book 1 week ago. At that time i scored about 50 % on the Self Test software test. Today I passed the real thing, scoring 82 %, the only difference having read this book. In addition to covering everything you need to know about Oracle Networking to pass, it also contains invaluable hints about test-taking-strategies. Too many typos, though"
4,"Very Good, but be careful!","I recently studied for and passed the Network Exam based on this book as well as the official Oracle Study Guide for the course. The Cram book for this course is very good, but it does have some errors that could be misleading. You can purchase the Oracle Study Guide directly from Oracle but it costs more.The format of the book is excellent, and the practice exam is very good if not a little harder than the actual Certification exam. It is certainly possible to pass the exam using this book only. Good Luck!"
2,no one can fix it,I bought this camcorder no one can fix it for me the cheapest place was asking for 300$ for fixxing it even it was small problem before u buy ur thing cheak who is the best for repair after sale
3,Hardest Game I've Ever Played,"Honestly its good and all, but if you've never played an Armored Core game, DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT TRYING THIS ONE OUT. There is no tutorial, and if you pick the wrong missions, you can end up fighting TWO ACs on the SECOND MISSION. So yeah, if you get this, be smart and careful and use the online strategy guides. Anyhow, despite how unbelievably difficult this game was, it was still fun..."
1,MOST FRUSTRATING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED,i got this thinking it would be a fun creative game but i can only beat 1 mission this is much to difficult there isnt even a difficulty option if youve never played any armor core games like me dont get this im not even sure if i want to try older armor core games based off how hard this is
4,Awesome edition to the series,"I would suggest Last Raven for indivisuals who are familiar and experienced with the armored core game play .. Armored core last raven was an awesome edition to the series, a very difficult game but if you can match your mind to its game play you will find it may not be all that difficult ... Great buy for the Armored core fan Looking to complete his or her collection"
5,Best AC ever!,"Armored Core Last Raven is the best armored core yet, possibly even better than Armored Core 4, (due to the reduced part lineup). This game is Extremely biased towards AC veterans, meaning that it would appear difficult, unless you are a pro AC builder/pilot. Otherwise, you'll be addicted for days. The only bad thing i could say about this game is the amount of ""maps"" in the game, they look great, but there could be more. If you love AC, and own all other 10, this IS for you, more good old AC carnage, and Mech customization. It is a great climax to the PS2 AC era."
2,this game is too hard,i have played all of the armored cores ever since the very first one and i have to say that this game is just simply too hard to be any fun at all.i cant even get past the first mission using AC's i had from nexus.this game is a waste of money.who the heck wants a game to be so hard?
2,armored core last raven,if ur a fan of this armored core dont pick this up noting in it has change scince nine breaker its hard as hell and iam not kidding the costomosion in it is at at an all time hi. but in every mission u fight hordes of guys and at the nd ur force to beat a raven there harder then ever so wait for ps3 new title for the armored core franchise
2,"The seller is great, the game is awful",I saw this game in a Game Pro magazine when I was a kid and it looked like a lot of fun. I think this might be the worst game I've ever played. I didn't pay a lot for it though and I'm glad to have at least tried it.
1,What?,Why did they even make this game? I couldn't get past the falling rocks and got super mad. pacman2 pacs fudge.
5,Great book!,Its a great book. A friend in Israel told me about it and I buy it as gifts for friends. This copy was in great condition.
5,Cepia motorized hand spayers,"These are the worst products i have ever seen on the market, I purchased one during the winter and just used it. Went through two sets of batteries spraying less than a half pint of water. I dont recommend you waste your money on this companies product."
2,The premise was interesting but predictable.,"If I already know how it will end and all the peaks and valleys in between, why bother? The first half was okay, the last half rushed. The villain was obvious and there were no surprises except that, once again, PTSD is cured with pixie dust.It's too bad, the skeleton could have made a real cliff hanging, passionate love story. Better luck next time, Davie.Deb Kemperauthor of Mallory Ridge"
3,Plot was predictable,"Typical love story, but the reader is aware of ""who done it"" early on; not much suspense. I gave it a 3 because of the descriptive writing of the scenery and living conditions."
4,Sweet Romance,I enjoyed this book that was recommended to me by my sister in law. Just a nice sweet story to enjoy curled up on the couch.
5,waterfall glen,this is good reading .good story line. could have given a little more insight to characters but is good reading
1,my legs smell like butt,"Great at removing sunless tanner, bad at removing leg hair. Smells like rotting flesh."
2,Just OK,"The two stars is for the annoying factor of the CD. The production is good and the workouts are good. The ""warm up"" is a stretch - not a warm up and Brooke plays with her hair the entire time.The workouts are good and done correctly but Brooke's endless chatter throughout is enough to drive you mad."
5,wowzers! AWESOME DVD!!!,"This one is among my favorite workouts!!!! I love every section of it!!!! Ab workout is very hard; you may not be able to get through it all at once even if you have been working out out for awhile, so that's great! It is challenging for me every time I do this one. It makes you feel like you doing cardio....it has that kind of a feel to it, esp. when you do the leg section. Great workout. Definately something I would consider purchasing or requesting on my Xmas list! It does allow you to just pick one section of it as well. The only downer is the warm up....I can't even call it a warm up. I thought it is widely known by now that you don't stretch the cold body! Jillian Michaels offers amazing warm ups. Warm up on this dvd is pathetic but I would still buy it cause the rest of the dvd is awesome."
3,Who's the guy?,"What a strange workout. There is the guy teaching & leading Brooke in her own dvd. The cover has her name on it. I don't understand the situation. She looks like an elementary kid doing what the teacher is telling her. The exercises are good and challenging, but the guy in there bothers me. Who is the instructor anyway?"
3,Pretty good,"I have read a lot of workout video reviews and people are verrrry particular. I don't care about the music or the chatter. This is an intermediate strength training workout. Good upper body, lower body and ab workout. I do prefer routines that work multiple body parts at once and mix in some cardio. That is why I gave it 3 stars."
5,No Pain No Gain,"This workout will WORK YOU!!!! I've been doing this workout for about a month and I can tell a difference already! My pants are looser and I have so much more energy. I do this workout 3 times a week - focusing on the lower and upper body segments - do around 35 minutes of it. Like Brooke says, no pain, no gain."
3,brooke is no jillian,"I was excited to do this workout and see how Miss Brooke Burke stays in shape. I've been doing this dvd for over a week now, I like some of the exercises but i was expecting a more intense workout. i agree with one reviewer who said that she's used to doing Jillian Michaels workouts, me too. Not saying this workout was super easy but the pace was kind of slow and i didn't like the ""warm up"" and ""cool down."" i think it should've been called pointless stretching. i mean really, not everybody is that flexible. for a really good toning workout that will really make you sweat....JM's No More Trouble Zones. and plus Jillian's warm ups and cool downs are better."
3,"good toning for beginners, killer ab section","Not as tough as Jillian Michaels, so better for those who are new to training. I'm a regular gym user and found this pretty easy. However the ab section itself is worth the price-its a killer! Cute banter, and its endearing to see Brooke empathize and struggle with the exercises alongside the viewer."
3,Stop talking over your trainer,"I liked Brooke's other workout DVD much better than this one, even though I found this to be more difficult. Brooke will not stop talking over her trainer, Greg, during this workout. He starts telling you how to have proper form and she interrupts and starts talking about how she can feel the burn or other things. He even starts talking louder and over her at some points in order to be heard. Usually these things don't bother me, but it went on throughout the entire video, it was so annoying. Also her over emphasis on breathing was a bit much for me. If you can get over these annoying parts (or turn off the instruction and just listen to the music), this isn't a bad workout."
5,Love It Love It,"I love this video. The scenery was great. Brooke has a great personality and she keeps it real.This workout will have you sweating and it works the entire body with cardio and strengthen moves.Her technique reminds me of Gilad, and I love Gilad workouts. If you want a full body workout for 1hour. Get this it does the body good!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this dvd partly due to the positive reviews. I only finished about 20 minutes of it and then stopped following it. I was expecting my heart rate to increase and my muscles to feel tired. I have Jillian Michaels' No More Trouble Zones dvd and this is exactly what happens during this routine, even though there is no cardio.I did leave the dvd running, while I did my own routine. She does have some new moves that I have not seen before but otherwise this dvd was very disappointing.As background, I am 34 and workout about five days a week for 30-40 minutes. I typically do intermediate exercises."
3,Decent but was expecting more.,"The workout was decent but I didn't feel very challenged. I wouldn't say that I am a very advanced athlete, but I wasn't sore the next day and I was able to do all of the exercises the first time I did the video. I am more of a fast moving person and enjoy the crazy cardio and lots of sweating. This video is not along those lines, which may be why I did not enjoy this that much.I enjoy her personality, however she seems a bit ditzy. For example, in the beginning stretches she talks about stretching your hamstrings, however the stretch she was doing was for your quads. She also says the phrase ""Listen to your body"" way too much. Also refers to some guy ""greg"" throughout the video which was a little weird."
2,Somehow annoying,I bought this video because I was impressed with Brooke Burke's tone and tighten video. Very disappointing. The combination of Greg (who is Greg anyway?) and Brooke is annoying. This is probably a great workout but I am not interested in being annoyed by this video when there are so many other effective workout videos out there to choose from.
5,Surprisingly good workout,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this workout DVD. Brooke Burke, as it is obviously known, has an amazing body and proves that she actually works to keep it. What I enjoyed about the exercises is that although they were basic, little modifications made them more effective. I found Brooke very motivating (like working out with a friend), and the trainer was motivating like I would expect a high paid personal trainer to be. I also liked how the DVD is divided into sections (warm up, upper body, lower body, core, and cool down) so you can pick a certain section or select all categories and do them at once. The three main sections were about 15 minutes each and each exercise is done for a minute to exhaustion. I left this workout with a smile not only because I enjoyed it, but because I know if I continue this DVD the results will follow. Overall, I highly recommend this workout DVD and it will be among my more rotated (and enjoyable) workouts."
2,NOT FOR THE FAT PERSON,I wish I would of seen a review like this before I ordered this DVD. This is a great workout if you are under 160 lbs - there is alot of lifting yourbody weight - I did the best I could at 210 lbs but couldnt do all the body lifting. Its a 45 min workout broken down into 3 segments - good if youhave lost weight and now you need to tone and sculpt - good instruction - my suggestion for fat burning - try SUSAN POWTER - MOVING - the most excellentexercise tape I ever used - and you will burn calores and lose weight - its a fitness class for any size body or age - but everyone can do it at their own pace.If you have lost weight and now are ready to tone and sculpt then Brookes DVD is for you.
4,Brooke Burke transform our body,"I have been working out daily for 20 years, cardio with strength training 4 days a week and am pretty fit. I wanted to change my routine a bit and am very happy with this workout. It is challenging and I had some sore muscles that I hadn't had for a while. It also kept my heart rate up."
4,Brooke Burke Tone and Tighten,I love this DVD as well as her other Strengthen and Condition DVD. I was so sore after using this DVD the first time. It is easy to follow and you really feel like you are getting a good workout. The legs section works every part of your leg. I would highly recommend this DVD.
5,Goo Goo Dolls Live in Buffolo - Fan-friggen-tastic!,"The only thing better than the CD was the fact that the DVD came with it! Absolutely awesome. Even if you like the Goo Goo Dolls only a little, the live show is infectious, you will be hooked. The band is totally WOW, on the mark and in tune with each other and the audience. Near the end of the show they get rain soaked to the bone and they just kept going, it was awesome - I totally wished I could have been there.They are the definition of a 'band' and it's thrilling to watch them work! I can't pick a favorite song because all the songs they played were great. It's been the only CD and DVD that I've been playing since I received it! This is an amazing addition to any one's musical taste, I guarantee you'll love it."
1,Live in Buffalo,"Best Goo album by far (assuming your a fan and know the hits), and the DVD incredible. Again, you need to be a fan and know their hits...not really a bad song on entire album. (Even though Robby should leave the mic to Johnny....can't argue with success.) I'm in radio, met the guys twice but was never really a huge fan till I heard this album and saw this DVD. The fact that the 1st half of the concert is dry, and the second half is under a monster rainstorm is amazing. Best version I'v ever heard of ""Iris,"" and ""Black Balloon"" is amazing. Only regret is I wasn't there in person....BUY THIS."
2,real disappointed,"I have been a fan for a long time and Ive always loved there arder stuff. As I look at the track listing it seems mostly everything comes from there last 2 albums. I have seen them twice live and they were great both times, but without the harder stuff from A boy named goo and superstar carwash, IMO their best 2 CDs, I can't imagine they would be that great live. You would think after their last CD didn't sell that great(that was mostly soft songs) they would maybe go back to being a hard rock band. Ho Hum. Maybe someday."
5,This CD is Rocking,"True fans and new fans will appreciate the latest offering by this Buffalo based trio. The Goo Goo Dolls put on an energy filled live performance--something a studio CD just doesn't convey. This CD captures the front row experiance of going to a concert. If you've never been to a live show, they sound EXACTLY THE SAME LIVE (I think a little better), a feat many, many bands can't accomplish. Because the CD is a live show, the set list is a varied cross-section of all of their music--not just the ""hits"" everyone knows. Don't get me wrong, the Goos know which are their popular songs and they don't disappoint: ""Iris"", ""Slide"", ""Here Is Gone"", ""Name"", ""Broadway"", and ""Black Balloon"" all sound incredible. Their lesser known songs rock out as well. This a a great CD and a must have for any fans."
5,Great DVD!!!,I have been waiting for a goo goo dolls performance dvd for a while and this one is great. I like how the band put every thing they've got into their performance even when it started raining. I think the rain added a unique element to the performance!!! Get this if you are a Goo fan.
5,Great starter,Got this for my little sister because she's too young for an expensive larger ipod. She loves it & it serves its purpose.
5,Love it!,I'm enjoying my IPod Shuffle. It's so small it's best if used in a holder of some sort (cordless headphones or wrist band).
2,Its only downfall is iTunes.,"The functionality of this small player away from the computer is great... Strong battery life, simple buttons, built in clip, econimical size, etc. However, the fact that you must se iTunes with this player only decreases its overall value. iTunes certainly is much slower than the drag and drop feature that Creative Labs uses and can also be much less user-friendly."
4,Good soud quality and small size...,are a plus for this product. I am glad to have it and love the purple color option. Only wish Apple would have upgraded the 3G to 2 GB instead of the 1 GB which holds around 250 songs. It is great for the size and just what I need for running and lunch hours at work.
4,"Easy to operate, small in size","This is my first Ipod. I wanted to listen to music while I work out, by walking and cross country sking. This is it. It's so small I can bring it anywhere. Good sound too. I didn't like the fact that the software was not compatible to my windows 2000. I had to use my wife's computer. Apple's site of course wants you to buy their music, but they are pretty good about making it easy to download your own CD's. The rechargable battery is nice. I can easily go 10 hours on a charge. I like things simple and the controls are very simple. Thanks apple."
1,DOA,"It was DOA. I followed all the instructions, updated my iTunes software, bought files from the iTunes store and Amazon MP3. It always 'failed to sync.' I tried the 'help' function. Nothing worked. I called the Apple help line. They couldn't get it to work either. Fortunately, Amazon is good about returns. Mine is on its way back."
1,Horrible and pointless,"horrible for audio books, frustrating for podcasts. If you do anything other than songs, look elsewhere"
3,Uncomfortable head set,"I liked the IPOD,very easy to use and operate but I was very disappointed in the head set. They are very uncomfortable. I was surprised that Apple missed that part. I would recommend the IPOD but buy another head set to go with it."
5,fast delivery,My ipod came sooo fast it was about 2 days after I ordered it and 6 days before the day it was said to come thank you sooo much I love it!!
5,"Listen to audio books, too","I love this little guy - I listen to music only sparingly, mostly I listen to audio books - I had no problem downloading from Audible - one thing to be aware of, though - it is cheaper to purchase books through Audible than ITunes. Audible has directions on their site that tell you how to purchase from them and still download through ITunes."
5,Love It!,"I just LOVE my new shuffle. Easy to use, convenient to carry (especially on the morning walk) - the only problem is remembering to place it back on its docking station so I don't misplace it. If you're thinking about buying a starter iPod, this would be perfect."
5,I Adore It As Well...,"The software is a little cumbersome, though; not streamlined enough. All in all, perfect mp3 player. Clips easily to your person, doesn't skip and boasts great fidelity. Inconspicuous jams! It's also ergonomic enough to where you don't have to look at it to use it. This should be the only flash-based mp3 player you need."
4,iPod Shuffle- 3rd Gen.,"I bought the latest Nano based on a Shuffle I'd received as a gift. But after the Shuffle was lost (easy due to it's size) I had to have another one. The primary reason is it's small size and the handy clip. I don't need a pocket or case to hold it- just clip it onto a sleeve. I have an iMac, so it's especially easy to load music from my CD collection. I probably use the Shuffle 10-1 over my new Nano."
5,I-Pod Shuffle,I am very much satisfied with the product. This is the 2nd such item in our possession. My 10 year old son is thrilled with the first one and we bought this as a gift to a close relation. We are sure they will enjoy it hugely.
3,Good & small,"I like this player. it is really very small.Unfortunely the capacity is also small :(the biggest problem for me is, it doesnt have a display but I know it is designed as a secondary player... Fill it with music you love and enjoy listening ;)"
3,Ipod,This was a gift for my 11 year old daughter and she loves the color and loves the fact its so small and compact.
5,I love it!,I have never had an IPOD before and this little wonder fits just right around my neck during my work day. It is awesome!
5,A great companion,"I bought two IPOD shuffles. One for my husband and one for me. My teenage grandson labored for days to get just the music we wanted on it. he succeeded and it has been a joy to me. I use it at work, where I am the data entry manager, and it is wonderful to help the hours go by. It was a wise purchase. My husband uses his on the riding mower and he loves it too1"
5,ipod review,"I received my order on time, in good condition, and it was exactly like the picture showed."
5,Apple iPod Shuffle 1GB (2nd Generation),"This iPod is perfect for a 40 something female that knows nothing about technology, and does not listen to much music other than the radio. I took my few CDs that I had and downloaded them. It's very simple, and the Shuffle is so small that I can strap it on my arm when I work out. I bought one for my husband who is also technically challenged. We love them!"
5,Best MP3 player for active lifestyle,"Pros:-Georgeous! Sleek. Aluminum and not cheap plastic.-Flash. You do not have to worry about shock and vibration compared to a hard drive.-Interface. Like other Apple user interface, it is so simple to use. Not so many buttons to learn how to use.-So small-The clip is an ingenious feature in itself. You can clip to your collar, sleeve, hat, pockets... If you go to gym a lot or jogs, this is the perfect thing for you.-The earphone that it comes with does not tangle very easily.-Available in many colorsCons:-Itunes only. No drag and drop for your audio files. Although you can drag and drop files if you set it to use also as a storage device. You just cannot play the audio.-There is no screen to see song titles.-Proprietary dock (which comes with the player - do not lose it). You cannot plug it directly to USB."
1,Beware,"After puchasing the JVC GR-DVM50U 2 years ago, it is now in the shop for the 4th time. Every time we want to do somthing special with this camera it malfunctions. This time they are telling us that it will cost $546 to fix it and send it back to us. We have sent letters to the company and explained our situation and get no response. This camera has spent 5 months in the repair shop in the 2 years that we have owned it. I strongly recomend using extreme caution when purchasing any JVC product."
4,Where's the figure?,"Jango Fett's Slave I is an awesome ship. Galoob took the original Action Fleet Slave I and revised it to match the Episode II version, but fortunately this isn't just a rehash. It's a new and improved version. The paint on the hull is beautifully detailed. The fins turn even better and lock even better than the original. Moreover, there's no silly ""fuel hole"" on the side. The only problem with the ship isn't the ship itself, but the fact that it doesn't come with a figure. There's no Jango Fett. This wouldn't have been a problem with a capital cruiser, but Slave I is a small ship with a big cockpit and viewport, and the lack of a figure means the cockpit it is just empty. I can't imagine why Galoob didn't include one. If it did, this ship would have been perfect."
3,"Yes it is a handbook, but that's all","I think I would have given more stars to this book if it was actually what i was looking for. So maybe it is unfair of me.This book doesn't go into any depth or doesn't teach any of the fundamental aspects of spiritual or metaphysical development, which is dealt with more fully by other more religious books, that at first require filtration of fundamentalist attitudes and self glorification.This book teaches techniques that could be used by the gifted, but you really need to be gifted before you purchase this book. Otherwise you are wasting your time.When I bought this book I was really looking for something more focused on ""the secrets"" which did not present themselves as quick fix or 'get results immediately' type of salesman stuff."
5,Fantastic book for psychic self inprovement,The Psychic Workbook by Craig Hamilton-Parker is a claer and easy to understand introduction to the paranormal It cuts through the nonsense and presents difficult ideas in an easy to understand way. Packed full of psychic experiments and strange celebrity stories. A must!
4,Profound work that really makes one think for himself,Once again Asa displays himself an authority in another text (that was used for years in Colleges) of vast importance. He reveals (back in 1855) two crucial problems in standard logic texts that still remain to this day. But his work is not merely a negative argument but presents unique and profound insites and exercises that every logician would deem of fundamental importance. A must buy. We posted it online at truthinheart. Rick Friedrich
2,SanDisk SD 2 GB Ultra II,"The good news first: Yes, this card has good speed. I can take continuous photos using my 8 megapixel Nikon.The bad news: 3 times so far, I have had a problem with the card giving an error and it would not allow me to take more pictures. I contacted both SanDisk and Nikon. Both told me that the problem is with the card and not the camera. Apparently, the card can have formatting problems when it is exposed to ""extreme temperatures"" and can't be used to take more pictures until it is reformatted. Reformatting causes all pictures on the card to be lost, so I had the option of taking no more pictures for the day or deleting the pictures I had just taken so that I can take more (I didn't have an extra card with me). On all three occassions, the camera was with me in an air conditioned car or outside in 80 degree weather.So maybe this card will work for you if you live somewhere that has temperatures of 70 degrees 24/7. However, I don't think such a place exists..."
5,Was VERY happy with this!,"I had ordered one of these boxes a while back when one of my two elderly dogs died. I wanted something nice and relevant to keep the snippet of fur in that the crematorium sent me with her ashes. When I lost the second dog last month, I tried to find another of the same box, only to discover that it was no longer offered by Willow Tree. I found one on Amazon and while it came from another vendor, it arrived in perfect condition and came when they said I could expect it. I was very happy to find it, and to get it in such brand new good condition. It was even in the original box. The vendor let me know they had received the order, and when I could expect the keepsake box to arrive. Everything was as they said it would be. I highly recommend them."
2,Problem with Clips Cracking,I have a lot of these clips and only the white clips seem to crack during normal use. The clear clips seem to have a little more flex. During very careful normal use these white clip arm breaks off. Also 3M should include some additional adhesive strips in case the user wants to change the location of the clip after the initial positioning.
5,Required for all Eastwood fans,"We love all of Clint's ""older"" movies, and this has four of his less popular ones, and those that are a little bit harder to find. ""Kelly's Heroes"" was always one of my very favorites. When I was a teenager (lots of years ago), VCRs hadn't become popular yet, and there weren't any digital devices to be had. So when ""Kelly's Heroes"" came on one night, I got my audio tape deck and recorded the soundtrack to the movie. When I got too bored doing homework, I would pop the tape into my player and listen to the movie. To this day, I can recite 90% of the dialog, problem is, I can recite all the commercials that were on when it aired.We now own all of his Westerns, from ""spaghetti"" to ""Josey Wales"" and ""Pale Rider"", as well as all the ""Dirty Harry"" stuff. Next month...""Every Which Way But Loose"" will be on its way to my mailbox. Don't miss out on this set though, especially if you like Eastwood where he isn't always the toughest guy on the screen."
2,Kingston Trio Live,"This is simply a repackaging of a portion of the songs from the Deutsche Grammaphone album from late in the John Stewart period of the Trio's existance. The photo on the CD did not match the information in the ""liner notes"" nor the Trio that recorded the songs. Overall, even though i am a trio fan, this was a disappointing purchase."
2,KINGSTON TRIO LIVE,"I agree with the first review.The photographed trio is not the one recording. This CD is simply ""Once Upon A Time"" without the Stewart jokes."
3,"good, but not as described","The clipboard is not as pictured. It is painted, not anodized. Of course it could be anodized under the paint, though I don't know why anyone would want to do that. Three tiny bubbles or flecks in the paint on the front of the clipboard had to be sanded out to make a smooth surface.The weight is good, 8.25 ounces, quite light. The thickness, counting paint, is 0.039 inch. The clip spring is nice and strong, and makes a good grip. A single clipped sheet is not easy to pull out.This clipboard works well, and is an improvement over the easily cracking plastic ones."
4,Solid. Metal.,"I like having a clipboard around because I find that either I don't have a surface when I want to write (standing in somebody else's cube) or my surfaces are cluttered (my cube).This thing is aluminum, pretty stiff though not completely inflexible. It's got a low-profile clip. The clip works. Its usable area is a bit larger than a sheet paper.I ended up buying one for home and one for work."
2,Unreliable,"Bought two of these. They are heavy and huge, I used one for two weeks and it blew out. The other was starting to make a humming sound that scared me, so, I just threw them both out. Honestly if you're running something where you need this much wattage, you probably shouldn't be. Oh, and you can't use this with a power strip (for example to plug 3-4 things into one converter, so you will probably need 3-4 separate converters for 3-4 different items). Good luck."
4,"Good performance so far, but...","I bought this transformer as I couldn't find one in Switzerland: if you're moving here from North America, be sure you include one with your moving stuff. I paid $80 for the equipment and $200 for shipping, handling and customs. It's working good, very quiet. However, the assembly is very poor: it's a shame as it could take the same effort to do it ugly and bad than to do it right. It does the job good, though."
1,product nogood cant find anyone to return it to,i have recieved my camera it does not work at all they stated that it was still wrapped in its plastic and even though it was it had been used enough to have the paint on the buttons wore off the battery is so used up it will not take a charge or the recharger does not work and the adapter does not work`this camera is junk and now i cannot get ahold of anybody to return it to!!!!!
1,Only good for awhile,Took nice pictures and I was very happy with it until the cassette door started to not work properly and other things started acting up. It is now 14 months old and off warranty and needs to have the cassette housing assembly replaced at a price not worth considering. We were told this was not caused by neglect or improper usage.
3,Software version Not up to date,I was disappointed that this is not the most current version of viewables software . . I assumed I was buying current version of viewables software . Now I have to call Smead in order to find out how to update this software to the current version . I already opened the package and tested out the labels and do not know if this older version of viewables can be returned . The product works OK and easy to use . I just expect when paying full price one should get the most current software disk . I should of realized when there was a coupon discount there was a catch Just not right
2,disappointed,"I had much higher expectiations for this software. You should know that when you install, it overwrites the software you have in your garmin. I have the 60CSX and had topo originally, I then purchased the City Navigator, I didn't notice too much difference although I'm sure I lost some of the trail detail when I loaded City Navigator. You don't lose saved trips or waypoints though. LakeMaster does have streets and highways but you loose lots of detail. Basically the software gives you slightly more detail on the water area with some depths, landmarks like lights at the mouth of a river but, I was dissapointed into the lack of detail. If you buy the CD you will want to buy a Scandisk microdisk and swap your cards when you want to switch from trail or street to water. I can tell you I only used it on a couple bodies of water but I was disappointed. I would not have bought it if I could have looked at it on someone elses unit. By the way, I love my City Navigator."
3,"Interesting, not essential","This has a winning combination--Lee Konitz + Fred Hersch--but somehow this album never clicked with me. It has a peculiar ""concept"", in that all of the tunes are done as waltzes, whether or not they were originally written in 3/4 or 4/4. The real oddity here is ""Giant Steps"", which is done first as a relaxed waltz & then (like many of the tracks) they use a metrical transition to get into a quicker 4/4.... though at this point the chords are at half-speed so it's not quite the tortuous maze of chords that Coltrane devised! A nice ""Someday My Prince Will Come"", a good Konitz original, & in general the album's fine, but it's not a standout, & the waltztimes got to me after a while for some reason."
1,yuck,"this book is full of whining about how she got picked on all the time in school.i will be the first to stand up against bullying,but she was really asking for it.she was ugly and so took 900 gallons of vitamin s a day to look like a man?what kind of solution is that?and with such logic,what makes anyone think she has the brains to write a good book?and with her lesbionic,pms fueled rage she got into the wwe and battled men.maybe she is a man.for the longest time ive been thinking.she's ugly like a man.she's built like a man.she can beat a lot of the wwe men up.she can take a hit like a man and not go down.or maybe she does,who knows?and she slept with like everyone!every royal rumble,she had a new man......triple h,mark henry,chris jericho,eddie guierro.was that her back up plan behind making herself into she hulk?this book is a bunch of whining,performance enhancing extras,switch hitting,heshe hulking nonsense!"
4,Meagen Ryan (aka) Chyna JennAiello (aka) MissKitty,My Best Friend Meagen is Chyna Ninth Wonder of the World makeing Optimus Prime the strongest autobot in the world! And Me Jenn Aiello is Miss Kitty! What a great book... Take it from Optimus Prime you'll love it!
1,She's a better wrestler than an author,"I've always thought that Chyna was the most beautiful woman in the WWF...even before all her surgical enhancements. Great wrestler. Great entertainer. Beautiful woman. This book, however, is so bad, I couldn't even finish it. It's profanity laced...hardly material for her younger fans. She has excuses for all of her bad behavior...constantly whining about her dysfunctional family. You're a big star now Chyna. For Pete's sake, get over it!It's full of pictures we've all seen before, so nothing new there. No real new insight or perspective. She wasn't real kind to her teacher, ""Killer"" Kowalski.Not only would I not recommend buying it, I wouldn't even recommend borrowing it from the library! I gave it one star only because Amazon wouldn't let me give it none."
3,"Decent, but it's definetely no 'Have A Nice Day'...","There are just a few things I would like to say about this book in general. First of all, it's an extremely easy read and the font and the spacing of lines leads you to believe they could've pulled this book off in a little over 100 pages. Second, after a masterpiece by Mick Foley, and an ""OK"" effort by The Rock and his co-author, the quality of this book is such that it provides insight into the interesting life of Chyna without any redeaming value or any Mick Foley-like detail. In a way a feel satisfied, but in a way I feel cheated...and I didn't feel that way after reading 'Have A Nice Day'."
2,Jumping off Track.....,"I honestly have to say it was a good book towards the end. She jumps around so much with her stories that it is sometimes hard to tell which subject she was on. When she finally started getting to the stuff that had to do with wrestling I couldnt put the book down. I know she worked her (...) off to get where she was but it sounds like a lot of her moving up so quickly had to do with Triple H. Where would she have gotten if not for him? She sounds like a very self-centered person and I cant say that I would want her as a friend in my everyday life. She made herself out to be a person who would step on anyone to get what she wanted which it sounds like is what she did to Triple H who is the one person who got her where she is today. Sorry Chyna, I liked you much better before your book!"
3,Wait for Paperback.,"Okay, I love the Ninth Wonder of the World as Much as the nextguy. Yes, you find out about Joanie Laurer's dysfunctional home life. Yes, you find out about Joanie's experiences with Killer Kowalski. Yes, you see the events that eventually shaped Joanie into Chyna. But this book is CERTAINLY not suitable for all of the Ninth Wonder's fans. Were it a movie, it would be rated R, talking about everything from her relationship to Paul LeVesque (Triple H) to the night Savio Vega's clothesline made her implant explode. The book is 316 pages, but has large type and is almost half pictures. I'm no speed reader, and I had it read in under two hours. To sum it up? An okay book made worse by Chyna's potty mouth. (Or is it potty hand?) The lack of content didn't help either."
3,Autobiography of Chyna,"I'm not a fan of the WWF. I'm also not a fan of car wrecks either, but I do slow down and survey the damage (don't we all), and a car wreck would be apt metaphor for Chyna's (Joanie Laurer's) life. So many events conspired to push her down, you would expect her to live a mediocre life, but no, somehow she rises above it and becomes a wrestling superstar. That is what this book is about.Although this book is poorly written, disjoined, double-spaced, and bordering on a literary version of attention deficit disorder, that just adds to picture. The majority of the book deals with Joanie's difficult childhood, and is saturated by old grudges. The final part of the book details her rise to fame and fortune.This is definitely a unique autobiography aimed at wrestling fans, but I found it entertaining nonetheless. If you happen to find it in a resale shop, like I did, it might be worth a look."
3,Not interesting at all,"I'm a wresting fan and I've always been interested in Chyna. I figured her book would provide some insight in to her life. If I wanted to see a photo album I'll look for pictures online.. I wanted to read about her. There really wasn't a lot of information about her in this book. The title throws you off a bit.. ""If they only know"".. Well tell us something! Not a good book by any means."
4,Left a bad taste in my mouth?,"Not hardly. I think this is a wonderful book showing insights into a very complex person. I read it in one sitting and loved every minute of it. If your expecting from Chyna, to give you the unexpected, buy this book. If your expecting the same old Biography that you've read on dozens of others (besides the exceptional work of Mick Foley) , then stay away. Open your mind, let Chyna speak. You will enjoy what she has to say."
1,The book jacket is nasty!,"The book jacket has coffee and food stains on it. When I wrote them to tell them about it they said I placed a ""special order in replacement of this one and it is on it's way."" When I checked the slip for the replacement order that I supposed to had placed, which I didn't, it says I'm being billed for the replacement for this one. This is bad business and I don't pay for bad business!"
1,If they only cared.......,I'm a big fan of wrestling... but who cares about Chyna... Please god stop the insanity... this book isnt even good enough to use as a paperweight!
3,We want to know more....,"I think it is better than the Goldberg book, with some very good inside comments hidden between the lines. She has a limited wrestling history has she is not a 25 years old veteran so there was not enough wrestling stories to my liking still a very interesting read. For exemple she browse over 2000 and this was a big year for her in wrestling and there is no story on her appearances on Third Rock from the sun. A good read but not like Mick Foley's book."
1,Not Worth the $29,"Anybody who thinks this is a good book.... should get out and read more. There are so many facts that could be detailed more, but just glossed over. She never used steroids? Whatever? And why did she not go into detail about having her jaw restructured in order to look more ""beautiful""? I guess that blows away the ""I know I'm pretty"" schitick through out the book right out of the order. If you like it, take 5th grade literature over again"
3,If you only knew... about this book...,"Frankly, Chyna's book was short, cute, and to the point. It was much more entertaining than the Rock's and far less entertaining than Mick Foley's. The thing that bothered me the most was that she told the stories all out of order. ""Here's a story about my exploding implant."" ""Here's a story about high school."" ""Here's a story that happened last week."" Her non-chronological habit made the book a bit confusing, but nontheless, a quick, entertainig read."
1,If they only cared.......,I'm a big fan of wrestling... but who cares about Chyna... Please god stop the insanity...
2,Ummm....,"First of all, I must say that if you liked Joanie Laurer (Chyna)before reading this book you won't like her after reading it. I supported her until reading this book. It's far too vulgar even even for a navy sailor (which I am). At least in Mick Foley's book (which is a masterpiece) he only uses profanity when quoting someone. But Joanie uses it any chance she gets. And she insults EVERYBODY, even a fan that asked for her autograph (it's a rather rude comment too). Plus she's such a hypocrit. She complains that people made fun of the way she looks but then in her book she constintley makes a comment about the appearance of someone else. And she's so egotistical (read any interview she's ever done and you'll notice even without reading the book).Other gripes. The book was way too short, it's not in chronological order, no real indept stories except for maybe one or two, and was not worth the price. The only redeming factor is that there are some funny moments in it."
2,"Great story, poorly written","I'm a fan. No doubt about it. A fan of the WWF, a fan of Chyna. It was great finding out about the woman behind the leather. Chyna has a story to tell that's riveting, sad, funny, and insightful. Yet, I was VERY disappointed with the writing. It seemed that the writer, Michael Angeli, had never watched wrestling. He calls SummerSlam...Summer of Slam! So while I still suggest reading the book, know that the writing style is lacking!"
1,Not What I Expected!!,"As much as I like Chyna, this book blew!! (literally) She would start a subject and never really finish it. She started to tell us about her childhood and never really filled in the blanks. She told some of how she became a wrestler, but it sounded more like she slept her way around and got to the WWF via HHH.(not cool)The best part of the entire book is when Mick Foley chimes in and writes a little something, as usual he makes me laugh. Other than that it seems rushed and piecemealed. I would like to see her try again and with a different person helping her out. Mr. Angeli didn't do her any justice, or he didn't read what he was helping to write. This time concentrate on her athletic abilities rather than try to talk like a sailor. And, if you are gonna talk like a sailor it should at least be in the proper context. She throws in cuss words like an after thought. If you are gonna swear, you otta' do it right. Sorry, Chyna. But I still think you are awesome!"
3,Average fare.,"Joanie,or Chyna seems to have a lot of bitterness. The book was kind of dull in my opinion,and she does give the impression she has a bit of an ego."
2,Chyna is better in the ring,"i strongly disagree if you want to buy this book. this book is not fun to read at all and it have too much ""F' word. chyna did a very bad job in writing a book but she's one of my favorite superstar in the ring."
4,Great when it works!!!!,"I have been using this software for a few months and loved it until I ugraded my CD Burner to an AOPEN 2440 CD Burner. The CD CREATOR PLATINUM just does not recognize the new hardware, so I returned the new CD Writer drive and bought an LG 16x 10x 40x which is a great CD writer and actually comes with the CD Creator 4 software. Even though CD Creator 4 works with the new burner the Platinum version doesn't and I haven't been able to find a way to use it since I have the new hardware. MAJOR COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS, and neither the Hardware companies nor the software companies have a FIX."
1,"Crap, total crap.","XP users beware. Don't beware even, be smart and avoid. This is crap and not worth the headache of trying to get it to work. Crap Crap Crap"
1,Doesn't work on windows 2000,"Don't even think about buying it for 2000. Just to be very clear, I am running 2000 server. I have always loved Easy CD Creator from Adaptec, and when this product gets fixed, it will be great as well. It's just not ready for prime time right now.BTW, who is Roxio? Did they buy this product line from Adaptec? Too bad, they aren't doing a good job of QA.brian@innovtech.com"
2,Upgrade for upgrade's sake,"This product offers little or no improvement from the last version (OK, it's nice to be able to convert back to MP3 format from WAV, but how many shareware programs can do that?). I don't know about the W2K boot problems but the no CD text support bites! Oh, and your customer support runs out after 90 days...so think carefully........ not the most customer oriented company..."
1,Former good product.,"Have used this product for several years. Current Rev and Customer Support has gone down hill fast. The currently corrupt product, combined with non-existent Customer Support is bad enough but the product is also corrupting many Computers, especially Windows XP. Not only do I recommend that you not buy the product, dont even try it out as it will possibly wreck your Windows Operating System. If you want to know more, check out ""Roxio's Discussion Groups"" on the web (now known as ""Roxio's Disgusted Groups""). Its too bad - it used to be a good product and I had recommended it in the past. I and others have lost all trust and respect in Roxio. Fortunately there are other good competitive products available."
1,"HELP,HELP.........","I have winxp pro and all the space on my unit that's needed....I have TRIED, 5 times, to get this thing to work right, but have been unable to yet. For the pass two months, I'll tried, once I had to have my hold system wiped and reloaded. Each time since it has stop windows from closing. If anyone can help PLEASE.....Kofi-1"
1,Disappointed,"I received and installed this, only to find that two of its features - Direct CD and Take Two have been disabled due to problems. These were the main reasons I purchased the software."
1,Easy CD Creator 5,I have used Easy CD Creator 4 Delux since it came out. I just got a new PC with Windows XP Home Edition. Easy CD Creator 4 does not work with my new PC. I tried Easy CD Creator 5 and it is worse. It caused me many problems. Roxio was no help.
1,Almost bought CD Creator 5,"...I have WindowsXP. From what I read in these reviews, there is a real risk of corrupting my system with this software! My old computer had NERO 5.5 It came with my TDK burner. Too bad this version won't work with Samsung burners. I already emailed them to ask. It was packaged only with TDK drivers on the disk. Tomorrow, I'm buying a full, new copy of NERO!"
1,Lemon of the Year Award for ECDC v5,"I used ECDC v3 and v4 for the past 2 years as it came bundled with my Iomega Zip650 CD-R. I was pretty pleased with the straightforward music burning interface and DirectCD features.After upgrading my o/s to Win XP, I installed ECDC v5 and the latest patch from the Roxio site. In short, it is a piece of garbage. Wouldn't even test my CD-R for recording capabilities. Refused to write anything to it, period. And to make matters worse, it wouldn't recognize any of my v4 cd layout (.cl4) files. This is the same story when I upgraded from v3 to v4!Roxio is incompetent and completely out of touch with it's customers. Go with the Nero Burning software instead. Thank me later."
1,No Stars?,"Lousey support. Uninstall/install problems. You can't seem to get the thing fully uninstalled and then the install turns around and hangs with ""a previous installation"" error. Yeah. That's good software. Right from the start you've got problems. Pure c&*p."
5,Pay no attention to bad reviews if you have version 5.1,"This is the best burning software I've ever used. It does everything I want it to do, and then some. I installed version 5.1 on my computer running Windows 2000 Pro, and it's run flawlwssly so far.Windows 2000 and XP users: Like many here have already said, get the version that doesn't advertise the ""Take Two"" feature, and make sure the box has a blue corner that says, ""enhance your Windows XP burning experience"" or something like that."
1,Stay away if you have Windows XP,"I upgraded to Platinum without reading the reviews of actual users. Last time I make that mistake. After spending two hours attempting to install/ reinstall and downloading the useless fixes from Roxie, getting no help from there Techs - in order to be able to use my PC in any fashion, I had to completely uninstall Roxie and the Basic verison that came with my PC. Even with Roxie completely off, my PC Still takes along time to Boot - Roxie really made a mess of things.Platinum created such a mess - I am looking for a new product and refuse to reload the basic.In Short - if you have XP - RUN FOR THE HILLS - It will not work."
1,I wish I'd read these reviews before buying Easy CD Creator,"I bought this because I didn't want to jump through the hoops you have to jump through to get the older 3.x version to work on 2000. I thought it would save time, but ended up wasting 4 hours. I couldn't have installed the old 3. version with the patches and tweaking in less than 1.I've heard of people having trouble easy cd creator, but this is the first time I have, but once makes up for all the others.Wait for the next rev. to buy easy cd creator if you use Win2K"
3,The Bells and Whistles are Cute,"Why doesn't Easy CD Creator recognize my second CD drive? These and other questions are bound to nag you if not stopping you dead in your CD-imaging tracks. Yes, you can kind of mix tracks. And yes, you can boost tracks so that they all record at the same level, but these perks work in two totally separate recording programs included in the Platinum software. Why are there 2 different recording programs? Ahhh, the questions, the questions.... For those of us who are philosophically minded, this program will provide hours if not days of contemplation. For those of us who actually want to record CDs, there must be a better program out there."
1,Warning: This software will destroy Windows 2000!,"I bought this software because I had used ECDC Pro version 4. But version 4 will not install if Internet Explorer 4 is not present - even if IE 5 is installed. That was bad enough, but the fix on the Roxio site did nothing - it was a registry entry that didn't have anything to do with the problem. I upgrade to 5 only to find that ECDC 5 seems to be designed primarily to cause blue screens in Windows 2000. I didn't need to pay $99 up front for that kind of feature, so I thought I'd uninstall and return it. I had tried installing it on two PCs, following the instructions on Roxio's site. I uninstalled it from both, and now both are unable to boot. If you have Windows 2000, make sure you have another form of backup before you chance this dog!"
4,Surprised To Be In A Minority...,"After reading the phletora of negative reviews, I noted that the folks who liked this product were incredibly favorable. I must put myself in the latter category. I'm using the product with Windows XP, after the new operating system rendered my previous CD burning software useless. I found Platinum to be superior to what I had with good support under the XP platform. The mixing capabilities are grand, as well as the ability to store photos and video on a mixed media disc. I highly recommend this product for use with XP, especially if you're like me and Microsoft's latest OS has taken away your right to burn."
1,Want to waste time AND money?,"Gee, if you've got a spare [money] and loads of time on your hands, this is the product for you! Three tries at installing this program, along with the downloads to upgrade to XP from their website (by the way, why can't they come out with a version that you BUY with XP compatible software on the disc???) and it still doesn't work. Plus, it wipes out your drives every time you try to install (thank heaven for the XP ""Restore"" function). Three strikes and you're out, as far as I'm concerned, along with the three hours I wasted trying to get this garbage to work. A real shame, because Roxio 5.0 Platinum worked on my old Windows 98 operating system just fine. Get it together, Roxio. As for all you potential customers -- save your money."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I have never dealt with a worse company than Roxio---both their tech supportand their customer support. First the software would not work. After more than 3 hours with 3 different tech support people, they concluded that the software would not work. Then the fun started. I had ,at Roxio's direction, uninstalled my original cd burner. Now Roxio offered to refund my money----if I would jump through their hoops. Imust return all materials at my expense and time. I asked them for replacement software for the software that they caused me to lose. Their response??? That's tough. We have no responsibility for your previous software. Beware. The product doesn't work, and neither does Roxio's support or service."
1,Windows XP Users Beware of the Product,"Easy CD Creator works fine on older versions of Windows. But don't try to use it on anything newer than Windows 98. The program freezes so badly it can't be soft booted. The CD's are ruined forever. Sometimes the drive won't even open, it just keeps burning for hours and can only be stopped by a hard boot. The ""fix"" for Windows XP from the Roxio site took 50 mins. to download on dialup and then it failed! My advice is to avoid Easy CD Creator until Roxio comes out with a better product."
1,Destroyed Windows 2000 OS Installation,"I upgraded to version 5 for Windows 2000, Roxio didn't provide any warning for their ""KNOWN"" bugs on Windows 2000. Now, the machine will not boot and Roxio has NO resolution. Don't buy it for Windows 2000!"
1,Need an upgrade for Version 4? 5.1 may disappoint you.,"I love Easy CD Creator version 4. So when I update my Operating System, I decided to upgrade Easy CD Creator. Navigation in the program from the audio to the data layout and to the label maker is not as easy as with the previous version. Worst of all, 5.1 will not open layouts made in version 4. So instead of an upgrade, 5.1 is basically a whole new product, in some ways inferior to the old one, but the old one will not work will Windows XP."
1,Easy CD Creator Killed my System,I have never been more disappointed in a product. In spite of following all advice from Roxio tech support Easy CD creator still hard crashes my system every time I attempt to use it.
1,Problems abound,"I have had no end of problems with this product, and the update makes them worse. I don't have any of the peripherals that Roxio claims are causing the problems, so I would recommend this procedure: uninstall 5.0 and go back to 4.0."
1,Don't buy this if you have windows XP!,"It doesn't work on XP, even though it clearly states that it does on the box. What a joke!! It won't install because it thinks there's another version there, but there isn't so there's nothing to uninstall. Who makes software that can't uninstall itself? Who makes software that can't upgrade itself? Roxio took a decent program and trashed it. If you don't believe me, go to support.roxio.com. Enter the message board for this product and do a search under ""installation"". You will see thousands of hits with the same problem."
1,Not Compatible with Win XP,This product does not recognize a cd-rw disk and ejects the cd tray. The Roxio Support Website is useless. Roxio updates do not correct the problem. I would not recommend this product to XP users.
1,What about on the fly recording,"This software does not record on the fly. The full image is always created even on U2W SCSI HDD ! Last time for 74min cd it requested over 1GB temp space it is not even a beta software, great many bugs DO NOT BUY THAT PRODUCT, you'll be sorry if you do ;-("
1,Incompatible with Windows 2k Pro,"No Stars, really. The compatibility issue is a nightmare. I spent several days with my workstation on the lab bench as a direct result of Roxio/Adaptec's lethal incompatibility with Windows 2000 Pro. The cost of the Roxio/Adaptec software and the cost to recover from the damage was significant but irrelevant. The workstation downtime and potential embarassment have me steamed. : Seth H. Bokelman told you the truth. Don't install it 5.0 w/ windows 2000 pro, the damaging results are beyond comprehension. You would rather be attacked by a virus than install Adaptec 5.0. The virus would be easier to recover from. I don't know how else to warn you. Roxio will ask for more money to talk about it, too."
1,If It Were A Tire Ford Would Stop Using It!,And Roxio would be FORCED to recall it! Save yourself some grief and don't even consider this product.
1,A peice of junk,"It was forced to put 1 star. No choice. I just bought a Memorex 52X CD-writer. It comes with the Nero 5.X. But I got some old CD-RWs that created under EZ CD Creater V3.X (or ?) and couldn't read by Nero. I decided to install the EZ CD5. During the insatllation, a message ""Unsupport driver was found"" popup. ...The Memorex 52X is the latest technology. It doesn't support. I got it for free, and know now why I got it for free. It is a peice of junk. Go for Nero!!!..."
4,CD Burning,"I bought this software to use with XP and my edition is ""rev c"". I loaded the CD and then downloaded the patches from roxio before rebooting. So far so good. I especially like the ability to burn the photos so that the CD opens with a slide show when loaded.I'm looking forward to using more features................"
2,Save your money,"I used this mainly for dropping/dragging data files to back them up. It worked fine for a while, but after a while when I tried to format a new CD-RW, it got hung up in the verification process in an infitine loop and wouldn't even let me shut it down without rebooting the computer. The installation disk has a ""repair"" option, which I used several times successfully, but eventually even that didn't work. This is the first time I've ever seen a ""repair"" option on an installation disk, and now regard that as a very red flag that the software has some major problems. Try something else before trying either the Basic or the Platinum versions, as I had the same trouble with both of them."
1,PLEASE don't load this software ---- YOU'LL BE SORRY !!!,"I really regret loading this product. I have a Gateway computer with Windows XP, Home Edition. When I installed this, the software somehow disabled my built-in CD burner and a separate DVD player. I tried uninstalling it , but ha ha ha. Removing ""Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum"" involves inserting the product CD back into the CD drive, but the CD drive can't read the disk as it no longer works, so I'm completely stuck. The patches available from their web site didn't help matters at all. I cannot believe Roxio can get away with their lousy technical support. I will NEVER purchase another Roxio product again."
1,Will Not Load onto XP,"Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates. So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt. If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine."
2,Just hope you don't need support!,"while this particular product, CD Creator 5.0, may work fine in most cases if you choose to use the default installs and not Take Two (see previous reviewer), I rate Roxio a minus one, and therefore the product a two. If you use Windows 2000 and have multiple disks or dual boot, forget it. Not only does the product not do well if you try anything sophisticated with it, but the company won't help you either.The support for their products is very poor. Not only do you have to call a toll number and have to wait on hold for upwards of an hour, but they are extremely unhelpful online as well. I would really recommend against any product from this company at all until the support attitudes and policies are changed.Please, let everyone you know who is looking for CD Creation software know to shy away from this company and their products."
1,Absolute Disaster - My Last Attempt With Roxio,"The only application which has given my trouble since upgrading to XP is Easy CD Creator. After going through the hoops to uninstall version 4, buying Version 5 Platinum, installing it, downloaded patches, etc. .... the thing still does not work. My previously stable 900 MHZ system suddenly restarts when doing unrelated work. I've uninstalled the **** thing and now have a working computer again. Roxio ships junk and wastes countless lifetimes worth of it's customer's time. Do not buy this junk unless you are prepared for headaches. I've been successfully using PCs since the very first IBM PC and this is without a doubt the worst piece of software I've ever bought."
1,"Platinum 5, problems with Win XP","I recently installed Easy CD Creator Platinum 5 straight out of the box, nothing but problems. The software does not recognize my CD-RW drive so there is no way of using it. I have a VAIO desktop with Win XP and not only is the product useless but it also disabled the ""Auto shut-off"" feature of my compuer. When I ask my computer to turn off it re-boots instead of turning off. I have to turn it off by holding the on button. What is worse I uninstalled the software and the problem is still there. I am aware of the web patch/upgrade (17+ Megs, nightmare for phone line users) but it didn't solve all problems. I advise all XP users to hold off until a proper compatible version is released."
1,"DESERVES A ZERO, DO NOT BUY!!!","I installed this product on my PC after formatting my hard drive and this piece of junk locked up my PC. After losing 6 hours trying various ways to repair Win2k I had to reformat my hard drive again, losing weeks of work. How can a company sell a product which they state works with Win2k when it doesn't. (...)"
4,Pretty good burning software,"My first CD burner came with a stripped-down version of Easy CD Creator, I think version 3. When I had to make a VideoCD, I upgraded to 5 Platinum and it works great. Better interface and tools allow easy CD burning.However, I have since upgraded to Windows XP and the patch available on Roxio's website adds XP compatibility and fixes a lot of bugs, especially with DirectCD. Even though Roxio designed WinXP's built-in CD burning software, I prefer Easy CD Creator much better."
2,Music not photos,"This product is fine for copying Music CD's, but it is a pain for photo files. The file formats are not compatible with lots of CD's so you can't share the CD like I expected you could. It is fine for backing up your files for playback on your own machine, but not for swapping. Maybe I'm not using the program correctly, but I've spent too much timing trying."
2,Not That Good,"This DVD Player should read DVD from zone 1 to 6, but it really cannot. I tried it with a DVD from France, and it won't work."
2,CRASH & Burn,Very poor product. Custome service not much better. Don't even think about using it on Window XP. Buffer underrun errors constantly. I switched to Nero 5.5. and have not had any problems so far.
2,Easy CD Creator 5 - Not keeping up with hardware!,"I eagerly anticipated using this latest version of Roxio's CD writing software when I bought my Backpack cd-rewriter, model 193200. I was dismayed when [they] had not updated the software to be compatible with a model that is now stocked in...stores throughout the country. All [that] needs to be done] is some registry updates... I've got to change a device setting on my own so the software thinks I've got an older model..."
3,Know what you are doing,"The program is not for the faint at heart. While I love the way you extract songs from another cd a few other things are shady. Version 4 was much better. I went through the patches and it was not simple, so if this is not your thing be careful or get help. I would like to to talk to roxio about little annoying quirks that would make this a ""perfect"" version. So if they are interested......"
1,Do a full backup before installing...,"and have a second computer available to use while you sort out all of the installation BS with this product. It was actually working well, until I put a Zip disk into my zip drive - then a blue screen reboot and nothing but trouble."
1,Just plain bad!,"This was one of the worst products i have ever seen. the basic cd creater came with my computer and since it was limited, i decided to buy the upgrade, which is this one, the platnum edition. it screwed up my computer! not at all compatable with windows xp! first is lagged up my computer when i wasn't even using it. it made it impossible for me to access the internet when not using it as well. just having it installed on my computer was horrible! my computer wouldn't turn off. i'd tell it to shut down and it would just restart every time. i realized that it was the roxio program that was the problem when i uninstalled it. also while i was tryingt i burn mix CD's many different errors would occur and it would never work. due to this i wasted at least 4 CD-R's. this is a very poor product. i do not at all recommend it!"
2,Forget Using Version 5 for LPs and Tapes,"The Platinum 5 version adds ""repeats"" that did not exist in the original recording. It takes 3 minutes to record a song, and an hour to remove the short ""repeats"" the software adds. It sounds like the LP skipped backwards only it didn't. After following every instruction from the first, what looked like a canned response, from customer service there was no improvement. It has been a week and I have not heard from customer service, I'm assuming there is no fix, meaning the software was released with this bug."
2,Roxio update limits usability,"When I first purchased Easy CD Creator 5, I loved it. Coping data, music CDs was easy. Then I checked the Roxio update page and downloaded an update which eleminated several of the functions. In my opinion this update should be avoided. Appearently CD Creator has a problem with the larger HDs available now. I have a 40 Gig HD and had no problem until the update was downloaded. I am looking for new software for my burner."
1,a real POS,"This system is to be avoided. It is a waste of money. A real POS!! When you try to copy a CD it cuts off about a second from the end of each track. Customer ""service""? Forget it! They don't respond to e-mails and if you try calling you get put on hold for a half an hour and then when they finally condescend to answer, you get ""I dunno."""
1,More bugs than an ant farm!,"Like many other reviewers, I had been using--and loving--Easy CD Creator for years. When it was an Adaptec product, I had little or no problems, and burned dozens of problem-free CDs. Now, under Windows XP, Easy CD Creator (V 5.1 with upgrade patch) has become a piece of garbage. I'm now producing more coasters than usable CDs. At first, I thought it was the burner itself, but the unit works fine when using MusicMatch software (an occasional problem emerges, but not to the degree that I'm ready to pull my hair out). I will simply write this off as a bad investment and will never buy another Roxio product. I would not give 5.1 any stars!!!"
2,Be wary if you have Windows ME,"I purchased this program because I wanted to burn VCD disks and I had the old Easy-CD 3. Unfortunately it seems to dislike Windows ME. The software would not install and I was unable to load any patches because they said ""no recognized version exists"". I worked with tech support and they finally said I had to re-install my OS.I wiped my hard drive and re-installed Windows ME fresh and still had the same problem. So I guess I'll just wait until I upgrade to XP and hopefully it will work.I gave it 2 stars based on the original version 3 I had and the assumption that it would be pretty good if I could get it installed..."
2,Overrated,Easily the most popular CD burning software but just as easily the most frustrating. I have wasted more CDs using this software. It does not handle USB very well. It is just plain written dumb. I could go on and on. The screens do not flow well when moving around. It is like VHS VS Beta sometimes the most popular is not the best. Anyways try Nero. PS: I have heard the exact same comments from other technical folks. They do not like Easy CD Cremator!
1,Buyer Beware....,"You've probably heard ad nauseum the importance of backing up your critical data before making any significant changes to your system in the event of a system crash. Nah! Couldn't happen to me!I agree with many of the other reviewers here. DO NOT INSTALL THIS SOFTWARE WITHOUT BACKING UP YOUR SYSTEM FIRST, AND BACK IT UP REGULARLY AFTER INSTALLATION AS THIS SOFTWARE WILL LIKELY KILL YOUR HARD DRIVE.Prior to my recent system crash, which from everything I've learned was caused by this software, I would have given it a 4 rating. Really user friendly GUI; easy to use; somewhat limited features.Now, having put in over two weeks of all nighters to recover data and reinstall my operating system and applications, I wouldn't touch this or any product made by Roxio until they produce a more stable product. ..."
1,No Support,"I recently bought a cd writer, acer, and it came with 4.x software. When I upgraded to windows xp, I found out that they did not, or no longer, supported it, and wanted me to purchase, for 99 dollars, their platinum version, which was the only way I could use it. I already had that product, and found it hard, and very combersom to use, plus, it didn't work real well with xp, even after the updates. Could not rewrite to a cd rw. Tried Nero, and it worked fine. Wanted to try to nti, but ran out of trial time... never did get a chance to try it. Recommendation, DON'T waste your money!!!"
1,Pure Garbage,"I had heard about the problems people with Windows 2000 were having, but since I have Windows 98 I didn't think I would have any problems. I had used Easy CD Creator 3.5 and was happy with the product. Easy Creator 5 is garbage. Even after installing the available updates and taking all 17 steps recommended by their tech staff, the program wouldn't even copy a simple music cd. When I gave up and reinstalled the 3.5 version, it again worked perfectly. Do not buy this product! PS They won't let you post a review without giving at least one star. It doesn't deserve it."
3,SOLUTION to installing Easy CD Creator on WinXP,"Easy SOLUTION (It worked for me using Easy CD Creator 5 Basic) to why Roxio will not install on WinXP (re: data.cab error message 1311, cant read Data.cab)Copy (not move) the entire CD to a dummy directory on your hard drive(for example c:TEMPINSTALL.). Remove the CD. Then execute the setup (Setup.exe) from this temp directory in the hard drive.. I also have had to do this for some other programs under XP (e.g., Norton System Works 2002). [also Word 2000] After the Easy CD Creator is installed, then just delete the c:TEMPINSTALL directory.I found this info from a posting at Annoyances.org from a Mr. R.H"
4,Better than Version 6,"Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called ""Burning CD's for Dummies"", it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you."
2,not compatible with windows xp as advertised,"I have been able to get Easy Creator 5 (platinum) to burn a cd on my burner that came with my Dimension L800r dell P.C. However I get a message everytime I turn on my P.C. that a driver has been deactivated from Roxio and that this version of software is incompatible with windows xp, and to contact roxio for an upgrade to make this product work properly. I have tried unsuccessfully to get a patch for this product and all I get is an ad to purchase a new version of software from Roxio at approximately $100...How do I resolve this without purchasing a newer version for $100...GL"
3,kinda slow,This product is good but it sometimes slows down and almost freezes. I use this with xp and it is much slower in reaction time compared to use with windows lower than xp.
2,Buy Nero instead.,I gave this program to my Dad when I got Nero Burning ROM with my new writer. I don't miss it at all...
1,So many XP Problems!,"If you want to learn everthing there is to know about XP then this product is the one for you. I had so many problems and with no customer support, that I truly became an expert in how to remove software from my computer. Finally I tried NTI's CD MAKER 2000 and NERO. Both products actually worked with no problems, unlike ROXIO. I went with NTI CD MAKER 2000, just liked to user interface, price and customer service a bit better than NERO, but I really like things simple."
4,Great Prouct if u have 95 or 98,I just bought the Easy CDc creator 5 product. It worked great for me. I have a windows 95. I can copy CD's or make a mix from various cd's. But the only bad thing is when I try to burn MP3's it only records 30 seconds of them??? N E 1 Know Y? But it works fine for data and video cd's other wise a great product for ur new CD burner. But if u have windows 2000 I hear it dosent work so.... thats bad. but windows 95 & 98 it works perfectly!!!!
3,Half a loaf is better than none...?,"ECDC 5 Platinum would not work under XP as it came out of the box from ..., but updating it for the 5.1 patch as contained on the Roxio website seemed to solve that. (Still, why not publish a full, working product?)However, I *still* cannot get Session Selection (to be able to access multiple data recording sessions on one CD) to work on either my DVD or CD-ROM drives on my 4-mo old Gateway (even after downloading Roxio's ""new drivers"" patch (5.10k), and since this was one of the main reasons I updated from the free Version 5 s/w that came on my Gateway, I am very disappointed. I am standing by to get my 2nd email from Roxio tech support on this issue...This would seem to be at best a half-baked product. And I agree that the manual, even if some 200 p. long, is quite poorly written.For shame, Roxio (now Adaptec?)!"
1,Bad News --- And Dark Screen,"Had ECDC-5 Platinum on my machine, running WinME; worked okay. Upgraded to WinXP------NOTHING, not even with the download via cable modem! Try to reboot, and screen came on like it was going to die-----------very, very faint. Thank goodness that I created a 'restore point' just before the install attempt so I could have my computer back.I have a note into ROXIO; maybe they have a 'fix'???"
1,Worst episode ever...,"I give this product 1 star, only because I am unable to give it zero stars.If you are he11 bent on buying this software, please visit the support forum for ECDC5 first. You may save yourself a trip there later.Roxio has a tradition of blaming everyone ELSE when their software is exposed as incompatible. According to Roxio: Norton, Intel, and Microsoft are ALL to blame for ECDC's problems.For example, Roxio says that service pack 2 changes Windows 2000 so much, that it is a different operating system.This is from Intel's website:>After extensive investigation with Roxio of the 'Inaccessible Boot>Device' error message, we have found that the Intel Ultra ATA Storage>Driver is not the root cause of these incompatibilities.There is also a warning on Microsoft's website about the problems caused by ECDC, but I will leave it to you to muck about through that mess Microsoft calls a website.A little research might save you... a lot of grief."
1,Platinum 5 is a worthless product,Save your money and don't buy this version. Worthless product with millions of bugs. This is the worst update to this Product Ever. Total waste of money and very poor support.I had version 3.5c prior to this one and did not have any problems with it. Now that I have the 5.0 Platinum edition I don't seem to be able to perform a two drive copy. Can't finalize audio CD's. This is a major disappointment. My advice: Save yourself some grief and don't even consider this product.
1,"If you have XP, Easy is GARBAGE, GARBAGE, GARBAGE!!!","This is without a doubt the worst software upgrade in the history of CD software, from a software company whose cred was shaky to start with.I just upgraded to XP and subsequently had to upgrade to Roxio's Sleazy CD Destroyer 5 (Easy CD Creator 5) from version 4. While 4 has been *OK* for the past few years I have been running it, I can't say enough bad things about version 5 with XP. The software doesn't work... the patches for XP don't work... MS still won't put their seal of approval on it for good reason. It blew up numerous times for no apparent reason, it has no new functionality over v4, locks your system up repeatedly and slows it down to excruiciating levels, AND the UI is more poorly designed than in version 4.And you wonder why this product is 33% off retail?"
1,Lots of Problems with Windows 2000 and XP,"We had several machines with Windows 2000 and Windows XP with EASY CD Creator 5.0. Only about 20% did not have problems. We installed every patch and upgrade Roxio recommended. Bought all types of approved CDR media. All the CDR/CDRW drives were fully approved and popular brands. Once we moved to other CDR burning software , the problems went away. Many of the problems included stability problems, un-reliable CD recording, and general crashing. Removed Roxio products all the problems are gone."
1,Worst Product Ever,"I don't know what happend to Easy CD Creator, but after Roxio got ahold of it, they really ... it up. I have 4 burners in my company of various manufacturers. Easy CD only works on 3 of them. Fine. But after it didn't work on a brand new laptop, the uninstallation of the product hosed the system. THE COMPUTER WOULD NO LONGER BOOT. But don't believe me, just check out Microsofts website. KB article 810897. Furthermore, their current update still doesnt prevent this problem."
3,Terrible user's guide,I purchased Easy CD creator 5 platinum and have found that the user's guide is virtually useless. Even the tech at technical help agreed that they did not have good instructions. Be prepared to spend time and $ for tech help. They do not have a toll free phone number to call and I was on hold and with the tech today for over 1 hour! I would have tried something different if I would have realized all of this.
1,Lots of problems installing in XP & 2000,Don't waste your money. This product in not ready for XP or windows 2000. Have tried several times to get this program to work even after down loading updates. Nothing but crashes!!!!
1,Roxio doesn't rock!,"This product is extremly bloated and buggy. Nero Burning Rom has a simular feature set, is smaller, just as easy to use. And unlike Roxio is reliable."
1,Not very impressed,"I would have given it no stars if I could have!!I have run this software on three machines, and it performed badly on all of them. When I was running it on an HP I thought the problem was probably the computer. Then I upgraded to a Dell for my home use and a another Dell for the busniess. I was suprised to find Easy CD among the pre-packaged software. When I started experiencing problems (on both machines) I upgraded to the platinum version (thinking maybe it would be better). The software does not seem to be capable of consistently writting even the smallest file to my CD-RW drive (factory installed by Dell). It never ceases to amaze me that companies actually get away with selling a product with so many flaws. I would definetly recommend staying away from this product and by extension, any other product made by Roxio."
1,Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum,"Talking about shooting your self in the foot. This cd program is one of the worst on the market.1.) Compatibility issues are not addressed so a large number of cd-writers are not supported.2.) The program crashes often and you get cd under-burn errors 1 out of 4 times (you lose a lot of cds)3.) ...4.) DVD drives are not recognized by this program cause errors on the drive even when not using the program.So if you want to waste your money buy this program,"
1,Platinum? More like tin.,"I'm running Windows XP and was required to upgrade my CD burning software. So I take the plunge and purchase this software. What a mistake. Despite my downloading the patches for XP, the program would not work. In fact, it constantly crashed.I should have read the reviews first. I don't seem to be alone in my disappointed with this product.What really gets me is I cannot get a refund. Once one opens the package, that's it! You are stuck with it as Amazon will only replace it if it's faulty. The bottom line is it doesn't work.Personally I would avoid this software like the plague if you are running XP.Platinum...no Tin."
1,#1 Seller to novice buyers,"What Roxio doesn't tell you in their book but online in their secured support discussion section is that to load it with little problems, you must start all windows versions using the clean boot approach and modifying your registry. This is not a job for a novice computer user. Best advice look else where for cd burnering."
1,Avoid with Windows 2000,"This program trashed my registry, and would not run at all. I've tried all updates and recommendations on the Roxio site, and have had no luck.Buy something useful like Nero Burning if you want software that works with Windows 2000.I would give this product a -5 if I could, since it claims to work with Windows 2000, and most certainly does not work with my installation."
1,not what they claim,"I just bought this worthless product about 2 days ago,after spending about 2hours on the phone with these people, just to have them tell me that the VIEDOIMPRESSION part of the softwear does not do what it says it will do. they sent me to the company that makes the program and I got the same answer. They said that thet new of the problem but have not done anything about it. Please people do not buy this product and want to record your digital movies on cd because you can't."
1,CD Creator 5.0,"I have using CD Creator 4 for a long time and loved it.CD creator 5 compare to the 4 is not worth installing, it simply does not do a complete job.Amazon returns is not fair by refunding only half the price charged for unsatisfactory merchandise.The Cd creator advertise was 5.0 for XP and the package came marked 5 for 98-ME.PS The star was needed to send this review. Even Compaq tech. could not help me."
1,Probably a great program-IF you don't have XP,"This program has caused me more grief. It just won't work with XP! Roxio can't even get it together to sell off the shelf a program that is XP compatible, and even with the latest 5.3.1 patch it won't work. Roxio, you're getting this program back! I should sue you for the time it has cost me!"
1,Piece of Junk,"I cant believe how a company that created Easy CD creator 4.0 can trash it so badly in the sequel.I have wasted a perfectly good sat afternoon installing this beast with the following headaches:1. Try to add tracks from a CD to the playlist and it just sits there forever..2. Tried another laptop and it gives me a error saying cannot create ...,when I start up Easy CD Creator3. soundstream just sits there initializing....4. Tried another and the machine wont shut downAnd its a HOG. It takes up over 200 M and it has to be installed on the boot drive. for those of us who have factory defined 2 G boot partitions are SOL.Yes I agree with another reviewer. This product WAS NEVER TESTED."
1,Disappointed,"After trying the Easy Cd Creator 5.0 plus Windows XP patch and an upgrade on two computers, I removed it from both computers. Performance was slow and very unreliable for my purposes. ... After removing and trying to reload, I was confronted with loading problems. All I can say is NOT RECOMMENDED!"
5,Just as I expected!,"This software is excellent, I don't know why there are so many complaints out there about this product, must be people not following instructions correctly or something. I just purchased it to replace my old Easy CD Creator 4 basic that originally came with my CD burner last year. This new version is awesome. It also works flawlessly in every aspect of the program. I would recommend it to anyone, and would not own any other CD burning program. Easy CD Creator is just that, Easy and it is loaded with wonderful features. Happy Burning!"
1,"Where oh where did my download go, where...","I have had adaptec Easy CD Creator 3.5 ever since i had a CD-RW drive, now i cant find a download. So i get 99 dollars saved up and send it for easy cd creator 5 delux, well, turns out it aint that delux after all, i cant even get it to burn a mp3 file yet."
1,Alex's Review,I do not care for this product. It makes backing up your hard drive info extremely difficult. Too many processes.
5,Gnarly burning software,"This is a sick product...for anyone my age I say you gotta buy it. It's really really easy..i mean seriously, if I can use it anyone can. It like does everything for you. I say if you're anything like me and not too handy with a computer, buy this."
1,IT SUCKS,"FIRST I HAVE CREATOR 4. IT WAS AND STILL IS SOLD AS ""JUST LIKE YOUR ZIP DRIVE BUT BIGGER AND FASTER"". WRONG!!. WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO MAKE A DATA CD WITH DIFFERENT FILES AND NOT BE ABLE TO UPDATE OR CHANGE THE FILES? I FOUND OUT AFTER BUYING IT THAT IT IS A ""READ ONLY THING"" WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT??????????IT CAN ONLY BE READ AND NOT CHANGED. WHAT KIND OF CRAP IS THAT. I HAVE TO ERASE THE WHOLE CD EITHER DATA OR AUDIO TO CHANGE ADD OR DELETE THE DISK. IT IS NOT FOR ANYONE WANTING TO USE IT AS A BACK UP AT ALL. WHY HAVE A REWRITE AT ALL??? THE PRICE OF A R IS CHEAP SO YOU CAN JUST BUY AND MAKE A NEW ONE EACH TIME YOUR INFORMATION CHANGES (WHICH YOU HAVE TO DO ANYHOW)INFORMATION CHANGES BUT NOT YOUR CD. THIS PROGRAM SUCKS."
3,DO NOT BUY IF YOU OWN Windows 2000 or XP,"I give this product 5 stars when it works. However, I give it 1 star for the problem I will describe below. (Hence 3 star average.)I installed the software and it worked great for 3 months. Then one day it told me that no compatible recorders were installed on my system. After 5 days of reloading software and hardware I still could not use it.I found this fix [...] on the Roxio web site but I don't feel I should have to do all this every time the software has a hiccup.Now I have to buy Easy CD Creator 6 because it, apparently, does not have these issues. I still feel cheated though.[...]"
1,i install it in one day and I deleted the next one......,it cost to much money and putting the word delicate.....it sudd iam glad i was able to return it and get my money back.........
1,Roxio misrepresents this product,"This product is supposed to be used in Windows Me and Windows XP. With Windows Me I could never get the Windows Media Player to connect with the Easy Creator 5.0 Platinum. I E-mailed Roxio which I have not heard from them yet. This is August 3, 2002 and I bought this thing June 29, 2002. After changing to Windows XP Home Edition I found that the computer reported that Roxio Creator 5.0 is not compatible. I tried to install it anyway into the Windows XP. Roxio Creator reported it could not find the controls so I tried to cancel the installation. I could not cancel because the computer finished installing. Then I tried to format a CD which I received the message that there was no CD Recorder connected to my computer. I have the Windows Media Player Recorder. My advice is to save your money and don't buy this misrepresented merchandise. I wish I could rate this product -10."
1,No doubt it's the WORST,"I've been using this software for 1 year and its rate ofsuccessful burning has been only 80%. It causes deadlock all ofthe time. Yestoday after I uninstalled it, my win2000 nolonger can boot up. Seems some system files were damaged.D-a-m-n.Only after I had a try on Nero5.5 today did I realize thathow bad EZ Creator is. I'll never touch roxio products again."
1,"Still waiting for ""Out-of-the-box"" capability for Windows XP","When a person pays more than [$] for any software that says it is Windows XP capable, then it really should work without having to go to the internet and getting an upgrade. As long as Windows XP has been around, ...should have been able to produce there wares to work with it. Based upon personal experience, be advised to wait until [they] develops a version of Easy-CD-Creator for Windows XP"
1,I wish I could give this ZERO stars,"I wish I could pay another...and get back the time i've wasted on this garbage. Ever since installing Easy CD Creator, my XP machine has been plagued with random crashes and errors. After trying unsuccessfully to burn a CD, the first thing I did was install the WinXP patches on the Roxio site. Big mistake! After patching, my machine would crash before it even finished booting. It took me almost an hour holding for tech support, an emailed file, and booting off the XP cd in ""recovery mode"" to get my machine back to a working state. Its a shame that this software's quality is so terrible, because the user interface is actually quite decent.From what I understand, Easy CD Creator works quite well under Win98- but don't try using it with Win2k or XP unless you are a glutton for punishment."
2,Upgrading caused problems,"I first was introduced to the Easy CD Creator as a bundled trialware when I recieved my Dell Laptop in the mail. I was pleased with the basic version. It's interface is very easy and there is virtually no learning curve. I thought this was finally the CD burner I had dreamed of owning. Online, I ordered away for the platinum but found that version didn't recognize the Toshiba CD-RW. I went online to download the appropiate driver update and installed it succesfully, but with no change in result (as if it had never installed). (...) I know I'll love the product if I can ever get it to work.(...)"
1,AWFUL,"PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS LEFT BY MANY PEOPLE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ARE COMPLETELY TRUE. SYSTEM CRASHES, BUGS, TERRIBLE TECH. SUPPORT AND EVEN THE INTERFACE IS NOT EVEN STYLISH.THIS PRODUCT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY, CD-R'S /CD-RW'S AND MOST IMPORTANT ... TIME.IF THERE WAS A 0 STAR, I WOULD SUBMIT IT WITH COMPLETE HAPPINESS."
1,Crashes instead of Burns,"No software I have ever used for any purpose has caused so many crashes on my computer with Windows ME. Twice, the only way I could fix the mess was to reinstall Windows. Stay as far away as you can from this one!"
4,I like it,"Despite all the potential technical problems with a product like that, it worked perfectly for me. My understanding is that there are a number of incompatibility issues but my copy came bundled with the computer and works great. I don't think the Platinum edition is a must - the ability to burn music on the CD is available as an add-on for the standard edition too - you can download it from the developer's site.Best way to back up data and carry large files arround."
3,Recording Speeds,"I had set my expectations of the EZ5 a little higher than the package was able to deliver. I still get 'skips' at high speed settings, (CD to CD) with all running backgrounds turned off (windows 98). The feature I bought the software for works, (the slide show with audio). Although it wasn't as easy as a 'plug and play' software should be, I did have to use the Tech Support to get this feature to work. The bottom line for me is, if you want to add some features to your burner, get this, just don't expect it to jump through the proverbial hoops......."
2,Buggy,"It all began when I migrated to Win 2000.Attempting to add multiple files via the add button hangs the program. The worst occurs with packeting (Direct CD) operations. Writing multiple files crashes the OS beyond recovery (a remarkable accomplishment with Win 2000) and ruins the disk.The 5.3.2 patch didn't help and the only more recent update is billed only as adding drive support.Too bad -- ECDC has a lot going for it: nice intuitive interface, a label creator, with a collection of exceptionally artistic and original background themes, that generally seems well-behaved. However, this is really inexcusable as neither Win 2000 or ECDC are new products."
1,If at first you succeed...,"...stop while you're ahead.Here's the deal: the software worked duckily the first few times on XP. Then, suddenly, when I was in a hurry to burn something for a long drive - plink! She breaks.Do yourself a favor, purchase Nero 5. It works, and that's what we all buy software for, isn't it? Lalalalala."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm running Windows 2000 Pro and my new computer came with Roxio basic installed. I tried that, liked it and ordered Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum. It developed into one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had with a program. On first installation the program wouldn't work correctly so I followed the instructions, downloaded the updates and started over. It still didn't work correctly. After a half-dozen tries I gave up and reinstalled the basic version. Now the basic version doesn't work correctly.To top it off, I didn't get any paperwork to process the rebate and it cost me the full price to throw it away."
1,The Worst Software Ever,"... Words cannot describe how bad this is. I see a lot of folks have noted major issues with Windows XP. But I have had all the same problems and more with Windows 2000: system crashes, slow performance, incomplete shutdowns. And no, you don't even need to be using the program to experience these issues. Installing it alone will do the damage. On top of that, the interface and logic of the program are poorly thought out (I only know this have been able to use previous versions of this, to an extent.) In compiling a CD project, if the program fails to read one disc (which it does often), the whole project must be scrapped. This program goes beyond useless and is actually a threat to the health of any operating system. People keep buying it because the basic version comes bundled with many systems, the packaging is slick, and it continues to be given prominent shelf space in retail stores, and prominent promotion on the web. Do not be fooled. This is poison."
1,Not as Adverstised,"After several years of satisfactory service from Adaptec's EZ CD, version 3, I purchased Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum when I upgraded to Windows 2000.Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum is (STILL) advertised as being compatible with Win 2000 but IT IS NOT.After several phone calls to Roxio Support, they finally admitted that this is the case but have no idea if and when a fix will be available.I applied for a refund, an application they accepted graciously, and am looking elswhere for a usable product.Amamzon should remove this erroneous advertising."
1,Do Not Attempt this Product with Windows XP,"I loaded this software and both the patches that Roxio claims work with XP, and the first CD I burned could only be read on another CD writer, even after I finished the CD. It then crashed my whole system. I had to re-install my entire operating system. This product is dangerous if you are an XP user."
1,What a pile of ...,"After buying into they hype of this being an improvement of version 4.0 I bought version 5.0 platnium. What a waste of money. They couldn't pay me enough to use this software. When I tried to access the support, they told me that they were working on a patch, but in the last 6 months no patch has ever become available. If you can find other software, use it. Roxio laid an egg with this one."
1,Easy CD Destroyer 5.0 Rust,"I am one of those idiots who buy software first and thenread the reviews. This time, it hit me right in theeye. Easy CD Creator 5.0 ""Platinum"" (what else?) turnedout to be a nightmare. After wasting nearly $100, twohours, three blank CD-Rs, I did the right thing and satdown to read the reviews. I concur with all those who ratethis software with one star and can't understand thosewho recommend it. I think Amazon should add a ""0 star""rating for occasions such as this.My advise: stay away from this sofware and don't eventhink of trying it on your Windows XP PC.Now it remains to be seen if Amazon will refund mymoney, if not my exasperation."
1,Don't buy it if you value your computer,"This product is better than a virus for trashing your system. I was running Windows 2000 (with SP1) and loaded this. After I loaded it, I did not restart my computer, but used the software to create a CD, which it did. When I rebooted I could only get halfway through the Win2k spash screen when the whole system locked up. I did a hard restart and the same thing happened. I could not get back to my system so I had to reformat my hard disk and reinstall win2k. I got Win2k up and running again and in a fit of stupidity/curiousity I reinstalled Easy CD Creator 5 Platnium and the patch from Roxio which supposedly corrects this problem, with the exact same lockup result. I am in the process of reinstalling Win2k now, but this product is sitting with my piles of old AOL disks, never to be used. Unless you like testing software, don't buy this product (and don't let anyone give it to you for free)."
1,Sorry I Bought This,"Sorry, but this software works poorly with Windows XP (1 gHz Pentium3, 512 mb RAM). Copying a CD, it trashes the blank nearly half the time, even at 2X speed, nothing else running. If CD has 9 tracks or more, it reads 9th and succeeding tracks about 1/4 speed. I defrag often. Upgrades are of no help. Poor customer support. Also had trouble when using Windows me. Review of their web site shows other customers having many problems also; fixes often not available even for persisting problems."
1,A disappointed Roxio fan gives up on V5,Don't waste your time or money. If you are running W2k or XP this software will not do half of what it says it will. The updates and fixes on the website DO NOT WORK! i spent hours following their instructions and downloading updates and fixes - and i still get the same errors. There's too many bugs and they're way too difficult to fix. i've been a fan of ez cd creator since it was 2.0 - and i've never been so dissatisfied until now. i made the switch to nero and hopefully things will be better.
1,Research hard before you waste your hard earned dollars!,"My issue with the software is when you burn from a cd to MP3, itcreates a permanent digital background. Even if you attempt to convert it back to wav or a higher quality mp3 it retains the noise! This is the function that I paid [price] for! What a waste of money! Research hard before you waste your hard earned dollars... Save your money DO NOT BUY ROXIO PRODUCTS ...---> Easy cd creator!!!!..."
1,DONT BUYIT,"I tried to use easy cd creator 5.0 platinum in windows XP and it burn a cd perfect with no preoblems but tha problem was that the cd was unreadable, then when I turn the computer off and then turned back on it gave me an error messege and i had to reinstall everything , this software made me lost about 2000 mp3 and 30 gb of movies I wil NOT RECOMEND this software is you are using windows XP it will crash your computer"
2,Problems,"I purchased Easy Creator Platinum specifically to put digital photos on a CD. However, every time I try I get an OLE error message. I tried to e mail Roxio and my passwork will not work--even tried reregistering. Then I called long distance at my expence and a man walked me through many changes to my computer for 1/2 hour. When I reinstalled it, the same thing happens. No one knows what OLE error means. And now I can't return it."
1,Version is not compatible with WinXP,"The advertising of this version is simply wrong. The first screen to appear when installing on an XP machine, is that ""it is not compatible"". Beware."
5,Angel sent from heaven,"It has been really great watching Highway to Heaven. Michael Landon is the best actress of old times. The movies are for kids also, parents dont have to worry about their kids learning anything they shouldnt. Watching these movies, has really changed me and my family. An Angel sent to help people in need, and to really change their life, is what lifes all about. What a great ending."
3,I love the series BUT I thought I bought the whole first season??,"I clicked on the 1cd option for the season.. I thought that maybe they were all put on one cd.. I should have known better, so my mistake:/ Got the whole series later and will donate this to our church library."
3,Not Quite Complete,"The previous review from Joanne Chisholm does a nice job covering anything I could possibly say about what is included on the cd. I agree with all she says. This is a nice collection of Daltrey's song, but I only give it three stars because it does leave out a couple great songs and does not include anything from Daltrey's last album, Rocks in the Head. The subsequent Moonlighting collection is much more complete and diverse, and I do admit that my rating for this cd is partly based on a comparison to that compilation."
2,"looks good, feels not so good","This looks like a decent black leather couch, but once you sit on it, you realize why it's not so expensive. It is hard and uncomfortable, and the recliner control needs help -- i.e. you need to kick the chair back to make it recline. This is a decent couch for a room that you don't plan to hang out in, but not a good lounger couch for your main living room."
2,ok,"this book has many illistrations, however, they are difficult to understand and many are pages away from in info being discussed, also this book requires a strong anatomy background"
1,I never even received the book.,I emailed the seller saying that I haven't received the book and he never even replied to me. It has been more than a month since i bought the book and I still haven't received neither a reply from the seller nor the book itself.
4,"Concise, comprehensive, and clinical","Good book. Better than Langeman's (SP?), which is just a bunch of droning about pathways. This is more developmental biology on a macro level."
1,Quite possibly the worst text I have ever owned.,"Although the information in the book is extensive, the organization makes it quite difficult to learn. The publisher would do themselve a favor to reorganize the book such that diagrams are readily available with the corresponding text, and to supply more thorough labels. There are typos in the book; unacceptable for any medical text."
2,A compilation of errors: textual and graphical,"I am a medical student at Texas A&M USHSC COM. This text is one of the worst I have ever owned. It is wrought with errors. There are numerous errors in the text. The diagrams are confusing and many are actually wrong. The wordy nature of the book is also a problem for most medical students, as the yield appears to be low (unlike Moore's: Clinically Oriented Anatomy). This text is listed as a required text at many medical schools, however, it should not be. Instead, I suggest *Langman's Medical Embryology. This is a much better choice for all interested in a clear and correct understanding of clinical embryology."

1,No information about what's in this book,"There are 17 reviews to date. The majority, 13 (or 76%) are from reviewers in North Carolina which happens to be where the author is based. All 13 NC reviewers gave the book perfect 5 star reviews. All 13 claim the techniques are great, but none go into details about the contents of the books - like specific sales techniques. It doesn't help that there's no ""Look Inside"" the book feature available, also no editorial reviews. You have no information about what's in this book. If you buy it, you're basically buying it on hype. That is, you're buying it just because everyone said it was great without knowing the specifics about why it was great. That's fine if that's how you buy books. I like to stick to substance so will pass on this one."
3,Look before you buy,"I guess it wasn't what I was looking for. It has basic information, but I needed more details. I wanted to know more about dehydrating frozen veggies. It was ok, but I should have looked though it at my local bookstore before deciding to make the purchase."
2,Dehydrator reference,"This book is very old. I am interested in raw foods and healthy organic foods. I recognize that drying my own is one way to keep it healthy. And this book is about that, in the 1980's."
2,hmmm,"a bit old school... good for the basics but if you want to become a raw foodie and make some fantasic food dont bother, this is like a book from the 70s and just doesnt kick it for raw food lovers today... if this is what your after dont bother..."
2,Too advanced for me,"I thought this book would be very basic, but it was a bit too complicated for a first time deydrator. It was too detailed and a bit overwhelming. The book starts with a brief history of food drying, then chp 2 explains how they work, chp 3 discusses basic facts about dehydration. I just wanted a quick and dirty look at the hows not the whys of food dehydration. This book would be excellent for the more advanced or the historical interested person."
3,fairly descriptive,again pictures would have been helpful and more about temperatures and prep for variious vegetables but was basically informative for me
5,Awesome Seller!,Awesome Seller! Item arrived exactly as described. Will do business with this seller again!
2,Mary Bells complete dehydrator cookbook,"This book is good, but one thing I wanted to do was as natural as possible. Maybe need to read into it a bit more"
3,Okay Book,"I was honestly hoping for more when I purchased this book...The booklet that came with my dehydrator just about covered everything that was in this book, there are a couple worthwhile recipes and tips though that make it an okay purchase.The author is all over the place which makes it a little hard to follow at times. The book itself is a nice hard cover edition,I like that."
3,Not That Complete,"I wasn't terribly impressed with Mary Bell's Complete Dehydrator Cookbook. As a matter of fact, I think the little booklet that came with my Nesco Dehydrator had more detailed information. This book is useful for general information and there are some recipes in the back to help you use your dehydrated items but I found it lacking real information, it's more of a compilation of ""tips."". This book does give of an overview of the dehydrating process, choosing the right machine and the basic items you can use. If you're looking for detailed recipes for making more than jerky and what the water content of different fruits and vegetables, I say ""keep looking."""
5,A dehydrator's must have book!,"I absolutely love this book! If you own a dehydrator you aren't using it to it's fullest potential until you use the recipes and tips in this book, TRUST ME! I thought I was making good use of mine until I came across Mary Bell's book and now I am using my dehydrator all year long; for camping, snacks, crafts, pet treats, my own herbs and sauces, I even make my own tofu jerky!"
5,Highly recommend,I highly recommend this book for your shelf if you are serious about being self reliant. I even learned a few things I didn't know.
3,DRY,"Ok...this book is rather dry. But, she gives all the information you will need to dehydrate foods yourself, as well as store them. Not too bad."
5,This book is a MUST HAVE if you want to start dehydrating food.,"This woman can write efficiently and to the point. With any instructional book this is crucial. There are a couple of chapters dedicated to the benefits and history of dehydrating food, but they are interesting, brief and well written. The best thing about this book is that the index is EXTREMELY comprehensive. If you have a new veggie score from the farmers market and you want to get to work right away you can easily flip to the back and get the pages you need.Mary Bell is a master of her craft - I have tried her techniques with perfect success every time.This is one of the most well written How-To books I have ever read. If you have a dehydrator that is collecting dust, or if you are shopping for one - go ahead and pick it up - this will get you started in moments, and answer any questions you might have about the process of food dehydration."
2,Misleading,"I was excited to receive this book after reading the reviews. Once I received it, I was disappointed with the recipes. It states that it is a complete dehydrator cookbook, but there is no temperatures & times in a lot of the recipes. Was not satisfied with this purchase."
1,Cristalle - .13 oz eau de parfum sold by Beauty Encounter,"The product that I received is marked clearly on the back ""not for sale"" and was probably made as a sample. Judging by the smell it is way out of date and therefore has lost it's original lovely light fragrance. I do not think this company should be selling samples. Nor should they be selling perfume that is out of date."
1,product not what was stated,A disappointment as I have had exceedingly great results from the rest of my Chanel products. This was NOT Chanel. It was not even a decent fake.
5,Very easy to use,"This camcorder far exceeded my expectations and is very easy and simple to use. The Mini-DV media is by far the highest quality and JVC offers Sony-like quality at an affordable price. The remote control feature makes playback very convenient. The media card allows for a quick transfer of digital still shots to your PC and ultimately to the WEB. The video allows for 1/60 second editing (firewire is recommended for this) as well as a variety of frame transitioning options. Very lightweight and easy to use. After many different purchases over the last 10 years, JVC has not let me down."
2,Please Save Your Money!,"This is an unofficial dvd, its not represented by Christina or her management.Theres no music by Christina! Why? This is not an official dvd, Christina's music is copyrighted so they cannot include any.They show a video of her singing live...with no sound! Instead theres instrumental music.Its not really a biograpghy, its mostly opinions of the couple of people they asked. It was horrible, they had no creative thoughts and repeated themsleves!The pictures they used were terrible quality and seemed to be played around with and streached out! Even though it says on the dvd box there is rare photos, there are none.I gave it 2 stars because they did show an interview with Chrisitna talking about her album Stripped. Other then that this documentry is rubbish."
1,A complete sham,"Yes, I am way, way over thirteen and a big Christina Aguilera fan. I can't help myself.I actually rate this item a minus 6 stars but that option was not available.This DVD is a joke - a bad joke. Spend your money on ANYTHING else."
1,The WORSTof the WORST DVDs!!!!!!!,"I am really a Christina fan but I have no choice on this one other than saying the truth. This is the WORST DVD I have ever bought in my life. I can't encourage anyone to buy this one. I don't really know what Christina was thinking to release this DVD. There is no way I can call this a music video but rather call it a ""SLIDE DVD"" coz what you should expect to see are just slides about her biography and no music at all. I regret having bought this DVD. I repeat, DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!! This is really discouraging. Anyway if you have nothing to do with your money then you can buy this one. Better buy the Stripped one not this one."
1,delrio,"Oh my God! I'm looking for anything less than 1 star...Anyone who has seen this DVD has got to be soooooo disappointed! I really love Christina (just ask my girlfriend) and to watch this DVD was tooooo much to bare! Five minutes into it and I screamed ""I GOT RIPPED OFF""! ""WARNING""...""DO NOT BUY THIS DVD""!!! The only thing positive about the ordeal was I didn't purchase it online @ ""AMAZON.COM""! :) If I had used my account I would have been forwarned by all you great ""AMAZON.COM MEMBERS""...I would have saved a few bucks and shed less tears! It was total torture!!!"
4,this dvd is great!,"i just bought this dvd when it was released. it's so awesome! it has all these cool and sexy pics of christina aguiulera, and past interviews. it also features all of her music videos that she has done so far! i would reccomend this dvd to anyone who is a christina aguilera fan!"
4,Really gets you moving,"It's hard not to like this reggae music. It has a mix of original songs and favorites with a new twist. I first heard this at a ski repair shop and asked the clerk what it was. The shop employees really got into their work when it was on, he told me. I listen to this a lot when I'm working on my computer and I don't get tired of it. It makes your body move."
1,"A book with an interesting thesis, but very poor science.","This book begins with the thesis that the immune system has elements of good and bad, depending on the situation. This is an excellent starting point and one I use often with my classes. However, Dr. Lappe does not have the depth of knowledge he needs to make me want to read further. Technically incorrect statements (for example, Herpes virus is an RNA virus and IgE has 4 antigen binding sites) degrade the import of his ideas. I cannot recommend this book to my students or the lay public, because of Lappe's basic science errors. In addition, these errors may cause the scientific community to disregard important ideas that are needed to to bring western allopathic medicine closer to the healing traditions found in eastern and native cultures."
2,Not good for a beginner,"I got this book because I was interested in learning more about Tao -- my only experience had been the Tao of Pooh. This is probably a good book if you know about Tao and the philosophy behind it, but as a newcomer, it wasn't interesting or educational."
5,One of the best current translations of Chuang Tzu.,"All readers, both professional scholars and general auditory, interested in Taoist Philosophy may enjoy having this translation from the Classical Chinese text of the book of Chuang Tzu. Most of poetical parts of the original text have been translated with keeping the beauty of the original. This book is an important tool for deeper understanding of Philosophical Taoism."
5,"Wow, impresive!","I had previously been using a VGA cord for my monitor, but as I recently upgraded my video card, and I have an LED monitor, I figured it would be worth it to get a DVI cord. Boy was I right, there is an immediate NOTICABLE different, and this cord carries the signal well. It's pretty short though, so if your monitor is far away from your computer, this might not work well, but for me, it's perfect, because there is less cord to get tangles up everywhere. It's nice and thick, and it seems as though it will stand up to the test of time."
5,Awesome,"It is unbelievable how many people are getting robbed, I mean really robbed, by not taking the time and listening to this guy sing. I first heard Chuck Carrier sing as an opening act for Collective Soul while I stationed in Korea. This guy has pure TALENT.Do yourself a favor; get this album ""Songs for 27."" You will not regret it."
5,Yum-yum!,"I love this book -- the recipes are simple, yet flavorful. Homemade peanut butter w/ chili pepper? New and different -- definitely adds a kick to same ol', same ol'.I liked the anecdotal info, too, and the (very) brief history of Caribbean cuisine."
5,Love This Book,"This book has a lot of staples that I grew up eating when visiting my grandparents out in Long Island. I know I will never cook the way my grandmother cooked, but I can put my own spin on the food. I am looking forward to creating wonderful dishes that represent my grandmother's culture."
4,The most controversial NT passages Explained!!!,"This book, written by Rabbi Harvey Falk, is a MUST HAVE for EVERYONE, whether believer or skeptic! The most controversial passages recorded in the NT are put into 1st century perspective.Although I disagree with the rabbis perspective in the book that Yeshua and Saul came to bring a message of only the Noahide commandments to the Gentile world, the documentation presented is definitely worth the $$$ value being asked for this research.Without this authors explanation regarding the ""satanic passages"" mentioned in the NT, Christians, Nazarenes and Jews will not be able to grasp Yeshua's most shocking statements!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product. It was not what I thought I was buying. I don't know if I did not check what it was thoroughly enough or not, but I have no use for this very expensive pamphlet."
4,Encyclopedia of Fluid Mechanics: Complex Flow Phenomena and,This is a good book for modelling of turbulent flows.
4,Great deal,Loved all the TV music on this CD. I would have given it a 5 star but there were several songs missing which then meant I had to buy another CD. I made a DVD movie/slide show using alot the songs on this cd. I even listen to it in my car on my way to work....
3,Newsradio? Third Rock?,"While some of the themes included in this collection are questionable (Saved by the Bell?), the biggest omission seems to be the themes from ""Newsradio"" and ""Third Rock from the Sun."" I've NEVER seen either one of these themes available anywhere other than file sharing services like Kazaa and Limewire. To me, the ""Newsradio"" theme is one of the all time greats but good luck finding it!"
1,ITEM IS COPY PROTECTED!! :(,"This CD has all of the great tv soundtrack hits on it. I would have given it five stars. However, it is copy-protected. It won't even play in a computer, must least Rip. This is very annoying. I paid for the CD, and would like to Rip it to my music library so that I do not have to dig out the CD everytime I want to see if I have a particular song, or to listen to a song. Why do these companies do this. Don't they realize that if a person really wants to commit a crime for money they will find a way around these ""systems"". I am a law abiding citizen and I just want to digitize material that I paid for, for my own use. Like a previous reviewer said, they are only limiting the sales and enjoyment of their music."
3,tv show themes,Not as good as i thought it would be. Lots of songs missing. Original on all songs? Don't think so.
4,Great camcorder for the money,"My husband and I bought this camcorder to make short films for competition and we were very happy with it. The picture quality is excellent both indoors and out. The sound is good but it tends to pick up a lot of echo in large indoor spaces. It doesn't eat up battery power (which was a concern) and is very easy to use. The night-alive feature was a disappointment though... as the others have said it makes your subjects blurry and appear in slow motion. Overall, we love this camera and are very pleased with its performance."
3,The great Japanese pastime,"This book has nice pictures of vintage Japanese baseball cards and informative text. But the cover fell off of my book while I was reading it! A minor complaint, perhaps, but I thought I should mention it."
4,Great soundtrack but the best fight track missing,"This isn't a 'proper' review but I just wanted to let people know that arguably one of the best tracks is not on this disc. It was actually most of the reason I got this and I found every memorable song except that one. Huge letdown. The song is one that plays during fights (especially towards the end of the series, including the last fight) and it features somewhat slow heavy guitar riffs."
2,Not very interesting story,"The Spider-Man novel series started to decline in story quality and it started with this novel. The Lizard tries nothing new in the story except try to destroy his human alter-ego Dr. Curt Connors (been there, done that), take over the world with a band of intelligent lizards (been done on the animated series already) and peter parker must find him and stop him before it's too late. The action is too rushed, the plot is never developed to the extent that it becomes interesting, and the end is very anti-climactic. I can't reccomand this book."
2,Wings of Fire,"After having devoted my time and attention to what I had hoped would be an interesting sequal to Todd's first Rutledge mystery, I was very disappointed. Unanswered were the questions, Why interview the townsfolk and not let the reader know what they said (was the interview process even relevant?); why didn't the principals who knew the murderer's identity for DECADES never go to the constables and identify him/her; and what was the motivation for suicide?"
2,"I wanted to like it, but...","The author should have the exclamation point removed from his keyboard. Half of the characters sound like hysterics, with their dialogue punctuated this way. I agree with the other reviewer who was irritated by the interview, re-interview, re-re-interview. I wanted to like the idea of Hamish, but ultimately wasn't willing to put up with characters who were jittery and indignant all the time, coupled with plot details that were telegraphed. Maybe this works for someone new to British detectives, but it was a slog for me."
4,unusual,"This makes a interresting varient to the need of an investigator for someone to talk to. As a device it helps move things along for the reader if information is revealed in conversation rather than entirely by narrative. In this case the ""sidekick"" is not a subordinate but a voice in the Inspector's head. It is not clear if we are to believe Hamish is a real ghost or an artifact of injury, yet when he calls attention to a shotgun the Inspector has not noticed, it does seem a separate entity.Nancy Atherton's Aunt Dimity series and Cleo Coyle's GHOST AND MRS. McCLURE leave no doubt what they intend, and their creators are restricted to special contact situations. Inspector Rutledge's companion, being in his head, is infinitely portable.My first acquaintance with this series was THE RED DOOR. When I had the opportunity to acquire the first three books of the series, I was glad to do so. This story makes an interresting sideways jump at the end."
2,"I'm done, unfortunately","After an encouraging start to this series, the second installment struck me as over-long, listless and disappointing. I will not be moving on to the next book. The historical context becomes largely unimportant and the aspects of the detective's war trauma does little to provide empathy. I was hoping for more; I thought it would never end. It was different type of consumer good I would ask for my money back."
3,"""Wings"" a disappointment","I had very high hopes for the second ""Rutledge"" novel after reading the first. As I wended my way through the thickets of overblown writing and multilayered plotting, compounded with melodramatic thunderstorms at every turn, I thought, ""where is the simplicity and clarity that so swept me up in the first story? Rutledge was marvelously brought to life in the first novel; please bring him back!"""
4,As addictive as laudanum...,"Gorgeously written, psychologically complex and historically dead-on. Shell-shocked, haunted and full of self-doubt, Rutledge won my heart in the first ten pages. (Haimish too!)"
4,The story continues,"In this sequel to ""A Test of Wills"", Todd continues his psychological explorations into the damaged mind of Ian Rutledge while at the same time creating a more complex scenario in which to demonstrate his superior (and unconventional) detection skills."
2,When will it end?,"Inspector Ian Rutledge is an unbelievably poor detective and this narrative is pure contrivance. Although the descriptive detail at times is quite lovely, the plot plods along painfully. Any number of times I wanted that spectral voice of Hamish to shout out, ""Get on with it, Rutledge!"" The denouement was hilarious and melodramatic, which actually replicated a good deal of the ""action"" in the novel.I could not empathize with any of these characters because their inner motivations were never established. They were caricatures serving a poorly conceived plot. So many of Rutledge's decisions were utterly bad from a police procedural point of view. I am glad that I haven't read these novels in sequence because if I had begun with this one, I would never have read the other three that I have.Exhausting reading!"
4,Don't buy the Kindle edition...,"unless typos and errors don't faze you. It does bother me, and the Kindle edition reads like it was scanned from the printed text and then never proofed. These are errors like what you would find in a Project Gutenberg book that you were reviewing in its first pass. ""I""s become ""1""s, the justification wanders all over the place.I've given it 4 stars for the novel, but if I were able to give it stars for the proofing, it would only be 1 star. The text carries you along breathlessly until all of a sudden, the detective ""stands in a Norway"" and you pull up with a bump.If you want to read it, buy a paper edition instead. I hope it's better proofed."
2,Very Disappointed,"We were very disappointed with this fax machine for two reasons. First, it uses these annoying cartridge ribbons, and it uses a LOT of them. They are very expensive and don't last long at all. The low price of the machine doesn't make up for the high price of the ribbons. Second, the thing broke after only 2 1/2 months of use. The ribbon got itself so jammed up a piece actually broke off inside, making it so we can no longer send a fax. I would only recommend this in a very low use situation."
4,A simple fax for simple purposes,"I wanted to get an inexpensive all-in-one fax/copy/answering machine as a Christmas gift for my parents. It needed to be easy to use, it needed to use plain paper, and the replacement ink needed to be a reasonable price. This machine provided each of these for my parents. They are not very technically proficient, yet my father had it setup in about 15 minutes. They only receive or send about 1 fax a week, so it's an answering machine first, and a fax second. It's been a few months now, and I have not heard any complaints from them. I call that a success!"
2,"Easy to use, Poor quality answering machine","After fussing with the film cartridge for about 15 minutes in the store, I decided that the floor model suffered some abuse and that this would not be a problem for my home/office. I bought the machine, set it up, and began testing it. Very easy to set up and made good quality copies. I recorded my voice message for the answering machine and sounded like I was in a sewer (echo, mumbly sound). This is not the quality machine I want when people call my business. I returned it and am shopping for a better quality answering machine, even if it means having a separate stand-alone fax machine."
1,Very poor quality,"I have had a KX-FP155 for about 4 years. Paper misfeeds were a problem from the beginning. Print quality is poor, at best. The ink film is expensive and tends to get wrinkled. Now, after using it less than 50 times total, it is apparently worn out. Neither paper feeder works at all."
5,Great fax for home office,"We needed to receive faxes in our home office, and this machine was a great solution. It has a built-in answering machine, and stores up to 50 phone numbers. Print quality is fine, it is easy to set-up, and easy to receive both phone and fax calls on the same line. Recommended for a home office situation."
5,Ryka Women's GCB Walking Shoe,"Ryka Women's GCB Walking ShoeGreat comfortable shoe, this is the only shoe I want to wear, just need more colors otherwise great product, comfort along with support needed and really nice looking shoe. Great price."
1,Shoes breaking down or something,"These shoes are hardly worn by me, I use them on occasional weekends. The heel is making a weird noise, like I am walking on crystals. It is distracting. I contacted the company to get a return email telling me how my money won't be returned, the shoes will not be returned if it is determined the shoe is not manufacturally defective, how I need my original receipt, etc etc. It is interesting. How about an email telling me how they would like to take a look at the shoe and then give me the negative spiel later once they determine what the problem is. They can DEFINITELY keep the shoe after I mail them back. I surely don't want a product from a company that acts like this."
5,Great bass stand,"I bought this bass stand for my fiance. It is sturdy, holds his bass nicely, and looks great in our living room. I recommend it to anyone looking for a nice bass stand."
4,The Mighty Spinners...,"3 1/2 stars? O.K. - 4 stars. I am a huge Spinners fan and although I enjoyed this DVD, I felt I might have enjoyed it more. All the great songs are there, and the Bonus section has an extensive interview with the group. However, there was something slightly lackluster about the show - perhaps the subdued audience, or the aging performers themselves. Or the disparity that exists between our memories of the polished studio recordings of the songs and the (unavoidably) inferior live stage versions. Or maybe I'm just being too picky - I don't know. At any rate, Spinners fans (or fans of the genre) will still like this DVD, so by all means check it out. And for what it's worth, I saw the Spinners in a live show recently and was glad I did. It was pretty much the same act as on this DVD. They put 100% of themselves into their performance, and are truly a ""class"" act. But for the reasons stated, I'll refrain from giving it the ultimate 5 star rating."
3,Good DVD but ....,I like this DVD because it really showcases some classic r&b tunes done Philly style! The problem is that there is a new lead singer in the group. As we all know the original lead singer was Phillipe Wynn. Now the new guy is pretty good but he doesn't replace the original. Matter of fact the new guy does his best to emulate Phillipe but end the end he is not the man! However this dvd is worth the price and is definately a collectible for r&b fans!
2,looking for the early spinners this wasn't it,"well i thought this was going to be a classic dvd, instead i get the spinners in their latter years, the interveiws was ok but their voices has aged with time expected more got less, needed the younger spinners who by the way was and awesome group of the 70's. This was like harold melvin & the blue notes, without teddy pendergrass."
4,Storm then the Calm,"I used and loved to play the flute in my early days, so Iam a fan of Hubert Laws music since forever.This cd is an example, once again, of his brilliant and master performance of the flute.Thank's Hubert for your gift."
3,hubert laws storm then the calm,"Ovaerall, I was disappointed with this, although that could be the result of unrealistic expectations at the outset. I met the artist on Flute ByLaws, and Baila Cinderella set the bar high, so I was not ready for the synthesizer and vocals, which took too much away from the driving, forceful sound I knew. The artist's sound is still appealig, but not in this context. This is not a disc I would buy again."
4,Not as POWERFUL as it seems it should be,"I note that most reviewers so far have been long-time Rautavaara fans, and that most find this opera equal to their expectations. My own feelings approach those expressed very cogently by the reviewer from Berlin ""John"". For an explosive libretto and a massive assault force of voices and instruments, RASPUTIN never lifts me off my seat. Part of the problem just might be the recording, which sounds as if it were done with a single omni mike at the fire-exit door of the theater. Only Salminen ever seems PRESENT acoustically, and that not consistently. The orchestra/voice balance is vague and often inchoate. Combined with the very odd faded-color light-through-a-texture filming, the whole experience lacks intensity, which I'd say couldn't have been anyone's intention."
3,"Lainie is a great singer, just waiting for you to discover","Wowl! What a dynamic singer Lainie is. She is a very powerful, but yet sensitive singer. The lady can reall sing. The question is where has she been all these years? We all could have been enjoying her for the last thirty or forty years if only we had known about her.For this cd Lainie choose the great American Songbook for her repertoire. For the most part I think she did a good job with her tune selection.As for the band, she choose only the best musicians to back her up. I would like to mention that her music director was Shelly Markham. He did a great job with the arrangements.In conclusion, I want to thank Lainie for the great performances she offered us. I would like to encourage any fans of great singing to try this singer out and let her woo you. I don't feel you will be disappointed."
4,Excellent reference guide,I was able to purchase this book several years ago and have found it to be an invaluable tool to me as a Landman. I have been in the business for 7+ years and I still reference this manual periodically. If you can find a copy buy it.
5,simply the best,luther vandross was and is the only ultimate love doctor that i have known and his music says it all. he was a legend in this life and hopefully in his current life. RIP luther.
5,THE BEST!,I just love this CD. I brought this CD back in 2008 when I was living in FLORDIA. I use to run 3 miles in this park three days a week and Lurther ran with me everytime. Please don't ever lend out your CDs. I never got it back. So I got a new copy several months ago. And I been playing it day in and day out. I love it! Lurther bring so much joy to me when I'm down and out I always see a way out. His music has a way of making everything alright. I love Luther.
5,Awesome,Luther is an awesome artist...this CD is a great compilation of his greatest hits from his beginning to his end. I think there was only one song that I wasn't familiar with.
1,The Ultimate Luther Vandross,"There wwereas only two new songs on the CD, cost too much for so many old songs. I was dissapointed"
4,Keeps you reading on,"I like the genre, so i like it. however, it is not any complicated plot (although it does go back and forth with some whodunits and such). the love scenes are pretty good. recommended if you like optimistic, fun and sexy."
1,"the problem is this. if I buy 1/5 ounce (.5) for 5.00, i am not paying 5.21 per ounce as stated, I am paying 10.00 per ounce!","if I buy 1/5 ounce (.5) for 5.00, i am not paying 5.21 per ounce as stated, I am paying 10.00 per ounce! This is not truth in advertising. You cannot invent a price just to get your sale on top of the list. period."
3,"Didn't treat, The redness returns after a few hours","My eyes get dry and red from computer usage,just put this drops in my eyes, will eliminate redness ,but redness returns after a few hours.Cons:After using this drops my eyes feel dry and irritated."
4,Nice little pocket book,This is a nice little pocket book. For the price you can't beat it. Quite informative.
4,Perfect Reference for BB's,For those of you who like step by step guides in a What / Why / How / Example mode - then this is for you. Not a book to read but as a reference for any Lean work you do in your business. And in conjuction with a good mentor (look me up for this :-)) its a great source of the truth - and at a depth that you can use rather than alot of the 'waffly' rubbish that is out there for Services - Well done Don Tapping - another excellent production
5,Card Guides,"These cards are sturdy, colorful and exactly what the teacher ordered! I drove all over town looking for them and wish i had saved on the gas and just bought online the first time i saw them there!"
5,My wife loved this ring,This was a birthday present; unfortunately it arrived later than expected so missed her birthday but was still a great surprise when it arrived.The ring has a brilliant sparkle and looks real.
5,Great Value,"I have had these on my car for over 2 months now. They were a great buy compared to the local auto parts store. I was concerned about having squeaks or grinding noises, but they are quiet. I would never know they weren't OEM pads."
4,Not too bad,"I am by no means a professional photographer, but was looking for a cheap camera to take family photos with and this one has worked pretty well. It take great pictures outdoors. If you are taking pics indoors in low light you really have to mess with the settings to get a good pic, but its possible. It does seem to have a long battery life. I did have to search quite a bit to find it can take a memory card. I am using mine with a 1GB SD card. Without the card you can take only about 15-25 pics using good quality. The manual doesn't go in depth on using all the different settings on the camera so I would suggest taking some test shots trying all the different settings before taking pictures. Everything can be set to auto, but I found that, especially when taking pics indoors, you need to set the exposure to something other than auto, or the pics will not come out right."
3,Great for average shots - ZOOM no good,"I bought this camera because of the great price for a 5MP (Hardware resolution) I agree with all the prior reviews that:1. Menu not very user friendly, but can be learned with book2. Zoom is horrible - not able to get a good picture at 4x zoom.But in addition:3. Great for regular shots - very clear crisp pictures, but there is a little bit of a delay.4. I LOVE the size of this camera, very easy to carry (got cheap camera bag @ walmart)5. It runs on 2 ""AA"" batteries which seem to last a lot longer than other digital cameras I have used. I have only had to change the batteries once.Over all, this is a great beginner camera for easy shots. Easy to attach to computer and download pictures.The 3 stars is because of the zoom and menu - otherwise I would give it 4 or 5 stars for price, size and picture quality."
3,Good average camera,"The camera has excellent features for the price. I wouldn't trade it for the world. Some things that are lacking: analog zoom, rechargeable battery. Add those features and the camera is unbeatable.Also, the battery compartment is pretty flimsy. The plastic it is made of is easy to break. Keep scotch tape handy."
2,I have seen better cameras,"I thought this camera would be smaller, due to the description. The pictures on the screen look fuzzy. I am a bit disappointed with my purchase. I think it was ok for everyday use."
4,Too much expectation...,"I'm writing this as one of the old timers who actually played most of these in the arcades. This disc is good for those wishing to relive the old days of the arcade. The only things missing are the loud pings and crashes of the other machines and the local rock station over the radio.I don't believe people give this compilation a fair shake. They are SO use to Playstation, Xbox, Etc., that they forget when these games were released. Games like Pac-Man (an oldie but goodie) doesn't need a lot of memory. But people overlook a game like The Genji and the Heike Clans. When this came out, it was breaking new ground for side-scrolling fight games. It looks hokey...Because it's OLD. It's not gonna look like Metal Gear Solid.Yeah the games might be harder to control...on the Playstation. These games were made for an arcade Joystick. The controls don't translate well to the Playstation for whatever reason. Other than that, I've enjoyed the flawless recreations of these old games."
2,"Nice to find an old game, Too hard to control.","Back when I was about 6 or 7, I played the arcade version of Pac-Land. I bought this collection of 5 games, just to get the 1 game. I must say that I was disappointed. The controls for the game are terrible and it just makes it too hard to control. Where's the fun in a game if you can't control it?"
4,Sunshirt,"Went away for a week to the beach and they were worn at least 10 hours a day for 6 days, so far so good, no stretching and pulling, and colours have stayed nice and bright. Will buy again."
5,A GREAT BOOK ABOUT EDUCATION,"This is an entertaining and informative BOok to which high school, college students, and adults can relate. As good as the book is, the title could be more exciting, such as TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL or even THE COOL GENT. Because it is such a good book, it can pass with THE LESSON PLAN and should be a best seller very soon."
5,Beautiful and Very Christmas Inspired!,"I love this yarn, it makes beautiful scarves. Would order this again. Happy with my purchase. Thank you so much!"
5,A Must-Have for all lovers of funky jazz and/or Jimi Hendrix,"Take three outstanding musicians, give them some great Jimi Hendrix tunes as a starting point, and then simmer and cook until done!This record is terrific, and unlike anything you've ever heard before. The funky organ sounds of Dr. Lonnie Smith (remember, he is *not* the same guy as Lonnie Liston Smith), the jazz-rock jamming guitar sounds of John Abercrombie (who sounds here like he is channeling a mix of Hendrix, Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin)and the funky, always-on-it drums of Smitty Smith. Each song is about 10-12 minutes in length, so if you're looking for breezy, short rock tunes, don't buy this record. But for everyone else, give a listen!"
4,Great album -- smooth jazz improv. with a hint of Hendrix,"This album is basically the result of three great jazz musicians playing interpretations of famous Hendrix songs. Although none of the songs sound exacly like the Hendrix versions (they weren't meant to), the basic grooves are still there. All of the misicians are incredible, and the sounds they create are beautiful -- from the smooth sound of the guitar, to the brash sound of the Hammond B-3 through a distorted leslie speaker (and not to mention a strong percussion backing). I do not generally listen to jazz music, but I love this album, and I think other Hendrix/Lonnie Smith Trio fans will to. (The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the length of the songs -- all four songs are about ten minutes long, but other people may not mind long songs)."
4,a good entry level camcorder,"My first cam, for home video only.pic and sound are good, with adapter you can play tape on any VCRs. pretty light in my view, i can easily operate with one hand, battery life is 1.5 hour, compatible batteries can provide better number.only has black & white viewfinder, no LCD, but for this low price, i can live with it.overall, good cam for first time or entry level user who just want to record some family moments and share it, for that purpose this is a good choice."
4,"A good effort, but not comprehensive enough.","Well written. Emphasizes piece play over complex variations,and contains many forcing variations to keep you in familiar teritory(and your opponents out of comfortable book lines).The one weakeness is that ,despite the book's cliams, the variations for white are not a complete system and must be suplemented by other sources. As a weekend chess club warrior, I found the book to provide an excellent opening repetoire for black, and I enjoyed the large number of well annotated games which provide good insight into the typical middle and endgame possitions that arise from these openings. For a class D,C,or B player this book would be a good addition to your chess library."
5,Painfully good....,"The first time I plopped this CD in, I was thinking ""if it's half as good as `Trouble' then I'd be happy."" My happiness turned into complete elation. This CD is just as good as `Trouble' and it continues to grow on me with every listen. It is a little mellower than his first effort, perhaps a little darker. Having said that, it doesn't take anything away from this beautifully crafted CD.Highly, highly recommended."
3,better with each listen,"its a good cd, it grows with every listen. at first I found it a little mute, almost like every song was the same song all over again. it is getting better with each listen though. I still feel that it missing a little edge, could have added one song with some punch to it."
5,A great discovery,"Late to the party, I actually first experienced Ray Lamontagne thru this CD. I was immediately thunderstruck. The sound, ie musicians, engineering, etc. is superb. Ray's voice, compared by others with Van Morrison's, actually sometimes reminds me a bit of Joe Cocker (???). This is one of the best new artists I've heard in a decade. As good as Trouble is, I actually prefer Till the Sun Turns Black. I can't imagine anybody NOT liking this CD....a lot!Highly recommended."
4,Close but not Quite,"An excellent follow up to ""Trouble"" though some songs sounded vaguely reminiscent. In total, an excellent follow up, if not as groundbreaking as his first."
4,Gets better,"Ray Lamontagne's new album contains more instrumentation than his first. Although I wasn't sure at first whether I liked it as much as Trouble which I loved from the very first time I heard it, this one gets better the more you listen to it. Track 11 is one of his best ever and one of the nicest songs I've ever heard."
3,This album has it's moments.,"The problem is, the moments are few and far between. The best song on this album, by far, is Gone Away From Me and you don't get to it until track 7. Absolutely worth it once you get there though. ""Be Here Now"" drags on a little too long without changing. ""Empty"" gave me some hope as it had such a promising sound, but it too didn't hold my interest throughout. I admit, Gone Away From Me doesn't do that much changing throughout it's air time, but the lyrics kept me hooked in... the other songs, not so much. The last song, ""Within You"" is another good song but it fails to rescue the album as a whole.I think it's important to read reviews that disagree with your own opinions, so think about it."
5,Every Song He Sings Envelops You.......,"Ray LaMontagne's music is beyond anything I have experienced before. Each song slowly enters you and each time you hear it, you feel it more. All of Mr. LaMontagne's songs have become part of me. I feel each song and love them all. Everytime I listen to his music, I am still moved and shocked that someone is so talented. I feel sorry for the people who will never hear his songs, but I thank God everyday that I found Ray LaMontagne's music. Thank you Mr. LaMontagne for sharing part of yourself with the world."
5,7 out of 10 good/great songs = 5 star review,"Ray is the MAN!!!!!!! No current singer/songwriter gives me the feeling I get when I listen to this man. His music truly changed my life and opened up a whole new world of emotion. That being said, the change came about from his previous release Trouble. So, needless to say, I was ecstatic to hear he had plans to release a follow-up. Ray shot the moon with this one. While Trouble had many many great songs (Shelter, Jolene, Forever My Friend, Trouble), this new album has just as many (if not more) great/good songs (favorites are Be Here Now, Empty, Lesson Learned, Till the Sun Turns Black & Within You). I cannot wait to see these performed live as Ray's live show is one of the best experiences of my life. If you haven't seen him, you just gotta!!!!!!! If you are new to Ray, this CD would be a fine introduction. If you are already a fan, you undoubtedly already have this CD. Great CD, best of 2006 (so far), go get it today!!!!!!!!"
3,Fantastic,"Besides this CD, I purchased 3 others (different artists). All I can say is that after putting this on, I don't listen to the others.I just can't stop listening to this disk. Blues, a touch of Dixieland, Beatles , etc. influences are expertly woven into this original and unexpected music."
2,Holy Freakin downer!,"Bought this for the great deal but wish I could return it. I couldn't make it to song 6 without turning it off cause it was boring me to death. There a several good songs but overall this sucks. I loved ""Trouble"" it was mellow without being boring, so I had high hopes for this too. If my wife ever divorces me this will be a good album but otherwise it's a buzz kill."
2,Folky,"If you like old school folk music, you'll enjoy this disk. The bluesy track ""Three More Days"" is great ~ but doesn't blend in with the rest of the albumn."
1,Horrible,One song on the whole CD is good. I didn't like this at all and feel I wasted my money. I was so disappointed I considered sending it to the record label. Ray Lamontagne has more talent than he's showing.
3,A Little Disappointing,"Of the many, many songs available for his sophomore release, LaMontagne didn't choose his strongest - or set them for the maximum ""bang"" - in my opinion. I'm sure there was a method and a reason why he chose what he did, and that's his prerogative. Maybe I'm jaded having seen most of them live - simple and powerful, standing on their own without all the padding - but at any rate, I'm a little disappointed.The arrangement of Can I Stay reminds me of something I'd hear in the background of a ""Lifetime Women's Network"" movie - sappy. It would have been so much better, so much more personal were it just Ray and his guitar, as he does it live.And the horns on Three More Days just sound cheezy.I am pleased with the title track & Lesson Learned. You Can Bring Me Flowers is funky but again, the horns are cheezy.New tunes Barfly, Be Here Now and Truly, Madly, Deeply are ""perfectly Ray"", though."
5,"Intense, beautiful music...","I really liked his music on first listening, then I realized all that he was saying. Moody and a little sad, but that is what I love. The words are so meaningful and insightful. I love this man's way of expression. All his music is really good. A lot of variety in styles, but still all his own. A little reminiscent of Gregory Page's style but more serious. Buy all of his c.d.s. you will love them."
5,Beautiful.,This was a gift from my husband and is my absolute favourite album from Ray LaMontagne. This man has such a soothing and beautiful voice and is a joy to watch live.
5,Excellent,"I've almost worn this CD out listening to it! Love it, especially track 2 - Empty. This guy is awesome....a true artist. Looking forward to purchasing his other CDs."
5,Amazing Album,"This is so good it hurts. I have listened to it over and over with rapt attention. The texture is rich, the poetry, thoughtful. The final five tracks create a beautiful sequence, particularly the couplets eight and nine and ten and eleven. Tracks ten and eleven form one song in two movements and create such a haunting experience that I was frightened on my first listening. I cannot recommend this high enough, and this is after a couple months of consistantly listening to this album. It is my favorite LaMontagne album thus far."
4,It's not like Nick Drake...,"its more like Dan Fogelberg. While I was really blown away by the CD's first two tracks, I found the rest of the album a bit of a let-down: Pleasant, a nice showcase for Mr. LaMontayne voice, but lyrically undistinguished. Even so, I've enjoyed the CD quite a bit -- ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TWO TRACKS -- and would recommend it to fans of Nick Drake, Jack Johnson and -- face it -- Dan Fogelberg. I know it's hipper to be likened to Drake than Fogelberg (by a long stretch) but let's not get carried away, people!"
5,Fantastic,Ray's voice really comes through on this album and there are no bad songs. I have been wanting this album for a while.
1,Save your money,"This is honestly the biggest waste of money on the internet. Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't even bother plugging this thing in. the packaging is so misleading. Most docking stations will charge your remotes when you place them in the holder. This ""docking station"" does nothing more than hold your remotes. Also it can only charge 1 battery at a time so if you've got multiple remotes, you're out of luck.Just save your money and buy something better."
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this charger at a B&M; store since the 29.99 one was sold out and I was in need of a battery charging unit .... This was a waste of money. I have had the unit for about 30 hours now and I get approximately 1-2 hours of play out of it before I have to charge the battery again. It takes around 15-30 minutes for the charging indicator to go from red (low charge) to blue (fully charged) which is nice, but the ""fully charge"" batteries last for less that 2 chapters in Paper Mario before needing another charge. I am going to take this back and try the Nyko charger to see if it is just a common issue with the batteries.Overall, VERY disappointed with the Intec product."
3,mixed quality,"This unit does not charge the batteries in the controllers ""displayed"" in this unit, you must remove the batteries and connect them to the front slot. This means you can only charge one battery at a time. The ""display"" slots are not very well designed. Only plus--it is powered off the USB port of your Wii (or any powered USB port.)"
4,An Awsome Aquatic Adventure,"An ocean lover's dream come true. Become a thrill seeking scientist/diver and go on the adventure of a lifetime. Choose one of several marine vehicles to pilot and cunduct a variety of assignments from simple research tasks to search and rescue missions, and explore lots of exotic locations from a tropical oasis just off the American coast to the Bermuda Triangle and even the lost city of Atlantis! Your deep sea trek will also gain you an arch enemy named Simon Black, an industrialist who is damaging the aquatic landscape with his underwater factories and plants. Your persute of Black and destruction of his precious industries will eventually pit you in a final battle with him. This game is fun and imaginative, I recommend it for anyone who is into marine research, gaming or, better yet, both."
2,aphro tracks r the only good ones,"very disappointing...i thought a DnB cd would have some more kick to it.....especially when it has aphrodite mixing....but the bass was just lacking, the tracks were great but the force of the bass just wasn't there."
1,What the heck???,"First off I was searching on Amazon out of boredom and was knocked off my seat when I saw that Aphrodite is still making cd's. I was into the whole rave scene back when it was still cool in the mid to late 90's. What in the hell is going on here? Does anyone really still listen to this crap anymore? If you can honestly tell me that you can sit down and enjoy this cd while not being high on X or 'cid then I can honestly tell you that you're a filthy liar. By the way, your future children just called and they want you to grow up and stop wearing 44 inch wide pants and get a real job. Oh yeah, and put down that glow stick while you're at it too."
1,Not worth the money.,"Took weeks to get & didn't print colors correctly, even after downloading the latest drivers from HP. Must not have been reconditioned after all."
1,A stategy guide that leaves things out,"The guide leaves an entire class of item out, not even mentioning thier existance, it also gets details of the actual levels wrong (even taking into acount the random generation nature of the levels) giving flat-out wrong information."
5,Comma Sense: A Fun-damental Guide to Pronunciation.,"For me, personally, this was the right book at the right time.I was searching for a source that would support or contrast the recent (British) publication entitled: EATS, SHOOTS AND LEAVES which, while an excellent and useful guide, left me confounded regarding its appropriateness for American English. This matter was settled promptly by the authors of the subject.My recent re-interest in writing improvement and excellence, aside from standard business letters, has been spurned by an increased usage of email.I am familiar with Richard Lederer's work and use of humor, and this lived up to and exceeded my expectations: All issues pertaining to punctuation are addressed; and all conceivable questions answered.Additionally, the handy ""review"" section following the last chapter makes this an invaluable, easy-to-use, portable guide.This is far more than recommendable: it's necessary!"
3,Like most Alessi designs - simple and functional,"A light, compact tome that provides a decent cursory overview of the aesthetic arc of this legendary Italian design house. Book itself is nicely laid out, illustrated and printed on excellent stock. A great start point for newcomers to the field in learning more about key designers and products launched and fielded by Alessi. On the downside though, this book lacks depth and could've used better 'copy' to provide for a more interesting read."
5,Sci-fi fan gets hooked on mystery,"Wow... I am a die-hard sci-fi fan and have no use for mystery or drama. But totally ran out of books to read and was desparate. My mom sent me this about a year ago so I thought ""it'll hold me over till I can get to the bookstore"" RIGHT... it held me over for about a night because I just couldn't put it down!!! This story flows so smoothly... the author's voice is just perfect. And it wasn't just the whodunnit aspect either. That was awesome, but I never figure that stuff out. I did get some of it though (aren't you proud of me?) The best part of this book was the human relation. The way the characters interacted with eachother. Add the mystery and Wallah! I kept running to the living room to tell my husband about it. He took me to the bookstore the next day to buy every Joy Fielding book I could get my hands on. If you like fast-paced, smooth moving stories, this one is for you!"
1,Don't Cry Now,"A very tedious book. I did finish it however. Amanda's mom was unbelievably stupid. It was very unbelievable that an educated woman would go from one situation to another feeling as sick as she must have from being poisoned, ignoring her symptoms and all she could say over and over and over and over was that she never gets sick. Well she made me sick having to listen to her."
4,Keeps you guessing,"This book goes along nicely with lots of guessing who are the bad guys and who are the good guys. Just when you think you have figured it out, nope you don't. After you have suspected everyone possible, you find out you have been fooled by a master of misdirection--This was a really good read but was given only 4 stars because the heroine was a little dense - other than that, good escapism."
5,Great one,"All of Joy's books are great, but this was one of her best. (See Jane Run is my personal favorite.This has alot of mystery and some romance, just what her fans love!"
5,Great MacBook Pro backpack,"Although this backpack is pricey, it is extremely well designed and has lots of room for accessories, as well as, other items such as binders and books. One of the best features is the removable inner sleeve that perfectly fits the MacBook Pro 15.4. The sleeve is well padded and also has hardboard built in that gives further protection for the laptop. The sleeve's handle is on top so it works great when you want to carry around the laptop but not the entire backpack. I have a stack of laptop carry cases in my office. The Brenthaven backpack is definitely the best of the bunch."
3,Excellent Blast-Death,"this is Death metal of the high-speed, high-quality sort. There are some reasons I won't give this more than three stars. First of all, the production is not as clear as everyone says.The guitar solos are somewhat buried in the mix, and the drums are not as far up in the mix as on the first album. Secondly, even though this is a raging, brutal album, it doesn't even come close to the intesity of Krisiun's debut masterpiece Black Force Domain. Get that first, then this one. This is great stuff, no doubt, but Krisiuns done better before."
5,Unexpected pleasure,"I happened onto a copy of this book, assuming the subject might be a bit too specific for my level of interest in trees. What a blast the book turns out to be! It adds a whole new element (and in fact, depth) to appreciating the specialness that is all around in San Francisco.Engaging read; beautifully done book."
5,"If you love San Francisco, you'll love this book","This book is an absolute delight for lovers of San Francisco, whether you are particularly fascinated by trees or no. The book is packed with interesting information about San Francisco's trees, and about the city itself. The suggested walking tours rank among the best walks I've taken in this city, and that's saying something. On my first walk with this book, for example, I learned that the word carat is derived from the ancient word quirat, which refers to the carob tree. The seeds of this tree are remarkably uniform in weight and were used by the ancients as a measure of weight. The walk in my own neighborhood, where I've lived for several years, pointed out several remarkable sights that I'd never noticed before. If you live in San Francisco or plan to visit soon, then buy this book. It will enhance your experience of San Francsico immeasurably."
4,Over all worth it.,"This is a nice product. I bought one for under 300 and figured it was worth it. Its not amazing, but at night you can see around very well. Don't expect commando type quality (this is a generation one), but if you want to have some fun it will do the job. Its light but sturdy, very well built. Just for general information about the IR light, you can notice it, but only when its on and pointed right at your eyes. And then it looks just like a red dot. Not sure if you can still notice it at a distance or not but i know my cat saw it, so other wildlife might as well at closer distances. If you want it on and to see an animal too, i suggest pointing it slightly away so that you can still see the creature, so the light isn't as noticeably to them."
3,not like one in add,the one we received was not addjustable. like the one in the add.we kept it because can be used on outher application. had to get one somewere else for car we was working on at that time.
3,Pac-Maniacs only,"The last of the five in Namco's series - it includes: Pac-Mania, Dragon Spirit, Metro-Cross, Baraduke, and Legend of Valkyrie. Except for Pac-Mania, a wonderful early version of a 3-D world for Pac-Man to adventure in, the remaining titles on this disc are unappetizing at best, and generally boring at worst. The strange overhead perspective of Dragon Spirit will throw off some players. Legend of Valkyrie was an early attempt at a RPG and is laughable by today's standards. Some of the rest I had never heard of until trying this disc. I have a copy just for the Pac-Mania game, but the rest I rarely play, and it mostly sits unused in the box. Not a fitting conclusion for this series."
5,my chihuahua loves it!,"My dog,Petmate Ball A Bout Interactive Cat Toyabout 12 lbs, loves this ball. He chases it and chases it, and sleeps with it. We have had it quite a while but then it started breaking. We could not find another and did not remember where we got it. Thank goodness for duct tape but now we have a source! Thanks Amazon."
2,I expected more from this book.,"Long ago and far away, as a young girl, I devoured romantic suspense novels by Victoria Holt, Mary Stewart and Phyllis Whitney. But maybe you can never go home again. I came across this 1990 book by Whitney this year (2009) in the library and decided to kinda go down memory lane. But this book was a big disappointment and I'm not sure if it's because it is a more recently written one by the author and the quality is not the same as her earlier work or if I just require more in a book than I did back in the day. The characters in this are cardboard, the plot is silly and contrived, with New Age crystals and looks back into past lives, the romance is annoying and the suspense not suspenseful. Guess I need to go check out one of Whitney's earlier works to see if it's just this particular book I find objectionable."
3,Not of Whitney's usual quality,"For some reason this book was not as enjoyable as Whitney's others. I found several aspects of the ending too easy to predict. And no child talks the way Jilly does. If you haven't read Whitney, start with The Turquoise Mask, Dream of Orchids, or Rainbows in the Mist first. If you prefer historical rather than contemporary novels, try Sea Jade or The Trembling Hills. Fun!"
2,Disappointing,"This book is mostly a series of gee wiz ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" type vignettes. There are threads of good information that might have made an interesting short article with some major editing."
4,"The heart's still there, even if the voice isn't","This collection from John Sebastian and the J-Band is sort of an all-star jug band, with the addition of the late Yank Rachell, Rory Block, Paul Rishell and Annie Raines in addition to J-Band regulars Fritz Richmond, Jimmy Viviano and James Wormsworth. Sebastian's heart and soul have always been with this music, even as he rose and fell on the pop/rock charts. In a way, it's a shame that this real jug band material comes when John's pipes are shot. He just cannot sing any more. But he's still got the feeling for the music and he's still got the harmonica and guitar. Please give us more like this."
5,"Super, fast delivery",I was totally suprised when the CD showed up in my mail just a couple of days after I ordered it.You must have ran all the way to the post office.
2,Not For Kids Who Still Believe In Santa,"Beethoven is the supporting cast in a movie about a widow, her teenage son and an advertising campaign for the ASPCA. The movie has little of the charm of the earlier Beethoven movies. Preteens will get a few chuckles from this, but this is not a movie for kids who still believe in Santa.I rated it only two stars for the thin plot, poor acting, and blatant advertising. I've been adopted by shelter dogs, heartily support pet adoption, but this movie was just awful. Definitely overpriced as well."
3,My second favorite in the series,"Beethoven's Christmas Adventure is the 6th in a long lasting series. Can you believe the very first movie,Beethoven, came out almost 20 years ago in 1992?!?!? (Wow - do I feel old!) Over the years, there has been:Beethoven's 2ndBeethoven's 3rdBeethoven's 4thBeethoven's 5thBeethoven's Big BreakI'm always a sucker for the first movie in the series, but I've got a surprise for you...in Beethoven's Christmas Adventure, Beethoven finally speaks! Your kids will love it :) How can you resist this sweet, large slobbering St. Bernard and his quest to save Christmas?My son and I watched the movie together this morning and he was just glued to the TV. He really got a kick out of the lost elf and of course, Beethoven. (and I got a few good chuckles in there too!) Beethoven's Christmas Adventure, I'm sure, will turn into a Christmas favorite in the years to come, for him :)"
3,NIV Young Discoverer's Bible - Used,"It was in okay condition, but not as good of condition as described in the sale."
1,Accessible?,"The jacket blurb says this series comprises the most ""accessible recognition guides."" I'm not sure what that means, nor am I sure who this book is intended for but it wasn't me, nor, I suspect, any average backyard nature observer.The illustrations are beautiful but as an identification guide it is totally useless. First, it is too inclusive. Butterflies and moths from the entire world are included, making its applicability limited. Worse, the insects are arranged not by color, size, habitat, or similar factor, but by their zoological family! If I were knowledgeable enough to have this information at my disposal, I probably wouldn't need a guide book. Finally, very few of the insects have an illustration of the caterpillar stage included.My recommendation: if you want to identify moths or buttereflies, look for another guide."
3,"Great book, but bad printing job","I have to admit I bought this book to pick out the next butterfly tattoo I'm getting. So that being said, color and photo definition was important. Unfortunately, the printing on this book was poorly done. The colors are all a little washed out and not very sharp. Otherwise this was a great book. It gave me more information about butterflies and moths than I ever wanted to know. So if your purpose is just to learn about them this is a great item. If you need the photos for some reason, be prepared to double check the color accuracy some other way."
3,ok...but could be better,"The book was nice where they show you the top & underside of the butterflies and moths, but i did NOT need the world listing, just North America...ditch the places i'm not living in and give me more info per listing."
2,Disappointed,"The ""crochet"" beads were larger than they appeared in the picture - or course without a pic of it on a person, there is no sense of scale - and not as fine or dainty as my daughter thought it would be. Being called a ""collar"" necklace, implies that it is fairly short, which would account for her thinking the beads would be smaller than they are. The necklace is actually fairly long - not a ""collar"" necklace at all."
2,Looks cheap,"I won't be wearing this to work because the crocheted beads look cheap. The color in the picture is deceiving too, because the green is actually brighter."
2,This is art?,"I bought the book because I lived in Splendora both before 1977 and after 1997. I was an artist too, although my works werent quite as bizarre (or ""creative"", if you prefer) and I dont agree with many of his discriptions of the town. Splendora was never an ""artsy hubbub""....it was just a tiny spot in the road back then....barely even a town!! The book was self-indulgent and, even though I lived there, I didnt recognize any of the landmarks he spoke of. Maybe it's a good read---I dont know---but it was all too distracting to me."
3,"Decent overall, but Harry's versions are still the best!","This album is O.K. as far as tribute albums go, but nothing beats Harry Nilsson's original voice. That being said, many of these remakes are superb; the version of ""Don't Forget Me"" with the added percussion is excellent! However, there are some severe mutilations as well: the version of ""Coconut"" by the B52's guy and the complete ruination (a real word?) of ""Jump into the Fire"", a song that really should NOT be re-done by anyone! Be forewarned: some of Harry's biggest hits (eg. Without You) are not covered, because he did not write them..."
4,Harry Hurrah!,"As others have noted, tribute albums can be hit and miss affairs. Thankfully, this one is mostly hits; lots of great tunes done with reverence and a few twists. Personally, I absolutely love the way that Fred Schneider belts out ""Coconut."" I think Harry would have approved. Randy Newman does a gorgeous take on ""Remember,"" Aimee Mann's version of ""One"" is outstanding, and the Roches and Mark Johnson send ""Spaceman"" into a thrilling orbit. On the downside; I never liked ""Joy"" and even Joe Ely can't save that one. And anything that Victoria Williams sings only causes me to skip to the next track. Not sure if this CD will appeal to all diehard Nilsson fans, but for anyone curious about this legendary singer-songwriter, this is a very good quality tribute album that may motivate you to check out the originals."
3,Love Harry Nilsson,"Not crazy about others performing his catalogue, but offers more musical compositions showcasing genius of Harry Nillson. Thought that HN was a remarkable musician."
2,DONT BUY!!,I bought one of these controllers and it broke in 1 month!! Say your playing a nascar game your going along and all of a sudden bam!!! you hit the wall and the controller doesnt make the car turn!! Yeah sure the red glow is cool but dont let that fool you into buying this!! Buy the regular Nintendo brand ones.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased the cam in Feb 2002 after extensive comparsions to Sony and Canon models. The cam worked perfectly for 2 months, but I now CANNOT put the camera in playback mode..so I cannot playback video or look at pics taken. The camera is a dud, and I would not recommend it at all although it is attractively priced relative to the equivalent Sony and Cannon. I am in the market again, and will probably go with Sony for its reputation!I e-mailed JVC advising them of my problem with their product and never heard back from them. Buy at your own risk!!"
1,"Quite un-Seuss illustrations, VERY un-Seuss rhymes.","The rhymes start out strong; proper Seussian lickety-split, with humor in each line. But by the time ""Finagle the Agent"" shows up it's just cliche and banal stuff that I can't believe Seuss ever wrote himself. You get the sense that somebody else finished it. He certainly never illustrated it, and the inclusion of the Cat-in-the-Hat as narrator seems weird; he has no purpose in the story. This is the very first in a long string of sell-outs that Suess' widow has committed over the years."
2,too hard for young children,"What everyone is saying that this isn't Seuss's real work, I believe. Seuss uses language that is easy to understand for children, and they used rather big words in this. I do like this book but if I read it to a kid they would only understand some of it."
1,Should have stayed in the drawer,"In the rush to cash in on the Dr. Seuss name, his widow has released a book that he probably never intended to be published. The rhymes are mediocre, real clunkers at times, and the illustrations show none of the character of those Dr. Seuss actually created for his other books. Whatever the redeeming social value of this book (and that's a stretch) it's almost painful to read."
5,Better than I thought!,These are a thick plastic!They are great!Worth the money.I got another set as soon as I opened the first set.
2,"Some fun, but also a disappointment","I bought this because of Syndicate, but it turns out the Syndicate in this collection is nothing like the old PC version that I loved... (It's a weird console port from the Genesis...) Same goes for Wing Commander... I had fun playing Desert Strike and the flipper-game, but I wouldn't have bought it just for that."
1,Inexcusable butchering of road rash games,"As other reviews note, the music on the Road Rash games is one song looped. ONE. SONG. LOOPED. The best part of those games was the music. Why in the world they would not put the original music in those games is beyond me, and I am dumbfounded. EA, you've let me down (again)."
4,Don't believe the haters!,"Each of the games I played on this disc are everything that I remember from when I first played most of them on the Sega Genesis (or SNES). If you're a mature gamer, then you'll appreciate what these fun games were in their day and how far we've come since. If you're just a kid, then you really won't care or even get it. The music is everything I remember, regardless of what others say, and the game play is spot-on like the originals. Its cheap, its fun, and worth the $10 price tag to have in your PSP collection."
2,"No Realm of Impossibility, Axis Assasin, Dr.J vs. Bird..UPDATE THESE instead","Okay, EA Replay - great idea ! But WHY some of these CRAP titles?They could have at least done Realm of Impossibility, Axis Assasin, Bird vs Dr.J !! Even without updating them, THESE are the great EA games of old. ARCHON, even. And futhermore, PSP would have been a great place to update these games as well.Road rash = great pick. (unbelievable original music left out). Only good thing on this title.EA has the right idea....but HORRIBLE choice of games and HORRIBLE editing of original music. OMG, who is in charge of this company ? Pitiful."
3,Trobled waters,Interesting thriller film played very well by all including jennifer being an agent. Great ending to the film love the journey in finding the young girl
1,Unbelievable...,"20 minutes into the viewing of this weak production I came to my trusted Amazon to check the reviews and remain astounded at the overall 4* rating... I returned to viewing only because of my attraction to Jennifer Beals, but even she can not prompt a 2nd star from me for this, the worst production I have witnessed since Ronald Reagan gave up acting..."
5,Probably a very real look at ins/outs of the industry of fashion,"Having been a Jay fan from day One, I spent weeks hunting down this DVD locally so I could see Jay in action. Turns out, Jay isn't the only fascinating thing about fashion - it's a hot mess! We on the outside have the illusion that the designer draws something, and 2 days later a skinny kid wears it on the catwalk - not so. The sheer number of hands, people, and egos that come into play are astounding, and it's now amazing to me that anything gets done at all.I still love Jay, even if he is stubborn and immature."
5,Loved the movie,Excellent Movie... would watch over and over again. Didn't know the challenges that one faces upon a major Fashion Week show.
3,HP DeskJet 610C INKJET PRINTER,"This printer works well, but the replacement ink cartridges are expensive. Two ink cartridges will cost more than the cost of the printer. With Epson or Cannon, generic cartridges can be purchased for much less."
2,Error on Network + Cheat sheet 0-7897-2177-5 Patrick Grote,"(1.) Pg.71 second last paragraph word rest should change to reset (i.e.: backup and do not reset the archive bit ). (2.) Pg.45 second paragraph . terminator should be 50 ohms not 5 ohms. (3.) Pg.52 At the middle page, you should state the advantage of STP , not UTP. (4.) Pg.77 , At the middle page, Item 1.

Pg. 94, confuse on your explanation of source route bridge on item 1 to item 5, please advice"
4,Buy this even just for the photos!,"This is one of those handy little books that is just a joy. For starters, the full-colored photos (almost one each per recipe) speak volumes: the photos are superb and so multi-textured that you could seemingly eat the devil's food cake (pg 25) and the chocolate brulee (pg 63) right off the page!The book begins with a brief (just 3 pages) introduction to the types of chocolate, how to melt it, and how to store it. From then on, the recipes begin with six chapters - each devoted to the kind of dessert. Thus: chocolate baking, chocolate cakes, chocolate biscuits, teacakes and squares, tarts and pies, and chocolate puddings."
3,A Thin Slice Of Lenny Bruce,This fairly thin book is a first hand account of the time the author spent with Lenny Bruce. Probably the best part of the fairly pricy book are the photographs which were taken by the author.
5,Sheer Obsession,"Purchasing this for a trip by plane.As a person ages, one has to change fragrances, because of the different chemistries of our bodies.This is my favorite, being light, yet so fresh and nice smelling. Often have people ask ""what fragrance are you wearing?""This product is practically impossible to buy in my area."
3,perfume review over priced,I love this perfume but perfume station charged more than the double the original price of the perfume AND... the perfume smelled different almost like alcohol. I wont buy this again from this store.
3,Not sturdy as I expected but OK,"I gave 3 stars because it is pretty good but not that strong. When this binder was delivered, it had already been damaged."
5,Excellent parenting book,"I am a child/family psychologist and don't like most parenting books for my clients because they present theories as facts without the research behind it. This is one of 3 books that I recommend because it is well-researched yet easy to read and comprehend. Gottman's work in the field of psychology is highly respected, and the research from which this book emanates is thorough and rigorous. Yet his format in the book is such that you can immediately begin to apply his ""emotion-coaching"" technique. If you are having difficulty coping with your child's emotional outbursts, read this book!"
5,Great book for parents of any age child.,"This book came recommended from my therapist, we were having issues with our 4 year old daughter. I realized when she became angry or frustrated, I checked out! After reading this book and changing my reaction to her, she has completely changed, because I changed."
3,Helpful tips,I found this book useful with some practical ideas. Discipline tips are particularly useful and realistic.
4,Very Helpful,Excellent resource for parents - quick read.Would like to have had more specific conversation examples for very young children (my youngest is 3) however am already noticing a positive change in my children's behavior as a result of using book's tactics.
5,Great book.,"Gottman's ""Raising an Emotionally Intelligent child"" book is a much needed book in today's society with so much IT/social media and yet so little emotional connection. I love this book and the many wonderful ideas in it. This is a must read for all parents today!"
5,Children's Emotional Intelligence revealed!,Gottman is a renound researcher and author and has once again provided fascinating and up to date research on the life of a child and the importance of parent style and interactions with their children. Teaching children to name their emotions and learn from them provides a foundation for healthy relationships and the ability to regulate emotion. A must read!!
3,To be honest...,"To be honest, there was not anything in this book that I would not find in any other book on effective writing, let alone criminal justice. In fact, I could even recommend some better ones! I sifted through it; got a headache after trying to give it a chance; failed to return it; and it is currently sitting in my dresser drawer under a bunch of junk. Three is generous... only because it probably is good to the reader who knows NOTHING about writing (okay, do not gauge my writing by this review folks lol). Effective? ... I would call this 'Six Steps to Getting to the Point'... ouch..."
4,BUY THIS GAME,"This game is awesome. There's a large variety of weapons available to you and the controls are great. Plus, for less than a buck this game is worth it."
3,Cheap and basic truck bed cover,"The cover is made of quality materials and installs easily with a few simple tools. It rolls up and stows quickly, which is what I need as I am always using the bed for hauling equipment and such. Now for why only 3 stars. First, the cover does NOT fit snug on top of the tailgate and the rain comes on in. I wanted a cover to keep the water out and this cover only keeps out a light shower. So I called Lund's customer service and spoke to a couple people, the guy who could fix the leaky seal over the tailgate never called me by back. So I deducted a star for the leak and another star for the poor customer support. A cheap basic cover."
1,rubbish,"i dont even think i would give this -19 It is comercial rubbish, and the only use I can think of is to wipe your bum on the slleve!!!"
1,step one ? step down more like,"Never in my whole 15 years on this earth have i heard such rubbish. Their corny dance routines and cheesy lyrics make me feel sick. Every song sounds the same! They fail to live up to abba (much as they would like to) and are a complete waste of producers time and money. Personally i feel sorry for the girls. Even i will admit their voices are half decent, but unfortunally they are dragged down by the wannabee actor and the annoying H (what is the boys real name, then again does anyone care). Only buy this cd if you are mentally challenged."
1,it didnt work/wrong pieces,"first of all the battery and the charger were the wrong ones, so i didnt get to record my grandson's graudation. i was so disappointed about the video camara. so right now it is in a box put away. No battery that fits. No charger either. So I rate this video camara a big ZERO"
2,Not that great.,"Let the publisher be your guide.It's by Penguin Press -- it's for someone who's browses a half-price book store and gets the idea that some familiarity with pre-socratic philsophy is something they want to add to their lives.It lacks the critical richness of other works (I enjoy Patricia Curd et. al's ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHY) -- so if you want depth, you won't find it here.I read this book as part of an ancient greek philosophy class and I hated virtually everything on the reading list. This book was part of said curs-ed list."
