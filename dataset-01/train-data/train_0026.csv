3,Good.....but could've definitely been better,"I used to love this movie........until I read the book. I know that that's always the case, and some people might call me picky, but Rankin/Bass didn't make a classic. Now don't get me wrong, the movie is still really good; the animation and voice casting are definitely 5 and a half stars. But it cut out SO much, including Beorn (which is one of my favorite parts). My dad hates this movie, but I don't. I've been meaning to see ""The Lord of the Rings"", which I've heard is better. Here's a tip: you want REAL fantasy entertainment, read the book."
2,Close But No Cigar,This movie is actualy ok compared to the animated Lord Of The Rings but it would have helped if they would have followed the story a little more
2,Quite annoying.,"I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings, and this cartoon is a real let down. Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"" is phenomenal, if you are seeking a worthy portrayal of the books."
3,My god! They killed Bilbo!,"I loved The Hobbit as a book, so I thought; Mabye the movie is, if not equally, then at least great. But I was dead wrong. Everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong... From the opening with the visit of the dwarves, 'till gollum, 'till the feud between Bilbo and Thorin... They didn't even get the Goblins right... and I should think drawing a goblin/orc would be a task easy enough for people that haven't even read the book... And the way they just CUT OUT large parts of the book (like the visit at Beorn's place) is just not right. But I gave this movie 3 stars, because like I said earlier; I love the story, and I'll make sure my future kid's love it too. (But NO WAY I'm gona show'em this movie)"
1,"Very bad,","If you had not already read the book, you would not be able to follow the story line. After Gandalf comes, the next morning the dwarves just 'appear' no knocks, rings, or any of that sort of thing. The elves look like little wizened green men and women, and quite ugly. There are no details, and some of the most important ones are not there. This is a waste of time and money, the books are a thousand times better."
2,Not the Book,"As a Tolkien fan, I found the movie very lacking.It didn't follow the story very well and left out several key parts.Other than that, it is a good movie to show 1st graders that have not read the book."
2,"Great Story, Awful Video Quality","Loved this as a cartoon as a kid.Its still the same great story.But something was lost in the video quality when getting it on DVD. Its far too dark. Any scenes where its not bright sunshiny, are in effect black such that you can only see shadows on the screen (Riddles with Gollum, Giant Spiders, meeting Smaug in the Lower Hall). Its really unfortunate.Would not recommend."
1,One Star for Quality,"I bought this because I remembered seeing this as a little kid and wanted to share the wonder I recalled with other kids. Too bad that the animation and picture quality are so poor. It's very dark. There are times when you can't really make out what is going on on the screen. High definition just exaggerates the poor quality. I wanted to love it, but that really got in the way of the overall enjoyment. The kids didn't really care too much though. The story is still good."
1,Total Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I do not agree that this DVD is the original ""unedited"" animated classic of The Hobbit. I have the original on VHS and it has better quality then this DVD. The sound skipped and some of the sound side effects were missing. Also things were added or changed. It's annoying and not worth buying. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not too Shabby,"Though a cartoon version of the J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy novel, the video does address the major events and scenes and highlights key character traits."
2,"Compared to the wonderful VHS original classic, this is a dim, hollow Dvd version","Like other reviewers, I was very disappointed by the lack of sound quality.The Story is basically the same and therefore still wonderful and enobling,but try to find an original version, rather than this DVD remastered.This one isn't worth owning."
1,awful,"this is painful to look at-avoid it like the plague-it has not much to do with the Book of the same title,except in some plot details"
1,You have got to be kidding me.,"I'll save you the money. But if you like completely horrible interpretations, give a listen to the tune, ""Frodo of the Nine Fingers"" and hear some hack vibrate through one of the worst ideas for a song in at least a century."
1,Scary as Heck,"Never before has such an evil, creepy film crossed my path. Years of psychological treatment have not undone the scarring caused by this movie. I first encountered this movie with its terrifying musical numbers and frightening characters at the tender age of 11 and I still suffer the repercussions of it. I do NOT recommend this film to anyone under the age of 17."
1,BAD COPY of a Great Movie,This is a terrible copy of a good movie. The film is dark in scenes making some of it unwatchable. Some scenes are cut together in imovie or something. Also (as mentioned in another review) some sound effects are missing. The Rankin Bass cartoon is great but this is a pirated disc or copy of a torrented file. THIS IS A BAD BUY.
2,"Story is great, DVD picture and sound quality are poor","Grew up with this movie, but unfortunately this particular DVD was poorly mastered. As others have mentioned, many scenes are so dark you can see nothing, the sound is poor such that you can barely understand most characters and, at least playing through my XBox, there seemed to be a compression issue because the video became pixelated very frequently.Nevertheless, it is worth getting for $10 just to have it in your collection since the art, narration and music are all super. If you have a VHS player, that might be a better way to go."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This is the worst picture quality on a dvd I have ever seen! Any night or dark scene, like the scene in Golem's cave, is too dark to make out anything. I wish I could have waited for the inevitable release to go along side the new movie's blu ray/dvd release. Terrible..."
5,"For Animation from 1977, this is top notch","This is obviously just an opinion, but I think that anyone who feels the urge to give this feature 1 star or less is just a biased Tolkien fan that will never be happy with any representation of his work. That said, Rankin and Bass pull off a great adaptation, with great vocal casting and solid realization of Middle Earth. I grew up watching this cartoon, and while it scared me a bit, it really captured my imagination, and got me interested in Tolkien's work. I can't wait for the movies 2001"
3,"Very good, but with a big flaw.","This is one of my favorite movies. A great story with wonderful music. This DVD seems to have a big flaw, though. Unless there is some sort of flaw in my player, a significant portion of the soundtrack seems to be missing. All of the music and dialog is there, but a portion of the soundtrack that contains a large portion of the sound effects has been left out. Things like the Eagles screaming, rocks grinding, some of Smogg's tail crashes and screams, the sounds of the eagles/goblins/and battle at the end. Their absence makes for some uncomfortably quiet spots in dramatic moments of the movie. Someone should go back and check on the master for this one."
1,It was an attempt...at most,"Ok I have read the book several times, and enjoy it. Tolkien is great. This movie is not. The plot jumps from adventure to adventure giving no time at all for anything to be enjoyed. What is with the American voices! Gandalf isn't from Alabama! The soundtrack is alright. But I can't believe that they put in that song where the goblins are chasing them with that awful 70's rock drum beat. This movie is only worth it for little kids."
1,read the book again: the pictures and music are better,"Awful. Shabby animation, horrid music (the other reviewers impugn hippies by alleging the music is somehow ""hippie-ish"").The story is cut to pieces and the ""acting"" is elementary school quality. It's obviously edited to be shown as a TV series (read: commercial schlock).It's a great story, totally trivialized by this crummy production. Avoid at all costs. The single star is the least I can give."
4,Real good classic about how the good guy uses his brains,To anyone who likes a good cartoon classic this would be one of them. Practically a Ralph Bakshi type movie only without the rated R contents.
2,What happened??,"Based on another review, I have to agree that the sound to this DVD is terrible! MANY sounds are missing! And I thought I just had a bad transfer. Why did Warner Brothers do that? I do love this movie, but the little details of sound that are missing does destroy the integrity of the movie as I remember it as a kid. You may want to just keep you VHS copies..."
2,"One of my favorite movies, but...",I loved this movie as a child. I watched it easily over 100 times on the VHS copy. The problem I have is the quality of the DVD itself. The DVD goes unnaturally dark during the night scenes causing all the detail to be removed from the movie. Since there are a lot of scenes where the movie takes place at night/in the dark about a good 50% is almost ruined.Otherwise I love the story and the songs.
3,Not the best recording,There are missing parts of the sound track and it skips and repeats. This digital copy obviously was made from an old VHS tape.
4,"Great Movie, Very Poor Copy","The animated version of The Hobbit is very entertaining and has great music. This Movies on Parade dvd is very poorly done. It is blurry, dark and hard to view. It skips in places. The dvd doesn't skip, the copy of the movie on the dvd skips. The animated movie is great and I give it five stars. This dvd version is terrible and only rates one star. Overall, I gave it four stars because I enjoyed the movie so much, in spite of the poor quality dvd. Hopefully someone will make a quality dvd and blu-ray copy of this wonderful little animated movie."
2,Needed a replacement,"I bought this movie to replace my VHS copy of it which I had watched to the point of no return. This copy isn't really worth it. If I had known that Warner Bros. had actually produced a DVD version (which they do, it's about $20), I would have boughten that instead. Honestly, the sound effects on this thing are lost which is really annoying when you're expecting them to happen. I wouldn't buy this copy of it. What I'm waiting for is when Warner Bros. releases a collection of all the cartoon Lord of the Rings series as a whole. That would be much more enjoyable as long as they are correct and the way they should be."
1,Movies on Parade VHS - terrible,"This is a wonderful animated movie in its original form. This particular product (the ""Movies on Parade"" VHS version from [...]) is terrible with poor audio and video through-out - very dark and garbled in sections. I missed the other reviews about this specific product and would not have wasted the money on it.I wish that AMAZON would sub-group reviews by actual product (not the movie, but the actual tape or DVD by a particular company) or allow a dual rating system - one for the movie and one for the media product."
1,Movies on Parade Version.,I can't speak for the other version that Amazon is going to group this review in with but don't buy the one with the Orange banner on the top that reads Movies on Parade. The video transfer to DVD is terrible. The pictures varies widely from too dark to see anything to washed out bright. The sound is just as bad. It looks like someone put a videophone on a tripod. Watched a decent recorded a decent version of the movie and then made a DVD of the recording from their phone. It is pretty much unwatchable.
2,Unwatchable,"That's more or less what this is. The picture was so bad my eyes were straining to see it, especially during the dark parts, which take up a huge chunk of the movie. No matter what picture adjustments I tried, nothing helped. Also there were places that were overlayed and there were even small pieces of scenes that were missing. The characters would be in the middle of speaking and suddenly it would jump forward a few seconds, and I know for a feact it wasn't the disc just skipping. Sad to say, I'm planning on returning this item."
3,"Love the movie, not the DVD Quality","This is a must see. Great classic movie with the songs and cartoon we all know & love from the 70s. Sadly, though, there are two spots where there is a sound glitch in the film. It isn't a skip; there are just two awkward pauses that were noticeable even to my kids, and disappointing."
2,There really needs to be a better DVD transfer than this one,"I'm a huge fan of this old Rankin Bass production. It takes a lot of shortcuts from the book and has a very different tone in places, but the designs are good and I even have a lot of fondness for the music, goofy as it can be.However, this DVD transfer is really poor. As others have said, it looks like it was just straight-up copied over from a rough VHS. There are skips and repeats, artifacts everywhere so that it looks like the lowest-res YouTube imaginable, and overall is too dark. It feels like you're watching a bootleg. I'm not entirely convinced it's a legitimate production, honestly, it's so sketchy."
1,Awful transfer,"This is an awful transfer from the original source material to DVD. Most of the film is muddy or dark, the scenes with Bilbo and Gollum being the worst. The soundtrack has several errors including gaps of silence, skips and lines being repeated. The movie itself it great, but take my advice and spend the extra few dollars to get the official Warner Bros. release. This version isn't suitable for The Dollar Store."
1,Movies on parade bootleg?,"This DVD version was horrible! I vividly remember this being a brighter video. This DVD was so dark in the scene ""riddles in the dark"" you could only see Gollums mouth. Sting didn't even glow the video is so poor. Don't buy the Movies on Parade version. The audio skipped too. So sad Amazon sold this. No stars if it was possible."
1,Bad copy,"This movie is good, but this is a review of the copy. This copy of the Hobbit is SO POOR.It looks like a rip from a dying VHS copy. It looks SO BAD. You can't even see what's going on during the dark scenes, and I KNOW it wasn't that crappy originally. I've seen the movie before, and it is not meant to look this bad. It looks like a bootleg or something, THAT BAD.I really regret not reading the reviews before ordering this..."
1,"While this is a wonderful tale and a memorable cartoon, this particular version of the product is horrible.","My review is more about the actual product, ""Movies on Parade, the Hobbit""This product looks like a bad VHS copy of a copy of a copy of a copy transferred to DVD... the colors are extremely muted, and barely anything can be seen in the darker scenes, such as Bilbo and Gollum and Mirkwood.If you can find another version I urge you to do so."
1,Very dissapointed,I bought this title in hopes that the Synergy version of this movie would have fixed the missing sound effects track which was missing on the WB version. Well it wasn't there. So do yourself a favor and don't buy this version of the DVD if you want to get the missing sound effects track.Will somebody ever fix this!!!???
3,"The movie is decent, but the book was lots better.","The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is one of my all time favorite books. I hope you all get a chance to read it sometime, for pleasure or for a class. This animated movie is better than what I expected from a cartoon, but it's still slightly geared toward little kids. It's a good compliment to the book, but to truly appreciate the storyline, it doesnt' cut the mustard. It leaves out some very key episodes and characters that were some of my favorite in the book. Where are Elrond and Beorn?!? It's a good movie that I've watched several times, and I would purchase the Lord of the Rings movies by the same people too if I ever find out that they were made. But if you really want to enjoy the story for the awesome adventrue story it is, read the book first!"
1,Not correct product.,"The product information was for The Hobbit VHS, when I received the item it was on DVD. It was for a birthday present and it's not even the correct item."
3,Not like I remember,"I read this book when I was in the 9th grade and enjoyed it very much. Our teacher showed us this movie after reading the book and I enjoyed it too. Well I ordered this movie and wow, its not the way I remember. It's a lot of singing and rhyming and it just seems like the writers may have been under the influence when they made this. Its kind of weird now and I wasn't able to watch it all.The seller was great and shipped fast."
5,A review- post viewing of the Hobbit,"Overall, it was great. I, being a hardcore Tolkien fan, judged the movie with an extremely critical eye. The songs were well done. And the animation was o.k. It really only has one plot conflict,that being that they totally left out Beorn. Oh, yeah , the elves could have been portrayed better. They look like blue ants that got tangled up in the machinery of a textile mill. Gollum was wonderful."
3,A great book dumbed down,"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a great book for kids and adults, and I highly recommend it to anyone. This movie, however, does a poor job of conveying the book. I know that a movie can never do everything a book does, but there are times when they could have done a lot better. The dwarves were OK, but Bilbo looked like a girl, the elves looked old and bent, and the goblins? What can I say, they were huge, bigger than Gandalf, their mouths were so big they could swallow a hobbit whole. Beorn was gone, too. I know this was made to be a children's movie so they have to ""dumb it down"" a little, but they could at least have been accurate."
2,Not what you'de expect,The book was for ages thirteen and up.The movie is for grade ones.Its also short and alot of the time boring.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,This DVD is terrible quality. DO NOT BUY IT. The volume on the tracks are very low and it occasionally skips as though this was copied from a poor quality VHS. Buy the re-released Warner Brothers edition from itunes its only 10 bucks.
1,not viewable,"The dvd I got is too dark and can't be seen any of my televisions, all new flatscreens. Even with the brightness turned all the way up and at night I can't see it. Obviously a waste of money since there is nothing I can do with it now."
1,Terrible DVD Transfer,"My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version, some sounds repeat. There are several points where the DVD appears to skip and replay a short sequence that it just played. The colors are extremely poor -the cave scenes are supposed to be darker but here we struggled to actually see anything that was happening. I like the film, but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy."
2,Skips,"The disc was in good condition, but the movie has obvious jumps and skips in it. It shipped quickly which I appreciated. But to have the quality interrupted was irritating."
1,Movie Butchered!,"This DVD of Rankin-Bass's ""The Hobbit"" has picture quality too dark to view, portions missing, parts repeated, cheesy transitions added, overly saturated colors, pixelation, jerky camera panning that I don't see on my VHS copy, and many sound effects missing. The company who did this, Movies on Parade, should be ashamed. I love this film and don't know why they tampered with it so much they made it unwatchable. This butchered version should not be sold or given away! This wonderful feature was ruined by an idiot ( or team of idiots ) that didn't know how to color correct or export, which is bad enough, but the spinning screen and page peel transitions were like an ungifted child doodling on a Picasso. The Warner Bros. distributed version looks a million times better but sound effects with the spiders, Smaug, and Battle of The Five Armies are missing; leaving long annoying gaps of silence. Maybe Warner Bros. will re-issue ""The Exorcist"" for kids without those scary sound effects."
2,Always liked this movie but poor video quality,I gave this item 2 stars because I do enjoy this movie. Unfortunately the quality of this video left a great deal to be desired. The picture quality was faded like it was made from an old original. It was also difficult to see in the darker scenes. There were points where the movie skipped a little or actually repeated a segment (1-2 seconds). I also noticed that there were times when the original sound effects were missing. Just a poor quality video.
1,Worst Production value I have ever seen,Avoid this edition. Audio doesn't match video all the time and fade outs for 10 second about every 20 minutes. Entire film is to dark to see most of the time. Old VHS version of this movie has much high quality video.
3,Classic,"i remember this from being a kid and thinking how great it was, well it is still a good film and classic but just makes you see how far things have come in recent years"
2,The Mighty have fallen,"I love this film and have watched it ever since I was a child. However, this version of the film has many dark scenes and is certainly not worth ten dollars. The version published by Warner brothers and Warner brothers alone is much clearer and easier to view. It is quite a bit more expensive at over thirty dollars but it's a better buy for a very clear, beautiful version that could beat out this diluted, murky version any day."
3,"Good product, sloooow delivery.","The poster is a good quality print, but by the time it arrived I had practically forgotten I had bought it!"
5,Superb!,"Without a doubt the best Bible I have ever owned. I have been studying the Bible for 24 years. I Know the NASB is supposed to be the best, but this stands side by side with it or at the worst, it comes in 2nd! However, the readability, the paper, the type, the binding and the size has the be the best on the market. I researched every other classic and thinline to compare in the ESV, the NASB, the AMP and the NLT, all of which are excellent. None compare with the style as I stated above. You cannot tell, but this is a hardback and it lies open, the pages turn easily and do not bleed through. This edition should be made also in a masculine cover. My husband wants one also, but not in this color style fabric. I offered to recover it, but that certainly would destroy the quality!"
2,Needs links to chapters!,"I should have listened to other reviews regarding the lack of chapter navigation but I really wanted an ESV Bible on my Kindle and this was the only choice.I recently started reading straight through a paper ESV version so I thought it would be great to move that reading to my recently purchased Kindle. Unfortunately, I had to page all the way from Genesis 1 to Genesis 24 by clicking next page repeatedly- that took a very long time!I really like the ESV and I probably could have given this Bible 5 stars if it just had chapter links. I hope that can be added in an update.If you need a Bible that can be quickly navigated- DO NOT buy this one. If you want to read a book from start to finish, this will do the job (you can jump to books from the table of contents)."
4,Great Bible,"I got kind of tired of other reviewers yammering on and on about the ESV translation, and hardly even mentioning the quality of this bible.This bible is very high quality. Is it perfect? No. Are any? For a bible that retails for almost $200, I expected the leather to be thicker;however, the quality and feel of the leather is very good. The paper is very good quality, not the onion-thin stuff used in numerous bibles. The font is just right - not too large, not too small.The quality of this bible is very high, and I am very satisfied with it. Is it perfect? No, not in the physical sense - it is definitely perfect as a translation from the inspired word of God.Very briefly, the ESV translation is the best translation I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It is crisp and clear and precise.Jesus is God's son. Blessed be our brother, savior, and friend."
3,Great Binding,"While the story within the book is full of contradictions that are hard to make sense of (why I gave it 3 stars), the binding is terrific! Makes a great stabilizer for my coffee table (the cover is kind of non-slip) (why I gave it 3 stars)."
4,"Good, not great Kindle Bible","We know the ESV - an excellent translation. But, how about the Kindle version? Plus side - easy to read, easy to search, highly portable. Minus side - ""folded corner"" bookmarks list by a portion of page text, not by book or verse of Scripture. In a long list of bookmarks, discerning exactly what refers to what can be quite opaque. I believe, however, that the convenience of the format outweighs this minor (and amenable to a software fix, no doubt - are you listening, Amazon?) inconvenience."
2,Too long.,"This story was wayy too long, with no real story line and the pages are wayy too thin. 2/5 stars"
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed to see a bright silver, embossed NAME across the front of the Bible, ""Dr. Joseph Sarma."" This is information that should have been given! The photo of the face of the book has been altered, if this is supposed to be the same book. Boo/hiss."
5,The King of Bibles,"This is the nicest Bible I've found yet. I love everything about this Bible; Supple Leather Cover, Perfect Font/Paper, the perfect size book for all applications. What's more the ESV is an awesome text with exceptional power and clarity of the word. This is now my default for study of the word.I still recommend the NLTse for immediacy of understanding and study of concepts such as are found in Rm 6, 7, 8. However, Bibles translations are like tools in my box, and I use most of the accepted translations at different points.NOTE: Do not use the MSG for any reason. This is not a Bible. It's a commentary and contains twisted scriptures that are used to teach false doctrines like ""felt needs"" by the Purpose Driven Cult. See Ep 4:29 MSG. Think this is a small matter? Jehovah's Witnesses do the same thing with their doctored Bible. An example is in Jn 1 where they alter the scripture to say ""and the Word was a god."" Vs was God."
5,Just what I expected,I really like the Bible. It is just what I expected. The description was true and it was just what I wanted
5,Really nice ESV Bible.,"I'm 22 never really studied the bible before and I'm interested in learning. So, I decided to search for a bible that was easy to understand and I found this one which I really really like. I love the design it looks like a journal. This can be a great gift for a young adult. It was delivered in 3 days."
5,Amazing,Love this BibleIt's thin.It's durable.It's ESV.and it has a cool flameand It's God's Word!This is a great deal!
4,Convenient little Bible,"I wanted to get a Bible that I could fit into my bag/purse. I am very happy with this Bible. The text and language/wording used is translated in a way that makes it easy to understand (ESV version). Despite the size of the Bible, which are 6 inches long and 4 inches in width, I can read the text fine but if you have problems with small words or letters you may want to stick with a full sized bible. I also enjoy the look of this and the outside cover is attractive. For me personally, I was looking for a small Bible and this was exactly what I was looking for."
3,Not for the battlezone...,"Now, it's what's inside the words of the Bible that matters, but if youre looking for a sturdy, ""battle-ready"" bible, this one may disappoint. I still think the design rocks, but the metal is rather flimsy and the latch isn't great either. I already dropped it once onto tile and the case has a slight crease.So overall, nice design, not so nice build quality"
5,Great Bible,This Bible is great when for carrying around. It looks cool and even has red-lettering for a pocket Bible. It's a great Bible and I recommend it to anyone.
3,Recommended for Christians,"Pretty decent story, but despite being quite long it manages to leave major bits of the story with the reader left wondering. A few of the vignettes are a little hard to swallow and require a bit of a leap of faith on the reader's part. Can be a bit preachy at times."
1,What Happened?,"I've been a Christian all my life but I realized I had never read the bible, so I bought it and read it front to back and its the damnedest thing... now i'm an Atheist."
4,Good Book,"It is good Bible book and I wanted ESV and that is what I get. But what disappoint me is that there is no red verses (Jesus Verses, and still looking for that one."
4,Very good Bible for the money,"I have purchased 8 of these Bibles for a prison ministry that I have gotten involved in. I wanted them to have ESV Bibles, and these are very nice. Soft covers as required by prison. They look like more expensive Bibles. My only wish is that it had cross references."
2,"Overly ambitious, inaccurate, political, immoral and archaic in language and form.","This book was extremely overly ambitious, trying to cover the origins of the universe alongside the history of Cna'an (including tiresome, somewhat alarming judicial records), all the while assuming moral and scientific superiority, without bothering to reference or prove the fantastic claims brought within.Even if we set aside the fact that most of the 'facts' related within this bronze-age book are in stark contrast to modern scientific thought, theory and fact, the format itself is somewhat archaic and unfriendly, with multiple errors and deviations on the translator(s?) side from the original Hebrew.I would not recommend this book be read to children, nor set as any sort of moral compass."
1,wasnt so great,"So alot of people I know read this one and said it was pretty great. As soon as it started off I was worried it was gonna be like that Friends episode where Rachel asked Joey to kiss her and then the whole thing is just a dream. I hate that old just a dream trick. But anyway this story wasn't at all like that. It was worse! First of all I thought he was going to fall in love with that girl but he doesn't, that was dumb why even bring her in? Then, the main guy dies in the end! Not even in the end, but he dies and the book just goes on and on blah blah blah. I haven't read any of Jamess other boks but who-ever decided to call him King should maybe thing again about that idea ha!"
4,A Good Bible,"This Bible is well-bound, easy to read and understand. When it does not give the literal meaning because of our difficulty in understanding it, it give the literal meaning on the bottom. A good Bible at a good price."
5,Reviewing a BIBLE!!!,"This is an outstanding value for anyone searching for a well-made, large-print ESV Bible without a lot of tiny-print sidenotes and cross-references to muddle the pages. I'm not sure why the publishers chose to include ""responsive readings"" in the back as that is a traditional worship activity which seems rarely used in non-Catholic churches. Overall, I couldn't be more pleased and as my local bookseller's few available large-print Bibles STARTED at the $40 range, it was a blessing to be able to purchase this one for less than $20. I'll definitely shop Amazon again!"
3,Confused,The descriptions listed by Amazon as far as font size and product dimensions are incorrect. This is a very small bible which was a little smaller than what I was looking for and the font is more a 6pt than the listed 9pt in one description. The cover is very nice however. I will keep this product I just wish it was more like the amazon description for it would be easier to read.
2,"Great translation, not so great packaging","After my dog literally ate my last Bible, I was looking for a replacement in the ESV (my favorite translation). When I came across this Bible, I thought ""Great price, I'll take it!"", but I should not have clicked on ""buy now"". The imitation leather feels terrible and the gold tipped pages also look cheap. If you are looking to give it as a gift, there is no presentation page, or place to mark down important family dates. If, on the other hand, you are looking for an inexpensive Bible that you can give away, this would be a good one to buy. I was looking for a Bible to keep for the long haul, though, so it's going back to Amazon and I will invest the extra money to have a real leather cover that I know will hold up well over many years."
5,Very Satisfied,I was very happy with this product. It came just as the description denoted. It is written in a lovely translation that brings the bible into less daunting territory without destroying any of the meaning. In my opinion it's great for all ages. For me it is a great size as well. It is light and small and fits with me wherever I go. I plan on using this bible for a long time!
5,Amazing!!!,"I just love this bible, Size is good for home and church use.Above all text size is better than readable.[...]"
4,"English Standard Version, Black Genuine Leather--Excellent Except For Leather Quality","Overall, I found the ESV genuine leather edition to be very good. The print was very clear, distinct, and seems to be pretty consistent as to darkness. It's not a red letter edition, which to me is great because, in my opinion red letter editions should be banned. The red ink is never consistently dark. The Amazon price is very reasonable. My biggest criticism is the quality of the genuine leather. It's severely lacking in quality. I have Zondervan bonded leather editions that are of better quality. I don't particularly like the feel of the paper, but I'll probably get used to it. I like the ESV translation, but the NASB is still my preferred one. The size of the Bible and the weight are pluses. It's not big and heavy, but to me, it's just right as to these aspects."
3,A Bible Sould be Readable!,"The ESV is one of the best translations of the Bible that is available. This edition is both attractive and convenient to carry, but we found that the 6.2 font is not readable without a magnifying reading glass."
3,You make the call,"This is a decent bible for the price. The cover is certainly supple and high quality. The drawback is that the inside of the bible is no different than the much less expensive genuine leather version, which costs considerably less. The paper is the same and the imprint pressure seems to be even less solid; the lettering of the genuine calfskin edition seems more faint than the cheaper versions. So you'll have to decide if you want to pay that much for an improved cover, b/c no positive changes can be found on the inside. It's exactly the same if not slightly less quality. I've owned both the genuine leather and the genuine calfskin, and consider the genuine leather to be a better value. Until Cambridge's ESV editions are released beginning in October 2008."
2,wide margin-double column?,"I recently recieved my wide margins edition of the ESV. Unfortunatley, it has double columns which makes it impossible to take effective notes on the inside column, which is the only reason people buy wide margin versions in the first place.Otherwise, it is a good bible, good translation. I like the cover and will would preaching from it if it was single column."
3,I was rather disappointed. I thought the bible I ordered had study notes with it and is was a larger print.,"rating of average. I thought it was a study bible, not a pew bible , with larger print and extensive footnotes. I also thoughtit was a 'red letter edition."
3,Bible,"I needed this version of the bible and needed it quickly. Didn't receive it as quickly as expected. When I ordered, said I would get it within days, not so. took 1 full week, so I had to go online and use that to continue with my studies. It finally arrived and it's good for the price!"
5,very good!!!,"Although it took me a little longer to get it, I think it's a good deal! Hope I can finish the whole book~~~"
4,purchased for bible study extras,"These Bibles are great to have for guests that come w\o scripture in hand. Easy to read font, index,etc. Thank you for an affordable option."
3,Beware: 8-point type is tiny,"You get what you pay with a Bible that only costs $6.99, so I can't complain about the fragile quality of this small, paperback Bible. And, I can't complain that the type is too small, because the type size is in the description of the product. I will warn those who don't read the description or who don't know that size 8 type is tiny, if really small print bothers you, select a different Bible. Furthermore, don't expect this Bible to hold up very long to the wear and tear of regular Bible study (more than once a week)."
4,average Bible,Not the best. Not the worst. I had to buy this for a class and some of the material is in conflict with my beliefs. I prefer Catholic Bibles.
4,Glad to find this,"I hope Crossway will get this back in print. I bought this copy for my wife who had worn out her previous copy. It is a great size for study, or teaching & preaching."
5,Great Value!,"This is DEFINITELY worth the price. It's the only bible I could find under $15 and it's just as good as a $30 one (without the added bible studies and whatnot).It's also the perfect size for taking around with you, but not too small to read!"
5,I love it,"This Bible is a perfect size for the front pocket of my book bag, and it looks and feels great in the hand. It is strong enough to endure my 5 year old pretend to know how to read it, and a wonderful translation that I love to read for real."
4,Good reference Bible,"Excellent translation.Very readable size font.Only 1"" margin on outside. An inside margin would have been very helpful since text is two columns."
5,"Truely, worth the price","The Holy Bible: English Standard Version, Compact TruTone Edition (Chestnut Diamond Design, Red Letter)"
4,Good inexpensive ESV Bible,"I was looking for a decent, non-paperback ESV Bible and this was one of the least expensive and I liked the color and design of the the cover (Trutone, Midnight, Flame). When I got it in the mail I was pretty pleased. It looks and feels nice and I am surprised it is only 11 bucks on Amazon. The pages are easy to read and the typeset looks very clean, simple, and modern. There is even a nice concordance in the back which might be useful for some people. It doesn't have red-lettering but that's why it's so cheap I guess. Also, the size of the Bible is not as compact as some of the pocket Bibles out there, but that's the tradeoff for having easily readable print. As I said, the Trutone cover is nice, but of course won't be as durable as genuine leather. For the money, this Bible has a pretty good value, I like it a lot."
5,"A great translation and a handy, attractive design","Since discovering the ESV, I have been highly impressed with its attention to detail and literality, while still being beautiful and accessible. In my mind, the ESV has the accuracy of the NASB mixed with the readability of the NIV, making it the best English Bible translation out there.As for the design, I find it excellent. From the unique font (Garamond) to the Trutone cover (that feels really good, by the way), this Bible is beautiful. The design is elegant, yet functional, and the size makes it very transportable. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a Bible that is faithful to the original languages while staying readable in English (though if you have a hard time reading small print, you ought to get the slimline edition instead)."
5,Awesome Little Bible,"I was sooo happy to find this pocket ESV. I wanted something the size of a Gideon Bible. This is about the same size. The text is easy to read and the size is perfect for a back pocket or purse. I found the pages to be thick for the size, the Bible feels and looks very durable and the cover is super soft and flexible. Great Bible, great buy!"
5,Small print is hard to read,"I should have read the description carefully. I am impressed with the ESV translation, but If you are over 40 better get the larger print version."
2,Illegible,"Break out your magnifying glass when you read this Bible. The print is tiny and the patges are thin so that the next page shows through. This compact version is a bit too compact. It's fine for readers with healthy eyes under age 40, yet the pages seem fragile and I question how well this version holds up with prolonged use. Back to the order page for me. I need to find one that I can read easily and that will last for the remainder of my life."
3,Wrong Size,I got this particular Bible to go along with the Child Training Bible Kit as recommended on their website. This is supposed to be large enough to fit the inserts I ordered for the CTB but it is not.
4,Perfect-sized Bible,"I bought this Bible as a gift, and I was completely thrilled with it. It is small enough to carry with you but large enough for at home study. The print was larger than I expected, and the pages were not too thin. The cover work was very nicely done; my friend was very pleased with this Bible!"
3,Great for getting back into Church...,"I got this for myself for Christmas...My husband and I were out of the Church scene for quite awhile and we finally found one that works for us. I however, had not had a bible for a long while. I am very happy with my purchase and can't wait to open my present."
5,Great Value,"I've had mine for about a year now and the only thing i wish it had was reference. I really wish that. Otherwise it has good sized print, not the 12.75pt that the Giant one has but a bit smaller. I used to always buy the leather bound but i found that i prefer hard-cover because it's easier to grab since it doesn't spill out of the hand as easy. I like it and i'm getting another one :), one for the lunch breaks that stays in the car and the other one for everything else."
4,Differences from the Black Trutone Version,"I own dozens of Bibles...discovered the ESV and the single column and decided to give it a try (wanted a break from Study Bible type bible with other persons opinions)....love, love, love the single column...so easy for personal study as well as to follow in church...room for personal notes...I ordered the Brown Trutone one first, but, like another commentary, I found that the window indention came through on the trutone cover and didn't come out...secondly, the brown one is sewn binding, has heavier paper than the black version & consequently, is 1/4 to 1/2 inch thicker than the black. I decided to return because of the intention on the cover and get it in the black binding...although not sewn, love the binding and the smaller thinner version."
4,Easy Accessibility,"The compact ESV that I have purchased has proven to be a great asset in my business travels. I am able to carry it in my jacket pocket with no problems. It provides access to God's Word when I need it, particularly for the purpose of evangelism. And, of course, the readability of the ESV is par none."
5,"Nice, cheap bible to have around. Like the translation","I bought this for a friend of mine. It's a pretty standard paperback version of the ESV Bible. I think it's kinda becoming a new standard translation, replacing the NIV in a lot of places. I think it's a good solid version."
4,"Excellent edition - readable, portable, useful","This paperback edition is excellent, and I like it even better than the Outreach edition. In all ESV editions, the typesetting is very beautiful, and that goes a long way when reading a paperback.The extra intros and essays are just what I would want to be included in a true ""Outreach"" edition. I plan to keep a few on hand to give seekers and others who would like a Bible.It is hard for me to find a Bible that has readable type but is still portable. This is about the closest I've gotten. I have 4 or 5 of the compact ESVs, and other small Bibles. Crossway hasn't quite given me the combination of compactness and readability I desire, but I commend them for this one, and hope to see them aim closer to this goal.I read this on the subway. Highly recommend the translation to you; buy this edition if you don't want to risk a lot of money. You can buy the more expensive versions later."
5,easy to read,"I find this printing of the ESV to be very easy to read. The font is not bold, but still crisp and highly legible. The text printed on the other side of the page only faintly shows through the paper and doesn't interfere with reading. A sample of the text is available on the publisher's website.(ESV Pew and Worship Bible, Large Print, Black Hardcover, ISBN 9781581349047)"
4,Great reference Bible,"This is a great Bible for just reading. I've heard great reviews on the ESV version from top biblical scholars like John MacArthur so I was anxious to receive it. After daily reading for a few weeks now I absolutely love it. Also, the leather and binding of the Bible is very good. I'm glad I made this purchase."
4,"Small, but compact!","Although this bible was a little smaller than I expected, I really love it! It's great for bringing to church (fits right in my purse) and my husband loves to use it for his train ride into work. Love the ESV translation too!"
4,Great form factor okay translation,"This is the smallest complete Bible I have found that is not a KJV. It is wonderful. It fits in my pants or jacket pocket easily. The one downside is the ESV translation. While this translation is fairly word for word, it seems to go out of its way to be obtuse at certain points. I do not know if this translation will ever gather the following it is hoping for. But if you don't mind a few difficult phrasings and occasional instances of reworded familiar passages than this Bible is perfect for travelling or taking God's Word with you wherever you go."
2,Caution before downloading,"The Kindle Touch version has been problematic for me. I can find no Table of Contents, and no listing for the all important abbreviation needed for ""this book."" I appreciate that the download was free, now I know why. Discouraged."
4,Great Bible but not large print!,"I purchased this Bible with the intent of using it when I was preaching or teaching in front of people so I could read the words more easily than I could with my regular thinline ESV. When I got the Bible in the mail I was a little disappointed because the print is no bigger than my thinline, which is definitely not large print. So, just a heads up, while this is a great Bible, if you're getting it for the large print, it's not that large. It is very well put together, though, with a nice cover and binding and a brown cloth strap to keep your page."
5,This bible is a great value,I am shocked at how nice the cover and the bible over all is even though it is under $10! I have bought other under $10 bibles but the cover is always cheap looking imitation leather that is very stiff. But this bible is so nice and I may have to buy a few more to give away to family and friends.Great translation and a great cover makes a very good bible and for the price you can't beat that. If you are looking for a very good affordable bible I strongly recommend you order one of these or even if you already have one! because this bible is very nice to take with you since its very thin but yet the pages are nice and bright.I give this bible 10 stars!
2,Print is much smaller than I was expecting,"I bought the ESV Holy Bible (Contemporary Design) Paperback version, and it's very disappointing. Though the cover design is nice, the print is much smaller than I expected, considering the digital previews of inside the book made it look like the print was a good size."
3,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"This bible is a beautiful mahogany brown with lovey and intricate detail on the cover. However, it is very stiff and the pages are a very poor quality. I love to underline and take notes in my bible, but even pencil bleeds through these pages to the point it is hard to read the opposite page. The size is great, but there is no cross reference. There is a nice concordance in the back and the translation is a very easy and accurate read. I highly recommend an ESV, but just not from this publisher. You really do get what you pay for.ESV Value Thinline Bible (TruTone, Chestnut, Filigree Design)"
4,"nice, high quality",but my eyes are getting to old to read the tiny print. It is nicer than I expected.
5,Great Bible if you need a small one.,"I used this to read a verse at a wedding in France. I, of course, did not want to carry a large Bible from the USA to France. It was the perfect size. Although, a little small in print but I knew that going in. It worked perfectly and everyone was pleased. I then gave it to the bride and groom as part of their wedding present."
3,The Only Flaw is the Tiny Print,"It's good to see the ESV gaining traction in the market. This is a beautifully bound compact Bible, with excellent reference notes and a remarkably complete concordance. Small enough to fit into a typical ladies purse, it's a convenient size to take on the train or bus. But the print is extremely small and takes some getting used to. It's a shame the publisher didn't make the Bible even slightly larger; I think it would have been a runaway best seller. As it stands, I can only give it 3 stars...the print is just too small."
2,Not quite the Clear Word,"Please don't misunderstand me. I love the ESV translation; however, this copy was pretty poor. There are a number of places where the ink apears to be smugged, making it difficult to read--my very reason for buying a large print Bible. I would not have sold this copy as new, commercial quality."
5,A Great Little Bible,"The ESV Compact Bible was just what I wanted-----small enough to fit in my purse and readable. Although the font is small, I can see it just fine with my prescription glasses. The leather binding and feather-light pages add a richness to the reading of Scripture."
4,Great price -- small type,"This Bible is really inexpensive. The typeface is really small and hard to read for older readers. For younger readers, however, it is great."
3,Large Print?,"being that I work for a publishing company we would not consider 8.5 to be ""large print""...but the Bible was beautiful and put together well."
2,Not a Large print in my opinion.,"I don't know why would someone call it a Large print. It's a bit larger than a regular, but not what I expected. Returning it."
1,Too hard to read.,"I returned it. The print is too hard to see, the cover is too thin, and I didn't like the paper it was printed on."
5,Awesome,"My sister's been wanting a Bible she can carry around and read daily. This works great - easy to read, portable, contemporary, great for a young person!"
3,Difficult Font but a Great Translation,"I bought this because it has the largest font of any of the ESV editions. However, I still find it difficult to read. It's not a particularly small font. And in any case I don't normally have trouble with small print. So I presume it's the style, rather than the size, of the font. I do hope they come up with something easier on the eyes. I'll stick with my old RSV till I get an ESV that's as easy to read."
2,Font is way too small - returned product!,"I was eager to purchase this bible because of other reviews...The ESV's language and apparent accuracy was a draw for me. However, when I received this product, I was very dissapointed. The font was TINY and after attempting to read this bible, I felt frustrated and put it down. Not a feeling you want to have during bible study."
3,ESV Pew Bible Regular Print,This is a great Pew Bible. I bought this and the large print. Had I seen them beforehand I would have only bought the Large Print because it is so much nicer but also $5 more. I have the budget and space so the little bit more and the minor increase in size would not have mattered and I would have purchased all of the Pew Bibles that I purchased as the Large Print.
1,Lol the Bible sucks,"Responsible for hate, bigotry, and false beliefs for thousands of years. It is literally nothing more than a giant fantasy book for adults. If you believe in fairy tales and santa, you'll believe this too."
1,Not that great.,"I didn't buy this exact book, but I had one similar to it. Would not read again. Very violent, contains incest, beastiality, murder, horrible things that shouldn't be so available to everyone immediately. Promised salvation, so I thought a tv would be okay, but didn't deliver. As far as I can tell, this is just firelighter paper. Don't recommend."
1,Terrible read. I do not recommend it.,"I wanted to start reading this because of all the good reviews, but it was terrible. The name of the author is not put there. One dimensional characters, no plot, contradicts itself over, and over. This god character makes no sense. Contradicts modern science. It's just terrible, it promotes genocide, slavery, killing, killing, and more killing, hate, and bigotry. It's a waste of 10 dollars that you could otherwise be buying a better book."
3,Toe cushion,Not what I expected. Not interchangeable between feet. Liked that it was silicone. Less irritating to skin. Wouldn't buy another.
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this item, but it just didn't measure up. It does not stay in place, and it feels like you are walking with a foreign object under the ball of your foot."
4,pedifix gel toe cushion,I bought this for my dad who has some problems with his toes. This product keeps them straighter and seems to help him. Good price and fast shipment.
1,Steel shouldn't Break,I purchased these in June of 2009 and installed them on my truck to give my truck more support to haul my 31ft. 5th wheel. Today 6/13/2011 a 6 inch piece of one of the leaf spring helpers broke off while I was driving down the road. Lucky for me and other traffic it happened while I was on a less traveled road and only going about 25 mph. These leaf spring helpers are only 2 years old and they broke. I guess they are not made of quality steel. I don't recommend them.
5,Fantastic Item,"This purchase exceeded my expectations, with this item i can control my Ipod thru the receiver and view all the tracks etc on my TV screen.Oh did i mention the clarity of the music......."
4,Ipod User MUST,"With over 8,000 songs on my Ipod I couldn't imagine NOT adding this dock to my new Yamaha Surround Sound Receiver. It works just as advertised. One feature that puts it ahead of previous ""docks"" I've used is that the controls (wheel) on the Ipod itself still operate while the thing is docked. The ""on screen display"" to my LCD TV is not as ""pretty"" as I would have liked, but it gives you all the information you want; and song titles ""scroll"" on the front display of the receiver as well. It also charges the Ipod while it is docked. I don't have any videos on my Ipod yet, so I can't say what will happen with that in the ""on screen"" mode. But since I just wanted it for my music, it is superb."
4,Works like a charm,While yes you do have to read 3 sections of the AMP manual to figure it all out. Once it was working - it works like a charm.
3,auto shut off,"the first few weeks were fairly flawless.then, i noticed, with my ipod on the dock, whether i was listening to music or watching tv, having my generation 2 ipod nano on the dock auto shuts off my entire receiver. i have this dock paired with the Yamaha HTR-6040BL 5.1-Channel Digital Home Theater Receiver.i have taken my ipod off the dock and i watched tv as normal ...hopefully the problem does not resurface.i guess i can also try upgrading itunes software to 7.5** UPDATE *** * later today, i think i solved my problem... somehow, my ipod was in sleep mode * * i think that ipod sleep mode puts the whole receiver to sleep... will keep you updated.** UPDATE ** 07/03/2010Dock works great. The Auto Shut Off problem was there was faulty wiring in my HTR-6040BL receiver. I got it fixed under warranty and there have been ZERO issues!!Currently, i am docking a iPhone 2G to the dock with zero issues.I can even run Pandora through my receiver!!"
4,Great Option for the Yamaha Receiver,"The concept of the IPOD dock is simply great. I was surprised to learn that it is an available option AFTER we bought the receiver. It's such an important accessory, that one would think the Yamaha marketing folks would have included it in the point of sale materials. Go figure.Anyway, it is simple to install and easy to use. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an IPOD.Playing music from the IPOD is certainly easier than selecting CD's to play and then inserting them into a CD changer.Now that we have the IPOD dock, we may no longer need to have a multi-CD /DVD player. When it comes time to upgrade to a Blue-ray, we may only need the single CD/DVD player which will $ave a few shekels."
5,Yamaha YDS-10 Universal iPod Dock,This dock works great with my receiver. I tried a different dock prior to using this which had a poor sound quality (analog). Sound quality with this dock is excellent.
3,Disappointed,"I already had a dock for my iPod, but I thought that this one would be superior. Not to be. The only reason for using this one is to save an input on my RX-V659, which almost has too few to begin with. The audio is passed as analog from this dock. I thought (silly me) that it would pass a digital signal. A friend reminded me, though, that the RX does not decode MP3, etc., so I am not so disappointed as I was about this. The quality of the sound is not nearly so good as it is through my other (DLO) dock for the iPod. For the final blow, I am also disappointed in the the remote control. It took a little digging in the RX manual (no mention in the YDS-10's) to figure out how to control the iPod from the RX's remote. Then I find out that you cannot select a video to view from the remote. You must do this through the iPod's select wheel.If you can't tell already, order the DLO. Their best one is a few dollars more, but well worth it."
5,Exactly as advertised,I guess you can't say anything better than--works exactly as advertised. Quick set-up with my Yamaha 2700 receiver. I highly recommend buying online b/c I'd have to lower the number of stars if I paid retail.
4,Yamaha ipod dock,"Easy to connect, GUI display is clear and easily readable from a distance, and the remote of my Yamaha RX-V2700 is responsive. You can select the option to charge as well. You have to enable video output to see the video on another monitor.The only thing it DOES NOT seem to do, is to go the next level up from music i.e. video, photos (via the remote). You can manually watch video/photos (if you have those features on your ipod) by physically using the click-wheel and then you can stop/start the video with the remote. That last shortcoming prevents it from attaining a ""5""."
3,Just OK,This iPod dock works ok for newer iPods however it does not work for earlier generation iPods.
2,no menu,"The main thing I bought this for is to control my Ipod. Which you can do but no menu on the tv to control it. It is very hard to see an ipod 10' away. Also there is a high pitch sound when you change songs, that lasts for a second or two. I have everything hooked up correctly and settings set."
3,Not quite there,"While the YDS-10 performs all audio functions as expected, and the on screen menus are a big plus, it misses with video. You still have to use the click wheel to play music videos, and pictures. I like to play a slideshow of my pictures while listening to music, and music videos are why I bought the video IPod. I have to use the the click wheel for anything concerning pictures. That's not exactly what I'd hoped for. I wanted to use the on screen menus and make selections from a distance rather than going back and forth from the TV and stereo. If you're looking for audio only, this is it. If you have a video IPod, the YDS-10 will leave you disappointed."
1,MISLEADING/FALSE PRODUCT ADVERTISEMENT,"I am a little confused. The camera I ordered that was advertised online, is not the camera I recieved via UPS. I was aware that the camera might not come in the color advertised. But it was certainly suppose to come in the same style. (The Minolta Freedom 70 QD Date 35mm Camera) Instead, I recieved a Minolta Freedom Zoom 70ex.What happened? I did recieve the camera bag at no extra charge. Thank you. But my concern is not recieving the camera I ordered!"
2,toy,"this camera is so behind its unbelievable..bad pictures, not enough featuresi gave mine to my 4yr old neice"
5,Exceptional,"This was an exceptional book. It was okay for most ages, it reminded me of Marion Zimmer Bradley books, but Rebecca has a style of her own. The unlikely hero thing was great, Tigrallef was funny and serious, all at once. It was great."
4,Great book: but you must read the sequel too,"Lady in Gil is a wonderful story. It has the usual unlikely hero plot but isn't that what makes books fun? The main character Tigrallef is fun and easy to relate to. Another main character Calla is a great mysterious character who keeps you guessing at what she is really thinking right up to the end. The setting is great. Who can resist an underground movement with secret hand signals and undercover agents? The book is fun as I have said but what I like is a little bit of realism that makes it feel as if what you just read was real and Rebecca Bradley did this. Unfortunately most readers will be very angry at her when you finish this book (don't worry I wont give away the ending) but if you do read it (and please do)just read the sequel ""Scions Lady"" and the urge to strangle the author will pass. So after all that : this is great book and definetly worth your time"
3,Reluctant Hero,"This is your typical reluctant hero story. It was interesting enough to keep me reading and finish the book. I gave it three stars because it was a good story, but it lacked the gripping feeling that leaves me wanting more."
1,Not for me.,"I am an adult. This book was not for me. It is a story of a fairly-typical reluctant hero. The main character is serious, but juvenille. Young teen readers may find this book attractive, but for other adult readers: stay away."
1,a disappointment,"with the addition of carol berg's books i was hoping that amazon was finally reccommending stuff for me that i would like, but lady of gil turned out to be a real disappointment. it is extremely plot driven, whereas i prefer character driven work. in addition, the characters are unbelievable and the plot cheesy. the author seems entranced with her own cleverness, and i didn't think she was very clever. figures with authority have titles like ""primate"". there is no reason to feel fear or care about the characters and i put the book down before finishing."
5,Awesome for a CASIO,"I have to admit that I have owned Casios' in the past, but this one really stands out. It is super accurate since it uses the atomic time frequency to update itself 4 times a day. Even if you miss a update, all you have to do is hit a button and it will do it for you manually. The watch is smart enough to keep up to date with the new daylight savings time laws in the US, and you will amaze your friends when you show off the complex stop watch on this thing. This watch is not to heavy, nor too flimsy. I've had mine for about 5 months+ and no scratches yet."
4,Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (2003 Edition,Speedy transaction - well packaged - as reported condition - would do business with again. Thanks
3,"Good cookbook, but questionable illustrations","I picked this up from the library a few days ago. I couldn't tell that it was a vegan cookbook by the title, but I could tell that it would appeal to my fifteen- and nine-year-olds. I was right. The recipes were easy enough to follow- and the write-ups compelling enough- that my daughters were salivating over many of the recipes despite the lack of photos.However, I found the illustration used for the Asian dishes offensive. It was a caricature of an Asian man, presumably Chinese, with a long mustache and traditional straw hat. Was that really the best they could do for Asian dishes? They didn't include similar illustrations for Mexican and Italian dishes, FYI.Good recipes, but I'm glad they didn't get any of my money."
2,Apes and Angels: A Review,"Having admired Connell's famous short story ""The MOst Dangerous Game"" which told of a crzed hunter named Zaroff who lived on a deserted island and spent his time hunting humans, I had great expectations for this work. However, the stories in here do not measure up to Connell's most famous story, i.e. ""The Most Dangerous Game, and I would advise that unless you are a die-hard Connell fan or have an interest in short stories written during the 1920's and 1930's, you bypass this work and reread ""The Most Dangerous Game."""
5,THIS CD IS FANTASTIC.,EVE HAS A WAY OF EXPRESSING HER ALL IN EACH SONG. SHE HAS ALWAYS HAD THE TALENT TO SING.
3,Don't shy away from this one Taylor fans.,"Yes, its really a glossy soap opera, but then what's wrong with that? You'll love Taylors 'ugly ducking to graceful swan' transformation, her romantic liasons and the beautiful Swiss scenery. Should be rated SR - Sherry required for best viewing experience."
5,"Trippy, campy, and furry","This was Dominick Dunne's offering to the world before he cleaned up his substance abuse problem (he admits to this). I, for one, am glad he was still ""doin' his thang"" while he produced it, because its bizarre emphasis on the power--and surgical gore--of the facelift would have been lost otherwise. The film has a voyeuristic, look-at-that-car-crash-honey quality to it, and Liz ""before"" the facelift is a hoot to see. Deeeeelish!"
1,"This film had a point to make, but we lose interest right..","from the beginning. Because the film is so boring, we don't really care to know what the point was.ASH WEDNESDAY is about a middle-aged woman, who is undergoing a middle-age crisis, elememts of which include her having an extensive plastic surgery and a young lover. It is a ""we have to value what we've got"" sort of thing.Except for the great Henry Fonda, who appears only in couple of scenes, all actors are complete ham. I did not feel any genuine emotion coming from the screen, I didn't laugh, and I was not entertained. On my list, these are the characteristics of a bad movie. I am sorry to hurt the feelings of all die-hard Elizabeth Taylor fans: she is a true star, but even her costumes could not save this film. It is dull and pretentious!"
4,Cobra CB Radio,This radio works very well and is very easy to install. I like it very much as you can move it from vehicle to vehicle in just a few minutes.
4,Gift,"I purchased this as a gift over xmas, so I have no real review other than I would buy one for myself. Familiar w/the brand and it's use as I have used them for years. Seems it would be good for most any application, 4WD off road keep in contact with others in a group when 4W 'ing. ATV'ing. Easier to use and to install. No bulky unit to try and stuff under today's plastic dashboards."
3,"Easy install, but hoped for better usability","Installation was a breeze...I really hoped for better reception and transmissions. I did go to a CB shop after installation to have the Wilson 5000 Roof Top Mount CB Antenna tuned, but I still have less the desired performance. For the most part it serves the purpose of close range communication when stuck in traffic and wanting to know what the hold up is or which lane I need to be in. My biggest complaint is the lack of a RF Gain. It's not bad if you want an easy install without sacrificing space, just don't expect the same quality as the Cobra 29 LTD Classic."
4,"Good, not perfect","We use the unit in a Corvette, and there is no convenient place to mount a regular CB; the Cobra solves that problem nicely. We had the local stereo shop install a cigarette lighter plug on the Cobra power cord so we just plug it into a lighter outlet. The built in speaker is rather weak, we bought a Cobra S500 external speaker that sits on the shelf behind the driver seat and works very well. The volume and squelch controls are sometimes moved by accident when handling the unit. We removed the hanger stud on the back of the unit and put a piece of fuzzy velcro there, a mating piece of hook velcro on top of the console keeps the unit handy. These units seem rather short-lived, ours are heavily used about 2 weeks per year but just sit in the car the rest of the time, two previous units both died at 3 years.Summary- not perfect, but the best solution available for our situation."
5,Great product,This CB radio is excellent!!! It is great for small spaces and perfect for all-in-one conditions!
3,So-so,The speaker is very bad! If you try to communicate it is hard to understand any one. Most people do not us e the CB any longer anyhow
4,Nice basic starter unit. Easy hookup.,"This is definately NOT a professional unit. Its great for the occasional CB'er. We noticed about a 1 mile range on our whip antenna which is mounted on top of our motorhome. Probably could get better range with better antenna. Dont need more than that. Easy to hookup and VERY CLEAN look - that is my favorite part. Internal speaker is ""ok"" but not for the hard of hearing."
1,Worked for two weeks,Handset is bulky and not comfortable to use. Speaker in handset sounded terrible while it worked. After two weeks the radio no longer produces any sound. Everything lights up like it thinks it's working but there is no sound at all.I hope I can just return this item for a refund
2,Died after 6 months,"Purchased Cobra 75 WX ST All-in-handset Mobile CB about 1 year ago. Easy installation, up-front controls, very convenient. Six months after installation speaker in mike failed, could only get sound through external speaker, using external jack. Repair shop said it would cost almost as much to fix as the unit cost."
5,Excelent for ATV,I have been using this for a couple months on my Honda Rincon Quad and its amazing. Great sound and reception with my ground mounted CB antenna. Just Gotta Keep It From getting soaked. Easy to disconnect Mic when not in use.
3,"It's OK, ergonomics aren't so good.","This unit itself is OK, it works just fine. Ergonomically it's a pain to use. The unit is much larger than a mic and it's a handful to hold. The thumb trigger for the microphone is tiny and hard to feel for while driving; it's a rubber pad, not a real button. Had I known these things I would have gotten a regular CB. But it's a quality unit, well-built and functions just as well as any other stock CB I've ever used."
4,"Did not want a ""big box' cluttering things up","Did not want a ""big box' cluttering things up so opted for the hand held. Works just like the big ones but the small speaker is a bit tinny with volume so needs to be close. Got a small external speaker and am happy with the sound. Range seems to be pretty good with a 12 inch rubber whip so would be way good w/regular antenna. Overall I am satisfied and would purchase again"
5,Cobra 75WXST 40-Channel CB Radio,"Great product. Easy to install. I replaced a traditional CB with this one and was amazed how much room the old CB was occupying. The remote connector box is so small, it fits anywhere.Amazing shipping from Amazon."
4,Very nice general use CB,4 stars because I have not been able to use it much. The concept is good. In my application the microphone pig tail on the AC 701 could have been about six inches longer but purchased the 4ft straight extensions to aid in the install. I do like the features of scan and weather channels.
2,out of freq.,i bought one of these .it worked fine for about 4 hours and all the sudden it went off of freq very scrachey sounding sending back asp.
1,Power from vehicle battery,"I was looking forward to using this product. When I received the CB Radio I find that it does not plug into the cigarette lighter as I thought, it connects directly to the vehicle battery. Can't do that so it is going back. I give Amazon one star for not making this clear."
5,Great CB for every vehicle.,"I have had these installed in every vehicle owned for several years now. They hold up over time and have not failed me yet. The CB handset has all features included, the power and antenna connector boxes can be bought separately, and are easy to install. Just be sure to use a good antenna. Weather feature and noise canceling work as advertised. The black plastic of the handset, while looking somewhat cheap has held up well. The yellow back light could use a brightness setting though. Very nice radio. I have replaced all others with these.4 watts output, loud audio, easy to use and install. Will last for years of use. You need these in all vehicles!Works well for logging roads and back roads. How many times have you seen a sign on a logging road with a CB channel on it and not gone since you had no way to tell where the trucks were? Get one of these."
4,Cobra 75WXST All-in-Handset Mobile 40-Channel CB Radio,This product is simply wonderful if you are worried about security. I own a Jeep and having the ability to quickly disconnect this unit and store it my lockable console is truly a peace of mind type feeling. I haven't tuned the antenna yet so reception is a little bit messy but it picks up eveything from my runs with my club and transmits great. My hands are fairly large so gripping and using the handset is fairly easy but someone with small hands might have some problems with all of the buttons and dials.
4,Installed in 2004 Miata,I use this CB in Miata road rallies. I mounted the hand-held unit between the two seats on the back panel. It can be heard easily in normal driving conditions without the need for an external speaker.
2,Limited use,"Small Wood Handle is an understatement. I can only close three fingers on the handle. I carry the knife on my tool belt and use it on rough odd jobs. It is very satisfactory for digging up grass burrs. The stainless steel blade is easy to sharpen, but it dulls quickly - no thanks to my abusive use. It has a very long way to go to reach the level of any of my hunting knives. I purchased three of them on a clearance sale. If you are only considering value for the dollar, it would rate four stars."
2,Great movie. Very poor quality,"I love this movie, yet the recording is extremely poor. It looks like it was recorded off of tv and is a bad tape. Very disappointed with the quality. The shipping was quick."
1,"Poor design, save your money","If you are trying to save yourself some work forget about buying this product. The design is very poor and apparantly not properly field tested before it was put on the market. The unit will get stuck (everytime) on the corner of the pool steps(and every pool has steps). It then sits in that position and grinds away at your pool finish and the unit itself. I haven't had mine for 6 months and the unit is worn down where it rubs against the steps. I must then be constantly be fishing the unit out of its stuck position. I have now resorted to lowering a stone-filled empty detergent bottle in that corner to try to get the unit to bypass the corner....ugly. P.S. it doesn't even pick up medium sized leaves, they all get stuck at the bottom."
2,Weak fragrance,"The lemon citrus scent is weak compared to the other scents out there. On a brighter note, the candle itself is long-lasting."
1,Smells horrible - NOT like green tea at all,"I've been searching high and low for a green-tea scented candle. I have found a lot of ""green tea/citrus"" and scents like that, but not just simply ""green tea"". So when I found this one, I bought it right away. None of the other reviews I read, even negative ones, seemed to mention Beanpod candles smelling gross. So I bought it. Candles cost too much as it is, but when I spend 20 bucks and then get something like this, I'm very disappointed.It did not smell like green tea in the slightest. The best I can come up with to describe the smell (which I could smell before even opening my package when it came in the mail), was some cross between AXE Body Spray and campground latrine disinfectant. It stung the nostrils. Just awful. I don't know how anyone could find this scent enjoyable, let alone claim that it smells anything like green tea."
4,smells good,really like this fragrance have used other ones wanted to get aquanity but read one review hadnt burned properly was a different fragrance so ordered 2 am on first one burned ok a slight wax left on side of jar. went tpo order more and had to get preships for same price we paid first time. so we are awaiting our next shipment . we are happy at prices. glad to find your web sight.
5,Movie Buff,"This is an excellent DVD set. This should be in everyone's movie collection! This DVD has great actors/actress that do awesome roles with their charaters that they play. If you like/love to watch movies that can/will put you on the edge of your seat with action, then this is the DVD set to watch!"
3,Painfully Honest Look at Life in Spanish Harlem,"This is a sort of ""autobiography"" based on Piri Thomas' life in Spanish Harlem. Thomas, a Puerto Rican, becomes involved in drugs, crime, and violence -- then ending up in prison. The manner in which he describes the events make you feel as though you've been there. It's a really ugly scene, but it's told extremely well and will keep you reading. The writing is so candid it's refreshing."
2,Required reading,This was a required reading for a college class for grandson. Not the type of book he really enjoys reading on a regular day.
5,This Book is RAW....,"Piri Thomas is a great writer. From the First page this book had me hooked. His writing is so descriptive it was like watching a movie in my head....As he describes his early life and adolescents in the barrio you feels as thou your right there...He holds nothing back, the language is raw and he keeps it real.... I would definitly recommend this book......A++"
4,Down These Mean Streets,My boyfriend love this book. I glad I was able to get it for his birthday...Thanks
1,Encounter With Alien Man,"I would not recommend ""Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet"" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in 1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins, mankind's religions, mankind's future, etc. ======= If I were to only judge the insights that this book provides into the awesome technology and power exhibited by aliens, a well as the awesome influence that aliens can wield upon human beings, I would have to give the highest rating available (five stars). However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled ""The Sacred And The Profane"", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message."
1,you gotta know when to fold em Kenny,Ugh! Kenny Rogers doing a Whitney Houston ballad? He doesn't have the voice for any of these songs. Stick to what you know Kenny.
3,I have had better,They are the basic sesame stick. I have had better ones but atleast they do not contain any of those yucky ingredients that are so bad for out bodies.
4,Cullin's best,"Both poetic and thrilling, the best thing about this novel in the texture: the language and visual imagery are both stunning. This is a wonderful take on a twisted childhood, and so it's no surpirise Terry Gilliam will direct the movie version: the surreal and dreamy misprision is right up his alley. One might quibble that the voice of the narrator in the novel would be beyond that of a child, but the payoff of the reading experience is probably worth the suspension of disbelief."
3,Power Wrapper Not very Durable,"I've been looking for something like this for some time. The Power Wrapper is a great idea - if only it were built with more durable materials. It is all plastic. I believe even the gears inside are plastic. I rolled about $40.00 in change, and it began making strange noises. The money kept getting stuck inside. The company must have had problems with it before because they sent extra troubleshooting tips in the box. The tips did not help. The design is a great idea, would be fun for helping kids keep their money. Try again Mag-Nif Inc!"
2,Power Wrapper not a durable machine.,"I bought this PowerWrapper toy for myself. My 3 & 5 year old kids thought it was great fun to put coins in the bin and watch them sort. But after a month, the digital reader stopped working correctly. The flimsy metal tabs that record the number of each coin type wore out quickly, so the amount shown on the digital reader is worthless. After about six months the motor jammed, and I've been unable to use it since. They make a model without the digital counter, and I would recommend that one over this one. But as far as durablility, I give it a 2. If you are only going to throw your pocket change in it, then it's great fun. For anything else, buy something else that will last."
1,TERRIBLE,This product last maybe a week before it broke. Would not do more then 2 or 3 coins at a time. It is easier to sort the coins by hand!!!
3,The groundbreaking B.A.R.F. book...,"Yes, it is terribly written. It is also confusing - often contradicting information is presented. BUT this is the book that got tens of thousands of people taking a very hard look at how they have been feeding their dogs, and coming to the conclusion that a commercial diet is by far from the best choice, and in fact raw, natural foods are the best choice for dog nutrition.For those curious about getting started in changing their dogs' diets, I would recommend Kymythy Schultze's ""Ultimate Nutrition"" and Carina MacDonald's ""Raw Dog Food"" before recommending Billinghurst's ""GYDAB"".But I would buy this little book too, as it's surely the ""Grand Daddy of them all."""
3,Redundant...,"After reading many websites on the BARf diet, I was rather disappointed in this book. Our dog trainer recommended it so I purchased it(rather expensive). The author repeats over and over what could have been said in a few chapters. Commercial dog food is bad and bones are good pretty much sums it up. It would have been nice to have an index to look up specifics, like the actual diet.If you do a search on the BARf diet on the web you'll get precise, comprehensive information for no cost!"
4,How we do it when we do it shawty U-WAY!!!!!,"I fell in love with ""85 ft. Big Boi"" when I first heard it. The chorus goes like this: ""I know you waitin for daddy, it won't be long shawty, be patient cause I'm comin to you, ridin dirty on 85, slow taking it easy I don't want nothing to keep me from you."" Also, U-Way was a song that was played alot in the clubs. Alot of people didn't know this is the same group that sings ""Damn!"" If you get the new album Drankin Patnaz, then you get a bonus DVD with all of their videos on it."
4,BEST DOWN SOUTH ALBUM EVER!,"THE YOUNGBLOODZ ARE THE BEST SINCE NOLMT.THEY HAVE A STYLE LIKE A CHITOWN GROUP.THEY BRING A URBAN FLAVA TO THE BURBS THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.HERE'S ALL THE GOOD TRACKS 2,4,5,6,7,8,11,14,15."
5,The YOUNGBLOODZ add new flavor for 99' & the yrs. ahead.,"I have a lot of positive things to say about the YOUNGBLOODZ. They are cool down to earth guys and their style of music will keeps you dancing. No matter what kind of mood you are in each different track will fulfil all of your musical needs. I give the album entitled ""Against The Grain"" five stars. If you love Rap music then this is definetly an album for you."
5,Snow Falling On Cedars,"This is an amazing film which I viewed several years ago. It is achingly beautiful in the Cimeatography. The main characters are not perfect but when confronted with the dilemma of prejudice during the post WWII Northwest USA, they act and react, finally with their better selves despite some unfortunate past history. Watch it! I promise, you will not forget it. Trisha"
2,"Breathtaking cinematography, invasive music, 1 hour too long","One of the most beautifully filmed movies in recent years. The beauty of the images is about all there is to recommend here. The manipulative music is far too loud and sappy. Ethan Hawke is a robot. Scott Hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any DVD. Far too long, the only thing keeping your finger from the fast forward button are the images themselves."
3,Artistic but lacks drama,I have to say that his movie was beautiful but it lacked drama. I recommend a similar movie titled Come See the Paradise which focuses more on the plot and drama than the cinematography.
1,Nice cinematography . . . nothing else,"Some nice cinematography is wasted by an inane script full of historical inaccuracies, cliches, and stereotypes. The romance begins to succeed in the first 1/3 of the film, but the attempt to add suspense, tragedy, and mystery all fail miserably, and the actors appear to know it. I wouldn't waste a rental fee to see this tripe again."
2,"Basically ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" With Different Ethnicity","Would have given it a 1-star, but the production values were gorgeous (cinematography, music score, sound, set decoration.) However, very hard to follow with numerous flashbacks in flashbacks (I think.) I didn't read the book so I didn't know the story, but the author seems to have channeled another famous book. All the actors seemed put out to have shown up without any intrest in fleshing out their chracters, no chemistry inter-play with any of the characters. Slowwwwwwww.........."
5,A beautiful film in every way,"I find very few DVDs I would own but I do have this one in my collection. I feel it's one of the most beautiful films ever made. The story is sensitive and delves into the characters' emotions which are evident by simple expressions on their faces. Much of this movie is non-verbal and that is what makes it so intriguing, much like a foreign movie. Ideas are subtle rather than blatant and ""in your face."" The movie assumes its audience is intelligent and able to think a little. I can understand why younger people find the film boring and slow because it's so different from the Hollywood movies being pumped out today."
1,Save Yourself,"I saw this and I must say I felt I was trapped in a sophomoric misunderstanding of Ingmar Bergman. If you want beautiful cinematographic postcards of the Pacific Northwest, by all means. If you want a lifeless P.C. apology to Japanese-Americans, by all means. If you want a movie that you can stay awake through . . . run, run, run to your nearest made-for-televison movie . . .you'll thank me."
5,I love the scenery in this movie and the music,It has such a dramatic soundtrack. My favorite scene was when Young Ishmael and young Hatsue were picking strawberries in the field and then running through that forest. I was a great visual and the music there was so compelling!!! It makes me wish I had a young love when I was younger!!!Very very romantic~
3,"Worth seeing, not buying","It is encouraging that in a growing number of ways, Americans are looking back and doing some self-criticism on issues like social and racial discrimination. The plot blends romance, history and mystery but in the end it is human nature and love that prevails. The movie keeps the viewer's interest throughout, but is not a keeper DVD.Plus: Very good cinematography and use of camera; good acting; strong references to the historical tension of Jap-American relationships.Cons: Constantly dark scenes, which may be atmospheric, but tiring; A bit slow at times."
2,Lost in the dark cedars,I found this movie to be rather interesting but the fact that almost the whole movie was so dark ruined it for me.This is a problem in a great many movies and can't understand why.
2,nibbling on kelp,"Snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet, dismal, cold and foggy weather of the region. Utterly depressing.The plot is plodding and stale. No surprises.None of the characters can one identify or sympathise with. That every group is bigoted is nothing new.The ending not worth waiting for.Scenery is lovely as usual but the only redeeming feature of this film is that it portrays the region as it was that began dying out as I was born. The lumber industry and fishing are no longer what they once were. The ferry boats and strawberry fields are still there but tourism is now the biggy."
2,dont buy,well i didnt watch all this movie but i did watch about an hour or so of it. from what i saw it was quite boring. but it picked up a bit but then towards the end it got boring again and i quit watching it.
2,A True Stinker,"Cinematography is just ONE ingredient of a good film, not thewhole recipe. This was a story with so much promise, yet it insistedon becoming eye-candy rather than a good movie...... END"
1,Crosses line to propaganda.,"Ostensibly sympathetic to Japanese Americans, Snow Falling On Cedars actually crosses the line to propaganda by failing to acknowledge that there is another side of the story. The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is barely mentioned, the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians that led to the unjust internment of Japanese Americans omitted. But the film goes even furher, referring to the camps as ""concentration camps,"" which they were not; this is a deliberately misleading lie. These omissions and false impressions can only stir up bad memories and provoke renewed hatred. My father defended the U.S.A. and the rest of the world from the Japanese during World War II, watched many of his friends slaughtered, and would turn over in his grave if he were aware of this atrocious, simple-minded, one-sided film."
3,Okay product but overpriced and not what I expected,"Just to make sure you are clear of what you are getting here this is a piece of cardboard with a nic epicture on the front of it and little cutouts that open to reveal a picture of a toy or christmas ornament. There is no little gift or candy behind the windows. It seems a bit expensive for what it is. Also I am having trouble with opening the individual windows and not popping a neighboring window open at the same time.Oh well, next year I will buy one from a local store that I know what I am getting but will do it before December as they were all sold out locally."
4,Yumilicious!,"These snax are fantastic ! Full-size berries, and lots of them. A bit sweet for breakfast, but make a great snack. Unfortunately we could not enjoy the whole case, my dog found it and ate about 8 of the pouches !"
4,Good Book,"When I purchased this book I was looking for something a bit more informative. While it does give basic information for several herbs, it does not however give the herbalist sufficient information to utilize it as a primary resource."
4,"Celica 2002 GTS, no body kit","This fits pretty well, and doesn't stick out off the back very much at all. It does slightly press upwards on my bumper, this could be from a previous accident so I don't want to dock more than one star. Install is a little bit of a pain because of the angle to get the original brackets off, but I did it on my own in a parking lot. I use it to be able to take bikes with me, and still have some space for people/other stuff. I used this bike rack:Allen Deluxe 3-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (1.25 or 2-Inch Receiver)"
1,NOT a Tango movie to buy!,"As far as tango is concerned, this is NOT a movie to buy based on the word Tango in the title. As for the movie itself, we'll let's just say that it is not worth purchasing let alone the time wasted by watching this film. I am a fan of Argentine Tango, and this movie does not have any worthy tango scenes."
5,enlightening,Stephen Brookfield delivers a broad perspective on critical theory and its application to adult education. He really makes you think and reflect on your teaching. Excellent resource.
5,Good,"I was very happy to get this skin cream because they don't make it where I live anymore and I wanted to give it to my Mom for her birthday. It arrived a little late, but it was ok."
5,Great for students,"I read this book for a grad class in survey research methods. It's easy to read, if a little dry. Most of the example surveys come from Dillman's work, and a greater mix of the topics of the example surveys would be nice. I would definitely recommend it to students and professors who are teaching classes in this topic."
4,Great sourcebook but update was not complete,"Overall a great book, but if an author is going to create a new edition, I think greater care is needed when updating sections. One small example is that the price of postage stamps (when discussing mail surveys) is still listed as 32 cents. Little things, but if I'm going to pay for an updated book, I expect all of the book to be updated to reflect the current state of affairs."
5,There will never be one better...,"Sir David is his usual charming self in this beautifully made documentary. I can't see there ever being a better video series about birds, this truly is the penultimate expression of Attenborough's love of nature. The cinematography is top-notch and there are no boring segments to be found. If you are at all interested in birds, whether casually or professionally, you owe it to yourself to watch these videos."
5,I love birds anyway,but the footage in this video exceeds even David Attenborough's awesome standards! Just watched it for the 4th time so far. Wow!
5,SWEET DEAL CONTAINING LIFE OF BIRDS,"If you guys are like me, you will love this. You can get Planet Earth, Life of Mammal, Life of Birds and Blue planet for a serious discount!!!Check out this link below or search ""The BBC Natural History Collection""http://www.amazon.com/Natural-History-Collection-featuring-Planet/dp/B001957A44/ref=sr_1_sc_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1327543257&sr;=8-2-spellSuch a great deal for such a great series of shows!!!!"
3,"Great series, poor quality DVD's","I really love this series but am disappointed in the DVD set. The picture quality is mediocre at best and doesn't show the great photography which made the original programs so appealing. The discs were very difficult to remove from the case, and you have to be careful not to damage them when taking them out. One of the hubs which held the DVD's in place broke off after the set was played only a few times. I wonder why a better DVD set of this series wasn't made for our region. This is not an expensive set if you can get it at a reduced price, but one wonders if it is really worth the money when other nature documentaries which are just as good have been released on better material. If you like David Attenborough and want to see one of his best documentaries featuring birds you will want to own this set, but you might be very disappointed in its quality."
3,"Good but, videophilies on a budget beware","I was a little disappointed with the quality of video on a few shots. However, any video with David Attenborough is worth the investment, his intrigued and enlightened tone elevates the documentaries beyond downfalls in video quality. For those that love birds, or like being intrigued by the exotic stories of nature this series is a must. If your a collector of Attenborough this is yet another great series. But if you love documentaries because you like hour and hours of stunning photography,this is not at the same quality as other series. Life in the Undergrowth and the Life of Mammals I would recommend if your a discerning videophile. Also beware some upconverting blu-ray players to 120hz and 240hz TVs seem to stutter images from older BBC productions."
5,The Life of Birds.,I am totally fasinated by these DVD's... David Attenborough is amazing!! I dont know how he does what he does... or how he gets the pieces... but the birds are beautiful... and I found all the information about them sooo interesting. This is truly something one could see over and over again....It is so very well done.Linn Blakeney
2,Great program with INFERIOR picture quality,"I love BBC's programs, but the quality of these DVDs is disappointing, and frankly offensive when you consider its high price. Just compare this against PLANET EARTH or BLUE PLANET and you will see what I mean.I suspect the problem may be that this particular set was licensed to Warner Brothers for DVD production, and they obviously didn't put any effort into it. PLANET EARTH and BLUE PLANET, among others, are not. Why they gave this to Warner I do not know. Perhaps they are recording an all-new bird series to replace it.In short, buy this set because it's a good program, but get a good deal."
4,"very realistic, though a bit political","While this video has stunning photography, it also obviously tries to make a point regarding human interference with wild life habitat, and the devastating effects that can have. Some scenes simply were not suitable for my kids to watch (such as birds dying/drowning in oil sludge.) I would have appreciated some sort of warning ahead of time with that regard. While that is a part of life, I think it appropriate to wait until the kids are a bit older (9 or 10 or so) to view it. Otherwise, for teh most part, it was a beautiful video showing many kinds of birds."
1,Discs are failed!!,"Be careful when you order this item. Some discs are failed, as the ones I bought. The problem: Image freezes every few seconds, which makes the documentary impossible to watch. This is very frustrating. I understand that -under Amazon's policy- you cannot return CDs once you open them. Buy the CDS rather from a physical store, where you can actually return any failed merchandise."
5,An amazing video,My husband and I found ourselves drawn into the sights and sounds of the Life of Birds each week. Our only regret was we did not catch all the episodes so we bought the tapes as a gift for our parents which we intend to borrow! The photography is top notch and the information reveals a side of our feathered friends we never appreciated before. You will never look at birds the same way again!
5,Delighted to receive this double edition!,"I was thrilled, as a 'newly fledged' Agatha Christie fan, to find this excellent double volume of Miss Marple's first and last cases. It was in very good condition, a little yellowed with age, but the binding and all was in great shape. A proud addition to my library! It came promptly and properly packaged. A real treasure!"
3,Mix of new Swing and Electric Rock,"If you're a fan of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies for their swing stylings, you may be disappointed by this one. It's about half swing and half electric rock that I didn't find anywhere near as enjoyable, even as rock."
5,Ferociously Stoned kicks all kindsa ass!!!,This CD is CPD's most original album in my opinion. They are able to put good ska (which I usually hate) and swing together to make a truly awesome blend of music. The Lifeboat Mutiny is probably my favorite song of all time. - JeePhunk@aol.com
5,"CPDs best CD, but it ain't swing","Ok, if you are a new fan you probably think that CPD is only swing, but if you want swing stick to Zoot Suit Riot and don't compare it to this album because they're completely different. In fact, if you are into only swing don't even bother with CPDs other albums. THIS ALBUM IS NOT A SWING ALBUM! Yes it has a few swing songs but you can find them on Zoot Suit Riot. I just love this CD, even though I became a fan through Zoot Suit Riot. Almost the whole album kicks ass, and the different styles of each song keep you on your toes and keep you dancing; even laughing at times. Please, just don't expect this to be the same as Zoot Suit Riot because it's not. If you are open to other types of music, just give this a shot at you might end up liking it. In fact, I disliked most of this album at first because I was expecting swing; once I gave it a chance and opened up to something different I could not stop listening to it."
5,Kewl beyond belief!!,"Now I grew up listening to The Stray cats, Faster pussycat, ELO, The Dead Milkmen and Velvet Underground (among others); I love swing and Ska and this album rules!""Dirty Mutha Fuzz"" is funky and funny, ""Teenage brain surgeon"" is classic punk as well as ""Master and slave"" and ""Answering machine"". ""Drunk daddy"" shows the swing direction that the band was growing into. This is real good stuff, call it Swing or Ska or Punk...loud, brash riffs and colorful horns coupled with a lead singer with the voice mannerisms of Mike Patton. If you like music with complex tones and textures and are sick and tired of the commercial machine sound, you will REALLY like this album!"
1,Not What You Think,It's little more like for throwing on the back of your seat to sit on rather then to curl up in. It barley works. It takes forever for it to heat up. I'm not really happy about this because I could have got a bigger one for cheaper at my local store and a better quality.
1,Would not recommend the wide angle lens,"I have a Canon G9 and I would not recommend the wide angle lens in this kit since the corners of the photos are cropped. The cropping can be eliminated by zooming in, but to the point that the viewport is the about the same as the stock lens, thereby making the wide angle lens useless. I've found other reviews (after my purchase) claiming that the Canon wide angle lens does not have this problem.I called 47th Street Photo to send this back and they are going to charge a 15% restocking fee for a product that I feel is defective."
1,Universal does not mean universal,"This item ordered from Amazon is advertised as (Adult Universal)rearm kit, but the CO2 cylinder thread does not fit my SoSpenders PFD and the cylinder can't be returned!!!!!*@#$"
3,Not What I thought,Did not make it change like I thought and was told. But I have since got a new truck and sold that one so I dont have to worry how it sounds any more
4,Great Fun,"With all the disasters going on today there is certainly a need today as the animator preceived for his time of a rescue operation. The same things, reasonings and corruptions exist at the higher levels and are producing the same expected results. However the characters are well thought out. Great entertainment value and appreciated long after watching this as a youngster."
5,it brings back memories,it brought back memories of when i was growing up.even with the hi tech gadgets.
4,satisfied,"After seeing this same set online for 90 dollars and more, I am glad to have been able to find it at the price I actually did. Thanks for this"
5,Classic must have,"I remember this show from when I was a kid and so wanted to see it again. Now my Wife and I enjoy this series and it really passes the test of time.The stories are well developed as are the characters, the modelmaking is excellent! and it's appropriate for children!"
5,Great,"the set is wonderful , and i love seeing the old series again.. The quality of video is so much better then years ago on an old black and white set.Well worth the money , and more."
1,Word of warning! Aspect ratio shenanigans!,"Just a warning - if this is the same as the English release (and logic would dictate it is), then it has had the top and bottom chopped off to fill widescreen tvs. It was 4:3, so on a widescreen set there should be black space at the sides, or ""pillarboxing"".When will these people learn? Original. Aspect. Ratio!All that said, buy the SD DVDs instead. Thunderbirds is still one of the greatest sci-fi action shows ever! I can wait 'til they get their OAR blu-ray act together. When they do that, I'll buy it in a heartbeat. My dad loved Thunderbirds, I love it, and my boy loves it too. F.A.B.! O.A.R.!I know people will slag me off for writng this before it's out (the British version IS already out and people ARE already upset), but I think it's better that I write this before it's perpetrated on more unsuspecting customers. And besides, everyone thinks my reviews are snobby anyway...Repeat: If they restore the original aspect ratio, I'll buy it in a heartbeat!"
5,Thunderbirds rules!!!,"We love this TV series. Even though it was created (sort of) a long time ago, everyone who sees it wants to watch a second episode! The rescues are exciting and the Thunderbirds are really cool (especially Thunderbird 2).I would give it 100 stars if I could."
5,Thunderbirds are definitely Go!,"For anyone who's ever enjoyed watching the original Thunderbirds when they were young-this set is for you! Even though the special features are quite skimpy-it doesn't matter. This set contains all of the Thunderbirds tv shows (not the 2 movies) from the 1960's and that in itself is wonderful. If you can manage to purchase it at a discount,then that makes it all the more sweet. Five stars. Enjoy!"
5,Thunderbirds!,As a child I was never in control of the TV so sports or soaps would get picked over Thunderbirds. I'd be lucky to catch the opening credits at the most. Years later I watched episodes in fuzzy out of town TV broadcast over the air. So now to have the DVDs is great. Watching these brings back memories of those days long ago. DVDs are well done and looks good up-converted on a HDTV.
4,Will be loved by Albert Brooks and Brendan Frasier fans.,"This movie is a delightful surprise, from Albert Brooks, to Brendan Frasier, to Dianne Wiest's great turn as a psychologist. I was laughing out loud by myself, always a sign of a great movie to me."
3,The Scout,The scout was funny! I think at times there were moments that seem stupid. I guess that's what making movie's all about! I think you might enjoy it. It's actully better then I thought it be. That just proves never judge a movie by it's cover :)Enjoy!
2,What Might Have Been,"Roger Ebert said, ""Rarely does a movie start high and go downhill so fast."" The first 30 minutes is wise, witty, amusingly world-weary and wry. The Mickey Mantle/Lou Gehrig scene is priceless. The remainder of the movie is maddening, mediocre, meaningless and maudlin. In addition, the baseball scenes are poorly done. It's a shame because the movie could have been an excellent comedy, but as part satire, part psycho-drama and part Rocky, it fails."
3,A story of a baseball scout,"The Scout examines the recruitment of baseball talent, with an at times humorous narrative.As a baseball film it doesn't resonate with a particularly engrossing theme, but it is reasonably entertaining, and provides a different take on baseball by utilizing the perspective of a talent scout.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author"
5,"The Scout, by Albert Brooks","Bought as a requested gift for a friend's sister living in Brisbane, Australia (down-under, not the Govenator's homeland). She wanted the movie and it was obscenely expensive in Oz, cheap on Amazon."
1,The worst movie ever made?,Quite possibly the worst movie ever made. It's not funny. The plot is dumb. The acting is bad. Enough said.
3,The War of IndependenceThe War of Independence,The War of Independence was short and with some intereating information. It wonders off from main subject with hard to follow extranious information. Glad I read it but did not get a lot of new information.
5,A Real Algebra Book,"This is one of only a handful of books that actually covers Algebra 1 in detail, and in an order that builds a strong foundation along the way. Sure, there will be students who find this book hard to understand -- they are the ones who are not really ready for algebra and should be either taking pre-algebra or one of the many ""algebra lite"" books that are available. Well-prepared students will find this book a great resource, and should find themselves extremely well-prepared for future classes in mathematics.It is arguably one of the best algebra books available, and is one of the top algebra textbooks as rated by Mathematically Correct, a group that is concerned with the quality of mathematics instruction in California (and beyond)."
4,Why pay more?,"Having my children's textbooks at home has proven invaluable. No worries about forgetting a book at school and not being able to complete homework, not to mention having to lug home 20 pounds of books in the backpack. But I'm also not willing to pay textbook prices so that my child can use a spanking new book for one year. As long as we get the information we need, a few dings and markings are a non issue. I paid $10 total for an otherwise $90 new book. Great service!"
4,Algebra: Structure and Method Book 1 (California Edition),"No marks that I have found yet. All pages seem to be there. Cover is good. In fact, it hardly looks used."
1,"If this is good, then I hate to see what is bad","This book is a poster child for the classic gibberish math book, replete with cloudy phrasing and examples that match the problems maybe 2/3 of the time, and fail you when you really need guidance. Very little plain English, but instead lots of conclusory assertions paired with rattling off of terms that might make the Math Club all giddy, but that leave you scratching your head at what the heck they just told you. Only when you do a few problems do you realize, oh, [point that could have been made much more clearly], is what they were saying! Truly, a horrible book, one that has inspired me to volunteer for my school district's textbook selection committee. One comment above made a particularly excellent point: this book tackles factoring relatively early. Factoring starts off easy, but the water gets deep quickly. This book is an anvil, not a life jacket."
2,Too few examples,"There are too few examples in this book. And the examples that are present are for the easiest problems only. Each section's problems are divied up into A (easiest), B (harder), and C (hardest). That's fine, but they give examples and explanations for A-level problems only."
1,Out dated,"I purchased this book because a student is using it in his parochial school. The young teacher seems to be trying to teach with the instruments and style with which he was taught. I see much better recently updated textbooks. This reminded me of why students have questioned ""why do I have to learn this stuff anyway."" There is too much early emphasis on linguistic models and computationally trickery which actually suits later concepts. Other books I use have a more modern focus on functions and applications."
2,Not very great,"I have always been a great student in math. Yet, when I got this book I couldn't understand any of it. They don't show how to do the problems step-by-step. If I missed one day of school, I'd be lost and up to midnight trying to figure out the lesson. Overall, this book just confused me. It's very well organized, and shows some examples. Yet, the examples don't quite help you wiht the problem you're having a hard time with."
2,Hard to Understand,"When I recieved this book from my school, I thought it would explain everything step by step. But to my conclusion, I barely understood it. When the textbook does'nt explain things good, how is the student supposed to understand it? I do not reccomend this book. But I do recccomend Algebra 1 Concepts and Skills."
3,Not a bad bet,"The camera body is very good. The lense looks properly aligned as well. However, I noticed anistropic chromatic aberrations prominent esp at the edges. Thus unless your subject is right in middle of your view, you might see aberrations on sharp edges. However the product is very good and for a amateur its recommended."
4,Very good for the price,"I'm happy with these bino's. They are a bit big but they have better eye relief than my brothers 2 1/2 the price monarchs 10x42's and I need that because I wear glasses and the field of view is very good. The single eye right side diopter adjustment is harder than it should be and thats why I'm not giving it five stars. Nikon said you should only need to adjust this once and leave it alone but I've been hunting for over 40 years and used many a bino and when you are looking at distances that vary from 50 to 1000 yds. plus, you need to fine tune the focus from time to time. With the diopter ring being as difficult to turn as it is it can be a bit of a pain. I'm still very happy with them and would recommend them to anyone, especially for the price."
4,Excellent,Wonderful clear view and light for the size. Only wish the lens caps were attachable to each other as well as the binoculars as they will eventually get lost. Also wish the loops for the neck strap were larger as they do not fit the chest harness I use and make hiking with binoculars and cameras Much easier!
2,disapointment,"I purchased these binoculars from Amazon based on the Nikon name and customer reviews. I suppose my expectations were too high. The optics were respectable, with well lit imagery. The disappointing part was the made in China construction, they felt cheep. They were bulky and heavy and the focus adjuster felt crappy. I returned them, and purchased the Bushnell Legends, they are constructed in China as well, but they are very nice for the money. The glasses feel great and work exceptionally well, plus they come with a great case and extra goodies. The truly amazing part is you can get such incredible binoculars these days for such a little amount of money, doesn't seem realistic. No candy coating, just callin it as I see it."
3,Too Long!,"Starts off with great battles, drama, everything you could want! But after a while, you just want it to end. Interesting enough to rent.....only to rent."
3,The Messenger: The Story Of Joan Of Arc,"Sorry folks, but it was too long and drawn out. You need patience to sit through this movie, and the end was a bit of a let-down. Hoffman tried hard but hats off to the leading lady. Cut about 30 minutes off and this could have been a classic..."
2,Disapointing,"This is pretty disapoiting compared to other Luc Besson movies; if you think that the Fifth Element is one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made and if you kept saying ""BIG BADDA BOOM"" for a year, you'll be totally turned off by Nana Vovovich's character."
1,One-dimensional disappointment,"I eagerly awaited this film as I missed the chance to see it in the theatres. I think I could have gone through the rest of my life content with never having seen this abominable film. I spent money that would have been more wisely invested in a lottery ticket!Besson tries to impress grandeur with a heavy hand and overblown performances from his cast. I felt badly that Faye Dunaway had anything to do with this piece of trash. John Malkovich, however, progressively chooses roles not really suited for his style of acting and he sticks out like an English lance in this movie. I don't know if perhaps the director incorrectly informed his actors if they were in a comedy or not, but man, avoid this like the plague! At least you have a choice - the victims of the plague never did."
4,A good movie,"Historical relevance aside, Messenger is a pretty cool movie. If you don't take it as an accurate chronicle of a figure who may or may not have existed several hundred years ago and instead just think of it as the fantastical chronicle of a confused girl, it works very well indeed.The battle scenes were awesome, the humor, if full of colloquialisms, was good but not overdone, and the acting was solid if not great. My biggest complaint is one that I am finding more and more in recent movies. At some points, the beautiful panoramic scenes which work so well on the big screen backfire on TV screens...for example, when Jeanne is running across the fields in the beginning, she is barely visible as a little speck on a big-screen TV.Overall, this was quite an enjoyable movie with some likeable characters, some utterly despicable ones, and shining fight scenes.Recommended."
1,Get me out of her head.,"Visually, this movie is stunning. The performances are good, and it's a technical marvel.However, we spend far too much time in psychoanalysis of Joan. The director is trying to make it clear that Joan's motivations may not have been clear, even to herself, but should it take so long to drive that point home? GET ON WITH IT ALREADY.The humor in this film was oddly placed, and gave a surreal feeling. Whether that was intentional, I don't know - however it further served to detatch me from the subject."
2,Better to rent it... than to buy it if you really want to.,"In comparison to Joan of Arc (1999):Starring: LeeLee Sobieski, Jacqueline BissetDirector: Christian DuguayThis movie doesn't even rate close to it. I give the above one I listed, a FIVE STAR rating. It was made for TV but it is definately worth the purchase. More so than The Messenger."
3,Everytime I Try to Watch This I Fall Asleep,"I've tried, folks. In all sincerity, I have made more than three noble attempts at watching this film in its entirety. Each and every time, without fail, I fall fast asleep. It not only disappoints me that the historical facts have been skewed for no justifiable reason, but it's also tiresome to watch Milla Jovovich play Joan like a heroin junkie. Several inconsistencies abound throughout, from dialects to editing. I think I finally sold this one for some gas money. It only got me around the block."
1,Missed the Boat,This movie is a WASTE of your time money mind and morals.If Mr Besson doesn't believe in GOD and therefore wanted to know why a young peasant girl would take up arms against the British than he would have to deal with FACTS: The part of France Joan was born in was NEVER attacked by the English but by the French Burgundians allied with them; her village was NEVER attacked by anybody and none of her sisters were murdered and raped (according to this flick in that order) so Mr Besson is not trying to figure out Joan but to trot out a sex and sleeze flick.And by the by the Catholic Church burned no body: according to the law at that time they could CONDEMN but they had to have the SECULAR arm do that. Nice if the audience were a little better informed that the makers of this shlock.
2,Quantitative Evaluation,Audio Merits:7/10;Video Merits:9/10;Scenario Merits:3/10;Cinematograhic Merits:5/10;Musical Merits:5/10;Overall Artistic Performance:6/10;DVD Extras:6/10;Recording Total Quality:5/10. Professor's Recommendation:Worst of all Joan of Arc titles. Don't buy it.
5,veridic & beautiful,"Even for us, french people,we know our history, but this masterpiece, is the most interresting, esthetic and intense drama I've ever seen the music are great too ! enjoy"
4,St. Joan of Arc,"I enjoyed this film every much. It moved slow at times. BUt the war sences are very good. Luc Besson doesn't go all out in his usal ways. But the set's, customs, and other things every good. This shows Joan more like a crazy person, but the film was to bring up questons like that. I tought the sound editing was vary good. I wish it was nomatied for a couple awards. But the ""Fifth Element"" didn't get any awards ether. But I think you people should see it. You may or may not like it. But thats good because we are all different. This is a strong Film. Really relazitc and a very eventful war film, probly the frist one since ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Braveheart"". Rent it or buy it.Watch out for misspellings"
4,Refreshing Female Warrior,"I realize that everyone keeps comparing this to Braveheart...why? This is a totally different story. Jovovich did a spectacular job of portraying Joan. She was innocent and pure, yet crazed and wild. It was extremely refreshing to see a woman warrior for a change and she pulled it off amazingly. The movie was a bit dry in spots but honestly the ending was worth the wait. Unlike the opinions of some others...I thought Hoffman was brilliant...finally a portrayal of god with a touch of darkness. He makes you fear him to some subtle extent. I was glad to see God shown in a shade of grey as opposed to the always white and graceful appearance in most films. I believe that this movie raises alot of questions as to how Joan of Arc was deemed a Saint, if this enactment is accuate..and who knows...maybe she wasn't as blessed as believed. I like movies that make you ask questions and think. This movie did that for me."
3,Not a bad effort,"Defintately a good attempt at a movie, with some staggering results, and some not so adequate ones. Milla Jovovich does an ok job as Joan, nothing really moving. The movie mostly concentrates on the battles and very little on story. I don't really know the story well, but what little there was held a small bit of interest. The battles scenes are done extremely well, much reminding me of 'Braveheart'. I love John Malkovich but he didn't have much material to work with. The key was Dustin Hoffman. His screen time in the two and half hour movie is at the most fifteen minutes, and he totally steals every scene he is in. The purpose of his character is great, and he handles it so well. All in all an enjoyable movie."
3,Saint Or Sinner?,"A sweeping epic film. I was impressed by the cinematography. I was fascinated by the psychological twists and questions the film raises. The battle scenes, I must say, are not for the fainthearted. This could have been a great film. What ruined it for me was the performance by Jovovich. I found it overdone and annoying. I was greatly disappointed."
1,Three Hours and Seven Dollars I'll Never Get Back...,"This was the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. I actually warn people in the video store when I see them about to rent it. One guy rented it despite my warning and the next time I ran into him he said he wished he'd listened to me. WHO TOLD MILLA JOVOVICH SHE COULD ACT????????????Awful, awful movie."
4,Braveheart in a dress,"Like Braveheart before it, this film portrays the English as a truly barbaric bunch of pillaging maniacs, which indeed we were before the invention of the cucumber sandwich."
3,Good but not great,"The film was visually beautiful but it felt like it dragged on for too long. What this film added, which I thought was brilliant, was Dustin Hoffman as Joan's conscience or perhaps God if you want to look at it that way. Towards the end Joan questions her actions and we really get taken aback by the fact that Joan, in a way, contradicted herself throughout the film. I thought this was actually fascinating the way her consciense took her back and made her question whether God was the voice she was listening too. It made her more human and actually shed some light onto the fact that perhaps young Joan was a bit crazy. It was a good film but it could have been shorter. I thought Milla Jovavich was wonderful, but John Malkovich as the Dauphin was a bit to subtle--he borderlined parody. Dustin Hoffman was great too."
3,Worth a Rent,"This movie had excellent sets and costume design. The acting is good, the character build up was good for some characters. The fight scenes were almost as good as Braveheart. The script was very modern, with phrases like booty. The film dragged a little at some points and could have used some more trimming. The ending was kind of empty in its simplicity. A lot of the story is based on assumption, so don't expect a history lesson. Worth renting but I personally wouldn't buy it."
3,"Good film, but not great","I missed this movie in the theatres, so I was excited about its video release. I watched the CBS movie about Joan of Arc and felt it left out too many details. The Messenger is the same way. They did use some actual events and some of the recorded dialogue that Joan used, but it seemed that the director used alot of ""artistic license"" too. The actors used alot of modern language and phrases that I don't believe would be used in the 1400s, and then out of nowhere Milla Jovovich would use an actual Joan quote and it would seem out of place. The visual affects were good though and I think Dustin Hoffman was terrific in his role. Overall, Milla was convincing as a wild young woman on a mission. I just wish the writers would have dug a little deeper into the actual history of Joan."
3,Fun...But not historical.,"While the movie proves entertainment if you are looking for a historical movie this isn't it. Joan's talks to G-d and the saints make her seem as if she had a psychological problem, and seveal scenes make her look demonic. While i wouldn't watch this for historical value it is definalitly entertaining."
2,Drives one to read,"Over-acting, silly dialog, and drawn-out camera tricks to convey Joan's ""visions"" make this a tedious and boring adaptation of an otherwise interesting historical tale. The camera tricks are something out ofThe Blair Witch Projector the oldBatmantelevision series and not something one would expect from a movie with a real budget. It is apparent that historical accuracy was a low priority compared to vain attempts to make the story more dramatic through the overemphasized breathy monologues and tilted camera sequences. This is particularly sad in light of the fact that the history behind the story is truly interesting in itself and the Hollywood tricks rob the viewer of any interest in the story at all. The one good thing about this movie is it will make you want to go back to reading instead. And when it does, tryJoan of Arc (Ignatius Press eBook)."
1,Horrible...,Oh my God!It's unbelievable how this movie could gain so much popularity.I think Luc Besson did not know anything about Joan of Arc.And Milla Jovovich shouldn't play this role.She couldn't expressed her (I mean Joan's of Arc) emotions.She was crying and shouting all the time.Nothing more.Besides she was too old to play 17 years old girl.Only one thing in this movie was impressive - batallistc scenes. I am very disappointed with this movie.I guess most of the people who know Joan's biography after watching this movie would feel the same as I do.
1,A reason to revive the Inquistion.,"Where to start criticizing this movie? It fails so miserably on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin.It's obvious from watching this movie that the people who made it either didn't read the historical facts concerning Joan or did read them and simply chose to ignore them.Furthermore, you would never know Joan of Arc was a devout Catholic from seeing this movie. Aside from a few one sentence requests to see a priest, Joan's deep faith and spirituality are totally left out. Not that Milla Jovovich has that kind of range as an actress anyway but couldn't they have at least tried?Other than that I don't know what to say about a movie that seems to go out of its way to demonize a young girl who, by all contemporary accounts, was literally a living saint.It's just a terrible movie. Please don't waste your money."
2,Yawwnnnnnnnnnn,"This movie uhhhh, stunk. Period. Milla Jovovich was so bad I wanted to burn HER not Joan...HER! In fact all the acting from the ""stars"" was horrible including John Malkovich who you'd think would excel in such a role. The fight scenes were so utterly ridiculous...as in: Joan gets shot with the arrow while on the ladder and suddenly the BATTLE STOPS!! INCREDIBLE. The attempts at humorous banter were so bad it actually makes you uncomfortable. About the only redeeming quality of this waste of a movie is the scenic landscapes. And thats the ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars."
1,what a waste!!!,"Waste of time and energy. The main character is an $%#@#$$ing model trying acting and singing (you can't be all, pick one for goodness sake). Her acting abilities are questionable, why? Because I (and many people) have never heard of her. The whole movie is just really badly done. It's too violent for children yet too foolish at times for adults. Especialy a little scene at the begining when Joan is a little girl and she just had that vision with the sword and she comes back home just to see her mother (am not sure if it was her mother or not) killed with that same sword and then raped. The scene is disgusting in that even though it is a bloody and violent scene and the viewer is raging with disgust for the rapist the director decided to make it a ""fun"" scene by portraing the rapist as a fool and clown. Anyway I do not recommend it to any serious watchers of history. VERY BAD"
1,I'd rather see the Swanson version,"THis movie was an insulting depiction of the visions of St. Joan of Arc. Looking through the eyes of a twentieth century thinker...the writer and director decided to throw out the idea of Joan and her divine visions and imply the idea that she was mad. The movie takes the Character of a powerful woman who entered a man's world and controled it with grace and strength...and turns her into a childish mad woman who seem to deserve her fate. NO, if you want to learn the Joan of Arc story then read a book. If you want to see a dramatic version of the story...rent the blackand white, or even better rent the Gloria Swanson silent film"
1,Dissapointing,"Not very offen I throw negative comments on a film, but unfortunately this one doesn't deserve better. I really expected a better job from Luc Besson. While trying to be defiant and innovative, this film falls into historical incongruence. In order to sustain his picture of an eschizofrenic Joan Of Arc, Besson modifies or distorts historical facts and events already proven. For any person who knows and/or respects Joan Of Arc, or is looking to learn more about her, this is the last source they should look into. On another hand, the performances leave to much to desire, starting with Milla Jovovich, who overplays too offen. The only one who stood up to his name was Dustin Hoffman, a good actor in a bad role. To defy the common beliefs and standards in general, be it on Joan Of Arc or on any other subject, is always good, but only as long as such opinions are based on facts, something that Besson forgot in this movie."
2,Luc Besson didn't understand God in this movie,"He has ever had passion to explore some aspects of women, but now he's a ""grown up"". I don't want to see Englishmen, Americans and French themselves playing French in a movie describing history facts, we can not find THE REASON France fought with England when those emotions has been confused a lot. Though I like Milla Jovovich, always. About French's madness, if you are interested in it's beauty and mystery (in this movie, it is expressed little and not so completely), I recommend ""Beatrice"" and ""the ninth gate""(but I've ever seen few French movies). Notice how those people betray God; the ways are funny sometimes and beautiful sometimes, though are cruel (cruelty is based on despair) the same time, of course. I don't know how successful the two movies are, in trying to touch the thought of God, since I myself do not really understand God and find it is hard to understand a little more; at least I am sure they are closer than this one."
1,Don't buy! Unless you are a religious fanatics,"I am a French historian from Canada and I am telling you, the story was more religious non-sense then the real story of Jeanne d'Arc, in the movie the Dolphin future King of France would have to be nuts to believe her! The scenario is bad, monotonous, boring! So unless your name is Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan or if are a priest. Don't buy that ......"

5,Passionate and Inspiring!!!,"Well, i think this one is GREAT! You feel the passion of Joan. . . Any time i need inspiring, i watch this, it's like Braveheart...not without faults, i didn't like toward the end, implying she was inspired by the devil...and SOME like that other Joan movie better, but i think the joan in it was not so good an actor...but then some loved it! i've seen it twice now, to try to see what i missed, but... have seen The Messenger 8 times.Can't say enuf good things about the Messenger, but watch them all and decide for yourself."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,"I didn't like this movie at all... and not just because it was so historically inacurrate. I found the acting to be atrocious.. and when Dustin Hoffman did his big ""vision scene"" at the end all I could think was ""sword in a field.. definitely a sword in a field"" (picture a ""Rainman"" type voice here) the only one who had any talent whatsoever was the little girl playing young Joan.As far as historical accuracy, the only thing that had any semblance to fact was Joan always going to confession. The visions weren't correct, the characters were so poorly conceived they were comical.Bottom line, if you know nothing about Joan of Arc and would like to learn more, don't watch this movie. If you want to see this character portrayed in a realistic manner and very close to what we know about her historically, don't watch this movie. If you have any kind of knowledge of this aspect of french history you will be disappointed. You're better off renting the CBS miniseries."
2,interesting overview of siege warfare-but no Braveheart!,"This movie has 1 redeming quality-it introdues the modernviewer to the art of war, especially the devestation brought aboutduring a siege. I liked the way the movie took you through all the different phases of a battle; the rallying of the troops, the pre-fighting taunting, the use of siege towers, etc.. What amazed me is how much this movie stole from Braveheart. The scenes involving Joan addressing the troops before the charge and the boiling oil falling on the helpless battering ram chargers made me think I put the wrong tape in."
1,Joan ???....,Got to say the video quality was good for a old movie but however I was quite disappointed with the general story line.... a resonable cast but story line was too week ... nothing much but a crazy women going to war.......sad story not a blue ray worth keeping wont be watching it again ......a pity....
2,Painfully Inaccurate,"This movie is so painfully inaccurate, one could assume it was written by someone who not only has no notion of who Joan of Arc was historically, but also has no reverence for her as a saint. Joan of Arc had two brothers, not a sister. Domremy was not attacked by the Burgundians or the English, as it was already English territory. Joan heard the voices of Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and Saint Michael. Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret were the dominant voices. She also spoke of the voices comforting her, not terrorizing her for following their direction. I despise this representation of Joan as a broken, pathetic, and incredibly insane antihero. Anyone who has given the time and thought to reading her trial transcripts would know that she was so much more than this film could possibly pretend to portray."
2,INVESTS EVERYTHING BUT STILL COMES UP SHORT,"Milla Jovovich as Joan of Arc. No. I don't think so. She tries, she really does. She invests her all into this role, and sometimes she does very well. But does she inspire legions of men to defend her and to defend France? Does she convey the kind of passion and compassion that could inspire so many men to believe in her? I think Jovovich errs too much in that she plays the role a little too far down the ""insanity"" line. This is a debate for some... was Joan of Arc a holy, saintly woman who really heard voices or was she simply insane? Who will ever know for sure? In this portrayal though Jovovich overacts and instead of conveying the passion of someone for whom her religion is sacred she conveys insanity. The story of Joan of Arc has been done better and more convincingly, and this film, while visually stunning, does not compare to earlier versions. Nice try."
1,Wrong Message,"What a waste of resources...This biopic is completely by-the-book, telling the story in an academic, uninspired, predictable way. The characters are all cardboard, and lead Milla Jovovich is over-the-top and not credible as Joan of Arc. This movie has no spark or life whatsoever, moving at a snail`s pace and failing to engage. The settings and costumes are decent, but that`s all there is to find here.Director Luc Besson also made the useless ""The Fifth Element"", and the style-over-substance perspective of that movie is present here, too. This is just a bunch of random fight sequences and melodramatic moments that go nowhere and generate a messy cinematic experience. A lackluster movie and one to avoid."
5,People ...chill out!,"This is just in response to several people's reviews (or rants) that the blu-ray version isn't the international version. Had they bought it before complaining? Apparently not... see below. Amazon has listed it (blu-ray) at a run time of 158 minutes. I have the DVD of The Messenger (with a red band at the top of the cover) that says 'International Version' and it's run time is also 158 minutes. Unless, of course, Amazon had erroneously labeled the blu-ray at 158 minutes. But I think not... again, read below.According to a review of the blu-ray release from Hi-Def Digest: ""The disc contains only the 158-minute International Version of the movie which reflects an on-screen title of simply 'Joan of Arc'. The 148-minute American theatrical cut is not included.""So all y'all who complained about THIS release as NOT being the International Release... chill out first and do some research before freaking yourselves and other perspective buyers out."
5,Just some trivia...,"My complete review of this film is on my personal page and elsewhere here (I was one of the first to review it). Most of the other reviews carry all the opinions people have of this movie. Here's just some trivia:This is the second time John Malkovich has played a role in a costume drama previously played by Jose Ferrer. Mr. Ferrer played the Dauphin in ""Joan of Arc"" with Ingrid Bergman, and they both played an older Athos the Musketeer, Malkovich in ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" and Ferrer in ""The 5th Musketeer."""
2,This movie should have been so much more,"I actually give this 2 1/2 stars. After watching Milla Jovovitch in The Fifth Element, I was enchanted. So much facial expression and wonderful potential as a great actress. Her acting doesn't disappoint in this film either. The others in the cast are in top form also; John Malkovitch, Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway all give wonderful performances. The photography is stunning, the battles are exhilarating. And yet the movie falls short because of the poor presentation. There was no real connection, flow, or even story line between the battle sequences and her dream sequences. The editing fell short in tying the remarkable individual elements into one sensible theme. As another reviewer mentioned, it would have been better if this movie had less going for it from the start, such as the superb acting and extraordinary visuals. By the time we get toward the end of the movie when her conscious appears, I just wanted the movie to end."
5,A couple mistakes...,"I wish to correct two spelling errors in my review which may have been caused by my lack of knowledge of the French language. France's Marshall's name is Gilles de Rais (not de Rey), and Charles' loyal but curse-spewing captain is La Hire (not Laer). This may seem a small error, but I am quite particular about my writing, and I am compelled to acknowledge and correct such mistakes. Thank you for your time."
2,Braveheart with breasts,This film is quite confusing. The possibility of Jeanne being a prophet is imposibble a) she cant perform any tricks and b) cant predict the future. She is a girl who is very eager to go into war with english most likely for revenge. She claims that god talks to her and tells her what to do. 2 and a half hours the film is long and quite boring near the end you cant decide whether its god or the devil Jeanne is consulting with. Oh and she goes into war Braveheart style gets badly injured but is still eager to go back and fight. I can give you one reason to watch this film Mila Jovovich thats about it.
3,Merely entertaining,"The movie is ente However, a movie based upon a real person'slife should be more than just entertaining; it should be instructionaland inspirational. Due to it's apparent historical errors, it is neither educational nor inspiring. It's just another dazzling Hollywood production--lots of glitter, but little substance. It was not a total loss; it piqued my curiousity. I must learn more of this person, Joan of Arc. I've ordered two biographies from Amazon.com and I rented the Leelee Sobieski version of this movie. The Sobieski version is better. Milla Jovovich was good, but Leelee was a much more convincing 18 year old girl."
1,Major FAIL,"I had to stop after 15 min when the gum chewing mediaeval girls started saying ""YO! DUDE! FER SHURE~! DIG IT!being somewhat facetious but thats how it was"
2,More fiction than fact,"Another example of how Hollywood can take a great story and make it painfully drull. The dialogue is laughable (completely comtemporary), the attribution and manifestation of Joan's madness utter nonsense, and it was probably Hoffman's worst perfomance in a movie in well over 20 years. Braveheart it is Not."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen!,"If it wasnt for the fact that I knew that Joan was gonna be burnt at the stake I wouldnt have made it through the movie! Well....thats not true, IOnce I start ANY movie, I cant stop watching till its over. Anyways, the acting in this movie was horrible, Joans character was so un-charismatic that I would have a hrad time believing that an Army of women would follow her to the mall, yet alone an army of men following her into battle!"
1,Why isn't there a 0 stars?,"This is quite possibly one of the worst films ever conceived. Not just made, but conceived. Milla Jovovich can't act her way out of a wet paper bag. I thought The Fifth Element illustrated that. The following people wasted their time and talent on this project: Dustin Hoffman, John Malcovich, Tchéky Karyo, Faye Dunaway. The insane in your face cinematography and the disturbing screaming and gestures of Jovovich's are just awful. Why does Bravo: The Film and Arts Network include this in their 5-Star Cinema series? It's fertilizer."
1,Miscast,"This movie was 100% perfect, except Faye Dunaway should have caked some make-up on and played Joan of Arc herself. She has limitless talents and would have brought the movie what is was missing--a truly spiritual heroine. I'm telling you, Faye Dunaway was born to play this part. One can only hope of a re-make, and soon!"
3,The Messenger is the Message,"After seeing the Messenger only a week after Hallmark's Joan of Arc, I think it's a testimony to the real life enigma that she could be interpreted in such very different ways- from a girl of incredible strength and courage ready to die for her faith to a woman made neurotic by circumstance and visions fueled by her faith in God despite all she had seen. Leelee vs. Milla? I think both women simply found a part of Joan they identified with and ran with it, though I must say, I enjoyed Leelee's portrayal more. It was hard to watch the end though with the conscience (Dustin Hoffman) but when you are called by God to do something it often doesn't make sense- even to you and you are tormented with whether it is really God or your ego. And yet, you must keep these fears silent to accomplish the goal. In that, I think ""Messenger"" hits both its mark and the heart of Joan of Arc in this beautifully sylistic if gritty epic."
4,"Imperfect, but compelling and kinetic","Visually dazzling and hypnotically exciting, the Messenger is a movie that never fails to entertain. Staying true to Besson's flamboyant film style, the movie begins so well, that it grabs you and doesn't let go. Its too badit doesn't completely hold out to the end, but Jovovich's wild-eyed performance more than makes up for that fault. Historic film making at its finest."
1,"Shame on you, Luc!","8 out of 10 for technos; 3 out of 10 for drama; 1 out of 10 for history. Besson's Joan is a raving vengeful femme and bears no resemblance to the real Joan of Arc, so well documented by dozens of scholars. Don't for one minute be fooled by his revisionist Joan; the real woman was a real star and a saint. I was left with a feeling of anger, as if a fraud had been perpetrated, because Besson's Joan simply cannot have achieved the heroism that the real Joan so patently did. Her trial and life are among the most well-documented of any historical figure, and Besson's Joan disavows or ignores what the best scholarship has long established. A modernist gothic horror it might be, but it's cheap cinema (because this Joan is just not credible) and even cheaper fiction. Don't infect your children with this a-history."
4,Religion and war go hand-in-hand.,"I like the action in this movie and all the cast. Too bad things have not changed, just better weapons & more Religion. Blu-ray is the best way to own any movie, best picture and sound."
4,Will the real Joan of Arc stand up?,"Let's forget about historical truth. OK, people did not go to a private confessional box in the 15th century as portrayed. The map of France did not look as we are shown in the movie's introduction. Military technology had not then invented all the siege devices shown on screen. And nobody but nobody actually understands what made Joan tick. You take your pick from saint to tomboy and from heroine to crazy. But Milla gives a convincing portrayal of a gifted teenager who was used and finally betrayed by the man (the Dauphin) she tried to help. It's a great story, marred only by some silly sequences. The French apparently tried to force open the gates of Paris with three locksmiths and two men on a ladder! Come on now. By contrast, the battle scenes at the siege of Orleans are magnificent. Vive La France."
1,Unwatchable Travesty,"For the easily pleased, simple-minded, less discriminating viewers only. John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman couldn't even save this one. I even think their characters dragged this story down, but there was so little hope and promise from the moment this movie was conceived. Mila what's her name was so thoroughly annoying and unconvincing throughout this mess I just wanted to fast forward to the end to see her burn. At least it has a happy ending. The best thing I can say about this movie is it took pathetic and lame to new heights."
2,well.....it was okay,"i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have ""joan of arc"" the savior of the republic of france, to make her into a total lunatic? i know she had a minor case of epilepsy but she's not no EMILY ROSE. (in case you dont know emily rose she was a girl who was a epileptic that was so intence she was supposely possessed by demons.) how can u do such a thing? they made joan so annoying i didnt want to watch it no more. the action was not good at all. u could tell some of the cast of the movie were atheists because they made it look like those signs were not real. those signs were left by GOD and they were not by coincedence. dont bother pick it up and if you do, i doubt u will watch it again. this is the miami reviewer. PEACE."
1,Horrible Movie,"I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a movie. This was historically inaccurate beyond belief. It almost seemed like it was making Joan out to be the villain. If you want to see a good movie on Joan Of Arc, see the ""Joan Of Arc"" movie that was on TV."
2,Is Jeanne a Heroine or Not?,"Is the director French? Is Joan not a French heroine? If the answer is yes to both questions, then I have a hard time understanding why Besson makes her ""confess"" that all her great deeds were a mistake. It doesn't bother me to interpret Joan of Arc as a lunatic - for all I know she may have been schizophrenic indeed! (What else makes you hear voices?) What I don't like is the notion that Joan herself lost faith in her own cause, questioned her own motives and regretted what she did, as apparently Besson makes her do at the end. That's not my idea of a heroine or hero."
3,Horrible voice to soundtrack balance,"I assume the dvd that ... is selling is the same one available in rental stores. If it is I must say the movie is extremely difficult to hear. Most of the time the dialogue is extremely quiet or not even evident. If there is dialogue present then the soundtrack is recorded so strongly and loudly over it that you don't hear it. Plus, if you have a dvd player with dynamic sound which evens things out you will NEVER hear the dialogue unless you turn it off due to the poor overpowering imposition of the soundtrack over the dialogue. The neurotic bit with Joan grows tiresome as well. It is very nice though in it's way of gloriously demonstrating midevil warfare :)))"
4,Very good portrail of inner struggle,I like this move very much. I think that war should be shown as the brutal thing that it is and not made to look pretty or glamorous. But I especially enjoyed the scenes with Dustin Hoffman. I thought it was a pretty good depiction of the inner struggle that a spiritual person can go through.
4,History in action...,"If looked from a historical point of view, the movie has little to offer. But if you want to see some Middle Ages action flick, it's almost as good as it can get thanks to incredible battle scenes. As one reviewer noted before, it's on par with those seen in Braveheart. Movie is a bit too long and sometimes I though they should have skipped some parts, esspecially after Joan was taken prisoner. Overall, a decent action movie on a historical theme that is fun to watch. But if the history is what you are looking for, my best advise is to look somewhere else."
3,Non Historical Joan of Arc,"Having done extensive research and study into Joan of Arc, this film is loaded with historical flaws. It appears to be the Director's personal fantasy of Joan. He portrays her as ""wacked out"" or a ""mental case"". He introduces a murder/rape which never happened as a motivator for Joan. He also plays ""Hollywood"" with many other non-facts. They could have produced a film, following the actual facts, which would have amazed audiences.I have it as a part of my collection to use for comparisons. If you just watch it for visuals and entertainment, it is fine."
1,The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,"Well as a student of History, this movie is to say the least, pittiful. The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable. The young women who plays Joan, should go back to acting school, she only seems to have two levels crazy, and crazy screaming. The only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes."
4,Very entertaining,My daughter loves the sesame street characters and they are really educational. She has learnt her ABCs from Sesame Street.
5,kids love it!,another must have if ur kids love Sesame Street! I would like to see more of these soon!
5,Small Size=greater versatility,"This unit's small size makes it possible to mount in any vehicle. Every car at my house has a spot where it could be mounted (but it stays in my truck!). This radio works just as good as the more expensive ones, as long as your antenna is of high quality and tuned. I highly recomend this radio to people who are looking for a basic radio that won't break the bank, and for the CB'ers who just want to communcate to other drivers without having to mess with RF gain, delta tune, dyamic boost, etc."
5,Yes it is album of the year,"Yes it is album of the year - voted by DJ Ravin at Buddah BarIt took me nearly a year to get at copy of Bliss.They are already a big compilation hit especially ""Kissing""For me Sleep Will Come, Don't look back, Kissing are my favorite.But it's hard to find an album today were every track are sostrong as the tracks are here, listen to song for Olabi its a lovely journey with only percussion and chords - love it, also used in C.S.I (Crime serie).a blissful fan"
5,A whole new world,"I found Quiet Letters in Paris, and listened to it on a summer trip in Europe. It somehow has a wondeful mix of beats, textures and voice. I'd never heard anything like it and it's led me into the world of ambient and chilled music. I can't wait for their next release. It is of a whole and I don't think single tracks should be isolated...Right now it is the soundtrack to my life and I hope you'll enjoy it too."
5,Simply A Masterpiece,"This album is on track to be one of my Top 3 of 2004. It is a masterpiece from beginning end. It is the perfect soundtrack for a drive through the country at sunset, or at home with candles flickering and wine. It is lush, mult-layered, and truly gorgeous. It is VERY hard to find however, and if you come across it - definitely snap it up. I would absolutely give this disc as a gift to others with an appreciation for music of emotion and depth."
5,A Good Radio...,"I recently bought and installed this radio in my truck, and I have not had any problems yet!!! A few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive (sometimes when it is on I do not receive any traffic) but that is about it. I enjoy Cobra products, this is my second radio (I just traded up from a 25NWXT), I have a Cobra HG2000 Antenna, and I am waiting on a Cobra Mic for my radio. So far no problems with any of it and I hope to have none down the road!!!!!"
1,Poor Service and Follow Through,"Can you give less than one star?After ordering the hat, I got an email from Star Struck stating that they were ""sold out"" and made an error.They continued, ""If you find it in your heart to forgive this blunder and allow us another chance to delight you, we would like to extend the coupon below in appreciation of your loyalty and trust... ""The funny thing is that the coupon code they gave me for a whopping 10% off EXPIRED 2 months ago. Also, the hat I ordered was $17 and the minimum price to use the coupon code was $25. Yeah, they ""delighted me."""
3,For poly-sci majors only,"Scholarly to the extreme, this book assumes knowledge of political theory and of the Solidarity Movement. I had little of the former, none of the latter, and as a result the book did not make the impression on me it may have otherwise. I got the feeling that had I had the neccesary background the book would have been very thought-provoking and interesting."
5,Arturo in his younger years,"While strugling in Cuba, and before his move to the US, Arturo seemed to be more passionate with his trumpet. This album shows his capabilities and, although not the wildest efforts, demonstrates the reason he is among the top ever trumpeters. DC"
2,"Derivative, unimaginative, uninspired","Arturo obviously is familiar and comfortable with the classics which he covers, but he doesn't do anything particularly interesting with them, and is usually downright boring. The modern effects are out-of-place and crude. Sure he can play his instrument, but he doesn't have the soul or mastery-without-effort of his superiors."
1,PRETTY MUCH OF A YAWNER!!!!,"I made it about half way through it.It reminded me of a dog chasing itsown tail,,,,,,and never catching it.The book was interesting for about 100pages, then, it all started to sound the same.And the cast of characters????? Who could keep trackof them all!!!!"
5,FAITH,"FAITH HILL SHE TURNED ME ON TO COUNTRY...A VERY FINE CD THERES JUST SOMETHING ABOUT FAITH,HER MUSIC ANYTHING BY HER IS A NO BRAINER GET IT....."
2,An OK Weighted CD,"This is what I call a weighted CD... in this case, the beginning. I love the first 3 songs on the CD, and I hate the last 9. When I listen to it, I just listen to the first 3 songs then stop it. Kinda' dissapointing... at first I was thinking that all the songs would be like the first 3, but then I was sorely disappointed. But again, it DID have 3 good songs!"
1,"COUNTRY ""AIN'T LIKE THAT""","Excuse me, but I don't think that ""Hank done it this way""!!!! This album has way too many POP tunes on it! What's wrong with COUNTRY is that people like Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, JoDee Messina, and Faith are taking the country out of country music!!!!!! I don't think that Reba McEntire (God bless her soul) would ever have been dumb enought to release a COOKIE-CUTTER song like ""THIS KISS""!!!!!! I won't say that every song is disgusting. Hell, I actually like ""LET ME LET GO""!!!! But, people, IT'S NOT A COUNTRY SONG!!!!! WE DON'T NEED 'DVIA'S' IN COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!! PLEASE, STOP BUYING TRASH!!!! IF YOU WANT A COUNTRY ALBUM, PICK UP STEVE WARINER or 'KING' GEORGE STRAIT!!!!!!!! I think that Faith should hang up her invisible Stetson, and stop bringing her new POP-DVIA sound into Tim McGraw's music!!!!"
5,Her best cd yet,"I LOVE THIS CD! It has all sorts of songs on it. ""I Love You"" a 5 minutes+ song, is one of the best despite its length. These songs are perfect for her. Although much of the cd is taken up by Faith going ""Oh ho"" and ""wo wo"", I think shes a better singer than her husband (no offense Tim)."
1,This is a one hit CD.,"Very disappointed in this CD. Only one good song (""This Kiss""). Her voice is weak and doesn't have any range. On some of the songs she sounds like she's not even singing in the right key. For REALLY great singers I'll stay with Wynonna, and Shania. What a difference - to listen to one of them after listing to Faith."
2,What happened?,"After releasing one of my favorite Country albums, ""It Matters To Me,"" ""Faith"" went in the wrong direction. The songs are completely droned out by assembly-line like production. I some songs on the album, like This Kiss, Love Ain't Like That, Let Me Let Go, Me, and My Wild Frontier, but even they fall victim. The album is pieced together, also - for example, the guitar rhythm to Let Me Let Go sounds manufactured and not in continuity with the other songs. I've never liked the song The Secret Of Life, both on this album and the version by Gretchen Peters. ""Somebody Stand By Me"" is too bombastic. Often, Faith's voice sounds more strained on this album than on her others. Hopefully, Faith Hill will do better again next time."
5,I think this is a great cd!! Every country fan should get it,Hill has done a great job. This is more mature from her last one.End
3,Okay,I liked this Cd but I think her previous work was better I really liked Take me as I am and It matters to me.The only song I really liked was this kiss.
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"Considering Faith Hill's reputation, I made this CD my first purchase of her music. This Kiss is of course terrific, and Better Days is another of my favorites, but the rest of the songs seem like background noise compared to those two. I don't think the selection is varied enough and whenever I listen to this CD, I can't tell the songs apart. I wish that I could say the duet with Tim McGraw is good, but I usually press the skip button when it comes on. It's unoriginal and boring to listen to, although I like him as a solo artist. This album was inconsistent and a big disappointment."
4,this cd is good in my opinion.,"it is good especially the number four song ""it ain't like that"" is the title."
4,Best CD yet!,"I have listened a million times and I just think it gets better each time. I highly recomend it, even if you don't like country music. She has a style all her own."
5,The best country female singer to date!,"This is my first Faith Hill CD, but i absolutely love it. I usually program the CD to miss certain tracks, but this CD doesn't have a bad track. Really beautiful stuff. Hope she doesn't keep us waiting too long for the next!"
2,Boo!,"Faith was somewhat a let down for me I epected better. This is not a stink bomb, but it is not masterpice either. I love Faith Hill but I have to be honest. The first cut and This Kiss starts it off and it goes down hill after that with the pretty powerful Just to here you say you love me and et me Let Go to the annoying The Secret of Life and Love Ain't Like That. Faith"
4,Not bad...,"It took me a couple of listen throughs before I really got into this album, but once I did I thouroughly enjoyed it and listen to it all of the time. There's a little of everything and ""The Secret of Life"" is a nice change."
4,SIMPLY A GREAT SONG,"Faith Hill's ""This Kiss"" ROCKS! It's the BEST!!! It has very good and meaningful lyrics. The song makes you want to stand up and sing along with her."
5,I love the cd,I think this is her best album so far. My favorite songs is this kiss and better days. I would suggest buying it. I bought the cd when it hit the stores and never regreted buying it.
4,Have Faith,"Faith Hill is one of the best singers in country music history. This is her best album yet, it is a mix of country and pop, which is my favorite. This Kiss is the best song on the whole CD"
5,terrific!,"this cd is excellent, it has a little of something for everyone. if you're a new faith fan, don't listen to all this junk about her being pop and her music going down hill. she is still the wonderful artist she has always been. I love this album and Breathe equally, they just have different sounds. this album is a joy to listen too and i encourage all faith fans to try it."
5,gotta have faith,"i love faith hill! i bought ""faith"" as soon as it came out and i love it. i went to europe this past summer and, while in barcelona, i found the european version of ""faith"" called ""love will always win."" that one is available on the internet but not the other one that i found in zurich. that one is called ""piece of my heart."" its basically a greatest hits cd from her first 2 cds. i now have 5 of her cds and when ""breathe"" comes out...ill have 6! not too obsessed am i? all of her cds rock! go get them! =)"
3,A ALRIGHT ALBUM,I like this album but I don't love it! I've definitly have heard better. Faith seems like a very sweet person but she isn't the best singer. Her voice sounds like she has over used it. I think she tries to sing notes that she can't do very well with her voice. I bet these songs would sound better if Martina Mcbride was the one singing!
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST....,"This toy is awesome. I play with it with my classmates (5th Grade.) we have wars and fight over it, and it never gets damedged. It is durable an soft too. I LOVE PRICKLES."
2,"Very sturdy, but slips way too much","I had high hopes for this one after reading the reviews. It arrived fast and looked very sturdy and good quality. However, the locking mechanism is as worthless as I have ever seen. No matter how hard you tighten it, it still slides open when you apply any kind of serious ""pulling pressure,"" like pulling the back of your boat against a dock. Not just a little movement, but all the way out until it catches on the plastic insert holding the sections together. It is the most frustrating boat hook I have ever used. I believe the problem with the design is the ribs. While the ribs make it sturdy, they also prevent a tight-sealing lock when you twist it. I think the other positive reviews reflect those who use it lightly and may not need it to lock so securely."
4,"Great book, you msut have it","Well, first Nigel Davies, are a strong british chess player, he won agaist Taimanov.This book joined several articles from a magazine, there are 12 chapter, each chapter has 4 lessons, 48 lessons for all.This is why are two volumes of this Power chess Program.Nigel Davies is one of my best writers, and good chess player. Chessbase launched One DVD with him. He was a Junior British and Rapid British champ.This volume is not for beginer, but are some easy puzzles.In each lessons he gives 6 puzzles the first four are tactic combination, winning material or mate. The last two are positional puzzles, just moves to get better position, or drawback manoeuvres.Nice price, great book."
3,Aspiring Player,"Although the content is there. The book has a dry quality to it that makes it hard to read. The book as a stand alone set of exercises has some attraction because there is a fundamental set of classic motifs and examples broken into individual set of lessons which is valuable. It's just a dry read, but if you take it a bit at a time it has value. FYI The second volume is out for a complete set."
1,Poor Quality and poor Customer Service from CAP,I recently purchased a 300 lb. Olypic set from a local retailer (not Amazon). Several of the plates would not fit the barbell due to excessive cast material. I contacted CAP and sent pictures. After an initial e-mail acknowledging that I had lodged a complaint I have heard nothing further and in the mean time I have several plates I can't use unless I grind the excess myself. My set has a baked on enamel finish and this would require removing the paint. Next time I'll buy YORK.
4,Easy going 70s fun,"Lets set things into perspective, Jaguar Lives is not going to win any oscars or awards for acting. Its not designed for that, its a film designed for Joe Lewis to show off his fighting credentials. Sadly it was filmed at wrong time, during the early 70s around time of Enter the Dragon this film would been a hit. It is what it is good old 70s fun and you be an idiot to get this film if your looking for plot and great acting. Stick to Godfather no this is for martial arts fans and people who like bit of old fisticuffs and old school action from 70s. Its same with Professionals you like it for what it is. I enjoyed this movie and Joe Lewis is similar in style to Mr Bruce Lee just he came at a time when interest in that type movie had wavered a little until the rise of arnie,stallone,chuck,van damme,snipes etc."
4,Nice CD,"Catchy songs, great performance. Simply put a very good CD. I listen to this album quite a bit, and never tire of it."
4,Great Guitar-Pop,"What a nice find. I found a used copy of this in a shop here for a few Pounds. Initially I was drawn to this CD by the cover art. I asked the clerk if I could hear a few songs and he obliged. I was immediately drawn to Round and Round, the vocal harmonies are just great. Next was Half a Heart, a super-catchy guitar-pop song. Finally Mystery Train (of Love), a great Country/Rock song. I find myself playing this CD a lot. I think I will explore some of their other albums. This is a really cool CD."
4,No-frills rock that rocks,"This is a straight-forward album so I will give it a straight-forward review: The music here reminds me of a mix between the Bangles and Creedence, good songs with nice harmonies and catchy guitar parts. I remember when Round and Round was popular in the San Francisco clubs in the 80s.Good album..."
2,"Great music, Bad recording","This session was recorded in Ohio in 1980. I don't know what kind of recording equipment was used, but the sound is terrible!"
2,Fact or fiction,The DVD was entertaining but it gave you the feeling as if Lenin who was such a great figure in Russia has led a very passive life...Lenin was a very weak figure always in exile. I dont know what to believe?
4,You Can't Beat This Polarizer For The Money!,"Using this 49mm polarized filter on my old Magnavox VHS camcorder helped me deliver some excellent looking tapes to the coach this year. Having said this...there are admittedly other much more expensive lenses that will probably perform slightly better. Anyone who films semi-professionally and wants to take a frugal approach to their camcorder purchases would be well advised to not pass this filter up. The variable setting works well enough and interacts with the older camcorder lenses well. Filming from a ""fixed"" booth sometimes means shooting toward the sun a bit. Even if that is not a problem...it still is very effective in cutting down glare from cars and other metallic objects. This filter is the best weapon for these situations at its unbelievably low cost to you!"
4,Hocus Pocus,I first saw this program on cable in the late 90's and really enjoyed it. Got a copy of it on Amazon several years back to show it to my little brother when he started getting into magic.This program does a good job of explaining the principles behind various magic tricks without actually revealing how it is done. So you have to do a little bit of thinking.Hosted by Harry Anderson with appearances by Criss Angel and Lance Burton. Entertaining and informative to watch. Just wished they added some extras on the DVD. Great for fans of magic.
5,Yes......science,Great look at how scientific principles apply to Magic. Fun for both science classes and magicians - a little perspective for both sides.Entertaining and informative
3,not worth the money,"Sadly, the patterns in this book can be found for free on Ravelry or other websites. Save your money and your time."
4,Surprisingly compelling,"This book was recommended by Amazon.com and I threw it in my shopping cart for fun. I found it surprisingly compelling. I do not remember ever reading Hardy before. His writing is wonderful and not at all old-fashioned, in fact, it is a modern book in sensibility. If you like books that care about characters and place, read it!"
4,A fun introduction to Hardy,"This is Hardy's third novel (1873), and is set in the southwest area of England (Cornwall), where he met his first wife. It is the story of young, impetuous Elfride, and her romance with two men: the young architect Stephen Smith and the urbane, educated lawyer, Henry Knight. As common with his other novels, it reflects elements of tragedy, irony, and class advancement. Elfride and Knight are low middle-class persons trying to advance in society and in love. Though not as intricate and challenging as his later novels, it is an entertaining and illuminating read nonetheless."
3,Classic Hardy,"This book probably holds most draw for Hardy fans. Due from time period, from a young author, and from particular style, the book is a jumbled read at points-- but the plot is beyond reproach. Overall, quite entertaining. Did not impress me as much as another Hardy book, Jude the Obscure, but still was by no stretch a disappointment. Very interesting quotes on female nature to be had as an added bonus."
5,Making the complex understandable,Peter was able to give examples which made the complex easier to understand. The edges of the first sections in a copy in the Caltech library were black from use. I was privileged to be a guinea pig for the first edition.
1,Not very easy to read,"Although meant to be an introduction to Relativity, this book is hard to read right from the start. The formalism used throughout the entire book makes it hard for you to gain the courage to try to master Relativity in a technical depth.It lacks a light introduction to the basic concepts of Relativity (without math), to use as the foundation from which to build the rest of the book. Not the best way for someone to start on Relativity..."
3,"Interesting, but....","Truly a fascinting book. Ruthless big business in 1960s Hong Kong, well developed characters with goals and feelings. The author gives a good description on how big business really is in this time and place. My only complaint is that the author spent too much time on the plot involving the KGB and Brian Kwok. The ending was very sad but at the same time triumphant for one of the protagonists of the book, the beautiful Casey Tcholok, a woman who just wants to succeed in a man's world of business. Overall I think the book was longer than it needed to be and deviated a bit from the main plot, so that's why I'm taking off two stars, here..."
3,Left Out Pertinent Info in Description,"Shipment was very fast...received in three days from ordering; however, would not have ordered had the description mentioned it was a Book Club Edition and also that this is only Volume 1...now I have to find Volume 2!"
4,At times challenging but rewarding,"Set in Hong Kong during the 1960's, the plot of Noble House concerns the business and political dealings of all of the most important and wealthy people on the island. Along with Tai-Pan, I would rate this as the best book of Clavell. Although at times he goes into too much detail on some topics, such as finance, this is generally a thrilling book, with some genuinely exciting plot twists. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys long, sweeping epics."
3,detailed and intriguing !!,"A very good novel about Hong Kong. As a native of Hong Kong, it fascinates me.To my knowledge. all the events that took place in this book had happened in Hong Kong or Asia in some ways.I must , however, comment that it is much too long for the layman who is not familiar with Hong Kong or China. This is not a spy novel nor a thriller and I wonder if such a person have the patience or time to go through it. In this day and age of television, this could be a great TV series but such a long and detailed book may not have much appeal. In any case, I must commend James Clavell for producing this book."
1,A stinker,"I like James Clavell. I liked ""King Rat"" very much, and later I enjoyed both ""Shogun"" and ""Tai-Pan"". So why did I find this book so dull, so boring, in fact, that I didn't finish it? The characters are uninteresting, the events trivial, the politics weird. The book's understanding of business and business practice is naive. Really, it could have been ghost-written by Harold Robbins. And the depictions of modern Chinese are not quaint and amusing, as in the distant world of ""Tai-Pan"", but racist."
3,Too many loose ends...,"Clavell's novels have a great way of continuing at the end. Life goes on. But in ""Noble House"" Clavell simply introduces too many segues. The last 200 pages or so of the book seemed rushed, and the book simply ends with too many loose ends. A little frustrating after 1370 pages."
5,excellent clavell: art of war x 100000000000,"welcome to Dirk Struan's Island. welcome to espionage, intrigue, cut-throat ambition, war and love and business, and one big old motherfornicator of an earthquake to top it all off. welcome to the towering rain-soaked skyscrapers and the devil-sea whipped shores of Hong Kong. welcome to a half a week without food, water, or sleep enthralled in this mesmerizing epic from a master of his art."
2,Endless Plotting,"I'm a big fan of Shogun (4 1/2 stars) and Tai-Pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here. But after 450 pages I gave up. Plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters. I got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when I was ready for development and resolution of what came before.This book picks up with the Straun/Brock rivalry from Tai-Pan after an interval of 120 years. I wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what I read.The writing is still good and I may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but I had to move on to something more satisfying."
3,A typical action-drama,"Not bad, if you like a story about businessmen wheeling and dealing, although a bit long."
2,Kindle edition contains many type flaws,"I am not sure why, or how, so many typographical errors crept into the Kindle edition. For some examples, many words, lines, or parts of whole pages appear in bold type or italics in the Kindle edition but are not that way in the printed edition. There are also missing quotation marks, especially the end-quote marks. There are misplaced lines, apparently due to missing carriage returns. I enjoyed the story but the print flaws are just annoying. Please, Amazon, if you are going to charge so much for these electronic books, put a little quality into the product."
3,Noble House Series,"Many years back I happened upon the book 'Taipan' in a used bookstore in Berkeley. Little did I know then that I was about to embarc upon a fictional journey that would span the centuries as well as generations. 'Noble House' the somewhat sequel to Taipan is set in Hong Kong of the sixties and where the battle between the Straun and Brock families continue to wage not their sabres and cutlasses but clout and money in a ceaseless endeavor to dominate, or even demolish one another.Clavell a master storyteller in this and his other epics, but here he plays upon classic battle between families and offers an expose' into the world of the Orient, and those who would venture into this realm of mystique and beauty.Bottomline: Read Taipan before Noble House ...Or you'll be completely lost"
4,Noble House Can.,"The Nobel House is another story of a powerful semi-legal family with a charismatic and wise leader. Reminds me of the Godfather in many ways. One of James Cavell best. Nobel House is a fine example of his understanding of human nature and attention to detail. He pulls off a mini education of how the rich think of the poor, Hong Kong and China without detracting from the story. The entire series of the ""Noble House"" books have been stories worth reading."
4,noble house,excellent read.follows the pattern set forth by the author's prevous works in the asian theme. where may I find the Whirlwind book?
4,"Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying Nothing","""Noble House,"" James Clavell's epic story of Hong Kong, is long (over 1,300 pages), and it has a rich plot with a rich cast of characters. Over the course of one week, a lot seems to happen, but nothing really happens because not that much changes. There's some deaths and some sex, but really this book is occupied mainly by swearing and intrigue.If Clavell's understanding of Hong Kong is correct (and we have no reason to suspect that it is not), then Hong Kong is run by a bunch of incestuous pirates. Its wealth and power derive from it being mainland China's strategic entrepot to the world, which is also what accounts for its instability and intrigue.It's a great book for those who have some understanding and some contact with Hong Kong. Otherwise, it really is nothing more than sound and fury."
5,Excellent!,"Gripping story that prompted me to start reading Taipan, King Rat, Shogun... Highly recommended!"
4,Another Great Clavell Novel,"This is a long book, but then it is just part of Clavell's running story, and really fits in with well with Tai-Pan. This is a lot more up to date, as it is set in the early nineteen-sixties. I love how the author has the orientals characterize the Americans and English (loud, rude, obnoxious, etc). There is several threads of rommance that run through the book, all the while it is mainly a spy story. You have to stretch a little bit to think this is a believable story, but just kick back and enjoy the different cultural flavor the book brings. The fact that Hong Kong was a British Territory helped me believe some of the improbable legal and financial situations that developed. All in all a long enjoyable book."
5,Simply Amazing,"This was the first James Clavell book I had read, and now I am eager to read all of the others. In a word, Noble House is amazing. In its breadth and scope it is unsurpassed by any novel I have ever read. It is gripping from the Prologue where you introduced to the main character, Ian Dunross to the awe-inspiring conclusion. The characters are all well-formed, and you feel like you know them intimately. Their faults and good qualities are all known by the reader. Don't be discouraged by the book's weight and length. It will fly by. Even though the book weighs a pound, it is very hard to put down. This is a book that makes me want to tell anyone who can read that they should read this book."
1,Monumentally slow and tedious,"I found the characters amusing for a while, but after it just slowly grinds on and on for page after page I started to just wish they would die.I can't believe this relatively simple story takes so long to tell. Worse than that it is padded with repetition, so it isn't a huge painting with a small and interesting subject, it's a lot of nothing much with some minor relief to the boredom.And then in five minutes it's all sorted out. The main character does the obvious thing, which would probably make anyone else a pariah. Everything before and after those five minutes hardly matters. Even the disasters don't really matter to the story. Though they do matter to the characters."
5,places Daniel Parker in context,This book places Daniel Parker in the context of his times. Interesting & Informative
3,It's the same as the cheaper bags,"The only difference between this sleeping bag and the less expensive Wenzel bags is the nicer plastic storage bag and the use of elastic straps instead of string for rolling it up. I would buy the cheaper ones, since the storage bag is practicaly useless anyway.Other than that, it is very comfortable and soft. The fabric is warm as is the sleeping bag itself. I doubt it will last more than a few years without losing much of its insulating value since given its filling."
4,"Good Story, what more do you need?",Libertus the Pavement Maker returns in the second of Rosemary Rowe's novels on Roman Britain set in the second century AD.Libertus is a witness to a stabbing on the streets of Corinium (modern day Cirencester). Luckily for the victim a physician is hand and a tragedy is averted. However Libertus is commanded by his wealthy patron Marcus Septimus to investigate the attack. This is no where near the end of the matter and Libertus soon becomes embroiled in another case of murder and intrigue. These books are well researched and the storytelling is excellent. I commend them to you.
5,Love it; ordered a second one for a friend's birthday.,SO happy to see Kenny Rogers again with a hit CD
2,Not your backyard variety,My 4 year old daughter is in love with bugs and so I went looking for books on the subject. We have a couple other Big Books and they are great but this one was a bit too exotic and the backyard variety of bugs was missing. My daughter wanted to see the common bugs she sees everyday. It was a disapointment for both of us.
5,Bug Crazy Kid,I have a 2 1/2 year old son who is crazy about bugs. This book has real photographs of all kinds of bugs. The photos are large and show a lot of detail. He loves this book and wants to look at it daily. I would definitely recommend this book for any child who is crazy about bugs.
2,Bugs,The title is deceptive. It is a children's book with very large pictures of very few insects. I wanted a book with more info than it contains.
3,Few pages and not enough common bugs,"It's definitely a big book in overall size, but I was disappointed in the number of pages and quantity of information inside. The pictures are vibrant and a great teaching tool. My 4 year old son thinks it's great, but I think they're gross! But, hey the book's not for me! I bought this book with a bug vaccuum and bug jar to teach him about the bugs he caught, but it mostly shows bugs that are exotic and poisonous. It had to spend a few minutes reassuring him that the bugs he was about to collect with his new toys weren't going to hurt him. I should have found a book that had more common bugs that we find around our area."
1,Never got the book and it's been a month...,I ordered this book for a friend's son's birthday. I have tried to find out why they haven't gotten it and they say it is still in transit... I can't get a straight answer from anybody.
4,Lots of bug information,This is a really cool book. There are lots of pictures and great facts. I just wish more insects had been included.
5,good book,my daughter loves bugs so this gave her more info.it has detailed pictures and more info than your average picture book.
3,The book is BIG,This has some good information within but a couple of the other books I got at the same time were much better suited for my needs. I'm sure it has a niche somewhere.....
5,A True Sleeper!,"The first time I knew this movie existed, I found it movie in the DVD section at my local library. I never heard about it... never saw a trailer anywhere... never saw or read any reviews about it anywhere. So I borrowed it because Haley Joel Osment was in it, whom I think is a wonderful child actor. What an absolutley delightful and beautifully crafted movie this is. Others before told you of the plot. I will just say this: HOW can such a gem have been so inadequately promoted or recognized?? Why has it been kept so secret? But, like a true treasure, this film sparkels. Everything in it works so well: casting, direction, acting, music, visuals.... it is a masterpiece! This is how a movie is supposed to be made. Wonderful... simply wonderful!"
4,Really cut movie,Why do some of you think Whoopi's character didn't like the boy because he was white? I'm pretty sure his mom was white and she and Whoopi were friends!This is such a cute movie. I just love the little boy and the way he acts.
3,I liked it; my kids didn't,"My kids (8 and 11) kept waiting for the funny parts - which never came. The 8-year-old enjoyed it more than the older one. The scene where the mother dies in a car crash is very graphic so beware. This was hard for us because we lost a grandmother this way. Other than that, I thought the whole thing was charming. While child actor did well, Gérard Depardieu is always the best thing about any movie he's in."
1,WHOOPI GOLDBERG AS A BIGOT!,"The Whoopi Goldburg charter is disturbing to say the least. She wants nothing to do with Albert (Haley Joel Osment the little boy from THE SIXTH SENCE) because the kid is white. Turn it around for a moment, what would we say about a white woman who with holds love from a black kid because of the color of his skin? Are we suppose to think that Osment is responsible for the slave trade of one hundred fifty years ago?The poor kid is dangling from a fire escape his life in danger. Any fan of THE SIXTH SENSE would rush out to save him in no time flat but not Goldburg. All she does is call out encouragement to him.I kept hoping someone from Child Protective Services would show up to take poor Osment away from Goldburg but no such luck. I think the kid deserved much better!"
3,China Cry,"This book is about the Chinese missionary that my parents worked for for several years. It was not the book that I was looking for, but it is okay."
2,World of Hammer Dracula,"I purchased the Frankenstein one, it was'nt as good. I tell you, I think these tapes should've been longer. But they sure do put in a lot of stuff in a small slot.It seems Oliver Reed voiced this when he was older because I can barely hear him. A couple of the films in the series were left out and I found it annoying since that nothing besides the footage was in it."
4,Christopher Lee is the classic dracula,"Christopher Lee portrays the ultimate Dracula!The movie does not come up to the level of HORROR OF DRACULA,but it is a wonderful movie!Great narrations by Oliver Reed.If you purchase this movie, put it in the VCR,turn out the lights,and stock up on junk food cause this movie is gonna keep you up and shivering all night. This is one of Christopher Lee's greatest performances.If your a fan of Lee,you'll LOVE this movie!"
4,Cobra,"This radio was bought for over the road traveling. I was attracted to this radio for several reasons weather radio,scan feature,and compact design. The radio has preformed excellent,and is small enough to put in any car or truck. I had only two problems with this radio, First the scan feature only works when the squelch is turned up high enough to elliminate ""fuzz"" which dosent allw you to pick up and scan weak signals, Second this radio dose not have a SWR meter(Standing Wave Ratio) which means to have your antenna tuned yu have to buy a SWR meter or take it to a CB shop which can be a hassle. Other than that this radio is perfect and dose a fine job."
2,Cobra 18 WX ST II CB 40 Channels,"I like the scan feature,I like the Weather feature.I picks up too much RF noise ie:Power line noise, engine noise"
2,"Known ""Birdie"" on one of the channels","A ""birdie"" is a spurious signal generated within the radio, such that this signal can be heard by the radio. In this case, the 18WXSTII has one channel that seems like it always has a signal on it, and that signal is the birdie. I think it was channel 4. The birdie signal was loud enough that it would block out any medium or weak real signals. Now, in other wide-band general-coverage radios that use synthesized frequency generation, it is common to hear a few birdies. But, since CB only uses 40 channels, you'd think they could design it so that there would not be any birdies on those frequencies. When I talked to the Cobra technical support person, he admitted the birdie was a design problem and all the units have it. This was several years ago. It may be fixed by this time. Anyway, the tech agreed to exchange the radio, and I ended up getting a slightly more expensive model. I was happy with their support but sad about their design problems."
2,Not so great,"I've had this CB for 10 months now. The main reasons I bought it for are the compact size and multi-scan features, which work well. However two real big gripes about this radio are no RF gain control and it's ""super shiny light reflecting"" black tinted face which makes it extremely difficult to read what channel you're on in daylight. I often have to have the squelch set so high to block static (from everywhere), that I don't get reception anyway. It also makes a little static ""tick"" noise as it does it two channel priority watch scan, which I find very annoying. In fact, I no longer turn the radio on when I'm in the vehicle. I would not buy this model radio again and am planning to replace it."
2,not as good as i was hoping,"when i considered buying this for my car and started looking at the reviews i knew it was going to be a toss up wether it was going to be a quality product or not, i liked that it had the front firing speaker and the soundtracker system, which the radio i have in my tractor for work(cobra25) also has the soundtracker system and it works great, but when i recieved it and set it up with a 2ft wilson antenna its performance was less then exceptional, radio is very noisy even with the soundtracker system on. this radio constantly freezes(when i turn it on it will be stuck on ch9 and you wont be able to change channels use the weatherband or anything, you have to turn it off and hope for the best next time you turn it on) and the front firing speaker is very quiet. i should have went with another cobra25 and just bought an external speaker"
2,Not too impressed...,This item rattles like crazy in my jeep now. I've only had it for 6 months and I have not abused it at all. The item is obnoxious. I'm thinking about taking it out of my jeep. Reception is not great and I have a fire stick 4 foot on my jeep. Too bad...
2,???,"Sleeve is good, does NOT include cable pouch. Seller will not respond to my emails. Beware!!! Cable pouch is listed in the description but is NOT included. Otherwise sleeve works well, protects and does not scratch macbook."
5,"MacBook Pro 15"" 2011","Perfect fit.This case is designed so the laptop won't touch the zipper upon insertion or removal. I like to put my laptop into one of these cases before putting it in the messenger bag. Adds a little protection, and sometimes you just don't want to haul the whole bag into the coffee shop.Only con is that it says MB 15.4"" with a big square on the front. They could have put their product label inside the bag.I'm keeping this one and sending theLaCie Coat 15-Inch MacBook Carrying Case 130920 (Black)back. See my other reviews. It is worth the additional money."
4,Good to go,"Very good-language is a little rough in areas, but it's an over-all good film. Anyone who likes crime drama should like this film."
2,For Wannabe Movie Loving Losers Only.,"Viewed: 11/12Rate: 311/12: After seeing and being impressed with House of Games, I went to The Spanish Prisoner and liked it too. Not getting enough, Homicide was next for me. Needless to say, it was a disappointing film to see. Any time I see William Macy in a movie, he has always stunk it up with his phony acting. The same phony acting that he keeps showing for years and years...it never dies for him, does it? That was the first mistake of Homicide. The second was the terrible theatrical dialogues everybody was engaged in. It was all artificial to me. The third was the contrived, horribly outdated plot with the stupidest plot twist imaginable. Honestly, I thought for a minute it was going to be confidence game thing, but that never materialized. At least David Mamet more than made up for it in The Spanish Prisoner. The fourth was the ending...yeah, right. All in all, that was a disappointment for me in Homicide; I had my expectations high."
1,"Great movie, but bad DVD","If only this movie came on a normal Region coding i could watch it on my DVD player and not my laptop. This is one of Mamets great films only second to ""Sparten."" A must watch if you can find on normal DVD, but like the orginal ""Blade Runner,"" you may never get it on DVD. later!"
4,perfectly good transfer,"No matter what movie comes on on DVD, somebody is going to say, ""Horrible DVD, like a VHS, horrible quality DVD.""This transfer is excellent. Nothing wrong with it at all."
5,wonderful,Who couldnt enjoy such a book. Antonio's books are filled with humorous remarks and at the very same time it possesses very intriguing facts about all the places he visits. I highly recommend this book. Antonio has changed his life drastically just to fulfill his dream of being a writer and an adventurer and now he is sharing all of it with us on paper. BUY IT! READ IT! ENJOY IT!
4,Some great songs and mutch more mainstream than usual.,"A good CD with some great songs, usaully I like all there songs but with this one I only like about 70% which is more than most cds for most bands so still definitely a great CD."
2,Very disappointed...,"I have been a big fan of Pillar since I discovered them with the Fireproof album. I enjoyed listening to Fireproof and Where Do We Go From Here over and over, which is against my norm of listening to an album a couple times and ditching it.I have to say that Pillar definitely took a step backwards with this album. Certainly not the quality, or the hard-core sound I enjoyed in their previous two albums.Hopefully they figure it out for the next album, if there is one. I'll give them another shot because I know they can be great... If you are into metal, and into Christian rock, I have so far found few that can match their sound."
4,Classic Mystery,"Peter Wimsey solves a classic locked-room mystery, as he tries to determine how the corpse of an elderly man came to be in the Bellona Club on Remembrance Day. The man died sometime after 10am, but the exact time of death is a mystery. It becomes a pressing mystery when it becomes clear that the time of death determines who will inherit a large fortune. The convoluted family argument and complex relationships make Wimsey's efforts more difficult. Halfway through the book the culprit seems to be apprehended, but Wimsey isn't so sure. I liked the model of a solution partway through the book that had to be unraveled.This book had little engagement with Wimsey's life outside of the mystery. It is a book dependent upon Wimsey entering an existing situation. The details are numerous, and we get an interesting look at a London gentlemen's club in the 1920s. Overall, an entertaining classic mystery."
4,Wimsey is Wonderful,"i finished The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club today. Wimsey is brought in on a completely unsuspicious death to determine the exact time of death. If the old General died before his equally old sister, the money goes to the sister's companion, if after, to the General's two sons. Of course, events get curious and Wimsey has to use a good bit of his cleverness to figure it all out. I certainly didn't guess who the killer was.I guess I like Wimsey because he's all competence and properness covered by quips and a bit of playing the buffoon. He's clever and but haunted. The setting is just so British it's a bit weird; it is like a fantasy novel as it is just so different from what life is today. Quite well written."
3,Classic Sayers,This captures class and English crime fiction about as well as anything ever published. Sayers is at her usual best in creating a parlor mystery and Lord Peter is at her best in solving a somewhat complicated crime.
3,"Literary virtues, perhaps, but not my favorite Lord Peter","I'm sorry to say that I did not enjoy this segment of the Lord Peter series. I do think the other reviewers are correct in their assessment of the literary virtues of this work and of the author. My problem is with the idioms of the era. I found myself wishing I had a ""Lord Peter to English"" Dictionary! Please don't misunderstand me - I like this series and I have a growing respect for Dorothy Sayers' work. I simply found myself wondering what on earth these people (the characters in the novel) were talking about. But I bet my grandmother, a contemporary of Lord Peter, would have known...I am reading Sayers' works in order of publication, and so far Clouds of Witness is my favorite."
2,you really dont want one,"This is a good radio dont get me wrong however, let me explain. I have had one for about three years then the problems started. The main thing is now it transmits intermediately and the problem is in the new design. It seems to save money (not yours) they have put a couple of small circuit boards with non repairable components on the main board. eventually with the bouncing and jarring these crack. My tech. cannot repair it and cobra doesnt want to sell him the parts. So i basically have a small boat anchor. Plus he told me that the sound tracker models are mainly junk. the only two he recomended were the classics and he told me that for the money the unidens are best deal and withstand the abuse better. (he doesnt even stock a cobra). I am a truck driver and the radios do go through some rough riding. I have switched to uniden!"
5,Stewart Little ***,"60, 38, 16 & 11 were the ages of our family at the theatre. Boys and girls. We all thought Stewart was great. Couldn't wait to purchase the video for our home collection and to watch over & over. Take Stewart Little at face value, its funny, heartwarming, cute and may cause a sniffle or two (if you have a heart) Hello! It's a kids movie, sit back , relax and enjoy."
4,stuart,I love the Stuart Little movies; and this was the first one. I am disappointed that in a childrens movie they needed to swear. I am getting a little tired of having to screen everything before I share it with my grandchildren.
3,Stuart Little without Mr Whites charm,"This movie is visually very very cute. Hugh Laurie is terrific as always. The mouse is darling. But the storyline does not resemble the book much, and I was much disturbed by the evil fake parents who come to take him from the adoptive ones. This is a movie for little children yet it shows Stuart being led to his death by his supposed mouse parents. When will disney stop making movies about evil mothers? Children can be entertained without being terrorized by such stupid ideas. Read the book to your child, watch a Wooster and Jeeves movie, enjoy Michael Fox in something else, and skip this one.."
5,Adorable Movie for all ages!,"This movie was very entertaining! It was very wholesome but brings out your imagination. All ages could learn from the theme on ""how to accept those who are different"". Don't try to over analyze this one - just open your mind and enjoy the great special effects! I recommend this for any family movie night!"
4,Stuart Little was a B-I-G hit in our house .....,"especially with our 3-year-old son. He has such a short attention span, but this one interested him a lot. I think the mixture of characters (people, cats, mice, etc.) made it more appealing. I personally only saw about half the movie, but I adored the cats (Especially Snowbell).It's purely fantasy (a couple with a son adopt a mouse?????) however, it is an entertaining movie that parents should not be concered about their kids viewing. Adults might even like it too."
3,Not that bad,"This movie is not as increadibly stupid as I thought it would be, it's really not that bad. It's about a little boy played by the adorable little Jonathan Lipniki, who wants a little brother, the parents get one at an adoption agency and ended up with stuart little, a mouse."
5,Cute Story of Two Brothers,"I thought this was the most adorable movie ever! My boyfriend and I went on Christmas (we're 22 and 21 years old), and we both loved it! Michael J. Fox was perfect as the voice of Stuart, and I've loved Jonathan Lipnicki since Jerry Maguire! Don't miss this cute movie!"
2,"If you liked the book, get Stuart 2 and skip this","Shyamalan rewrote the classic children's book by E.B. White, one the most respected and beloved authors in the English language. And in EBWHite's book, Stuart is NOT an orphan. He is happy and adventurous, and in his travels he charms everyone he meets with his friendly cheerful attitude and his concern for his friends. Shyamalan throws away the entire plot and recasts Stuart as a mopey little rodent looking for his real parents. Also, the book has lots of lively action for the kids while slipping in little verbal absurdities for the adult reader. Shyamalan's dark and lifeless version loses both. Get SL2, which is closer the original book."
2,HO HUM,I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A WHOLE LOT BETTER.THE MAN THING THAT BUGGED ME IS STURAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CHILD MOUSE SO WHY USE A ADULTS VOCIE. THERE WAS ONE PART A LIKED THOUGH ANDD THAT WAS THE PART WHEN THE ONE CAT SMILED AND SAID PLEASE. ALSO WHY DOES EVERY THINK JOTHAN LIPNICK IS SO CUTE. HE NOT THAT GREAT.
1,Annyoying 5 year olds movie.,"This is the typical American family movie that I love to hate. The Little family walked around wearing big cheesy grins, to a point where I wanted to punch the smiles off with my fist. Stuart is WAY too cute for my liking. The only time I was amused was when Stuart got stuck in the washing machine (unfortunatley, Mrs. Little got him out).Thank goodness this movie only went for an hour and a half. Any longer and I would've gone insane."
1,Charlotte's Web is better! OH MY SWEET TEMPLETON!,"CHARLOTTE'S WEB IS BETTER BECAUSE THE MOVIE HAD TEMPLETON IN IT. (TEMPLETON IS MY BOYFRIEND)! SO.. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW: ""RATS ARE BETTER THAN MICE!"" STUART LITTLE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT ON CHARLOTTE'S WEB! IF YOU THINK MY REVIEW IS HELPFUL, E-MAIL ME AT SweetRoxanne@hotmail.com IF YOU THINK IT'S NOT HELPFUL, E-MAIL ME AT Roxanne12@aol.com"
3,Big budget nonsense!,This movie was like watching a weird cartoon where utter nonsense is accepted as normal. Reminded me of Space Jam where seeing cartoon characters and space ships landing on ball fields are accepted as no big deal. This movie may have worked better as a cartoon but I think it failed miserably as a movie.
5,Delightful family entertainment,"Stuart Little is one of those rare films that the entire family can watch and enjoy together. Children will be completely enthralled and adults will alternately laugh uncontrollably and wipe away the odd sentimental tear.The basic plot revolves around the Little family, who adopt Stuart (a mouse) despite warnings to ""adopt within your own species.""The computer-generated animation is flawless, and those with pet cats or rodents will share a knowing smile or two as the watch their pets' various personalities acted out on the screen.The plot may be silly, sappy and somewhat simplistic, but your entire family will love to watch this film again and again as Stuart and his friends scamper into and sometimes across your heart. A wonderful film for everyone."
5,Something is wrong with his review..,"First and foremost, this is a show that's meant to be enjoyable, simple and fun and not to invoke deep thinking about why would the parents adopt a mouse when they have a boy.. Hello.. if we are to take things so logically and seriously all the time, why in the first place is this mouse talking? Some times I think a movie does not need to give a reason why-is-what but rather just tell it's story and if it flows well and is enjoyable, we have a winner."
4,This is a funny movie.,This is a funny movie. It is a kids movie. This one of those movie tha seams a little dumb but that is from an adult point of view. It is funny from a childs view though. This is one worth its money.
4,Not just for kids,"I've read mixed reviews on this film, mostly saying that it would appeal to young kids but nothing else. Well I don't agree. It is a delightfull and amusing family film full of messages about being different and still being able to fit in and underlining the importance of being part of a family unit. It's refreshing to sit back and immerse yourself in a world where a talking mouse is believable and leave behind all the violence, sex and swearing which has become part of most films today. The animation work is second to none, the humour is there and as I said before, the messages are clear. Great family entertainment and very under rated, much like ""Plesentville"" in that respect."
3,A somewhat charming movie.,"This movie does its job. It entertains the 4-10 year old viewer. My children enjoyed watching this movie; however, I don't foresee it becoming one of their favorites. The story line drags too much and the characters are too bland. The talking animals lack the wit of other movie and TV animals, notably the animals in Homeward Bound and the cat, Salem, in the TGIF Sabrina TV series. My youngest says that the outtakes are the best part of the Stuart Little DVD.Because my children had read the novel by E.B. White, they were disappointed by the changes in the story. In sum, this movie comes up OK. Oh, one special note---the special effects are great. Watch Stuart Little on a rainy Saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to do."
3,Stuart Little,I think the movie was cute. Geena Davis plays Stuart Little's Mother and Tom Laurie as his Father. They picked the right people in the movie.
4,Stuart Little DVD,Nice little movie. My kids both enjoyed it. I seemed to have some problems with the Wide Screen DVD on both my DVD players.
2,Have we no shame,"It's a crime and a sin what was done to E.B. White's classic children's novel. Heartless Hollywood got hold of it, ripped its guts out, threw in some snazzy effects, irrelevant slapstick, and rock music, and dared to call it ""Stuart Little."" All in the name of money. I'm not saying some six year-olds won't have fun watching it, but for the love of integrity, someone please read them the book."
4,cute film,"This is not a bad film at all, and i actually liked a few of the differences from the book. In the book, Mrs. Little suddenly gives birth to a mouse (how or why is never explained) but here, Stuart is adopted from an orphanage by the Littles, and I feel that in this aspect, the movie was better than the book. Infact, while I do recommend the book, I feel that the movie definitely did better in some parts than the book, so the film is definitely worth checking out."
1,suartlittle,they don't talk about funny stuffsthey don't pretend to be dead.They don't go fast with a car.Can't put them to a jail.Can't have a hot rideCan't go full blast with a car
3,"cute movie,but unrealistic","a really good kid's movie.get this for your kids age 1-5.no older than that,because the movie was just a whole fairy tale because none of the people were even surprised that stuart little could talk.good cast. Geena Davis as the mom,Michael J Fox,and i think i recognized Jennifer Tilly's voice as Stuart's fake mom.so this is an okay movie"
4,Fun for the whole family - great DVD,"Great movie for the entire family - fun and sweet for the adults, and nothing harmfull for the little ones - no adult themes here. Nice moral of being different is ok and you can still be 'family' even if you don't look alike. Great DVD production values - tons of extras, many for the kids, many on the effects. A sure bet."
5,Keep Stuart Little in mind.,Every time I think of Stuart Little I am happy.The first Stuart Little story was especially enduring to read aloud.
4,Different from the book...,"The movie was a lot different from the book. In the book was better. In the movie, Stuart is adopted and is made a part of the cheesy Little family. The effects were very good, though. Mouse Trap was much funnier, but this one is great for little kids."
4,Excellent Innocent Fun,"I purchased Stuart Little on the strength of the cinematic trailer because I wanted to add another entertaining family film to my collection - I am pleased to say that I was not disappointed.The computer animation is top notch but it's more than just an eye candy film - it's a skillful retelling of a heart-warming story.Stuart himself is an entertaining character, but other characters also get a look in with funny lines (Snowball, the cat, comes out with a couple of classics). I also enjoyed Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis as the oh-so-nice Mr and Mrs Little; tongue in cheek performances but not so much as to demean their characters.Finally, I'd also like to give top marks to the producers of the DVD. They've bundled in plenty of options to add value to the package, including two different voiceovers from people involved with making the film, an insight in the special effects, a game and even some music videos."
1,The credits were the funniest part,"It would have been so easy to make this into a funny movie. All they needed was more cute and slapstick mouse humor. They missed every opportunity, until the credits were rolling. Then, in a small video window next to the scrolling text, was every funny scene we'd seen in the previews.Skip this one. Rent Toy Story instead."
3,Delightful film for whole family,"This is a delightful family film, loosely based on the E.B. White classic of the same name. The real star here is Michael J. Fox whose voice is just perfect for Stuart. The computerized special effects were justly Oscar nommed. The editing is also worthy of mention. It's great fun with villianous cats after Stuart and getting their comeuppance in the end. Very worth a rental."
2,Too bad no one read the book,"This movie called Stuart Little because its title character is a mouse, not because it has anything to do with E.B White's book of the same name. I felt like I was watching a re-telling of ""Annie"" rather than seeing a film version of a great story. A typical result of creating a giant marketing and merchandising machine."
4,Dying on vacation,While at times the list nature of the names of the dead were tedious overall the book was an interesting tell of the foolishness of man in the great outdoors. It seems if there is a way for man to die he has accomplished it in Yellowstone.
5,"Very interesting, educational, and entertaining.","A fascinating book about all the people who have died in Yellowstone (excluding auto accidents and illness). It seems strange that a book about death would be fun to read, but I definitely enjoyed this one. It also gives some good examples of what NOT to do when in Yellowstone. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has been to Yellowstone or is interested in the park."
5,Sad humor,"I purchased this book in 1999 while visiting the park with my family. Whittlesey presents a candid look at the varying degrees of human stupidity and the tragic consequences. In one way, this book portrays a sad picture of the human race, with tales of people trying to ride on top of bison or swim in scalding hot springs. In a warped, twisted way, I found some of the tales amusing.Several of the stories would be great submissions to the Darwin Awards. If you're the type of person who enjoys reading such material then this book would be great for you."
3,Starts off good,"Book starts out great with an incredible story about a mishap in a hot spring, unfortunately most of the remaining stories of disaster are no where near as colorful. There are way to many names thrown around in the various stories for me to keep track of.Not a long read, 200pgs but after about 150 I found myself just wishing I was done with it.Great for kind of a historical document about deaths in the area, but since no maps of the area were provided it means almost nothing to me (I have never been to the park).Average book, just not great like i was hoping."
5,One of the best books a Yellowstone lover could ever get.,"This book details deaths in the park, from accidents in hot water to falls from thousands of feet. This book will definitely inhance your awareness of danger and pleasure in the park. Will keep you on the edge of your seat, and scare you to death at the same time. Very well written, and also documented with sources for further information. A must have for anyone who has ever been to Yellowstone!"
5,Very Eye Opening!,"After visiting Yellowstone for the first time in my life I wanted to know more about it. After reading this book I was first amazed at the stupid things that people have done with total disregard of the warnings posted everywhere, and in the information that is given to them at the gate. I can not imagine anyone taking their child and setting them on the back of a bison, or trying to pet a bear. I will never fish in Yellowstone Lake, or in any of the rivers even though I saw people doing that. I will never camp there. My future visits to the park will be in the day time and totally in obedience to the rules of the park. I think everyone should visit the park at least once in their life because there are wonders there that you will never see any where else....but, follow the rules people! They are there for a reason. Read this book first and you will see why."
3,I read this while at Yellowstone,"My wife wasn't sure that this was a good use of my reading time. While in Yellowstone, I was able to point out the geysers where people were boiled alive, regions where grizzlies had dismembered their victims and buffaloe had gored ignorant tourists. If you enjoy reading about stuff like this, this is a good one to have...maybe just keep it to yourself while your out with the family."
4,A somewhat entertaining historical account,"Given my odd sense of humor, I wasn't suprised that I liked this book. While tragic, the deaths accounted for remind us that when we're dealing with nature, we must deal with it on its own rules. The ""pedestrians have the right-of-way"" attitude won't cut it out there, folks! Of course some deaths were not the result of the individuals foolishness, but also by accident or bad luck."
3,"Interesting, but the Grand Canyon Death Book is better","Had some good stories for sure. Getting lost and dying in the springs was amazing. Worth buying, but the same title for the GCNP was really amazing."
2,Not well written,"While the content of the book was interesting, the actual writing to deliver the content was cringe worthy and unbearable. I felt as if I was reading a report written by a C+ average 4th grader at times. I realize the level of detail necessary to draw out the story behind some of the deaths was not and could not be gotten, but the book reads like a laundry list for extended sections. While I did learn from the unfortunate mistakes and accidents of others by way of this book, I simply cannot recommend this book for any entertainment value you may be seeking from a well constructed series of sentences and/or paragraphs."
3,Hammertoe Cushion,"Well-made product. I had some difficulty with the vendor, which Amazon resolved right away. The concept is good, but I'd recommend purchasing the three-pack gel toe crest by Silipos. It's more economical and handy to have several of them."
5,Totally engaging,"My girls - 5 and 8 - love this book. I read it to them three months ago and we still talk about ""igglyplops"" and ""bealy"" things. The story is compelling -- three kids in a world of giants. The giants have their own language, but kids can identify with the giant childrens' normal everyday lives. There's an imagined world, suspense, and siblings who grow to love one another -- who could ask for anything else?"
5,My 7-yr-old's Favorite Book,"My 7-year old daughter checked this book out at her school library and it quickly became her constant companion. She loved the book so much that she begged us to get her own copy of it. Not only does she like the story of little people, but the characters have their own language ('Groilish'). It has inspired her to come up with her own language ('Isabel-ish')."
1,Not so Hot,"I am a 13-year old girl (I really am 13, I just didnt understand the adult reveiw system) re-doiecorating my room, and I needed a book for ideas. I ordered this book expecting many different styles and ideas for rooms, but I was very disapointed. There are only eight different rooms, and I feel that they were all very much out-dated. I wanted something hip and current (like most teens want), but that book really wasnt that at all."
2,Not very many options,"I do not think that this book had a lot of crafts that many teens would like. One of the rooms was so childish and colorful that I could not imagine many teens wanting. There were a couple ideas that were okay, like table covers and lamps, but not a lot of the crafts were things i would imagine a lot of teens wanting. The title is also misleading - it's not really a big book of teen rooms - it's a small book of out-dated pre-teen rooms."
1,Terrible Phone - AT&T lies,"Phone is awful - how is this a $149 phone when it was available on prepay for $20 with $25 free airtime? They send it to you for 'free"" - lock you into a 2yr contract and then charge you 10x the actual cost of the phone for ETF. Consumer protection needs to come to the telecom ""industry"" and it needs to come soon"
4,contents,"This collection contains the following stories: ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card; ""Fire Watch"" by Connie Willis; ""Air Raid"" by John Varley; ""Lady in the Tower"" by Anne McCaffrey; ""The Postman"" by David Brin; ""Blood Music"" by Greg Bear; and ""Beggars in Spain"" by Nancy Kress. Each story also has a short introduction by the author discussing what their inspiration was for the story."
4,Great way to find new authors,"I'm always on the lookout for good, what I call ""real science fiction"" writers and this book has them. I have now ordered most of the books that evolved from the short stories contained in this collection. (I'm a big Asimov fan and like stories that are futuristic but believable.)"
1,Not too good for my tastes,"I am currently using this item for my introductory Emglish Literature I course. For Beowulf, they spelled Wealtheow and Edgetheow wrong. And look at the Canterbury Tales, they only have the modern English text for the general prologue, where is the modern english text for the miller's tale, wife of bath's tale, pardoner's tale, nun priest's tale, and the parson's tale? The text in the Canterbury Tales is a little harder to understand without the Modern English translation. Even through this textbook has 624 pages, as soon as I finish my English Literature I course, I am going to sell the text because there are too many mistakes on it and I might plan to buy the Norton version instead with the money, it looks better anyway and it has higher ratings than this text."
3,This anthology was required reading for a course,"I purchased the Longman Anthology of British Literature Vol. 1A because it was required reading for a course I was enrolled in. Amazon had it listed for much cheaper than the university bookstore, so that is the reason I bought this here."
2,Not very good,"I'm not a huge fan of Medieval literature, and perhaps this book is to blame. I think I've been spoiled by the Norton and Bevington anthologies I've used in other classes, because this was truly a let-down. If you're a prof looking for a good book to use for class, have your students spend the extra twenty-spot and get a Norton."
5,Learn how to get the most out of your 24 hour day.,The one thing that we all have but use differently is the 24 hour day. No one gets more than 24 hours in a day. The people in control are the people that know how to effectively manage the 24 hours in a day. No one can save time. We can only use time. The ones that use time wisely get more done and are more successful.
5,One of the three or four most helpful books I've ever read.,"It helped me go from being mediocre as a junior in college to being accomplished as a senior in college, while giving me a sense of control and of hope about accomplishing what I wanted to accomplish in life. And many of its tips and recommendations still help me organize myself on a daily basis, 17 years later. I cannot recommed this book highly enough. Read it, give it to people you love."
4,This book changed my life... seriously......,"I seriously feel that this book changed my life. After reading this book the way I looked at the world changed. I now realize that I don't need to get everything on my ""to do"" list done. I only focus on the top priorities. I've purchased more than 10 copies of this book to share with friends and co-workers. Great book."
2,"Good, but ""Getting Things Done"" is better","I quite liked Alan Lakein's book, and got a lot of mileage out of it. However, I found his systems a little too simple to deal with the reality of my daily life. I'm in the middle of *Getting Things Done"" by David Allen, and I find that it's much more real world. It also holds your hand a little more (e.g., step-by-step instructions on how to quickly get to the bottom of your inbox). If you (like me) are out of time and need to get organized, skip straight past Lakein and go directly to Allen."
1,"How about a revision, Mr. Lakein?","I found this book to be very outdated, especially in reference to women. The modern household and the roles of women in the workplace have changed dramatically in the decades since Lakein wrote this book. The men in my class LOVED the book, but we women found it to be irrelevant and, quite frankly, patronizing to women. To follow his extensive steps consistently in prioritizing life's responsibilities would take more time than actually DOING those things. Ladies, there has to be a better, more timely volume of advice out there for us on this subject. Mr. Lakein, I believe it's time for a revision."
2,It's ain't worth reading the whole book,"PROS: Reminds people (over and over again) to be skeptical. It's objective and doesn't always side with one political agenda. It teaches general skepticism and intelligent reading of the news, polls, and scientific reports.CONS: The book doesn't need to be so long. The first two pages of each chapter was all I needed to get the point. The rest is just details.CONCLUSION: For those who love the details of how the media can mislead the public, this is a great book. For most of us, just browse this book and you'll get the idea."
4,"Great book, wish there was more of it!","The book is very informative, and fairly concise, which is probably my only criticism of it. I would have loved to read more case studies! Actually, something like this should have a newsletter.. hmmm hey authors, how about something via email?I was already suspicious of much I heard in the media, but this book fully opened my eyes. I will no longer just take for granted the conclusions reached by our esteemed media.Read it, and pass it around to your friends and family, it can only serve to open their eyes as well, that is, assuming they want to open them.."
1,Another boilerplate piece of corporate denialism,"More raw meat for the dopes, as the genuflecting huzzahs from the troops above demonstrate.The only good thing about it is it combines in one volume nearly all the salient features of a right-wing corporate handout.It starts off with a lie - that the CMPA is nonpartisan - it's yet another in the stable of Olin/Scaiffe/Bradley funded ""think-tanks"" used to attack science, regulation, and public health.One chapter uses cherry-picking, all of them use weasel words, and most use debauched and invalid statistics.Meanwhile, it tromps heavily on the themes Thomas Frank mentioned in What's the Matter with Kansas - an appeal to you, the common man right-wing crank who's just as good as any pinko academic scientist any day!Oh. It hasn't aged very well, has it?"
2,"okay, but derivative","Lots of interesting examples but too many of them seem to come from a right-wing perspective. Also the book, which is humorless, reminds me of other better-done accounts of the same areas. The lessons of the book should be applied to the book itself. It doesn't fare well if this is done."
3,Thought Provoking,"I watched this movie and it stuck with me for several hours. Since I remember the energy crisis back in the '70s, when this film was done, I picked up on a number of cultural references of the time. Not to mention we again have the same sort of problems going on today with high fuel costs.And since I'm an English major, this allowed me to dissect the story line and pick on several references that explain the end. The frightening final use for the transfer system for instance. The people found in the rail cars and the deaf girl the group found, are all clues to the final scene.What I did find annoying was no clear reference to what happened to create such a world nor the fate of what happened to the rest of the group heading for the coast.Finally, the film was an interesting experiment and could be used as an exercise in story telling for classes. I would recommend it for anyone who likes to think about visual images and story lines."
3,One of my most vivid memories from when I was 8,"I was reading an article about earliest memories and I remembered the ending of this movie from a drive inn movie trip.But all I could remember was the premise of Humans as fuel....So did a google search and found this title.I'll have to watch this again, since sci-fi is my favorite genre.Had to be a good movie if I remember it 39 years later, right?"
3,"Yes, dated, but a pleasure and haunted me for 30 years","Hey, Peter, if you're out there, I liked your unappreciated film.Look, I like Fellini and Antonioni and DeSica and Scorcese, but this early, unsung effort by Peter Fonda has some eerie spell, and a haunting litte music theme that was ahead of its time. Yes, it has 1973 written all over it, so what. It's competently done, and I found myself ... transported. The ending is sick, twisted, funny, and hey, considering how the yuppies behaved in the 80s and 90s, I don't see it as altogether improbable.It's not a popular film to like - even then it was hushed away by Big Money, even after Jay Cocks gave it a great review in TIME. The prognistication for man changing his greed was dire, and no one in SUV-Consciousness still wants to hear anything bad about their football team. I mean, 'Get With the Program! 'Ummm, to quote the little kid in the UltraLexus at the end,""What happens when we run out of them, Daddy?"""
4,Pick A Bigger Weapon: Da Bomb,"This is an excellent album with positive beats and an even better message. The Coup are awesome & I'm planning on picking up the rest of their CDs as soon as I can. Non-mainstream, non-conformative, thought-provoking hip hop at its finest. I fully recommend."
5,Amazing; Fitting for the times...,"After having seen them for the first time at the Montreal Jazz Festival, I had to run out and buy this album (got it yesterday). As the Editorial Review says, the beats are amazing and the political commentary especially poignant. Boots is as smooth as they come and the whole album is thoroughly enjoyable. Time to listen to Steal This Double Album tonight..."
2,Meh..,"I like listening to the Coup occasionally. But some of the songs on this album just aren't good. And I don't think that's the album, I think thats just the nature of the group. Don't get me wrong, I love the lyrics, and what the band stands for. but musically, compared to a lot of other underground hip hop groups, they just dont do it for me."
3,"Decent album, but lacks in a few departments","Each song on this album starts off with good direction, but a few minutes into each one and it still hasn't gone anywhere. There's few buildups, no variation, and weak beat changes for the choruses if there even are any. Don't get me wrong, this album has good beats with good intentions, but it's not complete.Example: Track 4.Simply put, Coup forgot to put a drummer in this track. They have bass beats, but no snare, high hat, cymbal, tom's, nothing. even if they put a simple snare kick to at least give the song a reason instead of just a rhyme. This track features Black Thought and Talib Kweli, two of my favorite rappers, and to see their talent go to waste on such a bland song is a shame.Once again, this CD is just ok. You might just want to rip tracks 3, 5, 7, & 13 off the internet and save your money to buy better funky stuff from George Clinton, Lyrics Born, or Breakstra."
1,Not worth buying,"Get something else. This is a USB 1.1, not USB 2.0. So, it does not work well with, say, a USB 2.0 flash drive. And, it may not work at all with a USB 2.0 flash drive. Normally, I could plug my USB 2.0 flash drive into a USB 1.1 port and use it, even though I get an initial alert saying a detected device will perform better on a USB 2.0 port. However, a PNY USB 2.0 flash drive I own would not work at all with this USB hub. I can plug the flash drive directly into the same USB port on the computer and use it but it will not work with this hub.The cable on this hub is only about 18 inches long, so you'll probably need to use an extension cable if you want to connect it to the back of a tower PC sitting on the floor."
4,Does what it's made to do,"If you need a long cabled desktop hub - then choose that. and pay moreIf you need a specific 2.0 powered hub - then choose that. and pay moreIf you need a simple, compact, basic hub for a laptop. This is fine. and is 1/4 the price...."
3,Good intro textbook,"I used this book in my intro to programming class that I took in college. I already had taken a programming class while in high school, so the concepts in programming were not new to me, but Java, being an object-oriented language, was new to me. As such the class was new and introduced a lot of concepts which I was not familiar with. This book was good; fairly easy to understand, and the sample problems were good and balanced. I could not find any grammatical, spelling or other mistakes, so kudos to the editors. Overall, it is appropriate for college students and older, though I would not recommend it for high school students learning programming for the first time."
1,Run for your life,"I am currently in the 6th week of my Java class, and I still don't know the difference between a class and an object. This book is a waste of space. Nothing seems to be in the right place nothing is explained well at all. Its so bad that even with some other in my class to explain the concept of Java to me I still am not anywhere near where I should be. AVOID THIS BOOK WITH ALL POSSIBLE MEANS."
2,Confusing,examples are broken up and explanations are bland my teacher in this class is learning it with us and she has no clue its uber confusing but the programs compile good with the compiler we use which is blue j and J creater
2,Don't let the big JAVA 2 on the cover fool you...,"This book's main purpose was to teach the computing concepts using a little bit of Java. Don't plan on learning enough about the Java language itself to make something useful. I was deceived because I saw the words ""Java 2"" on the cover in big print. I guess one really can't blame the author for it because it does say ""Computing Concepts w/ Java2 Essentials."" It was still a disappointment to me since I wanted to learn Java from this book first. Of course, the price of this book is WAY too much for what it teaches. But if you want to learn just Computing Concepts, go ahead and buy it...however, I wouldn't recommend it =P"
2,Overpriced Mediocre Book,"The presentation was very dry, but it's because it's an academic book. Don't expect that because it's Java, a hot IT technology, the book will have a great presentation. Another thing that was frustrating was the way the author smeared problems all over the book and never included solutions to them on the CD - that's useless to me. Overall, it delivered like any other academic book.If you want a better experience learning Java I recommend Wrox's Beginning Java 2 SDK 1.4 Edition, by Ivor Horton. You get more pages, better explanations, wider range of topics, better index... the works. ..."
1,A horrible textbook!,"This text is a nightmare. Terms are poorly defined, if defined at all, and examples are few and far between. The illustrations are laughable. I've seen better graphics in nursery books written 30 years ago. If your professor assigns this text, and you're new to Java, be prepared to shell out more bucks for better sources or cruise the Internet to get the answers you need. This book won't provide them."
2,Buy another book,"This book not about JAVA. It uses JAVA to teach computer concepts. All JAVA explanations and examples very confusing. Author often gives an example, goes through it and declare it wrong in the end, leaving `right' stuff without explanation. Buy other better and cheaper books."
1,This book is Awful!,"This book really has a lot of typos in codes, and some of the classes don't work. The explanation are unclear and non-understandable. It fails to show the connecting of all classses. The whole book is done unorganized."
2,Really Confusing,"I use this text for an AP Computer Science course, and find it to be one of the most confusing books on the topiic of Java and Computer Science. Being in multiple APs, I obvisouly cannot read every single word and frequently have to sort out what information is relevant in a book. In most of my textbooks, this is rather easy. Horstmann's book is, however, quite the exception. The author literally interupts his own sentences and sections with dozens of ""Random facts,"" ""Productivity Hints,"" ""Advanced Topics,"" and many more of these callouts. One chapter, I forget which one, actually has three of these strung in a row, manking this book incredibly hard to read. After cutting out in the middle of a topic, it is very common to just, without warning, start back up five pages later. Avoid this book."
1,An all around bad book,"As a computer science major, I used this book in an introductory programming course. I already had a fair bit of programming experience, although this was my first actual class. This book taught me nothing new about general programming concepts. Such topics are covered equally well or better in dozens of other computer science books (less expensive ones, I might add).However, I was new to Java, so I had hoped that this book would teach it to me. I was disappointed. The book uses its own package of classes which teach the student nothing of real Java. After using this book, I found that I had to start all over again when I wanted to learn Java, and it took me several months to unlearn the material in this book. If you want to learn programming concepts, learn real Java, and save money, then look elsewhere. I would recommend some of the Java titles published by O'Reilly or Sun."
5,MWC STILL GOING STRONG,"This series is one of the funniest shows ever, through season 6, then the quality drops off drastically.Season three has some of the funniest shows so far, and you can't go wrong buying this set. Peggy's bra show, and the dinner show are tops, but all the episodes are very good.The new theme song sounds pretty awful, but maybe that's cause the original theme is so ingrained in our memories.The great thing about DVD's is you can just hit the skip button, and the show begins. This is no reason not to buy this great set.I'm making this short, no need to repeat all the glowing reports, they're all true. I've seen every episode many times, and still laugh. I can't wait for Sam Kinison's Christmas episode in a future release. Enjoy!!!"
3,Great show! Awful music and extra's,"Um, this dvd set only get's 3 stars because of the different theme-song thing. Yes, I'm sorry to say it bother's me immensely. I would have rather heard nothing at all. It ruined the whole experience for me. I never realized how important the theme song was until now. And what's up with the interview excerpts? They are these small snippets that last 2 seconds and because of this you barely get an idea of what the cast is talking about at all. Again, the show in general gets more then 5 stars from me but the set is absolute trash. I think I may sell it and wait for them to re-release it the way it should have been released."
5,One of the best shows ever!!,"I can't tell you how much I love this show. The bundy family is perhaps the greatest sitcom family ever. The jokes are clever and just offensive enough to be perfect. The third season I found is where all of the characters start to come into their own. The relationship between Bud and Kelly really starts to heat up with their bashing of each other. As always Peg and Al are hilarious. Of course Steve and Marcy are the perfect annoying neighbors. If you were a fan of the show this is a great boxset to have, only problem is the lack of the theme song but thats only due to the fact that the people who own the rights to it wanted to much money for them to use it on the boxset. I'm not one for greedy people so I'll let it pass. Chack this Boxset out, it is great!!"
5,The BEST Married... with Children DVD Set!! A++,"I loved this DVD set! The video and sound are MUCH better then the other two sets, the episodes are MUCH funnier, and the cast is doing a great job. Wonderful TV Series, I really don't care about the new opening theme.. I like it! Why wait?? Buy this now! :) Enjoy!"
4,The Greatest Sitcom EVER Made!,"The complete third season is packed with non-stop comedy from all characters and the only reason I give this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the HORRIBLE new theme song added in. I don't know who made that call but it was a pretty stupid one and I just hope that the fourth season and every other season after that sticks with the classic Sinatra theme song. Other than that I would still definatly recommend this dvd as long as you fast forward through the intro, and get ready to bust a gut with all the Bundys :) - - And I recommend #7 The Bald and the Beautiful as the #1 funniest episode on this set. Ed O'Neill is TOO funny!"
3,Video quality is poor,"If you are planning to watch on a big screen, forget it the video quality is poor. it's ok on 27"" TV or smaller screen. or on your PC. I got the whole set 4 seasons. I am planning to watch them on my laptop. since I don't have a dvd player connected to a small tv."
5,The best family!,"""Married... with children"" is my favourite soap opera!Al don't love his children and his women,but they still together like a real family,because they are ""Bundy""-the best family!Kelly is my favourite person of the family.She is not very ""clever"",but that makes herself funny!And Christina Applegate is my favourite actrce!She is so cool!This soap opera has the best actors and the best story!Isn't that cool?!"
4,Finally,"After a 10 month wait, Married... With Children Season 3 will be released on DVD. This is the seasons where the show took the next step up in the comedy scale. This season aired in the 88-89 season and has 22 episodes.Such episodes are when Peggy sees Elvis at Al's Store, when Al owes an overdue library book, and Al and Peg's high school reunion.The only problem is that as of now, the classic theme song, Sinatra's ""Love and Marriage"" will not be used due to the company that owns the rights raising the fee."
3,Video quality poor when shown on a High Definition TV,"I just recently bought a High Definition TV and my collection of other TV show series DVD's looks great, so I when I popped in a MWC DVD I was eagerly expecting a similar sharp looking video picture. Boy, was I disappointed!The video quality of the MWC DVD sets (any of them) was far below that of other DVD series collection such as Friends, Dick Van Dyke, Seinfeld, even Gilligan's Island!The video quality of the Married with Children DVD's looks terrible compared to them. The video quality did not have any of the sharpness or clarity of other similar DVD boxed sets from other companies.If you have a regular TV, then the lack of quality may not be that noticable, but if you ever upgrade to a high def tv, you will definitely see the poor video quality.I loved this show, ranks up there with Friends as one of my favorites, but I am disappointed with the poor video quality of the MWC DVD sets."
1,BAD EXPIRATION,"THIS PRODUCT WAS SENT WITH A SHORT SHELF LIFE AND I FELT IT WAS SNEAKY AND UNDER-HANDED, WON'T PURCHASE FROM THEM EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!"
2,not what i ordered,i ordered a 3.4oz but i got a 1oz.... i will never order anything on amazon if its not sold by amazonWINGS by Giorgio Beverly Hills - After Shave 3.4 oz - Men
3,works ok except in high humidity,"Have used it now for about 2 months.Pros - good price, nice styling.Cons - mine does not work when it rains. Transmitter is about 50 feet away. I hung it outside on a north facing wall under an electrical box, and shielded in a plastic bag with the bottom of the bag open to let in ventilation but keep out the rain. So far it works well in dry and in cold (17degF so far) conditions but temporarily stops transmitting when it rains or drizzles. Another con is that the 3 small windows tend to shade the overhead light from illuminating the 3 LCD displays, so they are a bit hard to read at night."
3,"2nd unit works ok, minor issues","The first unit i received had a garbage display that showed different sections of the LCD display with differing intensities, so bad you could not read it.The second unit works ok, the remote thermometer loses connection from time to time (couple of times a day) and there is an issue with the maximum humidity reseting itself.Other than that this product works fine. Just has the typical cheaply made in China low build quality."
2,"Adequate, but unclear screen","I was considering buying a dehumidifier, because it feels humid inside my apartment during the summer. I bought this first because I wanted to verify whether it actually IS humid in my apartment. Therefore, I have not used the outdoor sensor. Generally it seems to work fine, but the display must be set at the wrong angle, because it is hard to read from straight on. The numbers are most visible if viewed from an angle, so I would not recommend this product."
1,NO batteries included,Wish I could tell you more but it says batteries INCLUDED and you have to buy 5...a little disappointed!
2,barely useful,"Flimsy construction, indoor display is hard to read at most angles, and the remote unit only has a temperature sensor--no hygrometer, which wasn't clear from the product description."
3,Not very accurate,"Well it is kind of an inexpensive device but I see some variation even if you place the outdoors sensor at the receiver base. I thought it had a humidity alarm, but can't get it to work. I prefer Lacrose Technology devices."
4,Excellent book on many different types of spreads.,"This book is the book I have been needing to add to my collection. It has 36 or so different spreads for a multitude of divinations and covers many different areas and questions other books do not. It however does not give an in-depth ""how to"" do a reading or detailed descriptions/meanings of the cards, only a very brief introduction. Based on that, I have to say it is not for beginners. It is best when one has a decent knowledge and familarity with the cards and basic layouts such as the traditional celtic cross. It also gives sample readings of each layout, but I have to say that I do not really look at those, they are just a guideline to how the cards fit that particular spread I suppose, but I like to make my own interpretations and not be influenced by another's style or interpretation. Other than that, it's a good addition to the more experienced reader's library, mine is quite dog-eared!"
2,Not so helpful,"If you want to try new spreads, this book has lots. However, I thought the explanations and uses of the spreads were too specific and not flexible enough. I don't use any of them, because I find these particular spreads confusing and difficult to use. It also gives short and simple meanings for each of the cards, including the numerological, elemental, and astrological associations, which is helpful and convenient, but not detailed enough if you don't have a more comprehensive book or a detailed understanding of the cards. There are better books out there on non-traditional spreads. I only use this one when I need a quick reminder for a card's meaning."
2,Recalled Radio,"I purchased this radio about five years ago. I noticed recently that I wasn't getting any of the S.A.M.E. alerts. I called the company and was informed that WR102 was recalled. To the company's credit, they offered to replace it with a WR601. The current price is about half of what the radio originally cost, so this is a great price but a very bad deal since the radio has problems serious enough to be recalled. Not exactly on the up and up of Amazon and participating companies to keep selling this item."
1,Might be useful as a door stop. Maybe.,"Save your money.Upon receipt, I installed the batteries as instructed. Result: nothing (except to make the unit heavier). That Chinese production reputation for nonexistant quality is again proven.I would recommend that anyone in need of a hazard radio look elsewhere. Too bad I cannot rate this item with -0- stars. I'll never purchase another Oregon Scientific product."
1,unreliable and complicated,"This is a waste of money. It eats batteries. Three AAs last about three weeks. During the last storm, it was useless. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Oregon Scientific WR102 Portable All Hazard Radio,"This purchase was for a second identical unit that I could carry with me during the day. Weather can change rapidly here in Eastern North Carolina. This Oregon Portable Weather Radio has great reviews. I personally give these radios high marks for there service and durability. However, my radio was defective upon arrival. Amazon.com true to their policy shipped me another unit and prepaid for the original unit to be returned to them. I am very pleased with their customer service."
1,Poorly Made,"-Very short battery life (a few days)-No key-lock, so the buttons get pressed if in a bag or on belt (which means you may miss an emergency alert or you may find the batteries dead)-No memory when you replace the batteries (have to re-program and set clock)-Belt clip/holster not strong enough (keeps falling out)-Poor reception (missed alerts)I would not recomend relying on this radio for backpacking or receiving emergency alerts."
1,doesn't work on covered magnetic boards,"These magnets are not strong enough to work on a covered magnetic board (made just for magnets), which was why I bought them."
4,Not what they used to be,"I have been using these sheets for about 3 years now. Highly rated in CR. I just replaced the ones I bought back then and they are not what they used to be. Stitching is not as clean around the seems and the spandex tops and bottoms which I really like are now made with a cheaper material. I called Sealy on this and to there credit they admitted it was true. Still a good sheet for the money, feel comfy and stay on the mattress."
3,Fits great but not very soft,"This is my second set of Sealy Best Fit sheets. The first set I bought was substantially softer and was not sateen. I'm not sure if its the sateen that makes it less soft or what (maybe after a few washes it'll soften up). Aside from the fact that this set is not as soft as I exepcted, everything else is great. I have a very deep mattress (about 20 inches) and this is the only fitted sheet that fits without coming up on the sides. The head and end of the fitted sheet is made of jersey material which allows it to hug around the corners very well to maintain a snug fit. I would recommend the non sateen version of this set if you're looking for great fit and softness."
5,soft and nice!,"i got the purple sheets and love them. They fit perfectly over my King Koil pillow-top, and yes, they are soft. Not the super-softest sheets you can get, like the very expensive ones you can get at Bed Bath and Beyond, but for the price they are quite good. Plus the color is deep and true."
3,Sheets pilling,"I bought these sheets in June (4 months ago), and they have been quite comfortable until now. They are suddenly starting to pill and getting uncomfortable."
3,Decent Sheets,"Decent sheets for the money. I've had trouble with coner slipping off of our super pillow top mattress. Nice color, medium weight, probably wouldn't order again because of corner slippage. They'd definitely be good for a standard pillow top or less."
1,OUCH!,"First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT, unless you love sleeping on the beach with nothing between you and clumpy, gritty sand, don't buy them. After several washings the fabric is truly so rough that it hurts. There is a fatal flaw- the fabric- and the manufacturer must change it if it wants repeat customers. Summary: fit is fantastic, sheets are terrible. Don't buy them."
1,Very Dissappointed!,"I bought these sheets because Consumer Reports rated them very highly. I have only had them for about 2 months and they have gone through about 4 washings. The thread count is suppose to be 330, but you wouldn't know it with the way it ""pills"". I have had 200 thread count sheets that didn't pill. If possible, I will be returning these."
1,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD...","If you're a Bob Hope fan, this movie rates at least 4 stars. Bob Hope was on the top of his game in the 1940's, and this is one of his best. Unfortunately, the movie is practically unwatchable due to one of the worst transfers to disc that you will ever find. The sound and picture quality are bad beyond my ability to describe. Maybe someday they'll get this one right, but stay away from this edition."
1,Keep waiting for a better transfer!,"I love this movie. Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr... what more could you ask for! The version I watched 20 years ago on the late, late show was miles better than this horrible transfer. Since this movie (incredibly) got forgotten by the copyright office and ended up in the Public Domain, all you can find are cheap, HORRIBLE tansfers to DVD's like this god-awful loser. It's better you never even watch this film than to see it in this terribe representation. Why Hollywood wouldn't want to protect gems like these is beyond me, but since they don't give a flying leotard, don't you. This grainy, blurry, audibly incomprehensible, hardly watchable transfer is a complete loser. Don't waste your money. Keep waiting for the ""restored version"" which hopefully comes out before 2021. Cheers."
2,Bad Copy,It is sad when a good film goes bad. (BAD COPY) We were willing to watch Bob Hope on full screen and sacrifice the widescreen experience. Our family had to suffer through rough footage and low sound to watch this film. I stress film. Because of all the lines left from the reel to reel film my husband and I were surprised not hear the sound of a reel to reel projector. I believe we would have enjoyed the movie more if we had watched the movie projected from a reel to reel. The sound was so low we had to turn our sound all the way up. If a better copy can be found we would like to have that one instead of this one.
3,Restoration & Encoding,"If you want to purchase this title on DVD, this is the best one out there right now.That's not saying much however.It looks like they encoded the best 16mm print they could find, but that is not my definition of ""restoration"" in today's marketplace."
3,"Great movie, bad DVD.","A wonderful movie, but the DVD quality is truly bad. First, the opening credits are cut off of both sides! Which means that the scenes are also badly trimmed. Second, the picture quality is faded and grainy. The film splices show and make the picture jump. Third, the sound is horrible, low and fuzzy.Other classic movies from this era which I own are in pristine condition. I can only conclude that the original print was in poor shape and that the transfer to DVD was very poorly done. 5 stars content, 1 star quality: rating 3 stars. This is the version released by Madacy."
4,Entertaining for a period piece,"Easy to judge the movie by contemporary standards. It is no Casa Blanca, but it is fun! Seeing Bob Hope in his early days is always a treat. The quality of the DVD was good, considering the age of the source material."
1,poor show,"This dvd was worse than the ancient Channel 5 (Metromedia) broadcasts of movies on tv in the 1950s and 1960s in New York City.Vertical lines proliferate in the copy, portions of scenes are faded or too dark, etc.I made a mistake in buying this.This was bought at amazon.com"
3,My Favorite Brunette,"Beware!!!! This is one of Bob Hope's best comedy but do NOT buy this version by Alpha Video. Horrible, horrible quality! I dock it 1 star because of that. Get another version & you will enjoy it."
2,Above Average Bob Hope Movie - LOUSY DVD!,"This review refers to the Alpha (Gotham Distribution, as listed on Amazon) version of this movie on DVD. The print used for this DVD is absolutely horrible. The opening credits are barely readable, and the movie itself looks murky and has tons of scratches and dust. It's a shame that Alpha couldn't find a better print, but from some of the reviews I've read it seems that some other companies have had the same problem. It would be better not to release it at all than to use such a bad print. This is a really fun movie, and it deserves a lot better than this. Wait for a cleaner copy to surface - one will eventually."
3,Spoof Noir,"I enjoyed this movie overall. Would I watch it again--not for a while. The sound quality is a bit low, it looks like it could use a bit of remastering visually as well.As far as the actual movie goes--it takes a few moments to get into the plot as it is a framed narrative, most of it taking place in the immediate past getting the viewers up to date with the current situation (Bob Hope in San Quentin). It gets very enjoyable after that, a few confusing moments--a result of a bit of sloppy spoofing. However, mostly it is done very well, anyone familiar with the hard boiled detective genre, film or book will enjoy this for its light hearted take on it.Lamour and Hope play perfectly off each other there is also a nice blink and you miss it cameo by their on the road co-star, Bing Crosby.I really did enjoy this though, but not the very very very best. But quite good."
4,Enjoyable detective spoof with Hope in his usual form.,Bob Hope stars as a wanabe 'hard-boiled' detective who stumbles into a mess of mobsters and mayhem. Hope is in top form with very funny one-liners throughout the film. Character actors Lon Chaney and Peter Lorre provide great screwball villains for the film. Two cameos add icing to the mix (you should be able to guess one of them if you know your Bob Hope films). The quality of the transfer is average and the DVD package is lackluster but the low price makes up for it. Recommended for the family and anyone with a good sense of humor.
5,Bumbling Bob Hope,This is a Bob Hope vehicle film that follows the standard formula of putting him in a series of situations that he is not prepared for and then letting hilarity ensue.In this case Hope dreams of being a detective and gets his chance only to be sucked in deeply out of his depth by - wait for it - a beautiful brunette.Of course he saves the day in the end but not before being put through every possible comedic situation.The sound quality was very high on the disk I bought.
5,The best one yet.,"I've read every single one of Pratchett's Discworld books, most of them more than 2 or 3 times, and I say without a doubt that this is the finest one yet. It seems to me that Pratchett has invested more in Vimes and in Vetinari than in any of his other characters, and it shows. This glimpse into Captain -- sorry, Duke -- Samuel Vimes's past, present, future, and soul simply astounded me. Simply put, I hope to see more Discworld books like this."
4,Not as humorous as previous Pratchett books,"With Terry Pratchett as my favorite author, I really looked forward to Night Watch, especially since out of Pratchett's wide range of characters and character settings, my favorite is about the men, troll, dwarves, werewolf, etc, in the nightwatch division of the police force. It is so easy to escape into a Pratchett book, with the characterizations so well done and the humor intoxicating. I would recommend Jingo, Men at Arms, or Feet of Clay over Night Watch though. It was not as humorous as I would have liked, except for the parts with Nobby Nobbs as a young street urchin. Those parts were excellent! Overall, the book is a good fantasy with Vimes going back in time and seeing things from a slightly differnet perspective than he had experienced them before. Cleverly written, just not quite the caliber of previous books. Still very much worth reading."
1,Great book poorly read.,"While Night Watch is one of the best of the Terry Pratchett novels, this reading of the book is completely disappointing. Although I have read the book with enjoyment many times I can barely tolerate the audio version. The reader's voices and manners are deep and serious with a downturn to their phrasing which is in total contrast to the tone of the book. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the timing of the changes between readers, attempts at british accents are weak and erratic, and the brilliantly written unique characters have no distinction as read. This is especially disappointing because of the excellence of Terry Pratchett novels read by Nigel Planer. I regret purchasing this item."
2,Still better than a lot of books out there!,"Let me say that I love Terry Pratchett, and for over 10 years I've eagerly awaited each new book. I've read some of his early discworld books so many times I've lost count.Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to to really like this book, it was very disappointing. Another reviewer got it in one when they said, ""just not funny"". Yes, all of his books are social satire, but this was verging on just 'social'. Even the jokes that were attempted seemed forced and unoriginal, like I had read them in his other books before. I even read it again (because I always read ever new Pratchett books several times right away since there is normally so much I miss the first time through), but it never 'caught' me, I never laughed, and I just set the book aside.I have been disappointed in the last two Pratchett books, and while I'll be certain to pick up his next book as well, I really hope to see some new, refreshing material in the future."
4,Morality,"Night watch is just my thrid pratchett book after the Science of Discworld 1 and 2, and the Amazing Maurice. As reviewers pointed out the story may not be as hilarious as earlier pratchett books, and this book did not get me laughing many times. What I appreciate about this book the most is not the laughs (there are many other books if you want just brainless comedy), but the fact that this book is trying to present a morality issue about what is bad and right in times of crisis. This is very evident about the decisions Sam Vimes had to take during the revolt. The summing moment to me was when the madam asked Vimes on whose side he was on the revolutionaries or the current patriach. Vimes said neither. I don't know if these morality issues have been touched before in earlier books but I do find that it makes this book worth its salt."
5,Perfect.,"The best Discworld novel I've read to date, and I own them all....and have read most of them three or four times. Consistently funny, as well as emotionally powerful and philosophically both deep and sound (although you can read it as a straight, non-philosophical story, too, if you're tired).Buy this book. Now. You will not regret it."
4,The 'man of the polis' is back...,"Excellent work; tough to put down long enough to sleep; actually rates about a 4.7. I suspect TP was a murder mystery writer in another life. He opens Night Watch well, with a question and a few clues <lilacs?>. Throught the rest of the book he proceeds to allow you to uncover the answer.The technique works for me, although, as in most of his recent books, TP gives in to the temptation to substitute irony for comedy. STILL:Vimes is his usual fuming, funny self, out to keep the peace and everyone's body parts where they belong. I particularly enjoyed Detritus' marching song (true to the troll) in the beginning, though I missed the 'whiz-BANG' of Lady Ramkin's dragons, and Carrot's silly, noble 'dudley doright' attitude."
4,Wow!!! Another hit!,"It's rare that an author can keep writing one series, churning them out at speed, and still keep the novels fresh! Pratchett's secret seems to be that he doesn't spit out novels about the same characters over and over: he has essentially split the Discworld into many almost completely separated series, connected only by cameo appearances of some favorite characters.Night Watch focuses, not surprisingly, on Captain Vimes the Night Watch. This particular story reads much more like a science fiction novel than many of his works, with a pretty common sci-fi theme, but made fresh by Pratchett's perspective.The reuse of such a common theme was why I only rated this a 4, not a 5. However, this book is a great read, totally worth the money, and the time!!!"
4,"A good read, but it's been done before","Overall this is a good book. The characters are interesting, and I definately loved seeing the young versions of some of my old favorites. However, I couldn't help but feel that a lot of this novel was just a rehash of some of Pratchett's earlier works. The whole rebellion thing, for example, is very familiar to the events of ""Men At Arms"" where Carott turns the Watch into a makeshift militia. Still, I enjoyed reading this book, and I would definately recommend it to any fans of the series (like you haven't already pre-ordered it)."
4,Splendid Pratchett,"If you're already a Pratchett fan, this book will give you an opportunity to see some of the most prevalent characters in their younger years, something I found delightful. If you're new, this book is a great way to get hooked, as it supplies enough basic information about the previous books that one can keep up.My favorite set of characters is the Watch, so reading about the city in its more corrupted days, when Vetinari and Vimes were very young man, is grand.I read this book in one sitting."
4,Very entertaining,"I was unfamiliar with the author or the ""Discworld"" universe, but this was a very good book in and of itself. The characters are intriguing and there are a few twists that keep you coming back. Pratchett mixes serious situations with humor and the result is very entertaining."
3,a bit more serious,This book is more on the serious side of Pratchettt yet it still has the wit and the charm of all the other books. Let the adventure begin
4,Removing the Mask: Giftedness in poverty,This book is insightful about the community of learners who are often overlooked as gifted and talented. The book gives an analysis of a diverse group of students.I had several aha moments while reading this book.
1,Perfect for the narcissistic woman's needs,"For the last five years I've been well acquainted with a middle aged couple, where the wife has read, and been determined to put into practice all of the suggestions in this horrible book. The husband is a very kind hearted person, who has always been one to pull his own weight, with the children, household chores, shopping, etc. But, no, that wasn't enough for her. The wife runs her own business, and has decided that he needs to buck up and do more. While she sits on the phone with her clients, he has to jerk around his own office schedule to meet her needs. I have seen him go from a pleasant, smiling person to a sad, exhausted, numbed robot. His wife has zero empathy for his needs, or those of anyone else, for that matter. But this book will probably sell well, as our society becomes more and more narcissistic. Sad."
3,New Age Dominance?,"This book is interesting. The author's personal tale of her life journey is much more fascinanting than the description of the different types of women and how this affects their abilities to lead those around them. I did find some useful ideas; however there is a chapter in the book about the men's perspective that does not give the first person account but rather a generalization. I would have preferred to read what drew a man to the powerful woman (or women) in his life. Maybe the author, Barbara Wright Abernathy, will one day write a follow-up......"
4,A cordless phone for most everyone,"This is a very easy to use and very high quality cordless phone. The headset is comfortable, lightweight, and the sound quality is excellent. The memory, caller-ID, and call-back functions are all user friendly. Drawbacks to this phone revolve around the inabilty to use it (i.e. like a speakerphone) when it sits in its cradle. Another negative is the clip on the back of the phone is flimsy and the unit can slip from a pocket or belt. These minor flaws should not deter you from buying this otherwise terrific phone especially at its very competitive price."
1,The worst design of a phone,I got this phone thinking that the name brand would stand for quality but it completely did not. The replacement cost me lots of shipping cost and did not even been to work. My advice it see this model do not buy unless you like pain and suffering with big cost for a truly inferior product. Clearly IBM does not care about their customer base. Their service after the sale is extremely bad. Their design on this phone was so poor that the phone only almost worked for 1 day.
2,Very Basic...,"This book is excellent for someone who is just starting the hobby of archery and who has not yet learned ANYTHING about different types of bows, arrows, and shooting stances. The authors have done a very good job of making the fundamental concepts of archery easy to understand for someone who has never dealt with them. For anyone else involved in the hobby, this book is very basic and is probably below your level of skill."
3,TOO SMALL,"We bought this playhouse for our daughter's 2nd B-day. First of all, let me say it is a beautiful playhouse! The door-bell doesn't ring loudly and the play phone rings the same way. It was very easy to build, but it took two people, for holding purposes. The front porch is very roomy but as you enter into the house it's VERY SMALL inside, 30 1/2 wide by 41 1/2 long!!!Overall, the house is quite large appearing as you view from the outside. The inside is LITTLE. I really can't see two children being able to play in the house part without knocking into each other. I really liked the porch idea but i just didn't realize that it took away sooo much inside the house section. I really like Step2 and we have several of their products but this one will have to go back. Sorry Step2!"
3,BIG price BIG disapointment,We just bought this playhouse for our 3 year old daughter. It is very cute however it is VERY small inside. I don't think more than one child can fit inside at one time. In fact we had to take out the shelf and the sink just to make enought room to move around. If the toy r us store had not had to take it out of the box to fit it in our SUV we would definatly be taking this back. I am very disapointed at the size for $300.00. Think twice before buying this playhouse!
4,I Coulda Been Your Cellmate!,Monique is great as always! I loved her though in Phat Girlz best though! She really shined in that movie!!!
3,A Feminist Examination Of Mae West,"Kathleen Rowe's ""The Unruly Woman: Gender and the Genres or Laughter,"" published in 1995 is a university press publication that examines Mae West's contributions to the Feminist Movement and evaluates her role as a female icon of the twentieth century. This treatment of West is a typical academic text with good research of textual sources, but with little or no interviews and featuring theory that is hit or miss.When Mae West was asked why she never wrote an article supporting the Feminist Movement she reportably drawled, ""I was nevah asked....."""
4,A trip down memory lane...,"My wife and I have been loving perusing Kim Casali's cartoons...we both remember them from the 70s and each one makes us smile.My only complaint is the thin paper, but for the price, one can't really complain."
3,"Tiny, tiny book!","Just so you know, this is a small book (even in hardcover), fits in the palm of one's hand. Pages wise, its also sparse. The kind of thing you'd put in a stocking, or attach to a bunch of roses. Otherwise, cute with the regular cartoons."
5,Love isn't easily explained,"How do you explain love and many forms of love to a child? This book is helpful in that regard because it explains, simply, how one can demonstrate love rather than saying ""I love you."" It helps children connect the many acts of kindness to being loved. This book provided an easy to understand set of thoughts on how love is shown and what to look for."
5,great hair spray,"this hairspray holds really good and you can style with it also. helps with the styling with you hair, you will like it"
2,There's no light in the display! a big negative,"It does pretty much everything that I was looking for Except!The display is not easily visible, there is no backlight, so in dim light or at night you can't see who is calling or any of the time data.Also, maybe I haven't found the right button, but it doesn't seem to hand up after a call unless you replace the phone in the cradle.They should make a cordless version & light the display."
3,Clock light needed.,"Phone, radio, caller ID, and clock work very well and is very attractive. My wife is very pleased with the design, however, we miss the lighted clock which our previous like-item had. It sits on our night stand next to our bed and a lighted clock is very important to us. To solve this problem I will have to buy a separate lighted clock for the bedroom. Since we have had the item for only 3 days I don't feel qualified to rate it hight than a 3 at this time. Any comment regarding this matter? Regards - CEP"
1,Do not buy a northwestern bell phone,I had my last phone for 40 years and due to remodling I purchased a NWB phone and it lasted 5 months. You can't get through to their help line most of the time and twice I left my phone number to receive a call back and received none. They do not answer their e-mail either. These pnones are junk. BEWARE!
3,Can't see the time in the dark!,"Phone looks good and works well, but one major feature is missing! There is no backlit display! You can't see the time or the caller ID in the dark. I'm sending it back."
1,Broken Bottle,"Ordered this set for my grandma, it showed up 3 days before christmas and the main perfume bottle was cracked and had leaked every where.Wouldnt recommend buying from the seller, should have just went to jcpenny in the first place."
1,Too strong,I love the powder so I ordered the set. The lotion is so strong. After washing my hands a few times you can still smell it. The perfume is way too strong. I do not like it. Still love the powder!!!!
2,This lipstick is orange-red. Very bright,I thought it would be a strong red color but its super bright orangey red. I use it as a stain. I would not purchase it again.
4,Great product,"This does what the big 4-5 dollar stones u might find locally. I give it good ratings on oxygen amount, size, and price. A little brittle I dropped one barely and it quickly broke so their not as tough as ur large stones but they perform as well just require more care"
1,What has happened to changeling?,"Another inferior product for changeling from white wolf, this one is supposed to be a guide to the ""war of concordia"" but all it contains are the reactions of the kith and assorted houses, a few new art's,weapons,and treasures. It never really states how changelings make war in the 20th century. Things like tactics, what happen's when ordinary people happen across the rather large battle's are all glossed over if they are mentioned at all. One thing I have held that was unbeleiveable about the world of darkness is how people could remain ignorant about the vampires, changelings, wraiths, werefish ,ect around them when there are constantly large to small scale conflicts going on all around them. This book has no information on that or on the war in concordia in any meaningful way so I can't recomend it."
1,tv doesn't work,"the kreisen 37"" flat screen tv arrived. plugged it in, doesn't work. buyer beware, amazon does not accept returns of televisions over 27"". had to wait over 2 days for a reply to our numerous phone calls to kreisen, television was shipped back to them. we still have not recieved a working television."
4,Workbook,This item was purchased for my grandson....Seems the school didn't have enough books to go around so I ordered this for him from Amazon.com...Timely delivery and in better condition than advertized...
4,Video below standard,"Although the video left a lot to be desired, the plot is a true reproduction of the book, which remains one of the best novels I ever read. This is a very hard item to procure, and I am grateful to the people who have made it available."
5,CHIEFS,"Like others, I taped the miniseries CHIEFS when first broadcast and have enjoyed watching it ever since; in fact, last year I burned a copy of my worn old VHS tape into disc since it appears it won't be released anytime soon in region 1. I would suspect there is a contractual reason [perhaps Heston himself? I understand he always thought he gave one of his best performances in the flm...] it has not yet been released.CHIEFS is one of those rare films whose story not only spans decades- but which laso stands up well even today with its topical subject matter."
3,Don't buy it,Video is very blurry it is obviously pirated!!!!! Don't buy it. I wasted 20 bucks should have waited for real DVD to come out.
2,"""Chiefs"" DVD","The seller was upset that I gave a negative review. I, as the consumer, was upset that the product was not as advertised. I cannot with a clear conscience give a better review. When someone sells something I expect that it is in working order as advertised. He should have inspected it to make sure it was not defective. The DVD did not play on my player or on my computer. I wanted so badly for it to play that I gave it every effort. The picture was not clear and my computer said the DVD was damaged/defective."
2,chiefs mini series,This movie is poor quality on VHS tape. I watched it years ago on TV. They left out some parts of the show.
2,Chiefs,I got a VHScopy that did not work on my video player.I was able to return to the sender.I would have liked to get the new DVD copy but found it too costly.It was a good tv series and book and Isaw it quite a long time ago.It's to bad that the cost is high.Ron
5,Chiefs,"I first saw this movie when I was a teenager. My mother recorded it onto a VHS tape. I still have this old tape. I pull it out at least twice a year to watch it. If you want to see a good movie, watch the movie ""Chiefs"". I will be happy when and if it becomes available on DVD, so I could finally dump the old VHS tape!!!!! This movie covers so many topics. The reality of racism is explored over the course of several generations and the fact that evil can come from places people least expect are just a few of the subjects covered in this movie. ""Chiefs"" just gripped me from the beginning. Excellent movie!!! POWERFUL!"
5,Three police chiefs in a small Georgia town,"As well as two generations of a Georgia family in service to the people. The first is Will Henry Lee, the town's very first police officer. Then comes his son Billy, who goes into politics (another film, ""Roots"", deals with yet a third generation in public service, Billy's son Will). The entire saga is Southern life in all its glory--prejudice, ambition and passion. Stuart Woods, who wrote the novels this miniseries and the other film are based on, shares only with Pat Conroy the title of ""The Faulkner Of Our Times"". If I were you, I'd get the other film as well--and both books!"
1,Pay attention to what you are ordering...,"I wasn't able to play this because it was for region 2. I didn't notice this when I ordered it, my fault. Now I'm stuck with a $30 item and can't return it because I opened it."
1,A waste of time and $,Quality of DVD was awful..it was blurry and the sound was off. For 25.00 I expected some degree of quality and there was NONE. The cover wasn't even well done. It was advertised as the original version of Chiefs but it looked more like someone taped the tv screen while the old VHS copy was playing. A huge disappointment.
1,Copy of a copy,"This was definitely NOT worth $25. I could have made a better copy off my DVR. What a waste of money, time, and effort."
1,Bad Chop Job,"""Chiefs"" is a made for TV mini series that runs about 4-1/2 hours without commercials. I was hoping to replace my damaged VHS tape copy with a DVD copy. I was greatly disappointed in this copy as it is badly butchered. Not only was it cut down with many segments chopped or eliminated, the editing was a horrible job. It's as though a 5 year old with scissors was turned loose. There are cuts in the middle of scenes, one even in the middle of a conversation. Portions were removed such that some of the subsequent story made no sense, or did not portray the same message as would have come across if the film had been left in its original length.PS if anyone knows of a full length copy out there I'd love to hear about it."
2,Chiefs,"This two disc production is a very poor quality copy. It does not appear to be produced by the studio. Although it contains the FBI warning on unauthorized copying, this production appears to be exactly that. I would think the MPAA would want to look into this supplier. And, I am surprised this product was offered on Amazon."
4,It doesn't get any better....,"I've searched high and low for this movie for 12 years, and then one day I finally found it and ordered it. I'll treasure this movie for a lifetime, I'm soooo happy to have it in my movie collection. This is one movie I'll never depart with. I first saw this movie as a teenager in ""83"" and loved it. I didn't see it air on television anymore after ""83"" and have thought about it often over the years and wished I had recorded it back then. After 12 years of searching, I don't have to search no more. This movie is definitely a must see and have, once you have it, you'll be glad you own it."
3,Sometimes you just can't win,"I won't comment too much on the movie - I remembered it well from it's original showing on TV, and glad to get a DVD copy - but oh my goodness, the quality....First attempt, I purchased the German 4-disk release which required a Region Free player, no problem. I wss looking forward to seeing the complete series. The quality was great if you speak German, but I don't. The English audio track is such a poor quality that I gave up after the 1st espicode.Second attempt, I purchased a 2-disk, Region 1 which was ""remastered"" from a VHS tape. In the case, the quality is very good (considering the source), but it is obviously heavily edited. Oh, well - here's hoping a good complete version is released someday."
1,Poor Qality,"First of all the discs are copies, not originals. The sound cuts in and out and the picture is grainy looking. I am unable to watch it and I did not get a packing slip in the box with the DVD, so I guess I can't return it."
2,Chiefs DVD,I enjoyed the mini series but the quality of the DVD was poor at best. The picture quality was faded and looked like it was made using a video camera recording a TV progeram.The DVD was actually scratched and at one pont in the movie stopped playing. I had to skip ahead to the next chapter to continue watching.
3,Finally found it!,"I was very excited about finding a new copy of the mini-series, Chiefs. I searched for what seems like years! I wasn't disappointed in the service or condition of the product. The sound and video wasn't as crisp as it could have been...but, it wasn't bad either. (I expected it wouldn't be dead-on given it was a reproduction.)No complaints. I'd order from this supplier again."
2,A 1983 made for tv classic,"The film quality was poor. As was the sound. Too much for this bootleg. Also, I noticed some scenes were omitted from it."
1,POOR QUALITY!,"I bought this to replace my old vhs copy, it was as bad as my old copy it looked like they took an old vhs and copied it.DON'T BUY IT"
4,If you liked the series - then you will enjoy the book,Mine came with 4 disc's - the 4th disc is actually the 1st disc - only remastered. (they must have found a better way to improve the quality of the sound - and the distributor was Gracious enough to include it).Wish that they could have improved the qualtity of the sound on the 3rd disc as well.Other than that MINOR aggrivation - I really enjoyed it all over again
2,Video and Audio Terrible,Chiefs is one of my all time favorites but the DVD I received had subpar Video and Audio. It appeared to be captured from an old VHS tape and I was unable to watch more than a few minutes of it. I was extremely disappointed with the product. There was a disclaimer in the product description but nothing to prepare me for the terrible quality of the video/audio. I returned it.
1,Horrible,The case was broken when it came. It was obviously copied off something like youtube or a bad quality vas tape. Parts had been edited out and it was not what I have come to expect from Amazon. I had no idea that it wasn't a legitimate product.
2,Do not purchase Chiefs in DVD,"This DVD set is terrible quality. I have waited years for ""Chiefs"" to come out on DVD. I finally received an email from Amazon that it's available. I ordered it right away. We received it today and started to watch it for New years eve. We are very upset at the cheap homemade packaging and the printing on the discs.These are obviously home made and I feel cheated. The color is terrible and just not a clear picture.Very disappointed that Amazon would be involved in this. This is a cheap copy off a VHS. I gave them 2 stars because it shipped quickly."
2,"if your THAT naive, read this book",I was in real need of some guidance and this book was rated high in a local parenting mag so I picked it up looking forward to reading someone's expert advice. But instead I felt like I was listening to a cheerleader give me advice. Enough already with the exclamation points. I get the basic premise. What I was hoping for was something more substantial backed up with facts and studies. If you have little emotional intelligence you will probably get something out of this book... i have an iota more than a little and found this book ridiculously simplistic.
2,Vague advice,"I bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage. I expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom. However, I found the book very frustrating: 1)the testimonials all came from women who were dissatisfied with their relationships, neglecting those who developed strong bonds with stepchildren; 2)the advice is all too vague to be applied. Chapters titled, ""Simplify Expectations"" and ""Simplify Relationships"" are filled with generalizations that are about as effective as telling an over-stressed mom to ""just relax"". Overall, a disappointing read."
1,Are you kidding?,Here is my review.You would have to be mentally ill to pay $12.00 for a book you can download for free.This book would have to be capable of doing my taxes for the asking price.
1,A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,"I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time."
4,enjoyable also in the 21th century,"A classic read, a man from the modern age is displaced in time winding up in Camelot.Mark Twain makes plenty of fun of chivalry and middle-age wizardry.The book first appeared in 1889, but it's an entertaining read today. The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely ""entertainment"" perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."
5,A Connecticutt Yankee in King Arthur's Court,Mark Twain really tears apart the Catholic church and nobility. He also points out how the tyranny of England in Arthur's time continued on 1300 years later. The book will make you laugh and will also make you examine the myths that people take as fact today
4,One of the better books I have read.,"I found this book to be an excellent work. One man with everyday knowledge and a little ingenuity can attain a position of power over a 6th century kingdom. I liked this book because it presented me with a challenge. Trying to figure out Twain's manerisms and 6th century ettiquette made this this book a little confusing at times, but at the same time it captured my interest. I just couldn't put it down until I had finished it . When I did finish it I ended up going back and re-reading parts to ensure a clear understanding of what was happening."
3,An interesting mix of truth and what could have truly been.,"""The book was an interesting insight into a man who finds power in another time and eventually falls to a graeter power. It gave interesting ideas and showed the foolishness of the knights in the famed 'Camelot.' I loved it."""
3,A good book,"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period. He is faced with a lot of these incidents like going to war.It takes place in the nine tenth century in Camelot. I found this book to be a good one because Mark Twain does a great job of putting a picture of what of what the main character is seeing and exepriencing. The details ore so well put that you can almost believe you were their. Also, the way the characters talk and the dialogue is so fitting to the character.Finally, I would recommend this book to teens because a child wouldn&#65533;t get it and I think an adult wouldn&#65533;t be interested. I hope my review has been useful to you."
5,A Favorite revisited,"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again. Mark Twain is a master story teller. I enjoyed it again,40 years later."
3,It's Okay,"Fanciful. Like I have said before, it is an example of the diversity of Mark Twain's many interests and his imagination."
5,Very funny!,This book is still hilarious. I reread it for the first time since high school. I don't know how much of the political and human satire I understood then; I hope it was a lot. Now it's much richer. The description of riding in the countryside in full armor is a peach!
4,A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,"A ""must read"" for my son's Honors English class! I love it as a classic - he enjoyed it as a classic cross between his love for scy-fi and medieval stories. I'm glad it was available on Kindle for his last-minute reading."
4,A subtle satire of epic proportions!,"I'm only 14 years old, but I finished reading this book for my 8th grade English class about a week ago. The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."
4,Great Reading,"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."
3,Entertaining,"This is the first book by Twain I've read. I have had a love affair with England and her history, and this take on the Arthurian legends was definitely interesting and cleverly written."
3,Classic Shows It's Age,Premise is interesting but becomes tedious over the telling. Almost like a movie script.I remember enjoying it a lot more when I was twelve.
2,Not a story for true King Arthor fans.,"I am a true fan of the King Arthor legands and of the writings of Mark Twain, but this novel does not meet up to either things. Basically the writing is not as well done as his other stories like Tom Sawyer and it puts down the whole legand of the Round Table. If you are inclined to be romantic about the Arturian period definitly do not read this story. I wish that I could have enjoyed this more, but there was little to make me love it"
2,"Promising premise, disappointing and remarkably dour delivery","Twain spoils a promising premise with bloated preachifying, colorless prose, and an uneven, nigh-absurdist plot arc."
4,Reviewed by a Connecticut Yankee,"You probably already know the basic setup: a man from 19th Century Connecticut goes back in time to King Arthur's England. The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."
2,It's a Mark Twain classic... but I couldn't say why.,"Mark Twain is, of course, a famous writer and a producer of a number of US classics. But this one is just too much of Mark Twain trying to make nasty remarks in order to be a cynic and too much of pushing American chauvinism, against too little realism to be bearable. Fine, 19th century Americans (and 20th and 21st as well) believe as a religion that their republic was the best invention since sliced bread and every other country in the history of the world was a land of morons. But this story depends on some far-fetched underestimation of human beings (or overestimation of Americans in relation to all others) in combination with sweeping generalizations and a lot of sweeping history under the rug.In short, I didn't like it."
1,sucky book,this book sucks no one should ever read i hated it so bad that i want to throw it away never ever read it
5,This book is an onion...more and more layers,"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."
4,"Anyone who loves Twain, history, or humor would enjoy this.","Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."
2,Wasn't MY kind of book,This book was a required reading for my school for summer. I did not enjoy the book in some parts because I found it to be very confusing and boring. There were some chapters that I found interesting and suspenseful. I would not recommend this book for readers. I think it just gets boring after awhile.
2,Not Twain's best,"I had to read this book for a college class, I thought it was one of Twain's worst, and that comes from someone who loves many of Twain's other works. In fact for my essay I compared this work to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain uses the dialect of the people in King Arthur's time, and sometimes it can get very confusing. I skipped over several paragraphs just because I couldn't make any sense of it. As long as Twain isn't using the dialect of that time the story line is very good. I found it annoying how Twain over played the stupidity of people of King Arthur's time."
3,Very difficult to read,"I read this book, expecting it to be similar to Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. However, I struggled through the old English monologues of some of the characters. While this is an amusing tale of a 19th century American attempting to modernize 6th century Britain, I wish I had applied my recreational reading time elsewhere.This paperback printing is difficult to read, too. The words run too close to the spine, requiring me to hold the book flat to read."
5,Funny yet profound,"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."
3,didn't really make it,"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"
5,A often misunderstood satire.,"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."
4,"Confusing, but also fun","In A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, a conecticut from the 19th centuries brings modernization into the 5-6th century and seems to change the world at that time. He is named the Boss after making amazing feats and everyone becomes scared of him and in awe. he puts Merlin the magician into shame and the Boss becomes the famous minister of king Arthur and the magician everyone is scared of. Yet, Hank( the connecticut's real name) is not a real magician. He uses his knowledge of the earths reaction and science of the 19 century to perform what seem like miracle and magic to the people of the 5 and 6th century.Hank goes through many things in the 5th century. In the end, all of britain goes against him and 53 other people, but he prevails using his knowledge and cunning. He sleeps for 16 centuries until the time comes for him to wake up and be in his own time again."
3,Not the best he's done,The conclusion is a bit weird .. with some psycho-babble which I found strange and disappointing.
3,"Fun, classic noir","Noir detective fiction - this is nearly a perfect example a paragon, of the genre. It's worth reading just to see what so many movies and cartoons satirize - other than that, this book has a few quotable lines, and is fun."
4,Trustworthy,"The seller sent me the DVD a bit late (I feel that way, at least, but it could have been the Post Office's fault, of course), but the actual DVD was in perfect condition. I am very satisfied with the product and wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
5,Simply the Little Einsteins!,"I bought it because my daughter was going for vacations with her grandparents in Costa Rica, and she loves the Little Einsteins. I watched it with her before traveling and she loved it, as every time she watches the show. I am now happy that she will get entertained during the rainy afternoons."
1,Need something to light a fire? Here you go...,"I gave this one star, because negative stars are not allowed. The previous review has to have been written by someone closely related to the book.I was a teen-ager during the '80s Ninja Craze and even then, this book would have been seen as a complete joke. I think I was expecting a Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon to turn up somewhere in the book, but was disappointed to not see one.Bottom-line - Stay away from this book. If you are really interested in something about ninja, look into Stephen K. Hayes."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I bought this Toshiba DVD Player (3750) seven months ago and now it will not turn on. Of course this is conveniant for Toshiba since it has a 3-month labor warranty and 1-year parts warranty. The local authorized repair shop says labor will cost ... (adds up to the cost of a new dvd-player). So this TOSHIBA dvd player will be going straight to the TRASH and I hope to find a different brand dvd player with a longer warranty.Until then I will suffer with my VCR.P.S. This dvd player had a great picture and sound until it broke.
4,"Everything great, but glitches with mp3 playback","Love the player, but the mp3 playback seems buggy... I did an experiment using a single test song on various CD-R/CD-RWs burned at different speeds, using different mp3 encoders at differing bitrates (128-256k), stereo modes, etc., but every one played with loud pops and warbles throughout the song. They're so loud they're impossible to ignore. The defects are in different places during the test song, so I'm not sure what's causing it (disc surface, encoding, decoding???).Anyone have any tips? (I read somewhere that gold media worked better than blue-green, but where do I find gold media? You can't tell by the packaging what color the media is...)TIA."
2,Disappointing DVD Player,"I purchased this player about five months ago. Recently while playing a flawless DVD, the picture froze up while audio continued to play. Powering down the player and restarting it solved the problem. MP3 playback is a problem on this unit also. The instructions include a nice ""disclaimer"" about how certain types of MP3 media may not work. All MP3 media sounds terrible on this machine. Playback is interrupted by ""pops"" and ""chirps"". MP3 discs also cause the unit to freeze and not advance to the next song (though you can advance it manually by pressing the skip button).Picture playback is good and the unit has many features not found on other players, such as screen capture (allows you to use a scene from a DVD and select it as ""Wallpaper"" for your TV) and zoom capabilities.I have not utilized the player's progressive scan output yet."
2,Sub-par progressive scan player...,"You should realize initially that progressive scan dvd players will have a better picture, even if you don't own a HDTV. So the picture and audio quality were a nice improvement when I first got this player...and at a great price. However, it does not age well at all. I've had it a little over the year, and the freezes when it switches layers (many movies use 2 layers of the DVD disk) are becoming more pronouced. It is becoming more frequent that you cannot see the dot or highlight that lets you know what you are selecting (you can select, but it becomes a guessing game) until you power down, eject the disk, and start all over again. Finally, it is starting to completely freeze...and I mean completely (you can't even power down from the front buttons, you have to pull the cord at the back). Don't waste your money."
4,"Awesome Movie Experience, Mp3 needs minor improvements...","First of all, I'd like to start by saying that this DVD player does a awesome job on playing DVD Movies! Picture and sound are excellent....For the 4-stars :I took away 2 stars because my primary use of this machine was MP3 playback.....There are lots of improvement to be made in the MP3 portion of this machine::Positive : 1.Attractive on-screen mp3 layout2. Program, Repeat and Random features...Negative : 1. On-screen display only shows the first 8 characters of the song filename. (Which sux!)2. No fast forward or rewind during MP3 playback...Which is insanely disturbing to me...3. The player has problems playing CD-RW discs. I regularly hear pops, clicks and zips during playback. Im not sure if this is only on CD-RW discs...That's it!!If you'r an audiophile like me and into MP3....You might turn your head towards the JVC XV-S60BK.But if your into mostly watching movies....GO FOR IT!!!"
3,Remote [is awful],"The remote control on Toshiba SD3750 [is awful].First of all the remote does not control tv(volume, channel etc). For the price the remote should have been a universal one. Anyway who wants to watch a DVD and not control the TV. Also the LED that transmits the IR from remote to TV is visible. There is no cover so it looks ugly and in future break if you drop it on the floor.Second of all the on screen menu is slow and very confusing and pain to go through. However one good thing is that while you are traversing the menu, you can continue to watch the DVD and the menu items move to the sides."
2,Lots of Problems - Avoid,"I had high hopes for this unit given what we paid for it, but have had MANY problems. About half the DVDs we have played in it have had serious sound problems, as if you were turning the volume up and down randomly. It makes many movies unwatchable. Plus, you get plenty of picture freezes. Most cdr/mp3s that we have tried in it also had serious audio problems, lots of pops and the like. These cdr/mp3s play fine on other players.I've had lots of problems with other Toshiba products lately, so my advice would be to avoid them."
5,Looking forward to getting this DVD Player!,"Hey guys, why are you ragging about a DVD player that isn't even out yet? You are supposed to be rating the player on this page. Your poor reviews for another DVD player has given this one a low rating. Next time rag somewhere else! I ordered this player based on Toshiba's reputation and all the state of the art features it offers. I'm very optimistic that it will be the right DVD player for me."
1,Toshiba: ignorant and slow,"I have to agree with the other reviewer. This supposedly forthcoming model isn't even listed on the Toshiba Web site. Furthermore, the SD 4700 JUST APPEARED. This model was announced almost a year ago, and still isn't available. First it was due in June, then July, and I still challenge you to find a dealer that actually has it.It's too bad that Toshiba is failing so pitifully in bringing these seemingly good products to market. These players do supposedly have the essential features: CD-R playback, progressive scan, DVD-Audio, and all the necessary outputs. And the prices are good. But that's irrelevant when you can't buy the products."
3,Pretty neat.....,"The quality of the video is not great, but this is nonetheless video of the original lineup of Flipper. Outside of the other Target videos, the film studio VHS, and scenes from EMERALD CITIES, seeing the original band on film is hard to come by. This DVD remedies that and makes available Flipper in the DVD format for the first time. Flipper opens for Throbbing Gristle at this venue. You see Genesis P. Orridge once in the video, which is cool in itself. The performace of Flipper is stunning. Powerful, out of tune, and HEAVY. Some rare songs and some of the ""hits."" If you are a fan, you'll love it and you'll know that you are holding history in your hands. Hopefully a few Flipper converts will come from the availablilty of this DVD, too. But, alas, like so much other cool music, this will fall through the cracks in the clamor for Journey, Eddie Money, the Little River Band, and their modern equivalents. Sad."
3,Not needed if you get the Paris Guide book,"While this is helpful, it is not a necessary purchase if you purchase the 2008 Paris Guide by Rick Steves. But it is a fun and entertaining read!"
4,"Easy To Use, Will Be Helpful",So far this book seems easy to use. Has all the basics and some extras that are funny. Look forward to useing it when we go to France in Sept.
5,The only phrase book you'll need,"I had two phrase books during my recent two-week visit to France and found that I really only used this one (and the Marling Menu Master). Common situations are covered extremely well and are easy to locate in the book. For example, if I needed to ask if a train was direct or was leaving from a certain track, the book easily allowed me to figure out how to say it. One night, I got locked out of a hotel (they locked the doors before 10!) and I was able to use the book to explain my predicament over the phone. The size is perfect too as it fit in the back pocket of my slacks. Rick Steve's books are great and this one is no exception."
3,ok,the number of times i referred to the book and the word or phrase was not listed vastly outnumbered the number of times i successfully found the word or phrase. We much preferred the Lonely Planet phrase book.
5,Rick Steves' French Phrase Book and Dictionary,The book was delivered on time and in the condition promised. I expect it will be a handy reference while on vacation in France the way previous Rick Steves books have been while traveling in other countries.
1,Hard to use,"I would not recommend this phrase book because I found it very hard to access the phrases. It is organized by situations where you would use the phrases, such as counting, traveling, eating, and sleeping. It requires too much skimming and scanning to find what you want to say."
3,Dissappointed,This book is way overpriced for the lack of content. It is hard to translate even with the book. Leaves alot to be desired. Sorry about the pun!!
1,Idiosyncratic Book,Just returned from Madagascar where French is commonly used. I speak some French but I wanted a small dictionary and phrase book. This book is certainly small but over half of the simplest words I looked up were not there whereas obscure words were. Buy a small pocket dictionary instead. It will be far more useful than this idiosyncratic book.
5,Great little backpack book,We used this mostly for the menu decoder. There was a surprise moment when we used it for the medical description at a pharmacy. This book paid for itself there!
4,Interesting,"Secret World Live has more interesting elements then Plays Live musically. Rather then just keyboards, bass, stick, guitar, drums and percussion theres violin, doudouk, harmonica and a strong female vocalist. The playing and singing are great on many along with the song selection (Red Rain substitutes for San Jacinto). The only drawback is that some of the tracks work better visually and musically then just musically."
4,Better than a Best Of,"Many musicians and bands like to put out a ""best of"" CD that features hits over a certain time period. Peter Gabriel has the fortunate problem, however, of being so remarkably prolific in his career from Genesis to his solo work that it would be impossible to do this.Secret World's live album can't hope to be enough in only two CDs - but it does all it can to show any fan the beauty of Gabriel's music. More than this, it also shows how passionate and captivating his concerts are. It made me wish that I could have seen him at one of these concerts. The pictures in the CD sleeve also indicate a concert of beautiful props and great artistic expression.With the wonderful opening of ""Talk to Me"" to the wonderful extended anthemic ""In Your Eyes"" the listener is given great insight to the essence of Gabriel's work.I may have given this a full 5 stars, but Biko MUST be in any good listing of Peter Gabriel's work. Such a powerful wonderful song leaves just a little bit of a vacuum."
4,"Not quite live, but it will have to do.","Peter Gabriel is an outstanding live performer and this concert recording makes a valiant attempt to capture the emotion brought forth by a Gabriel performance. A solid list of great songs and true concert recordings help, but the element of joy that is found in Gabriel's live performances is missing. This album gives an approximation of what a Gabriel concert is like but misses the immediacy and power of the performance. The material and performances are excellent; it just can't quite truly recreate the experience. For alternate versions of many of Gabriel's best songs; however, it can't be left out of any fan's collection."
5,Get plays live instead.,"This set is a must for any fan, but it palls incomparason to ""plays live"". As someone who has seen Peter in clubs as well as arenas I can say that this set could be better. The concerts themselves were excellent, but the CD was not. For my money, if you are going to buy onr PG CD buy ""Plays Live"" it is a much more representative collection of Peter's live talents than this mundane set."
4,A Peter Gabriel Guilty Pleasure?,"If I force myself into objectivity, there's quite a bit I can say against this album. Although obviously a live album, it sound studio tweaked into shape (much more so than PLAYS LIVE). ""Sledgehammer"" suffers from pre-programmed horn ( and probably flute) tracks. Paula Cole's backing vocals at times compete with Peter's rather than complement them. I especially found her part on ""Don't Give Up"" to be too...well, too darn strong - Kate Bush's delicate wavering voice on the original matched the material much better. The only track repeated here from PLAYS LIVE (""Solsbury Hill"") doesn't sound as good. And I didn't really need a full eleven minutes of ""In Your Eyes"", a song I never cared too much for. And yet...and yet...and yet I actually enjoy the thing when I put it on. I wish I had seen the show - it still sounds very enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend this to PG neophytes (check out SO or PETER GABRIEL III instead) but this one won't disappoint most PG fans."
3,"Not bad, but . . .","I am a Peter Gabriel fan, and I own every album he has put out; but this is the one that gathers the most dust. I would recommend listening to Plays Live for a live PG fix."
4,Gabriel Takes Us to a Live Experience.,"I cannot deny that Peter Gabriel is my musical hero, along with Bjork (Well, she is two steps behind him). But I will try to be as objective as I can. The problem here is the same that occurred with ""Plays Live""; a lot of their themes have loose such a part of their original quality. Also there are less ""radical versions"" of the songs than in ""Plays Live"". Nevertheless, the emotion can be felt here, and the sound quality is excellent. This is a live masterpiece, that confirms Gabriel as an artist who can touch and move your soul. But also, his band feature really qualified musicians (Including Paula Cole vocal performance, which I think it's excellent). ""Secret World Live"" is a worthy live album."
5,Buy this album!,"I own a lot of music...this is my favourite album of all time and the main reason I've become such a PG fan. Everytime I listen to it I escape into my own Secret World.If you really want to boost the output get yourself a copy of the concert on video or DVD. This tour was a hallmark for theatrical concert productions and is as stimulating to watch as it is to listen to.A must-have for any serious music fan, and I agree with some of these other reviews...it's healing stuff!"
2,WRONG VERSION OF IN YOUR EYES. . .,"once again, peter gabriel has offered an inferior version of ""in your eyes"" and cannot make the connection to the live promo that came from the ""say anything"" movie sountrack. the soundtrack promo has spirituality that has not been duplicated since. if one can remember the live video from 1989 that had the version, they will know what i'm infering. there was nothing like the backup singer's voice that carried through the air on that promo recording, it was divine."
5,Great!,"No issues with installation or operation. That particular Dell might be a bit old, but it hums like a top."
3,I hate loving this movie....,"Okay, I bought this movie imagining it would turn out completely different than what it really is. When I first watched this movie, I hated it. 2 days after watching, I kept thinking about it. I kept playing the scenes over in my mind and repeating the dialogue back and forth many times. There is soooo much I want to bag on this movie for. But... I don't want to because it is really a pretty good film, that from the looks of it was made with a zero budget. But all of the lighting in the film is great. The camera isn't wobbly like you would think. It is a very well put together film. This is definitely a memorable one!!"
1,Guaranteed to break,"I bought one of these and it broke the first day I used it. Amazon replaced it for free, but for no good because the second one broke soon after I got it too. Very poor laminator. I went to Office Depot and bought one from Xerox and it works much better."
1,seems incredibly overpriced for the pixel count,"I just bought a kodak 3.2 megapixel camera at walmart for $88.this is VERY overpriced, It looks like it should cost $25 or less"
2,I'm not satisfy!,"With this camera I was able to making high quality pictures only outside. Inside of any house or room pictures are ugly. They are in very bad red-light or orange-red color. I do not use this camera as I expected and I can't return because package was opened. Of course, I opened to see how this camera work. But requirements for returns by mail does not aloud to return this useless camera back to their place :-("
1,This Camera Sucks,"Don't buy this camera. It's truly terrible and the support was non-existent. The manual does not even explain how to turn on the flash, let alone how to trouble shoot any other problems. I spent several HOURS trying to get this to work. Don't even bother."
3,Interesting first-hand account from survivor.,"This book was written by a Japanese doctor who lived in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing. It was interesting reading an account from a survivor. Since it comes from a diary and not just memories, in the beginning the people were not even aware of the nature of the bomb. There is more of a technical medical nature than the average reader would prefer, but it's still worth the read. Most surprising to me was the attitude of the people once they knew what kind of bomb it was."
3,Scary looking wolf in the lining! :-),"This sleeping bag is roomy and comfortable. It is warm. It is relatively cheap. I like the storage pocket toward the foot of the bag. The outside of the bag looks good. What kept this bag from five stars for me is the lining. It is not soft when you first take the bag out of the box. It feels stiff, like the lining has fabric sizer in it. Maybe it will be softer after it is washed. And there is this: there is a truly ugly, rabid, mean, scary looking wolf in the lining print. (And I like wolves.) If that doesn't matter to you, this is a decent bag."
5,"""Survive in Style""","ready.gov says be prepared in case of disaster.This sleeping bag #2 (the second one we ordered)is the final step in our 'be prepared' kit. It's inexpensive, yet, light enough to pack, yet warm enough to be cozy."
4,Excellent book!,"If you are preparing for law school or attending law school, then you need to read this book. This book will improve your understanding/analysis of common law and improve your ability to construct legal arguments."
2,Nice but could have been better,Princeton Review's latest book on how to crack the SAT is quite good by giving us an accurate discription on how the problems are formatted and on what system they are laid out but in this process it fails to give many furthur execsice to practise. Hence we are short of practise but on the other hand Barrons book is one of the best I have ever come across. It is nicely and coherently laid out and quite systematically and enough practise skills.
2,"OK, but there are better ones","First and foremost, the CD-ROM that is included in this book was made poorly. It usually crashes or there is something wrong with it. The tips are good but Princeton Review does not give enough excercises to actually apply them to, only drills with 5 or so questions in them. I recommend looking into other test prep companies such as those of Kaplan and Arco. Don't get the version of this book with the CDROM. You can save about $5 and you won't risk having your computer destroyed."
5,The best SAT prep book I have ever bought.,"I have been very stressed out on the subject of the SAT test, considering that it is the basis of college acceptance. This book helped me to get a perfect score on the test. If you are like me, and are completely stressed out, this is the book for you."
1,College Board doesn't endorse this book? What's up w. that?,I almost bought this book because I know a bunch of friends who are taking Kaplan and Princeton Review SAT prep courses. This is the first time I noticed that the college board doesn't endorse the Princeton Review's book. What does that mean? I'm not buying this book!
3,very good for those shooting below 1350,"I bought this book with the intentions of reviewing the material the SAT tests, hoping to raise my score from a 1340 to maybe 1400+. I was disappointed.Instead of reviewing the material, the authors mainly just try to teach you ways to guess. This would be a very good thing for someone who is sure that they have not mastered all the vocabulary or concepts tested and just needs a way to score a few extra points on things they have no clue about, but not someone with an above average score trying to find out what they're messing up on."
1,Not good or helpful for those with semi-decent scores,"This book might help you if you started with an 800 on the SAT, but I started in the 1200-1300 range and found that the Joe Bloggs method and the other innane tricks taught by the Princeton Review are not particularly helpful. Even their vocabulary list is somewhat simplistic. Honestly, this book probably raised my score no more than 20 points. A waste of money and time.The practice tests are also not like the actual SATs. If you want to learn about how actual SATs are, don't expect to find the answers in the back of this book. If you are already scoring high, you should buy 10 Real SATs and maybe get a personal tutor if you can afford one. Good luck!"
5,The best books I have ever read,"I would first like to thank everyone who has contributed in any way to the Princeton Review. I am a high school junior who believes your test prep books are by far the best books I have ever read. They are very concise and to the point and are currently helping me in studying for tests. I have purchased the SAT, ACT, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus Princeton Review Books. I am planning on taking the AP Micro and Macro Economics Exam this May. However, I have not been able to find any books on this subject. Please tell where I can find one or consider publishing one in the future. I know a large number of people who would be interested in buying an AP Economics book. Thanks again for all your help."
1,Pure Garbage,"If I could give it no starsz I would. Instead it gets two thumbs down and a ""Booooooo""!!!! This movie was garbage in its purest form."
2,Not what I expected.,"I am a big fan of Tony Robbins, but this DVD was only a small segment of the RPM system and is a little bit of a commercial. I have heard the old version of this time management system and it is amazing. If you have never heard Anthony Robbins before, this might be worth checking out. It is just a small sample of his stuff. Then, if you are convinced, invest in the full system."
5,Actually.......,"The video was about D-day. It was based off of the D-day scene from Saving Private Ryan. Check your info before you write a review, genius.Anyway, the song is amazing so I'll give it 5 stars, but I don't think I would buy the single cuz the live tracks are probably on Life On The Murder Scene anyway (which I already have)."
2,The SEX PISTOLS!!!????,"I agree that this is not really great rock, but a previous reviewer hold the Sex Pistols as the standard bearer for rock, when John Lydon (AKA Rotten)readily admits the Sex Pistols were/are a ""swindle"" and a fraud. He's also stated that he ""loathes"" rock and roll and wants no part of rock ""history"" or the Hall of Fame.So, while I may not love the music bands like MCR make, at least they make music they like and have a passion for. The only thing Lydon and SP ""mastermind"" Malcom McClarren had a passion for was defrauding the public and trying to cash in on a punk movement that ultimately died off because of the Sex Pistols and other zero-talent acts."
1,OMFG THIS IS SO GOOOOD!!!!11!!!!!!1ONE!1! LOLZZZZZZ,"mmm you know when a band is singing about d-day and are in their mid twentys, they're only trying to get in the pants of aging WWII veterans, and let me tell ya, i don't think anyone's grandpappy fancys gerard way.good job guyz, sing about WWII because you were there, and who knowz it better than you to mass comercialize an event like d-day than you???this is the reason i doubt humanity."
5,Ignore my rating,"First, pay no attention to the rating of five stars. I am not about to rate a church service as if it were for entertainment.""This Holy Night"" is the 2002 Christmas Eve service from St. Luke in Chicago, an Evangelical Lutheran church. The service consists of a good deal of music (including ""Silent Night,"" ""Go Tell It on the Mountain,"" and ""O Come, All Ye Faithful""), Bible readings, a short sermon by Pastor David Abrahamson, and occasional commentary by Rev. Barbara Berry-Bailey to explain aspects of the service that might not be familiar to non-Lutherans or children.The service is quite inclusive. Both the congregation and the clergy include men and women, black and white, and there are members of other Protestant denominations (the United Church of Christ, e.g.) with small roles in the service. Even the music is varied--the performance of ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"" is somewhat jazzy."
3,Ok for the Money,"The pliers on this tool is pretty good.The spring loaded mechanism makes it fairly easy to use.. but the other tools are somewhat useless.It makes for good mini pliers/letter opener.Overall well-made, but I don't see too many uses for it, aside from being very portable"
5,It's tiny and it's perfect that way...,"It's a really tiny tool, I was surprised at first but I really like it. It looks better in real than on the pictures. It seems sturdy enough for the use I want to make of it - does not look cheap at all. It's totally worth the 10 bucks it cost me."
2,Still Don't Know,"Been on order since Oct. Received wrong item first. Knife Country says that they sent a second ""package"". Haven't received it yet. Will send them back the wrong items when I return from overseas."
4,"It's very small, nice looking and a good value","I picked this up for my son inexpensively. It was an impulse purchase, but one he enjoys.It's very attractive, and the case is well made. It's like a pair of folding pliers that have extra tools that might be handy. The pliers work well, the rest of the tools are only okay in quality.It's so small he actually wore it on his watchband today! He'll probably make himself a leather wrist strap for it."
3,Good for Small To-Do Projects,"Intriguing design, probably best for at-home projects that call for small tools. I have to admit, I don't see much use coming from the serrated blade or knife that comes in the multi-tool, due to size, but the other parts (especially the pliers) certainly are usable."
4,"Not the best thing, but a great value","For the price, I don't think you are going to find anything better. It's smallish, but much larger than a Leatherman Squirt. It seems decently made and the selection of tools is good. If you want something to carry every day, I'd keep looking, but for a backup multitool or just something cheap to throw in the car or a BOB, it's a good choice."
4,A Taste Of What Might Have Been,"While I too would prefer to find a reasonably priced collection of all Scotland's Poets singles, I couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer with respect to the quality of the songs on this disc - what we have here are The Poets two Immediate Records 45s (The Rolling Stones first manager Andrew Loog Oldham's mid-60s record label, he was managing this group at the time). The songs themselves are great - interesting arrangements, tuneful, echo in the right places to give that mid-60s ""crunchy"" guitar and drums sound. The group only issued one more single after this before essentially breaking up. If you have an interest in UK 60s beat-orientated music that goes a little deeper than the usual suspects (early Beatles, Stones, Who, Kinks - all fine groups by the way) you won't be disappointed in picking this up at the right price (under $10)."
4,Poets - 'Baby Don't You Do It' (Brook),"A fine four song EP by Scotland's most popular late '60's band - The Poets. Sound quality is great - yet I, too wish this CD could've been a little bit longer. Liked hearing the title cut ""Baby Don't Do It"", the happening ""I'll Come Home"", ""Call Again"" and the familiar-sounding cleverly-penned ""Some Things I Can't Forget"". Personnel: George Callagher - vocals, Hume Paton & Tony Myles - guitars, John Dawson - bass and Alan Weir - drums. Eye-catching cover - don't you agree? I also recommend their 'Try Me Again' DVD / CD (see my review)."
4,CN FAN,"This was the first album I heard by the group way back when it was released - MC Deff is bad - Their second album is a better one and has a song called ""Sick To The Brain"". Even better than this album This is definitely 4 Star Quality"
3,works but not a great deal,I have been doing pro photography for 8yrs & looking for a cheap cam for everyday use but this was just nasty.
4,Canon PowerShot5 G6,A camera more for the advanced photographer with a very detailed instruction booklet. Takes excellent photos in auto mode. Memory chip included is not near big enough.
3,get the digital rebel instead,"At $699, this camera is overpriced. The sensor size is still 1/1.8"". How does this effect you? You can't really get the nice shallow depth-of-field pictures because of the extreme magnification factor required for using a sensor this small.If you're thinking that you'd like to utilize the manual functionality in order to vary depth of field effects, pay the couple hundred dollars more to get the Digital Rebel. You'll get an APS sized sensor which has much less noise at higher ISOs and will let you take good shallow depth of field pictures.If you don't care about the depth of field effects and/or don't plan on taking pictures at higher ISOs, then this may be the camera for you."
4,Peltor WorkTunes,"This product works as advertized. Sound quality is good, as is reception. I believe I received more for the money than I may have expected. I would have rated five stars, but haven't had them long enough to rate durability."
3,Not too good for the hard of hearing,"This is a well built product, but the treble roll-off of the radio is severe and makes for very muffled listening for those of us who already have some high frequency hearing loss. Otherwise, the noise protection is quite good and the radio is sensitive in both AM and FM ranges. Tuning is a bit ackward and it could use digital tuning, or at least a rough frequency indicator on the tuning knob."
2,NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!!!,I have owned numerous pairs of Peltor WorkTunes 25's and this is not the same model. I noticed after receiving them that they had minor diferences than those that I have purchased elsewhere. I have talked to Peltor and they informed me that this is not the normal WorkTune 25-the normal model is Peltor #HRX79A GU. I am tired of large stores having manufacturers make cheap knock offs to make more profit!!
3,Effective protection with mediocre FM reception,"The Peltor WorkTunes work well as hearing protection, but the radio function is pretty marginal. The tuning knob gives you no idea what frequency you are on and the tiniest movement of the little knob will hurtle you right past 2 or 3 stations. It is difficult to accurately tune into a station. When you do find the station by listening long enough for ""station identification"", the reception isn't particularly good. I would suggest saving a few bucks and forgetting the ""Tunes"" or spending more and getting decent radio."
2,"Nice Unit, Poor Sound","Well made, comfortable and attractive. Good protection from outside noise. The sound quality is disappointingly poor. FM broadcast voice sounds muffled and hard to understand. The sensitivity to pick up all but the strongest FM stations is lacking. Returned as unsatisfactory."
4,Good reception - not perfect,"I've tried a few of these radio ear muffs - never had reception that was even close to satisfactory before this. We live about 60 miles from the FM station that I listen to (WAMU). Once I locate the station, the Peltor holds the station pretty well. Ditto for C-Span radio. Cutting grass is no longer quite so boring.AM reception fades as I move around but might work fine if I lived closer to the station."
4,"Owned previous version, couldn't be happier.","I will be ordering one of these, if it works as good as the last two AO Safety Peltor I had will give a 5 star in another review. First one got ran over with my tractor after I laid them on the fender and started baling hay again after making an adjustment to the baler. Second set got ""borrowed"" by one of my step sons for lawn work, he worked for a lawn care business and wants to keep them. Would give 5 stars except station will eventually wander off channel a little as is analog tuned. Have a set of look a likes that is pure junk that would give a 1 star rating."
3,Another great true horse story out of Australia.,"I like this video because it is an awesome true story of courage and determination. Somewhat similar to Phar Lap, it tells the true story of Archer, an Australian race horse, who is taken over the mountains to Melbourne for the inaugural Melbourne cup and wins! And he does it again two more times. There are a couple of unnecessary bad dream sequences, but overall it is quite well done."
1,GOOD BUSINESS RELATION,"I GOT A TERRIBLE COPY OF THIS MOVIE, BUT THE VENDOR WAS QUICK TO REFUND MY MONEY SO ALL I CAN SAY IS ""NO HARM, NO FOUL"", BUT I DID WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE."
2,disappointing,"What a bunch of hype on this book. It's format is so concise as to be practically useless. It seems to be a bunch of class notes cobbled together. Mulitvariable calculus in a book that is only 5 inches across? What a dis-service to the subject. It can barely contain the full definitions for tensor products. Just silly. Lacking examples or much of anything for the reader to bridge the gap his terse prose leaves. A Font so small that indices are lost on some equations. It is no Differential Geometry. The difficulty is not within the subject matter, but with it's meager presentation. Not at all the quality you would expect from this author. God, I hope this isn't ""The"" book on calculus on manifolds. Not to mention the typos. I never knew that f(a)= f(a)+ f'(a)*h...oh wait it isn't, but f(a+h) is! I guess it was tough proof reading a hundred pages with 10 sentences on each page. Get the cheapest version you can."
2,Not suitable as textbook or for self study,"I do not recommend this book. It's not complete and the subject is too abstract and difficult for such a skimpy treatment to get through to the beginning students. At best it might be used as supplemental reading, then it's too expensive (a 100 page paperback.)I suggest instead the books by Buck (easiest to read), Munkres (up-to-date & user friendly) and the magnificent (but difficult) Loomis & Sternberg."
3,Tip of the iceberg...,"This book would serve well as a self-study introduction to smooth manifolds for a student just finishing a high school calculus course. For those serious about the subject, pick up John M. Lee's ""Introduction to smooth manifolds."""
4,Great introduction book,"I used this book in my second year calculus class. It is a great book for introduction, but you have to be very carefull with it, one paragraph of this book equals to one whole chapter of other books. The exercises it suggests are quite challenging. This book isn't for people who want to learn only to work with manifolds, but for people who really want to learn calculus."
5,EXCELLENT TEFLON LUBE,"This is a great product, and it's value for money rating is 5-Stars! I will not hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality teflon lube. It goes on in liquid form, evaporates and leaves a silky teflon coat on whatever you apply it to. EXCELLENT as a bicycle chain teflon lube! Not only does the bottle have the same shape and size as a similar bicycle product (in black container) costing a lot more, the contents feel and smell exactly the same! Buy this and save money."
4,good,"Good cheap sleeping bag. Used in 50 degree weather, and was not overly warm. I kind of doubt the 30 degree rating, but a fine bag. Comfy lining, no sweating."
3,Works fine - and then not,"Have had a Dazzle 6-in-1 for about 6 months. Originally hooked up to a Win98SE box with no problems, and lately to a WinXP Home box, again with no problems. Reads and writes Sony memory sticks just fine - haven't tried with other formats. Just got a Lexar memory stick tho, and it WON'T WORK! I installed the flash upgrade, and no help. The really bad part is that dazzle's support is utterly nonexistent.If I had it to do over again, I'd buy something else..."
1,Doesn't Work Properly.....,Purchased this recently - works fine for my Smart Media card - but can't read or write to my 128MB Memory Stick. Still waiting for a response from Dazzle Support (4 days after submitting query). Will wait a few more days before returning the item.Overall - quite disappointed - had the potential to be a very useful product!
1,"Piece of junk, stay away","This item had lots of promise, but it falls completely flat.I purchased the item, followed the instructions to install it, after I restarted my windows 2000 system twice, it didn't work. It kept resetting my powered USB hub.Turns out, this device does *NOT* adhere to the USB specs ... and does not work if plugged into a USB hub.I called thier tech support people, and was told that they only support a configuration where the devices is plugged directly into the USB port of the computer, no hubs.Unforunately, for me, that's not an option ... the USB on my system is way in the back and I don't want to be reaching back there to swap USB devices around."
3,"Close, but no kewpie doll","The item I actually wanted was the original album that had ""My Life is Over with You"" on it. What I finally received was a different album with the same name and not containing the song I was after. I was very disappointed in this one.The music itself is excellent and it makes a great addition to your collection. It's just not the album I wanted."
4,IF (SciFi_connoisseur == TRUE) { rent_it(); },"A refreshing change from the humdrum of what we call ""movies"" in the US. Very much worth the rental and patience needed to get through the film. Style and presentation are unique, and I loved the low-budget feel. I have more to say but don't want to ruin things, so the short version: ""If you feel like watching true2life grass-roots sci-fi, this is an homage. If you expect blockbuster luster, you're in the wrong bar""."
2,Low Budget Foreign Film,"It's bad when someone in the USA gets a camcorder and decides to make a backyard movie with garage style props. It's downright painful when someone in another country does the same and then inflicts on you the need to ""Read"" the movie to get to the end. This movie would have been far more enjoyable had the producers dubbed the film in english and then allowed the film to be ""Riffed"" for some humor. If you are looking for a Sci Fi flick this is not it! Move on the next film in your list."
4,Horton Hatches the Egg,"After reading this book I can really relate to the character of Horton. This book is such a good example of someone who trying to find out who they are. Horton stayed and waited on that egg because he had promised the mother that he would. What a great role model for kids. Horton was patient, and all that patience paid off in the end when out popped a half bird half elephant. He was faithful to his word."
5,A child's hero,"Horton Hatches the Egg was read to me as an infant. Many years later, I read it to my infant daughter. In my opinion, it is one of Theodor Geisel's (Dr. Seuss) best works. Through his uncanny sense of humor, rhyme and rhythm, he tells a tale of an elephant who gave his word. This story teaches the meaning and value of integrity!"
5,Horton Touches a Tender Heart,"This book can be looked at in a more adult way if we consider the need for adoption of many little-ones that need loving, dedicated true blue parents to become involved no matter what it takes and to weather the storms as they shelter the young. Good for you Horton. You are a blessing to me, keep on being faithful and true to your word, because an elephant's faithful no matter what."
1,Horton Hatches the Egg,I was very disappointed when I received this book in the mail. It said it was in good shape but when I got the book there were stickers all over the front of the book. I was able to take the stickers off but was still disappointed it said nothing about them being on there when I ordered the book.
5,"It should be, it should be, it should be that way!","Some see this as the triumph of hard work, patience, and loyalty. I guess I can see that. Certainly, lazy Mayzie is as villianous a deadbeat parent as I can think of, and Horton strikes a noble contrast.However, I couldn't help reading this as Dr. Seuss' take on nature vs. nurture. Horton does all the real nurturing, and out comes an elephant-bird, a Lamarkian triumph and an inspiration to adoptive parents. I'm not sure if it's what Dr. Seuss believes to be true or if it is what he wishes to be true, ""it should be, it should be, it should be that way.""I could do without the scene where the hunters point their rifles straight at Horton's heart, but that's just me. Evidently I'm too gentle for the world of children's literature.Big thumbs up, though, good story, good rhymes, and not as insipid as the lazy-Mayzie ""wocket in my pocket""-era Seuss. Most importantly, my daughter loves it."
5,Enchanting and fun for all,Horton Hatches the Egg is a wonderful tale for young and old alike. I read it as a child and now read it to my own children. I was the library coordinator for my child's first grade class and was having a very difficult time controling twenty two unruly kids. Horton to the rescue. The kids loved the tale of the faithful elephant shouting out each and every time that this elephant was faithful one hundred percent. You will love this book one hundred percent !
4,English and Mandarin,"Bought this for my son who is in a Mandarin Immersion Kindergarten. I was looking for something that had Mandarin and English so we could try to translate the story together. We're not quite there with the translation, but I think this will help us get there. I see him looking at the Mandarin characters while I'm reading the English. I can also still enjoy the story with my 3 y/o."
4,Horton keeps his promise to watch over lazy mayzie's egg,"Dr. Suess wrote another wonderful book for children. We read it to our adopted child as it shows a special bond between Horton and the egg. Although we do explain Mayzie's reaction to her egg is not typical to how ""Birth Parents"" feel. We have found this book to be very educational as well as intertaining."
4,Horton Sits on the Egg,It is about an elephant that sits on an egg for weeks and months.People laugh and tease Horton and then two men try to hunt him down. To find out more read this book by Dr. Seuss. This book is funny and likeable.
3,I'd forgotten how violent classic Seuss was,"I still love this book, but I won't read it to my nearly-three-year-old daughter yet. I'd forgotten how violent classic Seuss was.There are extended references to guns and pictures of hunters pointing a gun at Horton.I'm not ready to destroy this part of her innocence just yet. I'm disappointed bacause as soon as the book arrived, I picked it up and started reading it. I had to improvise quickly to get through the ""hunter"" portion of the book. We have put this one away for now. We will re-introduce it in a year or two."
3,Funy Pic,"Not to bad good for a laugh, and who would not want jennifer love hewitt chasing asfter them. my god. wow"
3,"Better than ""That Thing you Do""","Ok, a lot of people are hammering this movie pretty hard and their opinions are justified. This movie is sort of wack. But it does have enough moments, excuse me, enough Jennifer Love Hewitt to make me like this film. The acting is subpar with the exceptions of Hewitt and Brenneman, and it isn't even remotely funny. Basically this movie gets a good rating because of JLH's awesome presence here."
2,2 stars for Jennifer!,"Ya know, with Will Ferrell and Jennifer Love Hewitt in this movie, I thought it would be an awesome movie...Well, I can't always be right. The one part I did like in the movie was when Jennifer Love Hewitt showed one of her tattooes to a band member's wife... (requiring her to lift up her dress, catching a peak at her undies) :D Nice..."
5,Great Reference Guide,great visual guide for the coin collector who needs help with the grading their collection
5,An Advanced College Degree In Coins,"This book is terrific. I am a new collector, and, am never without it. I thank the friend, every fay , who told me to buy this book, before another coin."
1,Worst book from Whitman ever,"The black and white photo's look like photocopies of photocopies.And to add insult to everyone, the book is printed in CHINA...Whitman has sunk to a new low on this one.Buy any other book other than this one if you really want to use it.The poorest book that Whitman has ever offered, lets hope it's not theirstandard for the future."
5,Excellent Coin Grading reference,There is a reason why this publication has been around for many years --- it os the standard for coin grading. This latest edition does not diminish from the previous editions in high standrd. This is the best!
1,Review of book.,"It was poor at best. It was all black and white, no color. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,"I'll do the stars, but this part is too much for every bloody purchase... If something it extra special or dang annoying I will","I'll do the stars, but this part is too much for every bloody purchase... If something it extra special or dang annoying I will let you know"
5,Christmas present for impossible uncle,Ordered this and another book after failing to find anything for my uncle for Christmas. Was worried they wouldn't arrive in time or would be dinged up . That was not the case at all. Arrived quickly in great shape and he loved it!!!
3,Disappointing details of basically good product,"Knowing this brand, I had high expectations for this product. While the overall concept is good, the details are lacking. In the picture, the cars look like aerodynamic race cars. In reality, they are shaped more like half-ovals on wheels. After painting their cars, my kids were very excited to add racing stripes and flames to their creations, but the ""stickers"" didn't stick at all. Even with glue, getting them to stay on was a challenge. I believe the instructions may have said to apply stickers first, then paint, but that is ridiculous. What kid wants to risk painting over their stickers? A clear varnish that would seal the stickers to the cars would be a HUGE improvement for this product. I am going to look into something like that to give our cars that finishing touch. The cars are pull and go, which is nice, and in general my kids really enjoyed painting the cars. On this one, the devil was in the details."
1,Not received,The seller misplaced my books. Could it be they offered it too cheaply or just poor record keeping?
3,not for cold weather,"The look, feel and overall quality of this blanket is nice. I appreciate the large 62"" x 80"" as well. Unfortunately, I bought this as a camping blanket for cool/cold nights. I have learned that there is a definite difference between 70/30 wool blankets and 100% wool. This blanket is very nice to have in the house as a nice throw to take the chill off, but it will not keep you warm outside in the cold. I held it up to the light and you can see through it...the weave is not ""tight"" and the material is thin. I am keeping the product b/c I like the way it looks, its size and it will serve nicely for cover indoors. If you want something to keep you warm outside, get a 100% heavy, thick wool blanket."
4,Good value.,"The blankets did have a strong chemical smell and needed to washed three times with Oxiclean and plenty of fabric softener in cold water, after air drying in the sun the two blankets I bought they are great. I give the blankets four stars for the price and the size (a perfect size for a queen-size memory foam mattress, used under the fitted sheet to keep from overheating."
2,not what I was expecting,"This product arrived labelled ""55% wool"" not the 70% advertised. I pointed this out to the vendor's service rep who said they had no control over how Amazon advertised their products. Not a bad blanket for the money, but not what I was expecting."
5,Warm simple wool blanket,On the cold winter nights I needed one more blanket layer for my double bed. This simple plain wood blanket was cost-effective answer. Good value.
2,freezups,"Beautiful picture if you can get it to play. I have experienced constant freeups. After I returned the player to the manufacturer,they sent me a new one which I had just received this week; however, this one is worst than the original player. This not an isolated problem. Before I purchased this player, I read several reviews about the same problem; however, I didn't listen, I found out the hard way."
1,"Broke, will have to be returned","Did not have good luck with this unit; after only a couple of uses on car trips with kids, screen went blank, could not get picture back. Hooked up to TV for a few days, then it started skipping and freezing up. Got as a christmas gift, so now we have to figure out how to return it for a refund. Would not recommend to others."
4,Good product..Glad I bought it,"I bought this player about 5 months ago. I did alot of research and thought this was the right price and had all the accessories I was looking for. I have had some trouble with the player skipping with some DVDs. The skipping is really annoying, but I can live with it because it does not happen everyday or with every DVD. The strengths of this package are the items that come with the player (ready to plug into a car and/or plug in to my tv console for the kids while taking a long trip...)"
1,Great while it lasted !!,"We purchased this unit for Christmas of 2002. In July 2003 the player quit entirely...disc would spin but the screen was flat gray. No picture. Called Audiovox, they had no idea what the problem was and said to ship it back. Spent $10 to return via ups. They could not repair so sent a replacement. The 2nd one worked until January of 2004, then quit also. This time I was told that because the 1 year warranty had expired (from the date of purchase-not the date of replacement) I was out of luck. I could send it back for repairs at my expense. Fortunately I had the foresight to have purchased it on American Express which automatically doubles a warranty up to one year. Amex is going to refund my money so that I can purchase a new unit. The next one will definitely NOT BE AN AUDIOVOX!!"
5,Great product,"Watch this every day. I have never had any problems. Have heard occasional complaint that it has a skipping problem, but don'tknow what they are talking about. Works flawlessly, even when I carry from room to room. Great picture, great sound."
1,Please avoid this Unit!,I bought this Portable DVD player at Super Target on sale and when I got it home it played very well and had a nice picture until I tried to watch a complete movie on it. It seemed like it got really hot about halfway through the movie and when I tried to adjust the brightness of the screen it was unresponsive. Then the movie froze and totally locked up so I had to unplug the unit and replug it back in to get it to work.I took it back to Target the next day and got my money back. Target gave me a little hassle about paying a restocking fee but I talked them out of it. If it locks up the first time you use it what's going to happen a year from now? Buyer beware!
4,Great little machine,"I purchased the AudioVox 1680 for a trip to Florida with the grandchildren. We had quite a long plane ride and they were totally consumed in watching Harry Potter. It played with no trouble, but I noticed it was hot when the movie finished. My husband devised a stand that would allow the air to circulate under the unit and it has worked beautifully. I also use it when my husband watches a western on TV. Put the ""earbuds"" on and he doesn't even know I'm around. I like the ""earbuds"", as they allow two to listen. I think I made a good choice in the AudioVox 1680."
5,"If you have small children, buy this one....","After excruciating research, it can down to crunch time to buy a DVD player for our end-of-summer vacation car trip. The high-end Panasonic model that we chose wasn't available in time, so we ""settled"" for this unit. What a pleasant surprise! Despite the reviews regarding skipping, sound, & screen size, we had no issues (okay, just one, when my 2-year old insisting on trying to play his peanut-butter smudged DVD, but easily resolved!) We bought a splitter with two headsets...perfect for plane trips, for which we appreciate a smaller unit for packing purposes. Since we didn't spend as much money, we are less nervous about our small children using this...the sound, performance, and battery/power adapters either met or exceeded our expectations."
1,waste of money,Audiovox should be ashamed of selling a product this unreliable. I think it worked for the first month and then completely went downhill. One out of twenty DVD's (maybe) will work in it and it's practically brand new. I'm super (mad) at this waste of money!!
5,One awesome product,I was looking for a convienent portable dvd player to use while I travel and this one is perfect. It's very light weight and I don't think it's bulky at all. It's really awesome how you can hook it up to your tv. I was first attracted to this item because of the price. This is a really bargin I still can't believe I got such a wonderful product for such little money. I would recommend this product to anyone. It's very simple to use anyone could use it. This is just one awesome product. I'm glad I bought it now I don't want to be without it.
5,"Audiovox, an underrated company that can hold it's own.","I just received the 1680 dvd from audiovox. I love it. It comes with everything you need. For all you ""soccer moms"" out there who, like I, spend your life in the car waiting for someone, it sure does make the time pass quicker. I am catching up on all the movies I would have liked to have seen had I had the time. I also have a younger child that is getting use in the car. Some of the bigger makers charge you extra for the car adapter but you receive it with the audiovox. you also get a battery that will take you to the end of any movie you have even if you get out of the car. The battery is charging as you are watching so it is always ready."
1,2nd Unit Didn't Work Either,"...I found that it played maybe 1 out of every 3 dics I put in it, and even the 1 it would play it would sometimes freeze up or slow down. Well, I thought that every assembly line is entitled to one lemon, so I returned it to Amazon. Well the 2nd one has been no better. The first couple of discs did play (one with a couple of slow downs), so that lulled me into a false sense of security. Since then, no disc I have put into the unit has played. Tonight I put a brand new disc of the ""Great Escape"" into the unit 26 times and it did not play once.I'm 43 years old and this is without a doubt the single worst consumer product I have ever purchased. As I said above, I'll give every manufacturer one bad product, but not two. And to top it off, I waited too long to really test this 2nd unit out and Amazon won't let me return it. This is the biggest piece of [junk] I've ever purchased."
1,this product is a bad investmest,"I bought this dvd player in the beginning of November this year. I got to play about 2 dvds before I startede seeing trouble with it playing movies. Then around the beginning of December, it stopped working. It just loads up and says invalid entry. Now I'm stuck with a broke dvd player and I cant return it because I bought it at a Target across the country."
3,NOT a 16:9 as stated in description,"I bought this unit from Amazon a few months ago because I was looking for a low-cost portable DVD player with a wide-screen. The player works great, but just be aware that the screen is 4:3.As such the actual screen size is much smaller than a 6.8"" or 7"" player with a 16:9 screen.Also, another minor thing that bugs me is that in spite of having a remote control, you cannot control the volume from the remote."
2,Nothing but problems,"I just purchased this thing one week ago. I tried a dvd given to me by a friend. The dvd kept freezing up. I thought it was the dvd. When I tried 2 brand new out of the box dvd's. They both were freezing up. This is not the dvd player for me. Maybe this is a bad unit, I just do not know. I think I will look for something else."
2,An Excellent Player,"This player is the Best! I wasn't sure how well it would work for the price, since others I have looked at were ""considerably more"". My son was thrilled with it. The quality of the picture is excellent, the sound is perfect, and it doesnt get hot. We have gotten over 3 hours on the battery, and the unit has not froze once. I would highly recommend it. Definitely got my money's worth! And Thank you Amazon.Com, as, you promised and delivered exactly like you said. Just in time for Christmas!"
1,Skips Repeatedly,"This unit was a waste of money. After 2 days, it began skipping and would occasionally even freeze totally. The remote control didn't work properly, even within inches of the unit. The included ear-bud headphones only produced sound on one side. Made in Taiwan.... Better go for the Japanese players."
2,A [Bad] Excuse for a DVD Player,"I personally didn't like it beacause of the strange color, it was rather ugly, and I used it twice and the speakers fried."
4,"Great player, perfect performance","WOW! This item is worth the money. It's quality is perfect and it basicly has no downside to the player.Pros: Perfect video and audio quality, great 7"" screen, supports all formats, and good 3.5 battery life. The player also comes with everything you need like a/v cable, a/c adapter except it doesn't come with a case (well almost none do).Cons: The battery is pretty big and bulky and kind of hangs out of the end of the player. Also the battery drains out when not pluged in. One more thing, it takes long to load Mp3-CDs.This player is great in all, and worth buying."
2,tooooo hot!,"We purchased this unit about 3 weeks ago and noticed the very first day how incredibly hot this unit gets! We have only watched about 4 movies on it so far, but every time we do it gets very hot in the base near the AC/DC adapter, and the last time we used it, very hot in the upper left corner above the screen. It works fine so far, although the volume could be louder on the speakers. I cannot believe that it is good for the unit to operate at these temperatures, and with all of the bad reviews, I plan on trying to return mine to Wal-Mart."
1,Buyer beware,"After a single day's use the DC adapter quit working. In order to get the necessary replacement, the warranty requires that you mail the entire unit back to Audiovox.This is a hassle that I did not anticipate having to deal with the day after receiving the player in the mail.Thanks for nothing Audiovox."
1,NOT Worth the Aggravation!,"The product was a good price so we purchased it as an intro to portable DVD players. Not worth the aggravation! Has a terrific picture. Easy to operate. Sound/Volume is definitely too low for some situations. BUT this player gets hot way to quickly! We have placed it in well ventilated areas, raised it, kept the lid open when playing it thru the television -- ALL to keep it cool. Not long after purchasing this, it started to malfunction - freeze up - misqueue dialogue, skip. Then very soon after it simply wouldn't play most DVD's. Discs would spin intermittenly while attempting to load - never loading - no way would movies play. Then a few days later, it might work for a full movie or part of a movie. Then nothing. Exchanged it for another. EXACT same problems. It a shame. It had a great picture the few times it operated properly. DO NOT BUY!"
3,Not too shabby,"I exchanged an Audiovox D1700 for this model. I've had it several months now and it works great-most of the time. However, on a recent plane trip, I watched a movie for 2 hours, then had to change DVD discs. When I put in the 2nd disc, it started skipping and freezing. I think it was because the unit had gotten hot. As long as you don't stop the player before the movie is over and then restart it again, it seems to work fine.I also had some brief freezing issues with a new DVD recently.Overall, I think it's a good value for the money."
5,What a SURPRISE!,"This movie is scrumtrulescent! I was a bit skeptical when I first heard of it, but what a surprise. Too many comedies these days rely on sensational, unbelievable acts to get a laugh. This movie didn't have some crazy scene where the main characters were riding a tiger, rather it relied on good writing and a few crazy antics by the actors to deliver its hilarity. If you laughed at Napolean Dynamite, then you will definitely laugh at this movie too!"
2,BAD FIT,"ALL OLGA BRAS RUN SMALL...FOR SOME REASON, OLGA BRAS ARE MADE SMALL ON THE SIDES OF THE CUP..I AM A 36 DD, NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BALI, ETC...I HAVE TRIED MANY OLGA BRAS ON AND HAVE ALSO TRIED ON A NEXT LARGER CUP SIZE, I HAVE TRIED GOING DOWN A BAND SIZE AND UP THE CUP SIZE, OR WHATEVER, STILL USELESS FOR ME ANYWAY..IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD BRAND FOR ME..I WAS TOLD BY 2 FITTERS, IF YOU ARE A 36 DD, YOU ARE A 36 DD, THAT IS THAT. SOME BRANDS ARE JUST NOT RIGHT FOR YOU, SO DON'T TRY CHANGING THE SIZES...I AGREE......THANK YOU, GOOD LUCK"
3,olga sheer tapestry bra,"I have worn this style for years, and love it. However, in the past 2 years, the quality has declined dramatically. The 'tapestry' outer fabric in the outer layer, starts to fall apart after about 10 washings.(gentle cycle, cool water,no bleach). Maybe that is why so few stores carry Olga any more."
5,underwire bra,"Itis my favorite style and type of bra, so I was happy to be able to order it online at a reasonable price.It is as I expected and came on time."
1,Poor sizing,"The sizing is seriously off on this item. I am on the small side of a 36D and prefer minimizer bras. Although I always wearing bras on the tightest hook, on even on the loosest hook, this bra was too tight. The D cup fit like a B cup."
2,Buyer Beware,"I was very disappointed in this product. The keyboard and mouse itself look great and feel high quality. The keys on the keyboard are ultra-quiet. However, the keyboard never worked (the mouse did work great and is the only reason I gave this product 2 stars as opposed to 1). Technical support for Memorex has very funky hours, but when they were open, they could only tell me that indeed, my keyboard did not work. Thanks guys. Office Depot/Amazon was great in returning the product even though the return period was up (which makes me wonder if this is a common problem)."
2,Keyboard - Great ; Mouse - Bad,"They keyboard is great. After successfully installing and connecting it to the computer, it works like a champ. However, I would do something about the icons on the keyboard. They aren't always easy to interpret quickly.The mouse is another story. I could never get it to install via PS/2. Plus, even if I had, the shape is not comfortable, as in the center front of the mouse, the shape rises to a high peak. Really high, and forcing my fingers to feel like they're curling down."
1,Caveat Emptor II (another buy at your own risk),"I have had this keyboard for 4 months. I never did like the mouse so I didn't use it other than to verify its function. It worked, but lacked 100% every time precision that a cable-connected mouse has. The keyboard however, worked like a champ for about 3 months. Then for the last several weeks of its life I would have to re-initialize the transmitter/receiver. It would work fine for a day or two, then I would have to re-init again. Then finally it stopped even re-initializing. I did the normal troubleshooting, checked the batteries, connections, interference from other devices that transmit, etc. I believe it has bought the farm."
3,cool book,its a pretty good book but i expected a more intellegent book. id say it's more for the 12 year olds mind rather than a 16 year old. it doesn't have the info that i want.
2,Old information. Need new edition!!,"I had thought that my 5 years old loves this book as the pictures are big and great along with the information..... Yes, information is very important for those ages since they observe very quickly. First, we need updated information on it. This book was published 2001. During the course of this past decade, there have been so many changes happened. I take my boy to Smithonian Air and Space museum and he naturally learned the updated information. In matter fact, my boy pointed out some of it. For example, 'Black Hawk' has been retired long time ago. (but this book says that the plane is active so as Space Shuttle.) If you are looking for the kids who loves airplanes, but not looking for the aculate information beside the great photos, this will be a wonderful book. If DK makes updated edition, it would be GREAT."
3,Only pretty good,"Have to agree with Jeff S. The battery compartment on my radio has to be taped shut. And you must have the manual to configure it. Only worth buying if you can get it well below MSRP, or better still, free."
2,"Product is cheaply made, Customer Service was terrible from Elmosworld","I purchased 2 of these items, on one of them, the LCD display does not work perfectly (the 0 as a part of 12:00 pm is missing a line of the 0 on the display- see my submitted pictures) but this is no big deal- the item still works OK.The other product arrived damaged since it has a battery compartment door that is made of cheap plastic at the bottom of the unit and UPS damaged it during shipping.It took me filing a complaint with Amazon just to get a response from this company, and the situation is still not resolved, they have not offered to send me a free return label to send it back to them.I will never order from Elmosworld again. Terrible customer service."
5,Sad to see it end,The first two books in the Trilogy were so good that I was skeptical the final book could keep up the momentum but this was fantastic.It leads the Wangs into modernity with relevant historical facts hidden in the deep heart of the Tiger's only son who struggles to find his place in the world.
5,Love It!,This is Pearl S. Buck at her best. She is a gifted writer that uses your imagination to its fullest.
4,I agree,"I agree with the review from August 8, 2000 in that Mary Anne needs to move on and it wouldbe cool to have her do something else. However, I did really enjoy the book. I thought When Mary Anne helped Sunny it showed more of her personality from the old series, and I liked that Mary Anne more. I thought it was funny how active Sunny was."
3,let's have Mary Anne move on,"I enjoyed reading this book as much as I usually do the newest in this series, but I have a problem with the plot development. This is the 11th book in the series and Mary Anne's plot line is still focused on the fire and its effects on MA. While I am sure that a family catastrophe like that would have lasting effects on a girl her age, I think Mary Anne's next installment book should have a new adventure or experiance. Kristy's books in this set have had diversity of plot and so have Stacey's. Let's get Mary Anne some ineteresting new story lines. A new project at school (she could work on yearbook or newspaper) a new hobby, or even a new boyfriend would improve her plot considerably. This book is a quick read though and I enjoyed the part about the girls sneaking off to NYC for the day."
1,Warning: Same book Under 2 Titles,This book also appears under the title: An Opened GraveSame author. Annoying to get the same book twice.
5,old school,This album has some great songs. I used to have this on tape and I wanted to get the album again and it has songs that I've not heard in awhile.
3,"Comfortable, but noisy with voice echo","According to people I called with this phone, voice quality was very good on their end, and the received voice quality on my end was also good. The handset is comfortable to hold and the earpiece is easy on the ear, but from there it was downhill. Like many other cordless phones, the 36247 exhibited strong voice echoing when speaking into the phone, which as you all know is very annoying. After walking only a short distance outside away from the house, I got a lot of static and interference, breaking up conversations. I have a 2-yr old VTECH 9111 900MHz analog that provides much better quality performance. I didn't get a chance to use the CID or any other functions because the phone was immediately returned."
1,LOUSY PHONE,"Good Price with a nice package, but very poor quality sound. We purchased 2 of these phones...both had echo, and low sound quality. We could not even have a conversation with the other party. Both are being returned!!"
4,"Great Collection, but why leave out ""In Your Eyes""?","I have always thought the title to this album to be somewhat tounge in cheek- ""16 Golden Greats""- where some of the songs were not actually singles, sort of making fun of ""Greatest Hits"" collections. I think this is an excellent collection, particularly for anyone who does not own any of Peter Gabriel's albums and wants a ""taste"" of what his music is all about. I don't understand why ""In Your Eyes"" was left out. Not only is it one of the great songs on ""SO"", which itself is a masterpiece, it is one of the best of Mr. Gabriel's songs that played regularly on the radio, right up there with ""Games Without Frontiers"",""Sledgehammer"" and ""Don't Give Up"". I would have given a 5 star rating if that classic song would have been included. A very fine album nonetheless."
4,Missing an important song,"Though the remastering is a great improvement, this CD should have been reissued as ""17 Golden Greats"" with the addition of ""In Your Eyes"", easily one of his most famous songs. If it wouldn't have fit, at least half of these tracks could have been replaced with it. I guess the compilers didn't want ""So"" to go out of print."
5,Great memories,This is a must have if you're a Peter Gabriel fan. Brings back a lot of fond memories for me.
2,Peter Gabriel C.D.,"The C.D. is great - pity that the ""jewel case"" was badly cracked when I unpacked it!"
5,Peter Gabriel at his finest.....,"All the best by one of the best political song writers of our time.....Each song, while entertaining is a statement about the world in which we live in. Most songs are very general in nature and can be applied to a multitude of issues facing society. My personnal favorite, which I renamed The Management Song, is ""I Don't Remember"". It explains the easiest catch phrase coined by Politicians, CEO's, Bankers, and anyone else caught after the fact......."
4,"Just a CD, do not think too much, enjoy",I read all the 3 star reviews. By the way this is just aother PG Cd. Do not put too much thought nor energy to it. I own every PG CD and love 80%+ of the songs in them. What is the big deal for missed the In Your Eye in this CD? The rest of them is still good!! This would be great for people who would like to have a quick snap shot of PG's music. I think every PG's CD is collectable. I even bought LP for many of them. Hope you enjoy this CD.
3,Could have been a better compilation...,"...it just does not quite do Mr Gabriel's career justice. He is after all a brilliant lyricist, a multi musician with a carrer spanning several decades and a good spell of time as a great bands front man and a solo artist. So why so few songs and why just those of the greater popular appeal? The beauty of Gabriel's music is in discovering the unknown as well as the old favourites. This collection is getting old too and could do with a radical update. Like other reviewers I was dissapointed with the pick axe editing and the fact that ""In your eyes"", a song that is so beautiful it can bring you to tears, is not even here. I hope Peter gives his production people a good kick in butt when this album is up for an update!"
5,Shaking The Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats,"Absolutely outstanding! One of my personal top 5 CD's of all time. If you are not a die-hard Peter Garbiel fan, you really should buy this one. A few songs I didn't like on their original mix were greatly improved like, ""I Have The Touch"". Although the purist might be offended by the alterations, someone who is not a Gabriel fan will become one after hearing so many excelent tracks all on one CD."
5,better than the new greatest hits,"Even though its not a double cd, this cd is special for having the song ""Shaking the Tree"". A must in the Peter Gabriel collection. Downfall of this album is the fact that its outdated. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, Gabriel II, Us, So and Up. You will have a great collection of his best work. If you're a fan buy everything, trust me its worth it."
4,Excellent Peter Gabriel,"This album gives any listener an excellent overview of Gabriel's range and talent. From the commercial ""Slegehammer"" to ""Family Snapshot"" the man's talent is phenomenal. A must for any serious music listener."
4,"Good, but not the best way to sum up Gabriel's career","I cannot make my mind up about this album. My instant reaction is to advise people to ignore it -- except as a cheap way of collecting together the best from Gabriel's first three albums -- and to buy each of 'Security', 'So' and 'Passion', because in my view, Gabriel hit his best patch in that period. All are 5-star masterpieces.But I have to admit to a partial ignorance of Gabriel's work. Though I have all his subsequent output, I don't own the first three albums. Some reviewers say that the first two are flawed, but I have had friends who swore by his early stuff.The best compilations are the ones you make for yourself!"
3,One CD is just not enough,"Gabriel's talent makes a one CD greatest hits package a near impossibility; consider this instead a sampler. Dominated by songs from his commercial breakthrough SO, SHAKING THE TREE really only takes a look at three of Gabriel's works (III, Security, SO) with a few novelties like the title cut from Youssou N'Dour's THE LION and a few other works re-recorded with some musical adjustments. It really is for completists only and you'll be better served with HIT, but even that falls short of really capturing the essence of this artist."
5,Amazing for problem feet,"I have plantar fasciitis which is easily aggravated by most shoes - especially sandals. It has been especially difficult to find sandals that don't bother my feet. To complicate matters, I blister easily. And, I need adequate but not hard arch support or I have foot pain.These sandals are the most comfortable I have ever worn. I wear them all day - I hike and walk the dogs in them - I even have run in them when I've needed to - without any problems. I would give the six stars if I could for comfort without looking like clunky old-lady shoes."
3,"Comfortable, but didn't work for me","These shoes were very comfortable, but made too much noise while walking. An air pocket formed and caused a sound with each step. I have poorly formed feet so it is probably more a problem with my feet than the shoes. I wish they didn't do that because they were so comfortable."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"PRODUCT WELL MADE, SIZED PROPERLY, LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE. HOWEVER, SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN. STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME, AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL"
4,Nice sandals but the sizing is off,I don't have good luck with this brand. I bought Propet walking shoes that I had to return because they were too small. I like the looks of these sandals and I read the reviews that said they run large so I thought they might fit me. I ordered my usual size and they were too small. My toes were right at the end. I returned those and ordered the next size up. This time the length was just right but the shoes are wider! Even with the velcro adjustment I can't get them comfortably snug. This is just me. They are nice sandals and I really wish they fit me. If Propet shoes fit you then you'll like these sandals.
1,May look like SAS shoes but can't match the quality.,"This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes, but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather, that when walking in my livingroom, the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes. Had to send them right back. Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself."
3,Breeze Walker Review,I thought the 3 straps were all velcro. What is the use to a disabled person of a shoe that is almost impossible to put on unaided? They are very comfortable for walking but I have reservations about their lasting quality..
1,I had to return the shoes.,"Propet Women's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker, but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them. I was very disappointed and returned the shoes. The return was easy, and I appreciated the service I received, just not the product."
4,Sooooooooooooo comfy !,"My wife has a hard time finding strap-back velcro or buckle sandals in a wide width and a short size..... these are almost perfect. The only problem is that the buckle strap is very short and a bit hard for her to buckle - aside from that, she LOVES these sandals ! She says ""HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"""
5,Arizona Sun Requires Propet Sandals,"The heat in Arizona makes everything hot, especially your feet. It would be so uncomfortable without Propet Sandals. I purchased a pair last year and was overjoyed to be able to purchase two pairs this year. Try them. You too can be comfortable no matter how hot it gets."
5,Propet Shoes,Propet breeze walker sandals were received as described ... before estimated delivery date. Would order this product again.
5,Propet Breeze Walker,This shoe is very comfortable and so far easy to clean. They were comfortable at the first wearing. They are excellent when you have a lot of walking to do.
2,Would not buy again.,These shoes run much smaller than Clark's. I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I couldn't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days.
5,Most Comfortable Sandals I Own,Like walking on air. They are well cushioned and adjustable width. I'll buy these in other colors for sure. The ankle strap provides some support. I've had a couple of ankle surgeries so I need really well padded soles and these provide the comfort I need.
2,Send them back,"Looked like they were substantial sandals. I looked at the pictures very carefully, though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap. It was not rounded and finished off soft, rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes. Shame, other than that it was a decent sandal."
5,Much Better than Flip Flops,"Bought my first pair a couple of years ago. Just bought two more pairs to take on a cruise. They are attractive have good support and are comfortable to walk in. the two velcro front straps were a great adjustment idea. My old ones still have a lot of wear left. Will use for yard work, etc."
2,Head In The Clouds Is A Very Appropriate Title For This Movie,"Charlize Theron, her real life boyfriend Stuart Townsend, and Penelope Cruz are all nice to look at, and have at times shown considerable tlane in their work, Theron having won as Osca for her role in Monster.But Head In The Clouds is one of those beautifully filmed films starring a beautiful cast that trying to stay beautiful in an increasingly ugly world, particularly Europe in the 1930s. From the Spanish Civil War to World War II, the stories of these three people who share a Paris flat together is supposed to be a sweeping tragedy that shows how world events and fate can conspire to thwart true love.Instead, it shows how silly things can be when you mix hedonism, narcissism, social responsbility, and sheer stupidity. You end up caring less about the characters, andwondering more how much more trouble will they get themselves in. This was a pretty stylish waste of time for everyone involved."
2,Long and not very interesting,This period piece seems to run on forever. The characters establish themselves well enough but there is no compelling story to grab our attention. The sets also had a fake look to them - I don't think this was filmed on location. It felt like I was watching a stage rendition of Paris - it's hard to figure out what's wrong but the whole hting looks fake and not very well done.
1,pleeeezz charleeeezz,"One has to wonder how a film so bad can be made with so many fine things about it. I see from other reviews that the really horrible actor Stewart Townsend is Charlize Theron's boyfriend. She won an Academy Award so she got to demand his inclusion probably. He cannot act and he utterly cannot imagine what it would be like to be the man he plays in this movie. He has sex with the Charleezz character often. That he knows how to do. And Charlize probably ignored direction because her acting is utterly unaffecting. The beautiful wonderful Penelope Cruz is underused. No gorgeous closeups of her gorgeous face and she dies early. Is this the fault a dumb director/writer, John Dagan? The cinamentography is lovely. The costumes are fine. The story is ok as well. Its just shown in a way that is as boring as it can be and we probably have Charlizzzzz to thank for that for dragging in her idiot boyfriend and rejecting direction. Come to think of it, I havent seen much by her lately."
2,Head in the Clouds is worth a look,"It isn't the greatest World War II movie ever made or the greatest love story, but it could be a lot worse. None of the actors seem to have any chemistry together and it moves along very slow. It is worth renting, but I would stick to any other WW2 love story if you wanted something with more substance. This is alright, but nothing worth writing home about."
1,head in the crapper,"The people are pretty, the settings are pretty. The entire first half of the film is devoted to gratuitious sex -- gratuitous because there's no chemistry between the lovers OR between them and the audience. Why would hedonistic Gilda fall for an intellectual cypher like Guy? Why wouldn't he be infatuated with the sex, thinking he was in love with her? I WANTED the erotic scenes to move me; they didn't. G&G move in together, life is boring. Mia moves in, life gets giggly. War approaches, Guy and Mia are suddenly impassioned by it rather than Gilda, who pouts. Yaddayaddayadda. No suspense, no depth of character, blahblahblah. I think the fault lies mostly with really poor directing and editing. Can't believe Theron performed like a such ham after her previous roles. Penelope tried and failed to overcome the script. Probably a 17-year-old would think the story everything that it isn't -- exciting, romantic, sexy, deep....."
4,full of twists and turns,"Tour Into Danger is a fast-paced and suspenseful read full of twists and turns. Penny takes her young nephew and runs to Hawaii, trying to protect the child and escape the threat of his mother's killer. But danger follows them there and Penny doesn't know where to turn. Help arrives from an unlikely source. Murder mystery meets romantic suspense and it all happens in a fabulous setting. Tour Into Danger held me until the final page."
4,horse sense for people,"This book is an easy read for people interrested in horses- combined with people recoveries. It speks about respect and engaging into the language the person/horse concerned already speaks. It may be revolutionary to people who have a past of/in violence (verbal or physical) even if its just at low levels. It helped me makeing sence of a whole bundle of feelings, ideas, perseptions and ideals. This book does contain one chapter which speaks very direct and hosistic about one particular case of child abuse. Wich is defnetly R18!!! Usefull read in my view as a future Social Practitioner."
4,Horse Sense for People,"Monty Roberts is a master in all methods of knowledge (horsemanship, writing, etc.). This book, although not quite to the level of his great The Man Who Listens to Horses, still contains vital information for all those who would like to learn about the many lessons that life has to offer. His books should be read by all, including those who have to knowledge or interest in horses."
1,Not Gangsta Enough,"So im at Media Play and i see this cd, the album cover looks as if its a new white rapper... I get it back to the house and listen to it, skippin all tracks that sound like some love songs. There are only 2 that are good ""I get it Fired up"" and ""2 of the Realest"" mabey ""the World is Mine"" can be in the best of this album. Im into gangsta rap, and gangsta rappers Mack 10, Yukmouth, Gangsta Pat dont do love songs, especially more than 5 slow jams on 1 cd. sounds like hes trying to make songs for the radio or whatever, I do not reccomend this cd, it is not worth it."
3,Worked ok,"this helped my girlfriend during a time that she was suffering back/leg pain caused by psiatica. The attachment to the toilet didn't work for our toilet, but just setting it on the toilet bowl work OK (it slipped around a little, which took some getting used to)."
1,no u bolts,"dont be fooled by the picture there are no u bolts that come with this ""kit"". change the picture and me it less deceiving and the product would be fine"
5,The more things change...,"Allen does not limit himself to the ""great man"" school of history, but gives a wide-ranging and colorful view of a decade disquietingly like the 90s/00s - a careening stock market, a failing war on drugs, and oil company execs in to clean up the White House. This book would get five stars for the Prohibition poem alone: ""...it doesn't prohibit worth a dime/Nevertheless, we're for it!"" One of the most interesting parts was what Allen doesn't - and couldn't - write about. Only Yesterday was written in 1931, before the full effects of Versailles had been felt. Viewed in that light, Allen's portrait of Wilson, while romanticized, astutely outlines why Wilson's ideas for the peace treaty were wise, and why they were so unlikely to ever be realized. From hemlines to geopolitics, Allen pulls it all together in a fascinating book."
5,A throughly excellent historical reference,"This is exactly the type of history book I like to read. The subject matter is brought to life in a way simply not found in other authors. It reminded me quite a bit of Howard's Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States"" because I read that first and I wonder if Professor Zinn took a hint from Mr. Allen's style because they are very similar.I will remember events, people and places in this book long after I am done reading it (for a college class) simply because of the way the author seems to be talking directly to you.It is as if you are just sitting down for dinner, or a chat, and he's laying out the 1920's to you because you asked.I am throughly impressed with this book and I am glad my Professor exposed me to it. I recommend it to anyone who has ever wondered what the ""Roaring 20's"" were all about."
4,Only Yesterday,I am doing some research for a novel set in the 1920's. This book is very helpful in giving a favor of what the people in this time were thinking and some of the major events in this time.Someone looking for a more serious work may wish to broaden their research a bit to get more depth.
2,"Wow, this book is boring",From the view point of a sixteen year old who was assigned this book for school reading it is not very interesting. Although some things like prohibition and the womens rights are fun to read and learn about most of the book is so boring. Would not recommend.
1,Do not buy this!,I saw this on amazon and decided to get it for my dad for Christmas. Big mistake! It broke right away and takes 5 minutes of shaking for about 5 seconds of light. I'm not kidding! I read the reviews but I thought my dad would really like it so bought it anyway. Trust me: Do not buy this! You will regret it.
4,will work in a pinch,"Not the best flash light, fells a little cheap but will work. No more picking up a flash light that has no batteries."
1,Crap,This was a complete waste of money. It does not hold a charge for more than a couple of seconds.
1,flashlight,"Not a very bright light at all. My first order of lights did not work. I receivedreplacements very quickly, but not impressed at all. for the price, though, don'texpect much."
3,not ideal but will work,i agree with many of the responses listed here but one must understand that this is an incase of emergency flshlight not a light for daily activities or tactical purposes. for what they are and what you pay their totally worth it. the metal slide IS a magnet as well.
2,How does this thing worth,"While our flashlight seems to work, I can't help but notice that it has a lithium button battery, which might explain its function. The ""Magnet"" is actually a piece of lead. So how does it really work? Shaking it definatly increases the brightness, but it seems it is assisting the magnet."
2,need improvement,"With a lot of shaking, it produces very poor amount of light. I could barely see with it.They need to improve it."
1,poor quality,Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well. illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright. I would not purchase this item again.
3,Flashlight,It wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I received it. It's quite a bit smaller than what I was imagining. But it works and we will use it.
1,THIS IS A SCAM,"I am an electrical engineering student and I bought this to study the coil generator for a project I am doing. It turns out this is not a shake flashlight at all, and is powered by little batteries. The ""magnet"" is actually just a piece of non-magnetic metal. The ""coil"" is just gold colored paper. If you don't believe me, just screw off the top and look inside. You don't need to know a thing about electrical engineering to see that there are no wires going from the coil, or that it's made out of paper. This is a complete scam from china. Avoid at all costs."
2,Not good!!!!!!!,This item was purchased as a gift and I was very unhappy when I received the item. The box it came in was very bent up and the top of the box would not even close properly. The flashlight was missing the cord to hang it from and it was hard to get to work after following the directions. I would not buy this product again.
1,Shake flaslite,"In my clear opinion, this product is not worthed at all for any amount of money unless if you plan to spend more time shaking the flash light than using it..even after that the illumination is very short lasting and minimal. Buy Garrity 3 led flash light. It is worthed for the money."
1,This Item is a Fraud,"As noted in another review, this is not in fact a hand-powered flashlight. The 'coil' is a piece of foil and the 'magnet' is a piece of lead. The flashlight is actually powered by batteries. Save your money."
1,shake flashlight,This is junk if you keep shaking it back and forth it will flicker on but not stay on I think the dollar store has beeter items than this
2,Quality goes bad,"I must say I was a big fan of the seller till my very recent order, they quality dropped dramatically: 1) inside of the plastic bag (which contains the soybeans ) is flaky, dusty 2) after soaking the beans, I got many broken beans, bits and piece, not one piece 3) small amount of the beans stays hard and size did not change much after soaking over 8 hoursDue to these reasons, one should think twice before order."
2,Excessive price increase!,"I have bought from this company twice and was happy with the product and, originally with the price. However, when I was ready to buy more beans this year, I found that the price had gone up 50% over last year. Needless to say I switched to a company that also sold organic soybeans, but for 20% less than what they are selling for here. It pays to do your research.Sorry I had to switch providers, but you shouldn't gouge your loyal customers."
4,Taste wonderful,"If you use the soybeans to make soymilk, you would love it. The taste is just what I like . Try it."
3,"Okay, but....","I bought these beans for experimenting with homemade soy milk and tofu. The flavor is fine, but in 4 cups of soy beans, there is at least 1/4 cup of beans that will not absorb water. I don't know all the reasons that beans don't absorb water, but I will say that in trials with 4 other brands of soybeans, I have not seen this problem. I pick through the beans carefully in any case, it just makes the task more difficult when I have to pick out tiny round beans. Additionally, when the shipment arrived, the bag was unsealed completely, not so much as a twistie tie or knot in the bag."
1,Not as I expected,"Your bean is not as good as the other reviewers' description. There are some beans are rotten, molded, and have a dark colored shell of mold. How long have you had these beans? Do you check the quality of the beans periodically? I picked you from so many web sites and I am very disappointed."
2,not fresh,"The beens are good big size, but have mold. So I do not think the beens are fresh. I will not buy from them again. Because people buy organic food for safety and freshness.The seller let me return the beens and refund the money promptly."
1,Picture froze in last half of the movie,"Movie did great until scene selection 19. The picture froze. Couldn't get it to advance or reverse. I took it out and tried it in my other player, same thing. I then took it to my daughter's home and tried it there, same thing. I need to return it, but I have to go somewhere else and use someone's computer to do this. When I tried to do this from my home, the site said ""printer required"" and mine is not working. I bought several other movies and they all were good, so I am not unhappy with your service. I just hope the return goes well. I have several other purchases waiting in my cart that I will not buy until I see how this is resolved. Thank you."
2,I remember it being funnier.,"I recently purchased this movie because I remember watching it years ago when it first came out on VHS. Had some of my favorite comedians in it. I remembered it being hysterical but after viewing it recently, it didn't seem to have the comical effect of years gone by. Still a funny movie."
2,Not Louie Anderson's finest hour...,"I remember going to see this at the theater in 1988 when I was fourteen. Besides my dad and me, there were only two other people in the theater. They stood up and left halfway through. There was a good reason for this. This movie is very poor and I believe it only stayed in theaters for about a week before tanking. Good for nostalgia value only."
1,was i so wrong,I though the LA basketball wives might be a bit better but i was wrong. This is even worse than the other ones the women act like they are gods gift but they are just a waist of space so do not waist your money on this one. They should call it the Basketball's Trashy wives.
1,Poorly designed,"This phone is so poorly designed that I returned it after 1 month. The primary issues are ...(1) You always have to press the ""Talk"" button 3 times (not once) in order to get a dial tone.(2) When a voice message is waiting, the phone beeps loudly every 30 seconds. Very annoying when you let the phone take a message because you are preoccupied or have company visiting.(3) If you have the base wallmounted, the handset does not rest securely in the base -- Half the time it falls off when you set it down."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"This phone is c**p. It is outsourced to some company and bears the IBM logo, but the quality is low (like a lot of things manufactured in China). My battery died after 5 months and I cannot find a replacement. I talked to the company that manufactures this phone and they promissed me a replacement but I did not get it yet.The headset works only in one position. If the microwave is working in our house, I am getting static. Sometimes you would have to press a couple of times on the Talk button to get a tone.SKIP IT!"
1,worthless phone,"Speakerphone part works alright. If you get the handset to work you have to be right on top of the base unit, sometimes even then it will not work. The phone hangs up on you when trying to connect. You have to push the talk button four or five times just to try to get a line out. If a connection is made it is full of static. My rating would be a Negative 10 if they had that type of rating. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!"
1,Worthless and Useless,"Purchasing this telephone was a HUGE mistake. The battery died after six months and looking for a replacement battery is like trying to locate a needle in a haystack! When my microwave is in use; the telephone can't be in use - what's the connection? There is none! When a message is left, the telephone continues to beep every minute until the message is checked. The only purpose for this telephone: batting practice! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME - THIS TELEPHONE ISN'T WORTH IT!!"
5,CD Karen Kate Blackwell,Saw her in person about 15 years ago in Las Vegas NV. She gave a wonderful performance there is a song she wrote for her wedding vows called Wedding Vows that touched my heart and I purchased a tape of it but wore it out. When I went on Amazon and found CD had to have it. For all people getting married or who are married already I highly recommend it. Rest of CD isgreat also. Still looking for another release by her.
1,Where is Voyager?,Although I have enjoyed Carey's past Trek novels I found this one to be a bit dull. Voyager's strength is in its' ensemble cast. Writing an entire book around one character (Janeway) with no interaction with other crew members is a mistake. And why give so much attention to aliens? I thought a requirement for Trek novel publication was to adhere to Trek characters...not base an entire story on non Trek characters. If I buy a Star Trek book I want to read a story with STAR TREK CHARACTERS. Are you reading this Pocket Books?????
4,Dark Assumptions,"This was a pecuilar book compared to the earlier previous Captain Table's books- for starters, there were no interruptions with the secondary characters whatsoever. I was always curious as to see how a member of Voyager would cope with if the ship had been destroyed, or had left them behind. Janeway had to cope with a bizarre and completely alien situation- she was hurled from Voyager, stranded in space, rescued by the Omian, and finding out a baffling and puzzling conlifct while trying to stop the ""Meance-aka Lumalit"". The book also showed that Janeway was spoiled with command decisions, and had to work her way up. The book was much different that the other Captain's Table but brought more to offer on Janeway's behalf. This book was truly unique in that it showed a different side of the Captain in their unique journey home."
3,Nice to see Janeway for once not in command,"I generally don't like Captain Janeway and it was hard at first to get hang of her being the only one present, but this story was well written. Diane Carey is one of my favorite authors and I think she's done well again."
3,Good read - But that just isn't Janeway!,"I actually enjoyed this book as long as I blocked out the fact that it was supposed to be Janeway this all happened to. It seemed very much out of character for her and just didn't mesh well with what we know of her.I was constantly overcome with the feeling that this book was written for someone else or with someone else as the main character initially.I like the unique approach to the alien's technology and the immediacy of the hazards they faced in space. So often we forget, in the Star Trek universe, that SPACE is lurking just outside those graceful hulls.The lady in this story is tough, smart and capable and eventually proves it to her new crew, the author just didn't make me feel like it was Janeway. All her innate dignity seemed to be ignored.Good read, just not really Janeway."
2,diane carey could do alot better,"the ""fire ship"" actualy goes down in flames. the beginning of the book isn't understandable and doesn't match the tv episodes in any way. the story itself isn't fluent and doesn't catch the reader. the book could have been writen as a reguler book with more success and not as a ""captain's table"" episode. it misses the actual atmosphere of a story told in a bar (e.g. ""the mist""). the book is also acompanied with many spelling and grammer erorrs. i hope carey will do better with her next book."
4,One of the more original of the latest crop,"The Captain's Table series has been a pleasant surprise. Fire Ship with Kay Janeway getting back to basics is excellent. Some of her actions and words don't reflect what we've become accustom to from other books or the TV series. But it's a good diversion.If anything were wrong with it, I'd have to say that the ending was a little rushed. Lots of details in the first chapters but they dwindle in the later ones, left me wanting."
3,The best tale in the series so far,"This is the best `Captain's Table' novel so far I'm glad Diane Carey doesn't rely as much on the bar to jolt the reader in and out of the story, she merely uses the bar as a frame for Janeway's solo adventure; it's all the stronger for that. She gives Janeway her chance to shine and show her leadership colours under extraordinary circumstances.By no means a brilliant novel. I would have preferred an ensemble piece rather than a Janeway solo tale, but otherwise, an enjoyably pleasant book."
3,Original Thought for a Zombie Flick,"I can only give the movie 3 stars due to the Commandant & the X-Boyfriend. The ""C"" by any other name would still be a ""C"". Very stereotypical of a lesbian hate-monger, trying to prove that her balls are bigger than everyone else's. I've seen too many of the X in real life. Idiots like that need to die.Onto the movie...Outside of the above mentioned, I enjoyed it. The support group was great. Every emotion was brought out in there. The donuts & coffee were an unexpected treat. I dont understand why every movie that has racism (dead-ism?), hatred & bigotry needs an American flag in those scenes. Because I have one on the front of my house make me a racist?If you're looking for nudity, you'll have to go to the deleted scenes for that. Otherwise, good movie that had the potential to be great."
3,another marc fratto film worth seeing,"Zombies Anonymous is a great idea for a romantic comedy horror flick, because it's not overly directed or acted. The gore effects were very well done, and it was an entertaining film."
2,Original thought,"This movie had an original idea, but lact so much for being a zombie movie. At times it was just stupid! Another zombie movie id pass on. Doubt I'll be re-watching this movie any time soon!"
5,One of the best albums of the 90's,"This is an incredibly moving album. No-man somehow finds a way to fuse the rich, effusive sound of ornate progressive rock with the intimacy and timelessness of classic English folk (thing of Talk Talk's later years, David Sylvian, or Nick Drake). This sacrifices nothing from the best of both genres and remains a high water mark in the catalogs of Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree) and Tim Bowness. Guest appearances from Robert Fripp, Mel Collins, and Lisa Gerrard only enhance the music and never sound gratuitous. Wilson, of course, has gone on to great acclaim in Porcupine Tree, but the fans should pay particular attention to Mr. Bowness, whose sensibility brings a very different emotion to this music. Music for the sake of music with no compromises."
3,Gorgeous power pop with seriously annoying vocals,"For Porcupine Tree fans:Move along, nothing to see here. This is not a Porcupine Tree album by a different name. Get one track: ""things change,"" if you must.For everyone else:Glossy power pop, beautifully recorded. Mike and the Mechanics would be proud of this. (That's not intended as a criticism.)The loss of two stars comes from the affected, breathy vocals. They get seriously annoying after a couple of tracks.Steven, if you're listening, how about an instrumental version, or one with you singing? That would be much better."
3,"NICE, BUT NOT GREAT","Three and a half stars, actually.High expectations are a dangerous thing. I ordered this CD with very high ones after buying (and liking a lot) several Steven Wilson-related CDs, Porcupine Tree is in my top five, Blackfield is very nice artsy pop music, so what did I have to lose. Honestly, I do like the album, it does remind me -in addition of those influences already mentioned- of early Tears for Fears and late Talk Talk. In my opinion the vocals are too even, too ""the same"", and that's what takes away the most from the album.I found the bonus material a bit boring, meandering and pointless. Something for the fans only.Overall the album is good, gives you a hint of much better and greater things to come from Wilson."
5,Considers the written and archealogical records together.,"A very even-handed account of Sub-Roman Britain. Beginning with a review of the contemporary written sources, the author provides a new and insightful method of studying this Dark Age society through their use of common and important words such as ""civitas"" and ""tyranni"".After getting the most from the few written works available from both inside and outside Britain, the second half of the book considers the archealogical record of period. This part alone is an excellent overview of the latest knowledge which the archealogist's trowel has been able to bring to bear on the period. Orgainized in categories such as cities and religious sites, the book considers Sub-Roman patterns of site usage throughout the country rather than focusing on a site-by-site survey.Very accessible reading which leaves you wishing for more."
5,A must read for anyone interested in post Roman Britain,Dr. Snyder provides an exellent view of the development of early Britain. He begins his study with the departure of Rome from the Island. He goes on to describe the stages through which the britons travel to reach into the early medievil world. This is a period of british history which is to often overlooked. The world of sub-Roman Britain is one that is full of a great deal of important historical development. Not only would I recomend this to all British historians I would also counsel any people with an interest in history in general to give this a read. If given the chance to hear this author speak I would encourage taking advantage of a great oppertunity.
4,England at the end of the Romans time to the coming of anglo-saxon,"Not knowing much about this period, I was quite interested to find out more on this era.This book gives us an over view of what is known of the time. I was stunned to find how little is known of this time. What we do know is that the period went though some dramatic changes? However how we don't know. There are unfortunately few written sources of the period and the archaeologist have little at present to help us."
4,good value,"For less than a dollar a roll, this tape is a very good value. It mid-weight; not the strongest on the market, but not the flimsiest either. It applies pretty easily without wrinkling like cheap tapes often do. I bought it direct from Amazon and I did receive 6 rolls of tape for less than six dollars with free Prime shipping.The label on the package says ""Made in China for 3M"", so the Amazon's claim of ""Made in USA"" is apparently false."
1,Low Quality Packing tape,"I pack and ship items on a daily basis. I bought this tape to seal my packages. It was cheap (so yay for price), but extremely low quality. It will not adequately seal a cardboard mailer without many layers. Even then, I worry that the package will open in transit.Lesson learned. Next time I will pay more for a higher quality product."
1,Volume too Low,"I bought this product to put in my work truck. I was having issues of hearing my cell phone with volume. I was not able to clearly hear the phone, music, or GPS. I saw this item on amazon. It was exactly what I needed. I was small and compact with plenty of power. I was so excited when it arrived. What I got was a big and bulky speaker. No problem. I can adapt. I can still mount it in my work truck. I did just that. I put it next to my head rest. Now the moment of truth. I turned the phone all the way up. I plugged in the speaker. What a disappointment. I found no difference in the volume. This wonderful speaker made no difference in the amount of volume. In fact I'm not sure if the phone speaker was not louder. I disconnected the speaker and threw it into my shop. What a piece of poop!"
1,Did not get the one which was shown in the picture,"Dear Manager,I ordered this product after viewing the picture, but was disappointed to receive that it wasn't the one which I ordered for...Zulfiqar"
1,Received wrong Item,"Dear Amazon;I placed this order pictured above; Cobra HG S300 and I received a Cobra S300 instead. I have been greatly to all lengths dissappointed in the handling of this situation. I requested for UPS to come to my house (call tag) to pick this wrong item up and did not get any results from it. Therefore, I Will No longer place another order from ya'll again. If I had received the correct order, I probably would have been a satisfied customer, but like I said, I am greatly dissappointed and would not recommend ordering from amazon. SORRY!!!!"
2,Item picture is not representative of what you will actually receive,"The speaker is great, but it looks nothing like the picture included with the item description. There is really nothing about that photo that is even remotely similar. I don't know if I got an earlier version of this speaker or what. Amazon really needs to correct the photo on this item."
1,sent wrong speaker,Speaker they sent was a cheap imatation. A real letdown from amazon. They should change the picture.
3,Not as Pictured - Good Product,"I must say that I decided on this item over others because of how cool the picture made it look. I received a MUCH uglier product, however the sound output is great so I decided to keep it. The product I received was an ugly beige/silver square with no cobra logo. If you are going to put this in the floor area of your car, go for it. The sound is great."
3,studio stuff best,"The studio songs are the best thing on here. I'm a Stones freak. And I love SEEING them live. I've never experienced any energy as I have when the Stones come out on stage. But, oddly, I don't like the way they SOUND live. They are so untight, and sound nothing like their studio albums. They're famous as a live band. Because of Mick's energy. But his energy distracts you from their mediocre sound. This album is representative of that."
5,Best Music In Years,This is a refreshing live performance of some of the Rolling Stones best songs in years. It is a pleasure to listen to.
3,Flash The Cash,Kudos for putting out live versions of Paint It Black and Ruby Tuesday. Some of the other songs sound as if they've been doing them for the millionth time.
3,Another live Stones CD,"Nothing new with this CD from a live stand point. The true gem on this CD is the new cut ""Highwire"". It was made to be the new anthum of the Gulf War, like ""Paint it Black"" was for Vietnam. Worth it for ""Highwire"" alone."
2,I just read all of the reviews here....,"...and I CANNOT BELIEVE that no one mentioned the coolest/sketchiest thing about this album: the lyrical re-working of Brown Sugar, in which Mick says things like, ""...just like a black boy should"", and ""...just like a young man should"".Priceless."
1,Sound quality is weak.,This concert recorded cd does not do justice to the band's songs. Sound is poor.
5,I Just Can't be Seen with You,"Keith's gritty voice really does it for me. I love seeing and hearing the Stones Live. This was one of their better tours in my mind, but then they just kept on getting even Bigger & Better. After I got my California Real Estate License in 1994 I started taking my clients to Live concerts in Limos. What better way to thank them for Buying a house from me, than to be able to Party all the way over the Bay Bridge and back going to to hear the Rolling Stones!!"
4,Why did I wait?,"I've left this sit on the shelf for years.What a mistake, but better now then never.A must for your Stone catalogue."
2,Burnout,"Oh yeah, THAT's what we all wanted: another live Stones album! The band's in okay form, albeit somewhat passionless, but the song selections (yet more retreads of Brown Sugar, Jumping Jack Flash, Satisfaction et al) are unimaginative in the extreme. Pretty darn unnecessary, when it comes down to it."
2,Doctor in the House,"The album was originally released in 1983 and found Edgar Froese working within highly-textured soundscapes, with a focus on rich melodies.This 2005 reissue is unfortunately an ""updated"" version by Froese, as he took what was one of his most solid efforts and tweaked the music. As controversial as this process has been with Tangerine Dream, Froese has jumped into the blueprint for change with his solo catalog.While Froese has constantly shown an evolving artistry, the original four numbers - clocking 43:09 - were fascinating in what they represented in their original form (which was some of the best music by Froese). An important work is muddled, which shows - again - that all change is not good."
2,Scream scream scream scream!!!!,He is a hell of a screamer and thats it!! Boring improvisations and a thin sound!! The band is quite good thoug...
3,Good for an opposing view,Is provides a contrarian view on North Korea but appears biased. I would recommend it for anyone seeking to round out a DPRK research library.
4,A great party CD,"Purchased this cd on the strength of Feel Alright a (Jagger/Richards cover), that someone played for me.Now I have pleasantly found many better songs to listen too.It moves between blues and rock pretty easy.If you want a good party cd buy this, cd makes a good companion to The Yardbirds.But I do agree with previous reviewer mastering is only average, a real shame.4 stars for album.3 for mastering."
3,"Why ""highlights""?","The remastering of Peter Gabriel's back catalog is a welcome and long-overdue development. But why, oh why, would they omit four tracks from the original ""Plays Live"" (rating: 4 stars) in order to fit the material on a single CD? Let's face it, casual fans are going to stick to ""Secret World Live"" (5 stars). Anyone interested in this older Gabriel live album (recorded during the ""Security"" tour, prior to ""So"") is likely to be a serious fan... and serious fans are going to want the complete edition, particularly since the four tracks omitted are not the weakest tracks. ""The Rhythm of the Heat,"" the set opener, is particularly prominent in its absence. Condensing this release was a poor decision, no doubt made to keep the cost of the CD down in order to increase sales, but in the end, it will probably means fewer sales. I'm holding out for the complete edition. (Postscript: The complete edition is now available as an import from Japan.)"
4,Excellent Live Slice of Early Gabriel,"Peter Gabriel & his crew perform good to great versions of sixteen of his songs in front of an oddly receptive Midwest US audience (many of whom were possibly there to hear ""Shock the Monkey"" then go home). Some of the songs benefit from live treatment - ""Rhythm of the Heat"" is especially powerful, as is ""Biko"". ""I Go Swimming"" (a rather rare song in the Peter Gabriel canon) gets a good treatment, and both ""DIY"" and ""San Jacinto"" sound great. Other songs don't change much from their LP counterparts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but then again, it does render them rather redundant. I'm not entirely sure exactly what ""cheating"" was done to spruce up these recordings (if I had to guess, it was to clean up some pre-recorded rhythms), but the end result still sounds ""live"". All in all, an enjoyable listening experience if you've got the time."
4,San Jacinto.......,"To me, the song San Jacinto alone makes this one of the great live albums of all time. Being a long time Gabriel fan does skew my perspective somewhat and I was there live at his concert stop from that tour in Kansas City, but sometime, if you dare, turn off all of your lights and just listen to this song and see if you get chills like I do everytime I hear this song again."
3,"Some good moments, but disappointing","Gabriel's work during this period was becoming more dense, more intricate and exact. He'd been playing with synthesizers for a couple of years and started to compose music that relied on atmosphere rather than standard chord progressions (call it ""modal rock""). This album shows Gabriel and his band stripping the compositions to the bone for simpler live execution. On the more generic songs (DIY, I Don't Remember, On the Air) it works. Unfortunately, the same process turns some tracks into semi-disco mush, complete with grating synth drums and fake piano. Not as engaging as ""Secret World Live"", but the versions of Intruder and Family and the Fishing Net compensate for the album's flaws."
1,Only one disc (Disc 2),Beware:People are advertising this product and only delivering beat up copies of Disc 2 only.Caveat Emptor!Buyer Beware.
5,The passion and power captured for posterity,"Plays Live is everything a concert album should be but rarely is, a true reflection of the live experience. Peter Gabriel's concerts are filled with power and this CD captures this experience much more successfully than the later Secret World CD. Incredible performances and an involved but not intrusive audience make this a definite necessity for anyone who has been to a Gabriel performance. Scratch that, it's a necessity for any fan of Gabriel's music."
1,Not Reliable,"After about two years this weather radio has finally broken. All I get is static on everything. I called Oregon Scientific and they said there is only a one year warranty. While it worked, it was good but did not receive every warning or watch. Just bought the WR103 and hopefully that works better."
1,Died Quickly,"It quit working completely after a couple months. Of course this was after the warranty ran up. It was used very little if at all during those months. Must have been defective, but what can I do now except buy another one, which i won't."
1,Hard to Program,This product has the most difficult programming instructions I have ever seen. Even changing the clock time (which you have to do 2X per year) proves to be a major challenge requiring the manual. The manual also must have been translated from Chinese as it is also difficult to understand...even for someone like myself with a technical degree! I tossed the product out after 6 months.
3,Just speaker wire,"Nothing speacial, nothing bad, just plain old copper wire with plastic around it. Love that it was cheap though!"
1,bling bling,"man, this album is phat. the title track, ""F the BS"", and ""Buttermilk Bisquick"", have more sweet raps than all of p-diddy's albums put together. mix-a-lot has been dropping tricked-out heat rocks longer than anyone in the biz, and it shows on this record. he has elevated himself to the level of Abraham Lincoln, Ghandi, and Hitler with his pure genius. nothing on earth has ever touched me in such a way as this sweet album. ever since i picked up the 12"" lp ... i have been a better person. rap on, mixy, rap on, and let those B.G.'s eat your dust, you loc-ed out O.G.holla"
2,Problem with my order,I really like the movie because of the music--I have seen it before--the picture on this tape was ok--though it has a couple of skips in it--the big problem is the audio--it is really low--I have to have my tv on full volume to almost hear it. I did not complain because I'm sure it is not your fault--you just sell the merchandise that is provided to you. The ordering went smooth and I received it promptly.
1,Could Have Been Much Better,"What happened to the Chess Brothers? Was it just Leonard Chess? NO it was not. Can't stand when right from the start they get it wrong. At least mention the guy. And speaking of the guy - what happened to Buddy Guy and Bo Diddley? I guess Phil Chess took care of them. I would have liked to see some complete performances, especially of Muddy Waters. There are too many musicians represented here that deserve a movie of their own. How can so many movies be made this way. They know the facts, but refuse to make it right. What bothers me is that someone makes a conscious effort to do so.I like the music, but I'm not grading the music, I'm grading the storyline - 1 star."
2,Epic. If You Mean Epically Bad.,"I hated Cadillac Records but I stayed with it for the soundtrack and the hope that it would get better. Len Chess isn't the only paternalistic thing about this film. A mishmash timeline of race cliches and lazy storytelling, Cadillac Records can't even be bothered to get it's facts straight. Saving it from one star are the performances of Columbus Short, Mos Def and Eamonn Walker, all of whom are far better than the material deserves. The film provides about as much context as a 1950's Looney Tunes featuring celebrities of the day. Even if one allows for the need to condense a large story into a short time frame, have some continuity of character inside the abbreviated version. Disjointed, relying on race role tropes instead of characterization, Cadillac Records is a lazy film that does a disservice to all whom it portrays."
3,Cadillac Records,Video and sound are off. It's like that thru half of the movie. Some times it straightens out. Sometimes not
2,paternalism w/o character development,"The music was good. The people seemed real but skin-deep: booze, drugs, guns, stupidity, self-destructive violence and instant sex. There's no depth to any of the characters. The question remains how can you make a movie with Chess treating his artists like children financially (read"" PATERNALLY), but the movie doesn't make clear if he is scamming them or not. Muddy Waters doesn't seem to have a clue what money is his and how much and why. Chess buys him a car as if he's an empty-headed girlfriend, and as such gets paid with whatever Chess decides to give him. Etta James decides he ""loved her"" because he left her the deed (doesnt say mortgage is paid off) of a house that cost in 1970 (year Chess died) about $35,000. Chess sold his company for over $6,000,000, and that doesnt count the millions he made on the way up. In short, they had an opportunity to make a complex character, and instead make a superficial and (almost boring) one."
2,The classic problem,"If the passion for the music had been sustained in the presentation of the tale, this would have been a transcendent picture. Had even half the energy employed in fabrication of events and relationships been turned to representation, this picture could have been great.As it stands, it is merely OK, and an insult to those who it alleges to portray. Hopefully the high production values, and loving attention paid to the music will serve as the first step on a road of discovery for newcomers, not the last."
4,Cadillac Records,"This is a very dark, I suspect, realistic story of the very early days of a part of the music business. The prejudice the African American artist had to fight, the struggle to be taken into the record fold.It was a very difficult life they led, leading to drugs, violence, etc, the language is rough,...BUT, it is very interesting, and the music is amazing. Beonce is a perfect Etta James, maybe even better than Etta herself !!!"
5,Excellent service!!!,I received my shipment of this Blu-ray disc in excellent condition and in record delivery time. Thanks!
5,Great History Lesson,This movie made me appreciate all of the sacrafices made to simply entertain others. I loved Beonyce's portrayal of Etta James.
4,Cadillac Records,"The movie was informative as a history of the blues but did leave a few things unanswered.Overall it was a good movie and if you like the blues, the music is very good."
4,Liked it More than I Thought I Would.,"I'm not a huge blues fan, I bought the movie because I like Adrien Brody. But I really enjoyed the story and the music. The history lesson was great and I'll be listening to more blues."
4,enjoyed it!,"Good movie, I enjoyed the music a lot. Husband really liked it and bought it through amazon instant video. Would recommend."
5,Seminal Film,"Details the birth of the urban blues in Chicago, and who made it happen. Brody is terrific as the blues impressario, Leonard Chess, and Jeffrey Wright's Muddy is definitive. Mos Def almost out-Chucks the real Chuck Berry, and Beyonce's Etta is strong and credible. To be watched over and over!"
4,good feeling,very good movie with good actors the true story of the bluesmen is not here and credible but it's a very good fiction !
5,Quick delivery and as described!,"Excellent fictionalized account of the history of Chess Records and its stars. If you like the blues, you will will enjoy this DVD. If you love the blues, makes you go and dust off your oldies and goodies."
1,disapointed,"I was delighted with the early arrival then schedule of this DVD. However I didn't enjoy it at all. I was hoping to here the original songs of Etta James and the acting wasn't that good either, which made for a boring movie."
1,Pure trash,"This lap desk is a joke. As the other reviews indicate, it is very flimsy. The pads are not comfortable. We simply threw the lamp away. We tried to return the desk, but were given a full credit for the cost and told to keep the desk, so you might say in the end we paid what it was worth."
2,Not as nice as the picture looked,The quality was less than I expected. The pillow on the back does not keep the lap desk secure and the pen/pencil holder set into the top right side gets in the way when writing. I saw a better one at Linens n' Things for $9.99. I did receive it right away and was happy with the delivery time.
2,Not As High-Quality As Pictured...,"I don't mind paying extra money for something that's worth it. This lap desk was a disappointment. However, I've tried to use it anyway.The pencil box that's built in is a joke. You can fit about 2 pencils in it. Forget trying to fit thicker pens in there because the door won't close.After about 1 month of use the bean bag padding underneath the desk split open so I have all these tiny white balls falling out which are impossible to vacuum ALL of them up. They're everywhere. In my bed. All over the carpet. I even saw one on my dog's lip the other day...just when I thought I finally go them all up.When shopping for an item like this, you may want to go to an actual store and get it so you know what you're buying and can determine the durability. Also, NEVER get one of these desks with the ""bean bag"" substance in them because if it ever rips open, you'll have these white balls in your life forever."
3,A Classic?,"I picked this up because it's listed on nearly every Graphic Design reading list. Reviews rave about it and call it a classic. At the risk of sounding like a philistine, I don't get it.There's a nice little intro by Armin Hoffman, where he touches on some of the core elements to visual design (dots, line, contrast, letters). After that, it's approximately 150 pages of black & white form studies. You get out of it what you put into it, I suppose.Also, the price of this book is a little ridiculous. It's a basic softcover with black & white printing coming in at less than 200 pages."
4,Bible of graphic design???,"Even though Armin Hofmann has made a grand contrubution to the design world, I surely don't consider this book as a beginners manual. The one book that I can only consider to open the beginners horizon is ""A History of Graphic Design"" by Philip B. Meggs. In the long run, this is a good book, but not for the freshman."
3,Meade's second career,"Meade Lux Lewis had some success in the late 1920s with his signature piece, ""Honky Tonk Train Blues,"" after which he retired from any musical activity. During the boogie woogie revival of the mid-30s, John Hammond of COLUMBIA records sought out Lewis-- he was working in a Chicago carwash. Hammond convinced Meade Lewis to reenter the recording studio, and thus his second and more successful career was launched. Lewis continued working in clubs until 1964, when a car crash took his life.The fourteen 78 sides on MEADE LUX LEWIS 1939-1954 are primarily solo piano-- the last three tracks are live performance radio transcriptions with Lewis augmented by a small group. Most of the solo tracks unfortunately have surface imperfections: ticks, pops, whoosh and clicks. Frequency range is limited, as well. Liner notes are scant. A so-so set by an above average pianist.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 44:16"
2,Save Your Money,"I am in the process of looking to return. The seal is not so good, so you have to run it through the machine a couple of times. In addition, the lamination has ridges in it. It isn't a smoothe finish (and it isn't air pockets??)"
1,Not Durable,"My wife used hers no more than 4 times and it burned up. She was not using very heavy at one time. This unit was just not up to standards we set, but for the money, I guess you get what you pay for.Invest in a more expensive unit."
3,PL100,The machine is very sensative. It jams very easily. I used it once and had to send it back to the manufactor for repairs. I still dont have it back yet.
2,back to regular razor,"this razor did not work right from the time i received it. it wont cut right, leaves hair, leaves rough spots. if i would of kept the box, i would of sent it back. bad choice for me."
2,Battery pack went dead,"It seemed like a good deal... at the time. The main reason I got this was because the DA-307's trimmer tends to break where the pins are, allowing the trimmer to pop out of the unit. I have two older units with the same problem, so thought a relatively inexpensive replacement would be a good try. However, after six months of use the battery pack went dead. I was able to swap the battery pack from a much older unit and my version of ""reconditioning"" now works great. One has to ask: what reconditioning was done at the factory if the battery pack died in just SIX months? Avoid this product and just buy a new one... or live with your old one as is."
2,Gordon therapy recipes,Not what I expected. Done by someone else quality was poor print was poor was not put together well at all
3,diet for health,"I cannot deny this is an interesting book for health and how to keep healthy, but you would have to be able to afford the products and I was not able to keep up with the recipes only because of the costs. I recommend seeing the video on the author's father. very interesting."
3,If you bought the healing the Gerson way you don't need this book,"I gave this book a 3 star rating due to the small print that the recipes are printed. My mom who is only 49 can't read this print. And there is nothing special about this book. If you bought the healing the Gerson way book, you don't need this one. I bought it for my mom, but I guess I should have typed up the recipes in the "" healing the Gerson way"" in larger print for my mom to read, and that would have been perfect. The font is hard to read as well as hard to see due to 12 point font."
2,did not like,"not what i thought it would be, not for me could be for you, read description very carefully, make sure before you purchase - not to waste money"
3,"Scant book, few pages, good recipes","Got book in great condition and in a timely manner, however, book very thin, just several pages thick- thought price was rather high for such a limited book."
4,Gerson Therapy Recipes,I bought the book: The Gerson Therapy. It's a nutritional program for cancer and other illnesses. I truly believe what we ingest in our bodies will either benefit our health or destroy it. The Gerson Therapy Recipes gives recipes that go along with the book. You need both books to get the full benefit.
1,Home made book,Disappointed looking for a published book on the diet and this was someones home made version of the Gerson diet not a published book.
3,It's not that great,"The drive worked fine, and lasted for a long time. In fact, when it finally started to break down, I was still able to use it. That was really nice, because I was able to recover data I didn't have backed up. But what bothered me is that ever since I got the drive, it kept making a weird clicking noise. Not your regular ""drive is about to break down"" noise, it was a squealing noise, followed by a click. Yet every drive scan I ran showed there was nothing wrong. So I don't know what the deal was, but that bothered me, as I constantly lived in fear that my drive was about to break down."
4,Out of print - get while you can,"I have the first song on the album on tape from March 1993 (the radio station I recorded the song from well lost in the dust). Good album!If you like Cause & Effect, you won't find this album in stores. It is 'discontinued by the manufacturer.' Unless you favor ""You Think You Know Her"" song, you don't know what you will get.It doesn't sound quite like any given Depeche Mode song, but may be in a similar genre.Unless you really know what you are buying, I would say pass, especially if the price tag is high."
4,"Oh, yeah! The ""Coriolanus effect""!","This one isn't really ""science fiction,"" since, with only changes, it could be set in the here-and-now, or in Ruritania -- but it's pure Heinlein, and better written than many of his earlier works. At only 128 pages, it's also pretty short for a novel -- but it works. Lorenzo Smyth (a/k/a Larry Smith) is an actor convinced of his own talent (which, as it turns out, is actually considerable) who is hired to impersonate the Good Guy leader of a major political alliance, who has been kidnaped on Mars by the Evil Opposition. Against his better apolitical judgment, Lorenzo takes the job because it's a challenge, and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely. There's a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort Heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions, with the quietly-made exception of a plea for racial tolerance."
4,Enjoyable old-school Heinlein,"For a book that was written over 50 years ago, it's a fine read. It's cool to read sci fi from back then since it wasn't as accepted a genre as it is now. I rather like Lorenzo's character and his thoughts. There's a bit of acting advice here that real-life actors could actually use. Some people might decry the implausibility of the plot, but we need to remember the time and content that this story was written in. While I LOVE the Lazarus Long books, I have found Heinlein's older works to be a treat as well. If you're a Heinlein fan, read this. If not, you might still enjoy it. Just keep in mind that this was written in the 50's, so much of our technology (current) outpaces what is in the book. It's interesting to see Lorenzo do his best to be a double, and starting to enjoy it and care about the role rather than just seeing it as a job."
3,"Mmmm.......okay book, not great, but not bad.","I'm a big Heinlein fan but the book is not always entertaining. Most of the time though. The book is good, not very hard to put down but it takes alot of work! His Martians in the book are so ridiculous (In a GOOD way). You just have to like this book. This would be more of a cult book, not very but if you hate politics, dont even try reading this book. But I liked it."
3,"Good, But Not Great","I like the book, I did. However, I can't see how it deserved to win the Hugo Award in 1956. I've begun to read all of the nominees and winners of the Hugo and Nebula awards since their inception. While this book is the best I have read so far, I remain continually amazed at the quality and content of the books from that era (1948-1956). It clearly was a different time and mindset.I did enjoy this book, I can not deny that. While it did not enrapt me, I was very curious to turn the page. But, when all was said and done, this book did not move me in any meaningful way, nor leave me with any new thoughts. I wouldn't quite call the book forgettable. In fact, as I was reading it I had some deja vu, and wondered if I had not read this once sometime in my past. But, it's not a story that makes me want to come back and read it again in the future. Your mileage may vary. :-)"
4,A good book but like most heinlein's books,"to surmise, the book is about an actor who is hired to be a political figure.I will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot.I felt that like some of heinlein's books, the book is plauged withpolitics, less science fiction, the only sci-fi thing about it is that the plot takes place in space, other than that, it's all politics.Same thing with Citizen of the galaxy, a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray sci-fi rather it shows heinlein's knowledge in law.I felt that the book could have been much better and i don't see how it won the Hugo award.Conclusion: The book is a fun pass, but nothing more. don't expect any groundbreaking plot, or jaw dropping plot twists, just your old fashioned politicians-dear-diary."
2,banal and dated,This Hugo award winning novel shows its age. Characters are using slide rules and fingerprints to prove their points. Not to mention the Martians running around Earth and Mars. Very talky not much else going on. Lots of fiction very little science or imagination. More of a character study of a man's blossoming from a self-centered oaf to a world leader. Really a pretty basic fish out of water becomes a hero story. Not a whole lot of literary value here. I consider this book a waste of time. Not even a good escape novel.
5,A lesser-known classic Sci-Fi from the Dean.,"Okay, you've got to step aside one moment when you sit down to this book and remember two things: One, this was not written for adults, but instead teenagers. Two, this book was written FOREVER ago. (Mind you, it's still an enjoyable novel to me now, and I'm almost thirty, living in the 21st century.)My father came to me one day when I was in the seventh grade and said that he thought it was time I read Heinlein. This was the first of the books he gave me, and I literally took it, read the first sentence, sat down where I was, and started reading.Like most of RAH's work, this book provides a pleasant, entertaining narrative while making you think about some of the issues within-- racism, politics, professionalism, and personal responsibility."
3,Just entertaining,"I know that Robert Heinlein is one of the masters of sci fi, and I know that this book won the Hugo award in 1957. I know that it is considered a classic, but for some reason it didn't strike me as anything great. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely entertaining. In fact, if Hollywood is looking for a good story, this book would make a great movie. But as literature I just found it a little uninspired. Maybe I was expecting something else. But if you just want a good read and are just looking for entertainment I am sure you'll enjoy the book. If you like your sci fi with a little more depth, try ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" or one of Heinlein's other books"
4,Not Heinlein's Best...,"...but then even Heinlein's worst is still pretty good. A nice, enjoyable afternoon's diversion that any Heinlein fan can appreciate."
5,Loved the turns and twist,I love Science Fiction but the turns and twists and political views in this book were great. I have read and reread this book numerous times over the years.
4,"Heinlein did better, later","""Double-Star"" is very good fiction. It was written in the 1950s, but is set in the future (with rocket ships and space travel), thus it is ""science-fiction"". However, the core of the tale has to do with human psychology.An out-of-work actor agrees to become a stand-in for a politician for a few days, on Mars. The politician gets sicker. The actor plugs on, winning an election for a high office for the polician. And, things get stickier and stickier and stickier.It was and still is a very good story. For Heinlein, this tale rates ""above average"" (in my opinion). For writers as a whole, Heinlein's ""average"" rates four stars, at least, and has won SF's highest award."
3,"good, but...","This is a well-written, well-plotted story, as you would expect from such a respected author.BUTPersonally, I have a problem with the story. The man character looses his individuality, becoming someone else. The (explicitly stated, too) message is that the trade-off was worth it - rather than being another unsuccesfull actor, the protagonist has become a significant political personality and can carry on realising his original's vision.This does not go well with any notion of the individual human being's intrinsic worth and I'm surprised that no one else seems to be troubled by this.Still, a very good and diverting read.The snapshots of a Martian culture are particularly memorable."
5,Double Star - a political treatise,"Okay, I love anything, mostly, by RAH but this is one of my favorites. It has action, politics, intrigue, and it is way too often overlooked by science-fiction lovers. Get it, read it, enjoy it."
3,3 and 1/2 Stars,"This is a Heinlein, so it is worth reading. It's an interesting story, with a unique plot (for science fiction) at least, and is a politically charged work, for those who like that side of Heinlein. In reality, this book could easily exist outside the genre of science fiction, so readers who don't normally like SF might dig this book. That said, this isn't one of Heinlein's best stories. There is almost no science whatsoever (not that unusual for RAH, but alas), the dialogue isn't up to his usual standards, and the story never really picks up steam like you expect it to.So, all in all, this is a book for the Heinlein devotee to pick up after they have already read most of his best work, an RAH newbie should look elsewhere. A good book, but I can't see why it won a Hugo."
2,Boring Academic Essays,"This book has two main sections. The first deals with Darwin and his views on science and religion. The second addresses a motley group of issues, such as the relation of religion to biology, and early opinions about evolution. Unfortunately, there is little in this book to interest most readers. The creation/evolution debate is barely covered at all, except to a slight degree in the last chapter. Most of the contributers do not specialize in either science or religion, and write with the assumption that their readers think as they do. The result is a boring book with little to say about anything, and of interest to few outside of narrow academic circles. Those interested in the creation/evolution debate should go elsewhere for their reading."
4,Works great - but had to change router settings first,"I purchased this on Ebay and had to play around with it a little to get it to work with my Tivo & router. I have a Medialink wireless router, and I had to change the security mode on the router by disabling the WPA. I have to play around with it to see if it will work with another setting, but thought I'd mention it to heads up others who think this will always be a plug & play scenario. I don't like my Wifi signal just being out in the open, so I'll have to remedy that, but I admit it was awesome seeing TIVO update so quickly and not have to manually plug it into the phone jack."
1,Works Great!!! For about 2 months.,"I installed this wireless network adapter on my desktop (windows xp). It worked very well for two months, then just unexpectedly died. I would try to reinstall it several times off the product CD, each time telling me a different file was missing, even though the files appeared to be installed (at least I could see them in on my hard drive). Downloaded the drivers from the Belkin website, but that also failed to get this thing to work. This adaper would be recognized by XP, detect the network signal, but it would always tell me ""connection failed"". Spend your money on a more robust wireless adapter."
2,Great Company - so-so product.. :-(,"It and it's companion FSD6130 WAP just never were able to talk to each other, even after a one-hour session with their techies.returned both units.."
1,Unstable causes sytem to crash in Mac OS 9 and 10,This product is a rip-off. It causes your system to be unstable and crash. I tried it using Mac OS 9.2.2 and 10.2.8.
3,Painful... unless your near the router.,"I dearly love the little box ^^but it's only worth having if you can be next to the router itself. The drop off point is terrible, the main place i use my laptop is upstairs (and the router is downstairs) i've even tried hanging the box over the banister rail but no use - it still disconnects anywhere from 1 minute to about 30 minutes (if i'm lucky).My advice is that this is good until you can afford to upgrade and your not actually going to be playing any online games or anything that requires the internet to be on constantly.My family have the wireless cards installed into their computers and they have no problems no matter where they are in the house. My next move is going to see if i can have a card installed some how, but until that day i guess i'll stick with the little black box with a strange temperment.It's actually good if your near the router itself, i just wish it was as good around the house.. i mean thats what a laptop's for right? moveability."
1,WinXP + WEP == Choose ANY other product than this one.,"First, the drivers packaged with this unit DID NOT WORK. Had to go to belkin.com and download the latest drivers (not the simplest thing to do without a functioning network adapter, eh?). While those drivers sort-of work, they are still extremely flaky. Not signed/certified by microsoft.I use WEP to secure my network... this device does not retain the WEP key/settings after a reboot. So, every single time you reboot, you have to re-enter the WEP key and manually start the driver utility.Signal is very weak - if the signal is lost for too long then the system will eventually hang and reboot itself.I've been a computer professional for the better part of 10 years now and I'm convinced that ANY product would be better than this Belkin POS. Avoid this product at any price."
1,Unreliable,"This piece of equipment has worked very poorly for us. It works seamlessly for days and even weeks and then suddenly will not work at all. There is no change in the environment that we are aware of, yet a good signal one day is just an impossible signal the next. It begins working again sometimes when we unplug and replug it, sometimes when we relocate the receiver, etc. It is the computer equivalent of hanging aluminum foil off your TV antennae. My husband is a computer professional but this does not have any user accessible parts so when it doesn't want to work, we are just at it's mercy. I wish we hadn't bought it."
2,Lousy 802.11 reception & transmission.,"I'm using this on a Win98SE PC to connect to an Apple AirPort Base Station. It sees the base station fine, but when the Belkin is touching the base station it transmits at 70% signal strength. My PowerBook can see the base station at 100% one floor up, 80% on the second floor up.Belkin software was easy to use and configure. Maybe my HP Pavilion causes a lot of RF interference? Unknown, but I'd try a Linksys or Hawking over the Blekin. Don't be swayed by the price."
1,Defective product,"I bought two adapters from a third party site on Amazon. One of them was defective. I tried calling Belkin and after talking to 4 people the problem wasn't solved.The last one asked me to download some software ferom belkin before they could replace it. I called them back when it didn't work, only to be told that, "" They didn't have the power to order a replacement and I would have to wait for someone to call me back.The WORST customer service I have ever come across. I will never buy a belkin product again."
1,This product is the worst networking device I have ever seen,"I have been working with networks since 1994 and have not seen a worse network card in my life. It was a pain in the rear to get working with windows 98 and had to actually install windows 98 SE. There was nothing on any website, or in the documentation that stated this. Finally tech support told us it didn't work. Then on a brand new pc with XP we can't get the thing running either.It usually takes me 15 minutes to install a network card.This company lied about their product and it should be recalled."
