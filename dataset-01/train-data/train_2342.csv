4,A sweet romance,"I have to admit I had a hard time buying into the 20th century woman and the 13th century ghost, but I enjoyed the story. There are a lot of ""stretches"" for the imagination (such as, if all she had to do was sign over the castle, she didn't need to visit it to do so, but then we wouldn't have had much of a story, now would we?). The main character, Genevieve's reluctance to accept her ""dream castle"" could have resulted in her disposing of it immediately. But once I got past that and past my initial ""how is she going to make this work?"" with the ghost, Kendrick, I sat down to enjoy it. Ms. Kurland's ""texturized"" descriptions were very good although once Kendrick became corporeal, things dragged a bit. The consummation of the marriage took a bit long, the game playing of making each other suffer was somewhat insufferable. HOWEVER, I did enjoy this book and would recommend it. Its light and fun and the interaction between the main characters is enjoyable."
2,Glad I did not read this one first!,"I actually listened it to, and did not like the reader at all - she did not do the accents very well, and when the character ""bellowed"" she croaked... anyway, if I had the hard copy I likely would not have finished it. Both characters got on my nerves, especially Gen. I have read most of the other McLeod and De Piaget novels, and found them to be most enjoyable. My favorites are ""A Garden in the Rain"" and ""With Every Breath"". All in all I do not think this is a good introduction to Lynn Kurland. Read other titles first - they are far more enjoyable, and chances are you will even reread them!"
5,Stardust of Yesterday,"Wonderful book, couldn't put it down. The author made it seem that any wish could come true. This author has great promise."
5,"Great humor, romance, intrique ! ! !","I read this so fast I was disappointed when it ended. Lynn Kurland filled this story with wonderful humor, heart-breaking romance and incredible hope. The mix of 13th century man and ideals with 20th century problems was written very well!"
5,Almost in Two Pieces....A Great Read (& Re-read & Re-Read),"This is one of my all time favorites. I have read it so many times that it is almost in 2 pieces. You will laugh out loud, cry and hopefully, fall in love with the characters!!Gen is a wonderful girl who runs into a bit of bad luck with her decorating business and has never had a love life. However, the inheritance of a castle may be the answer to her dreams!Kendrick is a knight in shining armor - even if it is a bit rusty. But what can you expect of a 13th century ghost who was deceived and murdered?The other characters (especially the ghosts) are some of the best out of all of the books I own (which is over 400 - all historical romances)!! However, don't discredit Ms. Kurland's other books & their characters, they are just as good as this one!"
4,A most charming ghost of a host,"This book combines elements of paranormal and time-travel romance, two categories I'm generally not fond of. Yet I really, really enjoyed Kendrick - a twelfth century ghost with a Jag in the garage (who cares if he can't drive it) and a passion for American football. The first two hundred pages of this book are a delight. Genevieve inherits Kendrick's castle and he goes from trying to scare her to death to falling in love with her. I consider myself a grounded, logical person but I had no problem suspending disbelief for this part of the story.Ironically, it's the next hundred pages when a human problem of Genevieve's becomes the obstacle that I wanted to throw the book across the room. Her ""problem"" was beyond believing for me.Still, this has some potential as a keeper simply because Kendrick is one of the most enchanting heroes I've encountered in the last year. He kind of makes you want to have a ghost of your own."
5,"A beautiful, beautiful read","Lynn Kurland is an amazing writer and her imagination never ceases to amaze me.Stardust was beautifully written and was one of the most touching romances I have ever read. It now has a coveted spot on my ""keepers"" bookshelf and will be read many more times in the future.Her characters are always intriguing and endearing. Kendrick has always had a special place in my heart from the moment he began appearing in Lynn's books. Most likely because his wit and off-balance humour reminds me of someone else I love dearly. His match is well met in the fiesty, adorable Genevieve.Good ghost-love stories are often hard to come by, but this one is wonderful."
2,Soooooooo Predictable!,"The premise of this book was so promising...but it's so predictable and formulaic, I found it almost annoying. The book alternates between the unbelievable - ghosts that hire lawyers, wear jeans and watch football - and the contrived. The romance is heavy-handed and drippy. Don't bother."
2,Avoid this stinker,"If you like strong men with a thing for airheads, you'll love this book. I hated it. The heroine is a childish nitwit who runs around in footy pajamas and pigtails, and is terrified by the thought of a gorgeous male making love to her. Imagine! Isn't that what women read romance novels for?? The final straw came when the author deprived her audience of the much-much-awaited love scene by (literally) slamming the door in our faces. Kurland CAN write and shows skill with humor. Too bad she picked a preschooler for a heroine."
3,Not Bad,"I'm a big fan of romance novels, especially ones with time travels, ghosts and the supernatural. I enjoyed the overall plot in this story, the humor and the ghost's personality I liked, but I was a bit disappointed by the herione's disposition of crying all the time. And the villian struck me as a little bit cliched. But, grant you, I'm more of a person who looks for a girl in the story who doesn't just sit on the sidelines screaming, but accually involved and can do stuff. But that's just me."
5,Fantasy of a lifetime!,"This was truly an incredible book, truly joyous and gives the reader a happy feeling. A definite read for anyone who dreams of a fantasies."
3,still waiting,"I ordered this set because I wanted something inexpensive, and in this color. I ordered it 7/15/12 and was supposed to get it by the estimated delivery date of 7/26 but it was several days later when it finally arrived. The set itself is fine, its what I expected for the price, but the coffee table top and shelf arrived badly damaged, so I emailed them to request new ones. They answered my request right away with a call and email and said they'd request new parts from the manufacturer, and once received then they'd inspect them in their warehouse and ship them to me. Its now 9/1/12 and I still haven't reveived them. They said the first replacement they got was also damaged so they had to request it again. I do appreciate them not sending me another damaged set, but it is frustrating that I'm still waiting for my replacements over a month later..."
2,Not very informative,"I thought finally a biography on Kris Kristofferson. It seems that by watching this dvd, you get more questions than answers. The beginning is okay, they talk about the early days but the documentary lacks early day viewing material. Would of been nice to see Kris perform in the late 60's early 70's. Then they talk about a few of his bigger movies like A star is born and Heaven's gate but no mention of his other great movies like Convoy, Welcome home and Songwriter. There's barely any mention of what he was up to during the late 70's and 80's.I just think that more effort could of been put into this project and treat the fans to something decent. We only get some of the story. Hopefully something better will come along someday."
2,A Wealth of Information But Inconsistent,"""Elvis Aaron Presley: Revelations from the Memphis Mafia"" is an interesting and ultimately necessary read for any serious Elvis fan. The revelations dished out by three of Elvis' closest confidants are mostly fresh and revealing; any book on Elvis is bound to rehash some of what's been said before.The problem with ""Elvis Aaron Presley"" is that the book is very inconsistent. On one page, a member of the Memphis Mafia says Elvis comes from Jewish ancestry, and on another page, a member of the Mafia talks about Elvis' anti-Semitic remarks. And on one page, a member of the Mafia talks about an event that would be the ""only time"" it ever happened to Elvis, and yet later in the book, that same member brings up several other instances of the same event.Ultimately, ""Elvis Aaron Presley"" is worthwhile to read for the perspective and bits of new information about Rock & Roll's greatest icon, but it must be read critically and in proper context."
5,"Best ""Elvis"" book ever written!","If you never read another ""Elvis"" book,read this one!It is a monumental work.I read it in two days,while on vacation.The paperback version is over 900 pages.It is so riveting,one simply can't put it down.The book isn't written in typical biographical style.It is based on interviews with three members of the ""Memphis Mafia."" The reader feels as if he were in the room with them,as they reminisce about their lives with the King.I have gone back to the book,many times.This is without a doubt,the definitive book,on Elvis Aaron Presley!If you don't have it,get it.I guarantee,you will not be disappointed.This reader has read more than his share of Elvis tomes,and this one is the penultimate!"
5,Wish it was longer,"I've read a lot of Elvis books, but I would say this is one of my faves. I don't know if all of it is true, but I just loved how detailed it was. I couldn't stop reading it, and I learned some things I didn't know before. Yes, some of it was unkind and gossipy, but I enjoyed it."
5,All you need to know about Elvis,"WOW! What I have been yearning for years to learn about the personal side of Elvis, I learned in this book. This is one of those rare books that you pick up and can not put down until you finish. Although it is over 900 pages, I read it in just four days because each page was a new adventure. After reading this book, you will discover that there is a very unique bond between the Memphis Mafia and Elvis. I think it was a friendship that we all want to have at one time throughout our life. The only downfall to this book is that it makes you want to have MORE of it! Hopefully they will write another book and tell more stories."
4,Money Talks,"Oh That Old saying : ""MONEY TALKS"" ! No wonder Elvis just wanted to be loved, and felt people loved him for his money and his name, and just for whatever anyone could get from him ! Isn't it funny how when Elvis was alive, not one of his so called ""friends"", would cut him up, They were afraid the $'s would stop. Sonnie and Red only wrote there book on all Elvis dirt for the $'s, because they were fired, and needed a buck ! And anyone who would have stopped getting everything from Elvis would do the same, for a dollar. Elvis always felt everyone was around him for his name and his money, not for who he really was as a person, and oh how right he was. I think it's so sad.........to love anyone for money, and not for there heart, and the person they are. With ""friends"" like this, Elvis sure did'nt need enemies. I sure don't know how these people sleep at night------Oh ya.........I know............IT's FOR THE MONEY !!!!!!!! Dina"
5,This is THE book on Elvis,"""Elvis Aaron Presley: Revelations from the Memphis Mafia"" is one of the best books that I have ever read. The book is based on in-depth interviews with three of Elvis' closest friends; Billy Smith, Marty Lacker, and Lamar Fike. Together, this three tells the most complete story about The Artist of the Century ever written. What's makes this book so unique is that the three individuals actually was there when it all happened. Not always all three at the same time, but at least one was present at (almost) all time. It's a honest book. It's three men, talking directly to the reader, about their friend. That's what makes this book so much more than an ordinary biography. And it's all put together in a brilliant way by the author, Alanna Nash. This is THE book on Elvis."
1,Trash these people are out of their minds,This is the most trashy unsophisticated brabble I have ever read in any genre. If you are an Elvis fan. Save your hard earned dollars and read Elvis Straight Up by Joe Esposito. I think Billy Marty and Lamar got hoodwinked by this slickster Nash. She would be better writing fairy tales along with that nut that wrote Elvis What Happened.Marty Lacker and Lamar Fike have really turned into some of the most despicable characters Elvis was ever associated with. Shame on you guys!!!
5,Revelations from the Memphis Mafia,"I've finished the book and can't help but want to know more.I cried in the last few chapters - especially for Billy Smith. I'm devastated about what I now know about Elvis - reading this book validated some of the things I'd heard and provided the details that made me feel like I was actually there.I'm glad I have read it and I think its a must read for anyone who feels a connection to Elvis Presley. If you're like me and you want to know who this man really was and why the world still loves him, buy this book.I will be forever changed by this book, hearing his music will never be the same again, I can't describe the emotional reaction I have had to this book. Thank you Alanna for being brave enough to put this together for all of us."
5,THIS is IT!,"I discovered Elvis when I was 12 years. It's hard to get an accurate account of his life...when I read this book, I couldn't put it down until I was finished. It's truly an amazing book!"
4,Very good!!!,This book was in very good condition. There was visible wear but it wasn't bad enough to work with. I use this book a lot for class so I'm glad it wasn't in bad shape.
5,a great help,"This class, Biomechanics, was the hardest class I took in college, yet somehow ended-up being my favorite. The professor was really cool,and always helpful, which I really appreciated. I sold this wonderful textbook at the end of the class, but I wish I hadn't. I highly recommend this book by Peter McGinnis. In fact, I'd like to meet him sometime!"
3,Easy read,This textbook is basically simplified physics applied for the body...It's written clear and is not too difficult in level
3,Solid album,"This is the first album by the band and shows a bit. The songs are well put together and enjoyable. Given the choice of listening to an album end to end, I prefer to their newest Under Under Hill. There are some true musical gems on the album which are evenly disbursed through the album which makes the album as a whole enjoyable. Track 1 should be an ""album only"" track unavailable for purchase. From a production stand point it would have been nice to see this track at the end of the album rather than a spot of prominence on an album designed to be their introduction to the world. As usual the composition and harmonies are what draw you into the music."
4,simply some damn good didj !!,"Alan Dargin really knows how to play this magical aboriginal instrument. The music on this album completely invalidates the sometimes-heard misconception of the didgeridu as a droning, boring instrument. It's got energy and style."
5,Fair book,"I really respect the way Schmidt wrote this book. It was fair and thought provoking. Anyone reading the book can see that he strives for accuracy and honesty. He is extremely fair and professional, not resorting to shoddy 'science' or personal attacks. This book was thought provoking and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is, knows, or cares about homosexuals. (aka everyone)"
4,Enjoyable and challenging,My son who is 5 years old likes the I-Spy games. This one was no exception...It was a challenge for him and kept him interested without causing too much frustration. If your child likes I-Spy I would add this to your collection.Depending on the age of your child you may need to sit and play with him/her on some of the levels.
5,Very Good Game,I liked this game alot but I would recommend I Spy Treasure Hunt if you want to try one of the I Spy games go with Treasure Hunt first. It is very enjoyable for all ages.
2,Ouch,"If it wasn't for Kari Wuhrer's attractive naked body that appears throughout the movie this movie wouldn't ""work"" like it did.Kari plays Lauren, who is an analyst at an investment banking company. Baldwin plays Clay and he is the son of a very rich owner of a client firm. Together they make a plan to get all the rich man's money without killing him.Good only if you like Kari Wuhrer...you'll get to see a lot of her...if you know what I mean."
2,Not so much silk in this web.,"This is truly a ""B"" quality movie and like many ""B"" movies they are Rent-ers NOT Buyers. There was oddly some good acting by Stephen Baldwin, but that is only to Stephen Baldwin standards. For the Kari Wuhrer fans there are a couple of goods scenes where she is ""Performing at Her Best"". OK movie to see but, stick to the video store with this bad boy"
3,Almost porn,"This movie wasn't bad, but was almost a porno! It was like watching ""soft-core"" with a plot. Not a bad movie though."
4,"A Sexy Movie, Erotic Thriller","I think this movie falls in the genre of erotic thriller. Basicly that means it's a movie with nude scenes. And so fans of Kari Wuhrer gets to see her do sex scenes in the movie. I think the movie does pretty good keeping you tuned in, in between the nudity, as there is drama and good story. But it is essentially a movie for Kari Wuhrer fans since she is lead actress, lead character, and we get to see her nude."
1,toxic waste,"Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects, Sex Monster) plays a big shot son of another big shot who gets involved with the beautiful Kari Wuhrer (Anaconda, Eight Legged Freaks) in a game of deciet and passion. Why couldnt it of been passion and canoles? The 2 are after a crapload of money, and both become entangled with one another, but can they trust each other. Boring, with way too much bad acting. Only interest for guys who like Wuhrer and want to see her in the buff and for those fans who already know Baldwin's career is in the john, but want to watch another movie he is in ruin it. Baldwin and Wuhrer Executive Produced this debacally mundane fart joke"
4,Diamond Grip is a keeper,These gloves are the best I have ordered and would rate them excellent even with the cost being much higher than similar products. I rather pay more to get a quality product and Diamond Grip gloves are a good quality. The length of the glove comes above your wrist which is nice and the thickness and quality of the latex is very good.
4,Another nice ASV/Living Era collection,"Gordon MacRae was not the most famous male vocalist of his era, but he had a good voice and it is nice to see this collection. His greatest fame came in collaboration with Jo Stafford, and fortunately this CD has a dozen MacRae/Stafford duets.All the songs were recorded in the period from 1947 to 1950. As is typical of the era, many were also recorded by other artists, and are better known in those other versions, like Doris Day's ""It's Magic"" and Perry Como's ""A - You're Adorable."" However, a few songs in the collection, like the MacRae/Stafford record of ""Whispering Hope,"" were big hits in their own right.The period included a 1948 musicians' strike, and so some tracks, like ""Bluebird of Happiness"" are done without instrumental backing. This makes for an unusual sound, but one I like.All told, this is a pleasant sounding collection."
2,Great for BB guns,"...but if you're going to use a larger caliber, steer clear of this choice. I purchased this hanger for my son's use when he accompanies me to the range. Due to its design this product lasted two outings at the range before it was destroyed with a .22 caliber. It is also cumbersome to tear down for storage but luckily I only had to do that once!"
2,"only for bb, pellet, or airsoft guns",It's a fine product for the proper use. I hit it with a 7.62x39 on the first day and ruined it.
1,fell apart,Sadly one day with a squirrel in this feeder was in pieces. the birds did not like it either. i have 10 feeders and they avoided this one totaly.
4,Wonderful Bird Feeder,"Beautiful wood bird feeder.Aside from the shingles looking a little loose, quality is enviousMy Grandmother loved this bird feeder.I've made bird feeders before, and after seeing this I had to get it for my Grandmother.I hope to make some like this for myself. But for the price I paid, might be cheaper to buy another than build one."
1,tall bird feeder,When I received this bird feeder in the mail it was broken. I had to wait for my husband to get scrap wood to repair it. it seemed like I spent more money then I saved by the time it was able to be used as a bird feeder.
3,Nice watch for the price,I brought this watch for my niece. She loves this watch. It's cool and casual. She seems to wear this watch always.
2,Awkward,"This watch has two different bands - I prefer the one not shown which is light blue and three inter-changable characters (Pooh, Tigger & Eeyore). I bought it for my 3 year old daughter. The main part of the watch is too big and bulky and not easy to open & close. It also didn't come with a pouch or box to keep the extra band and characters. My daughter didn't like it much because it was uncomfortable - would not recommend."
4,Early Tangerine Dream,I like the older Albums that Tangerine Dream has made. The album Alpha Centauri is more of a experimental ambient-space album. The group took a chance and came up with a landmark album. When I heard this album I was very pleased with the atmosphere is manifested in my mind. I'm an artist and purchase albums based on how inspirational they are. Alpha Centauri is a extreamly inpirational album and was a must buy for me.
4,Fascinating journey to the bygone days..,This is an excellent book that takes one back to the fascinating dusk of the glorious days of Indian Royals. Lucy Moore writes in her fluid style the story of four Maharani's all the way back from mid 1800s till now. The book gives an unique peek into the dual lives of Maharanis in their zenanas and the high society of Europe. Must read for subcontinental history buffs.
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for some spicy mayonnaise to give tuna fish some kick. This wasabi mayonnaise seemed like a good idea - but it doesn't taste that great. You are better off just adding horseradish to your food - which is all this is...and not very strong at that. It sits in my fridge, 80% uneaten and will probably make its way to the trash soon."
4,"Great book, horrible editing","This is a delightful visionary book that explores American politics in a unique, mystical way. Providing an enlightened roadmap to how we could all change the course of our planet's future, the book takes us on a journey of possibilities. My only complaint is the terrible editing. There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the book which really detracts from the readability and credibility of this book. A good proofreader should have caught these errors. Still, an enjoyable read!"
4,great live band,If you like the 80's type metal with great guitar riffs and monster bass and drums check out this band from indiana. i caught them live in gulf shores alabama and they deliver the product well as anyone i have seen today.
5,If you are looking for extra pratice problems here they are.,"This book is about extra practice. It does not explain how to do dosage problems. You will find more than enough dosage practice problems in this book. I wish however there had been more Heparin dosage problems that covered ""the dosage schedule of a patient on Heparin over the course of a day"". That was the one test that flunked the most students in my class. Otherwise I would recommend pre-nursing students to buy this book the summer before classes begin and do every problem in the book. You will have fewer problems with math tests given each semester of nursing school."
5,MAGYAR REGEK,The REGE is another brilliant CD from this hungarian band from Csallokoz region (north from river Danube). The music is a beautiful mixture of magyar nepzene (hungarian folk music) and modern sounds. Add all those musical instruments the band uses and you will not leave the CD on the shelf for long.Highly recommended to anybody who loves interestingly perfect music (especially listen to nb 2 and 10 tracks).
1,How much?,"At $25 for 66 pages, all the information in this book can be found easily on DIY websites - what a rip!"
2,Doesn't work on UK systems,"I know this is a good film because I saw it when it first released, but unfortunately this disc will not play on my UK DVD player."
4,Cool movie but paints a very poor image of BDSM,"I enjoyed this movie but was rather irritated with the way it painted all kinky folk as emotionally damaged and sexually abused. That's a very negative stereotype and I hate seeing it perpetuated. Other than that, I liked it. The plot twists and turns nicely and there are some very hot scenes in it. There's some interesting eye candy in the cinematography that I enjoyed also (primarily in the dream scenes). If you're thinking of buying this movie because you're interested in BDSM a better choice might be Secretary, but if you're looking for a fun thriller with a twist this is your ticket. :)"
2,Just say no,"A detective (Ellen Barkin) is hunting a sadistic serial killer and discovers that the victims belonged to an underground sex club. She enlists the help of a shady lady who helps her navigate this unknown world.I want two hours of my life back. I struggled to stay awake during this convoluted story which is marred by bad acting, bad dialogue, and is essentially a pretty bad and predictable movie. Unless you're a Peta Wilson fan (there is plenty of her on display), this is definitely a must miss.TJ Vest, August 2008"
3,Not Quite Ellen Barkin,"I thought this video had a lot of potential for being a strong quiet erotic mistery, but everyone, especially Ellen played it way over the top. Trying so hard to be sensuous, when she should have just let her normal wonderful sensuality come through on it's own. It started off very nice. Wonderful music (where can I get that sound track), but then starts to get somewhat thin. The actual plot is interesting. I just don't think the actors pulled it off very well. It may have been the direction. I'm still very much an Ellen Barkin fan."
5,Houston at it's Best,"Love this movie, keeps you guessing! And even though shot in Canada, looks just like places in Houston that it depicts!"
1,For Peta Wilson fans only...,"A terrible film... if it weren't for Peta Wilson, it'd have no redeeming value whatsoever."
3,One good scene,There is one good scene in this movie that makes it worth it. A scene that involves Ellen Barkin and a beautiful Petra Wilson(?). The seduction is breath taking.
3,Mercy Mercy Mercy,"Did anyone else notice that in the opening scene when Ellen Barkin climbs onto the bed to view the first victim. She does not look dead then on top of that the girl who has been murdered blinks. I am surprised that the crew did not spot it. I did upon watching this video.Playing dead is fine but don't have her blink. That just spoiled the movie from there on in.I also did not like that Julian Sands dressed up as a woman. I mean there is this sex symbol dressed in woman's clothing.....Yuck sorry.... Julian you make one ugly woman.But we still think you are sexy.Keep up the great work and the great acting.I love all your other work, but this movie was bad bad bad....."
1,Disappointing,"I must say I am very disturbed that Peta Wilson has been put in a string of clunkers, even sinking to doing a stupid lesbian flick. Really proves the point that hollyweird has gone all out - not for me, I will watch re-runs of Nikita and try not to think of queers."
3,This is the review for you,"Yes, this movie has lesbianism, bondage, nudity, fetishism, Ellen Barkin. No, it is NOT for sex-hungry little perverts! After reading some of the other reviews, I have to say it's obvious that some people didn't understand the movie. It's not for everyone, really, because it explores very difficult subjects and can make you quite uncomfortable. Contrary to what you may think when reading some of the other reviews, ""Mercy"" is not about sex between women. It is merely where the scene is set. So if you are keen to watch ladies getting it on, this is not the movie for you, go buy a Penthouse or something.Mercy will appeal to people who are not easily shocked, who are able to read between the lines, and who can follow up on an unfinished train of thought themselves. The movie is very flawed, I'll admit. Maybe the director wasn't focused enough. BUT: If you want to REALLY blow your mind, read the book. It's incredibly brilliant, and the movie isn't a patch on it."
4,Great lightweight stroller with good canopy,"This is a great, basic stroller. We used it to replace our Chicco stroller when the wheel broke off after only one year! This stroller is lightweight and has a much better canopy than the other umbrella strollers I've seen, so my son has much better sun protection. We use it every day and it's great. If you're tall, the handles might be too low for you, and the wheels are smaller so it's not as easy to manuever as some other strollers I have, but the straps are easy to use and my son loves it and begs to go in it!"
3,Typical Japanese softcore...with several stimulating moments,"I lived in Japan for a few year and was exposed...even delighted in those days at the way Japanese sexploitation movies work. First one must accept that no pubic hair (which was still in fashion when many of these movies were made) is to be seen nor are male...how shall we say? members. But everything else, from the technical quality of the films to the attraciveness of the actresses (the actors are mostly props to keep the action moving) to the types of sex portrayed.(e.g usually a violent rape per movie) are arousing....at leat to me. In the scheme of things the Toyko train series is typical but not exceptional. For me one should see classics like ""Debauchery"" or even ""Female TEacher....(Dirty Afteroon) to see what I'd consider to be 4 or even 5 star examples of this genre.\"
2,"ordinary, not very erotic",i bought this thinking it was genuine japanese erotica but its relatively ordinary r rated sexy movie. a watered down version of the xxx rated version. not recommend.
4,"So far, so very good","Ordered 3 of these with a little bit of skepticism, but found they are very heavy, very well-made counter-height bar stools that are both classic and modern. They have a small footprint, too, which made them perfect for the bar table behind my sofa in my media room. Assembly was time consuming (about 25-30 minutes each), but not difficult. Make sure you follow directions closely, especially to attach the back to the top seat before attaching the legs/swivel assembly and to NOT tighten the screws too tight (or you run the risk of cracking the wood). Watched an entire movie the other night sitting in one, and while it wasn't as relaxing as sitting on the sofa, it was fairly comfy."
3,Still not sure,"The chairs do look attractive. Appear well-made and durable. The seating surface areas is not large.My biggest concern is that when one sits on the chair (does not have to be a super heavy person), the chair ""creaks"" a lot with the slightest movement. And the noise does not seem to go away."
1,not happy with customer service and follow up and chair was broken,"I received a broken chair initially, so i called customer service, at that point ihad to get them all sorts of info to proceed with getting a replacement part sent to me, i had to call multiple times and finally they sent me my part, the part was wrong after about 10 days, i had to call them again and they resent me another chair. the directions are terrible and can be much clearer"
4,Exposed nails,Great chairs but two of them had tacks sticking up on the edges of the cushions that snagged our pants. Fortunately we did not have shorts on.
3,Nice chairs - not the height it says!,"The web text indicates these bar height chairs at 24"" high, so i ordered them knowing our table was 30"" high. Turns out they are 29.5"" high. We put one together and they are very nice but not the right height.I'm also very frustrated to find out I have to wait 48 hours to find out if I'm allowed to return these to the seller! If the seller can't write an accurate Amazon description, I shouldn't have to keep them. I'm waiting and will have major issues if I'm not allowed to return them.For those looking for quality chairs at the higher height, they are very nice."
2,Flimsy construction,"We literally used the chair once and the three of the four bolts/anchors holding the seat cushion to the swivel pulled out of the wood stool base. The anchors have teeth, so there is no obvious way to fix the problem. We are an an average size family (no one over 200 lbs) - no problenms with weight overload. Just poor or cheap parts and construction."
5,Excellent value,After you complete the required assembly - the stool is worth every penny. Excellent quality. The stool looks great and is very comfortable to sit on. Recommend to anyone.
5,Better than expected at this price!,"We ordered four of these, took a chance based on mostly positive reviews...very impressed! The quality and the ease with which they assembled was a nice surprise. After assembly they are sturdy, well built stools. Sort of followed the instructions, but, honestly, after fumbling around a bit it was pretty obvious how they went together. Strongly recommended!"
1,This is not a real book,"This ""book"" is obviously self-published, and consists of disconnected series of words that don't really make sense, or even sentences, much less paragraphs or chapters. It's the only book I've purchased from Amazon that I actually returned. It seems like nothing so much as the stream-of-consciousness thoughts of someone sitting in front of a TV watching the endless talking heads covering the Peterson case. I've never seen anything remotely like it. It's truly a waste of time, paper, and money. If you don't believe me and buy it anyway, don't say you weren't warned!"
1,What a waste of money,Dont buy this book-it is not a book as we know it-rather the notes of someone in need of serious help-if i had read the flap notes of the book first i wouldnt have bought it.Note to the author-if any one other than me is foolish enough to buy this garbage and you make a few dollars please use it wisely and get yourself some professional help
1,32 Bucks? You got to be kidding me right?,This book costs twice the price of the well known authors. Whats the deal here? This just looks strange. I'll pass.
1,Another ghoul,"Good God! Another ghoul like Loretta Dillon and Brad Knight, just seeking to make money from the blood and bones of a dead woman and child. Another self-published, vanity book like Dillon's, self-published because they had a keyboard,an opinion and a lack of shame and decency. You people are sick and shameless. It is a true sin that when people check Amazon for Sharon Rocha's book, excrement like these self-published books will pop into their faces."
1,Spare yourself from this one,"I had to read this book for a college course. Too bad for me, since it's the worst book I've had to read from cover to cover. HoRrIbLy boring, mostly incoherent, the book takes very promising themes and turns them into very stylish [material]. Loaded with clichés and overused images. Blah, blah, blah, it goes on and on. If I wasn't being evaluated on it for class I would have stopped reading it after the first 15 pages. It's the only Wideman book I've read, and of course I don't plan to read any others, but if this is proof of his best work, I hope he is a better creative writing professor than his writing would suggest."
1,tea tree oil toxic to pets,"The point is that cat (or dog) can lick an externally applied shampoo. A product applied in the ear can be absorbed into the bloodstream or spilt on the cat. I feel it is an outrageous scandal that these products are available online.This what the American Cancer Society says about Tea Tree Oil -- ""It should be kept away from pets and children"". Why Amazon still allow it to be advertised and sold on their site I do not know.[...]"
2,Didn't work out for me:(,It really didn't work out for me and my cats. I used to clean their ears after their baths. and they got a yeast infection. shouldn't have happend since their was tea tree oil in it.waste of money
3,"An ok goosebumps book, nothing special","This book was ok, but it had a retarted ending i wont give it away but remember (pinches) i know goosebumps is for younger people but some of the points rl stine put in this book just makes it to unbeleivable and retarted"
5,Happy customer,Bought a used copy and the description of the item's condition was accurate. Would have thought it was brand new. I was required to buy this as a textbook for school and it has proven to be an extremely useful guide.
4,"Fasten Your Seat-belts, We're Off To Suburbia!","The Sound Barrier was one of Tot Taylor's numerous projects back in 1985, while running the Compact Organization label. ""The Suburbia Suite"" was the only album released under that name, and what a charming little album it was. Call it pop jazz-swing or whatever you like, it still sounds awfully catchy and impressive 15 years on. With evocative titles like ""Mornington Crescent NW1"" ""Bank Holiday"" and ""Half-Term Excursion"" it brings back memories of my days in England.. and what a marvellous remastering job they have achieved!now, if only Mr.Taylor and company would get to work on the much overdue re-release of Ms Lindt's ""Play/Record""..."
4,Sharp looking watch,"I have gotten many compliments on this watch. It's very stylish and might even look more expensive than it really is. The only complaint I have is that the date window is way too small. Otherwise, I'm happy with this purchase."
4,A Daily Double For The Biscuit,"This is a very inexpensive way to spruce up an office or den with two quality prints of Seabiscuit.Partcularly impressive is The Biscuit in his barn. Placed in attractive frames, the pair will easily be a daily double with guests, business associates and family members."
3,Paul Revere??,"This book has value from the standpoint that it might inspire readers to research other poems and poets. I was appalled, however, at the historical mistake Miss Kennedy made in the forward to the 'America' section. She was speaking about her grandmother, Rose Kennedy, growing up in Concord, Massachusetts and perhaps that she had even 'caught a glimpse' of Paul Revere. She needs to know that Paul Revere lived during the American Revolution, a full century before Rose Kennedy was even born."
1,puh-lease,"I cannot deny the sentimental attractiveness of this book, but it does not work as an anthology of poetry. The emphasis is on the celebrity, not the poetry. These poems may or may not be worth while, but the fact that Caroline Kennedy uses them as a tribute to her mother (however lovely that sentiment) completely diminishes the poetry as poetry. That Jackie cherished these poems misses the point entirely, for then the only reason to read these poems is to come into contact with Jackie's ghost, not the poetry itself. If you genuinely love poetry, you understand that it is the poetry itself that can save and sustain us--not whether Michael Jackson's editor found comfort or solace or delight in them.This is a great book for those who don't read poetry--or those who buy books of poetry by Jewel."
4,This was a sentimental purchase,"I bought this book with the intention of giving it as a gift and wound up keeping it for myself. It is, first and foremost, a loving tribute to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis from her daughter. But it also happens to be a terrific collection of poetry!"
1,Be Careful Before You Buy This!,"Last year I spent over $55.00 for a pristine, still shrink wrapped copy of Senso on dvd. What I DIDN'T originally know was that the dvd was multiregional, coming from Brazil, in the original Italian language with subtitles ONLY in Portugese! Unless you are fluent in either Italian or Portugese, you will be spending a high price on a dvd you will never watch. If the Amazon.com Seller had notified me before my purchase that the dvd had no English subtitles before they so willingly took my money, of course I would have saved my cash. Adding insult to injury, I found MANY copies of the very same dvd on eBay, and they were ALL much cheaper! Take it from a guy who has learned a hard lesson: Before your bank account is charged for this dvd, inquire about it. You will be glad you did."
3,Be Sensoble,Are you kidding - $1000?!?!It doesnt matter how old rare good and any other criteria no DVD is worth thisPut this guy out of his misery. Please.you are better off sending a letter to Criterion!
2,A CUT EDITION,THIS IS A VERY RARE EDITION ON DVD BUT WITH THREE MINUTES CUT. ONLY THE ITALIAN AND FRENCH EDITIONS OF SENSO ARE UNCUT. THE UNCUT EDITIONS OD THIS MOVIE MUST HAVE A 123 MINUTES LENGHT WITH NTSC SYSTEM AND 118 MINUTES WITH PAL.
5,Another Favorite,"Narrowly excaping the hangman's noose, Jolie marries Daniel to save her own life. She figures she can always excape when the coast is clear, but the one thing Jolie did not count on is falling in love with this highly respected Widower Rancher. Miller's Daniel's Bride is another Romantic classic with adventure, intrigue, and mystery. Her characters are real, and easily understood, and her plot is extraordinary."
4,THE VERY BEST OF THIS GENRE!!!!,"This is a wonderful, sexy and charming book. The characters are well written and the story is unique. If you like this sort of book, this is a must read."
3,"Jolie is Great, but Daniel is undeserving of her","I liked Jolie's character, and the story for the most part. The story would have been much better if Daniel wasn't such a tortured man. He was really such a jerk most of the time, even though his character was quite sexy. I just wanted to shake him!"
1,Disappointing,"What a waste of a good storyline. The characters had no personality and were plain annoying. For a strong woman jolie was a doormat and apart from being an exceptionally good lover, Daniel was overbearingly the wrong kind of macho. The one star i gave this was for the sex, not the characters or the storyline."
2,Didn't really care for it...,This is my 9th book by this author & for me the books are almost always just all right. The characters in this book just had no personality in my opinion & I felt like I'd read the book before. Nothing special in my opinion. The storyline just wasn't that interesting to me & usually when there are children in a book they are usually really cute & funny but the children in this book did nothing for me. I'm sorry but I can't recommend this book.
3,"Interesting work, but only for a die-hard fan","Masamune Shirow is one of the most interesting and accessible manga creators with his works Appleseed and Ghost in the Shell. This is his second color art book and - while good - is not what you may expect. This book focuses on his fantasy work, not science fiction, so don't expect to see any familiar faces from his manga. I found his experiments using computer art interesting, and artists may enjoy his detailed descriptions on composition. I would recommend getting Intron Depot 1 first and waiting for 3 which is again to be science fiction pieces."
5,"Wow! Don't read about the movie, just go watch it...","Often in my reviews, I touch on elements of the plot. I wouldn't call them ""spoilers"" per se, but I went in to this movie almost cold, and that turned out to be an immensely rewarding experience! Harakiri rewards patience. I was actually bored for the first 30 minutes of the film, and then it all comes together. Somewhat light on action, this film is an articulate criticism of the corruption power brings and the length one man goes to expose the hypocrisy."
5,Behind the make believed glorification of Harakiri.,"I have seen all Japanese masterpieces, but this one is absolutely the very best Japanese samurai movie ever made. Director Kobayashi used his piercing observing eyes to tell the world that there are painful agony and undisclosed black truth of the overly golorified Harakiri (suicide by self-inflicted abdomen cutting and openning). I first watched this movie in 1973 and immediately was convinced this one is the best Japanese movie ever made. Only Akira Kurosawa's movies like Rashomon, etc. can match with Harakiri's depth and enlightenment. A must see movie, it makes you think, and realized that many of the glorified- virtures the society adores and admires are actually nothing but sad lies."
5,Excellent Movie,One of the best films I've seen. Very sad and heroic. A powerful show. I would recommend it to anybody who can read subtitles.
5,Amazing storytelling...,"Of the many samurai films I have seen, this one sticks out as one of the best storytelling films ever. Totally engrossing and memorable, highly recommended for any samurai movie fan, or any movie fan in general."
3,Bad cropping,"The film itself is a masterpiece - the build-up of tension as the main character tells his story, climaxing in his final lesson - you will not find anything like it in cinema. And as always with Criterion, the image quality and extras are unparalleled.But there is one major problem that existed in their DVD release and still exists in the Blu-ray edition: the sides have been cropped by about 10% total. See DVDBeaver for several side-by-side comparisons (particularly, the scene in which Chijiiwa is seated in a white robe, surrounded by clan members - one guy on the left is cropped out, destroying the composition of the scene). I have also added two comparison images to the Amazon Product photo gallery at the top of this page.It appears that only the Masters of Cinema Blu-ray edition has the right composition, but unfortunately the detail appears to be slightly lacking compared to Criterion.Hopefully Criterion will realize this problem and correct it in future releases."
5,Japanese blockbuster,"This is a film to cherish. I've seldom seen the wide screen used better, with every scene treated almost as a painting. The story unfolds over a couple of hours with everything absolutely essential to the tale. The actors are remarkable and the musical score using Japanese instruments (percussion particularly)is spare and effective. There are twists and turns wherever you look but everything seems completely natural and the camera work and editing are sublime but extremely effective. This is a Japanese masterpiece you won't forget!Curtis Stotlar"
1,Wrong Version,"The version of the film y'all have streaming for this title is the 1920's Fritz Lang film, not the Japanese one."
2,Is it the 1919 film or the 1962 film,"I give this 2 stars for a reason, I thought I would be watching the 1962 film... but when I began streaming it turned out it was the 1919 film. Nothing wrong with the silent film by Fritz Lang, which is what is depicted on the cover, but the information states that this is the 1962 film directed by Masaki Kobayashi, which is the film that I wanted to see. :-/"
2,Dull,"The music uses to much of the ocean surf as 'filler'. Should actually be called ""sounds of the surf"". Some synthesier thrown in their just a couple of cords. Enough to put you to sleep. Would have liked a bit more complexity and varing levels of energy coming from the music. Just all one speed: sedate."
1,"Tastes like dirt, and does nothing.",I bought this because of all the hype surrounding hoodia. I tried it for a week and never once did it diminish or suppress my appetite.
2,Ehh...,"Bitter tasting, I wish it could be better tasting. Can't say that it curbed my appetite because I could barely tolerate the taste."
3,"Halaku, Grandson of Genghes Khan","This is 1956 Hindi film, starring Pran, Meenakumari, and Ajit Kumar that did not become very popular. The artists have all done a very good job. It is the story of Halaku, the grandson of Genghes Khan and some of his misadventures. The film is historically significant."
1,Amos and Andy 6 DVD set,This is pure garbage - quality and content. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
4,Good source book,"I thought this book was quite good. I was pleased with the songs, and recommend it for all those who want to sing those old songs. Take it camping with you and your grand kids."
2,Good songs,Good songs but hard to see and keep the book open while playing. Especiall at the campfire.
3,campfire songs 3,I like the songs that it came with. The only thing that I didn't like about it is it's too small. It's not a large book hard to play and hold the book. But worked around that any ways because you have to put some of the chords to music not all written out.
5,Great little take-along book!,"This books contains so many familiar songs, written in a format that makes it perfect for singing around a campfire as the title suggests!"
2,"Oh great, now I can be the campfire buffoon!","Most of these songs shouldn't be sung at all, let alone by a campfire! There's only a couple worth singing, the rest of the book you can use for kindling! Sorry, but true."
2,Doesn't work on DVD player,I live in the US. This DVD is listed playable in all regions (not just Region 1 which is US and Canada). It plays fine on my computer but my DVD player absolutely does not recognize this DVD. I simply get a message on my TV screen indicating it will not play. My DVD player is only two years old so it should handle this film. The film itself is good and worth watching -- if you have a computer that plays DVD's.
4,The greatest QB in Pro Football History...(pls. read on...),"Sorry Phil Simms, Joe Montana, et, al;Big John, now owner of the ChampionColorado Crush in the Ar.FL, is thehands down best ever. Most careerstarts, most career wins. Most play-off wins, most fourth quarter and come-back wins, et, al. Only QB to take histeam to five Super Bowls - in 11 years!!"
2,The Beginning of an Education in Spanish,"The novel Una Mano En LA Arena Rafael and his girlfriend Virginia want to take a break from work one day, because of the nice weather they are having in Spain. At the Beach Virginia stumbles over a human hand sticking out of the sand. The following chapters are fraught with exciting, adventurous events that leave you with amazement. Rafael and Virginia deal with robbers, drugs, drug dealers, the police, and murder. If you are undergoing the studies of spanish, take a look at this book."
1,Never Got It,"I never received this item I contacted the seller and was told it would be sent out, but I still have not received it. I believe it has been a month if not longer."
4,"Exit Stage Left, best Rush live album ever","There's nothing to say about this if you've ever heard the album and if you haven't why are you reading this? This is simply the best example of Rush during these years which many consider their best.The videos, although some times grainy because of the time period, is just fabulous. The sound quality is top notch and you get to see what it was like to be there for this momentous album.If you like Rush, buy this video. You won't regret it."
3,Great concert but horrid sound,"This is footage from a good concert - the video is not to bad for the era. The audio tracks were remixed for this release but are badly affected by the the loudness war disease that so much modern music suffers from. Gone is the snap and crack of Neil Pearts drums - instead it's a nonstop blast of all loud all the time - audience noise is loud, guitars are loud. Trouble is if everything else is as loud as can be the drums can no longer be louder like they're supposed to be. Audiophiles will be VERY disappointed. Unfortunately most of Rush's other live DVDs have the same problem. Maybe we should just get rid of drummers in rock - we cannot hear them much anyway after the blastering engineers are done doing their damage."
2,not what i had expected.,"while Rush are still legends and the music on this DVD is not bad, all of the high caliber songs that are responsible for their fame (yyz, tom sayer) are commentated over during the length of the song, and broken up into bits and pieces while the guitarist explains this and that about touring and playing music with the band rush, I bought this DVD for a 15 hour drive from California and it was almost too boring to watch the whole thing. I would say maybe if you had a different motive than entertainment in making this choice.... that it might be held to a different opinion."
4,Rush,I have not always been a Rush fan. However I have really liked some of whats been released over the last few years.It's always nice to go back to yesteryear and see what made this power trio a great and well respected band.Exit Stage Left on dvd is a nice well done concert movie that is worth your hard earned bucks.It's funny I love their Live Rio dvd but the Cd was so bass heavey that it made my ears ring for days.The same thing applys here. The Cd - Album was remixed and the sound from it was not so good. The Dvd release redeams the album remaster by far.Lets hope that more comes from a truly great power trio.Cheers Richard Glenn
4,My favorite hard rock concert,Can someone please explain to me why Neil's drum solo is not on this DVD. The drum solo is on the VHS tape that I purchased in 1981. Also the clarity of the audio is not as precise on this DVD. Geddy's Rickenbacker bass (which he stopped using after the signals tour) should sound distinctly perfect and it doesn't on this DVD. Some RUSH fans would agree that EXIT STAGE LEFT is their best concert. The song selections are excellent. Does anyone out there know what I'm talking about? If anyone has a copy of this concert on DVD with the YYZ drum solo please contact me.
5,Rush Exit Stage Left,A truly awesome video of Rush in their prime. A must see for any musician inspired by progressive rock.
1,Just read help,I didn't find any really new useful information in the book that I couldn't figure out myself or find in help. I thought it was a waste of my money and time.
2,If you want immersion--go to Italy,"This tape program takes an ""immersion"" approach to Italian language instruction--accompanying cheesy sound effects give ""clues"" as to what is meant, but precise meaning is unclear and grammar concepts remain cloudy. The vocabulary is presented in no particular order--ie with no concern for utility and it's not good if you want something to listen to in the car (you really should follow the book for this one). The ""Drive In"" series is superior to Berlitz for car listening, and is better for vocab as well (in addition to being more engaging)."
3,"Learning as a child might. Entertaining, but difficult.","After working initially with the book, I listened to the tapes for many hours while commuting. Somethings have ""stuck"", but most have not. I feel that this would be an excellent program to take up with a partner or in a class, and would love to hear from someone who would like to practice with a beginner via email. I found ""Italian by Association"" by Michael Grunberg to be far more effective for vocabulary building."
2,Frustrating and disappointing,"I've been trying to use the tapes in the car, and now I'm giving up and getting my language instruction from another publisher. This is too confusing; it's like trying to be a detective while you learn to speak Italian. They use no English, and expect you to understand the words from context. I understood about 60 percent of it, and the rest I repeated like a parrot, while following it up, under my breath, with a frustrated, ""Whatever that means!"" I've picked out bits and pieces from the dictionary, etc., but why should I have to hunt them down?"
3,"Great for business traveler, less so for tourist","This is a fun and interesting immersion course but be warned that it seems geared primarily for business travelers, as many of the ""scenes"" take place in an office environment. It's also a little outdated in that secretary Sandra uses a typewriter and her friend Mario is amazed that she can use a computer, which makes a lot of beeping noises like a cartoon Univac. It would be nice to not only learn how to think in Italian but to also find out how to negotiate for tickets and converse with people on the street for directions, restaurant recommendations, etc. I'm learning language structure but not much useful vocabulary."
2,It's enough to make you want to give up on the language,"Though the book might be factually correct, a good program also needs to hold the readers' interest. The book itself is black and white, the dialogue stale and unmoving, and there is very little opportunity for listener/speaker interaction. I also speak German and French, and the best way I learn is by incorporating four basic points: listening, reading, speaking and culture. The book offers the first two, but is nearly devoid in the last. I can't imagine using the majority of the conversations in real life. I gave up after 6 chapters and bought Learn Italian the Fast and Fun Way with the audio CD. I'm almost through with that, and it's much better."
5,Excellent! Easiest way to learn a language.,I've wanted to learn Italian for years. These tapes made it easy and fun. They even helped me develop an Italian accent! This was much easier than learning French in school.
4,Glad the picture is back,"Nice to see the original picture is back on this CD. But I was expecting the original recordings from the Bell label on 2 of the songs,especially on ""Could it be magic"",which is the re-edited version we have here;the other one being ""Sweet Life"".Besides those,I think this one is a great buy,filled with songs that were not originally in the album.Plus you get the original picture and the edited picture from the re-release and the original back cover."
4,My ten year old and six year old love it!,"This toy is great for anyone who needs an evil castle. My two sons both enjoy it. It includes two cannonballs for its catapult, which I thought was neat. It goes great with action figures, especially schleich and papo knights. When I finished consructing it,(with my sons' help)it was much bigger then we'd expected. Construction is quick and easy, but you will need a phillips screwdriver. If you're thinking about buying this, I suggest you do(unless you don't like skulls. They're everywhere!)!"
5,Every single recipe in this book is awesome!,"I previously had this book, lent it out and it never came back. I was sooo happy to find a copy on Amazon! The book arrived in perfect condition and it came really fast. The Angel cookies are so great, the Chocolate Crackle cookies made with a chocolate cake mix are so delicious and stay moist and chewy, we make them every year at Christmas. Every recipe that I've made from this cookbook is a winner!"
5,Personal Encounters in Early Iraq,"Personal account of a lifetime in the Middle East, beginning in the very early 1900s. Told from a first-person perspective, it is a biography immersed i the modernization of the Middle East and shows the changes brought by war, and by oil wealth."
1,didn't like it,"ok, now I love all the other Glutino products I have tried....except these. I HATE these and I could have cried for the money I wasted on them. They are just plain terrible."
5,The East meets the heavy bass drum.,This CD is the bomb for those who truly dig music from other cultures. Traditional music is given a twist with the added modern bass drum beats. The rhythm is rather hypnotic. You can either groove to it or drift off into never-neverland. If you like Deep Forest then you'll most definitly like Agricantus.
3,rating,"Although I personally do not own this album,after listening to samples, I find this music to be quite ethereal. I am a fan of Enigma, so if one is also, then I would recommend this album and group. I also love the music of Tartit which is the group for which Fadimata Walet Oumar is a part of. Weltweit, interested me because she does some vocals on it. All in all, Agricantus is quite good and unique."
3,Too Sesame sez me,"I bought this bar along with my favorite, the Honeybar Natural Trail Mix, just for something different and while it's good, it has too many sesame seeds for my taste."
2,Not great!,"I much prefer his two ""standard"" albums and purchased this one only for the ""Low Down"" unplugged version."
3,Only half,"The songs were there on one side but there was no video which should have been included on the ""B"" side. It wasn't noted on the seller's site."
3,DVD Stereo side,"OK it's not in surround, bummer right, actually this is a very good sounding stereo versions. I was pleasantly surprised. Recommended if you like mellow! Boz & can get it cheap & don't hate dual disc. It's actually a bit too mellow for me right at the moment but it might be just right at some point in the future, who knows, sounds good anyway."
5,Classics Revisited and Given New Life (4.5 stars),"This album, technically, is not new. Having been recorded over five years ago and released only in Japan, Scaggs chooses to revisit a number of his classic tunes -an unplugged ""Lowdown,"" ""Sierra,"" ""Harbor Lights"" and an glorious "" We're All Alone""among others- and record them again under a moodier, at times even bluesier, light. Think of some place between ""But Beautiful"" and a more acoustic ""Desire,"" if you are comparing albums.The core band, as well as the string arrangements, are tuned in to Scaggs' intent and contribute a great backdrop for his voice, which sounds quite great throughout these versions, the best example being the new take on ""Simone.""So, this is not quite a new album, we know the songs and it comes out after a long and inexplicable domestic delay, but the music contained here is pure Boz, sometimes at his best."
2,Mick Foley Mad man that needs a Mask.(hairy and fat too!),Video is boring.Shows some of Foleys dumbest matches that are long forgotten and have been flushed down the toilet just like his career!
3,Not quite what I expected,"I consider myself to be a huge Michael Penn fan and I was eagerly awaiting the release of this album. However, after listening to it, I can say that I'm a bit disappointed with it. I have Michael Penn's first three albums, and the thing I loved about those albums was that there were at least 2 songs on each that had such catchy melodies that after hearing them once, I would never forget them and keep singing them in my mind. None of the songs on MP4 are nearly as catchy as his others like ""Try,"" ""Bunker Hill,"" or my all-time favorite song ""No Myth,"" which I consider one of the best and most beautiful songs ever written. However, after listening to this album a dozen times, I can say that ""Lucky One"" and ""Out of its Misery"" are two of the better/catchier songs on the album. I'm a person who loves catchy melodies, and this album doesn't quite have them like his previous ones did."
2,Not Good Enough,"I'm a long-time fan of Michael Penn. I loved March and Free For All, but liked Resigned less than the first two. MP4 continues the sad backslide that Resigned started. While it used to be difficult to pick out songs that I didn't like on his albums, unfortunately the situation is reversed now, and I have a hard time picking any song that stands out on MP4. A lot of these songs seem like weaker imitations of previous songs. For example, ""High Time"" seems to shamelessly steal part of its melody from ""Try"" on Resigned. MP4 suffers from tens of other little nagging similarities. On top of that, nothing on MP4 really rocks. There is no energy in any of the songs - no strained vocals, no compelling guitar solos, no driving drum beats, and the words just aren't clever enough to make up for the weak music."
2,Watered down and bland,"Where's the hooks?Michael Penn is a gifted songwriter/musician and this album is the low point of his career.It has an VH1 mediocrity to it.There's two good songs on the album.Thankfully Michael rebounds with his superior 2005 album, ""Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947""."
2,Please Edit !,"I enjoy Jance's plotlines. HOWEVER, I do wish someone would pay attention to how her series evolve.With Beaumont, she loses track of her characters ages and time doesn't flow. For instance, in one book a 6 yr old boy is rescued from a closet. THEN, a couple years later (in Beau's life) there is a ""sulky teenager"" attening a funeral. THE SAME CHILD has aged many years in just 2 years.This type of thing happens so often in her books, both Beau and Brady. Lack of cohesion ruins the ""movie"" in one's head.... drops us right back in the reality of the theater.PLEASE use an editor and a timeline !!!!"
4,J.P. Beaumont Needs to come out of retirement,"Having read all of the previous J.P. Beaumont mysteies, I couln't wait for the publication of Birds of Prey. The story was well written but the character had changed. While Beaumont was a member of the Seattle Police Department, he was a better than average detective. Judith Jance made each book exiciting and each novel was distinctive in its presentation of the case. Even though the Birds of Prey was well written, just the fact that the reader knew that Beaumont was no longer a member of the force, tended to down play the story. While Jance kept the story moving and gave great attention to unfolding the mystery, I think most of her readers would agree that J.P. Beuamont needs rejoin the force or at least hire out in some form of law enforcement. Hopefully, if Jance writes any more J.P. Beaumont novels the main character will once again be sworn."
3,First time reader of J.A. Jance,"This was the first book I read by J.A. Jance. I enjoy a good detective story. J.P. Beaumont was a likeable character; a retired cop. (It's funny how a cop tries to go on vacation or retire, but the crime always find the cop anyway). The setting on a cruise ship bound for Alaska made this story different from most.The story was interesting but I felt bogged down by so much background and detail on non-essential people. There seemed to be a lot of setting up of things we just didn't need to know. Then later in the story a character, who we have no background on, just plops in and suddenly becomes very important. This was frustrating. Why spend so much time setting up all those other characters, then not set this one up at all?I was disappointed with the ending. It came too fast without enough information to back up the resolution."
3,First time reader of J.A. Jance,"This was the first book I read by J.A. Jance. I enjoy a good detective story. J.P. Beaumont was a likeable character; a retired cop. (It's funny how a cop tries to go on vacation or retire, but the crime always find the cop anyway). The setting on a cruise ship bound for Alaska made this story different from most.The story was interesting but I felt bogged down by so much background and detail on non-essential people. There seemed to be a lot of setting up of things we just didn't need to know. Then later in the story a character, who we have no background on, just plops in and suddenly becomes very important. This was frustrating. Why spend so much time on all those other characters, then not set this one up equally?I was disappointed with the ending. It came too fast without enough information to back up the resolution."
4,Impossible Situation ?,"I love Jance's books. But one particular detail in this one has me forgetting what else I liked about the book and obsessing on the detail. In the book, an Alzheimer's patient is pushed off the rear platform of a train when the train is in a tunnel. It is supposedly too dark to see who did the pushing. The Alzheimer's patient ends up dead, at the bottom of a canyon. How does one fall off a train in a dark tunnel and end up at the bottom of a canyon in broad daylight? If it weren't for this, I would definitely give this five stars!"
3,Almost For The Birds!,"I have read everyone J.P. Beaumont mystery and feel this is the most disappointing. ""Beau"" was his usual likable self but the surrounding characters were lacking. And the story was just too flat along with the conclusion. Because Ms Jance is one of my favorite authors, I still look forward to her next ""J.P. Beaumont"" mystery. If it comes close to ""Breach of Duty"", it should be a winner."
4,Good read- typical Beaumont,"A good read for sitting around the fire or cruising. As always J.P. Beaumont is a flawed competent cop you want toroot for all the time. Good pace, grandparents on their honeymoon are funny and characters breeze in and out ofthe story bringing complications and interest. A cruise, to chaperone the honeymooner, turns into two tragediesand mysterious characters and places. If you are not a fan of the series, this could make you one and if you are a fan this one does not disappoint."
2,Jance can't write male characters,I have been reading the Beaumont series from the beginning because I am from Seattle and I enjoyed the local references but it became apparent early on that Jance was clueless about male characters. In Birds of Prey it reaches a new low. Beaumont come across like a crabby old woman and is totally unbelievable as a male character. Jance writes what she thinks men are like but she misses the mark and her characters' effeminate nature makes it hard to read.
1,Boring,I am on page 170. One person has disappeared. I am hoping something else will happen before the end of the book if I make it that far
2,Definately not on par with other J.A. Jance novels,"Boring!! I was disappointed. In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book. That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around. I just could not do it with this book."
3,Decent but Different,"I've read this book a couple times and it really isn't Jance's best. Actually it doesn't even come close. Beaumont, the main character is still present but that's where the similarities to a lot of the other books really end. I do have to recognize the author's talent in capturing a cruise along the inside passage from Seattle to Alaska. Jance did a great job of portraying the sites and sounds of the cruise as well as some of the little cities along the trip. Overall though it was not enough to make up for the struggling storyline that this novel provides. As a long time fan of Beau and Jance I know I will probably read this book again, just probably not in the near future."
2,boring,"this book started off very slow, nothing happens 'till a third of the way through the book. the writer seems to think she can write from a male perspective but this guy doesn't think like a guy at all. way to descriptive of things that don't benefit the story. i felt like i was trapped on a cruise ship with all these old people and i couldnt get off. it barely held my interest enough to finish it."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the rave reviews here, I expected to be enthralled. I wasn't. The writing is unsophisticated to the point of being boring. The subjects of sibling rivalry and whether David is communicating from heaven or not are driven into the ground. I read the entire book, but midway through, began wondering why I was wasting my time. Hoping to be rewarded with new depth of plot? A twist of some sort to grab my imagination? Alas, no reward."
4,Daughter of Destiny,"Benazir Bhutto's autobiography expands upon and explains the backstory of current headlines about her country. A brilliant woman and political leader, she was unable to escape the fate service to her fractured nation required of her. Reading about her life in her own words certainly heightens appreciation for and understanding of her contributions to the world scene."
2,Melodramatic,"At first, the book seemed to evoke a certain sense of sympathy from the reader as Benazir seemed to suffer a great deal from the Martial Law regime. However, seeing her in office twice, has raised serious credibility issues. In my opinion the real oppressor of Pakistan was not General Zia but ASIF ALI ZARDARI, who has ""sucked"" every penny from the Treasury and left more than 120 million people to starve"
4,three ways to the power,"Exciting book, really interesting story. Just read this book as three different ways (always linked)to target to the power: Ms Bhutto riformist way, the mother's bureaucratic way, the brother's revolutionary. And read Rushdie's Shame before or immediately after."
2,"Jane Eyre, the boring tale of a pointless existance.","A novel about a young girl named Jane Eyre who who falls in love with Mr. Rochester. The over-detailed environments and the pointless conversations do not contribute to the reader's entertainment. I don't really care about the meaningless conversations which persitently appear throughout this story. I had to fight the overwhealming boredom of this novel, and once fell asleep reading the tale."
2,Searching for a good book on Washington - don't buy this one,"I am under the belief that the people that wrote favorable reviews for this book were related to Harrison Clark (the author).Although the book contains a lot of great information, the format, the grammar, and the lack of good maps limits the readers understanding.format - there were times when the text was so disjointed that I had to reread sections several times and sit down with pen an paper to map out his ideas.grammar - the author, for example, will tell a story about several men. When continuing the story about one man specifically Harrison will refer to the person as ""him"" without letting the reader know which of the men to whom he is making the reference.maps - The author refers to a lot of places, but doesn't map them out so it is hard to gain an understanding of what is happening in the book.If you haven't purchased this book - don't. Given Harrison's creditials this book is a disappointment."
2,Not very Good,"Brief review. This Anime is only 3 episodes long. But from the size of the box you'd swear it was at least 15. The anime is not very good. Not much is really hashed out. Also you never really get attached to any characters. I bought only because the promos off Toonami years ago looked good. I missed this years ago and thought I was making a good purchase.Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Not very entertaining, very short. Also only one episode on each disc, and episodes are only 30 minutes long. This comes on double sided DVD's also, which I hate. Plus ending is very unsatisfying. Watch on the internet somewhere, or better yet just forget about. Along with Outlaw Star, (Which I disliked after about episode 14), this anime will probably never be watched by me again. I may even sell it someday, something I never do with movie purchases.You have been warned.Hope this review pursuades you to spend you money on something else."
4,worth the money!,"for the amount it costs its really worth it..it has all 4 OVAs plus a lot of extra material...the graphics are excellent and the plot ties in well over the 4 OVA period, a bit lame sometimes but thats anime for you..all in all a very good buyJoseph Paul Vella (Malta, Europe)"
2,"Just dindt like the story, the animation, nor the overall premise....sorry","For lack of a better word the story sucked; it was very dry and convoluted, and the whole half woman/fish naked thing was a little creepy and gross. I wish I would have pirated this movie first before buying it. You can watch online first, then if you like you can buy it. To each his own."
2,Good Show. Horrible DVD Format,Blue Submarine No. 6 is a good mini series with a fascinating style of animation. The only qualm i have with the product is the A and B side use of the discs. i new that the product had three discs but only one episode is on each side of the discs. This is an unnecessary feature because it's a mini series and doesn't need to have an A and a B side for four episodes. This neglects any option for disc art too!There is no where on the information page of the DVD collection that describes this feature/fault.To be honest. i would not have bought this product knowing i would have to get up and either flip the disc or change the disc after each and every episode. You also have to set the language and subtitles. You have to sit through the animation and production company logos that you cannot skip through on each episode.
3,"beautiful, but stock","When i was but a wee one i saw BS6 when it aired for the first time in America on cartoon network (rock on). Then it never aired again... ever. When i saw it on Amazon i had no choice but to get it. I wasn't disappointed, but the dialog leaves something to be desired, and the entire storyline seems rushed. The visuals on the other hand are astounding, some of the best i have ever seen. Its more of a rental than a classic, but its pretty cheap."
4,Great anime!,"I must start by saying that I was looking for this series for a long time, since I only caught one or two episodes when it was broadcasted, and considered it cool! So I didn't hesitate to get this copy.Boy! It is a great series. I loved every minute of it. First I saw it in english, later in japanese with english subtitles. Trust me, it's better in the original language! The voice-overs sound really cool, very emotional.The 3D sections were impressive (remember this was in made last century...), and in general the atmosphere was outstanding. Kudos to the japanese creators for that.I sincerely recommend it."
5,blue submarine No.6,i was surprised when it came in the case the DVD is double sided so make sure its the right side before you watch or it gets confusing(it happen to me) ^_^ well anyway the story is beautifully told i liked watching it in japanese with eng sub's and the ending is heart breaking if you in to romance mixed with exciting underwater submarine battles with all kinds of things then this is for you.
2,"iUniverse, shame on you!","Daniel Hardie's ""The Loudest Trumpet"" is a valuable and informative book extremely poorly produced. There is no evidence of its having been proof read, the dearth of commas throughout the text makes it difficult to read, the photographs and musical examples are poorly printed.That Mr. Hardie's excellent work should be so poorly presented is shameful. He has been ill served by his publisher."
5,I remember this music.,I heard the Set U Free from Planet Soul when I was in 5th grade and I was singing it at school.
5,AWESOME LIVE TUBBS!,I WAS BLOWN AWAY AFTER HEARING THIS ALBUM. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS LISTENED (AND LISTENED) TO ALMOST ALL OF TUBBY'S RECORDED OUTPUT I FOUND THIS LIVE DATE TO BE AMOUNG THE BEST OF ANY OF HIS RECORDINGS- AS IT FINDS AN EXTREEMLY UNRESTRAINED HAYES JUST BLOWING THE WALLS DOWN. A MUST FOR ANY FAN OF JAZZ TENOR. UTTERLEY COMPELLING MUSIC FROM A SADLY NEGLECTED JAZZ GENIUS.
3,A must for fans of Tubby Hayes.,Tubby Hayes in a typically live club date. Hayes is in good form. The added bonus is NHOP on bass.
1,save your money!!,"I was so excited when this DVD came out hoping to get the four Pittsburgh Steelers highlight films from the '70s. 98% of all this material is already included in the Super Bowl Collection Sets put out last year on DVD. Why won't NFL Films step up and give us more??? This should be a STEELER-SPECIFIC box set, not some rehash of the entire season for all teams...Come On Steve Sabol; give us what we want!!!"
2,Not what you think it is,"As the previous reviewer wrote, this DVD only shows the NFL Films version of Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV. It does also have a short profile of Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, Chuck Noll, and a couple others. They are only about 2-3 minutes a piece though. The league season highlights are horrible. Who cares about the other teams. I bought this because it was supposed to be about the Steelers. Wish I could get my money back. Gave it two stars instead of only one because of the profile on Lambert, he was the best."
3,Steelers: 1970's Dynasty!,"I bought the DVD figuring that it would include the Steelers 1974, 1975, 1978 & 1979 season highlights, plus the Super Bowl Championship Highlights. Instead, we got to see the NFL season highlights of those four Super Bowl seasons. Not a complaint by any means. I'm sure there are people disappointed about the DVD, but I'm not one of those. I guess being a loyal Stllers and NFL fan, especially in the 1970's, people can see how good those other teams were, and just how great the Steelers became."
1,Cannot recommend,"Unfortunately, I cannot endorse this DVD any longer. As this was a chance for TonalVision to produce their first DVD and served as a learning experience for them, the production is indeed shoddy, the quality is mediocre, and does not reflect the high quality of work to which I constantly aspire.Also, the information divulged is out-dated at this time, which is the nature of digital technology.Please keep an eye out for ""Visual LIteracy"" to be released in fall 2006."
3,Disappointed,"Tony Sweet does very impressive photographic work, so I was quite surpised by the poor quality of this DVD. I guess this is the fault of the production company, but the quality of this DVD is no better than what your cousin does with his new video recorder at family reunions. I was also disappointed by the fact that Tony didn't speak more to the viewer. He was simply filmed giving his talks and at times it was hard to understand him or even see what he was doing. Having said these things, if one pays close attention and really looks and listens, a great deal can be learned from this DVD. That's the reason I will keep it. It's just a shame that the producers didn't spend more time on it because they could have made this a real winnner. Tony Sweet's photography is wonderful. This DVD is not."
5,More accessible than the rest.,"As I was reading this text, (mind you just for fun, and for the enjoyment of my own personal endeavors) I could not help but notice that this textbook is easy to understand. If this book was given to someone with no knowledge of philosophy,(the beginning student for example)he/she would have an easier time of understanding that eternal question, ""What is philosophy?"" The chapters are well written,often using humorous yet, thought provoking quotes alongside the text. I really would recommend this book to someone who wants to venture toward attaining an understanding of philosophy. Everything in life I believe branches off from philosophia, this book allows you to understand that.- enrique de la Garza III"
5,"Profoundly Beautiful, Transcending, and Magical",Alert.....My review is already up. Can I access it somehow to add a sentence?
5,Pull Your Lover Close...,"This is a CD that needs two people to listen to it. It creates an atmosphere pregnant with love, ripe for both giving and receiving. When it is storming outside and all the lights in the bedroom are off while a lone candle is lit and burning across the room, turn this CD on, pull your lover close, breathe deeply and close your eyes: you'll experience the eternal in a timeless moment.It really is that good.Every track moves with a rugged and tender beauty, largely due to Tillman's rustic cello as Wheater's flute dances and soars above it. At times they are like two complementary yet dynamic forces creating the beauty of the song through their (always positive) tension with each other. Hoppe's composing is absolutely fantastic, always giving the necessary bed of orchestration for Tillman and Wheater to dance their dance.If it is true that beauty leads one to contemplate the eternal, then this CD will lead you and your lover to a banquet for the soul."
1,too short a sample to evaluate,Sample of recording is too short to evaluate cd for purchasing. The song just starts and then cuts off. At the mall I can get a good sample of the whole cd.
2,"Lots of demonstration, not useful for beginners","The first third of this is a useful intro to the instrument, covering the basics of how to hold the pick and so on. But when it comes to the songs its just a run through at speed, not broken down in a way that helps you learn. If you're an intermediate to advanced and want to see how somebody else plays these song it might be useful, but beginners will just be frustrated by the speed. It takes most people a while to get to that level, and if you're already there you probably don't need the first half of this video that tells you how to hold the instrument, so its really not a good value for the money. Try either the Casey or Cochran videos instead."
5,Dive Bomb,"This was the second energon toy I bought. I bought it because I felt like I should have an energon decepticon to battle my signal flare toy. This toy is actually pretty good though. None of his parts fell off but his weapon wears down over time if you constantly take apart his energon weapon. His weapon fits in much bigger figures hands like megatron, mega-octane, etc. The terrorcons and omnicons are good toys to start out with and look good in any collection. The only thing I disliked was how he doesn't have a weapon if you attach his energon weapon to a bigger figure."
3,The Galveston Horror,"Never knew about all of this and that's not a good thing being from Texas. However, it has made me want to read more books concerning other areas of Texas."
1,Take an English class,"I am glad that this was a free book because if I had paid any money for it, I would have been very upset. The author needs to learn how to use punctuation. When a sentence is more than 2 paragraphs long, the reader's brain starts to cry for oxygen. The use of imagery is so over the top that I struggled to get passed the 1st couple of pages. I stopped reading at page 6 due to the frustrating run-on sentences. Hated it!!"
4,Case,"If you've lost the case your DS game came in, these are worth it. Of course, nothing can compare with the box the games were built for, but still, if yours are broken or such, get these"
2,(T_T),My Emoticon in the subject title says it all. Although this product carries your DS games nicely. They are loose and can easily fall out or in my case when you open the case they go flying out. The case closes shut very tightly *sometimes a little too tight* but I'd recommend getting the Game Case that holds 6 and has a picture of your favorite gaming character and use these Game Cases to hold your not so actively played games. Other wise it's up to you if you wanna buy this case.
4,Not bad,These are handy little cases. Would prefer if games stayed in place when you opened the case. Other then that they serve the purpose well for the price. I'll probably buy more as I need them.
5,A worthy investment,"These were even smaller than I thought they'd be, which is great. The cases take up virtually no space, and are quite sturdy. This was a three pack, which means room for nine DS games. Overall, a good value and a good product."
5,Exceptional photography,"'This book contains photographs of mainly piercing but also tattoos. The photographs range from a variety of genital and facial piercings. Has very big, clear pictures. Excellent quality. When i bought it i expected it to have writing so I was disapointed to get a book that solely contained photographs. However if what you are interested is a book with pictures and nothing else this is a very good choice. It contains very nice detailed closeups and is really a pleasure to look through."
5,so pretty and handy!,"i love these bowls. they are a really pretty color, easy to clean, and having these 3 sizes is very necessary. plus, they stack perfectly!ps-if you end up getting/have the 4 qt bowl, these stack perfectly inside too!"
5,A powerful saint,"Excerpts from any of the writings of St. Catherine of Sienna represent to me a true and succinct revelation of Catholic Church thinking and history of former times, and resonate with me. I learned of this book in ""Magnificat"",which often quotes her. The Prayers of St. Catherine of Sienna has met my expectations. I also bought and recommend the Dialogue of St. Catherine of Sienna and the Letters of st. Catherine of Sienna."
2,Does not get hot enough.,"This pen comes with one permanently attached tip and 4 others that screw on to the permanent tip. The permenant tip, a sort of diagonal blade works fine if allowed to heat for 20+ minutes. However, the screw on tips never got hot enough to make a mark even when left to heat for an hour."
1,WOOD BURNING SET,"I am very unhappy with this item. Yes, it does get HOT but not hot enough to burn all tyes of wood. Possibly it is good on a real soft wood like balsam; however, it did not burn at all on our deck. My grandson wanted to carve his initials in the deck raling that he and his ""papa"" built and this did not work at all!"
4,My first woodburner EVER!,"With nothing to compare it to, I can't, in good conscience, give this product five stars. So I gave it four.The safety rest is different than the one pictured, but the product is a fine one. I like it, and it is easy to use."
5,Wood Burning Scirbe Set,I couldn't ask for more. My grandsons were very pleased with their gift.So was my husband. Looks like they will all start becoming pyrogrophers.
4,Works well for the money,"For the price this works well. Used it to make some simple driftwood art. The tip tends to loosen up and it could be hotter, but for the money it works fine and comes with a nice assortment of accessories. I have recommended it to a few friends."
2,wobbly,"We bought this wood burning kit for a small craft project. We honestly chose it because it was cheap. When we put the tips on and started using it they were extremely wobbly, so it was hard to put pressure on it because it felt like it was going to break. Also it felt like it needed pressure because it didn't get very hot. It wasn't an important craft project so we kept the kit, but the burning looks really bad."
2,Tip keeps coming loose... :(,It get hot enough and all but the tip keeps coming loose right in the middle of wood burning... I am afraid I may burn myself in the future...
5,Excellent!!!,I have listened to several of his works and everything that I have heard is wonderful!! This one is definately one of his best works. I put this CD on when I just want to relax. The music is so soothing. I'm looking forward to purchasing more of Ed Van Fleet in the near future.
4,Native pick me up,Feeling kinda down and out? Got the winter blues? Pick up a copy of this CD. it's great. The native nature of this music is up lifting and some what spiritual. Pop it in the cd player and soothe those winter blues away! definately worth adding to your collection.
3,Well Done!,"Recently I had all of my CD's stolen and as I was going through the ones I wanted to replace this came up. One of the CD's I enjoy listening to for hours, it is very relaxing and calming. Certainly an excellent job by Ed, I love his blending of sounds."
2,disappointing,"Ordered this product only because it had an acrylic case and an armband. Within 2 days of using the armband at the gym the velcro pads peeled off on removing the band. Now its useless because it doesn't even superglue!Could have bought another case, but this served both purposes, protection and the armband I so wanted. What a bummer. Bad quality product from agent 18."
1,Battery operated candle,"This would be a nice piece, but it was defective and poorly made. I have bought another candle by this company and had no problems, so maybe it is ""hit or miss."" The piece was expensive and did not work. The battery housing did not close with the battery in it and the light would not come on. Customer service was responsive and the return process went well. The candle is a nice shape with a vanilla aroma. Perfect for areas that do not allow open flames--such as hospitals and nursing homes--or areas with little children or pets."
5,Great candle!,"I have several of these candles, very realistic flickering and color. I have had no problems with any of my candles. I am slowly replacing all of my real candles with these since there is no wax, no clipping wicks, no strange melting forms, and no worries if you leaving them running for days and days and days! The kids (2 and 4 years old) love them in their rooms, very comforting. They are a bit pricey but you get thousands of hours out of them as compared to the handful of hours from regular candles so I think it is definitely worth it."
3,Warning: Elvis Does NOT Sing On This CD!!!,"I absolutely love the current Elvis Remixes that are making the rounds from XL JUNKIE, SPANKOX and Viva La Elvis to the new one RE:VOLUTION. I can't get enough of them, but there is one criteria that I must insist on. And that is that Elvis' voice is used, otherwise it ain't Elvis. This CD sounds like a Trent Reznor impersonator singing lead with gothic female backup singers and a more than decent mechanical synth chugging type musical backdrop with hints of guitar when needed. I must admit I like it and am getting into it as I like my heavy synth/goth metal ala Marilyn Manson. But I would have loved it more if this was done with Elvis' Voice... Heavy Metal Elvis, if done well it would sound awesome I bet. E.P. ENTERPRISES probably wouldn't approve. Oh well maybe in the not too distant future.Without Elvis it's only half the experience: 2.5 Stars."
5,the partisans of vilna dvd,This documentary dvd The Partisans of vilna is an incredible story of the human spirit. Everyone should see this DVD. It is very well done. It should be shown in all schools as well to see the bravery of these young people.
4,Great Movie! Right in line with Fists of white lotus and 5 Deadly venoms,If you like the other 2 movies I've named in the subject then you will like this one. THere's a little bit of profanity and it's somewhat of a change from your average kung-fu movie. Amazon doesn't seem to make Ninja Death II & III availbe (which you will need.. it's a 3-movies series). I found a copy on ebay (in case your wondering where to get them).
4,Dragon wings Air deflectors,Kinda hard to open but a great product.Nice to have air flow on those hot days would recommend to anyone
1,Not So Easy Gospel Guitar from Musicians-Workshop,"The description of the contents of this DVD sound great. However, I cannot figure out how to play guitar lessons on my Windows XP PC.I ran the installer that comes with the DVD, and a ""DVD@cess"" service is installed, but when I try to double-click on the installed media file, I get the message: ""Windows Media Player cannot play this DVD because a compatible DVD decoder is not installed on your computer."" I'm not sure what to do. On my current PC I have no problem playing DVD's.The contents of the DVD are probably great, however, the people at Musicians-workshop.Com should take a look at how user-friendly the eMedia people put their training DVDs together. It would be much better in my opinion to install their software the way most software is installed--on the Start menu and to supply any missing drivers."
3,Where's the Sherpa?,The bed is nice but where is the Sherpa? The reason I purchased this bed was because of the Sherpa. Very misleading for the product description.
1,very misleading,I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about? Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.NFL Super Bowl Collection: Dallas Cowboys
5,willis a winner,"I'm not a huge fan of traditional-sounding coutnry music, and for that reason this CD won't live in my player. But I gotta give it 5 stars because the excellence of it is undeniable. Kelly is the real deal if you are looking for a strong female singer of straight-up country shorn of extensive production. Like I said, it has a traditional sound, but cna definitely be listened to by other fans. This stuff is most definitely not hokey or corny. Kelly can really sing and put energy into the faster stuff [there's a good amount of it here] and genuine emotion into slower stuff [Kelly can do ballads great]. Country fans most definitely need this."
1,shame on Baby Einstein,"Animals around me is the same DVD, roughly, as ""World Animals"" and ""Baby McDonald"" DVD's put together. If you have those, don't get this. I mean- SERIOUSLY- they didn't even try to make it different with the exception of a few new inserts to assist in the transitions between exerpts from the two older DVDs. Booooooooo! We received this as a gift because my mother knew how much my girls loved Baby Einstein and she was led to believe that this, along with ""World of Colors"" (aka Baby Van Gogh"" and ""World of Words"" (with repurposed material from older DVDs as well), was a new series of DVDs. I feel like I was just extorted. Will not purchase any more Baby Einstein DVDs."
5,You can't go wrong with Baby Einstein,"I discovered the Baby Einstein products when I began babysitting for my 3 month old grandson. Even at that early age he was fascinated with the movies, and learned unusual and complicated words (xylophone, gyroscope for example) at a very early age. He watched these movies right up to almost 4 yrs old and really learned a lot from them. So with a new grandbaby in the family, I purchased this set to introduce her to Baby Einstein, and hope that she gets as much from it as her cousin did. I love the fact this set also comes with the music CD (which I used to have to buy separately) and the book. A great opportunity for parents and grandparents to interact with the child and the DVD movie. I highly recommend these Baby Einstein products."
2,Boring zzz,"My daughter is 2 yrs. old and doesn't like to watch it. This is my first Einstein video. I will not buy another. Friends have told me that they are great, but I just watched it myself and it is not fun. I recommend leapfrog dvd's."
3,Rediculously Simple...but...,My little guy loves it and it keeps him occupied for 20 mins or so. (He does not watch that much TV) It is quite a simple/rudimentary video but you have to remember it’s for babies/toddlers. I would say it’s suitable for children under 2. Obviously anyone can watch it and not be offended but the littlest kids will find it surprisingly entertaining.Should be priced about $10.
2,"Just like ""Baby Shakespeare""","This is a variation of Baby Einstein's Shakespeare DVD. The first few minutes started out just like it. I haven't watched anymore because I was so disgusted I had to walk away. But I am VERY, TRULY disappointed. I feel ripped off...like they should have warned the buyers in the product description."
4,Pretty slick,"For some reason, I didn't think these fit me properly at first and was intending to return them. But after trying them again with different socks, they seemed to fit much better. I like the rustic look of the suede and the general cut of the boot. They seemed true to size."
4,A Witness to the Faithful Life,This book is a year's journal of the experiences of an inner-city Roman Catholic parish priest. MacNamee writes of profound experiences with a style of deceptive sparseness. Read it slowly. Absorb the rich spirituality that the author reveals in his faithful day-to-day ministry among the very poor. A wonderful book!
5,An Inspirational Read,"""Sparse"" is a good word to describe McNamee's writing here. Looking over the devastation of human lives that litter our inner cities, McNamee tells of the pain and loss, but he also sees hope. To this hope, in the midst of a daily grind, does he cling. This hope embraces the pain and loss that he sees daily and allows him to continue to minister effectively. Immersed in classical Catholic mysticism and spirituality since his seminary days, I love his phrase: ""One must be a contemplative to work in the inner-city."" This is a great book about committing to a difficult place for the long haul. I'd love to meet McNamee one day; he seems a real fine priest."
5,Awesome!,"This is one book I did not want to finish reading, only because when it ended I knew there would not be anymore. From the beginning and all the way through I felt as though I was experiencing each happening along with all of the characters. What is amazing is how Ms. Crater was able to infuse so much truth into a 'fiction' novel. I look forward to reading future novel's from Ms. Crater!"
5,notes from a librarian on Under the Stone Paw,"There really is a chamber under the Stone Paw of the Sphinx. I saw it on the Discovery channel once! The stories about the Le Clair family are legendary as they trace their lineage back to Mary Magdalene. But...what if those stories were linked to other great legends? They may be connected to other stories from other times and perhaps other places such as Tibet, Egypt, or South America. What if those connections are even interstellar? Did you know about the complex tunnel systems under the Giza plateau? Do you know what's waiting at the temple at Karnac or what power and memories can be held in a bit of crystal? This compelling insightful novel might fit on any fantasy, esoteric fiction, science fiction, thriller, archeological fiction, historical fiction, or adventure shelf. You will love it."
2,Disappointing...,"The fact that it was written by an ""eminent historian"" does not make up for the serious weak points this book possesses. Its description misleads the reader into believing the book will contain personal, detailed accounts of the last Tsar's family life, but all it contains are common general knowledge statements. What Ferro does seem to concentrate on is Nicholas's political life--particularly its failures. He seems to nitpick at the Tsar's every weak point, and the only thing Ferro does well is unfairly bash the character of this most noble emperor. This book is bland; it reads like a boorish supermarket tabloid--and just as trashy"
1,A one star is overrating this thing,"Not only does the book have BIG print, few pages, and lots of fluff, it is both historically and culturally incorrect. It surmises that the Revoution was inevitable due to the actions of the ruling Tsar - WRONG. The Revolution occurred because of Lenin and WWI. In 1913, Russia's economy was fastest growing in Europe. She had liberalized and was coming into the modern world. Lenin's propaganda railed at military losses when in fact she was successful on 3 of the 4 fronts where she was engaged.The section headings, ""Rule by Rasputin"", ""Nicholas rejects the Russians"", etc says a lot about the historicity of this work. It does not even explain the Revolution well and how a motley crew of foreign-trained malcontents took control of the vast Russian Empire. For a good work ont he subject of the Romanons get NICHOLAS and ALEXANDRA - excellent work."
1,Garbage,"If you think that Trotsky, Lenin and Stalin were the best products of the 20th Century, then this is the book for you. Those folk turned the world into hell but since Ferro is a ""socialist"" what they did was natural and good. NII's greatest failing was not liberalizing in time in WWI but Russia, and the world, did not deserve the incredible evil that replaced him. And, no, the peasants, workers and army did not benefit either, unless one thinks that the Russian civil war and the gulag were fun times and places."
2,It lost me early,"It began with Nicholas II (for a paragraph) then went to his great-great grandfather, then to his great grandfather and then to his grandfather and then to his father. You get all this before they even mention anything about the guy the biography is about! I felt as if i was reading a fiction story - all the discription of each event (like the hunting.) There was no biographical facts - it's all stories."
1,Do not trust Chapmans Books,"I ordered this product from Chapmans Books in Derry, New Hampshire and I did not like it so I was allowed to return it. I sent it back, never received a refund and when I try to call and ask about it they hang up on me. Do not order anything that comes from this seller."
3,melancholy,"i didn'nt the recive de product yet,but the delivery time is to long please letme nkow if i can chnge the delivery time"
4,i love it....,"I love this series of anime...it contains a box that holds two cds and then the volume 1movie,I reccomend this special edittion box if u are a fan or if u just simply love anime,and also the whole thing came brand new,which I liked"
1,Another U.S. brand that has sold out to China!,"Irwin has had a long reputation of quaility tools. No more. You might as well buy a two dollar pair of side cutters that have made in China stamped on them, because these are no different. IRWIN tries to mask their Chinese manufacturing by only stamping ""Made in China"" on the packaging instead of the tool. When it comes to tools, if it does not have ""Made in USA"" or ""USA"" stamped on it, then it was not made in USA. A lot of U.S. brands try to hide their overseas manufacturing by simply omitting the manufacturing stamp. I am not anti China. I think Chinese imports have a place in our economy. However, when I am buying and American brand based on its reputation of quality and I find that they have shipped their manufacturing overseas, that is fraud. The name IRWIN is no longer a symbol of quailty. The next time I need a pair of locking pliers, I will not buy IRWIN Vise-Grips. The brand has no value any more."
5,I consider this Diagonal Cutting Pliers as a Professional Tool,"I consider this tool as a professional tool. The quality is pretty good, the steel is excellent, the handles are comfortable, very sharp, the size is great.I was cutting a negative wire for car batteries (is really thick) without problems, and without pain on my hands.I have one diagonal cutting pliers, but the problem with this one is the size: 6 inches long and the jaws do not have the size to cut thick wires (like wires for car and truck batteries).Great tool!!"
5,do they need a review?,Diagonal pliers aka wire cutters. They do their job. I've owned several pairs of these over the years. Irwin's hold up well for a long time even with daily use. Mainly use them for coax cable cutting.
5,Great for House Wiring and General Wire Cutting,These pliars are great for house wiring and cutting medium wire. Do not use these on hardened wire or large steel wire. I use these to cut house wiring to length because they give me more cutting leverage than Lineman Side Cutter Pliers. It is also easy for me to see exactly where I am cutting and get close to devices when I am cutting. I used them to add two electrical outlets for my cable amplifier and home ethernet network switch. I also use these to cut coax cable when I don't have my cable cutters. I like the insulated handles in case I get into a live wire by mistake.
2,Very bad bussiness,"I`m really angry because this Irwin cutter it`s not that (a cutter) actually it`s a smasher because it smashes the wires but not cut. I already bought 2 but only 1 works as it should be. The one of my partner works fine but mine doesn`t. It`s a shame because I`ve had Irwin products and I`ve been satisfied with Irwin trademark but now I don`t know what happend because I feel very bad with the cutter I bought. So I wouldn`t recomment buying these cutters Irwin, and if you do it let me tell you that it will be like throwing your money into the garbage can. So this seller is not a serious one, and I don`t send it back from here in Costa Rica bacause it`s more expensive and I don`t want to spend more time and money on it. Sorry about my English because I speak Spanish."
5,Beautiful Dress,"I love this dress!! The deataling isn't overbearing and the little bonnet is very cute. I love the way this dress feels too. It doesn't feel cheap like some satiny clothes can feel. The back is tied in a bow, which it doesn't show in the pic. I hate really frilly dresses, but I still wanted something beautiful and I think this dress is a nice balance. This is really the perfect dress for christenings/baptisims/blessings."
1,bad,the dress was beautiful to bad it came in a box that looked like it was in a war and when i took the dress out so did the dress it was filthy on the whole back of dress never again only 3 days left till christening i guess ill be going to the mall
4,Pretty good,It was beautiful. Only complaint would be that the puckers came out on the skirt. I haven't had a chance to repair it. Some of the lace came off also and had to repair it. Other than that it was gorgeous and fun to dress up my girl in.
4,Great book,"This book is an insightful look into the compilation of the New Testament text. It is a good read for anyone considering Christian ministry. Additionally, it will answer many questions brought up by non-Christian scholars concerning the Word of God."
2,"Great performance, poor sound","I had high hopes for this CD...Václav Neumann and the Czech Philharmonic performing Dvorak, but the poor audio mastering ruins any enjoyment of this disc. It's an early digital recording with harsh highs and sounding very thin and lean; Dvorak needs to sound lush and sumptuous. I have a large collection of Dvorak with superior sound, so I wont be ordering the rest of this cycle."
3,"it's okay, the origional is better","It's a remix. Sometimes remixes end up being better than the original . . . not here. Some of these are choice, but it seems that each of these artists chose to remix the same song. So, as an album, it doesn't work. As a collection of singles to be intermittently listened too while being mixed in among similar songs to accommodate a week of listening pleasure, much more effective. Even then, one or two of these songs are about as enjoyable as a hangover, but there is this wonderful ability we have with digital technology . . . skip it."
5,The most awesome EFO experience next to a live show.,"This two CD set is a wonderful mix of their music, they are a great live show and that is captured on this CD set. It is recorded at some of their regular stops on tour, their audience knows them and responds to their energy. You should really check out this CD even if you don't consider yourself a folk music fan. This is the modern incarnation of Folk."
5,One of the best bands on the market!,"Eddie From Ohio creates a mix of folk, great harmonies, and unbeatable personalities that is unmatchable by almost anyone on the music market today. There music is only matched by their willingness to give the best show possible everytime that they are on stage. It is completely evident on the 2 CD set ""The Portable EFO Show."" I'm suprised that the big record companies haven't forced them to make main stream recordings so that they can reach even more people with their fantastic sound."
2,Death By Chocolate - No Sweet Surprises,"As part of a three couple group who have played over 18 of the boxed Murder Mystery games, Death By Chocolate is perhaps the biggest disappointment of them all.While the vast majority of games that we've played have had several twists in the plot and sequences of events that kept us laughing, this one stayed on a relatively mundane course to a foreseeable end.Death By Chocolate includes a video CD as opposed to the usual audio CD, which was a nice touch, but the video information did not match the written character information on a few occasions throughout the game."
4,Great Psy-Trance,"Great album overall, but if you're not yet familiar with Space Tribe I reccomend buying ""2000 O.D"" first. It is, by far, their best work. Still, this is a safe buy and I would reccomend it to anyone who loves full-on Psy-Trance."
1,not same series as pictured.,"the bongo's that i received were not the same as the ones pictured. the item # of the bongos that i actually received is fwb200gab. ....so sam ash, i feel a little misled. i could have bought these for the same price ....just about anywhere else online or the guitar center down the street. i thought that i was buying the very top-o-the-line set that meinl makes. which wasn't the case.--that being said. still love the bongos. meinl makes a killer product. construction of this instrument is beautiful, sound is beautiful. very nice.ill keep them.....just want you to know that the $440 list price is not accurate, and should actually be $219."
1,Completely upset!!!,"I have no words to express my discomfort!! I ordered as the product shows, a 7 inches/8.5 inches bongo but instead, I received a 6.5 inches /8 inches!!! I live in colombia so I can't afford the return charges because it won't make any sense on the final price!!Besides that, no ""Hand selected buffalo heads""!! I received the synthetic white bongo heads as those that come with the ""Meinl Headliner Vintage"".I paid for a 7 inches / 8.5 inches Freeride bongo mounted on buffalo heads and I almost receive just a piece of wood!!I am an amazon's old client but this is enough, I feel cheated and offended by this purchase!! Maybe to amazon I am just ""another client"" but for me is the last mistake on amazon products, thank you!!YOU AMAZON SENT ME THIS!!!!http://www.amazon.com/Meinl-675-inch-8-inch-Freeride-Series/dp/B0007Y5OM8/ref=pd_cp_MI_0"
5,Great Deal!!,"This was an excellent buy, the price was right and it seems to me to be in beautiful , Ya whatever, I tanks for licenses"
1,Bad overcharging function.,"The product works OK, more or less. It suffers from a fatal flaw, however. To prevent overcharging of a battery, any battery charger will stop charging after a while. This charger measures overcharging by how long it has been plugged into the wall (8 hours). To plug a new device into the charger, you have to unplug it from the wall to use again. Also, this does not stop the charger from overcharging a battery, only from overcharging it for FOREVER.There is are reasons why the Apple charger is more expensive. Only one of those reasons is that Apple demands a brand premium. But the bottom line is that the Apple charger is a much better charger."
4,GeForce!,This old card makes my old computer able to handle the old games I have rather well. Just be sure to keep the dust bunnies out or you could end up over heating it.
1,no.,the fact that steve is so obviously under the influence of drugs during the taping is just terrible. an embarasment to the viewers and to himself. playing in his white pyjamas doesn't help either. has the guy no shame..
1,0 Stars,"This is the worst digital thermometer I have ever owned.- There is no on/off button and it's intended to be a clock as well. If I wanted a clock I would have bought a clock. I don't want to have to put new batteries every time I need to use it.- It's quite complicated to use. I needed the manual to change the settings.- It's slow. I would not use it for candy making as I'm 100% sure that once it indicates the right degree, it's too late.- I've owned it for 3 months and used it less than 10 times. It's already broken, the thermometer function does not work anymore (and I was very careful with the probe)."
3,Great Features but it Broke,"I love the features on this thermometer! The timer and temperature alert combination is incredible for cooking because both values are so important. The temp alert allows you cook it internally to perfection but sometimes you want to check it after 20 minutes to make sure it's not over-browning. Great features.First annoyance is that the buttons are hard to press - you have to hit them just right. Not a deal break but annoying. The biggest problem was that a couple weeks after I bought it, the bottom left portion of the LCD broke making the thermometer unreadable. They are replacing the unit but at my own shipping expense. Maybe this one is just a lemon..."
1,not your best option,I compared it to miu analog candy deep frying thermometer. there is no comparison.The miu thermometer simply worked as thermometer should and the digital thing couldn't hold a reading. when i added food the temp. would drop correctly. the cdn couldn't hold a reading or it wouldn't get one to begin with. your better of with a analog if you looking for deep frying.
1,"bought this, but not from UnbeatableSale, Inc","I cannot believe Amazon would allow a company like UnbeatableSale, Inc on their website. To try and charge $32.49 in shipping and handling is just a scam. The product itself works very well. It is very accurate and perfect for frying. No leaning over hot oil to read the temp. Note to Amazon....You need to tighten the belts and look out for who is selling on your site."
3,Round Table,"This table has a great table top surface with nicelegs, also.It's overall appearance is what I hoped for.There was some imperfection under the top and inside a leaf, though.Overall I am glad I bought this affordable table."
5,Excellent,Just what I wanted and great size. Very easy to put together. Exactly looks like to photo in color and design. Good delivery service.
3,Small Oak Table,"This table has a scratch in the tabletop and small ""chunk"" on the edge of the table but is not too noticable. It is the perfect size for a small senior apt. Am looking for chairs to match but only need 2."
3,Lousy packaging,"This is a really nice table and it is fairly easy to put together, that is only if you have all the screws, nuts and lock washers you need. The packaging is so bad that you will be very, very lucky to get all the hardware you will need to finish the job. Really disliked the fact they stapled the living crap out of the bottom of the table to keep it secure in the lousy packaging! You do get a good value with this table, and it is just the right size for my small dining room. However because of the lousy packaging and the fact UPS doesn't care at all about getting a package to you in ONE piece I am forced to give this table a 3 star rating."
4,Little Black Dots is a huge accomplishment,"In Little Black Dots Ms. Baptiste takes the reader with her as she journeys back in time to explore the life experiences of Dominique LeFey in an attempt to realize how she arrived at her present position in life. The reader is swept up in rich language ranging from humor that will have you laughing out loud with Dominique to the deepest pains which will have your hand to your face in disbelief. The intense imagery invoked by Ms. Baptiste's prose unfold before you in powerful storms that cleanse the earth and thousands of Trinidadian immigrants ""wining"" on the Parkway in New York City's Labor Day celebrations. This first novel is truly a triumph for Ms. Baptiste as she explores one woman's life. I am sure that everyone can find one aspect of this novel to relate to."
3,Flamenco not Tango,"This video is listed under the wrong dance. It should be with the flamenco dances not Tango. This video is a mix of Gypsy dances, flamenco dancers, flamenco songs with segments that remind me too much of ""Riverdance"". Solo steps in single, couple, group routines. The music is great at times but it overshadows the dance steps. I have mixed feelings about this video. Some of the dance routines I loved, others I disliked. It did not help when I did not like the principal male dancer. He is good, just not great. Traditional dance steps up to the modern. The camera work at times annoyed me. I will have to view this video several times before I like it. 55 minutes."
5,Baking Dish,I bought this dish as a replacement to a similar one that I broke. It is a wonderful kitchen tool! IT even has a top unlike the first one I had. It shipped the day after I bought it too! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys cooking.
5,"Again, why pay more?",Let's say you lose the ipod shuffle port. For just a few bucks you can replace it with this. Works great and IT'S ALL YOU NEED! I'm amazed how much people will overspend on ipod accessories.
1,hahah,the thing melted when i left it plugged in too long on the pc.ha ha yeah it over heated every time i used it i think
4,Cheap cable that works,Cheap replacement for an iPod shuffle power/data cord. Works just as described. I never noticed any issue with it in the year I owned it.
3,Good,At first I think the company must have lost the order. Because I eventually had to cell them and give them the order number and they had no clue why it wasn't shipped. However they shipped it right out and I got it quickly and it works great.
1,Doesn't work,"I guess what you see is what you get. I bought this thing, plugged it into the computer and shuffle...and nothing. It doesn't work. Humbly went to the Apple store to buy the Apple branded counterpart...and that one worked.So, $3 isn't a lot...but it's still $3 down the drain..."
1,USB FOR APPLE 2ND GENERATION,"Item does not charge. None of the aftermarket USB products is able to charge you IPOD suffle. Need to purchage actual apple charger. I tried one from Fry's electronic, Best Buy, and the two from amazon. None of them worked. The range in prices vary from 18 to 2 dollars."
1,Dead on arrival,"I purchased this item for my shuffle to replace the one I lost. I figured it should be fine since its just a cable right? Apple wanted something like 20 bucks, which I felt was a rip off, so I bought this thing along with the wall charger for a couple bucks more. The thing is totally dead. It doesn't charge and I-Tunes doesn't even recognize a device no matter which usb port or computer I use. The wall charger works with my Nano though so it wasn't a total loss. I guess I'm going to have to bite the bullet and get the one from Apple."
3,Another versatile adapter,This item was also another choice I had to energize my iPod talk; fits into the back of my PC and other adapters just fine.
2,Make sure it fits you iPod!,"I got this cable as a replacement for an iPod shuffle, but it doesn't fit. The cable that arrived has a 2.5 mm diameter plug, my iPod shuffle has a 3.5 mm socket. Don't know if seller sent wrong cable or if there are different models of the Apple's 2nd Generation shuffle."
3,You get what you pay for,"this cord is perfect for a replacement if you have a desktop computer. however my friend has a laptop and he hates this because if you move the ipod around it disconnects and reconnects, which is a pain. but if you're like me and you broke your 1st cord and refuse to pay 30 dollars for a new one this is a decent replacement merely because it gets the job done"
1,Bad purchase,This is the 2nd one I oredred and that make 2 that have open leads in them. I metered them with a ohm meter and they have opens in them. I just want one that works.
2,Works halfway.,"I went this route because I liked the idea of not having an actual dock.As other reviews have stated, there is a wiring error here that creates an error message and shuts down one of my USB port (the one on the side of my MacBook that I primarily use). Out of curiosity, I plugged it into the port on the opposite side and it seems to work fine, and boots with iTunes after about a minute (so it's slower, but functional).So I guess it works on one of my two USB ports, but I wouldn't suggest it. Unless you really want to stay away from the dock-style adapters."
2,Nothing wrong with it except...,"I got this and the first thing I noticed is that the usb interface was bent, like if someone did it with pliers. I fixed it with a butter knife, but I didn't like the fact that I had to do this.."
5,Getting the job done.,This product really makes it easy to manage music. It's a small piece but takes care of huge projects. I had lost my original and needed a quick fix. I placed an order and in 3 days I was back on track.
1,all that anticipation for nothing,"so i waited the week for this item, i was so excited when it showed up, all pumped up to jam out. and it didnt work :( SOMEONE HELP ME!!!!?!"
2,ipod cord,"the shipment got to me on time, product was a dud..does not work..very disappointed in distributors product, stuck not being able to charge my ipod"
1,The cable does not work,I had lost my OEM cable and ordered two replacements - none of them worked. I guess you get what you pay :(
1,Still doesn't work,"Upon receiving this product, I plugged it in and realized it did not work. I tried everything I could think of / google could think of to fix it, and nothing helped. So when Amazon asked me for my review, I stated that the cord was faulty. I was surprised when the seller sent me another one to replace it, but disappointed and annoyed to find that the new one didn't work either. So now I have two of these things and still neither of them functions. Sorry guys, don't buy this product."
1,Does not work!,It did nothing when i plugged it into my ipod and computer. Does not Work. Do not waste your dollar. Buy a lottery ticket instead!
3,Order error not knowing about the different generations,I didn't know there was different generations of the iPod Shuffle. When I ordered the cord it looked like the on I had lost. When I received the cord and it was for the second generation not the fourth generation. Communication error it would cost more to get the right cord than mess with. My error.
1,Avoid! Trust me It will not work!,"Purchased this since I lost the original cable for my Ipod shuffle, I thought ""hey this is cheap why not!"" , but it was a waste of money, upon receiving it worked for a few minutes, right when i disconnected the cable, and reconnected again it stopped working no charge or anything so i thought It could of been the ipod, I went ahead and borrowed another cable from a friend, tested works great , so dont bother wasting your money on this! 'YOU WILL' be disappointed."
5,Good Good Good,This is much better the the one for the old 2nd gen ipod shuffle and much shorter and much cheaper.... this is the way to go.
1,Does not work for me,This product does not work with my iPod Shufflel I did receive it quickly in the mail and it was reasonably priced. I'm ok only being out a few bucks.
1,Dont Work At All,"this cable just dont work, dont buy. Better spend more on something that really work and dont on this item."
1,"Terrible product, does not work, do NOT buy!","I should have read the other reviews, I just wanted a cheap, simple power cord for my shuffle and found this. It didn't work at all, and after reading other reviews it doesn't look like it has worked for anyone else either."
1,Disappointing Cord,"I was really looking forward to using this cord to hook up a friend's ipod to the computer. Unfortunately, it did not work. I didn't bother with the hassle of returning it because it was so cheap."
5,Great money saver,"Can't beat this on price, bought this for my grandchildren and at first they didn't like it they thought it looked cheap... but after they got over the fact of it not being a brand name they use it all the time..."
5,This is the right cord!,"I have a refurb-iPod shuffle, and this is the Apple cord for it. I say this, because I ordered a different put identical looking cord from Amazon, and the plug was slightly larger. It fit in the iPod, but did not work when connected to the computer. So... Get this one!"
1,Bad Cable-,Although the price of the cable was excellent $1.58. The old saying you get what you pay for came through on this one. The USB end was slightly crooked and could not fit into any USB port.At $1.58 it would cost me more to return it than just throw it out. Sad and still looking for the correct cable.
1,Took a Chance...and Lost,"At $2.24, I figured I'd take a chance. After all, according to the reviews, it worked for at least some folks. Took the advice of one reviewer and bought from Eforcity to hopefully increase my chances. Ended up losing the gamble. Hope you have better luck."
1,Piece of crap dont bye,"this is a piece of crap. the title says it all. dont buy this. i bought it and i havent been able to listen to music for a month because i had to replace 2 now. when i dont listen to music it makes me upset, so DONT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME"
1,IT's a Fake!,I got this chord was shocked that it was so cheap but believed it...IT'S A TOTAL FLUKE! Does not work at all! I can't even believe that this is being sold on amazon! I would expect it on ebay but not amazon! It should be removed if at all possible.
1,did not work,this was meant to replace my lost ipod shuffle cable but it is not flat near where it fits into the computer. so it isn't flush and computer does not recognize my ipod. back to square one. don't buy this.
1,waste,Its not worth buying this product because its not working with my ipod.My money got wasted.So I recommend you to buy from different place.
1,cheap,didn't work on my ipod that's why is better to go to store to buy stuff because you can test if not work!!!!! jezer
3,You get what you pay for.,You get what you pay for. It's not very good quality it fits very loosely in my computer. And sometimes it's hard to get my iPod to charge. But overall it's a good product for the price if you want something nice I would recommend spending a little more money.
4,great,awesome and cheap. It really lived up to its expectations and I usually am one that is pretty hard on things
5,Worked,"Charged up my shuffle just as it was supposed to. Quality product for a great price. The wire is VERY short, but if you have a front USB port or laptop, it's not too much of a hassle."
1,This sucks,"Well, it sucks because it doesnt work. I just got mine today, and it simply doesnt work, the usb is crap. Im not totally bummed about it because i only spent 1.00 on this thing. Just thought id give upcoming buyers a heads up."
1,does not work with iPod shuffle 4g,"This review shouldn't really have any stars, good or bad; it's just to point out that this is a 2g shuffle cable (like it says in the name) and *does not work* for the newest 4g shuffles. A proper 4g plug is the tiniest bit different in length, and its contact areas are shifted. Maddening, but Apple's fault, not the product's."
1,Damn It.,"Does not work. And of course, why would it? I paid two bucks for the damn thing. damn damn damn damn damn."
1,replacement cord for ipod nano,cord did not work at all but the price was good!!! Cord did not cost enough to return.Very disapppointed that cord did not charge ipod. It fit the ipod but would not charge it.
1,Didn't work,I tried all of the usb ports on my netbook but couldn't get my shuffle to start a charge. What should I expect for $0.54? Bummer
1,Didn't work.,Doesn't work.Ended up finding my original a week or so after I bought this one.Shuffle charges and connects to computer with the original cable but does not with this cable.
1,Won't work and a waste!,This product didn't even work. I thought for the price it was a dream come true but its a useless peice of plastic. The return shipping and hassling isn't worth attempting to get less the 2 dollars of this crap back. I hope it works for you other fine folks looking for a deal but I don't think your gonna find it here.
1,Does not WORK,"JUST DOES NOT WORK, DO NOT BUY THIS THING.PD: I put one start because otherwise Amazon does not allow me to write my review, but actually this product does not deserve any."
1,DO NOT BUY. The cord doesn't work at all.,"Just go ahead and splurge on the $4.99 iPod Shuffle cord. I got this one in yesterday and tried it with my new shuffle, on three different computers, and it simply doesn't work. For all i know it's just a prop. Don't waste the $2.00 like I did."
4,Good Product,"Works perfectly, I lost my other shuffle charger and it was driving me crazy. I got this thing and just plugged it in, and it worked."
1,Doesn't work,I patiently waited for the delivery of the original product and the replacement product but both items were defective and did not work. The seller was responsive and cooperative but the process was a complete waste of my time.
1,Does not sync with computer!,This product only charges ipod shuffles. It does not allow you to sync your ipod from your computer
1,Doesn't work,"bought two of them. neither work. not worth the time or effort to return at this price, but you are flushing your money down the toilet if you buy this."
3,MIght only good for charging...,"My niece lost the original cable when she borrowed my ipod shuffle G2 for a trip. I'm not sure if it's the particular piece I received, or this item is generally like this from this seller. I only can use it to charge my ipod shuffle. When I plug it to my PC, iTune does not identify my ipod at all, no matter how I try it. I wonder if I really should pay that $29 to buy the replacement cable from Apple."
1,doesn't work,"I bought this to replace a missing charging cord for my ipod shuffle, however when I plugged it into my computer and connected it to the shuffle, it did not charge. I'm not sure what purpose it is supposed to serve, but I had to go to the Apple store to purchase a new one."
1,Doesn't work with iTunes music that resides on a USB drive,"I'm sure the product works fine in most situations. My iTunes music resides on an external USB drive. Whenever I plug this in, it makes my USB drive literally go away, it drops out of site. Powering my drive off/on a couple times gets it back. I thought it was something else, but I've been able to re-create the problem a couple times and I am sure its caused by my iPod using this cable."
1,NOT COMPATABLE,this did not work with either of my ipod shuffles. boooooooo. i was very disappointed. very very very very bad.
1,Did not work,"Was cheap and did not work. Therefore, I got what I paid for. Next time I will go to the apple store directly if for some reason my usb charger does not work on my I pod shuffle."
1,It Didn't work!,"The darn thing didn't even work. I plugged it in to my computer, as I would w/ my other usb/charger, and my ipod did not charge!!"
1,Wired incorrectly,"Wired incorrectly, I used an ohm meter to check the wiring on an Apple 2nd gen shuffle charger and the metal case that goes into the usb port (of the computer)is connected to the 3rd segment from the top of the 1/8"" plug, this would be chasis ground. These low price connectors do not connect the metal case of the usb port to the chasis ground which leads to the error message that the unit conected to the usb port is drawing to much current and the usb ports is shutting down. Thus this unit does not work for charging or transfering data. If I can figure out the wiring so easily with an ohm meter, why can't the chinese or whoever makes these? I don't know how some of these units reviewed work unless they make some that do connect to chasis ground. Price was cheap enough so nothing really lost. My shuffle was not damaged by this cord."
1,Didn't work,didn't work at all. Get the little cordless one instead (White - iPod Shuffle 2nd Generation USB Charger Adapter); that worked.
1,DO NOT BUY! FRIED IPOD SHUFFLE!!!!!,This item seemed like a bargain but it was a big mistake!Using it totally turned our new iPod Shuffle to waste.Sorry we ever considered it! How they could make something so simple to be so bad that is destroys your electronics is hard to understand... but unfortunately true.
1,Seriously!!!,I spent the money albeit small amount and shipping to get this charger. Got my hopes up to have a running Shuffle again and was slapped in the face with a failed product. I've read the reviews and yes the average price was around $1 and isn't worth enough to return or squak at but get this. Hundreds of people purchase this product and others like it and don't bother to get their money back and guess what folks. Cents on the dollar or $1.08 per person adds up and were just letting this schmuck get paid from out laziness.I WANT MY BUCK O FIVE BACK!
2,Do not try for a 4th Generation Shuffle,"My husband lost his ipod shuffle charger and I saw this on Amazon and, with shipping, it was only $1.06 so I figured, why not? I don't know if it didn't work because is advertised for the 2nd generation and I tried to use it for the 4th generation, but they both plug into the earphone portal so I thought it should work. If I talk really nice to it I can get it to sync with itunes, but if you leave it plugged into the computer it sucks the battery dead instead of charging it. Like I said, I don't know if this is because I used it on a 4th generation model, but after reading other reviews I suspect it may just be junk. Fortunately, I'm only out a buck, but don't waste your money on this one if you have a 4th generation ipod Shuffle."
1,Piece of junk!!,"My computer doesn't even register this thing when it's plugged into the USB drive. I instead plugged it into a USB wall adapter and still nothing. Yeah, it was $1.77, but I would be willing to pay more for something that actually charged my ipod. What a piece of crap."
1,Doesn't Work on my 4th Generation Shuffle!,"I now have a useless USB connector. I guess I should have read the reviews before buying this, not worth the time trying to return it."
1,Mine doesn't work.,"I bought 2 of these, didn't need to use them until after the return period ended. I admit I seem to have lost one of them, but the one I still have does not work. Tried it on 3 different computers. They are cheap so it may have cost more to return it than what it was worth, anyway. Maybe my other one works, but I can't find it. Will add a comment or change this review if I find the lost one."
1,piece of crap,this is a cheap product does not workdoes not charge my ipod at alldoes not work need i explain more
1,Should have spent my dollar on a lotto ticket instead,**Please read other reviews** This cord does not work. Period. I would have had a better chance with investing my dollar in a lotto ticket than wasting it on this cable. The amount of money involved isn't worth the trouble of getting a resolution. And I have a sneaky feeling that is exactly what the sellers are hoping.
1,It doesn't work at all!!!,The cable should charge my ipod and should also be the usb data connection! NOTHING!!! Both function don't work!You could think it must be the device but it worked with an other cable.
1,Don't buy,"This adaptor burned out my ipod, burned my carpeting and is dangerous due to it being faulty. When I contacted the seller they give you the run around and can't even tell you who the manufacturer is. No one is held responsible and hopefully no ones house burns down if they plug this in and go."
1,Not worth even a penny!!!,"I ordered this because my friend lost my docking station to my ipod shuffle. I needed something to recharge and load my shuffle without having to buy another. Well I got it in the mail today and tried to plug it in and noticed a few things.The material used in making this is such low quality, it doesn't even feel like it meets the requirements for electronic devices. The plastic feels well frankly, cheap.The cord is maybe 3 inches long and when you plug it in it doesn't work. No lights no connection and my computers (and I do have 4 different computers I tried it on to see if it was just the computer) did not even notice there was something plugged into the USB drive. This is a waste of money and I suggest just paying more money to get something that works the first time."
1,DANGEROUS!,Use this item at your own risk! It caused a power surge in my computer that damaged the ipod shuffle as well as my computer. Not worth the risk!
3,Does not work on Generation 4 but may work on Gen 2,"Do not try to use for Gen 4 IPOD Shuffle, this cable is for Gen 2 only and is either too long or wired incorrectly for Generation 4"
1,did not work,did not work with my ipod. had to go to best buy and spend $20.00 for one.will not try cheap parts again.
1,Did not work at all.,I dislike this product because it did not work on my iPod Shuffle. I attempted multiple variations of troubleshooting and never got a single step further than plugging it in.
3,It will do.,The product works fine but you have to fiddle with it to get it to make an actual full connection.
1,Horrible Product,I bought this because it was really cheap but when I received this it did not work I don't recommend this charger at all
2,Wont sync with computer but will charge,Would charge the Ipod but couldn't get it to sync to computer. It didn't fit tight either. Definatly would not recomend. Didn't do what I thought it should.
1,POS - Avoid,"Well it didn't work, so I'd say thats a pretty big problem.What a POS.Avoid, buy something else or nothing, you'll get the same result."
1,Deserves ZERO stars - did NOT work,"Wish I had listened to the other reviewers, but the cost of the cord was so much cheaper than the Apple product that I thought I would roll the dice. Suffice to say, the cord DOES NOT WORK!!! Steer clear!"
1,Not even the same size in real life.,"I got sent this and I practically got send an iPod death wish. After a few weeks, my iPod inherited this fuzzy noise AFTER the first initial charge with this charger. Then the charger broke on it's own for some reason. Now my iPod only makes the fuzzy noise and I believe this seller is to blame. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
1,Just a waste of time (money too),I don't care if I paid $100 bucks or just a couple dollars. I didn't get my order and I'm wasting my time writting a complain and a review. If I were you stay away from this seller.
2,navigating the social world,This book is for a teacher or the like to use to design a curicullum for a child with aspergers it is not a curiculum
3,More technical than parents might want,"I am a parent of a child with social skills difficulties akin to Aspergers. I ordered three books at the same time including this one. I found this the least approachable and chose to return it-- something I rarely do. You'd have to really sit down and dig into this book to get anything practical out of it for your child. The information is here, but it's not layed out well visually or in casual vocabulary.Instead I was most impressed with and plan to start using Social Skills Training by Jed Baker. I also found useful Good Friends are Hard to Find by Frankel."
4,Up and down,"Shaoran's party arrives in some strange worlds this time. They find themselves stuck in a book that is being written by Mokona. As you can imagine, this place is very strange, but not very dangerous. After leaving there, they are stuck on a bus traveling across the desert. At night, the bus stops and the travelers are attacked. After escaping the attackers, Shaoran's group arrives at a library where he learns the truth about Kurogane's past."
2,Not Appropriate for all 9 year olds,"My third grader and I read this together as it was on the school's recommended reading list. I did not feel she was ready to read this book given her current level of maturity. The two children in the book are currently living with their father and his live-in girl friend while their parents undergo a divorce that is not yet finalized. At one point the 6 year old in the story is very confused and upset as he overheard the live-in girl friend talking about her positive pregnancy test. The book also deals with gangs and some street violence. As my third grader read this aloud to me, she had several questions that lead to topics of discussion that I would have like to have held off on for another year or so. I saw this as the beginning of desensitizing my child to moral and ethical delimas of the world we now live-in...if they see it or read it enough it becomes common life and no longer has shock value."
4,Hidden Kung Fu Gem,I admit This movie was much better than I ever expected. This movie would have gotten a 5 if it weren't for the ending. This storyline is the classic Murder/Revenge-Student/Teacher plot you get in most Kung fu flix. But the training sequences rival that ofthe Master Killer. The young student must past the 18 tests in order to get a Famous Fighting styles book. Its not too fake though because he gets his butt whipped plenty of times. So bad you start to feel sorry for the guy. The fight scene with the 80 year old monk who looks like a kid is worth the whole movie. I recommend this as Classic Kung fu. Oh Yeah the villian is Mark Long(Ghost-face killer).
3,"to small,","The ring ran small. I tried getting a hold of the people who I ordered it from, and they never returned my email."
1,bad company,i ordered my mermaid ring for my birthday in July and its now october and no ring. they sent to the address i provided and couldn't find it. all of my other orders have gotten here just fine for the past 6 years.i have repeatedly emailed and even found a phone number online and left voice mails....no response. i think they just want your money to send you crappy silver that you might get.. you might not.
4,El Divo Christmas Album,"This was the most beautiful CD I have heard in a long time. The voice blending of these gentlemen is amazing and such a pleasure to listen to. I was a bit surprised to hear the song ""Over the Rainbow"" included in the selections. It really didn't seem appropriate, but maybe I am missing something. I really loved the CD, except for that song."
5,Christmas Collection,The Il Divo christmas collection is amazing. Their voices make the christmas songs sound even better.
3,trashed,Don t know if they are rejects or not but really easy to get them scratched and I do not touch the fronts.Music really good!
3,A little disappointed,"It wasn't the performance I'd seen on PBS, which was what I was looking for. One of the singers on the CD is no longer with the group and that does make a difference in the production. That's all. We'll still listen to it."
5,CD,This is one of the prettiest Christmas CD's you will ever find. I love every song on it which is unusual.
3,Not into hype,"While the majority of selections were paletable, the recording engineer must have been asleep for O Holy Night.I believe the mixing of background symphony could have been better-too one dimensional.The chorus was disjointed and seemed out of place. The timing of the different singers out of sync and with varing volumes.Looking for a Christmas CD-Michael Crawford's A Christmas Album!"
1,Not for Classical Vocal Music fans,"If you enjoy classical vocal music, skip this. I have never heard this group before and I don't know their names or voices. The auspicious aspects are that when singing full voice they produce some nice, pleasant and sometimes even stirring, albeit conventional, harmonies and there is one voice that is clearly more polished, sounding baritonal and full and strong and not requiring a close mike as do the others. The unfortunate aspects are the vocal arrangements are all too similar and the second tenor begins most songs as a solo with a very weak, completely unsupported, monotonous, unattractive, soft, insipid, breathy, crooning, microphone-hugging approach that I find so bad it spoils those songs for me and I cannot listen to them or must fast forward through his solos. When the first tenor adds a solo it is woefully thin but with purer tone and so more acceptable."
5,Delightful harmonies with these talented men,Il Divo never fails to delight my listening ears. I love their blend of voices and choices of music.
5,IlDivo,I first heard this foursome sing Amazing Grace (The Promise) and fell in love with their music. Awesome CD to listen to in the car.
5,Love it.,The Christmas Collection by Il Divo is absolutely beautiful. I LOVE it. Hope there is a DVD of this so I can be absolutely sure who is singing what. What a great addition to my collection of music while driving.
5,The most beautiful Christmas album I've heard,"I have always loved Christmas music, but this is the best I've heard. Adding the sacred songs to the traditional Christmas songs makes the album relect the season in such a meaningful way. The richness of the Il Divo voices gives these songs a depth that touches my heart and soul."
2,Little Disclosure Needed,"Without a doubt these gifted men are a pleasure to witness. My disappointment is most of the songs are in Italian and as an English speaking person, a lot was lost not being able to understand the lyrics of the song. The CD cover should have been a little more forthcoming in describing the content. But again, this group could be the best male vocal group we have seen in many, many years."
3,vocal perfection with mediciore sound mixing,"THESE GENTLEMEN DESERVED BETTER SOUND ENGINEERING ON THIS ALBUM. ONE OF THE WONDERFUL UNIQUE QUALITIES OF THIS QUARTET IS THE SEQUENCING AND BLENDING OF THEIR VOICES. EVEN THEIR VIBRATTOS ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL! THERE SEEMED TO BE OVERPRESENCE OF ACCOMPANYING ORCHESTRAL AND CHORAL WORKS ON MANY OF THE PIECES.THEIR BEAUTY WAS SIMPLY DROWNED OUT.AS FAR AS CHRISTMAS MUSIC IS CONCERNED, I MUCH PREFERRED JOSH GROBIN'S ""NOEL"" ALBUM, ALTHOUGH I HAVE LOVED OTHER IL DIVO RECORDINGS."
5,Great Christmas Music,"This is the best Christmas album I have purchased in the past five years.I have given this album to every friend I feel did not have it, as partof a Christmas present or just because I knew they would enjoy it."
3,I was expecting more...,"Although I like Il Divo, I was expecting more from this album. It is a good buy if you REALLY like them."
1,Not up to their standards,"Very disappointed in this cd, choice of music isn't good, voices no where near as vibrant. Orchestra is not good. very, very disappointed."
2,Not quite right!!!!,I have their first and second album which were great. But for this album is not great as the other two. I think the record company really make a mistake to released this album. Not bad but these song were not for IL DIVO.
4,Great music for Christmas,"I enjoyed this very much, though a song or two, I am not sure how it becomes Christmas. Lovely voices."
5,From the UK.....,"Great album, I agree with all the other reviews but I must point out that Over the Rainbow is certainly not considered a Christmas song here in the UK. I have no idea why they have included it. Then again I also have no idea why My Favourite Things features on a number of other Christmas albums."
5,cd collection,This is a must have cd for your Christmas collection. These voices blend like a fine-tuned machine. Order was shipped immediately. A must-have.
2,So so CD,"I've been a big fan of IL DIVO, but this CD wasn't great. It's too formal for Xmas and too standard for BGM, and too ordinary as a CD."
5,Very enjoyable,"I've listened to this CD many, many times this holiday season and would highly recommend everyone add it to their holiday CD collection."
1,Over-Produced,"This CD is an example of what's wrong with the music industry today. Put a handful is unbelievable good looking young men (or women) on an album cover, toss in a name of an important-sounding discoverer (Simon Cowell, Oprah, David Foster, etc.) and whamo! Instant hit.The vocals on this CD are so overdone and forced it hurts the ears. Il Divo must be laughing all the way to the bank. This one is a DUD."
2,Oversung,"Let me begin by saying I am no music expert. This album is not worth the money, even discounted. These guys need 2 or 3 years more experience in singing together so they can gain a bit more control over their combined voices trying to sing as strong as they can - too strong. This CD would have been much better had they recorded it at a live concert. And, who ever heard of ""Over the Rainbow"" on a Christmas album, then the shouted Ave Maria, give me a break. Yes, their singular voices are beautiful, but its like I have to hold my breath while they are . . . singing? . . . shouting, then at times the music is dragging as in ""A Child Is Born"". Someone lost control -- too slow -- to much trying to be too great! I guess you can say I am disappointed with this CD and am sending it back."
1,Big disappointment,I too am sorry I wasted my money on this CD. The measly ten songs were uninspiring and overproduced. There are much better Christmas albums available. Don't buy this one.
2,This better be better than Ancora,"Whatever you do DO NOT buy the new Il Divo CD titled Ancora. I ordered it through Amazon UK, being such a fan of the first recording, but, OHHH, was I wrong! It is over produced, over orchestrated and overpowers, rather than showcases, the group's voices. The first CD was fabulous, but the second is a resounding dissapointment. Let's hope the Christmas CD is better (and who exactly calls Over the Rainbow a Christmas song??)"
2,The Requisite Christmas Album,The guys have nice voices and the ladies will love their squeaky good looks. But don't take them seriously. They are a money machine.
3,Average Il Divo,"After everything else I've heard and seen from this group, I was a little bit disappointed with this CD. It's not great, but it's not horrible either. Hey, it's still Il Divo!"
3,Good group,"Like I said before, no matter how you shake it up ""I really like the tight harmony that sometimes lacks with these guys. Sometimes it sounds like they are trying to out sing each other""."
5,A Spiritual Experience,"This one won't be tucked away. These spiritual, inspring voices need to be heard year round."
3,mmm more or less.,Not as I expect. I bought the cd mainly for the song Silent Night but frankly I've heard better versions.
2,"Good collection, but where's the joy?","This has some interesting renditions, but this doesn't feel very Christmas-y to me. I like Il Divo a lot, I think they have great voices. But this is very lackluster to me- I can't feel any Christmas spirit in this album. There's more Religious general songs than Christmas songs here. Short arse review, I know, but there isn't really a whole lot to say about this. Overall, interesting, but hardly any Christmas spirit."
2,Not Acceptable,"Il Divo -- the Christmas Collection was a disappointment to me. Frankly, several of the songs sounded like the guys just got together without even rehearsing and said, ""Let's sing Christmas songs!"" I expected more of this group so I was disappointed. In my opinion, this CD was just thrown together so the Il Divo could have a Christmas CD and the producers may have hoped that people wouldn't notice. Well, this person did notice. I really don't recommend buying this CD."
4,My wife and I really like all tenors,This album was a part of my collection in my car so we can enjoy them all during the Christmas season.we enjoyed it very much.
4,"Good, but not good enough","This was very nice, but too many contemporary songs, not nearly enough classic."
2,Disappointing,"While all 4 gentlemen in Il Divo have wonderful voices, it seems as though they are competing in every song to show which of them has the best voice. Instead of using vibratto to color and add depth to their interpretation of the songs, they over use it. They need to work as a group, rather than as inividual singers vying for notarity."
3,Good for classical Christmas,This cd is great when you are in the mood for a heavier Christmas spirit of music. Sometimes I want to slip out of light or humorous Christmas music and get carried away by the reason for the season.
1,High School Christmas Concert,"Thank you for bringing me back to St Catherine High School's Christmas Concert in 1968. I was hoping for the occasional acoustical auditorium cough, but I guess I'll survive. Thanks again!"
1,Been had.,"Trite schlock. Pablum. Pretentious fluff. Dirge-like renditions of lovely songs like ""White Christmas;"" the inappropriate inclusion of ""Over the Rainbow."" Skip this if you have any taste in music at all. Try Kiri Te Kanawa's great Christmas disc if you don't yet have it."
1,Not a good seller!,I have contacted this seller twice since ordering with no reply. The CD didn't come so I guess I can't review it. I can however review the seller: poor. This has never happened to me thru Amazon so guess how I'm feeling???
3,Better Looking than The Monkees,"Seems like everyone and his mother has a Christmas album. For all of you who have written that Il Divo is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and their X-Mas DVD is the best ever, I've got news for you. The best Christmas album was made about 40 years ago. It was voiceless and took 20 men to make the music. It was the Stan Kenton band's Christmas album with mellophoniums added(the mellophoniums contributed a sound like the beautiful French Horn). ""O Tannenbaum"" still sends shivers down my spine. ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" swings like crazy. ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" is an incredibly inventive arrangement, worthy of Maurice Ravel. For those of you who are so inclined, try to get a hold of this album (maybe it has been released on CD). It will be well worth the effort. For those of you who consider Il Divo the ultimate in musical expression ... well, that's what makes horseracing."
1,"cap broken in 2 months, impossible to clean, plastic smell",I purchased this teapot by reading/watching reviews in web .. I thought I can make green Tea very easily but I am totally wrong.Its impossible to clean once we made tea.There are high chances that cap will broken in first few weeks.. The cap is poorly designed and doesn't last long.
1,Too Pricey,"we own restaurants and i used to buy them in bulks, now they jacked up the price. What happened to $15? anyway World market sells very similar teapots for $15"
3,Functional But Stained Easily and Not BPA-Free,"Functional, practical, very easy to use. However, since I use it to make tea everyday, the teapot went from being transparent to cloudy really fast. The cloudiness comes from the tea stain that cannot be washed away. In less than a month, the teapot looks old and cloudy... Also, I am a bit concerned that it is not BPA free. Considering that I always pour boiling hot water into it to make tea, I wonder about its health impact (if any)."
3,"""Adagio"" teapot","I ordered the Adagio Teas 16-ounce Ingenuitea Teapot from Teasnetwork a few days ago and just got it today. It works exactly as it should, no leaking or anything of that nature. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I ordered the ADAGIO TEAS teapot, I got the La Mode Tea/coffee maker. While it's the same thing I was hoping for Adagios teapot."
1,Poor customer service. Dishonest vendor. Would not buy fron again.,Very dishonest vendor. Received damaged package. Had to throw away most contents because they were damaged from packaging. Refused to rectify. Wasted $50.
4,Clever Little Teapot,This teapot was purchased to replace a similar unit that lasted at least 3 years. We would make 3-4 pots/day for more than 300 days/year. The failure of the first was a crack in the lid that make it difficult to keep the lid on; it still made tea.The plastic's heat conductivity is low enuf that there is little cooling during a 4 min. steeping. My trick with most teas is to fill it 1/3 full of hot water then drain quickly to clean the leaves and reduce the bitterness [my daughter likes the strong bitter part]. I can get about 3 pots of tea by using 2 rounded teaspoons of tea and increasing the steeping a bit for each pot.This unit is entirely of plastic with a removable filter that my wife cleans with a toothbrush occasionally. It is fine enuf that none of the finely-ground PGTips comes thru. It seems to be sturdier than the previous unit. It's a 4 1/2 star job which would have gotten 5 stars if it were a bit easier to clean.
3,Tas-TEA!,"I bought the 16 ounce version for myself, and after enjoying it so much, I bought the 32 ounce version for my boyfriend.The 32oz version is more apt to leak, which is why I voted this 3 stars. They even include a base for it to catch the leaks, which is why I imagine they know this issue, and this is their best fix for it.They say it's microwaveable, but I don't really believe in sticking plastic in the microwave, so I've never microwaved it. The filter looks to be a plastic mesh as opposed to the metal one on the smaller 16 oz one.Overall, I really enjoy this product and I'm actually about to make me some tea using it right now!"
5,Best Loose Tea Dispenser,I've owned the Adagio Ingenuitea Teapot for a year and find this the best teapot - no mess and no tea leaves in your cup. Great product that makes a great gift.
2,Great idea with one major flaw...,"For the first few months that I had this teapot it worked great. It was very convenient and easy to clean. Unfortunately, after a few cleanings, the filter must have shrunk a bit because it is too loose now. Whenever I put water in it, the filter just pops up making the teapot pretty useless."
5,LOVE.THIS.THING.,I've been wanting one of these for a few months. I finally ordered one and now I'm officially in love with an inanimate object.
3,Desktop Teapot Not Tea Cup As Shown,"Product as described. I use it every day. It's fun and simple to make fresh tea at your desk. Only hassle is when it comes to cleaning. Not an issue with tea bags. If intended for use in your office, be sure you have a sink for rinsing and a lined trash can for the soggy tea leaves. The lid tends to pop off easily too, but I'm not sure if that was intended part of the design. (NOTE: Picture shows teapot containing tea, but no tea leaves. So it's not a realistic picture of the product in use. In fact it would be impossible to use the way shown. You cannot drink the tea directly out of this product. You must let it drain through the filter at the bottom into a seperate cup.) Don't forget to order tea with it, as loose leaf tea is not so easy to find. Also, ideally it should come with a measuring spoon for the tea. Overall though, I am very happy with my purchase and the price I paid."
3,It does make my jasmine green tea smell weird.,"Everything is great except that it causes a weird smell, metal rusty like smell. I rinse it many time with hot water, but it doesn't seem to fix the problem.Except the smell problem, it works great. It is easy to use, convenient for steeping the second or third time."
2,filter screen lifts up when the hot water is added,"I love the concept but am disappointed every time I use it because unless you hold the filter screen down with your finger while adding the hot water, it will lift up, your loose tea will get underneath and clog up the process of the liquid draining and loose tea will get into your cup. I have stopped using it because I have to dump the hot water with the tea into something else to strain it. My Mom has one of these tea steepers made by Teavana, and I should have ordered one like hers but I bought this one because it was cheaper. Big mistake! PAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE YOU WILL BE FAR AHEAD IN THE LONG RUN!"
5,Adagio Ingenuitea Teapot,I ordered this for my husband and he loves it! It works so well I have ordered the 32oz. one so we can make pitchers of ice tea with it. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
5,tea time,"Amazing for winter especially which is the time for cold and flu when you do some herbal tea to avoid leaves and remainings this is a perfect ergonomic product, I bought for my mom also instead of my house."
4,Adagio Ingenuitea Teapot,"This product enables me to have fresh brewed tea from loose leaves with no hassle. It is easy and quick to brew a fresh cup of hot tea. However, I am uncertain whether the strainer is metal or a fabric mesh. There is no indication whether this tea steeper is safe to heat in the microwave or not."
5,Love it!,This is my second purchase. I love it because it is very easy to use and clean. It looks pretty too. I bought one for my father and he has been using to make coffee. I am considering to buy one more for myself.
4,Nice Teapot. Works Great.,"I would love to give this teapot a 5 star but unfortunately I can't. I ordered two of these about 2 weeks apart. The first one ordered came with just the tea pot but the second one came with a nice plastic plate to keep it from dripping on counters, etc. When I contacted the company because the first one was missing the plate they promptly told me that they no longer sold the pots with the plates, yet I got the plate with the second one I ordered. It was disappointing to know that I probably did not get the whole set.Other then the problem with the company, the tea pot works fine and haven't had any problems."
3,Ingenuitea teapot gets most out of loose tea,"Heat water in microwave or on stove and dump over loose leaf tea in the Ingenuitea Teapot. Keep water below boil point or tea may be ""flat"" tasting. (I was told the oxygen can get boiled out.) I set the microwave timer for four minutes steeping time.Sometimes the internal strainer pops out when the hot water is poured in. If strainer lifts off bottom, use a separate hand strainer over cup to filter loose tea. Easy to clean.I can't go back to tea bags ever again. From a Chinese store you can get 1800 cupsof tea from one $9.00 15 oz. canister."
3,Very handy but a little quirk.,Teapot is cool but the strainer is hard to keep in the bottom. Tea grounds will get under the strainer and it will leak out. Make sure your cup will hold the water in the teapot and have it ready!
4,This product is awesome!,"I received one of these for a birthday present and have used it every day since! For those who have never experienced the flavor of loose leaf teas, you don't know what you're missing! The only problem I have is making that second cup of tea by reusing the same tea leaves. The leaves have a tendency to get stuck in the valve on the bottom and I occasionally have come back to dispense my tea into a cup and have found my tea all over my countertop! I have found that as long as I don't reuse the tea leaves, this product is perfect!!"
5,Ingenuitea Teapot,"Great for tea lovers. Steeps the tea perfectly,while keeping the beverage hot. Also very easy to clean. Nothing left to say about this product folks."
3,cheaper than similar teavana product,seems to work ok; make separating tea or tea bags from tea a much less messy process; I've used it with bags & loose tea.
3,Filter comes loose,"As many people have stated the filter on this thing often comes loose in the middle of brewing. But I still liked it so I instead bought the SMART TEA MAKER which is exactly the same as this tea maker except the filter doesn't come loose. The Smart Tea Maker also has a more attractive design, comes with a coaster and also the lid is detachable which makes it more convenient. This is a great item, but I'd recommend The Smart just because of what I stated above- I think they sell it here on Amazon too, but I got mine from an online specialty tea store.Does anyone know if these types of tea brewers can also be used for coffee? If so is it best to have one for coffee and one for tea or is it safe to brew both in the same one?"
5,Best tea maker ever!,"I bought my IngenuiTEA back in 2006 and I've used it daily since then. It gives the tea leaves room to expand, it's easy to clean and it's long lasting. I've changed filters once during this period of five years, but that was purely due to esthetic reasons - The filter I had was miscolored, as is expected when one drinks a lot of black tea, but it was working perfectly well. Actually, I soaked it in vinegar after having ordered a new filter and it turned out almost as good as new, but since I had a new one I just changed to that one. If you are still in doubt about whether to buy this, check out the video that demonstrates how to use it."
1,IT LEAKS,"I got this as a present for mom, an avid tea drinker, because it was featured/endorsed by America's Test Kitchen. She opened it, filled it with water and water immediately started dripping out the bottom.There are two rubbery gaskets which should seal together on the movable base. We took it apart and inspected it. There were no visible defects or damage to any of the parts. After putting it back together, it still leaks. I have absolutely no idea what the tea tastes like since we never got that far in the process.There is a possibility that I just got the one defective model off the assembly line, but since there were no obvious problems with the seals I would sooner think it is a design flaw."
3,Used at a Restaurant,So I don't actually own this but it is used for tea at a restaurant I go to fairly often for breakfast/brunch. Its certainly makes the art of brewing and drinking tea a little more theatrical which I would argue isn't a bad thing my only issue with it is that its made of plastic and I just don't know if I trust that whatever type of plastic this item is currently made of is safe (especially when constantly in contact with boiling water). Anyways if you aren't worried about the possible plastic thing you should totally buy this because its really neat and all your guests will be in au of this simple device.
5,Ingenious,"The easiest, neatest way to brew loose leaf. Your tea leaves are allowed to stretch out and relax -- no teapot insert gives as much room. All the best of brewing properly in a pot and then straining over the cup, but none of the mess. Plus, the kids love to see it dispense into the mug. I want to give one to everyone."
1,Not 32 oz.!,"I bought the 32 oz. teapot. I haven't even used it yet because I was struck by its small size. I used a measuring cup to fill it up, and I got to about 28 oz, and that's filling it up dangerously high. I sent an email to the company asking where the other 4 oz went. I'll update if I hear a response. Someone else had a similar review so I know I'm not the only one, and its not my math!"
2,Flawed design,"This product is dishwasher safe, but the top cannot be removed or folded back to easily place it in the rack. The top also makes cleaning by hand a problem, at least for someone with large hands like me.Brewing, like a tea ball better.Storage, takes up a lot more space than a tea ball.Cleaning, it is a lot more difficult to remove the leaves from this product versus a tea ball.Did not come with instructions on how to replace the filter or how or where to order filters when needed.All in all I am not impressed with this product, in my opinion I wasted my money."
5,What a thing!,"Look I'll be honest I don't like tea and I don't drink tea (on account of the horrendous flavor), but I sure do love this teapot. Make any kind of drink and put it in there and serve it in the coolest way possible. Also great if you have some crazy person in your house that likes pulp in their orange juice (WTF, right?!). Now you don't need to buy separate orange juice you can just strain out that nasty pulp with this!!"
2,Meh...,"I have been using an Ingenuitea Teapot for a couple months.The Good:- Easily makes a fine cup of tea.- Lid keeps tea hot during steeping.The Bad:- The attached lid makes it difficult to empty the brewed tea out, clean the cup, and dry. Also, it won't easily fit in the dishwasher or drainer.- Tea leaves get caught in handle and hinge.- It's made out of plastic--yes, BPA-free plastic but plastic nonetheless.- Doesn't fit larger mugs. Work-around is to hold it over the mug and press the bottom of the Ingenuitea with the end of a spoon.- Not sure how this is any better than my ceramic infuser cup that cost $10 and has none of the above issues."
5,Adagio Teas Ingenuitea 16 oz Teapot,"Love this tea steeper so much I ordered a second one. We use loose leaf tea quite a bit and this works great. Put it over a mug for hot tea, or over a glass full of ice for iced tea. Others have said the strainer floats up....so far we haven't had that problem. We don't microwave it; we simply add boiling water and steep for desired strength. It sits on a tile counter without leaking. The lid comes off (be gentle with the tips that snap into cup) which makes It so easy to clean out. I have put it in the dishwasher's top rack, from time to time, with no problem. I would recommend this tea steeper without hesitation."
5,She LOVES it!,"I purchased this teapot for the better half after we picked up some loose leaf gunpowder tea from the local asian market.I really like the innovative design compared to the tea ""balls"". Most reviews I read on the various ""balls"" said they didn't close properly so you'd end up with tea leaves in your tea. The design of this teapot makes it nearly impossible to end up with leaves in your tea.The girlfriend says it's ""stupid simple"". :)I'm considering getting the 32oz version for around the houseNo complaints so far! Will update if we manage to find something we don't like about this teapot"
4,"Great and easy to use, but doesn't fit all cups","Only took off one star because it says it fits ALL cups but it doesn't fit one of mine that isn't obscenely large or anything, which sucks. Otherwise its awesome and easy to use. I wish you could detach ANY of it to clean it, but you can't which sucks if you're using loose leaves."
5,LOVE,"I love it! It's so clever. Just got it today, and so far it works great! Having a nice cup of tea right now. Like a doofus I ordered the 16 oz. I will be ordering the larger size version in the near future for when I have company. I would highly recommend this item."
4,The only drawback is the plastic,"This is a nifty little tea gadget. I've had mine for about a year and a half. I love how easy it makes brewing loose leaf tea. No bitterness, and it allows the leaves to completely unfurl unlike most teapots with built in strainers. The only thing I don't like is that it is plastic. Over time, mine has stained and just won't come clean. I'm loathe to really scrub it or put chemicals on it because plastic scratches and will hold chemicals and bacteria in the scratches. (Just ask anyone who brews beer, that a plastic brew vat only works for a few batches). I clean mine only with boiling water and a sponge or paper towels. If this were glass, it would probably be perfect. But at 16 bucks, I suppose I can afford to recycle my old one and buy a new one every couple of years."
4,Get the 32oz one,"Nice product, no need to get the special mug, it should fit on most any drinking cup/mug. I was surprised how small the 32oz model was, really happy i didn't go with the 16oz!"
4,Great idea for making looseleaf tea,"I don't know who came up with this product, but it is a great idea. Works perfectly. The only problem I've run into was that one time the small filter came loose and floated up to the top. Since then I've made sure it is well seated. Product is well worth the money. Eliminates the need for a small teapot and filters. Allows the tea to float freely and release all its goodness."
3,Nice container but plastic is a no no,"Do not drink tea from any plastic container.Glass, ceramic, cast iron, stainless steel, stone/clay or porcelain only.Glass is by far the best and seems to leech the least into the taste of the tea. Ceramic and stainless steel is good for on the go, but the metal to-go containers tend to alter the taste of the tea. Cast iron teaware such as a tetsubin is nice, but needs you to take care of it regularly.Adagio does have glass teaware available that is very good. Also check out Samovar Tea shop in San Francisco or their website at SamovarLife dot com. Samovar has outstanding teaware for on the go and at home."
2,Arrived late,"It's a great product and I am happy with it. It arrived very late and tried to contact them repeatedly, to no avail. I will not buy anything from them again."
1,Worst pruct ever,"It came with defect and there were no ways to fix it, unfortunately i through out the box before trying it so i couldn't return it. I don't recommend this product."
1,Poor service from Nutricity,"I never received the teapots. Nutricity sent me tomatoe sauce, I returned the tomatoe sauce and Nutricity never made the effort to send the correct item. If Nutricity is involved I will not purchase another thing."
5,a perfect cup of tea (or coffee in a pinch),"I love this little gadget for brewing tea *or* coffee - in three years of using it I've never had any problems with the filter floating up and it's always been reliable in helping me make a great cup of tea. I mostly use it in the summer to brew super strong tea for iced sweet tea and in the winter when I switch over to hot chai so it sees a decent amount of regular use. Since I prefer decaf coffee, sometimes take it with me when I travel, that way the host(ess) doesn't have to go to any special trouble; I just bring a zip lock bag with either my tea or ground coffee and hot water is never hard to come by. This is an excellent infuser!"
4,Great tea lover gift,"I bought this for my girlfriend about 7 months ago and she continues to use it for her loose leaf teas. It is really useful and long lasting. Plus, we have not noticed any change in flavor by using this plastic appliance."
5,Awesome!,"Great teapot, very convenient and (why not?) funny to use. It's enough for 2 cupfuls and everyday usage.Perfect for tea lovers!"
5,Great Brewer,"I found this teapot works exactly as advertised. I use it every day with no problems. I was glad to see it has a replaceable filter. Hint, the filter inserts easier if you place it in the freezer for ten minutes and heat the mug with hot water. The filter will then insert with less effort."
3,Missing the plate stand!,"I bought this for myself some time ago, it works well and would be 5 stars or so, and now bought a couple more as a gift, however they were missing the round plate that you put it on to avoid drips on your table.. Not sure how this happens, the products looked new. :("
5,A Fantastic Product,"I saw this demonstrated on the Today Show in December 2010 and ordered one for my wife, who is an avid tea drinker. It is fantastic. It does just what it says it will do, which is kind of rare today. It is simple to use, when you're finished just dump the tea leaves and put the whole thing in the dishwasher. The price is very reasonable for a product of this quality. Overall, we love it. We've since ordered four more as gifts for friends and family."
1,Disappointed,"I absolutely loved this teapot while it worked, but within just 4 months of receiving it, it now leaks all the water out. I walked by into my kitchen expecting a lovely cup of tea and found instead a huge mess. It had leaked all over my counter. My bread was sogged, my towel stained, my cookbook stained and warped. I am, of course, outside my return time as you only have 30 days. I feel this item is too expensive to be that disposable. Very disappointed in the quality of this product."
1,Tea Pot leaks in its stand and flooded my work bench,"Bought this based on reviews - big tea drinker and bought additional ones for gifts.The first time I used it -- it did work.The second time, it leaked while brewing in the stand and flooded my kitchen workspace with tea -- which does stain btw.Either I have received faulty items or it is cheap trash. Or both."
5,Amazing!,"I received one of these as a gift 4 or 5 years ago, since then I have given them as gifts to several family members who also drink loose tea frequently. The new model doesn't have a loose filter like my old one, that was my only complaint but it wasn't a deal breaker.Loose tea is often meant to be used more than once, and this allows you to drain out your tea before you start extracting bitterness. It's convenient at work, where I have access to the water cooler and the saucer keeps me from making a mess on my desk.I would definitely buy another one if mine were to break because I love it so much!"
5,Perfect - Exactly what we needed!,We wanted to be able to brew some of our loose leaf teas without all the hassle and this fit the bill. A bit cheaper than the teavana version and from what I can tell it works perfectly.Was a bit skeptical about it leaking on the counter after the tea is dispensed in your mug but that has not been an issue. Its a simple device but it works great!
5,Very good,"As someone mentioned before, If you like loose tea then this Tea maker is the one to get. It's perfect in every way and I concur with all the positive reviews."
4,It works,"*Easy to use.*Makes a perfect cup of tea with no leaves*Better than a tea ball*SturdyOnly con: difficult to clean.Overall, we use it often. The coolest part is placing it on top of a mug and seeing the tea drain out."
3,Good for coffee?,A question.Will this work with coffee and has anybody tried it with good results? Adagio's website is silent on the coffee issue.I have purchased the Clever Coffee Dripper from Amazon which works on the same principle and makes great coffee. Unfortunately it is small and makes only one cup at a time.
5,Nice,This is a really nice product. My only complaint is that it is made from plastic. The quality is very good. I bought it as a gift for my daughter so I can not really say how well it works. I would not hesitate to buy one for myself.
4,Tea for One?,"Perfect for brewing tea with loose tea, and if you love your tea, you prefer tea brewed from loose tea leaves. Ingenious engineering; easy to use. Must have for your loose leaf tea drinker!"
5,Just what i was looking for!,"I love this! I had purchased a mug in China that was similar, but only brewed about 4 ounces at a time. This teapot is much more efficient and can brew a full cup (16 ounces). The best part is that it keeps everything very tidy. I found other loose tea options (tea spoon, or tea ball) to be really messy and only good for one cup. With this, i can add my tea, brew it and keep the leaves inside the pot for a second brew.The only problem that i have had is that the Jasmine Tea i like is long and stringy. A couple of times, the tea strands have blocked the plunger at the bottom so it is open and doesn't hold water. This problem hasn't impacted the plunger overall, it works perfectly once i have cleaned and re-loaded with new tea."
3,"love it, but...does it contain BPA?","been using 2 of these almost every day for several years, and recommended it to everyone. BUT, now that i can't confirm they don't contain BPA, i'm ditching them both, and going with the Teavana product because Teavana says theirs is BPA-free plastic."
1,This item is junk,"I purchased this brewer approximately 2 months ago. The inside straining piece is constantly coming loose, even after i tried gluing it in place. It has also come loose while the tea is brewing. Unrelated to this problem, I have had 2 tea floods after I filled the brewer with hot water, and before staining. The bottom is somehow leaking. This one is going in the recycle bin. I will purchase a new one from Teavana."
1,Hot water + plastic = a bad idea,"I've written a review of this product a few months ago, stating the facts about so called ""food grade plastic"". The simple fact is hot liquid and plastic shouldn't be used as food containers. If it's safe to use ""food grade plastic"" for hot liquid, then why do almost all coffee and tea cups are made of glass or metal? Do your own research on this subject.To Amazon, what is the point for us to spend our time to write reviews when Amazon removes reviews based on sellers/manufacturers' request?"
5,Don't hesitate...this is the one,"I recently switched to loose tea because of the cost savings. I was looking for something I could use at work and read multiple reviews. I was concerned that this might be a bit ""Mickey Mouse"" as my husband calls it, so I also purchased a more traditional stainless steel ultra fine tea infuser. The Ingenuitea BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER!!! I love that it is microwave safe, BPA free, and it filters the tea so well- better than the ""ultra fine"" infuser. No tea dust at the bottom of your cup. It doesn't make a mess all over your desk and its just fun. If you drink loose tea, you really need to get this thing."
5,Outstanding,"I just started drinking tea, mainly from bags or the keurig machine at work. Then I notice my friends Adagio teapot and had to get myself one. Loose tea taste so much better than the tea I was getting from the Keurig. This little teapot is easy to use and easy to clean. It is very easy to dispense tea from the teapot without making a mess. Fantastic product."
5,Easy to use and clean,"This is very easy to use and clean. I bought the 32oz version. Based on the video review I saw featured, I thought the filter would be removable, but it isn't. I was also expecting a little tray to set it on, but I didn't get one of those either. That aside, it kept the tea really warm, and it was easy to rinse out afterwards. The only issue I have with it is if you are putting it in a cup smaller than the amount of water you have, you can't see how full the cup is without having to keep lifting it up to see if it's full yet :)"
2,Filter Floats Up,"The filter that fits into the bottom of the unit keeps floating up. Basically the did not design it tight enought to fit. So now you have a boiling hot cup of water and your trying to manipulate the filter back in with spoons. No fun. I emailed them and they suggested preheating it with hot water. The filter then expand and stays. I don't want to have to add steps to compensate for their design/manufacturing mistakes.I now wedge it in tightly with a strip of tea bag (bought the roll your own tea bag assortment) That works, but again. Shouldn't happen.There is a competing product with a large, wide bowl. I would try that one instead. Another advantage, the wider bowl will allow you to load the filter more easily. I have a large hand and its hard to fit it into ingenuitieas narrow cup.On a positive note their tempored clear glass teapot is great. Tea stays Hot for 20+ minutes."
2,filter gets loose,Sad to report but I'm another purchaser who had a couple of good months of usage then the filter started getting loose and now at least 50% of the time the filter just floats off while brewing wasting another mug of tea.Have a competitor's product that I keep at work that I've had twice as long and use twice as much and that one never has the filter floating away (perhaps because that one is made of metal).
3,"Good Product, Could be Improved","I've used this teapot for a few weeks now, and think it is a decent product, but needs some improvement. I bought it based on a recommendation from Cook's Illustrated.Pros:-Holds 4 cups of hot water to steep tea-Easy to clean-Tea does not get stuck in filter or pot-Dispenses into different shaped and sized mugsCons:-Lid is hinged, but does not come off, so you can't just put it in the dishwasher-Filter pops out if you don't situate it properly in the bottom of the pot before brewing. It can take a minute to align the filter in the bottom of the pot.-Plastic absorbs color and smell of teaUpdate:After the infuser dropped on the floor and the lid popped off, I discovered the lid can be removed to place this in the dishwasher.There is not much give in the plastic, so be careful taking it off or it may break."
5,Tea brewer and conversation piece,"I saw this item reviewed on a PBS cooking show, and I agree that it does work very well. Also, tea brewed with whole tea leaves is so much more flavorful than it is when made with teabags. I won't ever buy a teabag again. It is also a great conversation piece at work when people ask what the gadget is. The only thing that I don't like about it is cleaning the wet tea leaves out after I've brewed my tea. That part is a little annoying, but worth the effort for such great tasting tea."
5,SV-lady,Have tried most tea brewers and tea pots on the market. Adagio is the best of all. Have used mine for 3 months and would not be without.
4,Works well,"I like this ""teapot."" I've had it for about it a month and it works very well so far. I haven't had any of the problems with the filter or release mechanism mentioned in the few negative reviews. (I have the 16 oz version.)"
4,Kellogg on Branding : The Marketing Faculty of The Kellogg School of Management,"This book is written by academics and it shows. While there are many good ideas and insightful analysis, it is essentially a compilation of papers written by academics. Accordingly, there is little flow to the book, which makes it somewhat of a difficult, if not boring, read."
4,The first 2-3 Chapters are extremely helpful to people unfamiliar with Branding as a concept and the need for a strategy,"I haven't made it through the entire book yet. However, had I bought this book sooner, I would have gotten a basic understanding of branding much sooner and saved a lot of time. Instead, I did a lot of my own research on the web and reading blogs. My independent research was helpful, but it took substantially more time than simply reading the first couple of chapters."
1,No USB Host! ! !,"The Amazon Product Description clearly indicates the presence of a USBHost on the front panel of this receiver. The product I received has none. This was a deal breaker for me. I did some research & as far as I can determine, the European model DOES have this feature but the U.S./Canada version does not. Also, the price has dropped twice in the week since my purchase but Amazon apparently will no longer price match themselves."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I don't know how these things work. Black magic?Just add water, microwave for 45 seconds, and out comes a cookie. No idea how that works, any cookies or brownies I've made need milk, oil, eggs, SOMETHING.Regardless, it works well. Tastes pretty darn good, too. It's more of a cake type of a cookie than a real cookie but it still tastes good which is the main point, right?As a note, don't over microwave these because the plastic will melt and the cookie will burn."
3,A Quick but Disappointing Fix for the Sweet-Tooth,"After seeing these quick, single-portion snacks in the market I decided to order a large package to keep them in the pantry to satisfy those sweet-treat cravings. The product is disappointing in both it's size and quality. A slightly more generous portion would help to satisfy the late night snack urge; the quality is okay. I ultimately decided not to keep these in stock in the pantry - they don't quite hit the mark."
2,no as good as it looks,I thought this would be a lot better than it turned out to be very small portion and it does not look as good as how it is shown in the picture..it was okay not great
5,slide-of-hand tricks!,"This video shows where great drummers, such as Dennis Chambers, have learned some of the best hand technique in drumming today! A must for todays drummer."
2,Not what I thought,"I expected this set to last me a long time. I bought this cookware set with the hopes of keeping it for at least five years. Within the first year, it began to rust. It just didn't meet the demands of cooking or cleaning."
1,Awful! Non-stick surface coming off already.,"In spite of not using the dishwasher, this product is falling to bits. It was a gift for my daughter's 18th birthday and she's only been using it since April. Avoid!!!"
4,"Psychedelic, hard to find and interesting","I bought this collection a couple of years back and I've been delighted with it. It has grown on me and I felt I should do my bit to bring Daytripper's average up. Don't get me wrong, this music isn't going to be to everyone's taste. If you want a greatest hits collection, this ain't it. However, if you think you might like a bunch of off the wall and just plain interesting stuff which might take you years to collect elsewhere, this is for you. PS Just who is Snagrom anyway? Jonestown was in '74, I think, so this can't be a sixties track can it?"
3,A Mixed Bag - like the '60s were!,"I can't say that this is really a *definitive* collection, but it has its virtues. I count 13 hit singles from the time in their original versions, and more if you allow for non-original versions (like the sitar version of Heart Full of Soul). And there are other old favorites here that were not hit singles: my folk group used to do two of the three Donovan songs, and we get some souvenirs of great acts that never topped the charts, like Dr. John, Pentagle, Captain Beefheart and John Lee Hooker. Sure, there's some filler, but if you think the '60s was all hit singles and superstars... either you weren't there, or you were, but can't remember it! For the price, this isn't a bad package for those who don't already have most of these songs on other recordings, or those who'd like to unload the old vinyl copies!"
1,You've Got To Be Kidding!,"What is this? Except for half a dozen semi-decent songs, the rest sound like a 60's compilation of studio rejects; a ""worst songs of the 60's"" by dorkie-named groups I never knew existed. Folks, save your money! Even at the price, this box set is a total rip-off. Don't be fooled by the names of good bands; their songs are crappy as well."
5,Best recording of the Dvorak Symphonies,"The Penguin Guide classical music recording review guide book gave these recordings an unfavorable review. Shame on them! These are absolutely the BEST Dvorak symphony recordings I've ever heard (and I listened to several before finding these). Excellent recorded sound, too. You can hear every part of the orchestra very clearly. What you have here is an excellent Czech orchestra (the Czech Phil is one of the best orchestras in the world, in my opinion), guided by a Czech conductor performing music of a Czech composer. My only complaint is the 2nd,5th, and 8th symphonies are divided between 2 CDs, so you have to change discs between the 2nd and 3rd movements in those two symponies. But with playing, interpretation, and recording quality as good as this, it's acceptable. Highly recommended!!"
2,More bad then good here,The lighting is poor and the sound quality is poor. One of the dance numbers is flat out annoying and the solo singing is not really enjoyable due to the sound quality. Probably the last three dance numbers are the best but hard to watch with the lighting and camera action. I am an avid tango junkie and I will probably put this video on a shelf and never watch it again.
3,I alway expect to much,"I think the problem with these kind of movies, is mine own interpretation of the tha tango, the choreography is realy good i have to admit, some things are funny, but still I miss the tension , real passion. In my eyes this show has to much choreography. But that is because I dance for myself, and then you are always looking to other aspects of the dance. But if you are not an experienced dancer, than this show is great to view"
4,Funny but short,The Rock was always great on the microphone. His interviews and promos were some of the best any WWE superstar have ever done. This dvd is a recap of what he said on the mic and a some key matches from the year. Its a good dvd but goes by way to fast. The bonus interviews and promos are awesome but they are really short only two last more then three minutes. There are no bonus matches and that kind of hurts the dvd. Still a very good buy for a Rock fan or just want to remember the good ol days of wrestling.
4,PEOPLES DVD!,this is a great video on the rock.........had all his main macthes though 99-start of 2000....was very well done with all his promos which was funny as....ive got the tape version not the dvd.....im shore it is 50times better on dvd.honestly in my opion i like the rock video know your role a bit better.probably because i liked him in that cocky atittude. but got nothing against this one...he shows you his shops and where he gets his hair cut...a must get for any rock fans!
5,The Androids Saga..,is one of the best. Although i 've only seen the japanese (uncut) version i think you won't be disappointed by the english one. And dont't think that Goku and Trunks are the only Super-Saiyajins..... A must buy for a true Dragonball fan!
2,The Nutcracker/The Royal Ballet,"I felt the director and choreographer took too much liberty in deviating from the original. I have seen many live and recorded versions of the Nutcracker, including the famous Ruth Page version in Chicago which ran annually for over 25 years. Never before have I seen such dowdy costumes in the opening party scene, or men dancing in the Waltz of the Flowers. What bothered me the most was the complete omission of Mother Ginger, one of my favorite characters in the ballet. Additionally, I though the inclusion of a suitor for Clara in the party scene was unnecessary.I did appreciate the work done by the dancers who played Clara and the Sugar Plum Fairy."
4,Es un clásico muy bonito.,"La version es antigua, pero es muy bonita, el vestuario, los bailes, las variaciones. La disfrutamos mucho."
1,BLEH...,"This is blasphemy. It should be made with brown sugar and butter (topping) not their disgusting topping mix containing partially hydrogenated soybean oil, cottonseed oil and corn starch. The topping was absolutly DISGUSTING. Not to mention it makes only a very small cake. I will NEVER EVER EVER buy another Betty Crocker Pineapple upside-down cake mix again. I would have given negative stars but you can't do that. So for the incompetent people who can't cook or taste anything, this is probably right up your ally."
2,Bland but harmless,"This is unexciting but inoffensive music that in some situations would be quite appropriate, like, say, a cocktail party of middle-aged people in the burbs who think they'd be pretty cool if only they weren't saddled with the car payments, the kids ..... The band loses a star for implying they're freaks when they're obviously not. C'mon guys, you missed that boat by 20 years, you were either there or you weren't. Accept it and move on."
1,Absolutely Dreadful,"I must say, this dreadful little disc brings teen pop to an all-time low. Not only have they got young kids singing such promiscuous hits as Come Clean and Car Wash, these kids sound terrible. Their voices are flat and no amount of studio editing can make these kids sound any better. In a world where teen pop is about as common as cockroaches in a kitchen, the fact that little CHILDREN are singing songs that appeal far more to a TEEN audience just seems wrong.You can easily tell that none of these kids will EVER get a record contract. Why didn't they just have these ""Mini Pop Kids"" lip-sync to the actual lyrics? Their voices sound frail and weak against the actual music of the hits. Please, don't buy this CD. Buy the REAL hits themselves and don't bother with this load of absolute rubbish."
1,Annoying... VERY annoying,"Let me put it this way... If you gave this as a gift to your child, it would be a good excuse for your kid to contact social services."
2,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!,"When I saw the commercail for this me and my friend were cracking up laughing.Especaily when it showed them singing My Happy Ending by Avril Lavigne...Avril?Are you actually leting them do that?Their singing sticks,but I guess its good for a laugh.Especaily when they sing ""Were Is the Love"".The boy who's singing the line ""Let your soul gravitate to the love,y'all"" THATS NOT HIS VOICE.This kid is like,what,9 and he's singing with an adult voice.riiiigghhht...."
2,golfing with god,"A quasi-philosophical book, the message of which we have all heard before. The best parts were the descriptions of the golf matches. Mr Merullo's conception of Bhuddism sounds good, but are not up to the facts. Go to Bhutan and see the Bhuddist fortresses, and one will see even the Bhuddists war and plunder."
4,4.5 really!,"Extremely readable, very inspiring, and thought provoking!Reading this prompted me to read Breakfast with Budda by Roland Merullo!Easily 4.5 stars!"
5,Great book for anyone familiar with golf regardless of religious affiliation,This was a wonderful book that I have lent to so many people I had to go buy myself a new one. No religious affiliations are made. If you believe in a supreme being it's for you. A great mix of humor in the story. You do need to have a working knowledge of golf terminology. I particularly liked the chapter where the protagonist golfs with Buddha. I truly felt inner peace at the end of that chapter.
1,Not recommended.,"Not recommended. This Walker sensor failed within a year, and I was unable to get it replaced under the 1-year warranty. I bought another well known brand sensor at a comparable price that has been working fine since."
1,Completely plagiarized; do not purchase,Gregory Evans has plagiarized this book and as such it should not be purchased. Please see the following source:[...]
4,Spyware Book Review,"This book happens to be the best reference guide on Spyware I've been able to find up to this date. Although the first few chapters failed to provide some of the url's/links associated with the articles, it was still usefull in creating a starting point for further research.The majority of the book is filled with usefull information and I was able to identify the various types of spyware on my machine and remove them without incident. The powerpoint presentations were easy to follow and when I found that I had additional questions I merely contacted the author, Mr. Evans who was very professional and eager to answer my specific questions.Overall I give this reference guide 4 stars because of the vast amount of information it provides from news articles to working programs provided on the CD which accompanies the book."
4,Gorgeous and evocative story of obsession.,"This film is very close to five stars for me. It is exquistely beautiful and lusciously erotic. For more than half the movie I was mesmerized. My reservation is that there are, probably deliberately, a lot of mysteries and unexplained bits that add up to some unnecessary confusion. I minded them more after the film was over than while I was caught up in its spell. Leconte has become a favorite director, and I also love The Girl on the Bridge, Monsieur Hire, The Hairdresser's Husband, and The Man on the Train."
2,Ok Movie,I bought this movie expecting some kind of nostalgia or sensuality but ended up feeling depressed. It didn't work for me and the picture quality was not all that great.
1,the perfume of yvonne,"DEAR ALL , I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE WAS RATED 5 STARS IN AMAZON, DEFINITLY HARDLY WILL GIVE ONE STAR..I PAID A LOT OF MONEY IS NOT WORTHED.FROM NOW ONWARDS I WILL NOT GUIDE MYSELF DEPENDING OF THE STAR THAT AMAZONSHOWING IN HIS WEB SIDE.SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY..I CAN SELL MINE FOR HALF PRICE..I WISH I COULD RETURN N GET THE REFUND."
2,Great Idea! Bad code!,"So I'm going throught the book and decide to start in part IV ""product requirements"". After reading the whole section (several chapters), I decide to install the code on my own CFDev server so that I can see the app I've been reading about in action. Long story short, I can fill a phone book with the errors I've found and recieved.Sure, I can spend 2 or 3 days going through the code and rewritting the application. But at that point, the book is no longer valid. So while it has been fun to read emails from Teo to the team about how to develop the application, the final product doesn't work.I've been using ColdFusion for 5 years. I thought that I should point that out.I haven't tried the other Apps in the book yet. Maybe they work. Maybe they don't!"
1,Don't Bother Buying This Book,"You'll be very disappointed if you buy this book. The code is full of errors and doesn't work. Save your money, look around, and buy something else. You'll be wasting your money on this one."
4,Easy Read,"Good, easy to read. Informative but I needed pinpoint information on one particular subject. I would recommend to friends though."
4,Good Resource,"I wanted to learn how to juice, and this book was good as a good start. Once you start juicing, you figure out what you like and don't like."
4,Good First Juicing Guide,"This book is very informative. It gives excellent information on ailments and nutrition - not just juices - that can assist in improving the condition of those afflicted by the ailments. Just wish that the reader could get a more direct link between ingredient lookup and recipes that contain the ingredient.So far, I have been pleased with the combination of the book and my first juicer, the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor 1 EA67650. I also sent both to a friend."
3,juice,I have so many of these juicing books but it is a good one and I would recommend it. There are only so many combinations when juicing.
1,took 3weeks to get a book,ordered 14th of Jan and got just today end of Jan.it's too so long. i did not get any explanationsupset.
5,"Juice Lady, Cherie Calbom, is extraordinarily helpful for good health!","THE JUICE LADY'S GUIDE TO JUICING FOR HEALTH: UNLEASHING THE HEALING POWER OF WHOLE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, IS ONE OF THE MOST HELPFUL BOOKS FOR GOOD HEALTH I'VE READ. I HAD NEVER DONE ANY JUICING BEFORE, BUT IS HAS HELPED ME TO REFOCUS MY NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT MANY TIMES, AND IT'S WORKING!IN ADDITION, JUICING IS A GREAT WAY TO GET NATURAL VITAMINS INTO YOUR DIET. MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I HAVEN'T QUITE FIGURED HOW NOT TO WASTE FRUITS OR VEGGIES BECAUSE I'M USUALLY SO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT JUICING AND ALL THE RECIPES WHICH I CAN PLAY AROUND WITH."
3,Not what I expected.,"Although the book was not what I expected , it was as advertised. Great price, good service."
3,informative yet redundant,"Last year at x-mas my wife and decided that since we just had a baby and funds were low,that we would buy each other one gift that we picked out around $20.00.I picked a beard trimmer and my wife picked out the Juice Ladys book.So I thought I would be nice and buy her two Juice Ladys books.Well the books came and I looked through them,and found to my surprise that the same recipes were printed throughout both books.A lot of the recipes can be used for the same things.So instead of printing the recipe then putting what it can be used for the recipes are reprinted over and over.So in retrospect I suggest buying one book instead of two or three with different titles,because they have the same recipes.I hope this has been of some help for those looking to buy this or other Juice Lady books."
2,Not our style of humor,"Based on the rave reviews, I bought this for my husband. Rather than the ""clever"" or ""play on words"" type of humor we like, this is more like ""slapstick"" or ""laugh at the silly"". It is great as far as good, clean fun goes, and is probably more funny to younger people - even Jr.High/High School - than for us."
5,Nice,Just what I needed for my gross anatomy lab. I prefer to have full PPE on when I'm in the wet lab.
5,John Allen Gorre & Daphetid,Super book about the late John Allen's masterpiece. Many photos in B&W due to time they were taken but a few color shots also. Lots of detail. If you missed any of these stories in MR here is your chance to relive those days.
4,'Gory and Defeated',"A celebrated,though naturally,dated review of one of the most inspirational American model train layouts ever! no modern,updated version can be possible due to the layout's tragic destruction by fire ,days after it's owner's own sad death."
4,"A Fine Pamphlet, But Not a Manual","Warfighting was written for the Marine unfamiliar with maneuver warfare to pick up, flip through, memorize the axioms, and apply in battle. As such, like most other field manuals issued to soldiers, it is a distillation of a large swath of ideas from Sun Tzu to Liddell-Hart. That said, it packs a good punch for such a small work. If, however, you're looking for a more detailed illustration of the principles outlined here, you might take a look at B.H. Liddell-Hart's ""Strategy"" as well as Thomas Cleary's translation of Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War.""Additionally, those westerners who enjoy axioms focusing on the flux of life, war, or what have you might also like to take a look at Heraclitus' ""Fragments."" The basic tenets of Taoism that permeate Sun Tzu (and, by proxy, ""Warfighting"") can be equally well found in Heraclitus. His primary ""thesis"" if you will, ""nothing is stationary, life is flux,"" is the axiom upon which maneuver warfare strategy is founded."
5,"Buy a copy for the office, lend it to everyone.",Good book to instill leadership qualities in your workforce. This should be the basis for required college course in all business degree programs.
3,More than war,I believe the priciples presented in Warfighting have a broader application than physical combat. In life we encounter situations where the understanding and applying of these principles could help.
4,Great Book for any Delaware Resident,The setting of the book is the State Of Delaware.Ebert does a great job keeping the action moving.For anyone living in Delaware it is a great read.For the other 49 States it is an interesting read.It is very timely for 2011.
4,Book of Shadows: Hauntingly Intense,"I loved the music on this CD! The music is wonderfully enchanting and stayed with me long after listening....especially ""Ophelia's Lament"". This CD is totally awesome inspite of the lead vocal's lack of variety."
4,"If you like Rock and Witchcraft, buy it.",It's a nice cd. There are too few cd's out there related to Witches or Pagans alike. This cd takes you on a nice magickal/musical journey with an 80's type sound. My only dissapointment was they didn't include the song Outcasts on it.
3,Book of Shadows,I picked this up at a store on vacation a few weeks ago and wondered if you all carried it here. The voice of Tiesin is haunting and mesmorizing. He would be awesome solo too. Arrangements seemed ackward on a couple of songs. Spirit itself seems to move in his voice better than the accompaniment.
2,It is alright.,"My question is what would they do without all the witch hype.( Dont you think that ""The Witch Schtick"" has been overplayed)I bought the CD and the songs where ok. The singer voice is good. However, some of the PAINFULLY midi sounding music featured on this CD was akin to a sixth graders music project.I expected a better quality of music."
2,Witch hype!,"I bought the CD. Without all the Pagan attentions this would be nothing more than glorified elevator music set to midi guitars and a drum set. I heard that the singer was the only pagan/witch , and is no longer with this group.( I guess it is hard to be the only believer in a group that is full of wanna-bes) Where is the all the magick.... Try again....better luck next time. We Pagan folks are not easily fooled and know who WE are!"
1,terrible terrible!,"Don't bother. The travel charger is only good for the car, when using plugged into the wall it charges for about a half second at a time. Half on, half off. The handsfree stopped working after a week. I put the vent clip on and tried to adjust it and it broke. Very poor quality and very cheaply made."
2,Bulky but ok...,"This is a sturdy case with inserts front and back to protect the unit which is nice, but it doubles the thickness of the unit. It's a complete cover, which renders the ""+"" inaccessable while it's closed, only the volume side button is useful because the other ones require you see the screen to use them.It also seems to open backwards, like the unit is upside down in it or something. So in the end, it's better than having your screen scratched, but I would (and still am) looking for other options."
3,Scalpmaster terry lined shower cap,"I like this shower cap because it is terry-lined, but there is no band around it. It does not keep water out around my back neck area and I think the band would help. Also, it is rather a big cap that doesn't fit snug around my head. It looks rather cheaply made. A band around it would certainly improve the look and purpose of the shower cap."
3,works fine but color is ridiculously loud & bright,"""assorted"" color came as the loudest, brightest day-glo pink imaginable. The cap is fine - just the color seems a bit loud for anyone over 5 years old."
2,Basic Premise Good,"This is a movie about a boy who is bullied for his Protestant Christian faith; he meets the martyr St. Stephen,and is taken on a journey to see the plights of Christians throughout common history. After these events, he finds the strength to stand up for his beliefs. The basic premise is very good.The film as a whole, however, is weak. The half-hour-long video is full of flat characters, poor sound quality, and - in the Tyndale scene - faulty and juvenile history.This video is not suitable for any kind of catechetical instruction; it's redeeming quality is that it may help children ages 9-12 to stand up for what they believe in."
2,NOT THE SAME,"I purchased these dental chews from my Vet for years and he highly recommended them. He retired and I could not find them anywhere until KV PET through Amazon. The chews I purchased from my Vet looked the same on the outside but inside were a hard brown almost granular substance and my dogs really liked them and I felt they did a good job helping keep their teeth clean. However, the Advanced Dental Chews from KV PET looked black on the inside like burned charcoal and my dogs will not take them. Don't know what the problem is but these are now on a storage shelf and I guess I'll end up throwing them out. Bad batch maybe?"
5,One of the best MST3K movies ever!,"If you have never watched any Mystery Science Theatre 3000 movies before, this is a great place to start! The movie is so bad, but the ongoing dialog with host Mike Nelson and robots Crow and Tom Servo makes it hilarious. A must see for MST3K fans - and newbies!"
5,Too Funny For Words,"I am an avid MST 3000 viewer ever since my brother-in-law recorded one long ago and gave it to me to watch. I have passed over this one title many times for who knowa why? However, I have laughed more at this one in the first 15 minutes than I have at others through the whole movie, so much so that I paused it to write this review! Do Not, What Ever You Do, Pass This One Up! The attic scene could be a short in itself!Now, back to the movie!"
4,Hahahahah!!,"MST is so funny, I just love it! This episode was no exception. This one is my second fave (so far) to Werewolf. There are so many more to watch!"
4,Good Tango Orillero but bad camera work,"The only reason this video does not get five stars is the camera work. Too many changes of angle, too many half body shots. This is an excellent Tango cabaret show. The dancers are limited in the stage they are on. They are on a raised platform only about nine feet round. The dancers range from expert to master level. There are some great moves in this video. I mean some of the moves I said,""O, my God"". Overall the standard of Tango dancers is highest in this video. Solo singers, solo dancers, couples, small group dances. Well worth buying. 50 minutes."
1,Tango for Tourists,"This tango is for tourists only. For people from North America, Turkey, Japan, etc. It's very very unreal. Very fancy, very showy, but not real."
5,This is an amazing watch!,"This watch really is amazing. I bought it for my father, and if another comes in stock at the store I bought it ($150 at Costco), I might just have to get one for me, because I've been checking it out, and it's great. Lightweight, as titanium is, but durable. The band is more rigid than on Skagan titanium watches, but pretty similar to any other titanium watch I've seen or used. The technology in this is just amazing - you can use it for diving, it doesn't need batteries, even without sun or lights, it works for 6 months from a full charge. I had a few issues setting the date, because the space between ""clicks"" is small. The ""day"" indicator is in Italian for PM, English for AM - and so far I'm not really a fan of that. A lot more details can be found here:http://citizenwatch.com/us/technical/full_inst/full_english/E100_ebook.pdf"
3,okay,This guitar stand works very well. It holds my Ibanez very well. My only complain is that the padding on the base is very weak. They started tearing after a while.
3,Doesnt works for me,"I bought it to use in stage, but didnt work for me. The angle is too down. It's really portable but is not the safer for stage. Maybe if you used in house or school could be better."
4,Standup for Guitars,"Fender came up with a fine electric guitar holder - one of two new models, the other for acoustic guitars. Well built, reliable, folds up, takes little room to care around. Ideal for gigs as well as studio and home. Solid performer. - Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus'"
5,Great Stand,This fender mini guitar stand is great t's just what I needed for my syudio and also when I am playing at different venues. I don't like the standard size guitar stands for some reason something strange always happens to knock over my guitar and it's always the extended part of the stand that your neck rests on thats the culprit. This stand is strong and well balanced I couldn't be happier. I also ordered it late on Monday night and they got it out to me by Weds with just the regular shipping which was another bonus.
1,Wobbled,Product was returned. The stand we received wobbled and was in no way going to safely hold the electric guitar.Purchased another brand at the local music store which was slightly bigger and it works great.Do not recommend.
2,Choose something else,It is not the size for mini guitar. May be for the big one...Connections are shaky. You will surely notice that the quality is toooo low.
5,Fender Mini Stand,"This has to be one of the best stands on the market. I was a little leary as I just received my custom made Fender Strat and when I saw mini I thought of something cheaply made. I actually was amazed at how well it is made. It is everything you want in a stand. It is compact , sturdy with an ease of set up design. When traveling I even fold it up and place it in my inside coat pocket. I have friends in the band with full size stands that don't work half as well. After trying mine once, they all went out and placed orders for their own. An excellent value."
3,Good for what it's worth,"I have owned two of these stands. The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared. The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place. Not the greatest stands by any means, but for what they're worth, I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one. Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable. But price, ability to collapse, and it's light weight made it the one I bought... again."
5,Fender Guitar Stand,"Best stand ever made for working musicians playing a solid-bodied electric guitar. I have five of 'em and they go with me everywhere. Most important, to me, they fit in the case."
2,I really wanted to like this stand...,"I purchased this stand for my daughter's new mini strat. She received both for Christmas. The guitar is great, but the stand is very disappointing, even at the inexpensive price I paid. It is made for the fender mini guitar, but it does not hold the guitar. It slides right through. I am going to have my husband modify it so it will work, but I am disappointed in the product I received. it seems that it would work fine for a full size guitar but not the mini for which it is labeled."
2,Not for mini guitars,The Fender Mini Guitar Stand is apparently not for mini guitars. The name is misleading and it doesn't help that amazon puts it as Frequently Bought Together with the Squier by Fender Mini Guitar which my daughter has. I can tell you for sure this stand does not work with the Squier Mini Guitar it slips through the arms and then the whole stand falls over. I even tried bending the arms a little closer together to no avail. As for regular size guitars this may not be a bad stand seems to be decent quality.
1,terrible dvd,"This dvd was of poor quality, and was basically a few guys sitting around talking about the Foo Fighters. Don't waste your time or money- BIG disappointment."
4,I was impressed,"Great variety of music, country, blues, gospel, rock, bluegrass. I'm surprised more of these didn't hit higher on some music charts. Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, the Staples, cool stuff."
4,"Great Performance & Price, but . . .","play any game at 1024X768 smoothly at high fps, and some games at 1280X1024 like Buttlefield-2 it is much better than my previous MSI 6600 diamond edition, but the fan is noisy when the game start also I can't overclock it too much (only 600Mhz core - 1600Mhz memory) beyond this speed the system freeze and get hang comparing it to my previous MSI 6600 DE which has very good overclocking potintial."
2,Did not last long,Good balance between performance/cost. But it stopped working after only 15 months of use.
3,Kinda funny,"For the 45 minutes of music, there are a lot of (shorter) tracks to hear here, but sometimes you get the feeling that it was better to release a few more early singles rather than letting the demos shelved. However, Soft Cell chose not to do that and waited to sign to a major (Mercury) and put some singles out. Here is an early sign of what you got at the first album (Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret). But let us not forget that there was more than this material, there was this record by Some Bizarre which was called Mutant Moments. Soft Cell fans would want that one to finally collect... this is a hint for Some Bizarre... ;-)"
5,Very original music,"This combination of bagpipes, medieval instruments and celtic-rock music is very original. I recently dicovered this and now I became a happy listener of Corvus Corax."
5,Music for the Ages,"What I love about Corvus Corvax is that they open your ears to the idea that that music of the distant past wasn't all pomp, lace and frills. The medieval man (or woman) in street really could party with his 21st century offspring."
5,Must see for parents and kids.,"This production brings it all home; rules, methods of playing and the importance of teamwork. The use of animated characters keeps the kids interested and the coaching fits right in. My kids really liked watching people like themselves learning for the first time. It just made the first trip to the practice a lot better than it could have been. I learned a lot about the rules of the game, so it has helped me to answer questions that my kids ask. There's nothing else like it available and I really recommend it."
2,Different,I thought this book was strange. The auther keeps saying the same things over and over. A good book if you like to be bored.
2,The auther knows zip,The person who wrote this book knows nothing about the BEST breed in the world!
2,Especially non technical.,"No technical, helpful details. Owner lacks this pet and does not seem to have much experience with animals in general. The facts are basically known and cheaply categorized. Book may be one of the most unpopular manuals published and sold around stores. In my opinion, this did not need to be published in any case. Least though, the topic is a particular dog breed, which is fine.The manual is hardback, but does not deserve to be refurbished as much as other, more deserving manuals. Opinions differ in every respect, however this guide should not be bought by ones who presume it is a technical, fact containing guide. M. Siegal should have deciphered between publishing sub par material or making another attempt."
1,Uninteresting,"One of my friends bought me this book for my birthday. She told me it had alot of nice reviews so it must be a good book. She couldn't have been further from the truth. I settled down to start reading it with my two Golden Retrievers, Andy and Jessi. I was bored to tears by the second page. The auther goes on and on saying the same things over and over. I wish my friend had just given me a card!"
2,freestyle explosion,"There are some good songs like ""only in my dreams"" and songs by Cynthia, Michelle Diaz, and Jesse. The problem that i had with this cd is that it looks cheaply done. The cover is terrible and badly printed,the artists names are spelled wrong like lil'suzy and even their own artist Michelle Diaz, there is alot of errors and confuses the shopper when they want to buy the artists single or album. But it is not a bad cd , there are alot of good songs,just bad artistic style and a couple of the song on the cd are not freestyle. Just an ok comp."
5,An informative introduction to statistics and their uses.,"These essays examine some of the basic concepts involved in bringing statistical argument to the table, and considers the history of statistics and their methods and use. Essential to any college-level math course on the topic, Statistics on the Table probes how statisticians link statistics to social issues and daily life, providing essays which examine statistical ideas and their impact."
4,Good,"This is a neat, spiral-bound book for beginner sewers. I lays flat, the wonderfully clear text and pictures are easy to follow. I would recommend it as a handy reference for new sewers. It is written in a clear and concise form that makes it not difficult to follow.I am sure I will hand this down to my children's children who are fascinated as they watch me make items for them to wear."
2,not even smell like henna,"I have been using henna for my hair almost for 15 years.this is the worst henna i have ever used.Normally when you mix henna with water it smells sharp henna smell,and if you touch it with your fingers it would stain for weeks.This is why we use henna in our culture to color hands,feet,hair.specially at weddings as part of the celebration.This one didn't even stain a bit on my fingers while i was coloring my hair.my hair turned little bit red color that was it.Good henna should stain very dark red soon as you put your fingers in and stay like that for weeks.this one by far the worst quality henna i have ever used.I will import my henna next time."
4,Great sound,"This Meinl Shakers are great for acoustic recording and have a great full sound, are exteremly loud which is good also for stage performances. Really like them and would recommend them to any percussionist that enjoys rhythmic sounds."
3,fair show,"Depending on what era of the WWF you like best, this is a show worth watching - but maybe not buying. As far as Summer Slam's go, Summer Slam 92 from London would have to be the best. I would rate this in the top 7 Summer Slams...but not the best. Changing the main event to a 3-way took away from what could have been a great contest btw. Triple H and Austin."
3,"Good, worth the money at least","Well this PPV was pretty good. But the undercard beat the main event. A triple threat for the WWF title refereed by Jesse Ventura and had Triple H , Mankind, and Stone Cold. Sounds good? It wasn't really, it had its moments (HHH SLAMMING a steel chair on Stone Cold's knee while on the apron). But all through it you are scratching your head saying How did thta happen and whatnot. The Test/Mcmahon was by far the best match. The worst part of this is that it is the last REAL match Stone Cold was able to perform at until his departure in late '99. His match at No Mercy 99 was very good, but it lacked the real 'Stone Cold' attitude he so very well portrays. If you can get it for under 16.99, then buy it."
2,"WWF SummerSlam 1999: ""An Out of Body Experience"" Review","This was a very disappointing pay per view. The undercard really sucked and the main event pretty much sucked too. Who would have thought that Mankind could beat Steve Austin with a Double Arm DDT. I'm not saying he was an unworthy champion, but a Double Arm DDT? Plus, the Jesse Ventura factor didn't play as big a part as it should have. The reason this video gets a two is for the ""Love Her or Leave Her"" match between Shane and Test. I never would have guessed that would have been the best match at a SummerSlam! Don't buy this video unless you want to see a real disappointing event considering all the hype. DON'T BUY THE VIDEO!"

5,a longtime fan's review,i did thoroughly enjoy watching this dvd and i would definitely recommend if u are a diehard wwe fan and remember when wwe was at its peak and HHH started to come into his own.....AWESOME.
2,A Disappointing Release,"Back in the `60s, Sam Lay was the drummer in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. These days, he has his own aggregation, for which he drums and sings. Judging from this recording, however, these guys seem to be just going through the motions. The music sounds formulaic (this can often happen with the blues genre, but this is a fairly glaring example), Lay's voice does not seem very expressive, and even his drumming does not seem particularly noteworthy. Maybe these guys put on a good live show, but blues fans will probably want to pass on this recording. Even the sound quality is a letdown--OK but nothing special. Overall, then, this recording is quite a disappointment."
3,Not so much for the older fans,"So I'm a big fan of Full Metal Panic and I've watched a number of other mecha anime. So I googled to try to find which mecha anime was highest rated among fans and this title came up.Well I was a little disappointed. Its not a bad anime, but it's not what I was looking for. I think maybe if I was a lot younger (currently 31) then I would have loved it."
3,straps need to be snugger; otherwise comfortable,"I owned a pair of jamie pumps for years. this is by the same company and appeared similar with the straps that cross over the foot. But while those have a snug fit, these are too loose over the foot. As the rest if the shoe fits well, though, I opted to keep my pair."
4,Great Book filled with facts...,"This was a great book. I really enjoyed it very much, however I wish they would talk about Albert. Overall I gave this book 4 stars because it is so hard to put down. Great story of a baseball player acheiving his goal."
4,Albert Puhols Story Review,"I found this book to be interesting, and would recommend it to any baseball fan."
2,Not the best.,These fall off. Perhaps I'm not clear on how to prevent that...but I'm not loving it. I prefer the brand the gym has available for subs. I'm actually going to have to sew this at the closure. Yuck. Too much work.
4,Delivery was prompt,The belt was recived promptly and seemed sturdy though the buckles come out and aren't very solid.
1,The size of the belt has changed!,"I've been using this belt for several years as an instructor and have been very happy with the way it fits, adjusts to your body and holds mic. But I just ordered 4 in one shot a few weeks ago and it's now being made SMALLER! I have not gained weight - on the contrary! Now it fits snug, barely have any way to make it looser! I loved that I was able to wear it below the waistline and now it can't - I have to place it right on my waist so that it fits. My waist is 28 - so hopefully that helps you decide on fitting."
3,Tunebelt,"I purchased 4 of these for our fitness program instructors. I've had a few complaints that the belts aren't big enough and fit pretty snug. Also, they don't adjust very easily and end up falling apart. However, I've only found 1 really good microphone belt and this one will do for the money that we paid."
1,Good men do not do bad things.,"We are judged by our actions. If we do bad things, then we are bad people. Good men do not behave badly. Good people do not lie or cheat or betray. If a good man can behave badly, how do we describe a man who is honorable, honest, faithful, just and true? If the author wrote a true book, a book which says ""Shame on you! No one participated in your decision to lie, cheat, betray or steal, you have chosen to be a bad person; knock it off!"" it would be a true book, but no one would buy it."
1,Why Psychologists behave badly and write bad books,"Myself and my long time girlfriend went to David Wexler for counseling because we were having some problems in our relationship, and he was highly recommended. Our first session was very contentious and his main concern was how we were going to pay for his services. He represented himself as an expert in counseling couples in conflict, but after several sessions, he refused to council us together, only separately. This was not our agreement, but Wexler was still only too happy to keep the significant amount we had paid him, despite his refusal to continue with our original agreement. I took him to small claims court, won my case, and recovered a decent amount of the money I had paid him. My recommendation would be to avoid working with David Wexler. He has no problem violating any agreement he makes with you, changing the rules as he sees fit, whether you agree or not, and I have court documents to prove it."
4,Surprisingly lightweight,"I've used a number of different brands of NIMH rechargeables over the last five years, and these are the most lightweight of them all. With these being a generic brand, I thought maybe I had gotten ripped off. They feel like they might be AAA batteries enclosed in a AA case. One cell weighs about half the amount of a major-brand AA NIMH cell.The first charge cycle was quite short. I only got around 50 or so shots from the first charge. Thinking maybe these batteries needed ""warming up,"" I recharged them, discharged them using my camera's battery discharge mode, then repeated once more. They seem to be lasting longer at this point. We'll see how they perform in the long run."
2,not what it presents itself to be,"What is it with mandolin books, that they seem to be the most misleadingly titled music books out there?You might think from the title that this one lays out all the harmonizing, fingering strategies, and melodic extrapolation you're gonna need if you want to adapt fiddle tunes to mandolin playing.No, nothing like that. It's just an anthology of fiddle tunes for the mandolin, with some advice on playing thrown in. But all of the ""fleshing out"" -- if you will -- has been done for you: this book certainly doesn't teach you how to do it, as I suggest the name implies.As for being an anthology of fiddle tunes, however, it's just fine, though I think this one is much more impressive:Mel Bay's Fiddle Tunes and Irish Music for Mandolin."
5,Just had to have this,I saw this one day while I was goofing around and just had to have it. I want Charles Dickens next. This is a cool little figure with a quill and book. The quill falls out of his hand and could very easily be lost. It is also tiny. Not great for small children. He sits on my book case and inspires me.
1,little of note here,There is nothing in this book but wild accusations based on conspiracy theories. I was hoping for a more serious work. Avoid this one.
2,Desperate hours,the title was not as it stated this was the soundtrack only not the movie. We are still in middle of straightenin g this out
3,Completely wrong for the movie,"Just wanted to say that I have never in my life heard less-appropriate music in a movie. This is 70's style sweeping orchestral nature-movie music, pasted into a suspenseful drama. A bad guy, covered in blood, holding a pistol is about to get shot while standing in the middle of a canyon river...and the music is a cheesy instrumental of ""red river valley""? Yeah, that makes sense. Another example: while a guy is dragging a body through the same river, cue up the happy playful-puppy music.Imagine ""Saw"" scored by John Williams, and you'll get the idea."
2,Not Ready for prime time,"Debbie Davies would be a good act at the neighborhood bar, but she just isn't prime time material for the national scene. Neither her vocals or guitar playing are top drawer in my opinion. Anybody that likes this kind of music ought to listen to Shannon Curfman who IS the real deal."
4,Miss Davies!,"If you love blues music, then playing in Albert Collins' band counts for something in my book. I feel it is her best music yet, and she really seems comfortable with the well chosen material. Two other recent collaborations are ""Homesick For The Road"", with Tab Benoit and Kenny Neal and ""Grand Union"", with Otis Grand and Anson Funderburgh. Having listened to a radio interview of hers, I think her music on this CD shows her dedication and love for that which she has paid some dues."
2,Mechanical Sweet Studio Guitar Work,"Boy am I disappointed! Proof positive of the error of letting the artist co-produce her own record. I can just hear the guys in the studio saying ""Now Debs, lets do the guitar track just one more time (yeah like about take 753) It comes off as too studio perfect, and frankly sickly. You never get the impression that somethings about to happen, that she's gonna cut loose and surprise us with a little energy.This lady has a great voice! and the songs mostly click but I needed to hear a hell of a lot more real emotion. Patti Rousou? and Ellen Foley who backed Meatloaf, had that kind of raw voice power and pent up emotion that blasted through. Don't waste your time with this unless you like sweet background muzik masquerading as blues!I can however, recommend the other album that I bought at the same time ""Picture This"" see the review."
3,Careful with the heatsink,"This is a great processor for the money. As many other reviewers have stated, it is easy to overclock this baby. There is a problem though, and that's why I gave it only three stars.I had a little heat problem at first, and since a lot of reviews seemed to indicate this processor runs fairly cool, I figured that I must of messed something up. After looking around on line I discovered that its fairly common to not get all four of the heatsink clips in to the mobo. After reading this I went around each of the clips in sequence about three or four times and sure enough one of them popped in a little more.It is highly recommended that you install this CPU and its heatsink before putting the mobo in to the case, as you can then visually confirm that the clips are all securely in place."
5,Intel is Intel,"Is an Intel product, no more to say. Intel is synonymous of QUALITY. the only bad thing is that you need to install another cooling cpu fan, believe me and dont install the stock cooling fan, i change my Computer every year and all the intels oem cooling fans don't have the quality to manage the heat of the cpu in the all performance i need. Actually i install a Zalman cooling fan and can overclock the cpu to 2.70 Ghz."
5,Great performance for the price,"If you're looking for a CPU with great overclocking potential, take a very close look at the E6400. With a decent motherboard that allows overclocking functions, anyone with a basic understanding of tweaking the BIOS can take the E6400 from 2.13GHz to 3.2Ghz on stock air cooling.I've paired the processor with a Gigabyte DS3 motherboard, and on air cooling, I'm able to hit 3.2Ghz running dual Prime95 instances at 2+ hours with no instability issues whatsoever. At these speeds, I'm able to run Super Pi tests as follows: 18s 1M, 43s 2M, 1m43s 4M, 17m19s 32M."
5,great!,"for the price this little chip has been awesome. and the heatsink is a breeze to put on compared to old ones I've put on before, no fear of putting a screwdrive though your brand new Mboard."
1,Weave me the Sunshine,"I should have listened to more samples from this album, was very disappointed in the songs and their lack of quality. I generally like PP&M but won't listen to this one again."
4,Lots of fun!!!,"We purchased this product for a 6 year old who asked for a remote controlled airplane. The first launch was less than spectacular but once we re-read the directions and corrected the charging time, the next flight took off and went all over the yard. Our nephew squealed with delight and claimed this was the coolest thing he ever seen. You need LOTS of open space when using it though. A small backyard with trees won't do. Take it to a school yard or other large field.One problem with this particular model is the color. It easily gets lost so we had to buy a couple of replacements. It needs some neon stripping or something to help find it in the grass. We're afraid to add anything that would throw off the balance and ability to stay in flight.Otherwise, this is a great toy - enjoyed by the kids and adults."
4,Fun times,"I bought this for my 4 year old son and he loves it. Be warned - if there's any kind of breeze you may wish to wait until you get to a big field or park before you launch this plane! My husband and son launched it in our front yard and it swirled around for a good 3 minutes 50 ft in the air, threatening to land on any number of neighborhood rooftops! Loads of fun, recommend this."
3,not what i expected,it wasnt exactly what i expected. i thought i was going to see a bit more stripping but it was more talking than anything.
5,Dokken rocks with Reb on guitar,"When George departed again I wasn't sure who'd fill his shoes. Upon hearing the CD ""Erase the Slate"", I knew Reb was up for the challenge. In addition to ""Erase the Slate"" the songs ""Maddest Hatter"" and ""Voice of the Soul"" feature some angry growls & crazy squeals from Rebs guitar...Even when it's kicked down with the ballads ""In Your Honour"" and ""Who Believes"" the guitar solos are powerful. The songs are catchy too and include a cover version of ""One"". This CD rocks with the best of them. I've got every Dokken CD and this one is my favorite hands down.The Japanese import includes the songs ""Sign of the Times"" & ""Upon Your Lips"" which are absent from the US release.Also, check out the ""Live From the Sun"" CD & DVD."
3,Mainly NFL seasons in review during the Oakland wins,"This 2 DVD set was a real disappointment. The Raiders, a team that I dearly love, may have had a few more seconds of coverage than any of the other teams that played football during the year of the Oakland Raider Super Bowl wins. To make it short and to the point, this DVD set is not for the Oakland Raider fan."
4,Romantic Adulthood Delusions,"This rather psychotic than physiological work is of a young same-sex attracted man attending sister's wedding at a family place where as a fat teen he was physically and emotionally abused by father-gardener to date still trapped with shadows of delusive son's adulthood.A romantic tale of family woes, sexual explorations, dementia and AIDS-awareness."
4,"Dark, sad and understandable",The film quality was good as was the audio. The actors did a good job and the story was strange but something connects with a great many who will see it. I related well with the film and was drawn into some parts deeply. I feel it was a good investment.
4,Holds the interest,"This film is a strange, sad film about a young gay man and his miserable family. It reaches a point of crisis at his sister's wedding. There are tragic, believeable characters: the alcoholic father who can't control his temper, the burned-out mother worn down from keeping the family together, the daffy grandmother, the brassy, devoted sister, her indecisive, mixed-up husband. But for all that, we always remain fixated on the main character, both as despairing, lonely teenager and quietly self-assured young man. Some scenes grab the emotions like few other films have, especially for gay men struggling with unhappy childhoods. The only problem is that it's sometimes hard to understand. The director strives to be artistic, which is admirable, but the mixing of realistic melodrama and surrealism results in uncertainty, and when the film is over, I was uncertain as to what the director was trying to say. However, it is always gripping and holds the attention."
2,Boringggggggggggggg.,I really tried watching this 3 times. Each time I could not finish. I found it so boringggg! It dragged on and really never seemed to keep my interest.
1,Absolute Amateur Poo-Poo,"Stultifyingly boring hack-job. Grossly manipulative. Obvious to the extreme. Laughably predictable. Void of talent. The whole film looks as if it was pieced together from the outtakes of various dysfunctional-family morning talk-shows with bottom-of-the-barrel Felliniesque symbolisms thrown in to make the entire project seem ""artful."" I don't think I've seen a more amateurish piece of work in years. A real symptom of the growing degeneration of modern independent film-making. The moral: Just because you CAN put a film camera in the hands of an emotionally complicated wanna-be these days...it doesn't mean you SHOULD."
5,Not what I expected,"I love Alex and all of his works, this is by far my favorite. This was not at all what I expected but much much more."
2,THEY ARE NOT GREY,"WATCH OUT FOR THE COLOR, THEY ARE NOT GREY BUT SKYBLUE SO THEY ARE NOT SO COMBINABLE AS YOU WISH. OTHERWISE VERY COMFY,NOT THAT STILISH BUT COMFY."
2,"Not fitting, so to speak","The size medium was very, very small; it would not even go on. I suspect that the sizing on this product simply runs smaller than one would think. I returned the item, asking for a larger size in exchange, but instead was notified that this was a return and the charge was removed from my credit card. I'm not unhappy about that; I can look for a cami somewhere else, but the experience was somewhat odd. The item looked OK. Of course I have no idea how it would wear. If it looks like something you would like, I would caution you to order a size up.Cuddl Duds Square Neck Camisole"
3,Cuddly & Stylish,"I have really enjoyed this item. It's so cuddly and warm - and very stylish to wear with the lace peeking out from under V-neck tops. Unfortunately, the body of the camisole has not held it's color well - it began to fade very quickly, and that was with using cold water wash. Too bad. Probably won't ever order it again but have enjoyed it while the good times lasted."
3,Van Fleet a unheralded general,"Not a great biography. Some parts are too complimentary. In other sections, data is just missing.But James Van Fleet was quite a man. Born poor in rural Florida he ultimately became a four star general. Early on as a ROTC instructor in Florida he held the record as a record-setting football coach. He could inspire people.General George Marshall referred to him as ""the most aggressive and hard driving Corps commander."" General Patton, no military slouch said he was ""a fighting fool."" Admired by virtually everyone, his definitive biography is yet to come.This book is crisply written and provides insight into the Second World War and the Cold War as well."
5,Classic Period Piece,"In my opinion this should surely go down as one of the great classic period pieces. I loved this mini series. It is well rounded with true to life conflicts. It deals with relationships between parents & children, siblings, friendships, trust, strengths, weekness and of course love. It does not contain a lot of mushie gushie romance, so I can't classify it as only a chick flick, I believe men will enjoy it too. The only thing I would have different is the last look on the leading lady's face. I'm not giving anything away, it is a must see if you like period piece films..."
5,Stunningly Romantic!... (swoon),"I ordered this series a couple weeks back, as I was in the mood for good period romance. I had worn out my copy of P&P (Firth/Ehle version). I could not have known how greatly N&S would surpass my expectations. This is my absolute favorite series and yes I love it more than P&P! (sigh) This series has so much substance, so much heart, so much realism. I found myself smiling when the characters smiled, crying when they cried and absolutely swooning over Mr. Thornton. *grin* The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful. I've had the DVD less than a week and I've already watched it twice. Now I am on the hunt for another period romance/drama that could at least halfway fill the shoes of N&S. (sigh) But I'm afraid N&S has ruined me for all other period dramas."
5,Most Romantic,I have watched this several times and shown it to family and friends. THey truly loved it. It is so romantic and beautiful. You won't be disappointed...
4,Another great BBC series !,"I love Elizabeth Gaskell's ""Wives & Daughters"" so much that I just had to try this mini-series also based on one of her novels. It didn't disappoint me -- I cannot honestly put it up there with Wives ... only Pride & Prejudice can go on that shelf ... but it sure runs a close second! The very first hour of the series had me alittle skeptical and semi-hooked, but then it got really intriguing and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series! The tension between the two main characters reminded me so much of Pride & Prejudice ... I just loved it. If you're a fan of either of those aforementioned series, you will love this one too ... maybe not as much, but it's well worth your time to watch & find out!"
4,One of my favorites,I have loved this mini-series since the first time I saw it. If you like period dramas you'll enjoy this.
3,North & South,"I like period dramas. The acting was okay but there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the leads. As the story progressed it improved somewhat, but I wish I had rented it first."
5,Love the story,"Great story, DVD is good quality. . .wonderful romantic and well told story. If you liked P&P with Colin Firth, this is right up your ally."
5,Highly Recommended!,"I bought this movie sight unseen which is something I never do but I had read so many glowing reviews, at more than one site, so I took a chance. It's the best movie I've seen since the 1995 version of Pride & Prejudice. Richard Armitage gave the best performance I've had the priviledge of seeing as Mr. Thornton though all the performances were wonderful. I enjoyed all the scenes Thornton had with his mother as well as the union leader, Higgins, but it is his love of Margaret Hale that drives the story. The last scene is the most romantic scene I've ever seen on film. I highly recommend this movie - you won't be sorry."
5,North and South,The movie is wonderful about an England mill town.Gives great insight into how people lived back then.The service was fast without problems.
4,Give this mini-seires a chance,"I had never heard of Elizabeth Gaskell, but now I want to read everything she has ever written. This BBC mini-series is wonderful. Richard Armitage is absolutely amazing as John Thornton. He plays brooding and tortured better than anyone. Some might try to compare him to Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy, but I think Richard showed a little deeper of an inner turmoil. All the performances are great. I started watching this at 10:00 at night and stayed up until 2:00 in the morning to finish it. It may not be as well known as Pride & Prejudice, but it is definitely worth checking out."
5,Great Romance Movie,"I love this movie. It is very long but I watch it over and over! Clean, family freindly, very well put together! So Happy to have it!"
5,North & South,"One of the best Period movies I have ever watched. After viewing several trailers of this movie on You Tube, I could hardly wait until my copy of it arrived. And when it did, I was not in the least disappointed. It should become a Classic."
3,Looks good,"Have not completely seen it yet, but I loved Wives and Daughters so I purchased this film due to the excellent author. I will do a more intense review later, so far it looks very good. Not as fancy as Wives and Daughters, you know us ladies love the period films for their lovely gowns, countryside and sweet romances. I also like Charles Dickens so I go from one to another. Thanks"
2,North & South,I bought this DVD after reading the reviews from other buyers. I own several other movies and thought to add it to my collection. I have to say I struggled to watch this movie and was greatly disappointed. It is very dark and depressing. I could watch the news on TV if I wanted to be depressed. Even the clothes of the characters is dark. Plus I had a difficult time understanding some of the characters speech and what was going on. This movie is was not what I expected at all
5,Fantastic!,"North and South is a classic. As others have said, it's right up there with Pride and Prejudice. Fantastic screenplay and wonderful acting along with rich historical details and locations make this a delight to watch. The accents are accurate (bad accents are a real pet peeve for me) making the characters more believable. The romance is subtle except for the somewhat ""modern"" ending, but really, would modern viewers be satisfied with an accurate 1850's ending? This film is as historically true as possible while still being entertaining and romantic. Love it!"
5,Wow...,"This is one of the best, if not THE best mini-series I've ever watched. I watched all four episodes without a break. The cast was perfect. The whole thing was perfection. I didn't want it to end. There are many, many other reviews on here already, and I really can't add anything new except another FIVE STARS."
5,Wonderful!,I absolutely LOVED this movie. Not since Sense & Sensibility came out in 1995 have a loved a period piece so much.
5,A great way to spend 4 hours.,"For being period drama, this film adaptation more than any I've seen has something for everyone. The backdrop of worker reform the love story is set against brings so many things to the movie that make it hard to call North and South a love story.North & South has something for everyone, rioting, suicide, murder mystery, worker unionizing and against all that, more marriage proposals and refusals, May-December romances, and some very funny comic relief in the character of Fanny Thornton."
5,Best One Yet!!!,I had read about North & South for some time but I did not think it would be my cup of tea but it is by far my favorite movie now. The acting is top notch and the story is excellent. What chemistry the two main actors have! Just can't say enough good things about it. I had never seen Richard Armitage in anything before now I want to see everything he has been in. He is an excellent actor! I also want to read the book now. Daniella Denby-Ashe as Margaret was wonderful! Buy it! You won't regrete it!!
5,Wonderful,"People say that movies never do the book justice. I wouldn't know in this case. I do know, however, I am hesitant to read the book in fear that it will not do the movie justice. It is that good."
5,Superb!,"Unlike many BBC productions, North and South, based on the Elizabeth Gaskell novel, did not air in the United States. However, thankfully it has been released on DVD to garner American fans.North and South tells the story of two people, Margaret Hale, a sheltered young woman from the south of England; and Mr. Thornton, a mill-owner in the industrial North. Not just a love story, North and South shows the conditions and struggles both workers and dwellers during the Industrial Age had to endure.The production is truly superb. There is wonderful acting from period-drama newcomer Daniela Denby-Ashe, but Richard Armitage gives a stand out performance as the brooding Mr. Thornton; viewers will be hard pressed not to fall in love with him after this.Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South rates among the top of costume dramas. Bravo!"
5,Loved it!!!,"I have to agree with so many other reviewers - this one is up there with 1995 P&P. Casting, production and adaptation are superb. While the film does not follow the book exactly, I find the changes to fit in with the story. BUT although I loved the final scene, I wish they would have followed the book there, as I adore the final scene in the book. I strongly recommend reading the book as well. Mr. Thornton has now joined Mr. Darcy as my all time fav fictional leading man that I encourage my husband to follow as an example in any way possible :)"
5,Industrial drab setting makes for fiery and captivating story,"This BBC drama is set in drab industrial London; one would think the movie would be just as slow/dreary - but NOT the case!The lead male is magnetic in his somber yet fiery portayl of the mill ""master""... a British Hugh Jackman if you will. The heroine is truly a heroine - and I love that she is not a waif, but a new face, in which she brings her role spirit and courage. And the mother - has the most captivating accent and dark demeanor.North & South entrenches you in it's dark times of cotton mill industrialism, but uplifts you to see the romance and hope for the common man by the finish. The town's turmoil and unlikely romance make for a fantastic film!"
5,LOVE IT,"this movie was AMAZING.. it was very beautiful.. a must see for romantics! It made me feel all ""mushy"" inside."
5,I recommend owning this one.,"I enjoyed this BBC movie version much more than the book. Richard Armitage was stellar as Mr. Thornton. And, something unusual in a romance, his interactions with supporting characters were as interesting as those with the heroine. Acting, directing, filming all very good. Some beautiful and authentic cinematography of cotton floating through the air in the working mill scenes, the green paradise of Helstone, and the bustling manufacturing town of Milton. If there are any flaws, I would say they consist of some overly long strike speeches, and to some extent the heroine herself. She's a strong-willed character but not always likable, and the voice of the actress was a bit annoying at times. The ending train scene, in spite of being too far ahead of the time period, was so moving that it now makes the list as one of my favorite screen moments."
3,North South,"A good movie in seeing and understand the industrial development in England/Scotland during the 1800's. Gives insight to effects on people. Starts and moves a bit slow and is predictable, but I'm a guy. My daughter absolutely loved the movie."
1,North and South,"I was so very disappointed in this purchase. I would advise every American not to purchase this DVD as it will only play in Region 2, which means it will not play in Region 1 - The United States of America. How ridiculous is that. This purchase cost me $9.00 with shipping and to send it back was another $4.00 plus, so it was a total loss to me. I would highly recommend not buying this product unless you live in the UK or Australia which is ""Region 2."""
2,dull,"I am a huge fan of British historical dramas and was disappointed. I read a few reviews that compared it to Pride & Prejudice -and how that our male hero Mr. Thornton was akin to Mr. Darcy. I found the story went no where and it showed the dark side of the Victorian era - If you do get it, just do not expect to see grand dresses and beautiful scenery. This is not going to show that.Boo."
2,Hmmm...,"I must be the dissenting voice here. I love a good British drama, but was disappointed here. I found it melodramatic and terribly predictable, a wanna be Pride and Prejudice with a dollop of Heathcliff thrown in. And it felt far too modern in some specific scenes- does the book have it's protagonists passionately kissing in the train station at it's conclusion? I wonder. Maybe it's a generational thing, but give me the old Masterpiece Theater productions, which to me feel much truer to the time."
3,North? South?,"It was a ""nice"" story - certainly not a great one. If I had missed an installment, well - se la vie.I knew who were the good guys and who were the not so good, as well as knowing how it would end long before the characters knew. However, I still don't understand why the emphasis on the title was as it was. It really wasn't that important. It was a family that had moved from one part of England to another - as simple as that.As I said before, it was a nice story, but not much more."
2,"North & South, skipping already","This movie is great! However, after watching it only 2 or 3 times, the disc is skipping already. I am disappointed that the product would start malfunctioning so early."
5,Loved it!,"I ran across this movie while searching movies on Netflix. I thought it was the ""other"" North and South. What can I say...I LOVED IT! I knew nothing about the story line, etc. and I was completely sucked in from the beginning. I highly recommend this movie...I never stay up late, and I literally could not turn the tv off. Watched all four episodes in one sitting..very very good!"
5,Best Period Drama,"I saw this movie for the first time last week and purchased it today because I loved it so much. I love the story and the acting is very good. I have seen many period dramas such P&P, S&S, Emma, etc. and this one is by far the best I've seen."
5,Surprised,"On recommendation of my daughter I purchased this film. It is something akin to Pride and Prejudice. It jumps right into the soup of life with the characters and situations surrounding them. The acting is superb, setting you up to dislike the ""villan"" in the beginning...and then warming to them. The heartwrenching nature of living life like a slave in textile mills was brought home by getting to ""know"" them.It was long enough to become fully engaged in story and characters lives. By the end I knew I need to watch the ending a second time. It is a new family favorite."
5,True love triumphs,"I'm not going to go into a lengthy review here. I just have to say that the proof is in the pudding. I stayed up, through the night, until dawn to watch the entire series. It was that engrossing. It's superbly cast and acted. It was the first time I had seen Richard Armitage in anything. He was fantastic as John Thornton. Since my initial viewing of North and South, I must have watched it in it's entirety about 15 times. It will be a lifetime favorite."
4,Good show but not as good as the book...,"While the book was a little slow in the beginning the story was so well thought out and developed that the shortcuts taken in the movie were very noticeable. While it was still a good story the book was full of details even to the dialect spoken in the North. The liberties that were taken for the movie somewhat diminshed the story for me, I hate when that happens."
5,It's the best bonnet film out there,Great performance of all the actors involved. My wife and I love watching it together. Brilliant story - that's key with any movie. This film is the best kept secret out there.
5,Fantastic...a must in your collection!,"Buy it, buy it, buy it. I can only praise this video, it's a fantastic adaptation of the book. I read the book first, which I believe is a must to enhance the enjoyment of this movie. Great novel. RICHARD ARMITAGE was PERFECT as Mr. Thorton. You won't regret it...money well spent. He's a great, fantastic actor...he should be doing more of this! Don't miss him in Spooks (MI5) and Chris Ryan's Strike Back aired in the UK."
5,Terrific !,"Even though this mini-series takes some liberties in adapting E. Gaskel's original narration , it is done with amazing sensitivityand does not essentially alter the story-line. The casting and acting is superb . I can't think of a better BBC production . This isbetter than any of the J. Austen mini-series . I just loved it and consider North and South almost a work of art : you never tire of it . - But , just like the book , I wish the final scenes had been a better match for the rest of the production . Elizabeth Gaskel had a valid excuse for the sudden ending of her story , the author of this screenplay did not , and took the easy way out . Still ,I loved it and know that I will watch it many more times."
4,Interesting Story,"Very interesting story with good characters. Good subject matter. The voice of the mother was sometimes too quiet and it was difficult to understand her at times but, all in all, not enough to take away from the stories interest and enjoyment. This story was interesting to me from a historical stand point (men able to earn their wealth through industry), and from a social standpoint (the vast differences between southern and northern culture). Very believable acting for the most part."
2,as if she'd turn him down...,"Puleeze, like she wouldn't sign on to have his hand sitting in that little English cotton town.All I can say is he can run my mill any time."
3,Most romantic of all,"This is by far my favorite together with Pride and Prejudice. I can't imagine why I took so long to see it but I have fallen in love with Elizabeth Gaskell's novels. It is beautifully made, intriguing, full of humanity and ever so romantic."
5,It's a Tough Life Up North,"With a twisting and complicated plot, North and South gives us an excellent look at the industrial north in Victorian England. It is an intricate web of lives that depend on rough trade and manufactoring in a time when gentle manners and moral standing were vital in society. The setting is as dark and brooding as Richard Armitage's John Thornton, who is a close contender for the next Mr Darcy. The tension between him and Margaret Hale is tight with intellect and sexuality while giving us passionate social comment on the strain of such a suppressive culture. It is a faithful rendition of the novel."
5,Yeah Richard Armitage!,I love this film! Richard Armitage is great in it. It is such a shame that he is not in more films.This rendition of Elizabeth Gaskell's book of the same title shows one woman's struggle to understand the vast differences between life in the north and south of England. Her struggle to overcome her conflicting feelings about Mr. Thornton are very similar to Elizabeth Bennett's struggle to finally know and understand Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. If you like period films and enjoy the suspense of wondering if two people will ever end up together then you will love this film.
5,Review,The story line was very interesting and the actors did a good job. I guess after watching Downton Abbey everything pales in comparison but it was still good.
5,My favorite book turned into a great DVD...,"It is very hard to ever be satisfied with film versions of a book you love, and have re-read so many times over the years. Of course I had pictured every face and place differently. I agree that Thornton was cast perfectly. This adaptation stayed true to the book, except for the ending scene. I do prefer the book's - more subtle, but more intense at the same time.The story is very similar to Pride and Prejudice, except she seems to have all the pride and the prejudice. However, it tells so much more about what was going on at the time and has a good storyline going on with other characters. I would call this more of a historical fiction, as it tells about the industry and strikes, and P&P; (which I do love, as well)more of a classical romance story."
5,Just discovered classic,"This dvd is now on my ""classic movie shelf"" along with the BBC Jane Austin dvd collections. I love this movie and I couldn't help but read the book which was excellent also."
5,"BBC ""North & South"" with Daneila Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage",Read the book by Elizabeth Gaskell and watch this miniseries. Or watch the miniseries and then read the book. Perhaps the latter is better since you can visualize Denby-Ashe and Armitage whilst reading.
5,what a great mini series!!!!,"very very nicely done! dark, depressed, stressful, gloomy and almost hopeless but at the same time, lovely, strong-heart, strong-opinion ones that ever been created by a female author."
5,Fabulous,"Thanks Amazon. Everything was in perfect shape. Movie works and looks great. 5 stars. Would like shipping to be cheaper. However, I feel it was a great buy for not finding the movie on any other website for a cheaper price."
4,sad.....but good,"great movie. so romantic. really sweet story. it is rather sad with several deaths occurring during the course of the movie. that said, the story does not revolve around sadness. very clean too. armatage makes a great main charater as does the actress who play marget. 10 times better than cranford (a movie based on another novel by gaskell)."
5,great period drama,"If you're a P&P; fan, a Darcy fanatic or a period piece aficionado....I recommend watching this splendid BBC series. It is much darker in tone and content than P&P;, taking on subject matter such as unionization and unfair wage practices, but this provides for some of the greatest drama and social commentary.You'll find the lead characters engaging and the love story compelling. It hooked me from the start. I bought this dvd without prior viewing and was not disappointed. I don't think you'll be either."
5,Smouldering Passion!,"I can't recomment this series highly enough! Not only did I learn a lot about industrial England and the running of cotton mills, but it also touches on the sad lives of the poor people who had to labour in them. The film also highlights the incredible differences in class structure in English society of that time. The relationship between John Thornton and Margaret Hale smoulders with sexual tension throughout. Richard Armitage plays the role of a lifetime reminiscent of Colin Firth's, Mr. Darcy."
4,An enjoyable movie,"I got this movie for my wife. It's a BBC film split into four one hour episodes. I watched it with her and was impressed with the depth and complexity of the characters. It had believable acting and a good story. It was a very enjoyable film. As long as you don't mind movies that require patience, it is great. If you are a fan of any of the Jane Austin movies you will probably like this one as well."
5,Excellent movie,"This is such a great movie on so many levels. I love Jane Austen and all, but this story has more than just the strivings of the few who really matter to the story. The ""background"" characters hold their own and you are just as interested in them as the main characters. There is also quite a bit about unions and working conditions in this day and age of industrial revolution. No, it is not Marxist, it is ""Smithist"" in it's portrayal of masters and workers. Bottom line: it's four hours of pure enjoyment. Great movie, great cast, great music, great everything. Fanny is my favorite portrayal, but everyone does an excellent job."
5,Amazing,"I saw this randomly on A&E or BBC or something a few years ago, and when I was bored searching on Amazon i was so excited to see it. It really is one of my favorite purchases ever, the best movie to snuggle into at night or on a lazy day."
2,shipping takes forever,i placed an order on the 5th of april. it is now april 22 and still no order. shipping takes forever. so if you are in no hurry then i guess it is ok.i will never buy from them again !!!!!
2,"okay, but overpriced","this is a very good book for introducing body/mind health issues. it covers a lot of territory. only thing is, is the references. the references used in this book are mostly from ""pop"" magazines such as psychology today, time, u.s. world, readers digest (!), etc. i personally do not consider these publications too legit, but that is my opinion. i got this book through the local library, i would recommend you do the same to see if you want to shell out the big bucks. or get it used, there are a lot of copies for sale."
4,Good Read!,This book has so much information about leading a healthy lifestyle. It gave me so much information about what to look for in clients who need to make changes in their life.
2,THIS IS NOT MIKE HAMMER'S MICKEY SPILLANE,"Unfortunately,this is not a good book. For those of us who are long time Mickey Spillane fans, it is a major disappointmnet. That hard, crudely eloquent writing is missing. The tough guy main character is not an angry, slow moving guided missile, seeking his target and smacking down anyone who gets in his way.The tough guy in this book spends all his time drinking beer and dropping hints that he used to be a vengeful guided missile. The story is flat. The pacing is slow. The characters are just not very interesting. Spillane has a new Mike Hammer novel coming out in the summer of '04. Let's hope he is back to his old form for that one. He missed badly with ""Something's Down There."""
3,Maybe it's me?,"I'm not sure that this is a novel for diehard fans, since it lacks the clear, lean narrative that usually characterizes this master's works. There are too many characters, too many vague plot lines, too much texture, too much technical detail. There is not enough grit, not enough action, not enough memorable one-liners.In short, it's not your usual Mickey Spillane book. Here, he's doing things that others do much better rather than doing the things that no one can do like him. For a weathered, government operative with old values and old expressions, go for a Donald Hamilton, who can also do boats and action at sea.Maybe it's just me. This is a guy who always deserves the benefit of the doubt. Keep writing, Mickey."
3,Is this his last book ??,He died in 2006 at 88; this was published in 2004 - maybe this is his last book?
2,MEDIOCRE MASTERING...,"Tenaglia, once again, delivers one hell of a powerhouse and unique GU mix. However, the final mix/mastering of this compilation is nothing short of atrocious!WHO was at the helm during the final mastering of this 2 CD set? The overall sound levels are beneath standard. The highs and lows are nearly INAUDIBLE... While (attempting) to LISTEN to this mix, I find myself turning the volume up again and again!The guys at GU should (and do) know better... Perhaps they should have waited a few days AFTER this GU party before attempting to committ their technical (?) skills to this sub-par mix. The track selection and mixing of Tenaglia's set are terribly marred by mediocre mastering. What a shame..."
2,I would't go there if I were you...,"Maybe Danny didn't have the copyrights to spin real records on this album, I don't know, but it's just background music. The first half starts out alright, sounding vaguely tropical and new-yorican, lifting a style from NY Club Body and Soul. And there are some clever samples...but they never go anywhere. If you want vocals, there are NONE except a bad remix of Keep in Touch Body-to-Body. I happen to like vocal-less techno house, but this doesn't cut it. The second CD is much worse. This is soulless Danny being heavily marketed to new-school clubbies tweaking under headphones with no history to ground them."
2,hmmmm.well I don't know about these reviews,usually GU offers the best in DJs and house music...this one man I got to pass..too slow...sounds like a slower version of Oakenfold or Digweed. God it was hard to listen to each track....christ...I also got the Athens GU 10 hoping he would deliever... he didn't... so their ya go
4,1st disc house 2nd disc louse,"this review is in part review and in part response to christian c. (another reviewer of this disc). disc 1 is soulful and danny driving funk toward the second half (w/o losing the soul) but it is not accurate to say that danny is the only ones who has noticed this kind of house music. this IS house music! 'sands of time' or men of the nile's 'watch them come' and especially not anada projects 'cascades of color' there are classic deep dancefloor shakers. if you did that kind of soul then check dj's like tony humphries, larry heard, little 'louie' vega...etc. i'm hardly saying this is all those dj's spin, but it's a tip in the right direction. the 1st disc is hot.the second disc...is not."
5,Taste of Heaven,"Pure perfection, heaven captured, bliss. These are some of the thoughts that pop into my mind when I hear this CD mentioned. Danny Tenaglia has created a mix here with the power to change the listeners life with one listen (provided one is in the right state of mind to recieve his message). I suggest finding a real comfortable spot to lie, picking up your favorite headphones, turning off all the lights, and letting Danny T touch your life. It will be worth it."
3,"Great, but cannot stand up to Athens","The Athens cd will grow on you until it becomes a part of your musical soul: it will make you slicker, deeper, stronger and yet more sensitve. This one is just very good."
1,Crap,"Whatever in the world you do, DO NOT BUY these useless CDs. They are of the lowest possible quality (apparent from the complete transparency of the disc itself) and I have ended up tossing away at least 70% of them because they don't burn properly. Don't put yourself through the frustration!"
4,A Wonderful Double CD,A great compilation from one of the best groups from the British invasion. This compilation has forty songs that bring back nice memories.
3,Men's Clark Tippett Clog-Slip on,"The Clark Tippett clog is very well made and has good craftsmanship. However it is not as comfortable in the foot bed as the Merrell Clogs are. It really does not feel like it supports your feet, just feels like a flat surface. Also the back of the shoe is very low cut and it feels like it will not stay on your feet. The Merrell clogs also which I bought at the same time are very supportive and conture to the bottom of your feet, the back is higher and feels very secure on your foot, a better shoe for the same money. I will keep the Clark Tippett shoes and use them only as houseshoes, not street shoes."
3,Shoe review,Shoes are OK. First time I ordered this brand. Middle of the scale for comfort. Price was good for what you get.
4,"Expensive, but it protects your front element","Expensive, but it protects your front element. It's a lot cheaper to replace one of these than get your expensive lens repaired. This will not affect your shots negatively in any way."
4,"Better than using a UV filter, but it is thick",I have always had an issue with using UV filters since they will slightly tint your photo. These Nikon clear filters are great for lens protection and Nikon makes these with quality. I quit using UV filters and now only use clear filters for lens protection. The only disadvantage is the Nikon clear filters are thick so they will cause vignette on several wide angle lenses.
5,Slow and Steady,Karen Voight is an exceptional instructor with great versatility. This tape is designed for people who need to ease into fitness with reduced chance of injuries. Approriate for seniors as well as younger folks struggling with physical problems. This is a safe and sound way to build strength and begin a fitness routine.
2,Get what you pay for...,"Although this item provides many ways to measure distance, none of them seem to be very accurate. I like to track how far I've gone when I'm walking my dog. After the first few times that didn't seem to be correct, I walked established distances and they did not match. I even tried to use the ""steps"" count to figure distance, and it didn't even match the ""miles"" number. Oh well, you get what you pay for...."
4,Great gadget for the price,"This is the first pedometer I've ever owned so there's no real comparison, however, as a new user I've found it pretty easy to set up considering I am not too technically smart. The instructions were pretty simple to follow and the info I get back after my walks is very encouraging. Since getting to use this pedometer my walks have become longer and longer, and I feel great at being able to read an actual walked distance, calories burned and time walked. It's the simplicity of the unit that keeps me going."
3,Not as good as some claim,"In a sense it is a invaluable book, yet this is more because of the poverty of the field of study, than because of her journalistic skills and systemizing capacity. I found these to be rather weak, but in comparison to the 1000s of terrible books on this subject, I might recommend it."
5,REDSKINS...MODERN GLORY YEARS,A must have for the true fan. When Riggins ran hard and the cowboys just ran!HAIL TO THE REDSKINSHAIL VICTORY
5,Don't Get Better Than This For A 'Skins Fan,"After the dismal way this season turned out, being able to go back to some glory days was a great way to ""wait 'til next year."""
5,Joe Gibbs Era Was the Greatest,"The NFL Films documentaries on here are great, they bring back so many good memories. Haven't had a chance to watch the Gibbs & co. profiles on the special features but they look good. If you're a 'Skins fan and don't have the Super Bowls on tape already, this is your best bet!"
1,Ordered Feb 17 and still haven't received it...!,Almost two weeks after I was supposed to have received this dvd from DVD Legacy I'm still waiting. I got one email response over a week ago saying it was shipped and should be there any day now and a second email from me several days ago has not gotten a reply.I'm forced to rate the Dvd Legacy service instead of the dvd...and right now the service is not good.Once I eventually receive this dvd I'll be glad to review it but I've never had to wait this long for an item to be shipped that wasn't backordered.
5,Hail to the Redskins!,"Well, being from Chicago naturally I am a Bears fan; however, I am a football fan first and I must say that I loved the ""History of the Washington Redskins"". The 1st disc is very comprehensive, detailing the history of the Redskins and atmosphere of the Washington, DC area in the 50's and 60's and some good insight on the racism of the times, (the owner refused to have Black men on his team, in fact, the Redskins were the last team to have Black men on their roster). The 2nd disc has interviews with prominent Redskin players, Theismann and particularly one of my all time favorite backs Mr. John Riggins!This is a great dvd set of the Washington Redskins! Now, if NFL Networks would only produce the Minnesota Vikings, the Houston Oilers, the Buffalo Bills and the San Diego Chargers ""History of"", I would be in football heaven!!Great item! Go buy!"
2,Go for the NFL Americas game: Washington Redskins dvd instead,"this collection is too old and boring being a lifelong redskins fan I purchased this title and another with the super bowl rings on cover, by far the dvd with the rings more closely followed the redskin glory years and had great commentary by those teams players. FORGET this dvd it showcases other teams in playoffs while the other hails to the redskins! New note the other dvd that is far more superior is NFL: Americas game Washington Redskins also purchased on amazon, enjoy!"
5,NFL Super Bowl Collection - Washington Redskins,"Great Super Bowl highlights, but I would have really enjoyed it if it had shown more of the Redskins seasons, rather than spending most of the time showing all the other teams in the NFL. Otherwise, an excellent transaction!! AAAAA+++++"
5,Must Have For Devout Redskin Fans.,"Love the video. As a life long fan, I found this to provide a great historical perspective on a team with a rich history. Hail to the 'Skins!"
1,Not what it seems to be,Shipping was fine however the box does not say Betty Crocker on it or was there anything in the box that said Betty Crocker. The containers looked clear in the picture however my order came in tinted. Smaller round lids difficult to get off. Betty Crocker cookbook was replaced with Bake with Bob & Joyce. Will take a lot up a lot of space in cabinet.
2,Stackable...NOT Nestable,"The description of this product says they are space-saving and stackable. I interpreted that to mean nestable. They don't nest and therefore they do not save much space. Had I known that, I would not have purchased them. If you look closely at the picture, you will see that there are 2 pictured on top of each other with their lids on. This is what they mean by stackable. You can also put smaller ones inside bigger ones but even that is not a nice fit and also isn't convenient."
3,Good for Cooks who send food home...,"What I was looking for was an inexpensive way to send food home with folks, since most people are terrible about sending your good storage bins back home. I also wanted something that I would like to use myself, especially for freezing food, and was easy to open and close..and stayed closed. So far, these bins seem to be doing everything I want and need them to do. I am very happy with my purchase, with the exception of too many tiny bins in this set."
3,Of a divided mind,"It's not that these storage containers are bad, you see. They're sturdier than Gladware, they've held up nicely in my dishwasher, and they haven't warped.My main problem is with the way they store. As noted before by other reviewers, these do NOT nest in the way that Gladware or Rubbermaid do, so they take up an astonishing amount of space. The picture of the product shows about how condensed the containers can get for storage.My other pet peeve is that the divided dish does not STAY divided if the container is inverted or tipped sideways. Some people may like peach juice in their ravioli, but I'm not one of those.So on the one hand, it's a good price for something very durable. On the other, it's a beast to store. I'd like to echo some other reviewers and add that I was also missing pieces and lids and had some substitutions--which, for the price I paid, I didn't care all that much."
2,Poor Quality for the Price,"This item looks beautiful in the picture, but the quality is not so good. The material does not iron flat, and the back of the garment is not well made. there is elastic on the back of the pants cuff. why owuld they do that? Also the sailor bib does not go all the way around the back. Front is pretty though."
1,Good tool if you want cheap crap,"The manufacturer wanted to make certain these pliers come together at the tip. Rather than build pliers to a high standard and design, they simply curved them outward so that they do not come together in the middle at all -- but they do touch at the tip. It goes to show that you can either (1) cry when you buy tools because of the high price, but then be glad every time you use the tool, or (2) be glad about the low price when you purchase a tool, but then cry every time you use it. I regret that I was glad to purchase these pliers at such a low price."
3,original,new flava in the air this artist is original and thats what we need in the reggae business reggae is about roots and originality I hope to hear more from this young man soon big up
3,so-so,it includes a rip-off to BONEcrusher's hit record Never scared. I thought that was tasteless. The song with Crooked Letterz was tight. Some of the songs sucked
4,yesss......,"very good. and long awaited.this album was refreshing to say the least, it doesnt sound like everything else that is coming out nowadays in terms of hip hop. i just picked it up today, and listened through non stop a few times. many featured artists, which isnt necessarily bad but isnt great either. im guessing most fans would have wanted a litle more shock and a little less guest spots, but the guest appearances still dont take away from the CD. i liked it, you probably will too.p.s. the first and fourth tracks are incredible.buy it."
5,Another Beach Boy Classic!!,"Exclusivly from the ""genius"" himself (Brian Wilson) brings awsome, spiritual, and positivty Christmas Music, the Lords Prayer, Little Saint Nick, Santa's Beard are all personal favorites of mine! Great choice for holiday gifts!"
3,Get your facts straight before writing,"Hey, smarty-pants! While you're patting yourself on the back for writing another one of your ""reviews"", you should take the time to look up the Italian word for ""clams"". Then, try actually reading this book before submitting your comments."
5,Great Idea & Handles Too!,Great for microwave with turntable - IT'S ROUND! And it has handles for ease in removing without spilling or burning yourself trying to juggle potholders around the sides! The plastic lid really comes in handy for the fridge. Just a great product.
5,British comedy at its best!,"Yes, Prime Minister is a delightful British comedy about an MP who becomes the Prime Minister and finds out how politics is a very different game at that rareified level. Every sensible idea the Prime Minister comes up with is thwarted by his own staff, the military hierarchy, and representatives of other interest groups more focused on preserving their own control and way of doing things then in improving the system. This is all offered with that uncanny British dry wit and spot on timing often poking the most fun at the naive Prime Minister who actually thinks its his job to improve the system and life for ordinary Briish citizens."
3,Too much attitude from Sandra Palmer,"This Season Five would have been a great one if ""Sandra Palmer"" wasn't part of it. She had so much attitude and clearly was just on the way. She would have been tolerable if she didn't frown all the time and bent the rules for her own advantage!!! She wasn't a great actress..."
2,Disappointed,The dvd keeps freezing and won't go forward. My husband and I keep fighting with it but have still had to miss many portions of some episodes.
5,"Great show, great price",I think this is the best season yet! I can't wait for season 6 on Sunday!! :)
2,It becomes steadily sillier...,"I caught some episodes on TV. When I saw Jack going into an atmosphere of NERVE GAS (which acts on skin and therefore needs full suit protection) merely holding his breath, I lost interest. It still seems as cliff-hangerish as always, but I find that, in spite of this and the appealing characters (big Chloe fan!), I can't overlook the silliness."
2,Most unrealistic season.,"I have watched all seven seasons and this is the worse one. First, this is not the sixties or the very early seventies where you can rip the wires from underneath the dash and hot wire the car (you have to rip the ignition lock out to unlock the steering so you can steer the car). Second, air would be blowing through the ventilation ducts in Mall and most of the gas would have not entered the system, the scene at CTU was a little more convincing at least there was a fan moving a little air. Third how was the gas suppose to get into the gas lines at the Whitter Plant absorb it through the piping it was nothing but a room there was no way it would make it into the gas lines, even if they lowered the pressure it cannot magically transfer into the piping (maybe in the Star Trek world)."
2,"Unoriginal, full of clichés","Rehashed a lot of previously used plot themes. Found many scenes hard to swallow: sneaking on to diplomatic flight; Wellers character not checking if gun was loaded, no trained person would take a gun and not check that a bullet was in the chamber and many more. Found writing was sloppy compared to other seasons."
3,Missing Discs in package,Just noticed that I have 2 copies of Disc 5 & 6 and no copy of Disc 1 & 2. Check your order from Amazon for correct discs in package as soon as you get it. I am stuck with what I have since I will not mail it back at this time of year.
1,The lonely Russian president!,Two oddities: The war is ruled at a nice home by two old weird men.The Russian president is so lonely!
5,Another great season!,Season five starts out with a bang and a surprise. I like how there are always surprises on this show but yet each season is related to the previous one.
1,Awful PC,"Whoever said this show was ""right wing"" is totally nuts. Except for the nose, Pres Logan is a dead ringer for Nixon. In case we didn't ""get it"", they had him kneel in prayer with his Chief of Staff like Nixon did with Kissinger during Watergate, and when his helicopter landed in the final episode, he waved to the crowd exactly the same way Nixon did when his copter took him from the White House for the last time.6 1/2 of the 8 seasons had a black president. In all of those, the presidents were wise, honorable, saintly, and totally virtuous. The white presidents in the other 1 1/2 seasons were evil incarnate who make the real Nixon look like George Washington.And of course no one dare suggest that 5 years after 9-11, terrorists who want to attack us with nerve gas might be Muslims is completely taboo. Not from the religion of peace!This show was about as right wing as the ""West Wing""."
1,"Well, I was bored ...","The writers of this season of 24 should be tortured by the Jack Bauer viewers of the show used to know ... I was bored, the whole thing seemed to drag on forever, the mechanisms of the entertainment machine were too see-through to wow me with their effects.The only good thing I can say about this season? The most boring character on ""24"", Kim Bauer, showed up only briefly."
3,What losers are reviewing this,"So i look at the pre order list and see 24 season 5 - great!I see 25 reviews of a product not yet out so i am like wow.. this isodd.I then click reviews and see 25 sadcase fanboys telling us about the show not the product or extras or format etc.. sadcases.Kids if you are reading these, its not out till December - so these reviews are a joke."
1,"who needs superman or an army, one is enough :)","Unrealistic and boring, pitted against super enemies and super criminal organizations One Jack Bauer is enough to save the world. Is he the new James Bond or superman? He acts like he is invincible, or immortal. He even does not duck the bullets. Also with passing seasons he has to beat more tough opponents, I believe in the end the producers will give him the King Kong or the aliens to beat."
3,Ummm.,"Okay, I'm a huge 24 fan. Season five just didn't do it for me. And I'm not really sure why. Though I think most of it has to do with Charles Logan. Without any spoilers, I just didn't like him."
4,jack bauer is back from the dead,"So, this is , Day 5, incredible Action, new characters, very good Actors...Season 5 is actually the best Season, there is a very good Storyline, a plot involving the President of the USA, russian terrorists (thank god this time, there weren't muslims because 24 loves to take muslims for terrorists). Jack Bauer, back from the dead, is back on track with the help of Chloe, Audrey and Bill Buchanan, pursued by the Chinese at the season finale, saving again so many American Lives... Very good end of the season, leaves open the door to another interesting season 6...But, I only give 4 Stars, because I think this time, too much protagonists were killed or died and there is sometimes this feeling that some scenes about some people are missing..."
3,Going downhill,Seems not to be as good as the previous seasons. Killing off characters That made the show very fun to watch
4,24 videos,The Season Five box set arrived as expected. It was in good shape and I gave it as a gift. They receiver did not have any complaints to me about any problems or defects.
2,24 Wasted Hours,"I love the genre, and the production values are always well done, but this season of 24 is a waste of time. It's hard to blame the creators as they do fine with what they have, but the very nature of a one-day serial is fatally flawed. Jack Bauer, and the disaster(s) he alone can stop, must NEVER be resolved until the final (24th.) hour. Every trick in the book is used to prolong the story, and to keep Jack alive. This leads to LUDICROUS plot devices, which make watching it often painful. If this doesn't matter to you, then I'm sure you will enjoy it, but if a plot or story needs to make sense to be pleasurable, this season will drive you mad. Obviously, a LOT of care, talent, and clever ideas went into making this, but at the end of the day, I knew that I had thrown away a entire day, watching smoke and mirrors signifying nothing."
2,24 gets dumber seasons 5 and 6,Seasons (Days) 1 - 4 were great...5 and 6 are lousy...and 6 became difficult to stay awake while viewing one unrealistic plot after another unfold.
5,24- It just keeps getting better,"I now own all 5 seasons and am looking forward to the excitement of season 6. A must have for all ""24"" fans. The format in season 5 was made easier and the quality is superb. Without a doubt this is the most exciting and suspenseful show on TV."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Love it, love it, love it. What more can I say? I love the entire series of ""24"" and plan on purchasing each season."
5,24 - Season Five,I got hooked on 24 about a year ago and love watching the CD's versus TV with all its commercials. I recommend this series to anyone loving excitement. Season 1 thru 4 are fantastic as well.
5,24- Season 5,"Only started watching 24 last year mid-season. Now after much viewing, I am ready for ""6"" to begin! Can't wait. Love the show!!!"
3,Couple of songs are good,"Other than the song of the title and the song right after it, I was not too crazy about this album. It is well done, just not my style."
4,Nice Surprise.,"I wasn't sure what to expect - it was a free download for my ipod touch (kindle app). I found it to be a sweet story. I will actually pay to get book 2 in the series when it comes out. Sweet, suspenseful romance - the male hero is a little too much but many authors are getting into this over the top alpha."
3,a good way to spend a rainy afternoon,"although confusing at first, you finally get which characters are which. i would have liked more background on the characters, but it was a good read."
4,good one,"Roy's third album. It contains the rare but fantasic ""Lonely Wine""Some good sides here and some fodder as well."
4,Quick Look at your favorite songs,"Even if you don't consider yourself a major Sinatra fan, you have heard many of these songs & there have to be mroe than a few that you love. This neat book will give you a little glimpse into the history of these recordings - year recorded & with what band, CDs it appeared on & a capsule summary. Most interesting to me is where the song first appeared - show tune, earlier film & who recorded it. Because of the way Frank later took that song & made it his own, it is hard to belive it had a prior life! An enjoyable companion piece worth owning."
3,"good DSP primer, needed more on the audio/music applications","I bought this expecting a thourough primer for audio software development (soft realtime signal generation, filtering, many examples, some code). Nope. Just calculus. It reads very well, it is a great book, but it does not show you how to implement using software or even pseudocode.For easy fun-to-read coverage on theoretical DSP, and for a small taste of DSP with respect to audio (1 small chapter), this book is five stars.Since it wasn't what I needed (jeez, who does make a book like what I want anyway? I want to write a modular synth in software, lots of FX, filters, etc..), I give it only 3 stars.. :("
3,"Too much theory, not enough practice","This book has plenty of DSP theory but not enough practical application for my taste. It's also designed to be a textbook, with problems at the end of each chapter; not very useful to me. If you aren't comfortable with calculus, this book isn't for you."
2,This book requires a good knowledge of calculus.,"This book presupposes that the reader has a strong background in calculus. I never had a college math course and got stuck on the formulas on the first few pages. I hope to get through this book with the help of an intro. to calculus book I borrowed, but it is extremely slow going. I have a BFA in music and a PhD in AI so I thought, based on the title of the book, that the book would be understandable to me. I was wrong. Based on the other reviews, a person without my math deficiencies would find this book a good intro to DSP."
4,Nicely done,"This CD has been in regular rotation in my car lately; a nice compilation of music by various bands, all tracks about Neil Gaiman's stories. Some of my personal favorites include Rasputina's ""Coraline"", and Tapping the Vein's ""Trader Boy"".""Even Gods Do"" got me to start re-reading (I don't know how many times now) American Gods. Ego Likeness, who I'm starting to search for more tracks of, has a song based off of Stardust (again re-read at least twice since purchasing this cd.)There are still a few tracks on the cd I've not been able to fully appreciate yet. They've just not come up to what I'd expect.To be honest, I'm glad there's a balance between stories...at least it's not a compliation all from the sandman novels.."
5,I think it is a good movie...,for the point it is making. We should all be so knowledgeable and bold in our witness. I have owned this movie on VHS for many years and am glad I found it on DVD.
5,"Excellent Excellent - FULL OF SCRIPTURE, CLEAR PRESENTATION","EXCELLENT MOVIE FOR ALL PEOPLE - It will move the Christian to be prepared, diligent in study, and have pure motives, while at the same time, explaining in great detail the wonderful works of God over the ages and the possibilities regarding His soon returnTeen and older will enjoy."
2,High Hopes Didn't Pan Out,"I had great hopes for this collection, but wound up sadly disappointed. Discounting the fact that the shows' video had not been cleaned up in the slightest, with a few episodes being of extremely poor quality, I would've still been content in watching the artistry of a master comedian. But the collection has other problems. I've had two sets now, in which the DVDs lock up at different places. Amazon has been great about replacing them. But the problem remains. In frustration, I'm simply keeping what I now have, but would recommend any other potential buyers to consider this before making a purchase."
5,Marilyn Monroe in the first episode!,"Jack Benny, with his subtle wit, kept me laughing from beginning to ending. Lots of old comedians and comidiennes appeared to charm me."
3,no si/sy routine,amazon's best of jack benny lacked the si/sy routine where benny asks question and hispanic mel blanc answers si. johnny carson said this was the epitome of radio humor.
4,Very Similar to the Best of Jack Benny 4 disc set,"This set includes a Mill Creek production of a Jack Benny ""Documentary"". Well, I guess it is. Announcer sits and talks, then they cut to various episodes that are included in this set. I don't know, it was ok I guess. The biggest thing I noticed is that they cut out a General Electric Theater episode ""The Face is Familiar"" from the 4th disc. The above reviewer (Annie Van Auken)may have reviewed the Best of Jack Benny 4 disc set because she is still showing the 2nd General Electric Theater show which was removed to make room for the ""Documentary"". I have the other 4 disc set already, and was looking forward to upgrading with this documentary set. Now I'll either have to keep both, or lose the 2nd General Electric Theater episode.This is the other set that includes all of these episodes plus the ""The Face is Familiar"" GE theater piece.Best of Jack Benny"
5,A great look back...........,"A warm and fuzzy look back at a great comedian and a chance to see all the old entertainers who are long gone. I always wondered why we have not seen re-runs of the Jack Benny Show on TV like we do the Lucy shows, but viewing the old shows soon made it clear. Lucky Strike commercials not only have small commercial breaks, but in many shows,commercials have been worked into the skits performed in the shows. This aside, it is still worth buying. Jack Benny, Rochester and the host of visiting stars are a wonderful trip back in time. The film quality does vary, but is still viewable. I don't think anyone who enjoyed Jack Benny in the old days will be disappointed."
2,jack benny,as a jack benny fan was disappointedthat the dvd would not work in mycomputer. returned it to amazonwith no problems.
3,I got half of what I paid for,"Jack Benny was the funniest show ever to appear on television. Unfortunately, half of the programs on these discs would not play at all. The ones that would play were extremely grainy."
4,It is the good old days!!,"i HAVEN'T PLAYED ALL OF IT YET, BUT i LIKE WHAT i HAVE SEEN. I WILL PLAY MORE THIS WEEK."
5,more of Jack Benny,"How could we forget Don Wilson, Rochester and Dennis Day. The world may have progressed but watching Benny is watching class in action."
3,For Nostalgia Buffs Only,"Content was fun; although, shows back then were basically commercials (Lucky Strike was the ""star""). The quality was bad....couldn't even watch 3 or 4 shows out of the four DVDs. Won't send back because it wasn't that expensive but not sure I can recommend. You have to be a real fan to buy. The best was Jack Benny in the G.E. Theater shows with R. Reagan as host."
3,Jack Benny is appealing as always,"I was/am a fan of Jack Benny. But I didn't find these shows as compelling as I anticipated. Humor back then was much more casual than today; it was interesting to see the various guest stars, but the skits lack the boffo laughs I was expecting. It's a pleasant trip down memory lane, but not much more than that...I smiled and chuckled occasionally, but don't expect humor on the scale of ""Cheers"", ""Will & Grace"", etc."
1,Very disappointing,"[ASIN:B000UVV260 Best of Jack Benny]]I looked forward to getting this set of DVDs because I loved the old Jack Benny show. This made it all the more disappointing when I viewed the DVDs and found that that were of such poor quality. To be sure, the episodes from the 50s were likely recorded from kinescope, but these recordings made everything look much worse. They were completely unwatchable, so I sent them back. Surely there must be a good set of recordings of the Jack Benny Show available for fans to enjoy this great comedian once again. What a loss if this is all that's available."
1,"Love Jack, hate Mill Creek's garbage release","Save your money on this one. The best picture on any of these episodes is fair at best. The ""Honeymooners"" episode is so poor that you can't even make out the people in the episode. It looks like a dupe of a dupe of a dupe of a VHS tape.Mill Creek should be embarrassed for putting out junk like this."
4,Jack Benny DVD's,"Have only looked at the 1st disk. While some complained about the quality, I recognize the period in which it was filmed - we're lucky to have these classics. It's also great to see the big name stars of the period on his shows.I'm not an audiophile or videophile. If it doesn't have static or a lot of snow, I can tolerate it if it's something I want to watch."
4,Best of Jack Benny show.,Would have liked the commercials left ot of the copy. But over all enjoyed the wall down memory lane. I would like to get more of these old shows.
4,still laughing!!,"WELL......The best of the best JB collection, even includes episodes that Jack guest starred on like burns & allen!!! Don't miss the one where the Benny family is the espisode!! Jack beams on stage like the proud papa he was!! How sweet!....Make it an evening where you laugh 2 your heart's content, even if the main attraction has a fancy 4 playing his beloved violin a lil off key, lol!!!....Enjoy"
2,best of jack benny,"So dissapointed,the sound ok,but the quality is poor,no detaill really,really a waste of money,same applies to the groucho Marks dvd I paid forJack Benny"
3,A must for Jack Benny fans,"If you are a Jack Benny or early TV fan you'll enjoy this. Jack's timing and delivery was fantastic. It's basically his radio show adapted to TV with all the usual characters including Rochester. Having the DVD's stacked in individual sleeves is a bit unsual, but seems to work okay."
1,This company needs to do their homework...,"I haven't watched this DVD, but the company who produced this DVD of public domain episodes (as all Benny DVDs only contain the public domain episodes) needs to do their homework. The main picture on the cover is NOT Jack Benny...it's an actor named Eddie Carroll who plays Jack Benny in a very good stage show."
3,This book is for ADVANCED pattern makers,GREAT book for ADVANCED pattern makers. I am not one of them. I love more detail on top of detail coupled with simplicity instructions. This book is not that. I found more simplistic lingerie and beachwear pattern instructions on the internet. Don't get me wrong this book has some good information in it BUT for the ADVANCED pattern maker.
4,upgrading,perfect to complete you cutting skills. a specific book on a matter which is usually superficially examined in pattern making classes.ok!
4,Trrrrrès bien!!!!!!Mais pour créateurs expérimentés,"Je ne recommanderais pas ce livre a un débutant.Par contre,ce livre est parfait pour clarifier certain problèmes que l'on peut rencontrer lors de la coupe et du moulage d'un patron sur mesure.Par ailleur,les autres livres de cette série sont exellents!Je dirais,une bible pour la coupe de patrons de lingerie et maillots de bain."
2,"Ill-fitting, Not made to spec","I purchased this particular cable here to connect my external eSATA drive to the eSATA port on my motherboard. I've been using a standard SATA to eSATA cable before to hook up 'loose' drives, and I looked forward to using this cable to get the best performance possible out of my primary backup device.Sadly, I found the cable did not properly plug-in to my eSATA port; as it turns out, part of the outer metal connection designed to secure the cable was roughly 2mm removed from the rest of the connector. As a result, it did not fit into half of my eSATA ports. Crimping the metal resolved this, but the fact that I needed to do anything to it at all simply reeks of poor quality. I'm giving it 2 stars simply because I can now use it.Buy this cable at your own risk."
4,Welcome back,"While Robert and Grant have both had their moments during their respective solo careers, this album demonstrates that the Go-Betweens were always greater than the sum of their parts. I was fortunate enough to catch them live (for the first time!) recently in SF and it was great to see a) how well songs like Magic In Here and Spirit measure up against the old classics b) the way these two very talented musicians feed off each other. While the overall sound may hark back to the Before Hollywood era, there's a maturity now to the songwriting that allows the gorgeous melodies to really shine (esp. Heart and Home). Given that the old farts belted this one out in less that two weeks, let's hope we get something from them this year too!"
5,Great to have you back together again boys!,"Having seen Robert and Grant together last year during the acoustic tour, we knew that a new studio release was forth coming. I kind of miss Amanda Brown's violin and oboe, but the boys can still write fine tunes indeed! Here's hoping that this is not a one-off deal, and we see another 5 studio releases! Still rates 5 stars, but not quiet as good as 16LL, Liberty Belle, and Before Hoolywood."
4,yes please,"this is a close-to-triumphant return of an amazing, critically-respected/criminally neglected band. the only caveat i have is that, at times, the Sleater-Kinney/Quasi rhythm section on this seems, in true indie-incompetent fashion, one step behind the two-step stepout of Robt and Grant. but this is right up there, for me, with last year's ""the king of good intentions"" by the black watch and all of the Mogwai releases. get it! yes, please."
1,Not much life and not very fast,"A VERY disappointing movie, and I bet that only a very small group of people will find it funny. It would have been a better movie if it had been an animated cartoon, I think. I am sure that I have seen less-funny movies, but none that were categorized as comedies."
4,Kings of Cajun,"Several old favorites that can also be found on other Cajun collections (""Pine Grove Blues,"" ""Les Flammes d'Enfer,"" etc.) with good remastering of the older sides. The pick of the crop, though, may be Horace Trahan's ""Amitie Casser"", which I haven't seen collected elsewhere. On the strength of this example, I'm looking forward to hearing Trahan's CD ""Osson Blues."""
2,Color photographs removed,"Others can speak to the scholarship of this anthology, my comments are to compare this smaller paperback edition (0192801333) to the hardback (0198200730) and two larger paperback editions, (0192854356) and (0198200730). The key word in the title is ""illustrated"".The hardback edition has 26 full page color plates, 22 maps, and approximately 187black/white photographs distributed throughout the book on good quality paper.This smaller paperback has no color pictures except the front cover, 12 black/white plates, and the 22 maps.The photography in the illustrated editions is excellent and adds greatly to the presentation of the authors. One cannot help but be impressed by the talent and craftsmanship exhibited by individuals in their time.If the purchase price has lead the reader to this smaller paperback, my suggestionis to go with a used hardback."
2,tightest is ok and thats that,"When I first went to tightest's website it seemed like he would be the next big thing in rap/hip hop. According to the way he made his music sound but when you hear his music it's ok but nothing more than average. He has ok lyrics but there are many out there better than him even in his own area of IL.Like Sonik Flow who is also white is a much better rapper than him.If you want an mediocre album buy it if not I would recommend Sonik Flow,Eminem,or even Bubba Sparxxx"
1,sounded good,"I have been a hip hop rap fan all my life and I seen alot of one hit wonders go through the industry, and basically that's all I thought of this album or tightest whitest he does have good lyrics and an alright flow but there are others in his area better than him like Sonik Flow if you want a good album buy flow's not this"
5,Nice Pliers,These are good sturdy pliers. I have been using these to pull up staples from our hardwood floors. They have a good grip both on the handle and what you're using it on. I have even pulled up nails with these. Great purchase!
5,"Great tool, great price!","Found this pair of pliers and I am so glad I bought them! They are every bit as good as brands costing twice as much! Great seller, fast delivery... overall very satisfied!"
5,just the facts,"Capon gets down to business and explains how plants work. No more will the reader/gardener utter such pablum as ""pinching forces energy down instead of up in the plant."" She/he will intelligently note that pinching the apical meristem decreases the hormones that control upward growth, thus increasing the activity of hormones controlling lateral growth. Very well explained facts about how plants do what they do."
3,"""Botany for Gardeners"" is not for every gardener","I found this book to be helpful as a overview type coverage in botany, but it left a lot to be desired. It was not written for gardeners as the title may imply. This is a rather heavy text for the ordinary gardner, and not enough for a Botany student. I found the text to be poorly arranged, with poor chapter content. This is a text that would be good for a gardener that is really interested in learning more, but leaves a lot to be desired in some of the explanations."
2,Not really for gardeners,"I love gardening, reading, and science, so I was very hopeful when I saw the title of this book. The title sounds very interesting. This book left me disappointed. It felt like work to read. There were interesting tidbits about plants, but they were buried in mind-numbing details.Opening the book at random I find this quote:""The chemical name for natural auxin, produced by plants, is indole-3-acetic acid, or IAA. Several synthetic substances (naphthaleneacetic acid, or NAA; 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, or 2,4-D, etc.), having auxin-like effects when applied to plant tissues, have been studied and are used commercially.""Fortunately, the entire book isn't written this way, but there are way too many sentences just like this one."
5,Write HIS word on your kid's heart...,"This has been a great family devotion to use with my boys 5 & 7. It guides us in applying scripture to our lives and fighting the temptations we all battle. My boys do struggle with ""what do you think about..."" type questions, largely due to their young age. It opens up opportunities to talk about all kinds of temptations to sin like being stubborn, or rude, or prideful to mention just a few."
2,I would not recomend the Honeywell TE-923W,"I purchased the Honeywell TE-923W, the software that come with it does not work on windows Vista. Also the unit keep losing its signal from the remote sensors. The remotes are less than 20 ft from the main unit. This is my second Honeywell. I have first purchased TE821 and it did not hold its signal either. I should have bought a Davis weather station. All my friends have Davis and have no problems with them at all. With a name like Honeywell, I thought this would be a great unit. I was wrong.I'm very unhappy with the Honeywell TE-923W.I hope this will help you out in your choice.Thanks, Don"
4,Good station,"The station was very easy to setup and works exactly as designed. I wish the software had more features such as builtin ftp, web creation tools, and setups to cummuicate dircetly with organizations such as weather underground"
3,It worked with out the PC,Never worked wellwith the PC. The sensors didn't weather too well. The base unit still works but the sensors died after a couple of seasons in the UV
1,Misleading support department,"Before buying this item, I telephoned Honeywell tech support and specifically stated that my home is a steel frame building and I have difficulty with wireless telephone service inside. I was concerned about this unit communicating with the wireless anemometer, rain unit and outside temp unit. I was assured that there would be no issue.I have had the system operational for about 2 weeks now and generally like the format BUT, the anemometer readings appear to be low in winds over 15 mph and more importantly, the unit has lost the anemometer signal several times already requiring a reset. The anemometer is located above our elevator roof entrance and less than 30 feet from the location of the main unit.I called the Honeywell/Meade tech support line and was told my issue is probably environmental -- steel frame building -- and that I should contact the company I purchased it from and see if they will accept its return.WHAT PITIFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE HONEYWELL IS OFFERING!!!!"
2,TE923W review,"I agree with all who say the directions are TERRIBLE and I'm good w/reading manuals. There are mistypes, MUCH missing information and MANY assumptions that you will have to guess or figure out on your own. Once we got the unit set up, some things worked well, others didn't. The temp & humidity are OK. The TEMP w/WIND CHILL is off. No matter what the wind chill is, say 22, the TEMP w/WIND CHILL is always the SAME as the regular TEMP(WITHOUT wind chill factor). I'm going to try to reset the unit and revisit this in the spring. ALSO, it is now DST and the CLOCK on the unit has NOT reset, nor has the sunset & sunrise. It reads time automically from the Atomic Clock, so I don't know what the problem is. I tried to reset the clock an hour ahead manually and that worked until the next day when the Atomic clock reset itself back an hour to the incorrect time!"
2,Good Temp and Humidity - Bad Wind and Manual,"Like some of the others here, I have been unable for six months to get the wind speed and direction to work. The temp and humidity have done a good job as has the rainfall mode, but the manual was apparently written by someone with a less than stellar command of English and is very difficult to understand. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,good hardware; poor software,"If you want current readings, it is very nice. The record-keeping software is very poor. Trying to view the records of anything other than the past 24 hours is very erratic and usually impossible. I have never seen any product with worse software."
2,No extras,"The good thing first: Classical baby has very nice animations and the music choosen is nice too. BUT, it is very short and it does not contain any extras, there is just the animations nothing more. The package says something about a parents guide but thats just a small booklet inside thats really just an advertisement. I was hoping that some real instruments appear and people showing how to play them, as an extra this would be very useful. Well, I am disappointed by this DVD! And my kids (4 y. and 17 m.) too, they looked it one time - nearly, and dont want it any more."
2,Doesn't cut it,"It may just be my baby, but she has no interest in it. She is 5 1/2 months old and loves the Baby Einstein series, Baby Mozart and Language Nursery in particular. However, she has no interst inthis series whatsoever-to each their own I suppose. Unfortunate waste of money for me though."
5,What Baby Eistein wishes it could be.,"I discovered Classical Baby, The Art Show by tivoing it, and was instantly hooked, as was my toddler. This was much more in keeping with what I thought video entertainment should be, with original orchestrations, and iconic art. I, like many parents, am not crazy about parking my toddler in front of the television, but when we sit together and talk about the scenes or move to the music, I feel like this is as close to getting to a museum as we can get on a day to day basis. The Music Show is also wonderful, with great performances of a wide range of musical styles, from contemporary compositions to the most beautiful arias."
4,"Good for babies, enjoyable music for parents",This video is good for little ones if introduced young. Our daughter likes it and is just now growing out of it - at 2. Its so much more friendly on the parent's ear too :o)
5,"Classical Baby 3-pack (music, art & dance) is a must have!",My 16 month old loves it and has been hooked on this DVD collection since he was 6 months old.If you want your kid to appreciate the finer things in life... this is a must have!
1,What does this teach about music?,"Aside from listening to classical music (which one could just as easily do with a CD), This does not really teach a baby about music.Exposure is fine, of course, but babies are so super smart that it you can teach them anything! There are much better educational options for baby (i.e., Trebellina DVD, which teaches about notes, instruments, recordings of symphony orchestras, etc, even Brainy Baby Music, Piano by Dot for an older child). My child is ready to learn and I want to teach him. Music Show doesn't quite do the trick."
5,Enchanting Diversion,"My 11 month old delights in this DVD. If we hum music from the DVD, especially the opening theme, she grins and bobs with recognition. While watching the DVD, she waves excitedly to her favorite characters. The last piece, Baby's Blanket, aka Claire de Lune, makes her sleepy (if needed, we replay that track a couple of times).Frankly, I shield her from most television and movies, but this DVD is so enchanting that I play it as a treat and diversion when she is fussy - particularly when she is seemingly inconsolable from teething or ear ache pain. She takes great pleasure in it, and to my surprise, I also enjoy it, despite repeat viewing."
3,"Dvd okay, but lack of clarity from seller and overpricing in this case","I like the DVD - its great. I really do not have time to sort through and read every tid-bit of information. I need to be able to determine quickly the price, value, and purchase. I thought when I placed the order I was getting three music DVDs but instead I got a funky toy and one DVD. The box was smashed too - nothing was broke though. There is an option to by the loose DVD for ~ $8.00 on Amazon, so my assumption was due to the size and price I was getting a set of three. Not a good value in this particular case. The loose DVDs is better because the toy is worthless and paying ~12.00 more for it pisses me off. -3 for lack of clarity about item and over charging and -1 for length of dvd.DVD = 4/5CustomerSatisfaction = 2/5score = 6/10 = 0.4(5 possible stars) = 3 starsP.S. Baby Einstein is good too - its hard to say one is better than the other - they're different."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,Even if I didn't have children I would very much enjoy this--I have been watching it EVERY night for over a year with my now 2 year old and my new 6 month seems to love it too--they are both completely mesmerized by this. Caught it on HBO and have it on my dvr but will buy this DVD to have forever and for sleepovers. My favorite opera aria and duet as well as great instrumental pieces and the animation is great and unique to each selection of music. Well Done!! Also PERFECT for bed time and getting the kids sleepy if not konked out!
5,Twins Nightly Routine,"We use this video (or one of the other two) as part of our 18-month-old twins naptime and nightly routine. They are so used to it, they now nod off before it's over more often than not. It's less than 30-minutes long, and the beautiful, easy-for kids to see animation is matched only by the quality of the music choices. I even love to watch the credits to Brahms' Lullaby.Get it."
4,"My Daughter Loves This, Finally!","My daughter at 6 months old LOVED watching Transiberian Orchestra on DVD. It kept her attention for a good straight 15 minutes. (which was great at such a young age) However, this Classical Baby DVD she didn't care for. Then when she was almost 3 she found the DVD on the shelf and asked to watch it so I let her. She totally loved it! She especially loved the song ""the Rectangles"" which is from Westside story. She asked to play it over and over and she would dance like no one was watching! Then one day the commericial from Westside Story Broadway play came on and she recognized the song from it. She was so excited.It's so nice to see her appreciating this music. She also likes the dancing one too. The only thing I don't like is that they change the music a little. I wish it was more like the original music."
3,Sometimes things don't always work out the way you envisioned.,"My disappointment is not with the seller, but with the size of the hood. It is quite large and I didn't realize this when I purchased it. Too bad I can't get a hood that is more cylindrical and takes up less space in my camera bag."
2,Who picked these songs?......,"This has to be the worst SD best of I've ever seen. Don't know who made the selections on this CD, but any of the other ones out there are much better. Save your money here.Jim"
5,book,"I am pleased with this book,I read a lot of Cassie Miles and enjoy her writing and I will buy from her again"
5,A pretty and pleasant surprise!,"This would make a lovely birthstone ring for a person of any age. The stone was of good color and ample size. There was plenty of silver, making it large enough for an adult. Since I like things with balance and symetry, it was pleasing to my eye. It was a ""small size 6"". Arrived in an adorable shiny ring box with a tiny bow. It would be hard to go wrong purchasing this pretty ring!"
3,Best Deitel book I've read...,"I've read the Deitel Java, VB and C++ books prior to this. All of these books were marred by poor color choices (text and background), errors in the code and the fact that you needed a teacher to explain the book to you. This is not the case with this book. It's seems the Old guy and the Young guy have learned a thing or two about what students require in a learning guide. This book is for Internet Explorer ONLY. No examples of cross browser code is here. This book alone will NOT make you a web developer but what it will do is start you down that path. I do have some complaints though. This book, like the others, is designed for the classroom. That being said you will get the most from it in a classroom setting with a competant teacher. My recommendation to the Guys is to have a public book available that has the answers to the questions in an appendix along with the complete chapter ending projects on a CD. Keep a separate edition for the classroom use."
5,Great book for Teaching!,"I am using ""Internet and World Wide Web How to Program"", in a couple of classes I teach at a local college. It is fine text for teaching or self studying web programming. I strongly recommend it to everyone!"
3,Ok Overview,"Breadth of information, but very little depth. It is certainly mistitled as ""How to Program."" Instead, a more appropriate sub-title would be: ""A Brief Overview."" Authors are not very careful on many occasions at pointing out what technologies are proprietary vs. standard."
3,Internet and World Wide Web: How to Program,The positive points are that a wide list of relevant topics in internet data management have been covered. An extensive list of WWW links relevant to each topic has also been provided at the end of each chapter which is very useful. On the flip side this book has been written in a hurry ! I am disappointed that many descriptions are not that rigorous and clear as one would one want for a course (or any) text.
2,***WARNING*** Not for the visual learner!,"Not for people who learn VISUALLY, that much is clear. I love the Web, I designed my first site in 1995. I sell Internet advertising and also have a freelance Web design business, so I wanted to sharpen my skills. Whoo. This book is great...if you are looking for a sleep aid! YAWN... I have very strong computer skills, and have taught myself some difficult stuff (including HTML from just reading other people's code). I took a class where this book was given out, and it was the most boring, dry, difficult to wade through text I've ever experienced. I can honestly say I got NOTHING from this text. It may be their approach, writing style, who knows? But if you can read and retain information presented abstractly, give this book a try. But if you need to get your hand on the mouse and drive, with a textbook at hand--do yourself a favor and get a Visual Quickstart Guide (Peachpit Press). You'll be grateful you did!"
3,This book is difficult to follow,"If you are not an experienced programmer, try a different book. I am a student in an IT program and our first course used this book. It jumps all over the place, introduces new concepts with out telling you, and the exercises can't be done without referencing other material.Authors have a serious geekness problem."
3,Internet and World Wide Web: How to Program,"Nice and playful introduction to virtually any type of internet related programming. Is a great resource for a ""boot camp"" type of training, much along the lines of the classic ""Essential Client/Server Survival Guide"" by Orfali et al. Contains many ready-to-run example programs in Perl, HTML, Javascript, you name it. The only serious draw-back is that the book presumes a Microsoft-only setup, it contains many examples that simply will not work on Netscape or non-windows computers. Unlike other books in this category these incompatibilities are not properly indicated (otherwise the book would have been worth a full 5 stars)."
5,great product,I love the set. It adds a lot to the kitchen.If you like Arthur court products you should have one of these.
2,So So,The ear piece comes off easily...if you are not careful you could loose one. Then you end up having to buy extras.
1,terrible product,"earphones are of very poor quality and I will not use them because they sound very scratchy and very hard to hear out of, very poor all around."
1,Night Hoops,"This book was a great book. I like the way Trent was helped by Nick. One thing I didn't like was the violence. I am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. I would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. That is what I thought about Night Hoops.Sunny Blocko"
1,Not as advertised,"The item shipped in NO WAY represented the item shown in the ad photo. Nor did it work with my razor. Nor did the seller make any attempt whatsoever to provide me with the right product or even ask why I couldn't use it.This item flat will NOT work with the razor it's advertised for. It doesn't have the reservoir as pictured, it can't even control the razor to charge it or make it run through the cleaning cycle."
2,Interesting but not informative,Having stumbled across this title on Amazon and having a passing interest in Tattoos i thought i'd give this DVD set a shot. As a MTV style 'real world' take on life in a Tattoo parlour it succeeds but as a means to learn more about tattooing or it's history it doesn't.You learn far too much about the personal lives of the staff working in the parlour than you do anything about tattooing which is dissapointing.
2,FOR LATER,I you can avoid to purchase this DVD you won't regret it. You can find another tv-series with the same type and even better.
4,Good!,Didn't expect the bleeps but because it was an AE production I understand. Great content though!
2,inconsistency,"Pritkin split pea soup is inconsistent. Some cans are thin with a hand full of peas, while others are too thick and needs added water just to heat, which doesn't help with the already flat taste."
2,An OK product,"I like Atomic Kitten a heck of a lot, but this CD left me feeling... used. Do not get me wrong, AK can sing great, and they are an awesome group, but the only interesting thing about this product are the 2 unreleased songs (at least they were unreleased in the U.S.), and even then they are OK. I only recommend this CD to those Atomic Kitten fans out there who just have to have every one of their CDs. Overall, not impressed"
3,Metal LensHood,"It is difficult to screw and unscrew. If you have to use a filter, you have to unscrew it.It is made of metal, a little hit with anything, and the lenshood lose its shape, and interfer with the image.Its really expensive for a lenshood."
5,...,"Violence is one of the best metal albums I've ever heard. Every song is a masterpeice. With hellish screams and stunning singing, vocalist Matt Holt delivers a nerve-scarring performance. From heavy guitar molestations to acoustic melodies, guitarist Tom Maxwell leaves you in utter shock. Chris Houck on drums and Bill Gaal on bass put you in a trance of terror and bewillderment. From the horror of Blue Skin, the punch of American Love, and the moderate solitude of For All the Sin, Nothingface will amaze you. Experience the finest that metal has to offer."
3,Eh,"This isn't bad, but Nothingface's ""Violence"" is hardly a necessary addition to anyone's metal collection. I just can't get into this synthetic sounding nu-metal riffing."
3,"It's not bad,but it's nothing special","Nothingface is like many other bands,a sterotypical angry metal band. Who doesn't realy have anything to angry about. But still even with that the music doesn't sound bad. But I've heard alot better. They could try being more origional,or yelling alittle less. It's just that all of these angry bands sound the same. They could try being different. But still they didn't,and they should of. Seeing as how they've been around alittle longer than lot's of these angry bands I'll give them alittle more credit. So if you like your music loud,angry,and...umm angry (wtf?) check out Violence by Nothingface."
1,blah blah blah,aside from this tiny review...If I can't say anything nice about Nothingface....then I'll choose to say nothing at all.
2,Stupid Shouting,"Nothingface is only shouting with no melody. The guitar is ok but still too heavy. It's ok, but I think the whole cd stinks. Yep."
4,Pretty decent...,"This singer's voice is interesting - he can really growl well and sounds good when just singing regularly. The music itself is fairly heavy, but seems (to me) little more than background noise, complimentary addition to the vocals. I would recommend this over most any nu-metal CD, with the exceptions of Mudvayne's ""L.D. 50"" or Amen's ""We Have Come For Your Parents"".... and if you disagree with my remark about the ""background noise"" listen to some Pantera, Slayer, or older Sepultura & Metallica."
4,Awesome CD,"I bought this expecting an all-out Moshfest of heavy music close to Slipknot, aand it wasnt exactly what i got, but it was close. If u like bands like Slipknot, and Deftones, and and even old machine head, then you'll probably like this. The singer doesnt have the best singing voice, it has too much ""echo"" in the CD, you'll know what i mean after listening to a few tracks, but his Screaming voice is brutal. He screams a lot too. Almost all of the songs are good, but the best songs are Make Your Own Bones, Bleeder, For all Sin, Cant wait for violence, Dead Like Me, Blue Skin, Filthy (best song), american love, and piss and vinegar. Piss and vinegar is a really heavy song. Showing that these guys can sing, as well as scream. The drums are great, they have 2 drummers or something like that, and the bass goes right along with the heavy distorted guitar. Some of the riffs sound the same sometimes, but who cares. If u like Hard Heavy metal without the rap influence, then get this."
5,Nothingface,"Knowing these guys personally may make this review a little biased, but I'll go ahead with it anyway. I have enjoyed their sound for awhile, and while not mainsteam, ""Violence"" has captured the attention of many metal fans, and has even went to the mainstream a little bit with the song ""Dead Like Me"", which I think is their best song yet.This is a very good album for any metal fan."
4,Very Overall Guide to Civil War Battlefields,"I recently toured several battlefields in PA, VA, and MD. This book accompanied me wherever I went. It is a good, functional introduction to the battlefields. It really helped to review this guide nightly before reaching the battlefield next day, so I had a daily starting point and agenda. It also helped to fill in some historical perspective not offered by the US Park Service maps & brochures. I would recommend it to anyone touring a Civil War battlefield."
2,Nice try,"There are some good things here, and it's definitly better than nothing at all, but really - aeroplano? Try avion. Please watch the aglicisms. The goal is spanish, not spanglish."
2,Don't bother with this one.,"I just bought this for my one year old. It's a neat idea to use the songs to teach spanish but overall I'm not impressed. The sound quality is bad making the words of the songs hard to understand. I was hoping the animation would be a bit more concrete so that she would be able to figure out more of the spanish from the pictures. This tape wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.We also have the Bilingual Baby - Spanish tape. While it bores me, she will watch all 45 minutes through if I let her. If you want a spanish tape buy this one. I'm going to start looking for a audio cassette of spanish children's songs."
5,What can I say? This CD rocks!,"Incredible album. Great lyrics! I have been fortunate to actually meet two of the band members, David himself and the bassist, Scott Ambush. Wonderful, talented people! You won't regret buying this CD!"
4,College Student Food,"this is one of the many ultimate college student foods. its easy to make, requires almost no external ingredients and comes with its own bowl so even if you live in a dorm you don't need any flatware."
4,Bowl Appetit not too bad,"This product is super convenient, instead of having to eat an MRE for midnight chow I can cook one of these little babiesand i am good to go. Enough to fill you up and keep you satisfied for a few hours when the only thing to look forward to isanother MRE for breakfast. These are a little salty and if you don't stir it properly and add the warm water the dried saucesticks to the bottom or stays dry inside the pasta leaving it a bit crunch in some spots and a little weird tasting from gettingtoo much of the dry stuff in another. It would be fantastic with a little grilled chicken thrown in but that is hard to come by unless I buy the chicken in a packet which would make this even saltier. 3 1/2 for flavor and 4 1/2 for being handy. Recommending having at least 1 1/2 bottle of water to have to drink while eating. The price isn't too bad either"
3,heartbreaking,"seriously. i read this book last night because i will be writing a review for a periodical. i am in my twenties and i cried for several hours.the artwork is fantastic, and that alone gets three stars, but please be aware that you should read this book first to make sure that your children can handle it. a mother bear and her babies must swim for their lives in the middle of the night. the babies drown and the mother bear waits by the shore of the lake-- season after season until she eventually dies with a broken heart! sure sure, there's some after death spiritual reunion, but it wasn't enough to keep me from weeping terribly until well into the morning.i couldn't even sleep with this book in my house, so i just put it outside and will try to sleep again... eventually."
5,A beautifully written and illustrated legend,The Legend of Sleeping Bear is a book and keepsake for the entire family. It is a touching portrayal of a mother's unconditional love for her children. It also serves to tell the wonderful Indian folktale about the unique environmental characteristics of NW Michigan.
5,A touching & thoughtful book for children and adults alike.,"I was impressed by this book for many reasons and on many levels. For over 20 years our family has vacationed at Glen Lake and Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes. My children grew up hearing the legend, even adding their own little touches. Until now, there has never been a book that portrayed the legend with such eloquence and heart. You not only see and hear the story - but you feel it. I am also an elementary school librarian and I read this story to all of the 500 children in our building (grades K-4). Every child, without exception, was held spellbound with the telling and a few even shed some tears. And one teacher left the room sobbing at the recounting of the mother bear's endless love. This is truly a story for all ages."
4,Fascinating Book !,A good friend of ours got this book signed by the author for my two year old daughter. She loves hearing this story and always wants me to read it to her at bed time. I never knew the legend of the sleeping bear dunes and when I read this book I was moved with emotion. I think it is a wonderful book and is very well written !
4,Risk Analysis made easy,"I bought the book two years ago to get up to speed with risk analysis. I'll now buy it again because I had to leave the last copy with my former employer. The book is very well written, clear and concise with good worked examples so that even a non-mathematically-inclined person and statistics novice will readily grasp the basic concepts and be able to use the enclosed software CD. Very good! My one only gripe is that the demo software included with the book is limited to a ""student"" level of performance, but I guess if you get heavily into it it'll be worth to pay the extra to get the full version of the Excel add-on which runs the calculations."
5,Freakin' Faabulous!,"Great, great movie! Anyone interested in alternative lifestyles, building, living or educating themselves needs to watch this movie!Peace."
3,"It's OK, but it takes muscle.","Works as advertised, but I do not recommend this tool for cinching 1"" pipe -- it takes far too much muscle to operate the device than is reasonably possible for most."
3,Doesn't come with the cutter,It is just the clamp. I thought all of them could also cut the clamp to remove it. It's not a huge deal as I can use other tools to remove a clamp and hopefully I don't need to remove too many. It would have been nice if that point had been made clear in the write up.
5,Does the job but does take a lot of force,"Works well (at least with 1/2"" crimps and pipe) but does take some force to crimp (stainless steel crimp connections). This makes it hard to use in confined spaces without the risk of slipping and the crimp ending up in the wrong position.Unless you're built like Popeye, it's definitely a two-handed job so any loose piping/connectors will need to be secured unless you have a third hand around."
1,pitiful,dipset is the worst rappers ive ever heard in my life..they have weak lyrics and wack flow...they say the same word at the end of every line because they cant think of rhymes..terriple rap..lil jon even has better lyrics than these guys
4,"Diplomats ""Roc"" The Streets","I'm really feelin' this album..The beats are off the hook with the fresh sound of Just Blaze, also mix in a bit of throwback sampling some classic motown songs into new hits ""Lets Go"" and ""Purple Haze""..A song that screams straight hit is ""Dipset Anthem"" but the album gets alot of support from radio friendly songs like ""Hey Ma (Remix)"" and ""We Built This City""..I think it shines when they represent the hood, ""DJ Enuff Freestyle"" , ""The First""..I didn't know what to expect getting this album but The Diplomats got talent. Hook yourself up with this one.(4/5).Peace"
5,Camron puttin it down with Dip Set,"This album is hotness. Camron is back with regained hunger, and a team to put it down for NY gangstas. They spit like no one has ever done over the grimeyest beats with punishing basslines. Many of the tracks are sampled from old soul hits, and redone is a way that has never been heard of until now. the whole way the songs are composed is a totally new style, and the producers the Heat Makers have created a signature for themselves and the Diplomats on their Debut album. Its an amazing cd, id compare them to the Lox, Mobb Deep, and maybe even 3-6 Mafia for their hardcore style and flavor."
3,Beats but lack of lyrics,"Come on nah, who we fooling. Camron and the diplomats arent the lyricist that hiphop needs right now or near the level of their label mates. but thank god for Just blaze and kanye west for providing the killer beats for dipset anthem and i really mean it. Not suprised by the lack of storytelling.. if anything its a average freestyle appearance from all of them. very repetitive subject matter about Cam's pink boots and shipping of bricks. Makes e wonder..uhh never mind. overall if you a roc fan you will bob your head to the beats all day on at least 4 songs. If you a hiphop historian and a feen for deep lyrics.. stay clear!"
4,Justin's Review,"Yo, dis justin from the Chi and i wanted to say this CD is prettytight. this is the type of CD that you put in da player and just let it play. This was a double disc album and i liked the 2nd CDa little bit better. I'm out. Holla."
2,Camron has fallen Off,"O.k. Though Camrons first album ""Confessions of Fire"" was too radio friendly and commercial......he had clever word play and his own style that was later stolen by Drag-On. Anyway the beats on this album are off the hook but waisted on lame lyrics. Camron, Jim Jones, & Santana are a bunch of half [...] MC's talkin a bunch of nothin. They also could have left out the dumb interludes and skits. This should have been one disk. The stand out tracks are only stand outs because of the beats.[...]."
1,TRAILER TRASH!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is a piece of sh**. It's a double-CD with more than 20 tracks and only 3 or 4 are actually worth something. Cam'Ron's flow is ugly. Juelz Santana is alright, but everyone else sucks. Don't even waste your time or money buying this CD. If you like Roc-A-Fella artists, get College Dropout from Kanye West, Philadelphia Freeway from Freeway, Kamikaze from Twista, or any Jay-Z album."
2,Movement?? What?? Where?,"Im Not Being a ""Hater"" you retards but I feel like Dipset cant make more than one or two good songs then just fall off. They get stupid and say dumb Sh*t referring to their music as the movement, What the F*ck?? Your not some colt your a shi**y group that puts out one or two good songs and goes away and please do go away its that not its a Horrendous album but its not good, listen to Real Hip Hop people and stop having to listen to people referring to it as the movement, old Cam'Ron music is good check out S.D.E Or Confessions Of Fire."
2,They need to define themselves,"This album is decent until you listen to quality like Nas's God Son. The beats are on point but most are sampled and they all sound the same. It's gets boring after a 2 listens. The DipSet will never distinguish themselves with ""washed out"" beats and everyday rapper lyrics. You can toss this in a pile with the rest of the ROC's artist. Nothing special with this one. It's good for one listen but that's it."
3,Fine by me!!! 3.5 stars,"Well For a beginning album the diplomats deserve they props..... I like the album but I do agree that one disc would just have been good and would have made the album even better.There are many bangers on the album but the hottest is 'My Love"" im surprised only a few people said this..... Anyhow for a debut album other than mixtapes the diplomats have my respect but on the next go round less skits and one disk cuz a gurl like me hates having to get up to switch albums. And when theres one song you really love on one album but the rest are wack and the other album has all the good songs. ( kinda reminisent of Jays Blueprint 2) Anyway its a solid album. ~1~"
1,a terrible double disc album,"This CD is a joke. Boring, unoriginal rappers like Juelz Santana, Jimmy Jones, and Freekey Zeekey push a ridiculous 29 track album with song after song mocking the World trade center disaster, pushing weight, and tons of sped up R&B samples that are enough to drive anyone crazy. Cam'ron had revived his career w/ Come home with me, but this disc(s) may have sent him back to the bottom."
5,great album,dipset does it again. these people are some of the best out. they cant be touched. so all im gonna say is buy the album you will not be pissed off because you bought this album.
1,Get Off Their Bulbs,"The previous reviewer obviously doesn't know good music when he hears it. Who cares what kind of ""movement"" they are a part of? This is about their music....and their music sucks. Jim Jones, Cam'ron, Juelz, and this album in particular are pure garbage. They can't rhyme, period. And what exactly is their cause? Don't you have to have one in order to create a ""movement""? Please. This cat is has his head so far up Cam'ron's dookey chute that he wouldn't know wack raps if he was slapped with a Vanilla Ice CD.PS: Did I mention that this Dipset album sucks?Peace."
4,The Diplomats spit fire,"This is one of the better group rap albums I have seen in the past few years. The fast pace beats are matched with interesting samples...2 of which are from the O' Jays. Bottom Line: I bought this double album at the record store for 10 bucks...get it b4 the prices rise! Hot tracks Disc 1: ""Who I am"", Real Ni***s, Beautiful Noise"", ""Dipset Anthem"", And all tracks with Hell Rell. Hot Tracks Disc 2: ""My Love"", ""DJ Enuff Freestyle"", and ""Lets Go"""
1,STOP PLEASE,"Here we go again, another group made by the so called (hot rapper)in the group. I'm so tired of the group thing. A bunch of dudes dancing and rapping and wearingbig whack shirts that look like that made them. What is a dip-set, I really hate the group. First cam'ron was a player now he is this hard-thug dude with a hole bunch of d--- riders. At first cam'ron was about 6'2 235 and now he is about 5'5 103 wet. What kinda diet is he on. I think that this group should be put in prison and beat on the feet with a night stick for releasing this trash."
5,mmhmmm FIRE,"I dont know why people are hating on this album,. its nuting but good stuff,.. HEll Rell and Cam are the best lyricists in The Diplomats, Juelz is good, but hearing about how hes a gangsta and how much white he pushes gets old after the first 4 times in the first 1 song.. but god DAMN the beats are the best. they mixed the Marvyn Gaye beat. couldnt be any better this cd is def one of my favs"
2,The Streets Need It,This album is strictly for the streets. Every track on this album is hot. This is a must have cd for the summer!!!! so support tha Diplomats cause they are holdin it down.
5,HARLEM'S DIPLOMATS,"DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY, THIS ALBUM IS CRAZY!! THE FLOWS,THE BEATS, AND THE INTERLUDES ARE CRAZY!! THE FIRST DISC WAS EXCELLENT! MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE :DIPSET ANTHEM AND OF COURSE HEY MA (REMIX)!! THE SECOND DISC WAS MORE THAN EXCELLENT I DON'T EVEN THINK THERE IS A WORD TO DESCRIBE HOW CRAZY THE SECOND DISC IS!!MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE: I REALLY MEAN IT,MY LOVE,I LOVE YOU,PURPLE HAYES,THE FIRST,I'M READY, BOUT IT BOUT IT,& LET'S GO!! LET'S CUT STRAIGHT TO IT AND MAKE THIS LONG STORY SHORT DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY IS A MUST HAVE!! IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU7'RE MISSING!!"
2,Waste of time and money,"The only reason this album is worth buying is because the entire first cd is really good, and every song you can listen to. The second cd is complete crap and is one of those deals to where it just sits in the shelf and you really never listen to it again. The only songs on there I would actually listen to are Bout It Bout It, and the Hell Rell Freestyles but thats it. So you're better off just borrowing cd 1 from a friend then buying this"
5,Diplomats numba 1 fan,"This is tha hottest cd that have been on Tha Roc The Diplomats is doing it for tha 03 tracks like What Really Good ft.DMX and I Really Mean It is the Illest tracks on the double cd both of the cds is tightest out tha Roc big ups to Camron and the diplomats fam the cd is hot go get it dis ya boy outta Milwaukee,WI reppin to tha fullest Whats really good Holla back!"
1,please put an end to this music!!!,"If you really listened to this CD, you know as well as I do that these guys have no real skillz. There is nothing about this CD that is good. Cam'ron is doing too much with this whole Diplomats thing. I'm not a hater when it comes to Hip-hop, but seriously these guys got to give it a rest. Julez Santana's skillz are nothing less than a joke. This CD proves that anyone can make it in the buisness sometimes. Its really hard to believe that at one time that guy was unsigned hype. Thtas definitley where he should have stayed. Please put an end to this and do not support this group in any way."
3,Whats Really Good! Is it this album?,"The Diplomats would be a better album if it didn't span 2 discs, have so many unecessary interludes, and so many throwaway tracks which are just fillers for the album. Diplomatic Immunity can't even compare to Camron's Come Home With Me or his first two albums.There are some bangers on each disc though but nearly every song on here gets repetetive because there is some old song being sampled in it. It was cool at first but by the end of Disc 2 it started getting old.I'm just ready for another Killer Cam solo album again. If there is another Diplomats album please less skits and put it all on just one disc. That would be whats really good."
3,Solid debut from Killa Cam's crew,"Killa Cam reps Harlem, and this double disc set is pretty good. While the Roc formula now seems trite, and a double disc is excessive, the Dip Set makes the best of the situation by assemblying a solid catologue of music with gangsta talk, sped up soul sampling and post 9/11 NY hospitality. Probablly better if the album was cut down to one disc."
4,gangsta music,this is that gangsta music. beats will have your neck broken from banging it so hard. most of the lyrics go over your average listeners head. everytime I listen I pick up something new. If it was slimmed to a single cd this would have been a classic.
2,Certified ...,"I think that is by far the worst album made under the Roc-a-fella label. Cam'Ron has gon' too commercial and Jimmy Jones is just a horrible rapper. Juelz is the reason I gave this album 2 stars and some of the things he says on the album are just plain stupid. The songs I think are hot are Who Am I (Juelz Santana), More Than Music (Juelz Santana, Cam'Ron, & Jimmy Jones), Dip Set Anthem (Juelz Santana & Jimmy Jones) & My Love (Juelz Santana featuring Freeway*an artist with a hot album). I think that Juelz Santana's solo debut ""From Me to U"" is going to be the best that the Diplomats have to offer at all."
3,HARLEM HUSTLE ON WAX...,"Aight, as far as ya'll know, Harlem, NYC is the capital for hustlas (not hustlers, hustlas), period. The Diplomats, a.k.a. Dip Set, have put out countless mixtapes and cd's abut the life, the women, the money, and the struggle. On the first compliation CD, ""Diplomatic Immunity"", it's the same crew rhyming about the same things, what they do and know best. Some of the tracks are standouts, but for the most part, it can be a long ass listen (it was for me, I know that). At times, Cam'Ron's flow is basiclly finding new ways to say the same things. Out of the whole crew, Juelz is the stand-out MC. As far as the beats, they consist of flutes, a few opera chords, and hard-hitting drums to make music for the man/woman/child on the grind. Ideal for the real ones, but not for hip-hop purists."
4,DipSet Bitch!!!!!!!!!,"Well for all you dumbasses DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY is heat. Even though it is a double disc with about 27 joints on it, its still an album full of crack. The album starts off with CRACK with the first joint on the CD with Un Kasa spittin' fire over a blazin beat. There are also other tight songs like DIPSET ANTHEM, I REALL MEAN IT, BEAUTIFUL NOISE,ETC... But yea if I was anybody Id definently cop Diplomatic Immunity"
3,The First Ever Rap Comedy Album,"When i first got this CD, i hated it with a passion. But one day, i listened to the second disc & i was laughing my A-- off. This may be one of the funniest CD's i've heard in years. I can't take this stuff that seriously like i did before. The stuff that they sample is so out of place & bizzare that i refuse to believe they were being serious. ""We Build This City"", ""I'm Ready"", ""Purple Haze"", with that passionate sped-up singing, & of cource, my personal favorite on both discs, ""DJ ENUFF Freestyle"", with the screaming of ""MIRROR, MIRROR, MIRROR, MIRROR"" throughout the song. I won't even get into the lyrics on these discs because that would take a whole page to truly grasp lyrics like ""La piza piza, eating a piece of Pizza"". Wow."
3,good start but needs more killa,"killa cam has made a good come back. this cd just needs more cam on it. julez has one 2 many tracks on it. I presonally think that cam is better than julez. if u compare the 2. cam is better. they both rap very slow, both have good lyrcis. the one thing cam has over julez. he doesn't repeat him self 3 to 4 times. if julez can come over this. he might be ranked in the top 20 best rappers. but over all this is a good cd. if u are a fan of killa and dipset family u will want to buy this cd."
3,Good debut of the Diplomats...But was weak in some areas...,"Okay, let me just point out, the diplomats are a very talented team thats for sure. However, it seems as if they overkilled Diplomatic Immunity a whole lot. There are quite a few unnecessary tracks on this album and the skits aren;t anything to funny. Some standout tracks are Who AM I, DipSet Anthem, The First, I Really Mean it, and My Love. There r a few others, but nothing really to listen 2 all the time. I can't play this CD from start to finish, thats for sure. Hey Ma Rmx comes out ok, but in the end, you sort of realize that it is a [bad] song. My recommendation for the Diplomats is that they should have just took all the best songs made and put it on one album. U may want to go out and buy it, but if your friend has it, ask him to burn a copy for u. I burned a copy for my friend and thats good enuff. Peece"
5,Dips,This is a great album i listen to this when it first came out its hot if you don't got it get it.
3,otra ves,"lya he leido el primer libro de esmeralda,""cuando era puertorriquena"" me parecio muy interesante, la segunda parte, ""casi una mujer"" tiene muchas repeticiones del primero , pero la lectura es llamativa y entretenedora, lo recomiendo"
3,fair movie,"it is a fair movie, but not at all what I was looking for. I was hoping for a movie about leopards and got a romance"
4,Good attempt; a little abbreviated.,"I read the book in my youth and had fond memories of a romance with enough conflict/tension vs passion to make it interesting. The story is a little far-fetched, but I think its focus is on the characters' developing relationship.I liked the character of Bolt in both the book and the film, eventhough he was a little stereotypical. Susan Penhaligon was well cast, I thought and Keir Dullea had the right look if a little annoying with his American accent. His character and dialogue were less passionate than those in the book. The ending was a little wooden."
5,"Think for yourself, listen to me.","This movie is hilarious, and wonderful. It has proven to me that the movie industry will be taken over by people from the midwest with a DV camera and lots of free time. You owe it to yourself to buy this movie so you can be the cool guy that introduced all your lame friends to a REAL independent movie."
4,Bucket Hat,"This movie was oh-so-amusing. My favorite part was the kid with the bucket hat who kept hitting Herman. If you're into fight scenes and people getting hurt in amusing ways, this is definitely the movie for you."
2,Sappy Stuff for High School Sophomores!,"Be forewarned. The reviews of this writer's books are effusively generous with their praise - suspiciously and undeservedly so, in my opinion.This book would probably appeal to someone in the 13- to 15-year-old age range (like ""Uncle Sean,"" ""Lance, and ""The Blind Season""). It is not for adults. It is not for those who enjoy good reading. It is poorly written, repetitive, and unsatisfying. The characters are sappy and emotional - they cry a lot. While the situations and themes created for them are serious (child abuse, bigotry towards gays, commitment in relations), the solutions are sensational, melodramatic, and ultimately unrealistic.Of the 4 books referred to, I will concede that this is probably the best of the lot -- and it would be of some interest to gay high school boys."
2,Too Sweet,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading all the positive reviews posted here. I was disappointed with the outcome. I think I would have enjoyed this book when I was younger or in high school. While very optimistic, it also came off as being too unrealistic. The two boys are very sappy and that started to irritate me towards the end. If you're looking for an easy and sappy read get this book."
5,Common Sons 101 by Kevin J. Porter,"Five Stars out of FiveCommon Sons 101 by Kevin J. PorterRonald L Donaghe claims that his Common Sons is a simple story, and I agree. But within this simplicity, he takes you back to the mid 60s and delves deeply into the human condition, taking you into the lives of two teenage boys and their romantic love story. From the beginning you will want Joel and Tom to live happily ever after, but you quickly find out that the path on which Donaghe sets this story is filled with hate-filled, narrow-minded, violent characters. Even one set of parents is scarier than Hell itself.Many sections of the book will have you holding your breath as you turn the page, convinced that a murder will bloody the scene. Common Sons is a damn fine read. I highly recommend it. A family discussion of Common Sons will make the world a much happier, safer place for us humans to live and love.www.kevinjporter.com"
4,Excellent Love Story,"A good easy read about growing up in and falling in love in rural New Mexico. The characters are complex, interesting, and easy to relate to."
5,A Story of Triumph Over Adversary,"I read ""Common Sons"" in a day. It was definitely an engaging story and it packed an emotional whallop. It would be wonderful if everyone regardless of their sexual orientation could read this story and understand the challenges same gender loving persons have to face in their quests for happiness and acceptance. Unfortunately, the same fear and ignorance that was demonstrated by some of the residents of Common New Mexico is present all over America. Countless young adults will undoubtedly face the same obstacles as they seek acceptance of who they are and assert their right to live openly without judgement from others."
3,Xmas gift,"The only thing I do not like about this product is the plastic piece that acts as a goal. It is hard for the puck to get into the goal. We just ended up taking them out, which is too bad because that is where the scorekeeper is.The air is strong though and moves the puck well."
4,Good for what it is,"This product is exactly what I hoped it would be and exactly what I ordered. Works perfectly. The only problem is that although my kids love air hockey when they see it in the arcades, this one sits dormant in our house. Maybe it's not big enough, or maybe I should've gotten one on legs so they can stand up and play it. For whatever reason they just don't seem to play it. No fault of the unit -- it performs just as it should. Maybe they'll take to it at some point, but I was hoping they'd be more excited and look to play it more than they do."
5,Table Top Air Hockey from Buck A Ball,The Table Top Air Hockey game was shipped in a very timely manner and the packaging was excellent. The game came to us in very good condition which is important to us because we are giving it to one of our grandchildren for a Christmas present. The game is exactly what we were looking for. We also appreciated all of the communication we received from Buck A Ball about the status of our order. Buck A Ball also sent us an e-mail thanking us for our business. We won't hesitate to do business with Buck A Ball in the future. We have five grandchildren who are all involved in various sports so we will be looking at Buck A Ball when we need anything sports related.
4,Fast paced,"You can read it in one sitting, which is the best for most erotica. a lot of flash fictions string together by re-occurring characters. There's some odd repetition, but I see that the author uses this like jazz music, certain notes that come back to haunt you with a theme."
2,A slideshow of erotic tableaux,"This book reads like a series of flashes in a dark room.The sex is so fast paced that the eroticism gets lost, and the novel seems more like a slideshow of erotic tableaux, and some of them not so erotic anyway.Warning some scat scenes might be too much for those of some delicacy."
5,A must have for anyone interested in Calvin Coolidge,If you want a great breakdown on the political and personal philosophy of Calvin Coolidge this little book is a must have. Great quotes that give you a easy insight into the views of Calvin Coolidge.
2,Disappointed,"Rather than an actual history of the period, this is a huge grab bag of facts and opinions, some fascinating, others a little boring. But when the author says, on page 67-68, ""It was not some Napoleonic tyrant who authorized the bombing of Hiroshima, but a small-town lawyer, President Harry S. Truman,..."" one catches a glimpse of how Wilson's opinions influence and perhaps even alter the facts he chooses to write about. Of course one of the most amazing things about Truman's career was that he never even got a college degree, yet he was one of the wisest presidents of the twentieth century, despite what A.N. Wilson obviously thinks.So one has to ask, if Wilson can get this fact wrong, how about all the others?"
4,Tommy's Cover Album,"""Gratitude"" is Tommy's tribute album to the blues pioneers who influenced him coming up. The album is all cover tunes including Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Howling Wolf, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, John Lee Hooker, James Brown, Albert King, Wilson Picket, Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, and Sam and Dave. Virtually a who's who of American blues rock. All of the songs on this album are done very well, and Tommy gives them enough of his own style to separate them from the original versions. I am not a huge fan of all the covers he does but some of them really work well. ""44"", ""Bad Case Of Love"" ""Tulane"", ""It Serves You Right To Suffer"" and ""When My Left Eye Jumps"" are all great. I feel like he played it a little bit safe on this album choosing obvious songs instead of some more obscure material that he might have been able to take in different directions, but overall this is a solid disc for fans of electric blues."
4,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""GRATEFUL FOR TOMMY'S BLUE COVER!""","This is a good fun blues ""cover"" by Tommy Castro. It's probably the best, stick to blues CD (with some R&B) of his that I've heard. Covering everyone from a ""bluesy"" Ray Charles, to Albert King, to Howlin Wolf, to James Brown. Even finishing with a real good rendition of Buddy Guy's ""When My Left Eye Jumps"". On a personal note, one of Shaq's all-time favorites, Albert King, is covered with a surprisingly, bouncy, ""Everybody Wants To Go To Heaven."" Tommy, certainly isn't laying any new, creative, roads, into the blues world, but with the dirge, of living, practicing, blues, performers, out there, this is worth picking up while you wait for Shaq, ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", to find some new ""classic"", gems for you!"
4,Could have used an editor . . .,"If you can survive the first 30 pages or so, you may come to enjoy this somewhat overstuffed look back by Eszterhas. His warts-and-all honesty grows on the reader, and as the book picks up steam his puffed-chest braggadocio gives way to rueful reminiscences of his coming of age as a child of immigrants.The bulk of the book is war stories about wacky stars, backstabbing executives, greedy studios, wild parties, cocaine, etc.Still, against my better judgement, I came to like Eszterhas and to admire his raw ambition. What surprised me was that he's not really much of a writer. He likens himself to Faulkner and Fitzgerald, but writes like someone who dreams up concepts for blockbusters. I guess that's what screenwriters do. Still, it's hard to read about his difficult life without empathy, and there are stories, like the story of the first time his father tasted pizza, that are beautiful and moving."
3,Four stories for the price of one,"I'm a sucker for the shenanigans that accompany the genesis then acceptance and then production of a film, hollywood style, and this part of Hollywood Animal is a gripping, entertaining read. The films Barton Fink and The Player making worthy accompaniment to this book. There are however, more stories interspersed within, which I wanted out of the way, including the childhood reminscences, the fight with throat cancer and the revelations about daddy. The book has also encouraged me to revisit at least three of his films."
2,"The good, the bad, and the unlikeable","Something great came out of buying this truly mediocre book. I found another book, one that succeeds in every way this one fails. Where ""Hollywood Animal"" made me yawn, Grant Jarrett's ""More Towels,"" an irreverant memoir about Jarrett's twenty years in the music business, drew me in and made me laugh out loud. Both books are about unlikeable characters, but Jarrett is able to make you care about him. You root for him in spite of his failings as a human being and as a musician. You feel a part of his strange world and you laugh hard as he loses control of his life. And Jarrett can write. If you want to hear more of the same about Hollywood written in a style that will lull you to sleep, read ""Hollywood Animal."" If you want to read a memorable memoir written by a talented writer, try ""More Towels."""
3,The Adventures of Joe's Pimpli,"If you haven't read the book, the pimpli (private part) is referred to often. All about Joe's pimpli from childhood on.....the confused, lonely pimpli of a young immigrant child. Getting him in trouble, getting no respect. Then the more confident teen pimpli--getting some recognition finally. In Hollywood, the pimpli is out of control!!! It's a real messed-up pimpli, but thinks it deserves the attention none the less. Then finally, in the long, boring drawn out ending--the pimpli finds some peace, love & redemption. A good read overall."
5,Awesome,"frank, brutal, touching, funny. outstanding autobio that would stand alone even without the all the Hollywood stuff. No plot spoilers, but suffice to say, the whole mystery of his father is pretty damn heavy. buy it read it--a must for anyone who wants to be a screenwriter! Plus, it was the catalyst for me to finally give up smoking!"
5,Excellent!!!,"I could not put this book down. Extremely well written and very interesting. I can't imagine anyone not liking this book - oh wait -- let's see, anyone who is a friend or relative of anyone Joe speaks badly of lol. You're an outstanding writer Joe and this is a GREAT BOOK!! I'm afraid to start another book -- I know it will be a let down compared to this!!"
1,No Redeeming Value,"Don't bother buying this book; if you MUST read it, get it from the library, but be aware that there are NO admirable people in this book. In fact, it's a pretty depressing look at what I always thought Hollywood was like: the adultery; the lost children; the drugs; the alcohol. It's just a sad story about sad, lost people. I know the author prides himself on having moved back to Cleveland, to his roots; however, I don't think his presence improves Cleveland in any way. As a person of Hungarian ancestry, I'm disheartened by what he has done with his life--professionally and personally."
2,***,"Some interesting bits, some informative bits, some entertaining bits, but a lot of dull stretches, and the endless macho posturing gets really tiresome. It's always laughable to me when people like Esterhas (and John Milius and Tom Clancy and G. Gordon Liddy) who worship at the the alter of machismo assume that all who read them share their same ""code"" and will be struck with awe at their ""impressive"" feats. So it impresses Esterhas that Robert Mitchum once exercised flatulence in the face of a woman on a plane who dared ask him to stop smoking. Wow! That Robert Mitchum is such a rebel! Ooooh! Ahhhhh! Yeah, that's the type thing Esterhas admires. If you do, too, then maybe you'll like this book. I didn't."
3,Behind the scenes of the trash factory,"Eszterhas is as sleazy as they come, providing one can even believe most of what he writes. Some of his claims, especially about his sexual conquests, seem rather dubious when you look at his portrait on the back cover. With his caved-in mouth (does he have teeth?), and big, bushy beard, Eszterhas would look right at home on a street corner with all the other panhandlers. If he truly spent time between the sheets with Sharon Stone, it's more of an indictment against her complete lack of morals and taste, than it is a compliment to Eszterhas' personal appeal."
1,Too bad I had to give it one star,"We the public are to blame for people like Joe and Sharon and Sly. We pay our good money to go see their terrible movies. They laugh at us all the way to the bank.I wonder what Joe's first wife was talking about when he returned to her (for 27 seconds) and she ran through the house yelling...I won! I won! Won what? Him?Wears shorts and tank tops to meetings, sleeps with anything that moves, and doesnt speak to his old father for years. Won what Gerri? The booby prize? Take that $32,500 K a month and enjoy!"
4,prude world,If you are a prude you will not like this book. If you are not a prude you will like this book.
5,What a LIFE!,"This book should be a must-read for all people heading for Hollywood. Not only is it a success story, rags to riches, it's also a cautionary tale on life in the ""fast-lane"".Hats-off to Mr Eszterhas. He knows how to write, that's for sure. He is profound and touching, honest and deep. I fell for this guy, this true person who realized what he was and what he was becoming and had the courage to change it all.The writing is incredibly good. The paragraphs are mostly short and it helps because we jump from event to event and from time periods in Mr Eszterhas' life to another in the blink of an eye.Read this book. It should be in the ""Novel : Fiction"" section, not in the Autobiography one! It's reads like a novel but that's often what life is : better and stranger then fiction!"
2,Writing Good Content Crappy.,"I bought this book when it was first released and looked forward to reading it based on the reviews. I have to admit, the first half of the book was enjoyable and entertaining. His young life was interesting.But--the second half was horrible. I hated the details of his marriage and how he cheated on his wife with their best friend. It was excruciating to finish the book, but I thought it would have some redeeming quality. Instead, Joe moves to Ohio, of all places. And that was after he treated his wife of many years like crap by putting her through hell.I sold the book immediately after I read it. What a creep and his creepy (new) wife. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."
1,"Pretentious, Egotistical Rubbish","I must have read a different book to other reviewers.Probably the most pretentious, full of himself book I've ever read. I found myself disliking the guy the more I read - absolutely no personal insight or sense of irony.He eventually found a reason to hate his dad who'd sacrificed everything for him and manages to finish off with an entire ""woe in me"" section based around his dad and getting throat cancer.I don't think I've ever read a book by a person with so little insight into what a moron he is. Depressing, selfish and arrogant book - just awful."
4,Addictively Entertaining,"One of Hollywood's highest paid, record-breaking screenplay writers, Joe Eszterhas recounts his life. An incredible story of a boy that was born into the poverty of WWII refugee camps in Hungary who becomes a multi-millionnaire in America.Joe gives the reader rare insights into how Hollywood operates through his vivid storytelling abilities about his experiences in the Motion Picture Industry:Find out how Jennifer Beals was cast over Demi Moore for Flashdance.Learn how Joe made millions on his movie scripts, even after poor reviews and lack of production.Discover what goes on behind the scenes.Joe was truly a ""Hollywood Animal"" and this book is all about his journey there and beyond. Although over 700 pages long, a very fast read. You will be glad you got this one... ADDICTIVE."
2,Screenwriter Propaganda with Dirty Stories Attached,"Joe Eszterhas has an engaging prose style much simlilar to Bukowski in content as well as sentence structure. The book reads quickly so do not be daunted by its 730 plus pages. However, Eszterhas complains constantly how he has been bullied, manipulated and dumped upon while in the self reflective moments he shows he can give as much as he takes. He takes pride in claiming he is a family man with family values but shows how he deliberately alienates family members, frequently uses drugs and drinks, smokes and cheats on his wife to excess. The man is full of hyperbole and self/moral contradiction. If I have learned anything from this book it is that perhaps I still have time to reincarnate myself as a screenwriter as most of the dilemmas he depicts in achieving career success do not involve issues with writing only ego wrestling. I liked the book but not more than average."
4,Better Than The Kensington With Rubber Pad,"I own this gel footrest and the identical footrest with a rubber pad. I'll use the gel one for home where I'm in socks and the rubber one for work with shoes.The gel pad is slippery, which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Not sure if that can be improved or not.Even though the gel pad is slippery, it is much better than the rubber pad based on the fact that it doesn't smell. The rubber padded one smelled so bad I had to leave it in the garage for days before I could use it. Who wants to put their feet on something that smells like that?This has every adjustable feature you could want for a foot rest. Although it's possible to bump the part of the footrest that locks the angle in place, it hasn't happened to me yet."
2,Breaks easily,"The footrest came and the lock was broken within minutes of setting it up, luckily it was easily exchanged and the new one seems to be fine. The directions are not very user-friendly, it takes a little decoding to figure out how to adjust the height. Overall, I think this product is moderate to low quality but there aren't a lot of other options without spending a lot more money."
4,Very good footrest for the money,"I bought for my wife because she had been complaining of back pain from sitting to long at her desk at work. After chatting with her about it she told me she propped her feet up on a box at work because her feet barely touched the floor. This footrest is solid and the foam material on the top is nice. The one drawback to this footrest is the instructions for adjusting the height. You pretty much have to figure it out on your own and it isn't as simple as it could be. However, once you do it the first time it is a breeze after that."
5,Exactly what I needed,"After getting cramps in my feet at work, I decided to try this footrest. It's very uncomfortable, fits well under the desk and when I can, I remove my shoes and enjoy the soft gel under my feet."
4,Guitar Classics,"This band can really take your mind away with great Guitar works throughout the whole show. The singer came up strained in trying to hit the notes in ""Tell Me What You Want"" but the interview is fun, especially if you love their hits but don't know much about the bands history (just an extra bonus). The album itself is worth hearing the guitar melodies."
3,Spend a little more money and get the 14 track 1990 Live CD instead,"Yes this review is similar to my review of the Zebra ""Slow down"" live import CD but my point is the same - why waste time and money on this when the excellent 14 track ""Zebra Live"" CD, released in 1990, is widely available used for under $20.For that reason alone I'm tempted to give this even fewer stars but I could never do that to this criminally overlooked band!!In fact the $4 used price is the ONLY plausible reason I could think of to own this. But I personally think the extra $$ spent on the 1990 CD is worth it because King Biscuit releases aren't exactly masterpieces of production and the 1990 CD sounds GREAT!!"
4,Brief but nice...,"I'd never have a bad word to say about the boys, but the disc itself left me wanting more. The sound quality is about par, but the band's playing is as tight as ever. Randy opens with a nice quick acoustic-riff intro to ""Door."" The interview is one of those must-have items for fans like myself. I'm just looking for Zebra to do another show near here!"
5,well made,"I bought these for my daughter to wear. They are well made, stylish, comfortable, she is happy with them."
4,"Good memoir, but minor issues",I enjoy Holocaust memoirs and the survivor's point of view. I feel Seren's story is compelling and very tragic what she had to endure during those hard times of Hitler's reign. What I'm most disappointed about the memoir was Marlene's epilogue. I found it to be tedious! It didn't really fit in. I didn't care hearing about Marlene's yellow bug like it was extra information that didn't need to be put into the memoir. I wanted to hear more about Seren's family did they find more surriviors? I wanted to know more about her Mother and what happened. That was the only minor let down to me. Otherwise great book to keep in my Holocaust memoir collection
2,i shouldn't be rating this like this but...,"it was a horrible event that happened to her but.. the book itself was not engaging and heart breaking like some other stories... im not saying that she shouldn't have published it but it's just that there are more Holocaust stories that makes you cry and feel the actual pain... it's only because the victim didn't really want to give all the information about her sufferings.. i don't blame her... i just think that if im reading a Holocaust story, i would really want to read it with tears in my eyes"
4,The Seamstress,"I chose this book because I have been studying the subject for many years. The strength of this lady is evident, and important for her survival. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in womens studies, Jewish history or the experience of those persecuted by the Nazis and others before, during and after WWII."
3,"Good, but could have been better",A really good editor would have helped this book alot. Sometimes people need professional writing help to telltheir story to a wide reading public.
5,A tale of courage and strength,"This was one of the most moving books I have ever read. It is the story of one woman's courage and strength during one of the most horrendous times in history. It will terrify you, make you cry, make you laugh, inspire you and fill you with hope for mankind. Definitely a must-read."
2,Not the worlds best by far....,"As a professional bartender I have to say this book does not deserve its title. It has some good anecdotes and stories along with the authors opinion of good bars in various cities. It has a smattering of drinks and some history. An okay book if you just want to set up a home bar but if you want to work as a bartender its just too lightweight. I would only recommend buying this if you were going to buy a book such as Seagrams Bartending Guide as well. In fact, buy the Seagrams book first and if you still want more maybe then you should try this book. I'll be sending my copy back for sure."
3,"Better than the average bar guide, but...","I thoroughly enjoyed most of the content in this bartending guide. It was a lot better than most of the other books on the subject, in that it includes much more than just ""how to make every drink known to man.""But, there were a couple things that bothered me. One was the sometimes, somewhat snobby attitude of the authors (they focus on a lot of fancy-schmancy bars and clubs, and do a lot of name-dropping). Another was the totally INCORRECT insistance that beer glasses and mugs be served frosted, and that all beer be served as cold as possible. They should stick to advice for serving cocktails and mixed drinks -- most craft/microbrewed beer lovers would cringe at frosted mugs and near frozen brews.If you don't mind (what I consider to be) minor short-comings, then this book would be a fine reference for the aspiring bartender."
5,Do you have it all?,"Do you have the anime and manga? Well, how about the Fanbook? It's just not an art book, it has everything. Tons of art from the anime, from pinups and magazines, as well as rough drafts. It also has character files, a story guide, original short stories, art from scenes that were never made, interviews, comments and so much more. Get it for yourself or a fan of the series. Only for age 13 and up."
5,Great for ailing senior cats,"My Molly is 18 years old and has chronic renal failure. Because of the renal failure, it is very difficult for her to maintain weight. Catsure is the only thing that does it. I recently took her to the vet and he was impressed that she had actually GAINED weight (she's always losing)! I told him about this product and he said the company that makes it has been a highly respected company with veternarians for years. And our cat LIKES it! She will eat this on days she won't eat anything at all. If you have a cat with renal failure, you know how hard it is to get them to eat. You have to try this, it's been a lifesaver!!!"
4,Good for Old skinny Cats,"I bought first bought this product from PetSmart (where it is $8 by the way) for my 15 year old cat who had been mysteriously losing weight. She loves it, but I cant give it to her too often or she stops eating it. It turns out that she is hyperthyritic and thats why she lost weight, but since shes only 5 1/2 pounds I still feed it to her a couple times a week even with her thyroid medicines working quite well. Not all cats like it though. My other cat, a 7 pound long-hair tuxedo, wont even taste it. So it depends on your cat. I would get a can from PetSmart or PetCo first to see if your animal is willing to eat it. If they are willing to eat it, it does help get needed calories and nutrition into underweight or finicky cats."
5,Amazing,"My old guy, Baxter (almost 22 and in retail failure for more than 5 years) stopped eating and drinking quite a few days ago. Couldn't get him to eat or drink much of anything. I almost brought him to the vet, then stopped because he didn't seem to be in pain and I knew the vet would recommend putting him down. Earlier today friends recommended this product. He's been lapping it up (not tons of it-but lots more than anything else I've offered him). He's keeping it down (always a problem for cats in renal failure). For days I've been keeping a death vigil, not wanting hm to be alone when he goes. This product has given me hope that he has some time left after all."
5,Awesome Watch,"The Citizen Watch is awesome. It is sleek, fashionable and keeps great time. I would recomend this watch for a special gift for any girl."
5,Very nice and my wife loves it,This is a very nice gift for my wife for her mother's day gift. The design is elegant and the eco-drive is trouble free. She really loves it.
5,I love this book!,"If you are worried about the entitlement attitude and laziness that is so prevalent today, then this book is for you. This book is all about teaching your children to become competent, independent, and hardworking adults. It talks about chore training, money and allowance, and so much more. There is a great list inside of things your kids should learn to on their own, and the approximate age at which they will be ready. The author is very smart, but also entertaining and funny. She had so many great ideas that I had never even thought of."
5,Absolutely a must-read!,"I finished this book last night. Oh, I am so blessed to have found this book while my kids are still so young. I am going to implement The Plan with my children. This book is so clearly written and after reading it, I came away with a feeling that I can totally do this. Merrilee is awesome!"
5,Excellent Book,This book has been awesome in helping me to understand my child more and learn ways to help him over come his anxiety and fears. I would highly recommend this book!
3,Decent book,"This book was somewhat helpful. Since every child is different, it's hard to know what will work and what won't. I found a few helpful tips in the book."
3,Not for me.....,"This was a good book, but wasn't really what I was looking for to help me understand my son. My son isn't really ""shy"", but sometimes struggles what to say to his peers or how to act in social settings. I think this book would be a good book for someone who truly does have a shy child. It just wasn't what I was looking for."
1,You would have a better time reading penthouse forum,"What a waste of time!. I thought this book would contain some factual information. ( it gives a fraction of a fraction of true information ) However it is nothing but a bunch of stories written by individuals. ( god only knows if their even authors ) The subjsects are from the pretty norm to the very strange. The author of this book clearly has his own identity as well as mommy and daddy issues. Everything that he writes about clearly belongs being disscussed in therepy sessions. If you like reading about disgusting sexual encounters with people that are clearly disturbed, this ones for you. If you want fact keep searching. Reader beware! don't waste your money or your time."
4,Surprisingly refreshing yet with a dash of yesteryear voice,"Chrisette Michele has a voice that cries for more lyrics. Cutting a style of her own, you can tell she has listened and studied some of the great divas along with those just a step ahead. I hear a bit of Chaka, Erica Bydu, even some Patti Austin. ""If I Had My Way"", and ""Is this the Way Love feels""..makes the cut. Diamond in the rough, Theatre in the voice. I believe if she keeps blowing you will hear more from her. A lot of control for such a young voice. Get a glass of wine, sit down and enjoy the ride."
5,Blown Away!,"This album is one of those rare gems that sneaks up from time to time. Chrisette Michele will make you believe in music again. And if you ever have the chance to see her live, do not miss out!"
4,GREAT VOICE WRONG ERA,A TRULY GIFTED SINGER AND VERY GOOD 1ST ALBUM/CD...BUT WHAT SELLSTHE MOST IS HIP HOP AND RAP AND THIS YOUNG LADYS VOCAL RANGE WOULD BE WASTED IN THAT GENRE THIS IS A VERY JAZZY SOULFUL SINGER BUT JAZZ AND R&B ARE NOW A NICHE MARKET WITH LIMITED RADIO PLAY.
4,Refreshing Sound,"I enjoyed most of the tracks on the CD. The sound is soulful and mature, especially for her age. The combined sounds of Ella Fitgerald, Sarah Vaugh, Billie Holiday, Natalie Cole, and a bit of Jill Scott and Nancy Wilson are heard throught the CD. The upbeat songs like ""Let's Rock"" are just as nice as the mellow sounds of ""If I Have My Way"". Chrisette has a promising future ahead of her. Looking forward to hearing more."
3,Just okay,"I bought this CD a few months ago and am just getting around to listening to it. I have to say that I think that Chrisette Michele is very talented and majority of these songs sound like they would be off the chain when performed Live-however, as a CD most of the songs didn't 'wow' me. Yes there are three songs I really like, but the rest just tend to blend into white noise for me. In an age where the R&B landscape are just offering the public formuliac tracks from 'artists' that would be booed from any decent church choir, Chrisette is woman that does stand out as an unique. This CD is worth you checking out to decide for yourself."
4,The Grammys are buzzing over this new artist!,"Her voice reminds me of Norah Jones & Macy Gray. Her song, ""The Best of Me"" happens to be a Top-10 Hit in the making, and look for bigger and better things for Chrissette Michele. I am totally impressed!"
4,Great Debut,"enjoyed every track ! love the jazzy delivery on some of her songs,good production,strong vocals ,what more can you ask for.....good one!"
2,A decent start,"After listening to this debut CD from this 24 year old starlet, I am filled with mixed emotions. The first one that comes to mind is of disappointment. After hearing the first two single releases: the mid tempo 'If I Have My Way', and the gorgeous 'Best of Me', I expected more than I got. These two songs were the reasons why I purchased this CD album in the first place. The rest of the CD, apart from 'Mr. Radio' (which addresses the way love is portrayed through love songs on the radio) is inoffensive and bland.But after reflection I think this is a decent start for a first CD release. It also bides well for Def Jam records, now that L.A Reid is now in charge of affairs there (in times past this kind of CD would never have surfaced on Def Jam.) I wish that Babyface had been let loose on this CD as sole producer, as his & Chrisette Michele lone effort (Best of Me, which features an excellent video) is the stand out track on her. Oh well. Roll on CD number two."
3,Very Well Written....,"But I'm truly not a fan of her voice. Her voice is very annoying but what keeps me hanging on is her lyrics. I loved her as a hook singer and I'm going to rate this disc as a 3 star simply because of amazing lyrics. I think with her lyrics ad Amy Winehouses' voice, this Cd would be a masterpiece. :)"
5,Def Jam has a Winner!,"This girl is so amazing. Every track on the cd is the Bomb! My favs are Golden, Good Girl, In This for you, Is this the way love feels, et.al. There's not a bad track on the CD. I guess when you're in the company of LA Reid and Babyface, where can a girl go wrong? This is the only CD I'm listening to now, and I'm advising all my friends and family not to sleep on Chrisette. She was here in Detroit for a free concert over the weekend of June 22nd, and I missed her because of a family wedding. Never again!"
4,Promising start,"By this soulful and talented singer. While we've heard of the name a few times most notably on a few Jay-Z songs. I am brings her to the spotlight and with some solid results. If u give this cd a few listens i truly believe you will enjoy what Chrisette has to offer to the music world. So do yourself a solid and check out I Am by this talented, young female singer with more soul than some folks can shake a stick at. You go Chrisette, you have a new fan in me."
3,Decent CD,"Girlfriend can sing no doubt. But to me her voice is a hate or love it thing and I'm leaning towards hating it. Certain songs are great, but then some are just plain annoying. I really wanted to love this one, especially with all the hype surrounding it. I love her on Lost Ones, but I guess some things are better in small portions.The songs seemed all over the place to me, so I can't really tell what her ""style"" is. It's like they tried to have her do a lil bit of everything like a sampler platter. LOL, I'm cool. I have put this CD aside for Lina and Erykah Badu for now.It's not a bad CD, but I'd suggest listening to the samples or borrowing it from friend before purchasing. See if her voice is your cup of tea.Happy listening!"
5,A 1ST CLASS DEBUT!!!,"I CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS HOW TAKEN I AM WITH THIS SINGER, AND I DON'T USE THE TERM LOOSELY, THIS LADY IS BAD!!!! THINK A CROSS BETWEEN JILL SCOTT,BILLIE HOLLIDAY, & BADU WHILE STILL BEING CHRISETTE.SHE PROBABLY WON'T REACH HER AGE DEMOGRAPHICS BUT FOR US 30 & OVER LISTENERS SHE'S RIGHT ON TIME!!"
5,Big Mike63,WOW!!!!! This young lady has a fresh voice. One of the few new artist today that has a true singing voice. Her song selections are made for her she really can blow!I was very impressed with her style and range. Can't wait to see what her sophmore album is like.
4,Good Solid Listen,"This album is a good listen. There are a few songs that are on repeat on my IPOD. I love her voice and tone; not too heavy, not too soft--perfect blend. I would recommend this album for easy listening after a long day."
5,Beautiful Chrisette,"She can sing and she looks good. What a combination. Saw her on the video and I couldn't take my eyes away. Then I listened to the disc and all I can say is, ""Girl, God's been good to you."""
5,off the hook cd.,"Dear Chrisette I have listen to your cd 55x i put it on when i get up in the morning all the songs are my best.this is what the world have been whating for,ive never been to a concert but if you come to philly send me a E-mail and i will be there no dout.love your fan for lifemrs.Denise tatefrom Philly,pa.your the second artist i wrote the first one was Anita Baker and she sent me some information in the mail and i still have it ,she is great also.stay on this track don't let fame change who you are."
4,Album Full of Class,"Chrisette Michele is a breath of fresh air to come out with quality meaningful music. She came out with her first single ""If I had My Way"" and its talking about taking a relationship to the next level with a person and she went about the song concept in a classy way. Many different artists would've gotton to the point in a more tacky way and I respect her for that. The next single ""Best of Me"" was about her dealing with losing love but finding the better part of herself to move on from the situation. After hearing both singles, I knew I needed to give her album a listen and I'm glad I made the purchase. I wasn't disappointed and I would recommend it to anyone that's interested in listening to ""real"" music with a soul, jazzy, blues feel. Other joints to check out is ""Golden"", ""Mr.Radio"", and ""Is this the Way Love's Supposed to Feel""."
5,The best album,"This album is great! I can't stop listening to it. Sometimes when you buy an album, you only like one or two songs. I love all of them. My favorite songs are If I had my way (I thought this would be the only song I liked) now my favorite is Be okay. Mr. Radio is good too! I reccommend everyone buy this album!"
5,A REAL singer!,"Completely amazing CD! I am totally mesmerized by it! To those real fans of Erica Badu, Chaka Khan, DO NOT SLEEP on this one."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"Simply put.... I LOVE this album. Honestly, I'd never heard of Chrisette Michele until three days ago. I was walking through a music department looking for another album and one of Chrisette's songs was being played on a monitor. I stopped in my tracks. I instantly bought the album and fell in love with it. I listen to it repeatedly. She has a very smooth, strong voice. I've become an instant fan and I can't wait til' she comes to my town."
3,I Didn't Like It,"Chrisette has a unique voice with a different type of style that takes some getting used to. I was skeptical when I heard her on the Steve Harvey show because I wasn't feeling the situation and ended up turning the station to 100.3, but I went out and got it anyway on the strength of him. It's a cool CD, just nothing like what I was expecting and I can't listen to her songs back to back because her voice begans to grate on my nerves a little. I'm still giving it a try, soI won't say don't buy it, but maybe iTune it and see what songs you like before purchasing the entire CD."
4,Got better as the season went on,"I am a huge Curb / Seinfeld fan so I was always going to enjoy season 4, as I did the previous 3 seasons. That said, I thought Ben Stiller was a poor choice as a foil for Larry David and as someone who has never watched an episode of Friends, I though David Shwimmer was perfect in this role. Things get a little corny/predictable when in the final episode, the show turns into a parody of The Producers, but then again its nice to see Larry wear his influences on his sleeve. Maybe he should also include a Woody Allen parody in a future show. Would have liked to have seen more of Richard Lewis in this series - I love the relationship that he and Larry have on this show which (so they say) mirrors their off screen friendship. Cant wait for series 5 to be available of DVD!"
5,Another funny season,"If you enjoyed the first 3 season you will enjoy this one too. Over all I would have to say it was pretty, pretty, pretty good."
4,Buy it!,"Another brilliant series. The only observation I would add is that, at least for the first four episodes, Larry seems to slip into self-parody mode, leaving you with that sinking feeling that the show might be losing steam (eg the last year/episode of Seinfeld). Maybe I'm too demanding? WRONG! By the second half Larry is back to his old self and you love the show all over again. Equilibrium restored."
2,Weakest CYE season to date,"This is my favourite comedy on television, but the 4th season was a disappointment by far. 'The Producers' storyline gets stale after the first couple episodes, it really was like they just gave up for this season and stopped trying. ""Coast mode"" as someone else described it, fits quite well.One of the things I love about CYE is that every episode is something new and different, but season 4 definitely lost that comedic magic.If the new season isn't an improvement over this, I think it's time that they call it quits. But I'm hopeful that CYE's best days are ahead.I'd say buy every other season on DVD, but skip this one."
2,I Love Larry but. . .,"This is the season that the show jumps the gefilte fish. Larry as the star of B'way's THE PRODUCERS?! Extended guest appearances by Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer can't save (and may actually contribute to) this one from being the weakest season to date. (How much deadpan dourness can a viewer take?)But even when Stiller and Schwimmer aren't around, this season is on ""coast mode."" Too much reliance on forced, unfunny variations of David's now-predictable shock-value humor. Not enough Cheryl Hines. Even Jeff seems bored/tired. If the next season's no better than this, everyone should call it a day and quit while they're still ahead of 90 percent of the junk on TV. They're entitled."
5,Love this show,Funniest comedy on TV - Larry David is a superb writer as well as an actor and the team he's assembled is great.
2,Worth buying a used copy,"I'm a CYE fan who's too cheap to buy cable, so I anxiously awaited this DVD. In fact, I'm so lame I bought it twice--once on Amazon.com, and then, because I couldn't wait for it to arrive via free Super Saver Shipping, again at a record store. (Yes, I am ashamed of this behavior.) Anyway, I'm disappointed. There's a lot of dead space in the episodes, with improvisation that isn't especially funny. The whole season feels slack. It's worth picking up a used copy, but I'm sorry I spent thirty bucks on it (twice)."
1,"yawn, snooze","dudes, what's up with this show? it's, like, not even half as funnyas seinfield was. but it looks like larry david is trying to be george AND jerry in the same character. doesn't work. i'd rather watch paint dry than suffer through this sh**. are these all the bits that didin't make the sienfeld cut???? i'm out. j."
3,Meh,"What made Larry David so amusing and appealing in season one was that his neurotic behavior and eccentricites were ones I could relate to in some way: somewhere in my experiences I could think of situations I've been in where I had the same hang-ups, complaints, or observations. It seems that in each subsequent season, he has become less funny and more of an irritating kvetch. It becomes more and more difficult to relate to, and empathize with, his character as he complains about increasingly mundane things, isolating himself further from shared experiences we all have, until he has become a bit of an annoying oddity. He has gone from being the voice of reason in a room full of self-absorbed supporting characters to the guy at the party that you just wish would stop complaining and go home. Clean up your locker at the country club, put the skewer down, don't buy the cashew raisins if you don't like them, and quit being such a nudzh."
3,Nikki Cleary,"Hey!this CD is AWESOME!!! everyone should go out and buy a copy of Nikki's new CD! My favorite song is ""1-2-3"" and also ""i'm feeling sorry for myself""....this is a must have CD for the summer...watch out Britney and christina....she is sure to blow you out of the water!!thanks!!GenevievePS. go buy it today!!!"
3,"Actually i wanted to give this CD 2 and a 1/2 stars, but there's no such option.","Okay. Nikki Cleary has a nice voice. She can sing, yes. But that doesnt mean she's talented. Because singing is the only thing she can do. She doesnt write her own songs and most of the songs on this album are cover versions. Plus, the songs on this album are a little meaningless, like Summertime Guys and Sorry of Myself, even though the tunes are really catchy.What i dont understand is, if Nikki can sing - why does she lip sync? She BLATANTLY lip synced on Nickelodeon's ""All That"" which is a kiddy version of Saturday Night Live. The mic wasnt anywhere near her mouth and she was singing. I really wonder why people dont trash her like how they trash Ashlee Simpson. Really.Anyway, back to the album. It's alright. The songs are catchy and all, but it has no substance. It's just okay. That's all."
2,nikki sounds like she is boy-crazy,"this cd has only three good songs on it. 1-2-3, You're the One That I Want and Walking on Sunshine. she has a great voice but what is up with this boy-crazed thing!!!!!?????? buy this if u are boy-crazy if not, buy thankful by kelly clarkson. she sings love type songs without sounding utterly dependant on her boyfriend"
3,Great!,"When I first heard 1-2-3, I thought- Great track! Catchy, melodic and Nikki sings well. But songs like Fish Out of Water and I miss you (Its weird that you don't notice) can go a bit overboard. If you like poppy songs like 1-2-3, I would recommend Britney Spears' Oops!... I Did it Again. The production is much better and the album's songs have much more rhythm. Plus... It's Britney!. I don't think that Nikki should have changed her name. This album would be much more successful if it had some more promotion... I mean come on Jive. Why pay so much money to record an album, then not even promote it properly??? Anyway, I heard Nikki might switch label to Sony Music USA. Good Luck Nikki/Britney Cleary"
5,Our Debt to Our Heroes,"It is frustrating at times to mention the names of men like ""Manila John"" Basilone or ""Silent Lew"" Walt in conversation, only to be met with blank stares. Sadly, America all too often forgets her heroes.The Encyclopedia of American Heroes is an excellent source for rectifying that situation. Author Bruce H. Norton, who has seen the face of battle, has put together a fine book describing thedeeds of men our nation owes a debt of gratitude to.Clearly written, this book is an ideal gift for young people and adults.Heroes are not only to be honored from afar, but are examples of courage, loyalty, dedication, honor and leadership, to name a few. This book is a fine resource for learning those lessons."
5,flag,This is a wonderful way to display your faith. The flag is economical to buy. The white is pure white. I am glad to display this flag. Thanks.
2,Meh,"This flag does not burn as easily as I would like it to. It does burn, but it takes a bit more accelerant than I was expecting. Beware! If you're looking for something to burn quicker at demonstrations look for flags that are meant for indoor use only, they're more likely to be made out of natural fibers and will go up in flames quickly!"
4,Yes,I was hesitant because of the price but I am very pleased with it after I recieved it. I would recommend it.
2,You get what you pay for,"Its thin/almost transparent on the white section and has quite a few non uniform creases. I'm not sure I would have bought it knowing how it looks. Did throw it in a dryer and iron it, but it didn't help much."
1,"Wow, what a waste of my time!","I am a senior in high school... My teacher loves this book for some WEIRD reason.. She made all kinds of hype over it and made it sound like a great book and we would love it. How wrong she was!!! I don't think one person in class liked the book, and most of us are advanced readers. At any rate, the teacher still thinks its a great book and tries to ignore the fact that nobody likes it. The storyline is boring ...its someone telling another story....when half the characters have the same name and its really hard to figure out who is doing what and who is who at times! I wish I didn't have to read this book!"
2,This novel was really complicated and a waste of my time.,"I don't understand why we (seniors) had to read Wuthering Heights in order to graduate. The book has nothing to do with us at all. The book was really complicated and the movie was worse. Why did they use the same characters over and over again. And by the way, how old was Nelly Dean anyway? This book really sucked."
5,historically accurate as well as lively,"As a middle school librarian in a county with two tribes, I am always looking for books that will model exellence for our young men and women. This is a fascinating read about a native American young woman in the early days of Hollywood. We can't afford this book yet, but it is one of three that top my list for next year's order. We have 180 feet of empty shelves."
1,James LaBrie called...,"...and this is what he said...""Excuse me, is this the singer from the band Ivory Tower? Yeah, I called to let you know that I'm taking you to court for your band stealing my band's material. Also, I'd like my voice back, and John Petrucci told me to tell you he wants his songbook back. See you in court!""Avoid!"
2,Dream Theatre Clones,"This band sounds like a bad Dream Theatre. There should be a law agains music like this. The drummer is by no means any good, and the singer has stolen every lick from James LaBrie that he could find. Save your money."
1,if i could give it negative stars....,"the worst book i have EVER read. not only is the story not consistant AT ALL, but it is also historically inaccurate. the author hides her terrible writing and characters behind clothing descriptions and designer labels. not only are the characters BEYOND shallow and empty, but they don't act or dress like city kids AT ALL. has the author ever met a high school student from nyc? i doubt it."
4,"Good, but no Twilight","Schuyler Van Alen, always the outcast at her upscale private school, suddenly finds out that she's a member of an elite ""family"" of vampires, The Blue Bloods. The Blue Bloods came to America on The Mayflower trying to escape the one thing that can kill them. For centuries they've lived in peace. But now the danger is back.This was definitely a different take on vampires. I enjoyed the story. It managed to keep my interest throughout. I really loved the way that the author took real historical events, like the disappearance of the original Roanoke colony, and made it such an intriguing part of the story. There was a period in history where people actually did equate consumption with vampirism. I thought that was a nice touch. I've heard a few different people say this was better than Twilight. I don't agree, but I did enjoy the story and look forward to the next in the series."
2,Product Placement?,"This book is over exploding with brand names, it's slightly obnoxious. I didn't really enjoy this book but the end is a bit of a ""cliffhanger"" so I half want to buy the rest of the series just to see what happens."
2,wouldnt recommend,"This is one book I wouldnt recommend. It wasnt horrible but not something i would recommend to anyone, there are way better books out there that i would rather spend my four hours on. There werent a lot of details... well I take that back there were a lot of details on what the characters wore names and designers but the book itself was pretty shallow. I also really didnt like the fact that it jumped around a bit. It was kinda confusing who they are talkin about at times."
2,Fashionistic lifestyle vs. Vampires,"When I read this book, it seemed the author was trying to get rich off of the vampire theme craze that's going on after Twilight. Thank god I didn't buy the book and instead checked it out at my local library. The story line was predictable. The style of writing was annoying and also predictable. I found the book was more about fashion than a complex, exciting and adventure filled story. I have to say that the ending's imagery was amazingly acceptable. Except, it was just too little too late. Bottom line is that I can certainly live without reading the sequels from the ""cliffhanger"" at the end of the book."
3,First let me hide under a bomb shelter and now....,"this book was okay.....It did not have an exceptional plot and nor was it exceptionally well writen, but the idea for the book was at least original. The author showed imagination, and a great command of modern fashion ideas in this novel. But i have to say that it's a little unrealistic becuse I mean vamires are totally normal, but what?!?! 15 year olds who run around town at fancy clubs drinking their brains out and sleeping with everyone in is site totaly crazzy.So what I'm trying to say is this a mediocre vampire novel and like most mediocre vampire novel's the people are pretty flat but the idea is intoxicating. I will proably read the next one in the series, and i'm not saying this is a bad book, or not worth reading, just that it's just enteraing. it's pretty much the pop music of vampire novels, but i like pop music sometimes and this book is good if you just want to leave it all behind in a vampire story."
1,Badly Written,"Could have been an intriguing premise, and the author does actually have a few original ideas about vampire lore, but WOW was it difficult to get through. I realize it's a ""young adult"" novel, but I don't think that's an excuse for bad writing. I found it SO puerile! Just plain badly written. Throwing around brand and band names in the vain attempt to lend edge or modernity to her story was a very bad idea. The modelling aspect was just ridiculous; it read more like a young girl's fantasy of what being a model would be like. The dialog is sludgy and stupid. There's no suspense; the characters are caricatures. The book reads like a 9th grade creative writing assignment which warranted--maybe--a B+. I literally had nothing new to read and had purchased this used for a quarter awhile ago, so I struggled through it. It was not worth the time. At all."
4,Great for a quick read and the series ROCKS!,"After seeing this book only received 3 1/2 stars, I decided not to buy it. My friend later recommeded the book. I loved it! I read it in an afternoon. I don't know what some of these 1 & 2 stars were for...? I thought it was a great read!"
4,blue bloods,"I am a little surprised that ""Blue Bloods"" only has an average of 3.5 stars because I loved this book. I read all types of vampire fiction, & ""Blue Bloods"" was one of the most unique takes on the matter of vampires I have read in awhile. At first, I thought that this book would just be some fluff about high society life in New York, but there is so much more to ""Blue Bloods."" I don't want to give away too much of the mystery, but there were some big shockers as to certain people's true identities, & the mythology is very interesting."
3,Hmm not as good as expected,"I liked the actually story but there is too much designer clothes descriptions that most cant even pronounce, and this club is locaterd here...I dont care, get to the story. If that stuff would have been left out it would be way better."
3,To much Bling not enough story,"This book had me bothered by how descriptive the author went into the describing the clothes and so little on her story. It was designer this, designer that, designer here, designer there and all it's intricate details to how it wrapped around the body to push up the clevage.... blah, blah, blah. Seriously? Where's the point of this story? What is this blue blood about? It took FOREVER to get this book going. Slow build up with not enough hook to keep you interested. Not enough to continue on with this series. Not for me."
4,I liked it.,"Considering what vampire books are like these days, this one is quite good. It's not my favorite, but I also didn't hate it. They plot pulled me in, and the characters are interesting. I don't like the heroine very much, but she may grow on me in the next one."
5,Vampire suprises,"Blue BloodsBlue Bloods is a great fantasy story. I loved it. I think that girls between the ages of twelve through eighteen should read it. It tells a lot friendship and romantic relationships, but it also has exciting adventure. This book is a love story , and it also shows how much friends matter. The book includes many adventures Schuyler takes on the way to her discoveries. If you enjoyed the Twilight series, you will really like Blue Bloods.By Ruby Zitzer"
3,Not exactly a blue ribbon winner,"Welcome to the privileged world of the Blue Bloods, ancient vampires who rule New York City's high society. As teenaged Schuyler Van Alen learns of her heritage, a dark force begins to stalk her.I've read several vampire books recently, some brilliant, some horrible. Blue Bloods falls squarely in the middle.The book had loads of potential--I particularly liked the author's take on vampires as fallen angels who constantly reincarnate. Sadly, vampires took a back seat to endless gushing about high-end clothing. As I am in no way fashionable, I soon tired of the incessant designer namedropping.The characters are pretty stereotypical spoiled rich kids who lead rather shallow lives. The parts that deal with vampirism are good, but I felt too much time was devoted to teenage angst.Bottom line, Blue Bloods a mildly entertaining teen melodrama set against a backdrop of vampires that, in the end, is nothing special.2.75 stars."
3,Actually 3 1/2 Stars,"The concept of this book is very interesting the Blue Bloods came over on the Mayflower they are ""immortal""but in a new way they live to 100 then are reborn then in their teens they aquire all their past memories.This was a quick read I guess all the brand names were a bit much they took up too much of the book.I will finish reading this series and am hoping it gets better.It definatly didn't live up to all the hype so far."
2,If you have time to waste.. then..,"If you have time to waste, then this is not your worst choice. It's not that boring - in fact, it's quite entertaining. But if you're looking for something serious and original, this certainly can't be one. I'd dare say; Gossip Girl + Twilight + Vampire Chronicles = Blue Bloods. This is one of the most unoriginal books I've ever read so far. And it's not even well written."
2,Blah,"This was a ""blah"" book. There wasn't any real meat to it. It was trying way too hard to be a cross between Gossip Girl and Twilight but falling way too short. It was boring and I forced myself to finish it hoping that it would get good, but of course it didn't. I would not recommend this book and I am not going to be reading any of the follow-up books. I would give it one star but I can see what the author was trying to do and I can see how it might be a good idea, it just didn't work here, but maybe the other books in the series are able to pull it off."
2,Mehh,"I'm not real impressed with this book. It seems like the author was more concerned with dropping names than character development. I also get the feeling that she made an effort with the first 3/4 of the book and then realized an impending deadline and hurried to finish the book. This book just isn't worth your time, the Twilight series was also written by an amature author but there is just no comparison between the two- if you want a good Y.A. Vampire read pick the Twilight series instead."
1,Hardly even a vampire book.,"There were pages and pages where she just listed off the details of what her characters were wearing. And if she had the time to do that, why couldn't she bother to give them actualy characterization? Schuyler and the gang were as dull and flat as dull can be. I read it because a friend made me, so it's not usually my thing. If you usually enjoy books like ""Gossip Girls"" or the ""Au Pair"" series, you might like this. I certainly didn't. If you're looking for a good vampire book for teens, try Twilight. It's utterly absorbing, with characters you can fall in love with. It has everything this did NOT. Don't waste your money. Read Twilight."
1,I struggled to get through the book,"I never thought I'd find anything worse than Vampire Diaries and Need in the paranormal romance category but low and behold, Blue Bloods is worse, much worse. For everyone who is into the whole Paris Hilton and my diamond shoes don't fit deal you might like it. Even with the series that I'm not fond of I always pick up the next book just to see if it gets better, but there's no way I'm buying the sequel. This book should be taken off store shelves and burned so people don't waste their money. There's way too many amazing books out there to ever have to resort to buying this. If you're in need of some good paranormal romance books, shoot me an email and I can recommend a bunch that are way better than Blue Bloods."
