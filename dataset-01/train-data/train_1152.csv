1,When will George bring the Laughs?,"The disappointed reaction to this book is nothing to do with religion - the sad fact is that is simply not funny and not in the least entertaining. It looks like George took all the scraps he had laying around that he hadn't put in a book and just threw them together. For a sample read the extended lists on the differences between men and women early in the book and then ask yourself how often have you heard these lines before. It's just an extended rant, and few people can bring that sort of thing off. George can't."
1,Toxic Trash,"This book is full of pure toxic venom which doesn't equate to humor. Sounds to me like George hates the world and life in general. Maybe some anger management therapy would help him to write a book that's a bit more positive, palatable, AND funny!!!"
1,Disgraceful,"This book is a disgrace. The book is very offensive to my christian faith in Jesus Christ. Now, it is Carlin's right to write this book, but it is also my right to write a negative review about it and the right of book stores to make the decision to not carry the vulgar ignorant book. I find it very funny that after writing this book, Mr. Carlin admitted himself to drug rehab. Great decision, Mr. Carlin!!!!! Go to church at the same time. In response to the man's comment that all people opposed to this book are right wingers and christians, yes I am a Christian and very proud of it and yes I am a Republican, not a right wing republican, but a republican. I hope that you all had a very merry CHRISTmas. God bless. I am praying for you, Mr. Carlin."
4,Witty humor well worth your money!,"I recommend that you buy the audio version of this book, as it is read by George Carlin, and his sarcastic tone comes across very well throughout the course of the material. Many parts of this book are obviously not intended to be funny (but rather are mere observations about life), while other parts are hysterical.By the way, I enjoyed his comments about the misuse of language, although I realize that many average people won't get these jokes--in such cases, the joke's on you. Carlin has an excellent command of the English language and it certainly shows here. These jokes are a fine example of why George has often been called ""the intelligent man's comedian."""
2,"Can we say rehash, and ripoff?","I like George Carlin, and have for years. He is consistently funny and on-point. However, this book seriously disappoints me. In the interest of brevity and good language, I'll just quote one example. The part of the book where he talks about removing body parts from yourself is taken WORD FOR WORD from his last CD/DVD, Complaints and Grievances. Don't believe me? Check out track 3 of that cd, titled You & Me (Things That Come Off Of Your Body). Notice the part in parantheses. Seriously now, if you're going to charge $25 for a slim book, at least make it original, please! Plus, when you open the book, you'll notice the interesting typeset and layout. Yes, the short anecdotes are easy to digest, but they also further reduce the content actually in the book, since there's a blank line after every two lines of text in some chapters."
3,Not his best book or material by far.,"I have always enjoyed George Carlin. I remember finding my Dads old Carlin albums and really enjoyed them. I enjoy them even more now that I understand more of the material! I enjoyed his other books, although Napalm and Silly Putty contained too much material from the last HBO or Showtime special he had done.But I don't enjoy this book. OK, thats not true. As others have mentioned, there are some really great observations, ideas and just plain awful but true thoughts that could only come from George Carlin.But the euphemisms George! Enough! I got halfway through the book and just couldn't stand it anymore. Some of the wordplay is fun, but mostly just boring after 40 pages of it.Buy it used or get it as a gift and you won't be as disappointed as if you pay full price for it.That being said, the title and the cover art are absolutely hilarious."
5,Lasts and lasts,This nailpolish lasts all week and up to 2 weeks through all the abuse I give it......it is a beautiful shade that would look good on anyone. It has been my favorite for many years....shhh...don't tell anyone...they may buy it all up.
1,Not Made in the U.S.A.,"A great jacket when it was made in the USA. All of Carhartt's products are no longer union made in the USA. This warm jacket, now leaves U.S. worker's out in the cold. I love Carhartt but how can we support a company that does not support us, like so many others. Fewer jobs here ='s high unemployment and low wages. Do not buy Carhartt."
5,Music that is actually written by the artist performing it.,"I first learnt of Sherri JAckson when she opened for Rusted Root at a concert they gave at my town. While I was listening to her I was really becoming in tune with her music. I had the chance to meet her after her set. I had her autograph my cd and I still have it nearly 13 years later. I love to listen to this cd, and one of the things that I like best about this is that it is music that is actually written by the person who is performing it. Not only that it is actually GOOD! I love Sadey and Distant Blue is one of my most favorite songs. It is what I dub a ""feel good song"". Listen to the words and you will understand what I mean."
5,"Original, fascinating and fun.","When friends come over I tell them, ""You've got to listen to this."" The lyrics are great, the music is original and it has extraordinary rhythm/percussion arrangements. Amazingly, Sherry Jackson's incredible talent is almost unknown, yet these songs have universal appeal and are among the very few that you can play over and over and hear something new every time."
3,Extremely Disappointing,"As I was expecting, the tension DID build in this installment of the Chronicles, but entirely too quickly. Yes, I did find this tale terrifying, but the rush-rush pace of the plot left ""The Stereoscope"" very unsatisfying. However, this story cannot be forgotten in the twisted web of the Chronicles because it reveals major aspects of the intriguing plot."
2,"Five down, one to go","Arghh, still the same as the other installments, but a little better written than parts one and two and on par with three and four. Now let's see how he finishes it.."
2,cheap feeling,"Given the price, I shouldn't be disappointed I guess, but the material was really cheap feeling. Running my hand across it, the material did not feel smooth and silky at all. It almost felt like plastic."
2,Feels like your highschool graduation gown.,"Before I bought this product, I read all the reveiws about how everyone hated the gown, how it was uncomfortable, and how confusing it was to tie in the back but I figured that everyone was being too picky for the price. That is, until I recieved it and now I understand what everyone else was talking about. The dress feels like you're wearing a highschool graduation gown that is too small on you, and I even ordered a size larger than my actual size and it was still tight. The fabric is unattractive, and is just mess of wrinkles. The only positive thing I would say is that the robe is alright, but if you're looking for a cheap sexy sleep outfit, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this one."
2,Looks and feels cheap,This is a classic case of getting what you pay for. Item has a stiff plasticky feel instead of feeling like silk as described. Also arrived very wrinkled. Item returned and would not recommend others purchase it.
1,Not Impressed,"I ordered this robe set in size large (which is my size) and I couldn't even get the night gown dress over my head and shoulders. The robe fit, but barely, and was very snug. I intended to buy this robe set with included night gown because I've been in need of one and so I decided to go with this one for my choice but it was not what I expected at all. Also, on both the robe and gown had pieces of thread hanging off different parts like it was quickly made or was made decent but started to fall apart due to bad craftmanship."
1,The Forgotten Consumer,"The product was to small . I wear a size 3X and that is what I ordered but when I put it on it was to small and tight so I sent it right back and never heard anything from you (the company)again. I don't think that there is anything you can do now since it has been some time ago. I think you should know and be kind enough to make me the consumer happy I feel I was done wrong and overlooked. I never received my refund or credit to my CC account. I paid alot for that outfit for my account not to be credited.Thank you sincerly,The Forgetten Consumer"
3,Runs a little tight,"Love the purple color, but runs a little tight. Nightgown is weird, but did not fit so I did not try to figure out all the straps."
2,Not impressed,The fit is all wrong around the shoulders. The robe is pretty unshapely. Material quality and stitching quality is ok.
1,uhhhhh,I love the robe... but HOW THE HECK DO YOU WORK THE NIGHTY??? I was so confused... I will prob wear it only once and then use just the robe because it feels nice. All I can say is... uuuuuuuuuh wtf.
4,Love how it feels,"I felt that the robe was under rated by most users. I know that the robe is designed for a woman, but I can attest that it fits a man quite comfortable as well."
3,Its nice,This item is nice but its not top of the line so if you dont want to spend a lot this item is good but if you have the money buy the better one.
2,cheap,"I got this for my girlfriend. It was priced cheaply, and Iknow why. It's made of flimsy nylon like a halloween costume. The seller allowed me a return, but I couldn't find packaging to send it back and figured I wasn't really out that much. I'd recommend spending a little more on something nicer."
1,Hard seller to work with,"The item was sold as a ""Robe set"". When item was recieved it was under garmet only with out robe. there was no info on how to contact seller. WILL NOT BE BUYING FROM SELLER AGAIN."
2,I thought it was longer,"It didn't look great on my body type, which is a longer torso I guess; it didn't go down long enough to cover the goods. The robe is good though."
2,Cheap and confusing,"I originally ordered two of these one red one white, I got the white one first and decided to return the red one before I received it. The ties in back are confusing and it still doesnt fit right and the fabric is cheap. Plus I didnt' think about it before hand but wouldn't you rather have matching panties than a padded hanger. I should have spent more, you pay for quality I guess. Wouldn't recommend"
2,Not impressed,"My first impression was how bold the color was, so far so good. But upon touching the material my positive impression ended. The material feels horrible. I guess you get what you pay for? I couldn't imagine that material against my skin. Secondly, the back of the nighty has this weird cross around tie thing (notice there are no pictures of the back here on Amazon?), which does make it adjustable but I thought it looked odd. In addition to that in the middle of the back on the lower back there's another tie which seems might be nice for fuller figured women but it just looks so odd. I returned it, I supposed I'll need to scout local stores so I can feel the material and see the whole thing before I buy."
1,way too short,"I'm 5'5'' and 150lbs, and ordered a large. way too short it didn't even cover my butt, I had plenty of room to wrap it around and the dress fit pretty well other than too short. If your 5'2'' or shorter this would be a nice set. I just wish they had a size chart with the length on it."
3,"Good, not great","It wasn't bad for the price, but it wasn't great either. The way the robe is made was weird but its fits good. I didn't like the fabric too much, it was way too thin."
2,Its just ok,"I don't really like it, but hey I decided to get the cheapest one I saw so u get what pay for"
2,"Very Short, Nice Hanger","This robe is extremely short. So much so that it's not much of a cover-up. However, it is pretty, and the satin quilted hanger that it comes on is almost as exciting as the garment itself. I would have liked it to be longer. The chemise or babydoll fit me very strangely, and I will not be wearing it. I've worn the robe once or twice, but would get more use out of a longer one. However, it wasn't worth returning because it was so cheap that return shipping would eat up most of the refund."
2,Cheap product,"The robe is ok, but the inside outfit was absolutely cheap. The string is hard to figure out and it's so cheap that the string broke the first time I try to put them on. It was not even sewn on properly and then later on, the second string broke. I never even get to wear them and too lazy to fix a new broken item. Unless you ABSOLUTELY love the satin robe, DON'T GET IT."
4,dreamgirl women's shalimar charmeuse babydoll with robe.,"This set was beautiful, it was for a bridal shower gift, so I hope she will enjoy the set. However, I would prefer it to be just a little heavy in the fabric, I thought it was too thin. But in all it was nice, I really like that it came with a fabric cover hanger as well, it dress up the set even more. Thank's for the affordable price."
1,poor fit,Would not purchase again the sizing chart is off. The size 40 hip is more like a 35. The ties in the back are poorly placed causing awkward bulging in the gown.
4,quite sexy!,This is a nice piece. Material is pretty good for the price. The threads and knots make it quite hot from the back. Overall I love this product!
2,bad quality,"did not fulfill my expectations, came across arruagada seems used, is disjointed and pasted.the piece is not the quality expected hope this answer detail thanks"
2,Very frustrated,"So I ignored all the previous reviews, thinking somehow I would know better. The robe is nice, no complaints with that, which is the only reason why I didn't give it one star. The babydoll on the other hand... I still have not figured out how to tie it in the back. I have purchased plenty of such items in the past, so I assumed the previous posters just did not have a clue. Wow, I was wrong and the one without a clue. This item is confusing and still sitting unused in my drawer. It would have been nice if there was atleast a picture posted somewhere so that I can try to figure this out, but there is not. I bought this as a Valentines nighty, but gave up on it and bought another item from the store that I used the black robe with instead. It is a shame that so far, it has been wasted. Maybe one day I will figure it out."
3,"Nice apparel, poor quality","Nice materials, soft to the touch, but one of the baby-doll straps got ripped without even using it, it was easy to repair, but I was expecting more product quality."
2,Robe is ok.,Uncomfortable and odd shaped. sleeves are too long and the ties in the back are a pain in the butt. :\
2,poor fit,"This robe made me look really boxy. its very very VERY short. I ordered a large, which was too large for me in the shoulders but not large enough in the waist...really strange. The material is very thin, but if the fit was good I would have kept it but it was not flattering for me at all."
3,"Robe Fine, Gown ~ eh....","The robe is fine, looks good, fits well, am pleased with this.The gown has a flaw in the front where it comes together in the v-shape center - one side is longer than the other and so it is lop sided, which doesn't give the appearance I was hoping for. So it will either have to be worn in the dark, or pitched in the trash."
3,we tried...,"Purchased this for the wife, the colour is fantastic and would appear to be exactly what the doctor ordered. We found the sizing a bit small and we returned it. Wife is 5'4"", 150lbs, small C...these are real measurements, not the BS girls like to foist upon everyone). She's a size 10/12 and this was too small. Too bad, it looked kinda nice for what it was."
5,"Great Job Terry, Another Piece of Excellent Work!!","I loved this book. Next to THE WITCHES' BREW, this was the best landover novel, Terry really did out do himself this time. I enjoyed this book the whole way through, I never wanted to put it down, and when I did, I picked it up again almost immediatly. I loved all the hardships and obsticles the characters had to face, endure, and over come throughout the course of the book. GREAT JOB!!!!!! This is a must read for anybody and everybody who has ever had a love for the spellbinding magic of a great fantasy novel."
2,Great book but...,"The hardcover edition of this is cheaper than the Kindle edition!!!!!! What is wrong with Mr Brooks!! Stand up for your readers and kick a little of the publishing savings down to us!! I will be looking for more affordable authors until then. (See Michael Manning, KC May, or Hugh Howey)."
4,Great light reading.,"It's a good read, if some entertainment and light fantasy is what you want. Fortunately its what I want, and I can say that next to Piers Anthonly's XANTH series, this is the best light fantasy series going."
5,REVIEW,I am thrilled with my purchase. it came in a timely manner and was in fantastic shape...thanks a whole lot :)
4,A moving story,"Flight to Freedom is a moving story about a young Cuban immigrant who moves to the United States without knowing any English. Her family had left Cuba because of their unjust communist leader, Fidel Castro, and had not been able to come as a whole family because their older brother had been forced to join the Cuban army. In her diary, Yara records all her joys and woes and it ends up being a great book."
1,"Skimpy, minimalist definitions and overpriced","This is the sort of book that one might expect to receive as a ""freebee"" from a drug company representative. For $..., it is very overpriced. Considering that for around the same amount of money, one can buy a very thorough medical dictionary, this ""book"" falls short. Save your money and apply it towards a ""real"" text."
4,A little hot but well worth it for speed,"I upgraded my AMD 939 socket 4400+ to this AM2 socket 6000+ CPU and I'm very satisfied with the results. You can get a better deal by overclocking a Intel chip but if you're just looking for fast, reliable, value CPU this AMD chip's the solution. The only reason I'm rating it four stars is the fact this chip runs a little hot. Using the cool n quiet function, my CPU was running at 45C at 1300 RPM on the fan. After I turned off this function on my CPU fan and set it to maximum I was able to achieve 35C at 2400 RPM. So at the cost of performance, my computer's sound went up. But I'm still very happy with the results. Highly recommend."
5,Excelent for the Price!!^_^,Very Fast!! and for the buck is the Best Choice you have! Im a AMD user since 2001
5,Good Processor,"For the price, it's a really great processor and I haven't had any problems with temperature, so I guess my stock fans are good enough. I can now multitask with no problem at all. I can listen to my music and download a movie and play a game all at the same time without having to worry about lagging or freezing up. Awesome price on this item as well, I'd recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade."
4,Great but has some problems running big games.,I bought this processor with an Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard in replacement of an AMD Athlon 3200+ and a MSI K9VGM-V thinking that finnaly I was going to be able to play at max graphics with great performance but games like C&C; III get laggy at max settings and have to run it at low-mid graphics. It's the same with portal or Oblivion. I guess that depends more on the video card than on the motherboard or processor (I have an 128 mb Nvidia GPU)Please tell me if this is unussual and I SHOULD be able to ru them perfectly.
3,Saint Saga #04.8 -- Sort of,"This review applies to the 1945 Jacobs edition alone.Very confusingly, it is (I think I'm correct in saying) not thestandard versionof ""Alias the Saint"", which contains the following three stories:The Story of a Dead ManThe Impossible CrimeThe National Debt.The Jacobs edition appears to comprise two stories only, both normally being found inFeaturing the Saint, but missing the latter's ""The Man Who Could Not Die"".The edition, then, is neither fish nor fowl, and bad value besides.Three stars for the stories.P.S. For a list of — and discussion of — all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."
3,Don't forget the yellow haired lady...,Am I the only person that remembers Marinell Madden played the yellow haired lady? She actually has the first line in the movie and is killed later on. She actually had a big part and yet is not even listed in the credits.
4,The Other Devine Miss M?,"What can I say- this movie's more fun than you might think... despite the dreadful performance by Morgan Fairchild (far from devine)!! Where are the Petticoat Junction girls when you need them? As always- Willie's cool and collected and he manages to keep a straight face whenever Ms. Fairchild dribbles her lines! Why the producers failed to cast Katharine Ross or, perhaps, the sexiest woman in the film- ""Cindy"" (Baytowns Miss Marinell Madden... who eventually offs Mr. Nelson while wearing a wonderfully campy wig!) is beyond me, but I always enjoy this movie whenever I catch it, and will long for a DVD of out takes whenever somebody sees fit! Just checking for you!"
5,a wonderful gift,my FIL wanted this movie and could not find it anywhere it was so great to find it for him and he was so surpised...
4,"A Gorgeous mosaic of soul-tickling, mind-tingling psychopop","While nearly no one has even heard of this obscure band from Hoboken, NJ, nearly everyone who finds it, falls deep in love... only to find that this is indeed the band's last record together. this is a must listen. Famous musicians everywhere beware."
2,Boring and dull,"If you're looking for a cure for insomnia, try reading this book. I almost needed to make a list of all the people involved because there were so many, especially with the same last name although not related.This book is about the true story of the brutal 1988 murder of Myra Davis, 71, who was Janet Leigh's body double and in the film ""Psycho."" Her homicide remained unsolved until investigators linked her killing with that of Jean Orlof, 60, murdered in 1998. Police arrested local handyman Kenneth Hunt, who, they believed, targeted older women."
4,Wish It Was Full Album,"Despite the very 80's sound and production, I still enjoy this ep. Though I realise it's never discussed amongst fellow Cheap Trick fans (any posts on the subject on CT's official forum are deleted straight away!)I feel TP had some good ideas on this. And in ways it pre-dates the sound bands like Mazzy Star and others of that ilk went on to 'perfect'.Living In Another World, Rainy Day and All I Need are excellent songs that I still play often on my iPod."
1,The worst ep of all time - it sucks!,"Tom Petersson must have been on drugsbig time back in the '80's when he, (1)left Cheap Trick at the height of theirpopularity, and (2) came out with thisgarbage! The so-called '18-string' basshe used on this trash is really a tripleneck fender stratocaster with five bassstrings strung through the leads. Thevocals sound like two sick cats (TP andDogmar) moaning!"
5,No Room,"the absolute best of the Samples. 'The Samples' and 'No Room' represent the bare soul of Sean in very simple terms with a strong drum beat to boot. After listening to this particular CD for months, I began to realize the simple and strong voice that broke through and just.... liked it. The down to earth feeling and strong beat make this my number one pick of all their albums (for starters). There is no 'although' to come upon, for I believe that this is the epitimeeee of The Samples.eTimmy"
3,Too short and limited,"This action rpg game is very simple. You walk around and random battle appears then you go into a 2-D side battle like street fighter with multiple monsters. I won't say too much but I was expecting something more, mainly the VARIETY of dungeons. I like when you fight how the backgrounds corrlates with the area; I was expecting 20-30+ variety. There are 4 temples and 4 areas. Temples look all the same with bunch of woods. Then you have a 'ocean' coral area, mountain with little japanese theme, dead wood area, factory and few more other themes. All and all its just NOT ENOUGH. So the adventure factor plummets very quickly. For a dungeon rpg game it has too much dialogues and puzzles, all created to cover up the main meat of the game.The rpg element is simple, and the main gameplay battle engine is simple too. Monster variety is solid. Beautiful graphics, top grade for GBA no doubt.Overall the lack of area variety is just too much to over look. Try Shining Soul 2."
3,Iggy Pop - 'The Idiot' (Virgin),"Originally released in 1977,'The Idiot' was Iggy's second solo effort.I happen to disagree with most other fan's opinion I've heard as far as this album being an Iggy Pop masterpiece.I mean,I thought it was good,but certainly not outstanding.Iggy had apparently gotten with David Bowie to work with him on this album.Tunes I thought showed the most promise were ""Sister Midnight"",""China Girl""(have always liked Iggy's version better than Bowie's anyway),""Night Clubbing"",""Tiny Girls""(nice sax solo,David)and the eight-minute long ""Mass Production"".Okay to check out for yourself when you get the chance."
5,Iggy And Ziggy,"This Was A Great Comeback Record For Iggy With Bowie As A Producer. With The Combination Of These Two Geniuses You Have A Masterpiece. "" Dum Dum Boys"" & ""Funtime"" Are Definite Standouts On This Disc. His Album ""Lust For Life"" Was A Good Follow Up."
5,Iggy's self coming out,"There has been quite some rumoring about Mr. Jones and his feeling of self-importance lately. I don't give a damn. This record is the ultimate expression of how he sees the world. It's 1977 - and that's a long time ago - and Mr. Jones and Mr. Bowie put on a show that is definitely mind-altering. This is a great album, probably the best in Mr. Pop's career, and the vinyl cries about the lack of justice, girls and huevos Iggy perceives. I certainly would not like to share his problems. But then, Iggy does not share mine. Great music, fabulous lyrix. A must-have."
5,FUNny,"I played this game for the first time when I was a child, probably around 15(ish) years ago. For many, many years it was considered my FAVORITE game. I just love it.As an adult, I was lucky enough to find it online and bought it instantly. I still love it.It's super fun for those who like party games, and games where you have to be creative (I prefer these games).However, if there is one flaw with this game, it's that it's outdated. The headlines are from the 80s or 90s (???), so if you're playing with younger people, they may not know who some of the famous people in the headlines are.But, overall, it's great."
5,This was great!,"This was long, but well worth the money. It was so pretty! Naoko is one of my favorite authors!"
5,Pluto reappears!!!,"They have a few lebien moments, so you might not like it. But that doesn't really matter to me because I love Sailor Moon no matter what. In the first chapter:The Inner scouts see two new scouts.Sailor Moon destroyed Eugiel.In the second chapter:The scouts go to a concert where the Enemy invades.In the third chapter:Death Busters attack AmyIn the fourth chapter:Sailor Pluto appears[ as Setsuna Meioh]!!"
2,slip n slide,"arrived quickly, feels great, but does not stay on the seat. Everytime I enter or exit the car the cover comes with me."
1,Seat covers,"The seat covers cannot be used. I need to return them. I bought them to give as a gift. I orderend 2 and they came in 2 different kinds of packages one in a box, one in a bag. The directions that came with them did not apply to this seat cover and I am unable to secure them with the hardware that came with them so they don't stay on the seats. My daughter was very disappointed with this gift. I feel like I bought used or recalled stuff."
2,Not as great as it should be,"My mother ordered this book for my sister's baby because she wanted a good source of Mother Goose Rhymes (every child should know them!). Unfortunately, this book does not fit the bill. The rhymes are all there, but the illustrations are definitely lacking. Some are not even colored and are too small to see. My mother was profoundly disappointed, and I was too when we saw the book. I know there's a good Mother Goose book out there. This one is not it."
5,From my childhood to my sons.,I had this book when I was a kid and spent some time trying to find it for my own son and future children. It has tons of nursery rhymes and fantastic illustrations. The hardcover and thicker pages are great when little hands get a hold of it. I was very pleased to find this book and even more happy that I found the book that 20 years ago kept me entertained and taught me how to read.
2,Not so colorful Mother Goose,"My memories of Mother Goose Rhymes are colorful. If yours are the same you might not like this book, as only every other double page is colored. The pages that are colored are beautiful. Perhaps you would enjoy coloring it yourself, as I have considered. If you have a child or grandchild who would like to share time with you coloring the pages as you read/discuss the rhymes, this is the book for you, otherwise there are many colorful alternatives available. Wish I had heeded the reviews.ccccccccc"
1,BLECH!,"I was so excited to have ordered this book, and then when it finally arrived, I was sorely disappointed. The illustrations are too scary for my 4 year old, especially the man in the moon, which I had to black out with a permanent marker. I wish I wouldn't have bought this."
4,The last chance ranch,The book had a realistic story to tell and kept my interest throughout the book. Hard to stop reading as the book was fast acting and very real.
5,1 of the best books ive ever read,When i first read the synopsis of this book i was really interested in it and it certainly lived up to my expectations i havent been able to put the book down since i started reading it. the character of sam is really well thought out he is so easy to conect with as a person and the way Jean Ure talks about his feelings towards priya are are so strong and when you find out what happens to the two of them as the book unfolds it makes you really feel for them. i would really recommend this book book if you are looking for something that is really romantic but has a slight saddness to it its great for you and what makes it even better is the way the authour brings up import issues and in some ways you can feel if you can relate to sam and priya. this is an all time classic and i urge you to go out and buy it and you to will find out how great this book really is.
5,cool,"the cd and its box was in a perfect shape, it was arrived before that the date estimated, im very happy"
1,"Poorly Organized, not very helpful","This is one of the worst travel guides that I have ever used. It is very poorly organized...I found it confusing to use. It contains a lot of information if read cover to cover but, for example, when used at a site such as the Vatican, it was useless as a guide. When I needed it to help me find a very popular spot in Vatican City, it was of no help. I only had a few days in Rome and I wanted information on which sites were ""must sees"". it was of no help here, either. Save your money and get a better guide like the Insight guide or Let's go."
2,"Rome, the dream city","I have just come home after a week in Rome. Travelled there with a backpack filled with travel books and novels about Rome. I do travel alot, and usually the Lonely Planet guides have been very helpful. But this one was not. At least not helpful to take with me when I walked around. The book has alot of information, but it is hard to find the information when you need it, the text is usually quite boring, the maps are of very little use, and the book all in all looks dull.There is one exeption though, the boxed texts can sometimes be very useful and even written with some charm. The first day I was in Rome LP's Rome followed me in my backpack, but in the evening I took it out - it was of no use when I wandered around, and I had several books so much more interesting and helpful.I really hope the next edition of the book will be better, knowing other LP books I will give it another chance.Britt Arnhild Lindland"
4,Slide On,"I purchased this CD for the single, ""Slide On"". I found that there are other cuts on the CD that are good to dance and listen to."
3,"Good cable, but hard to crimp","I found these cables hard to crimp with end bits... the X in the center core needs to be cut off first, but because of the X core, its not as flexible as other cables I've used before.I would not recommend this for crimping, rather use it for base plate install cable using the cable punch.."
4,Great,"I love the versions of ""Giants"" ""Still Water"" ""The Last Drag"" ""Streets in the Rain"" and ""Information"". Not as good as actually going to one of their shows but still worth the price of admission. Some of the acoustic versions are a little weak for my taste (""Summertime"") but still a great 2 CD set. Kenny James drumming is awesome -"
2,An interesting book about medical mistakes...,"This book is definitely not the book to buy if you are looking for a credible source on medical mistakes. However, if accuracy is not a concern, it is an interesting book to read.The book tells of countless blunders by early medical practitioners up to modern day doctors. I learned a lot of interesting about the history behind many of present medical practices. Some topics covered are medications, surgeries, and their side effects, fraudulent billing practices, negligent doctors, and unethical procedures and practices.This book is extremely sensational. It is fast to make claims and statements that are not backed up by facts. The book offers no references or citations as to where to where the data and information was gathered. There are also hundreds of grammar errors and typos."
1,Don't buy this book!!,"This book is a horribly inaccurate collection of stories. I found several mistakes well beyond just ""typos"". For example, the authors describe a normal sleep stage (Rapid eye movement sleep) as abnormal and causing ""suffering"" in patients. The case of Phineas Gage (p. 215) is also mistakenly described. The authors take advantage of the fact that most people have not taken a course in neuroanatomy or basic physiology to advance their agenda. I bought the book in the hope that it would be an important addition to my education, but was sorely disappointed. I now believe that any ""fact"" put forth by these authors should be taken with a grain of salt."
1,"Promising scope, slap dash execution","I concur with a previous viewer that many of the facts are suspect. The initial chapters show promise, including a fairly thorough treatment of thalidomide, but the rest of the book appears not have been copy edited with typos galore.I found masses of repeating paragraphs (word for word identical) in sections just a few pages away from each other - I thought my attention span was initially to blame. This is an extremely slap dash book.Lots of references to 'The Cook report' give away the author's strong connection to television and the desire to entertain over 100% factual accuracy and references."
3,a reviewers mistake..................................,"The grammar is not wrong,but is the way the English spell!.Has the first reviewer even thought of this or even aware of this?.....what curious arrogance to criticise the authors from a country that invented the language!..................."
5,"Once you hear it, you'll love it!","An exciting album from David Yazbek, brimming with energy, vitality, and intelligence. It is music that is iconoclastic, provocative, and just plain fun. The lyrics are rich with marvellous imagery and are quite thought-provoking, but also catchy. Listen to the album, and before long you'll find yourself singing ""Black Cowboys on the Beach"" --it's irresistable. And XTC fans should listen for Andy Partridge, who plays guitar and does vocals on some tracks."
4,funny as hell,"Anybody who has a poor assessment of this book must not have a funny bone in their body. Many of these stories, I have to say, for me, don't really pan out to be what I expect from ""traditional"" stories. They read almost like stand-up routines. Still, I was laughing so hard that I quickly set aside these kinds of expectations and just had fun with it. These are highly inventive, quirky stories, and, somehow, they still manage to be seeringly honest about such serious topics as politics and religion. In his later books, Novakovich does handle the structual ""story"" aspect (which he definitely knows how to do) a little better, while keeping the humor intact. But you won't necessarily find all these jokes in his later stuff, either. If you want, read his later stuff first, then come back to this one. But if Novakovich's humor, imagination, and insight happen to strike you half as much as they strike me, I wouldn't pass this one up."
2,Stories From the Former Yugoslavia,"The gentle fables in Josip Novakovich's collection occassionally work, but mostly fall flat. Most of the stories reach trite conclusions and plod along. Besides the exotic locale---the former Yugoslavia---most of the people are dull. The recent ethnic conflicts serve as a constant subtext, but is never addressed successfully. The few gems in the book (""The Address"", ""Petrol and Chocolate"", and ""The Eye of God"") display a charming sense of cultural displacement and near surreal occurences, where American culture serves as a common denominator and everyone dreams of heading West. But these gems are few and far between. Most of the work is safe and unchallenging, the types of stories literary journals love (most of the pieces appeared in respected little magazines). It's interesting that English isn't Novakovich's native language. Whereas Nabokov stretched and revealed English, Novakovich has a more subtle approach that's unengaging."
4,Solid,"This story doesn't break any new ground for the character; however, it's easily the best solo Kitty Pryde story since probably Alan Davis' stint on Excalibur. The art by Paul Smith is excellent and comes off as both classic and modern but not in any way old fashioned (although some scenes in the last chapter came across unclear). If status quo changing events can't happen to X-Men outside of the parent title(s), then a solid adventure story staying true to the character's history and personality is as good as we can ask for -- that's what this story gives us."
3,"A nice, little tale of dragons and ninja.","A lighthearted adventure about a girl and her pet dragon. A Japanese tale of anicent swords, ninja and fire breathing dragons with Kitty Pryde (X-Men's Shadow Cat) caught in the middle.Shadow & Flame revolves around Kitty Pryde and pet dragon, Lockheed as they travel to Japan to recover a kidnapped dragon. The two are quickly entangled in a mystery involving a special government agency and a clan of ninja, as an old foe from Kitty Pryde's past returns.While nothing groundbreaking, Shadow & Flame is a nice little tale of fun filled adventure. Writer, Akira Yoshida, weaves a well written story that offers up plenty of sword play, intrigue and excitement. Coupled by Paul Smith's nice looking interior artwork.Kitty Pryde: Shadow & Flame, is perfect for any X-Men or die-hard Kitty Pryde fan. This book is worth checking out, especially if you can find it for under retail as I did."
4,Nice book for begginers,"I allready had a copy of this book, but it got lost. When I found I imedately baught it. It a great book. You can eve set it uo next to you to see if you doing the positions correctly. It a very good book for some one who is begging yoga or learning abou it in general."
1,A book for beginners by beginners?,"There is some decent information in this book and ya, the spiral binder is handy. However, the photographs clearly show that these instructors don't have an understanding of asana other than just ""put your body into a position"" and call it good. Engagement, alignment, drawing in, and lengthening are vital to getting the most from asana, even for beginners, and clearly is missing in the photographs of these poses. Tara Fraser has done some nice beginner books."
4,Nice computer,"I just bought this computer from our local Military exchange. I am overall pleased with it. I live overseas and was able to quickly connect to the internet with a local ISP in minutes. I tend to run several programs at once for photo editing and custom projects, and I love that I can switch between programs with no drag time at all. The large video card has enable us to finally play MOH games that our old system couldn't support.My only issue is with all the pre-loaded stuff. I dislike Norton because it continually pops up in the middle of tasks and is as annoying as using IE.... but I won't get into that. I also don't care for the compaq organizer that pops up. However, going into add/remove programs fixes this quite easily.I also delete all the hot deals, AOL... another annoying browser/isp/pia....Overall this computer gives you alot for a decent price."
1,The second review above is obviously fake.,I hate it when the review mechanism is used as advertising space by vendors.
5,Great replacement,An item just right to replace the damaged plunger for my Waring 11JE38 Juice Extractor. It just fits and not too long as described in another review with Amazon.
1,TOO long for our model,"Although advertised to fit Waring Kitchen Classics Juice Extractor Model # 11JE38 Cat:PJE**D, it is several millimeters too long and invariably ends up hitting the grinding wheel. ( Waring lists this catalog number as fitting this machine in its parts catalog as well -it doesn't.) Its not too good getting plastic in your vegetable juice. Even with care to avoid pushing the plunger in to the hilt, one doesn't always remember that its too long. Sooner or later-in this case much too soon, the bottom breaks off rendering the plunger useless, and ending up giving you a vegetable and plastic juice cocktail. We hope that it was food grade plastic!"
3,Cheeeap.,"Very cheap material, I know it's not going to last long. It is thin and does great storage. However the one I bought at Family Dollar for [...] bucks is lasting me 3 years, was done much better and it's still half of the price."
3,Too small for most of the shoe types,DO NOT BUY if you have shoe size greater than 8 for men. A couple of inches in width and height in each of the sections would have made it far better.
5,Great space saver,I love this product. No more shoes laying on closet floor. No digging for a mate in a laundry basket where I kept the less frequently worn shoes. Shoes at a glance when I walk into my small closet. Just place shoes in pockets as you would a shoe box. My mom saw this hanging in my closet and she wants one.
4,shoe rack...ok,"good shoe rack if you have limited space, if not get a bigger better one. if you wear guy shoes u can only fit one shoe into each compartment, if you wear women's shoes i think it's easier to fit both shoes into one compartment. If in college i recommend this purchase because of limited space"
2,Thin canvas,"The shoe rack's canvas is thinner and not as sturdy as a similar shoe rack I bought at Linens and Things a few years back. As other reviewers note, one slot also does not accommodate pairs of high heels, men's shoes, or most athletic shoes. You can find similar items of higher quality and at lower prices by other brands."
2,big shoes dont fit well.,"i got this shoe organizer for my husband's closet but it can only hold 5 pairs of shoes, because the pockets are small and only 1 shoe can fit in it. i have to force his sports shoes in because he is a size 13 and also they are big and u have to force them out also. so this product is good for kids shoes or ladies shoes which a pair can fit in one pocket."
3,Good Idea But Too Small for Mens' Shoes,"Although I appreciate the design and the construction quality seems solid, the compartments are simply too small. It would work well for womens' heels, perhaps, but I have a lot of trouble fitting a pair of mens' dress shoes in one of the compartments. We are not talking Shaq-style, here: I wear a 9.5 regular. It kind of boggles the mind that they didn't add a couple inches to the compartment dimensions. It would be a great organizational tool if they did."
2,Product picture must be using midget shoes....,"I wear a size 11 (wide) shoe and the pockets in this hanging show rack are WAY to small to easily get a pair of shoes in or out of. About the only thing that fits easily into each pocket is a pair of flip-flops. Even if I put only one shoe in each pocket, the pocket isn't wide enough to easily slide in my shoes.The rack itself is nice though. Good construction, sturdy, etc. My only gripe is the sizing of the pockets. I wish I hadn't spent the money on this product."
1,Crap,I was really looking forward to getting the shoes off the floor of my closet. Then I hung it up and started to try to fit my high heel into the compartments. None of them fit. Apparently when they say that this accommodates heels they mean heels under two inches. I am really very disappointed. I am going to have to try to send it back.
3,Whitney Design 01822 10-Pocket Canvas Hanging Shoe Baf,I bought this and gave away as a gift. The person I gave it to seemed to like it. J. Hall
2,Just a Silpat with a different name,"This ""fondant work mat"" is really just a giant silpat. Anyone who has a silpat is familiar with the spongy grids inside the mat. This mat has those grids also, and therefore it leaves a grid pattern on the mat side of any fondant you roll. I'm mystified why this is being sold and marketed as a fondant work mat, when Ateco already sells the much better dark blue fondant work mat that is thin and has a solid surface."
5,excellent silicone mat for fondant work,"This mat excels in size and quality. It has metric and imperial measurements along its edges for easier sizing. In general, it does not need to be greased before rolling out fondant, but that does depend on the stickiness/moistness of the fondant itself. Do not use Exacto-style razor blade knives on silicone mats. Although they may not cut through the first time you use them, they do easily cut through silicone/fiberglass mats. To clean this mat, I usually use a hard surface cleaner plus paper towels on both sides. It is too big to fit in my sink effectively, and I have had other, smaller silicone mats get singed by contact with dishwasher heating elements in the past."
3,Would only change one thing...,"Works great. Seems like it was well made and of good quality. Doesn't move when I'm rolling and trying to work with the fondant. Nice and BIG!The only thing I don't love is that it is textured rather than smooth, so only the side I had the roller on is smooth and not the side that was on the mat. I wish I had known that. I would've purchased the silicone Ateco work mat that is all blue from another site for the same price and size, although I have noticed that one tends to move around a little while you're rolling-- they both have their pros and cons I guess.I just really could've used the option of laying my fondant on directly from the mat rather than having to drape it onto my rolling pin. Now I can't decide if I should get a longer rolling pin to do that or to just buy the cheaper, smaller wilton mat."
5,ateco work mat,"This makes all the difference in my fondant work. Plenty of space, holds the fondant well. Easy clean-up. Anyone who does advanced cale decorating needs this."
3,Quality is just ok. Shipping was super fast!,"Considering how much matcha you get, this product is probably a pretty good deal, especially if you're new to green tea and can't really taste much difference between grades. However, if you're used to a ceremonial matcha, this definitely isn't it and I would go elsewhere.I agree with the reviewer before in that the shipping from Pier Mall was superfast. I received the product in two business days!"
5,half the price in China Town,"I usually go to China town whereever I happen to be, and stock up. The product itself is fantastic, but I usually don't pay more than $9.00 for 10.58 oz. (exactly the same tea) If you don't have access to China town, then by all means, it pays to get it however you can."
4,Good tea,"I was used to buying a green tea latte pre-mix from Korea. Couldn't get it anymore, so I tried this one. I just use hot, almost boiling water and the little spoon that came with itfot the matcha. I add about a tablespoon of milk and some splenda and it is pretty good stuff."
3,"Tastes good,dissolves poorly",Many other reviewers have compared this matcha to Starbucks and I agree it has good flavor but the dissolution is very poor regardless of how you make ie hot or cold blended stirred shaken etc...I have watched them make iced green tea lattes at Starbucks and their powder dissolves even when added after the syrup milk and ice...This product just does not dissolve completely and you end up either with a layer of tea at the bottom or if you keep stirring while consuming a flim of grittness in your mouth...Yes is a bargain for the amount you get at the price and flavor.. But I would not buy again and would appreciate any suggestions as to a different matcha that dissolves completely.....
4,Great for the price,"This product was introduced by my mom and a friend of mine. I was a coffee drinker - starbucks. I have not yet gone back. Much healthier and it has the caffine as well. No headaches, yeah."
4,Good for the price,"We are avid Matcha drinkers in my house. While this Matcha is slightly lower grade of tea than what we usually buy from Malden Teas or other tea vendors, the price is very good. The taste is palatable and can be consumed without other flavorings. Overall, if one is a matcha drinker on a budget, this is a good choice."
4,Good for the price,"It's pretty decent considering the price- this is a LOT of matcha. It'll last a while. I find that it does better in blended drinks and baked goods than as a hot tea, however. When I made it hot, there would be clumps of tea that wouldn't mix and if it sat too long it'd get bitter. As a cold blended latte, however, it's great, and rivals Starbucks' green tea frappuccino."
2,Not Matcha!,This is not Matcha. It's just bad green tea powder. Might be okay to mix with something but trying to fix it like Matcha is a disaster. I threw mine away.
4,Good Tasting but Expensive,"This is a very nice tasting green tea but the price is very unreasonable. I purchased the same brand at my local supermarket for less than half the price. Besides the price being high (and it was still over-priced in my opinion even at the store) it is a very good tea.I've always preferred to add my own flavors and sweetener to my tea. I'll usually add some honey to make it taste just rate. For those looking for another alternative, I would recommend the organic bulk tea powder,All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!. It is actually one of the only teas I drink without any sweetener in it at all because how natural the flavoring tastes."
5,Good for the price!,"My husband recently purchased another ""green tea powder"" at a lower price (not through Amazon!) and we realized how much better this Matcha is. We haven't tried the really expensive brands but are content with the flavor of this one so far. It does make sense to order more than one at a time as the shipping is rather high on just one."
5,Great tea for the price,"This tea was what I was hoping for-something to cook with and add to smoothies. I don't use it to make tea, so I don't know if it is suitable for the tea connoisseur. Great tea for the price!"
3,Interesting and well photographed,"This is a nice little disc but with just a little more thought it could have been even better. The presenter has a strong Welsh accent, (no bad thing as he is talking about birds in his beloved Wales), but not everyone will follow this easily and the decision to leave off subtitles is lamentable. The episodes all start off with the same rather lengthy introduction which leads to confusion as one thinks the disc may be faulty and one is getting a repeat of the previous episode. It also gets tiresome as the episodes progress. Photography is excellent and sound more than adequate. It is available very cheaply indeed and if you like this sort of niche program and are not bothered by lack of subtitles it is a good buy. Despite being labelled zone A it is actually region free and as this disc is not on sale in Wales, or anywhere else outside North America, it can be happily purchased on line for shipment anywhere."
4,Great.............BUT,"This a wonderful series and looks great too,but.........it covers only Birds from Wales England and the Hosts accent is a little hard to get use too, well made and filmedI only wish he come over here and do another series ,"
3,Not what I expected but still a great program,Not the program I was expecting. I thought it would be David Attenbourough but it was another British dude I'd never seen before. The show is really well done and the bluray is stunning. Can't beat the price of $5.00. For any nature lover!
4,Delve into the secret lives...,"This 5-part series is a nature documentary for the whole family. Natural violence, in the form of predator vs. prey, is minimized. Although limited to one geographic area, unlike Planet Earth and Life, it still shows the fascinating lives of our feathered friends. The best element to this series is how it busts the myths about being ""free as a bird"" or ""eating like a bird""."
2,I expected it was going to be birds of the tropics and it wasn't,Only the birds native to Whales. Was booring. I wish I hadn't purchsed it. National Geograpic is much better. Don't buy it.
1,dont buy.,I have been looking for a new glove for a while. When i got it out of the package it looked like a good but when i tried it on and played one round with it it cut up my ring finger and pinky. i would never get this glove again.
3,No birds in these Rockies!,"This particular book edition copies the original text very well but does NOT include the marvelous pictures that are found in the original, 1904, edition. In this respect it was a disappointment and, we didn't see a notation to that effect prior to purchase.The original ""Birds of the Rockies"" is still referenced by notable bird book authors and is a real collectors item."
1,Music with no soul still prevails,"I had the misfortune of seeing Fat Amy once during their peak, if you could call it that. They were terrible. Void of any passion or anything that resembled it. If you like watered down, safe ""collge rock"" that sounds just like all the other carbon copy bands out there, then Fat Amy may be right up your alley. If you like music that is powerful, driven by true emotion, or god forbid just plain SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS ORIGINAL then look elsewhere. Now that their hack singer has finally made a name for himself as a semi celebrity (via a vomit inducing reality TV show) people are now talking about that band as if they were ever a big deal. They had a moderate following, I'll even go as far as to say an respected following for a local band (from Lansing mind you, not exactly New York or Chicago people), but they really didn't accomplish much. People are trying to make them out to be a big deal, which they never were. Not by a long shot."
5,Great!!,"The sawhorse is well made and sturdy, edges are a little sharp, but no big deal. If your using this product it means your using power tools, then you should be wearing some protective gear, like safty glasses, gloves and (steel toe)shoes. Just attach a 2x4 on the top of it to be able to do some blind cuts. And it also works as a handle to avoid any cuts. Or you can also wrap any sharp edges with good old fashion duct tape, just avoid any moving parts, or you will have a hard time closing the leg brace."
1,needs improvement,"these sawhorses do work but let me tell you, they are razor sharp!!!!!!!! i was using them brand new on the porch, my feet were sweating so i took off my shoes,,,, what a mistake,,, i bumped my toe on the leg and nearly cut it off, one fast trip to the hospital .. right to the bone, antibiotics and several stitches later and no walking on my foot for two days, and a return visit. This turned out to be a waste of my time and an exspence - instead of a savings by using this product.. be warned the sharp edges on this product will slice like butter."
1,Horrible Sound,Worst mic terrible quality! Save your money and spend another 100 on a mic! It sounds like something you would buy at wal-mart if you want a really good mic go with a mic around 200 to 300!
2,junk!,"I have owned my wolverine durashocks for roughly four months; they are by far the worst boots I have ever owned! When I first bought them I couldn't stop telling people how comfortable they were and ankle support they gave me. That all we out the window after the first month. My feet are in constant pain and I roll my ankle every time I hit uneven ground, the soles of the boots have tore apart from walking on stone and the pavement, and so much more! These boots are pure junk! The only reason they got two stars is because they look okay. Just bought a pair of Georgia boots to replace these jokes!"
2,Poor quality plastic,"Though it worked for me for sometime, the plastic broke on its own. Made from very poor quality plastic.Not worth the high price for the product."
3,Not as great as the other soundtracks,Pretty decent soundtrack but definitely not as good as the ones in the past. Good background music though.
4,Ten Lives of the Buddha,"I started to collect Thai paintings long before I picked up a copy of the Ten Lives of the Buddha in 1982. As a serious collector, I try to find whatever available information there is about the subject and this book has provided me with invaluable background in understanding this particular art. The masterpieces reproduced in this book represent the best of this rich and unique artistic heritage. The ten lives of the Buddha are recounted in a lively narrative style that recreates the realms of myth and legend forming a vital part of the culture of the entire Buddhist world. Jataka paintings are not only works of art in their own right but also sermons in line and color. ()"
5,magnificent,"i am very much in love with both the music and the story of the titanic, the best movie as well as theme song i've ever seen and heard. charmaigne nagar END"
5,International Super Star,"Celine Dion is one of the world's super talents! She gives every ounce of energy in all her songs. She sings and projects the story, feeling, and emotion in every word of her songs. She will be missed from the music scene. She has earn a welcome rest, Celine come back soon happy and healhty!"
5,I love this song,I love this C.D. Even though I don't have it. My friend has it and every time I go over to her house I listen to. I think it fits in real well with the movie.
4,My Professor,"Ms. Anderson was my professor in Brooklyn College, and she was great. Although I haven't read the book, I'm sure it's good stuff."
2,Not impressed,"If you have the kind of closet where the hangers only fit one way, the only way you can use this is to put it on a hanger and use it that way. It's okay for sweaters, but not strong enough for shoes. Wouldn't buy again."
4,use it with light items,"I am happy I bought this item because our closets do not have any organizers or shelves in them. So this is a cheap way to add some shelving. However, I strongly recommend using light clothes in this product because the individual shelves start to sag with too much weight placed on them. Overall, it's a good product that I still use and would buy again."
3,a touch over local prices,a touch over local pricesWe're currently processing your review and we will email you as soon as this is complete
3,Alright....,"I purchased these because of all the wonderful reviews it received on Amazon. While they are alright, I didn't find them all that extraordinary. I wish the ""shelves"" were sturdier and I wish that the velcro was wider so that it wraps tightly around the rods in my closet. Since they're not tight around the rod, they tend to swing back and forth and that bothers me. I guess I'll have to buy some velcro and adjust it myself. All in all it is a good product, it's handy and cheaper than others. I would not purchase them again though."
1,Bad design for its purchase!,"I bought this organizer because of so many raving reviews about it, but was disappointed with the item I received. It is PVC shelves not canvas! It's only good for storing t-shirt and light clothes.8/2/2010 Update: After over a year, I announced that this is the least strong closet organizer we ever purchased. The shelf is flimsy and the sweaters slide out from it. You have to push the clothes deep inside so the soft shelf can hold them. Very very bad design. We got a much stronger organizer at IKEA for less price!"
4,WILL DO THE DEED,"IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT - BUT CLOSE TO IT. I DO LIKE THIS ORGANIZER FOR SWEATERS, JEANS, ETC. I LIKE IT ENOUGH THAT I AM GOING TO ORDER TWO MORE. RECOMMEND IT!"
3,So so for storage,"The shelves are somewhat flimsey, and can only support one or two sweaters. For the amount of space the unit takes up in the closet, you might as well just put sweaters on a shelf. The unit does what it promises though, and makes the closet look neat and organized."
2,"Does not match picture, do not buy if that's what you expect",I bought the shoe/shelf unit that comes covered in nice canvas and I was very impressed with the design so I didn't bother to check the reviews on this companion product. New unit is terrible and can't bear more than light rags.
2,Aftershock.... not quite,"I bought this cd about a year ago because I wanted ""Goin Thru the Motions"" which I heard about 11 years ago thru ona my homeboys. The first time I heard that song I immediately loved it n thought that at least one other song on the cd would be halfway decent but boy was I wrong. ""Goin Thru the Motions"" is the ONLY good song on the cd... the rest I just skip... thank god I bought this cd used cuz it's not worth whatever they charge to only wind up wit one song worth listenin' to."
3,So..............So,I had purchased these flutes last year for my daughter and wanted to add to her collection from Amazon.When they arrived the box was a little dirty and old. I checked the flutes to the ones I purchased last year and they were a little different.Not sure if I would purchase them again thru Amazon.
5,Equisite,The photo does not do these pair of flutes justice. I absolutely love these toasting glasses. It is a perfect addition to my wedding toast.
1,What a piece of #*%^&,"Try cutting a 24""X24"" hole in double 5/8"" drywall! The blade came out at least 15 times. Also a jab saw should not be able to move out of it's locked postion ( it's just common sense) Lennox please take this piece of crap off the market before someone hurts themselfs, Oops to late!!!!"
5,dad's not afraid to carry this diaper bag,"Comfortable to carry with helpful pockets both inside and out, a handy changing pad, and a strong strap. We have been using it for about two months and it seems well made. I originally bought it because my husband didn't want to carry around a pink, girly diaper bag, but I like the bright orange color too and get lots of compliments on it. I would definitely recommend it. This is a little more expensive than some others, but it's something we're going to use almost daily for a long time. I think it's worth it to have something we like that will also be durable."
5,A great film!,"this is a great film and well worth seeing. A perfect example from the clasic era of movies. Joan Crawford is courted by Robert Montgomery and Clark Gable. Gable plays the self-sacrificing lover, who is more out for Joan's happiness then for his, but she eventually comes around and picks the better lover in the end Clark Gable. It's one of the best films I've seen."
5,Read it for a healthier view of yourself and others,"Crabb sets forth the idea that our deep longings for true relationship inevitably lead to pain and hurt. Attempts to avoid the pain of sorrow, disappointing relationships, or conflicts rob us of the experience of our true humanness. In reality, these circumstances can push us on to a deeper awareness of our dependency on God, which in turn frees us to love ourselves and others as fallen, not-yet-glorified human beings. Though the book is intended to assist counselors and others who facilitate change in others, it also offers many insights for anyone who is seriously interested in understanding human behavior."
5,Good paddling music,Music from the CD is on the Paddle Quest kayaking video. Melodic with strong guitar riffs.
4,A Steinberg classic,"I had this years ago on vinyl and was very pleased to find it available on CD. This was one of the bestselleing Comedy albums of its time and for the most part it holds up. It's a must have for any Steinberg fan. It will also be a great companion to the new David Steinberg memoir ""The Book of David"" from Simon and Schuster."
4,Required Book Turned out to be Great,"This book was a requirement for my Political Science class, so naturally I went in dreading it. However, I was pleasantly surprised how accessible and understandable this book was. Jonathan Wolff lays out the basics of the early theorists of political philosophy excellently. He takes every argument, states it in a very simple, easy to understand manner, and then provides the counterpoint and typically lists one critic of the idea. He does this throughout the book so the reader can make up his/her mind which side is right. Wolff does an outstanding job of staying as unbiased as one can when it comes to politics.If you are a college student as I am about to read this, don't worry, it will be a breath of fresh air in comparison to all of the other books from other classes."
4,If only the Master Cheeser would get his due!,"I absolutely adored James Blaylock's first novel ""the Elfin Ship"" and was tickled to recently discover that he wrote a sequel ""the Disappearing Dwarf"" and as I understand it a third novel ""the Stone Giant"" featuring that same lovable cheeser Jonathan Bing and his company of eccentric friends. I rushed out and purchased the Disappearing Dwarf and after reading it found that my only disappointment in it is that it wasn't longer. The fun just didn't last long enough. Now I am on a mission to secure the third volume.My love for the Elfin Ship has caused for me to yearn for a hardcover version that could hold a place of honor in my permanent collection, and now this desire extends to the whole series. Sadly, these first two books written by Blaylock were not issued in hardback. It is my sincere wish that someday someone does the world a favor and reprints these books preferably in hardback and as a boxed set"
5,YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!,"Patricia Sprinkle has done it again. MacLaren Yarbrough is a fabulous character. I have read every book in the series and each time I feel as if I am visiting an old friend. In fact, I am! The town of Hopemore and the characters that live there remind me of a small town in Georgia where I lived for three years. I am waiting with breathless anticipation for the next installment in the Yarbrough's life in Hopemore, Ga. I hope I don't have to wait too long!"
5,I found a new writer!,This is the first book I've read by Ms. Sprinkle and I found it charming. It's a delight to find a new author and realize there are many other books by her to enjoy. The characters and the marriage rings true. The writing is spectacular and the mystery works very well. Lots of false leads and fun. I recommend this most highly. They remind me of the books by the talented and sadly departed Ann George.
3,Not Quite Stellar,"I found this book to be fun to read at times, and I enjoyed learning about this interesting bird. But I found too many loose ends, where Mr. Heinrich gave up on a study before he finished it. A simple remotely controlled video camera would have helped him immensely in his study of wild ravens, but yet, he seemed to never use one and kept accidentally scaring them off. This is one scientist in need of an assistant to cover his works in progress when he has to attend other things. Several times, he mentioned studies that were ruined because he had to leave. All I can say is; I hope he gets more funding or finds someone to help him. He seems to have made some inroads in understanding ravens, it would be sad if this is all he did with his studies."
3,Mind of the Raven,"I chose this rating as there were some pages mising, otherwise it was reasonable if a little worn. Good read"
5,AMAZING READ,"This author has an ability to grab you into his world and keep you there. If you do not purchase any other book it is ok, this read is superior. You will forever look at a Raven and think of what he may be thinking!!"
3,to me not great,"I really wanted to love this book, but was often bored by the level of detail of the observations. Lay people like me expect a more National-Geographic-like discussion, talking about results and the implications more than the excruciating details of the observations and how they were acquired. Almost seemed like these details were added to stretch the material into book-length. Yet, half of the text was very interesting, and the ravens are so fascinating, that I wouldn't dissuade readers who love ravens from trying this book."
5,a great raven resource,This is one of the best raven resources I've found. The anecdotes are great and the research is complete. I very much enjoyed reading this.Word Ninja
2,Mind of the Raven,"Seller was excellent, condition of book was very good. The author may be very knowledgeable about Ravens bit I found it poorly written, boring and not very interesting. That hard to do when you know how interesting Ravens are. The book is written like a college term paper and for me totally misses how amazing these birds truly are. If you want a better understanding of Ravens look elsewhere. If you want to capture them and hang radios on them, this book is for you."
2,Just Boring,"I really tried to like this book, but after slogging through 3/4 of it I finally gave up. It was just very boring. I expected more organized research, with interesting hypotheses or at least organized conclusions. Instead this is a collection of stories that jumps around in place and time. It really don't provide any coherent picture of ravens other then that they are really cool birds. The author seems like a really nice guy ... :("
5,An Incredible Novel,"Rising is a beautiful novel which begins with young Symone, who has just gone through the loss of her mother caused by a drug overdose. Symone is adopted by the Huston's, ""a shameless family with a house at the top of the hill."" Symone starts her new life with Ridge and Madeline Huston as well as their two daughters, Audrey and Chandler. When Symone discovers that the Huston's are not the good-intentioned people she thought she knew, she escapes. As time passes, she goes back to face the demons of her past. If you want to find out more about this awesome book, check out Darnella.com."
3,Needs Work...but a good writer,As I started the title 'Rising I couldn't put it down the author wrote about pain and suffering of a little girl who is speaking in the first person...at times it was humorous and other times your heart would break for the torture the child/teen is suffering. All of sudden the storyline becomes very sloppy and becomes unrealistic...the characters and the story are underdevelped throughtout the rest of the book. I think the Darnella Ford is very talented writer but somehow she lost her focus and went too many directions. Our reading group Just For Fun - Denver unanimously agreed the story was sloppy and rushed. I will look for her upcoming title to see if she has improved her writing skills.
3,Not her best work,"Darnella Ford is one of my favorite authors! I first discovered her when I readCrave, her novel written after this one and it is a dynamite novel! However, after reading this and comparing it to her other works, I can see how much she's progressed since! The concept of this novel is good, a young mixed girl from the ghetto orphaned and then taken in by a rich white family which is no cookie-cutter family under the surface. However, instead of getting to the meat of the experience this young girl witnessed we find her at an adult going back to the scene of her horrors for the first time in many years. Therefore, readers get a lot of her thoughts about what's going to happen, blah blah blah. We learn what happened to her in like 3 pages when readers could have recieved so much more from the work had not a good portion of the book been so drawn out and dry."
5,Inspirational reading for anyone who loves nature.,"Simply put, reading this book inspired me to own my own camp in The Adirondacks!"
4,Live a rustic life vicariously -- a good read,"This book surprised me with how enjoyable a read it was. I enjoy the outdoors and camp several times a year but have had no burning desire to have a log cabin, or visit the Adirondacks, until reading this book. She knew what she wanted, made it happen and did an incredible amount of the hard labor herself. Have also read the subsequent volumes."
3,There are Woods Women and there are Posers,"I sure have known some woodswomen in my lifetime.There are actually very few of them, come to think of it.Louise Rich who wrote We Took To The Woods was one. But AnneAnne LaBastille is on the far side of the spectrum. Thisis a book by a woman who is once in awhile a woodswoman.It is a popular book. It is also not very accurate in manydetails. This is almost a Barbie Doll in the Wilderness book,But it does show that our modern world places many pressures onpublishers, authors, and still it is a good book to read."
1,Woodswoman? Not!,"Anne is a woodswoman and I'm the Queen of Sheba. Hate to burst your bubbles, but she's not the real McCoy."
3,too few songs,too few songs.. should have put several more songs on there to make it worth the money. thought it would be like the original album
3,Entertaining but .............,"It was entertaining but real short. I just hope the DVD version of ""Live By the Bay"" will be released sooner rather than later!"
2,Beautiful and Colorful Scenes + Enthusiastic Artist + The Singing and Music can hardly be heard = Bad Music DVD,"I love Jimmy's personality. The video shows he's enjoying his life and singing. His happiness spreads to me from him while I'm watching this video. However, in terms of music, this DVD is bad because of 2 reasons. First, the music and singing are drowned out by the shouting of the audience. For example, I can hardly hear he sing and the music in the first song ""Cheese burger in paradise"". Ironically, I bought this DVD after listening to that song on a CD which was recorded in a studio, not in a live show. The main purpose that I bought this is to enjoy the music not just to watch the picture. Secondly, after the first two songs, I found most of them sound very much like each other. Consequently, I became bored."
1,BEWARE-this DVD are LIVE recordings & did NOT tell you,"I detest ""live"" recordings - I can't stand to hear the audience screaming and cheering while I'm trying to listen to the music. That's why I never attend live performances - I find the audiences loud and obnoxious. If this said LIVE I would not have bought this. I ASSUMED it was ordinary music videos. NOPE! I didn't get what I bought as there is NO INDICATION this was taped LIVE. So I feel ripped off. Unfortunately I can't get my money back since I opened the package-which means I was basically ripped off. Unless you like hearing obnoxious people getting drunk and screaming and cheering, get it."
1,Anyone who needs a book wasted their money,Anyone who needs a book wasted their money buying Metal Gear Solid.Why buy it if you are gonna use a book to beat it? Talk about wasting money
4,Purpose: Teachers are needed in multi cultural schools.,"I found this book to be easy to read. It was basis in that it didn't display the school districts sides and the sides of middle class European teachers. I find this book helpful for studing techers such as myself because it gives stories of real teachers that have been successful in working with children with different backgrounds. It also can be used to help teachers that are having problems working in their multi-cultural classroom. I disagree with the author labeling students by race because children should be judge my who they are when it comes to what educational background that they need. I also wish the author described the home life of students and teachers more. Overall, the book was a good book that I reccommend others to read."
2,The book was okay I didn't follow along that well,I thought the book was a little rough on white teachers and it was bias in some ways. I think it gave some good teaching techniques that will work in some class rooms. I feel that African American students are not hard to teach and they should not be treated any differently then other students.
4,Worth reading.,"In researching ""current"" literature about reaching and teaching African American children in an urban setting, this is worth reading! Valuable insight, opinion, and ideas."
2,"Dated, weak on causes and solutions of achievement gap","Gloria Ladson-Billings needs to read No Excuses, Closing the Racial Gap in Learning by Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom. Ladson-Billings' book, Dreamkeepers, is lacking profound impact to the way we think about education and the problems faced in meeting the problems of the minority population of African-Ameican students. It is missing sufficient, current research to support causes and solutions to the achievement gap between African-American students and all other students. Frank, honest dialogue is needed to change the outcomes of the black population. Her book is just more lip service to examples of good teaching that are obvious to most educators. It is neither helpful nor thought-provoking."
4,a useful book,"The Dreamkeepers isn't a necessarily groundbreaking book, but i think white teachers (or any teachers for that matter) who haven't had much experience working with african american children will find the book helpful. If you've read any other stuff that falls under anti-racist or critical pedagogy, there won't be much that is new in terms of concepts. But what i found most useful are her sketches of the eight or so teachers who are very successful with african american children. She talks about their their upbringing, how that has influenced their teaching practices, and why they are successful in the classroom."
3,This,"The book ""Dremkeepers"" written by Gloria Ladson-Billings was not at all what I expected.I am a college student majoring in education and I had to read this book for my class.I chose this book because I thought this book was going to be about the true stories of how African American students over came the odds with the help of their ""teachers."" However, this was a book in which Billings took her own life stories and pulled out her best teachers or teachers that she felt were excellent at their career. Ms. Billings put the world in black and white and that's not it. Yes,in some cases AA children do learn differently depending on their environment,faith,cultural background and so forth but does not every child. I can sense that the author has a lot of disappointments with the education of African Americans and I can relate to her. However, the world is not Black and White and we as educators must be able to love and teach all culturals to be successful."
5,"The New Manger""s Survival Guide",This book will come in handy. I plan on opening a craft business online so I will be using this a lot
5,Excellent reading,This is a great book! I really enjoyed reading this. I recommend buying this one if you are interested in surveillance.
1,Don't Waste Your Hard-Earned Dollars...,"This thin, poorly written and edited book, provided very little serious help of any kind in my attempt to gain knowledge of this subject. Bruno repeatedly emphasizes exactly _one_ technique: buy and outfit yourself an old conversion van. Even a novice law enforcement officer could come up with a multitude of creative and common-sense techniques if equipped with even a miniscule amount of imagination.My recommendation instead? The Art of Surveillance by Kelly E. Riddle."
5,"Fun read, Great reference, For a New Knitter","I'm a new self-taught knitter and purchased this book based on the reviews. I'm glad I did as I can see it will move me beyond knitting rectangles to try shaping and socks. It is a book written as though you are having a conversation with a close, knowledgable friend sharing her talents and tales. Enjoyed the conversations while learning!"
4,Knitting Rules,"I bought this for my daugther, who is an incredible, published knit pattern maker and knitter extraordinaire. This author's blog is hilarious and this book, according to my daughter, is the best in her series."
5,Great stuff!,"Got this book for Christmas (to me, from me) and will definitely have to pick up her other books. It's been a long time since I laughed out loud while reading *anything* -- and this book kept me laughing! It also has plenty of useful information for knitters of all skill-levels -- definitely a must-have. I'd give it six stars if I could....."
5,Great Confidence Booster!,"I bought myself this book for Christmas and read it entirely yesterday. It's full of both humor and useful information for a less-confident, beginning knitter like me. I love the basic ""recipes"" for socks, scarves and hats and the way Stephanie breaks down fundamental concepts so that even I (probably) can try my hand at using those recipes to meet my needs for pattern design. As a fundamental guide, it's not all that useful, but I wasn't looking for that. I've already got a few of those. I was looking for a fun read with good information and this book is definitely it. I highly recommend it for knitters who are looking for a little nudge to try something a little more difficult than they've done in the past. It's a great motivator!"
4,A Practical Library-Builder,"The voice of Stefanie Pearl-McPhee speaks loudly through this fun sojourn into the technical side of knitting. Unlike her two previous tomes, this book includes ""recipes"" to create knitted objects. Chapters include gauge, scarves/shawls, sweaters, socks, hats, etc. I personally didn't like this book as much as ""At Knit's End"" or ""The Secret Life of a Knitter,"" because it wasn't set up like her story-telling blog. Some of the humour felt a little forced, but I still believe this book will become an essential element to my knitting library."
5,awesome as always!,The Yarn Harlot is just funny and easy to read. I love her style and her tips! Good funny book with good useful advice!
4,"Curse you, Yarn Harlot","Oh, I was so satisfied with my flat knitting and big needles. I had no interest in knitting socks or fine gauge items. But the Yarn Harlot beguiled me with her seductive descriptions of the joys of hand-knit socks, so I have rushed out and purchased miniscule needles and fine gauge yarn and struggled with the sorrows of starting my first sock six times before finally making a go of it. I hate to rip out, but she freed me to feel like I can. Now, I am hooked...not because I've got a sock done yet, mind you...but because it truly is satisfying to watch these fine pieces emerge from my needles. Now I am looking for opportunities to knit in the round (sweater bodies, sleeves...) because of the Yarn Harlot's siren call. This is a fun, breezy read, and will light a fire under your knitting self to break out into new types of projects and not to fear mistakes and to try new things. I liked this book a lot! It is practical and useful, and empowered me to believe I could do anything."
3,From a seasoned knitter,The author injects so much humor into the sometimes frustrating learning process that any novice knitter would never give up in her attempt to learn!
1,Do You Need Comedy or Solid Information?,"This is a joke book that occasionally includes useful information about knitting. If you need solutions to knitting problems, purchase The Knitting Answer Book.The Knitting Answer Book: Solutions to Every Problem You'll Ever Face; Answers to Every Question You'll Ever Ask"
4,Great Book,This is as good as if not better than her previous books. Lots of interesting knitting tips mixed in with the dry wit of her tales.
2,Problems on Kindle,"I saw an old review mentioning technical problems with the Kindle version and hoped that they had been fixed. I don't think they have. The illustrations hardly show up at all. In the sock chapter, a page says 'see box below' to explain heel construction, but there is no box.The book is still a good read and entertaining, but I'm not sure how useful the pattern parts are going to be with the graphic problems."
2,Argh...,"I'm a brand new knitter and have been trying to make up for lost time and read everything I can get my hands on. So I ordered this book. It was inexpensive and looked amusing. I can't tell you how much I disliked this book. I kept waiting for it to get better and finally gave up towards the end. I have nothing against the author, but as a new knitter I want to learn how to knit. I do NOT want to become a knit evangelist nor a neurotic yarn stasher. There seems to be a time for knitting and a time other things. I'm just really not sure why the author wrote this book."
3,"Ok, some good formulas given","I checked this out from my local library. Because of this author's popularity, the little things she says are taken for gospel and the good word spread throughout the land.Well, I think she helps to perpetuate the snobbery against man-made fibers. Her melt test goes into great detail. But really, if your house is on fire, go get the baby and leave the burning OR melting blanket behind already.Along these same lines, even though she does a great job laying out the modern landscape of knitting, i think she really goes through specific efforts to classify sister yarn crafts (aka crochet) as sort of hippy-dippy attempts that are lesser than knitting efforts (see the ""organic class of knitter"").If you like knit-centric yackity, then buy her books. They're cute. But do look for them at the library first before spending your dollars."
5,"Kind, sweet, funny, and chock full of knitting wisdom","I love Stephanie Pearl-McPhee. I always have. She's sweet, charming, and just like the rest of us. Not to mention, she is genuinely nice. She takes all of these qualities of hers and channels it into a knitting book which is not only funny but is extremely educational. I've learned things about hats and socks that I never knew (I would know more about the other things, but I'm only halfway through the book)! For instance, did you know that the length of a person's foot is roughly 15% of their height? I'll never have to measure people's feet again. She gives us all of these tricks and more in this lovely book."
5,A Wonderful Addition to Your Knitting Library!,"I really enjoyed this book. I am a relatively new knitter and only recently discovered the Yarn Harlot. When I heard she had a new book coming out I just had to get it, and I wasn't disappointed. This book is filled with her usual wit and wisdom and you will find lots of helpful information to go along with the humor. I hope the Yarn Harlot has more good books to come."
1,do not buy this book for a kindle,"The drawings disappear, and the charts are miniscule. Buy it in paper if you expect to make use of it. Talked to Amazon Kindle support unit about the problem of disappearing drawings but they were unsupportive, and placed the blame on the publisher. No ideas for how to rectify the problem."
5,PERFECTION,"I had never heard of The Samples before. 12 years after this album was released a friend told me about them. I listened to ""Autopilot"" and was hooked immediately. This music is beautiful. I have become one of their biggest fans. If you want to try them out, buy this one first, I promise you will not be disappointed."
4,Good Album but where are the old Samples?,"While Sean Kelly and the ever changing band members of the Samples produced another enjoyable album they have yet again fallen short of the music and lyrics found in their debut album The Samples. I'm still waiting for the lyrical power and musical strength of songs like Nature, Feel us Shaking, and African Ivory."
3,Not quite as good as their classic older material,"This album was their last with W.A.R.? before jumping ship to the major label MCA. Thing is, they were back to W.A.R.? after one album!This CD starts with a bang with the terrific ""As Tears Fall,"" one of the best songs they've ever recorded. The lyrics can actually make me weep which is a rarity for me. It focuses on the death of a loved one, presumably lead-Sample Sean Kelly's mother. An absolutely beautiful and haunting track.After that, unfortunately, it's down hill. None of the songs on here are outright lousy like on some of their other albums. But it seems as though after track one the magic is gone.As I've said in other reviews, the best place to start in my opinion is their earlier works such as ""No Room"" and ""The Samples."" If you like those, give this one a try as well. It's not bad, just not quite as good."
5,One of the great Joel-era MST3ks,"Good (or rather, bad) movie with great riffs. Filler segments include the Steve-O-meter, the Bot-wash and Gypsy as the Hellenistic ideal."
5,Disregard...,"Don't listen to the one-star reviewer! MST3K is one of the best shows ever, and this is a fine episode. Not the best, but good, and the movie itself is pretty entertaining, in its own bad way. It deserves more stars!!"
4,Help! I am BUGGIN OUT!,"Have you seen a John Waters movie? Wait, did you enjoy that John Waters movie. These sounds coming from this disc should be the soundtrack to that lost film of his...deranged stuff here, but gosh, darn it, you are gonna dance! well maybe not dance but flail about your home, office, car or gym. One listen to The Tammy's track and you'll know what I mean... do the bug! squish!"
1,Mislead,"I'm not sure who's fault it was, but I purchased this torpedo level through amazon and wound up with a totally different level. The one i received was also black and red, but it looked like some cheap knock off you'd find in a dollar store. TNJGREATBUYS is who sold it to me and claims Amazon had the wrong description and sku number for the product. Amazon states this is what was supplied to them. Either way, I'm stuck holding a cheap-o piece of plastic that's worth nothing to me."
3,Not my Favorite Eric Carle book,"I normally love the Eric Carle books. My son usually loves them as well. This book is not my favorite, nor is it my son's favorite. I don't feel this is a good representation of his work.The pictures are very cute and the idea is very imaginative.However, the story itself is very clunky and is a bit much for a toddler to sit through. We just look at the pictures and don't try to really read the words."
4,Super cute,I love Eric Carle. After reading this we painted clouds with shaving cream. It was a great sensory experience. Carle's books always lend themselves to great projects and themes.
3,Used Book,"Average condition for a used book and with shipping the price, the total was so, so. The delivery took weeks!"
1,Zippers do not work,"I purchased several of these to use and give as gifts. The ones I kept had zippers that went off track within the first couple of uses. If this is something you'd like to use on a regular basis, dont waste your money. I did not end up giving the others as gifts because of the poor quality. Nice concept, but did not perform as expected."
3,Not pleased with my purchase.,"I needed a storage solution for my kids' off-season clothes. I wasn't impressed. In the photos, it appears there is some support along the sides. There is not. There is no support, cardboard or otherwise. It is merely material, plastic and a zipper.Update: Purchased 12-07. It is now 5-08. When packing up the summer clothes, I had no problems. While getting the bags unpacked to switch out my children's summer clothes with winter for storage, when zipping the bags closed, carefully---not roughly--- the zippers broke on 3 of the 4 bags I purchased. I am very disappointed. Even with ""buy 3 get 1 free"" special I bought them with, (4 for around $27 @ the time), it was NOT money well spent. Amazon will not let me adjust my Star rating. I would now give it one star."
1,Just [Stuff],"This was the worst product I've used, the glue that bonds the pad to the Black Plastic part disintegrated after first use. and what is left of the glue does not hold the pad, so it fell apart during operation. the problems is I use it once every 6 months, so can't return it to Amazon. I would recommend using Orange Foam Polishing Pad from Griots Garage. this is washer prove and you should be able to wash the pad, because the wax/polish has different chemical compound.[URL]"
1,Polishing pads 54745,These pads from Tool King did not last as long as the ones I bought from CPO. Tool King were lower price ( I believe these are generic) CPO pad was more expensive but lasted the hole project by 3 to 1.CheersMaybe Nextweek
1,Terrible pad.,"Totally ripped and fell apart within the first five minutes of use. Do not purchase. A real disappointment. The Porter-Gable polisher is great, but the pad is junk."
5,These pads are the BEST but beware!,Like another user reported they do die with age. Even if you have not opened the package the foam will deteriorate and pad fall apart. You must use with in a year or so as even the new pads will fall apart after that!These pads are the best for applying wax products
4,good Pad,I use this pad with 6 inch bonnets and it works good. I have seperate ones for application and removal.
5,Great item for the price,"This is an adorable cigarette holder, in a glittery red color that matched my costume. Light to carry but not cheply made. Great value for the cost."
5,RESIDENT ALIEN cant get better !!,"Hey RESIDENT ALIEN its a hott cd ... it of the chain ... from tracks like ""Beverly Hills, ""Kiss the Sky"" and ""All Night Long"" are all tracks u can jam to.. thats what this cd is all about all songs are songs that have a sense to it and some jammin there aint 1 song in this track that u can boo ur way out and skip to the next track like u usally do with any cd that we all tend to buy ... trust me its a cd u must buy !!bye !!"
5,Simple title... cute story!,"I could hear Bill's voice the whole time I was reading the story. He has a great storytelling style that brings you right into the tale!Dianne RossbachMary O'Nette ProductionsAlbuquerque, NM"
2,Effective Support Groups,"I guess this book would help someone who has never been in a support group or, perhaps, needs help organizing his thoughts. I found it very obvious and condescending."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH!,"It is so awesome how in the future they have all that neat stuff. I really felt that I knew Jenna and Rita, and all the other characters in the book. I really loved this book. Leslie Rule Rules! She is a really great author. I read this book in 1 day!This book is so realistic, and so suspenseful. I really like the way Leslie Rule writes."
5,A great mystery,"I remember back when I read this book, it was nothing that I had anticipated it to be. I used to read mystery novels all the time from Lois Duncan and Caroline B Cooney and Joan whatever her name was etc. etc. But there was definately something special about this mystery, and I have to say it was one of the best I have ever read, because not only did it keep me up all night unable to put it down, but it really made me think.I think it's sad that this book is out of print. If Leslie Rule or her publishers read this, please try to get this book out there again! It's a GREAT read that shouldn't be missed. And Ms. Rule, I hope you write some more books someday, you definately have a gift!"
4,I hate time travel but I like this book,"I knew I would hate this book. Boy am I stupid sometimes. From the very beginning this book is captivating. The characters are so well fleshed out that you feel right off the bat like you have known them forever, particularly the main character. The setting is good and the pace is even throughout the novel. There are unexpected twists in this story that jar you a bit as you are reading, but in a good way.I was both surprised and delighted that this book was different than what i had expected, especially for middle to upper grade fiction. If you are looking for a book with a good dose of mystery, suspense and some pretty intelligent writing, this would fit the bill nicely."
4,whisper from the grave,"very good reading, not to mention that could be a reality. Its amazing that one small thing a time travel could change history."
5,Sammy,Great book. The only thing I was surprised to see was vitamin D was only given minor discussion. I know all the nutrients he discussed are important but almost everyone who doesnt supplement seems to be deficient in vt d.
4,Good source of information,"Although I do not agree with the author on all aspects of his book this has very good information on most topics, especially the toxic effects of Mercury, MSG, Vaccines and Fluoride."
5,Superb,Very detailed book covers many health issues in much details. Hundreds of studies are cited to back up claims. One of the best health books I have read. Thank you to the Author for writing this gem.
2,not what I expected,"This book is not quite what I expected. The nutritional information I hoped to find is either not there or too hard to find. The back index doesn't show what I needed to find. I am sure the doctor who wrote this book did a very good job, but it was more clinical than I had hoped. I did receive it when it was promised, however."
4,Great New Orleans Blues/Rock Band Sound,"The Radiators have been around the music scene for quite a few years, but this collection of very energetic R&B tunes is very fresh and upbeat. It has that crisp driving sound that draws the listener to meditate on the lyrics and appriciate the rhythmic instrumental solos. If you are a fan of ""southern blues"", you need to give this album a listen!"
3,Excellent recording quality and music with mediocre lyrics,"Rads fans need every recording they put out, and this one fit's nicely in the set. Ed Volkers Platonic lyrics sounded better with the hard driving sounds of Law of the Fish behind them rather than the bluesy R&B this CD offers."
4,More detail,"The shaft of this product is also texture cast to resemble leather wrap. You can't really see it in the pic, but it's a very nice effect.I wish the connection between the 2 parts of the shaft was a little sturdier, I feel it's a weak spot. Other than that it's a fine product and a great value."
1,Trash and poor playing out of tune,If they gave away prizes for the poorest this one would surely be the winner.
1,Easy Seller to Work With,"I had an issue with a dent in the table I purchased. I contacted the Seller and they submitted a claim to Fedex which was denied because I threw away the packaging. Unfortunately, I am now stuck with a brand new table and a flaw. On the upside, the seller decided to refund half of their profit for the inconvenience and gave me the benefit of the doubt. Since they came up with a good resolution, I would definitely refer anyone to them and do repeat business. The table is nice but it is smaller than I expected. If you are looking for quaint seating, this a good set. You definitely can't beat the price. Freight is a different story but that is to be expected.-KristinaRecent Customer"
2,Quacky,"Quacky is the main character. He is a kid and also an orphan. He somehow winds up on a tv show. He really wants to live with his aunt Maggie. They meet two criminals who are actually very nice. I kind of felt bad for Quacky because he had a horrible life. This is a quick, short, fun book that is just for reading when you can't find a better book."
2,Not everything fit!,The piston in the kit was bigger than the stock piston. everything else worked alright. I double checked the numbers and it was for my nailer. It just didn't fit!!
5,Excellent collection of original sources,I owned a hardcover version of this set for several years. I loved it. I wish I had thought of penciling in the date I completed an article like the reviewer from Texas. This set is engrossing. You need some discipline to keep from bouncing around for hours. Most of the articles are accessible to people with highschool trigonometry and calculus. It is great that Dover is around to pick up these works that would otherwise fade into history.
3,Great collection!,"I first came across this set long ago in grad school. It kind o' disappeared but I found it recently. Great read if you are into this sort of reading. The reason for the three stars is that for the price I paid, the condition of the book was disappointing."
3,Use this book only as a reference not to learn VoiceXML,"I was mislead by the accompanying great reviews for this book. Having bought and read the book I find that it serves more as a reference than to illustrate how VoiceXML can be used through example applications. But I should admit though that this book does a good job of serving as a reference. I also bought ""VoiceXML: 10 Projects to Voice-Enable your system"" that helped me to come up to speed to do a VoiceXML project."
1,Limited Flavor,Just tried this item and found it lacking in flavor and oil. The best flavor I have found is buying the sesame in the store as a 2-3 oz plastic package and toast them in my toaster oven.Sun Luck - Toasted Sesame Seeds 3.75 Oz.
2,Extremely wrong...,"The fifth book in the deathstalker series is very unpleasant end to a great series. For anyone thinking of reading this book, I would highly recommend stopping before the last 10-15 pages of the book. Believe me... you really don't want to know. These last pages are exactly what you don't want to be reading about the characters you have gone through 4 books with! A disgusting end to a wonderful series..."
1,Please save your money..,This series of books could do with a lot of editing.... (Some whole chapters seemed to be repeats from earlier books)the entire series should be parred down to one novel and then perhaps it would be a good read.
3,A Depressing Ending to a Great Series,"The Deathstalker series is absolutely wonderful. By the time you reach this book, you know the characters, you love the characters and you can't wait to see how it ends.Well it ends. It's like Simon got tired of writing or ran out of ideas and basically just cuts the cord.I was left disappointed and angry. Mind you, I loved the series... I just think he could've written a better ending.And is it really the end? Some things are left as if there is another series on the way... After all what about the mysterious aliens that are on their way to destroy life as we know it?"
2,I hated the story towards the end and the ending.,I hated the way the story ended it left me depressed and mad. it did not have to end the series like that how do we know whats to happen to hazel and with the terror and the hostilities with her alternate self's was he mad when he wrote this story that's the only explaination i could come up with i won't read anything else by him.
5,Absolutely the best yet!,"After finishing this book(I got it from an undisclosed source that will not be mentioned here), I was left in a state of catharsis. The author is an absolute genius to have everything connected the way it was! This book gives the answers to questions, brings the truth to light, and leaves you hoping for another one."
1,Reader Snored,"This was an enormously disappointing, jingoistic, mass market human interest biography from which I learned little about the Fed and monetary policy, but from which I learned a great deal about the author's commitment to pseudo-intellectual, hyper-libertarianism and what passes for serious literature in the U.S. mass market. Pass on this unless you want an invitation to worship at the grave of Ayn Rand. You could log into a right wing blog and get the same stuff for free."
2,This is a Schaum's?,"As a graduate student in physics, I have collected many Schuam's Outlines over the years and usually find them very helpful. This one was not up to par. The derivations and example problems were very wordy and skipped over half the mathematical details - one problem I did from the book required eleven steps when I was finished and the book showed three. Some chapters had only a few worked example problems and dozens that are given simply ""as an exercise to the reader."""
4,Good exercises.,"It is a complete book, it give a complete idea of the lagrangian dynamics. In my opinion there are books that give you a deep insight about concepts, but the exercises are fine and as introduction it is too."
3,It's ok,"Moderately helpful depending on what you're looking for. It was not very helpful for supplementing a graduate course in classical mechanics, but some of the problems were useful, though not most."
2,"I agree, this is NOT a Schaum's.","I have used Schaums outlines to help with several subjects in Engineering and Physics. This book was printed in 1967. Steps are missing for many of the examples, and answers are only included for the problems in Chapter 2."
1,Not easy.,"Claim to be easy, but still too 'physicist' point of view. Way too difficult to understand."
3,At least it's available,"If you just want to read the poems, this book will work. If you are looking for a nice book that you can enjoy holding or the feel of the pages you can savor as you read, skip it.The book is incredibly generic and poorly typeset, but available. You have to give it that."
1,Very poor quality,"The seller shipped this item quickly to me -- no problems there. My problem is with the quality of the candle. First off, even though it looks larger, the candle is incredibly small. Make note it is only 3 inches -- perfect for a cupcake topper, not a cake topper. Second, the quality is poor. The paint on the candle was scratched off in quite a few different areas. Third, the characters do not look identical to the trademark Sesame Street characters (more like a ""knock-off""). Yes, they do look like Sesame Street, but there are slight differences.Overall, I would not recommend this product. I will not be using it."
5,Emotional and scientific,"This is a beautiful marriage of the physicality of emotion and the psychological aspect. Greenfield explores theories of consciousness from a neurological background while also examining the subjective workings. Different perspectives are presented including depression, schizophrenia and drug use - the mind's workings in different states."
3,Pretty Good Story,"A good suspense book with a surprising end. The romance portion was on the weak side, but the mystery was good and the characters were well constructed. This is my 3rd Shayne romantic-suspense and I have found her to be an excellent writer thus far."
4,Very Good Book,The Gingerbread Man is the first book I have read by this author. I enjoyed the book very much. I plan to read other books by this author.
4,Great quick summer read,"I started enjoying Maggie Shayne when my sister-in-law gave me a trashy little book called ""Kick A$$"". Maggie Shayne had a story in there that I could not put down. Once I got over my embarrassment about reading something so utterly decadent, I went onto Amazon and searched out additional books by the same author. I have not been sorry. Maggie Shayne's books take me about 2-3 days to devour and they are perfect to be entertained and get lost in."
5,Amazing product,I recieved the item ahead of time and product was as described. I am very pleased with the product. Thank you
4,Whalesong,I thought Whalesong was a realy great book . Every time I stoppedI wanted to keep on reading. Now that is my favorite book.
4,Whale Song,"This book would be great for whale or animal lovers. You and Hruna explore the ocean blue. You bump into disasters and magical moments. Besides meeting whales you meet birds, dolphins, seals and more! This enchanted story touches your heart . This book makes you feel like you were really in the ocean blue.My sixth grade class and I read this book. Our Language Arts teacher let us talk about the book and for every chapter we had a lot to says. If we had a great experience, you will too! Read Whale Song and capture the experience."
2,Whalesong,This is an ok book. It is about a whale named Hruna. He meets friends while he's taking the lonely cruise. He also gets into danger. If you like whales then this is the book for you.
1,Whalesong,Whalesong is a book about a whale named Hruna. It tells about this adventures and the dangers of the ocean. I didn't like his book becuase I didn't think that there was anything fun about being a whale. Also I didn't like it because the author explained too much.
3,Whalesong,This book was very descriptive. Every sentence Robert Siegel wrote makes your mind boggle. I didn't like this book a lot because it was hard to understand. The end of the book was probably the best part because there was lots of action.
2,Whalesong,This book was boring. Most of the parts were dull but some were exciting. This book was also very short. I would not recommend this book to older readers.
3,Whalesong,I think this book was alright. it wasn't the best book that i have ever read. it was only good when somebody died. i wanted Hruna to die just to get some ction in the story. i would recommend this book only to people that like emotional stories because a loit of people would cry but i didn't.
2,Whalesong,"A very unsuspensful book. I didn't like how the whales knew so much and at the same time didn't ex: they knew what ice was and didn't know what a boat was. I also didn't like how the author made imagery and you didn't know what the object was that he was talking about. I also didn't like the story and the plot. You could also tell what was going to happen next. The book was about a calf who has many adventures, then he gets older and leads the pod."
4,Whalesong,"I thought this book was pretty good. The book was really descriptive, I could practically see the pictures in my head. Whalesong comes from the point of view of the whale. I enjoyed the book but I think it should have more action. They say that they need to watch out for Orcas and there are none. But otherwise it was a wonderful book."
4,a great book,"I'm in sixth grade my teacher read this book Whalesong for a read aloud book. This book was great ! There was a lot of good details, and this book is very touching. Right when you read the first sentence of this book, you will be a humpback whale called Hruna. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
4,Whalesong,"I think that the book Whalesong was a pretty good book. The only bad thing about it is that it was sometimes predictable and it was also sometimes hard to figure out what certain objects were because of the way that the author described it. But generally, the book was very good and enjoyable to read. It was basically about this whale, Hruna, telling about his his life story and all his adventures he had. The way Robert Siegel writes is like magic; each chapter a new adventure, taking you away."
3,Whalesong,"I thought this book was pretty good. I liked it because it had some action and some exciting parts, but not too much. The beginning didn't grab my attention but the end was very exciting. I would recommend this book for people who like animals."
3,Whalesong,The book Whalesong was great. It was about when Hruna goes on an adventure. He meets new friends and gets married to his best friend Lewte. Hruna and Lewte also have a baby named Hralekana. I would recommend this book to anyone. Robert Siegel is very creative. He uses imagery and many details. Some parts are sad and the others are really exciting.
3,Inside the Mind of a Humpback,"Whalesong is a book that discovers the mind of a whale. It gives the reader an opportunity to experience what it is like to be a whale, a male humpback. Hruna starts story from the first thing he remembers when he is born. He meets many friends, as well as enemies, and has several perilous adventures. Hruna closes his story with the description of his wife, Lewte, giving birth to his calf who they decide to name after a bold whale that joined the Ocean of Light which Hruna will never forget; Hralekana."
3,Whalsong,I liked the book Whalesong since the book took me into a whale's point of view on life. My favorite part of Whalsong is when the main character Hruna helps a fin whale named Finuwe rescue all the aquatic animals escape from captivity. Robert Siegel also described certain things that whales would not know what they where called. I strongly recommend reading this book since people of all ages would enjoy it.
2,Whalesong,I read Whalesong. I really didnt like it. It was boring me. The only parts I liked were the dangerous ones. It was not really an action book though. Robert Siegel is good with imagery but not with his writing skills. I wouldn't recomend this book to people because I think Robert Siegal went a little to far with the whalers.
2,The WhaleSong Book,"I didn't think the book Whalesong was good. I would of thought that there would be more action in a whale's life, more encounters with sharks, or maybe one of his dolphin friends fight a shark. I think Hruna should have met a human and become friends with him. The only exciting part was when Hruna saved everyone from the lagoon and when they escaped."
4,From the Viewpoint of a Humpback Whale,"I enjoyed this book because it took you on a journey as a whale. You experienced everything as Hruna from a calf to a leader of the pod. He went on adventures, wandered the oceans, made friends, added to his unique song, and escaped from the whale's enemy- man. It also explored into how humans are damaging the oceans and killing off whales. This insightful book left me with something to think about."
5,"A magical, beautifully written story","It is rare that an author writes a book from the perspective of a non-human animal that actually makes you feel as if THIS IS THE ANIMAL TALKING. The world of the whales is spun around us, in a magical, unforgettable tale. I felt as though I was really there, swimming with the whales. More non-human animals need their experiences expressed- and literature may be the best way. YOU- YES, YOU- MUST READ THIS BOOK. Even for those who simply wish to enjoy faultless literature, this book is a must-read."
5,An Awsome Book for readers of all ages to enjoy,"Whalesong by Robert Siegel is a great book to read, not only for children, but for adults as well. The story is about the life of a humpback whale starting from when he is a calf and shows him growing to be a full and very large humpback whale as an adult. We read his life story and the adventures that he goes on as he is growing up and introduces us to all sorts of marine life that he meets along his adventures. All in all this book is about eleven chapters long, all the chapters are great to read and get you to wonder what happens in the next chapter. I highley recommend this book for all readers of all ages."
4,GREAT,WHALESONG IS A GREAT BOOK.THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN BY ROBERT SIEGEL. HE WRITES THIS IN THE WHALES POINT OF VIEW.THIS BOOK IS ABOUT WHALES.THE BOOK IS TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS WHALE NAMED HRUNA. THE BOOK TELLS ABOUT THE WHOLE LIFE OF HRUNA.ROBERT SIEGEL SHOWS YOU WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A WHALE AND ALL THE TROUBLES A WHALE CAN RUN INTO. THIS BOOK HAS ALOT OF DETAILS.
3,Whalesong,I am having a very hard time getting into the book. I have read about a third of it. My imagination can not go that far out there.
4,Whalesong,I thought that this book was a good tale about a humback whale who went on an adventure and met different friends from the sea. I would recommend this book to any readers who are up to a good adventure book. I thought this book was good because it had action and adevnture.
3,Whalesong,"I thought the book Whalesong was an okay book, because at the end it was kind of weird. But in a way I thought it was good book, when it explained the death. They should have made a movie out of this story, because it was an exciting book."
1,Very Dissatisfied,"My item was not what was expected. It said the item was in acceptable condition yet it was a complete waste. The DS had tons of scratches, the hindge when you open the screen is half broken, it had no stylus, no charger and no mario kart game. Instead I got two gameboy games and a barn yard DS game"
4,"Colour is freaky, but Mario Kart is Fun!","I received the Mario Kart bundle for Christmas. The unit is the same as all the others...not much to say there. The shockingly bright red colour is weird (matte finish). Mario Kart is fun, but doesn't allow you do much in downloadable DS to DS mode. The person who downloads the game has to be the little skull guy, who isn't very cute or fun. I find that playing with other players via Wifi is much more fun! The racetracks are varied and pleasant to look at. Many of the challengers via Wifi are skilled and that keeps the game interesting."
4,good oil but expensive,"Not so sure it is worth paying for the unique flow characteristics, but if you want to avoid drainage during storage it is one answer."
1,NEED'S Photo!,I would like to buy a Silver Brush/Comb set for my daughter but not sight unseen! It's hard enough to tell the quilty with just a photo and without one...No Way!
5,Jive Bunny,Product arrived in excellent condition and has no problems. I am very happy with Amazon and will purchase from them again.
1,Not worth buying at any price,"I suppose you have to be disappointed sometimes. Of the many products I have purchased from Amazon, this is one that disappoints. The recording volume is very low and therefore, even through my 2.1 desktop system, the output is limited. Rather than return the item, I gave it to a friend (who hopefully is now not my enemy)."
5,Jive Bunny,This is a fun musical cd. Use it for listening or exercising. It will keep you jumping for more. Enjoy
5,Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers,I had this CD as a child and between moving rooms in my house and moving away to college I lost it. I searched for months to find a new one and finally found it on Amazon. It was in brand new condition and was just as good as I remembered it.
5,Jive Bunny is a great energizer!,This is the third copy of Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers I have purchased. I teach seventh grade as well as graduate education courses and the first three bands are especially good for getting a group up and moving. I use it to make Bodily-Kinesthetic activities more fun. Great music (everyone knows most of the tunes) and just plain fun. Jive Bunny puts a smile on your face.
5,"Great, very nostalgic.",This an excellent combination of upbeat music from the 40's through the 60's. It is very well done and makes my aerobics class easier to get through.
4,Best of the alternatives here,"Good but not perfect. I have an old workmate, this is almost as good. I have seen all the others listed here in stores here and there. This one seems to me to be the best of the lot. The steel parts are all well made and sturdy. The wheels work ok. My old Workmate didn't have wheels and I could see leaving them off, but they are not in the way. This a simple tool pretty well made.If they made the top out of Ipe and put a v-grove in the clamping edges and made the cranks and dogs out of sturdier plastic or better out of brass, this would probably be perfect and last forever."
4,portability?,Easy to assemble and sturdy enough for the price. I was hoping for a stand which could be moved with the tool on it. The wheels are fine for moving the station alone but (being a petite woman) I think trying to tilt the station to the handle side to move it would be asking for a disaster with a heavy tool on board.
3,It does it's job,"I really like my little stand, it's was inexpensive and it works. I would say the major drawbacks, are that it is such a pain to put together. None of the pieces are together, and with the flimsy materials, it's hard to keep everything level and in line. Additionally, it is cheaply built. The top is made of plastic and particle board. I've had it for a year, and the edges have already chipped off. The metal on the underneath is flimsy, and I don't think it would hold anything very heavy. For me, it's a pain to fold up (but that may be because I am the one that put it together). All in all, I think this is an average product, so I am giving it an average review."
4,Great light weight table,I had a B&D 400 series many years ago (many years ago...)and the quality and construction were considerably better but man was it heavy. This is functionally sound but a little light weight. Not flimsey but it does not hold it's ground when you are working on it. Needs to be braced against a wall to keep it from wandering. Otherwise good product.
2,Posable Pony,"The pony was cute and soft as promised, but wasn't as big as expected and it's eyes were a little lopsided."
1,Stopped Spraying Solution!,I purchased this piece of junk for a friend so she could clean her carpets. After using it a few times it decided to stop spraying. Now all it can do is vacuum the floor and it is not very good at that either. My Hoover carpet cleaner does a mediocre job but at least it continues to work after 8 years!
1,Money wasted,"I purchased this machine a year ago and after two uses it was in to be repaired. The pump that makes the solution spray from the tool handle and the machine stopped working and had to be repalced. I had it back from the repair person and used it once. Low and behold I went to use it this evening and the pump is out again. Do not waste your money on this product!!! Very upsetting to spend almost $200 on an item I was only able to use 4 times. That stinks, Bissell should be ashamed what a rip off!"
1,Not Long Term Reliable,"After about a year, it wouldn't dispense solution but was out of warranty. Got it repaired. About another year later, we have the same problem. I'm not repairing it yearly.When it works it's great. The problem is reliability."
3,A SHIPPING DISTASTER,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM, WHICH WAS DELIVERED VIA FED-EX! WHAT A NIGHTMARE. THE SHAMPOOER WAS DELIVERED TO THE WRONG APARTMENT. THE BOX WAS A HOT MESS... CRUSHED AND DAMAGED. THE RESULT: A DAMAGED SHAMPOOER. IT THEN BECAME MY RESPONSIBILITY TO USE MY FUNDS TO PURCHASE TAPE TO REPACKAGE THE BOX FOR RETURN...THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES. THREE ATTEMPTS TO PICK UP NEVER HAPPENED BECAUSE THE PERSON WOULD NOT TAKE THE ELEVATOR TO THE SECOND AND COME TO MY DOOR IT GET IT, THEY CHOOSE TO LEAVE A PICK UP TAG ATTACHED TO THE MAILBOX..EVEN AFTER THEY GAINED ACCESS THROUGH THE SECURITY DOOR...NO PICK UP. AS A CUSTOMER, I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO REPACKAGE THE COURIERS ERROR. WALK THE SHAMPOOER DOWNSTAIRS TO THE LOBBY...TO BE PICKED UP. THIS WAS A TOTAL MESS AND FEDERAL EXPRESS CONTRACTS OUT AND DUE TO THEIR OUTSOURCING...SOME PEOPLE CAN'T DO THE JOB APPARENTLY."
1,Warning: Bad for the ecology!,"Used this cleaner 4 times since owning it, and always had a problem getting it to work right.Today was the final straw! The cleaner spray DID NOT WORK, and got up a very nice sweat pushing a heavy, useless carpet cleaner around with water spills all over the floor. I went to look at the user manual, and to my shock, Bissell sent an owners manual for an upright vacuum cleaner! Went to the web, took apart the key areas, looked at trouble shooting section and there was no way the spryer is going to work! So.... it now lies waiting for the garbage pick up eventually on its way to a LANDFILL. This company makes an inferior product and with all the bad machines contributes to landfill pollution which is bad for our ecology!! The lost $230 is also bad for my personal economyThanks Bissell!!!!!!!!!. Will never buy another product made by you.Now I need to look up carpet cleaner rentals :-("
2,Worked very well until it no longer worked.,I have 5 rooms of carpet.. This machine did a remarkable job of cleaning all my carpeted rooms and carpeted stairs. I was so proud of the Bissell Proheat 2X. Everthing was throughly cleaned. Unfortunately the machine stoped sucking the water up after the third use. There is strong suction but it will not pick up water. The last time I had my carpets professionally cleaned by Stanley Steamer the cost was almost equivalent to the cost of this machine. The difference is that Stanley Steamer did the work and not me. I gave this a 2 star because when it worked it worked very well otherwise I would have given it a one star for lack of durability. I am going to go to Consumers Report now before I buy another carpet cleaner.
1,Bissell Bummer,"This carpet cleaner went bad not two weeks after I purchasedit. It quit dispensing solution and quit picking it up.I went through the on-line trouble shooting manual,andtried everything, but it still would not work.This was an expensive lemon."
4,GREAT!!!!!!!,"I was a bit apprehensive after reading the negative reviews, however the positiveoutweighed them and I decided to chance it. I am thrilled with this machine. It does what is advertised to do andhas already paid for itself! I hate to admit how long it had been since the rugs hadbeen cleaned, but this cleaner did an outstanding job the first try. I highly recommend it."
4,Bissell carpet shampoo machine,Love the machine.... does an excellent job of cleaning. I would like to see a few changes:1. Make it easier to clean the brushes. Have to remove 4 screws to access the brushes and I foresee in the future the phillips screw becoming worn out.2. Leaving extra cleaning fluid in the machine until next use is not a good idea. There was some minimal leaking.3. Accessary hose was easily dislodged from its on-machine hose holder.4. Price of more cleaning agent is pretty spendy.... $12 - $18 depending upon size of container. I have been using Simple Green for carpets with good success.
1,Bissell blues...,"This machine sucks...rather, it doesn't suck. It puts the washing liquid out on the carpet, but doesn't suck it back up! We bought it through Sears, and they would not take it back for refund or trade. Bissell would not fix or refund or send a new one. Instead, they had us take the blasted machine to local fix-it guy, who took MONTHS to ""fix"" it. We took it home to find out that it still didn't work! So we are trying to increase the suction power via bungee cord. If this doesn't work, I'm going back to good ol' Hoover. (If Hoover was good enough for Grandma, it's good enough for me.)"
1,NO LONGER BISSELL'S GUINA PIG,"These bissill units break without fail. I have owned three in three years, and each and everyone is broken. Every year they have a new model and now I know why, we are the Guina pigs for bissell. It will work fairly well at first, then it will be unrepairable. Thier pro heat is a joke, your tap water gets hotter. I have four dogs- I bought a hoover steam vac 1 month ago, you would not believe the dirt and grime that is coming up after three years of these horrible bissell units. Just spot cleaning and one unit lasted long enough to clean my entire carpet, ha but I just did the carpet with a HOOVER and it is unbelievable. Do yourself a favor if you are serious and need a unit to last, DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,Not worth the $$,"I have owned the Bissel ProHeat 2X for about 4 months and I am not happy with it. First it is really really heavy to move around. So heavy that by the time I am done using it I have blisters on my hands. Second, the tools leak the cleaning solution all down the hose and then makes everything very sticky, third it does not hold much clean water, fouth after only 4 months mine stopped working. First the brushes would no spin, so i figured out that the bands had popped off..fix that. Then It would not spit out the water and cleaning solution. Called Bissel and they walked me thru some stuff to try and finally they said they dont know whats wrong and I would have to send it to be fixed. So I tried some stuff on my own and fixed it for about 10 minutes. Then it wouldnt suck up the water. Finally after about and 2 hours I gave up."
1,Do Not Buy This,"Worked great the first time, just like the ones I had rented previously for 1/10th the cost of buying. However the problems started on the second use. The water stopped coming out and I had to take it in to get it fixed, of course that was not covered under any warranty. This was after hours of frustration trying to clean it, take it apart, etc. Trying to use it for third time today, again no water. Throwing it in the trash and going back to renting."
1,Not recommended,"This unit worked reasonably well when I first bought it and we used it approximately 20 times to remove small carpet stains, but a few weeks past the manufacturers warranty period it stopped working, and we took it to an approved service center for repair. The unit was found to have a faulty water pump which was replaced, costing me about $120 in parts and labor and it worked fine. A year later after approximately 10 more uses and it's stopped working again, there is no water coming out which happened before. It's just not worth having it fixed this time when it will likely happen again soon, when I can use the money to buy a better and more reliable carpet cleaner. It's a shame Bissell used to known for quality products, but I will be buying a new unit from a different manufacturer."
2,great until you store it,"It cleaned well but after it is stored it won't work. it seems everyone has a problem with it (check the internet) after it sits for a while- heater clogs, tubes clog. I have spent hours looking into those problems just to come to the conclusion that it may be the pump that went out. I would not buy this product again. The whole point in buying one is to have it there when you need it and not to have to rent. However, most people spend so much time unclogging or preventing clogs that it is not worth your time. You will either spend your time going to the store to rent a machine or spend your time disassembling your machine while you hope you can fix it."
2,Leaves water behind,"The 9200 cleans well enough, but if you have dogs then be prepared for the brushes and the intake area to be caked with dog hair. The bottom of the machine also gets wet dog hair all over it which then holds water and drips it all over the carpet once you turn the machine off. After every use there are drops of water left behind on the carpet from the wet dog hair and you have to turn the machine over and pull all that wet dog hair off the bottom and off the rollers. Not a pleasent job."
5,"Works well, exceeds expectation","This machine gives a really good result as the suction and hot water do a great job.. and the brushes scrub nicely and leave the carpet looking groomed.. really. Only comment is regarding changing the water often. Oh yeah, the stair attachment cleans clean and fast with nice hot water."
2,I'm taking it back,"Five years ago, we bought a Bissell ProHeat carpet cleaner, and we used the heck out of it. Over the years, I broke off parts, patched it back up, and it kept working. Finally, it bit the dust this fall I went out and bought the Model 9200 ProHeat 2x as a replacement. Let's just say this year's crop wasn't as good as the crop in 2003.It still cleans the carpet, but there are two crucial areas where this model falls short. First, there is no visual indicator to let you know it is still feeding water and/or solution. The old model also had a light to show you if you were pulling too fast or too slow.The new model doesn't seem to dry the carpet as well, and it seems like the water and solution run out faster than the old model.Looking over the market, it doesn't seem like there are as many models to choose from as there were five years ago. Progress?"
1,Horribly dissatisfied!,As a pet owner I shampoo my carpets often. This machine is a joke when it comes to cleaning my carpets. Even after vacuuming everyday and before shampooing I get large clumps of hair left behind on the carpet. The suction is terrible with this machine. Also the bladder with the clean water is a terrible idea. If you are like me and always read reviews before I buy I hope this helps at all. It had many wonderful reviews but if you own more than one dog do not buy this machine.I always buy bissell but I wish I would have waited for the lift-off to come out.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I made the mistake of purchasing this machine as i thought it would be a huge conveniece for cleaning my carpets. I purchaed it 2 years ago and since then I have only been able to use it a total of 6 times! The fist time I used it, it worked great, however after that the cleaning was shoddy and machine clogged in several places to the point where it would not wet the carpet or suction the water up. I have had to put it in the shop several times and each time the repair person has said that all the cleaning solution crystalized and clogge the tubes. I am using the bissel carpet cleaner and dont understand how this can continue to happen. I just got it out of the shop again on 16 August 2011 and today, 27 August 2011 is my first time attempting to use it....expectedly IT DOES NOT WORK! At this point I am completely done with the Bissel ProHeat 2X and suggest you do not waste your time or money on this product!"
1,Stopped working after only a few uses,"Exact same problem as everyone else - after a short time, the water stops spraying.Bought this from a local retailer about a year ago, now after only a few uses (how often do you use a steam-cleaner?), the water doesn't spray out. Without the water, this is just an overpriced vacuum, right?This Bissell is a piece of crapola that will break after only a few uses."
3,Make sure the container is secure!,"One person said the cleaner did not pick up the water. You have to make sure the water container is pushed in really good & has a good seal. The first time I used it, it didn't pick up the water; after reading the manual, I tried again & pushed down on the container while steamer was on. Could really 'hear' the difference when pushed down with a good seal.I prefer the Hoover which has separate clean & dirty water containers & for ease of use!"
5,Bissell 2X rocks!!,"I bought this product because my old Bissell carpet cleaner lasted 7 years. I figured with the Bissell name, I would probably be satsified with it. WOW!! I am blown away by the machine and it's results.Pros: Two brushes are definintely better than one. It puffed up my old carpet. It has simple design and is very easy to clean compared to the older models. It was a snap to assemble and fill with solution/water.Cons: It is hard to tell when the clean water bladder is full since all the dirty water surrounds the bladder when in use. If you bump the vacuum against a wall it does loose suction.Overall, this was a bargain. I am seeing results that I can only get when I have the professionals come out and clean.I thought that my old vacuum was really picking up the cat hair until I used this machine. It will ball up the hair that wasn't vacuumed up."
1,Bissell 9200 ProHeat a deep disappointment,"I bought this machine about a year ago. Right out of the box it was trouble. The soap dispenser didn't empty any soap one time....the next time it was empty way before the water ran out. Then the water quit coming out. Now I ask you....how hard is it to get water to run down hill? Anyway, with much difficulty I did manage to get our screened in porch outdoor carpet reasonably clean.Today it was time to do it again. Well, this time all of the problems mentioned in other reviews happened to me too....clumps of fuzz and dirt all over the carpet......suction clogged, water wouldn't come out....In short this machine is going to the dump....One big waste of money. Amazon needs to put the negative reviews at the top. I looked before I bought....just not close enough. What I saw was the good review."
1,Frustrating Waste of Time & $$$,"I have owned this unit for 18 months and have not completely cleaned my house yet. Everytime I drag it out, I get a room or hall clean, then SOMETHING has to be dealt with.I have replaced the pump that makes water spray once ($30.) now it's quit again. The autorized repair guy says he is always working on this model.It's hard to tell how much water you are sucking up, it's impossible to clean the ""business"" end. If you have animals, hair clots are an ongoing nightmare even after a thorough vacuuming.I'll never purchase a Bissell product again."
5,Step-by-step drawings instruct on bowie knife engagements,"Dwight C. McLemore's ADVANCED BOWIE TECHNIQUES: THE FINER POINTS OF FIGHTING WITH A LARGE KNIFE provides high-quality and large-size step-by-step line drawings to accompany specific insights on bowie knife engagements. From an introductory history of James Bowie and his special knife to a basic fighting system which builds upon foundation skills and teaches more complex fighting techniques with the knife, ADVANCED BOWIE TECHNIQUES is for any who already has some familiarity with the big blade and seeks skills improvement."
5,Perfect for toys too...,"Very sturdy and well made. Fits perfectly over the rods in my closet.I have several of these, I'm using some for shoes and using two for my sons' toys. They're perfect for their stuffed animals, bath toys, and even their receiving blankets.Awesome product."
2,Mine was defective,"I give it 2 stars because it is a very functional product, but my item was defective, and I had to ship it back. The material on one side was uneven, resulting in the bag hanging unevenly and one side being shorter than the other. Not only didn't it look good, but it also was more difficult to use. That said, maybe it was just my bad luck with this product."
5,Shoe storage for closet,I really like the double wide concept. It doesn't hang down too far in the closet but holds just as many shoes.
1,Buyer Beware!,"Everything possible was wrong with this shoe bag! The ""canvas"" fabric was so thin and light-weight that it could pass for muslin. As a result, the appearance was flimsy and very wrinkled. The sewing was sloppy, with loose threads, uneven seams, fraying edges, and no consistency in pocket size. Most of the pockets were noticeably askew, i.e. not level. And the two bags we purchased were over 2"" different in length. This is definitely not a quality product, nor could it possibly stand up under daily use. We returned them immediately."
1,Merkury Innovations Woes,"I wouldn't know about the product, because mine never worked right. From the getgo, it only worked if BOTH batteries were fully charged. As soon as one became depleted, the grip would not switch to the other. Nor would it work with just one battery in it. Which, of course, completely defeats the purpose. After talking to the manufacturer (Merkury Innovations), it was determined that mine was defective and ought to be returned for exchange, and that was when insult was added to injury: this company has the poorest customer service skills I've ever witnessed anywhere, matched only by their lack of internal communication. First, they denied having received the return for days, while I had a P.O.D, only to realize that it was on the desk of someone who had quit. Now, I have to wait until they order the replacement from the factory. In all, I've been waiting almost two weeks now for resolution, which I find unacceptable. Call me picky if you wish..."
4,For the price it is worth it,"This grip is decently well made- the plastic is not quite as good as the case of my Nikon D50, but it defintely helps the battery life (with two batteries) and makes the camera much more comfortable for my larger hands."
1,D50s????,Anytime the manufacturer describes a product that doesn't exist....STAY AWAY! If the reviews don't speak for themselves. I have never heard of the D50S is it related to the D70S?
3,"Review for ""Music is the Master Key""","I found the content very interesting -- the response of forensic psychiatric patients to music while responding very poorly, or not at all to other therapies.What, to me, needs much improvement, is the grammar/syntax in the writing of this book. Corrections to the many printing errors are also needed.Rated: two and a half to three out of five points."
5,A Great candle and a Great Parfum as well,We love the scent of Fresh Candle Cannabis and we both fight over the bottle of the parfum. This is a scent BOTH men and women adore and that is not an easy thing to find!
4,Good Product,"It was easy to attach, and certainly seems to provide protection for the screen. I bought this product to take preventative measures after reading the reviews about the fragile LCD screen on the Cannon 400 Sureshot Elf."
4,"Great idea, but limited due to Canon","I bought this for my Sd400. It does a great job of protecting the LCD screen from sctatches and cracks, but lint will still find its way in. It's easy to put on, contrary to the previous reviewer's statements. But you do want a sharp instrument to cut the adhesive.Also, my SD400 Lcd broke anyway - screen went white. Though this was no fault of the protector!My only complaint about it is that it would be nice if both sides were scratch resistant. Due to the lint problem, I'll have to remove the protector maybe two or three times per year to clean off the screen, and every time I put it down (even on a soft surface) a new scratch shows on it. Plus, the adhesive is a little too good. If you have to remove the screen protector, be very careful. I used a knife and it came off alright, but I was very nervous!I'd recommend it for all Canon LCDs 2 inches or larger (god forbid) since Canon engineers are too stupid to make the screen durable."
1,cannot rated due to installation difficulty,"I bought due to the reviews, but once I opened the package, I have no idea which side is the camera side and which is the scratch resistant. The product may be great, but the package is poorly designed. There is no label on the LCD protector which it should. Cannot install and cannot use the product. Wrote email to the company, no answer. Look at the company's web, no instruction to identify the side of the protector."
1,Be very careful-may be poor quality,"I purchased this set when it was at a discount of around 40%. The china I received was of very poor quality, the porcelain was bulky, and the painting uneven and heavy-looking. It was of course made in Thailand, not England. It could not be used alongside my current settings so I returned it. I would not purchase here again, as one cannot be certain where the china was manufactured, although the lower the price perhaps the lower the quality."
1,It moves around!,"I had one of these for a while... but it was pointless - it moved around and would not stay still. I found one online that has a built in adhesive strip on the bottom - it works much better. You can find out more about it at ParkingTarget.com or just search for it, I think Amazon sells it. It is called a ParkingTarget."
4,Works very well,"I have 2 of these and they do a nice job staying put, which keeps us parking in the same spot. Just far enough so the door does not hit the bumper on it's way down. Has a smaller hump to go over the first time to let you know you are on track. The second larger bump, keeps you in the right spot. Really like them. Thinking about getting another one for our 3rd car."
3,Nice but not what I expect,"Very simple and clear intro into the new Microsoft technologies as WCF and WPF but the book lacks deeper description of internal mechanisms on which those technologies are built. I'd rather call this book not ""professional winfx"" but rather ""introduction to winfx"" of ""beginning winfx""."
3,Not one of his best...,"I don't think this man ever put in a bad vocal performance in his entire life, and that goes for this CD also. But there are some weak songs in this collection. ""El Rey"" is in a class of his own and he has well over five dozen outstanding CD's available. So when ranking them I compare his works against eachother, and that sets the highest of standards.This collection falls short only because many of these songs frankly are just not that interesting. There are some really strong tunes such as ""Guadalahara"" and ""Como Mexico No Hay Dos"". However, there are some somber and dull clunkers too. I personally could not wait for the plodding ""Arbolitos"" to end.With so many awesome CD's to choose from, Chente fans are a very fortunate bunch. Unless you just want 'em all though, I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,Noisiest Shoes I've Ever Worn,All I hear is *squish squish squish* as I walk in these shoes. Wish I'd spent a bit more for something nicer.
3,Nice reproduction but error in book tilte,"I was thrilled to receive a reproduced copy of this historic book. Contents all good as far as I know. Well bound, text ultra-clear. However, I was really disappointed when I realised the title was slightly in error, so that was a bit of a downer. I am stunned that such a nice reproduction should have an error in the title. It should be ""A successful expedition through the interior of Australia"" not simply ""Successful expedition through the interior of Australia"" as printed on the title page. How could the editor get is so wrong. True, it is only a minor error, but so glaringly obvious. It might cause a bit of a dilemma when including it in a bibliography or list of references. Disappointing."
1,No stick,"I can't imagine what one would use this for, as the magnetic strength is virtually nonexistent. I suppose one could stick strips on both the item and the receiver and hope they will stick when the strips align."
4,Future Retro,"Fantastic, simply the best Retro 80's CD I own. Would be 5 star rating only a little dissapointed with ""White Lines"" cover. Apart from this the CD lives in my car and is played always."
4,A refreshing change of pace,"Okay, dance remix albums are typically not my thing. However, Future Retro knows exactly how to tap into an audience my age. The concept of this collection is to take new wave and pop-rock songs of the eighties and have them remixed by some of today's hottest DJ's. As is the case with most remixes, most of the songs are cut down to a few lines, but the final product still struck a chord with me.What child of the eighties didn't grow up listening to INXS, The Cure, Howard Jones, New Order, and Devo? It's this kind of familiarity that will draw you into Future Retro. These remixes could never replace the originals, but they're a refreshing change of pace. Might I add, The Cure never sounded so happy."
5,fresh new spins on some of the best the 80s had to offer!,"This CD is amazing! Some of the remixes are even BETTER than their 80s counterparts, if you can believe that. Yaz's ""Situation,"" Depeche Mode's ""Shake the Disease,"" and Erasure's ""Respect"" are examples of this, in my opinion. Honorable mention goes to ""Need You Tonight"" and ""Sugar Kisses,"" in which it can be said that both remixes seem to add a fresh new spins to the originals. However, the updated ""Bizarre Love Triangle,"" while still in keeping with the spirit of the original song, also loses that ""oomph"" in the process. And the Morrissey remix is just plain ghastly. With the exception of the blended ""Morrissey over Morrissey"" Christmas caroler effect at the end of the song, it is all over the place in terms of direction. But overall, the CD is a great buy and a must-have for any 80s obsessed music fan. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Could have been so much better!!,Since 2005 I have been waiting patiently for this release.I have to say that the selection of artists remixed is disappointing. The Cure remix is the first track & the highlight for me. It is a heavier remix than the one on the mixed up album. I also enjoyed the INXS remix. New Order's remix was ok but didn't really work I feel. Echo was ok but the Morrissey remix closing the cd is an embarrassment. Overall some good remixes but not enough great ones to warrant purchase. I loved the 80's & most of the artists featured but feel only 1 or 2 tracks do any justice to the originals.
2,80's remixed versions,"Sometimes Adding techno beats or bass on a retro song kill the feeling of the originality of the hit. a CD with 14 songs and only 2 or 3 from TOP 10 weekly hits from 80's is not fare- that's why people doesn't buy cd's.I'am 80's fan and Dj collector, I did enjoy every single hit from that dacade in this CD the only songs to be rescueBizarre Love Triangle , Need You Tonight, SituationThey kill Little Respect in that remix.If you love 80's hits buy it Used price recomended"
3,rejects,"I have the 'real' remixes of most, if not all, of these songs; CD singles, etc. and this appears to be a compilation of mixes that each of these artists rejected from adding to the myriad list of 'dance versions' of their songs. Another reviewer said it well... sometimes the 160bpm and techno track added to these just ruins the song; a remix is supposed to enhance the original."
2,her voice gets higher and higher,her voice gets higher and higher in this one.i had to turn it off. i felt her anxiety coming through the speakers
1,TMI completely unnecessary,"In the introduction is a vivid description of a baby urinating upon its father. NOT what I would want to see in a book about food. Absolutely revolting! That, coupled with the fact that the author couldn't be bothered to back up his often-incorrect information (to such an extreme degree that this book should be classified as fiction) makes this one worth skipping.If you do read this book, you may want to check the ""facts"" against other sources before relating any stories to other people, lest they make you look like a fool when you're proven wrong. I don't believe that this book will truly enrich someone's knowledge of food."
2,Yuck!,I'll read almost anything and I love food and history so I thought this would be a perfect fit. Mostly I was just disgusted. I felt like the author was purposely trying to be as gross as possible. He also had all these random facts or stories spread throughout that didn't seem to go with anything. This is the very first time that I have been unable to finish a book.
3,Hmm not sure...,This product i purchased almost seems like its used...the box it came in was taped as if it was opened before...the listing said new product but i am almost positive it is a returned item....
3,Average Moisturizing Cream - Not For The Sensitive,"I ordered this for a massage CEU class, which required Shea Butter for a portion of the class. This is *not* straight Shea and if you need pure Shea, this will not do you a lick of good.So, I decided to try it as a cream for my arms, just to test it out. The Palmer's formulation actually felt like it burned my skin, which can happen when you are too sensitive. And, I really don't like the smell.After years of testing different brands, I still think that the best sensitive skin lotion I have found is the Curel Ultra Healing Lotion (red banner on front)Curel Ultra Healing Lotion, 20 Ounce. Just note that it is not a Shea product.If you need to purchase a straight Shea Butter, I can suggest the ""NOW"" brandNOW Foods Shea Butter, 7-Ounceor something which is pure. I ended up picking up the NOW brand at my local Whole Foods. It comes in a small open mouth tub and worked wonderfully."
3,A great start to the subject,"Jim McCallen's book was once the only one available to the modern reader on this topic. It has since been eclipsed by Stephen Duford's ""The Irish Highwaymen"", but McCallen's book has a uniqueness and charm of its own, and is still worth getting. The author relates the lore on various Irish Highwaymen to the reader as though he were a Seanachie and as you read his book you get the feeling that you are the latest in a long line of people who have had these stories about Irish fighting men told to them. Although many Irish Highwaymen were not ""heroic"", many in their own way - as guerrilla fighters harrassing their enemies - were indeed so, and McCallen's book offers you the chance to experience these great tales in the nearest thing to a traditional Irish storytelling format that modern readers of books can get."
5,Business Writing and Communication Reference,This book covers many aspects of business writing. I use it regularly. The clean design and spiral binding make it very easy to use as a reference tool. I highly recommend this book to any company that has employees who need to sharpen their writing skills.
2,Not so hot,"From the advertizing blurb, I had expected far more views from the inside of the plane looking out, i.e., more of a sense of what is was like to fly IN a spitfire. There were a few of these, but mostly it was info about the spitfire's history and development, etc., which was interesting but not why I bought this DVD (I have that in books elsewhere)."
3,The heart of meditation:pathways to a deeper experience,"A good book by an ex Siddha Yoga Swami, suggest you read some of Swami Muktananda's books, for what I would consider a greater experience."
5,My favorite book on meditation,"Sally Kempton's book ""The Heart of Meditation"" is reviving my daily meditation practice. Since I've purchased this book, I have been reading small excerpts in the morning before my meditation and using one of her methods to access the deeper realms of meditation. Instead of the ""half asleep reverie"" that I was usually experiencing in my meditations, I have been havingwonderful meditations; deep, focused and heart-connected. If you love to meditate, or if you would like to learn how to love meditation, I recommend this book above all others."
2,Just Didn't Grab Me,"Sorry, but I feel the need to say this mass market paperback is, at best, so-so. Except for a few well known figures, it is mostly like reading a dictionary, or a who's-who about --- who cares? Maybe it's just me, but it just didn't grab me. Sorry."
2,".....,","OK as another of already many well known sources of well known information on well known Generals. How did it ever get published? So much for merit...Takes the exploits of U. S. Military Academy graduates and manages to make them boring. And, I was surprised at how poor, almost amateurish, the writing was.That said, everyone likes military warriors and heroes. It could rate another star or two if an editor or someone helped put the information on paper in a more interesting way."
2,"Caution! For West Point Graduates, Only.","If you're a graduate of West Point who likes to bask in the sun of all the self-congratulating books on the West Point Military Academy, no reason why you shouldn't read this one, also. As for me, a mere citizen (former enlisted) history buff, I found this little paperback uninteresting. What I thought might be interesting is old hat, and what isn't old hat is verrry boring and uninteresting. The price is [inexpensive], however (if you don't value your own time). Sorry."
4,The Georgia Studies Book: Our State and the Nation,If you want to learn about Georgia this is the book to read!
4,A Delightful Learning Tool,"The beauty of this book is twofold: it presents information in small chunks and includes lovely graphics. Some astrology books contain little imagery beyond illustrations of charts, houses and the like...and the text gets a bit dry. This book breathes life into a complex subject with lively text and vivid imagery. It's a great study aid, because the reader can focus on one topic (usually 2-3 pages) and let that sink in before moving on."
1,Technodrivel,Rarely if ever do I feel the need to put a book away before i even get through half of it. This was ridiculous
1,Absolute rubbish,"as someone interested in technology and the internet, I had had heard so much about Gibson I decided to give this book a go. Crass Unpolished American Rubbish."
4,"Hey, he INVENTED the Internet!","10 flashy stories here -- quick, action-packed, high-tech, impressive. Best R: ""Burning Chrome,"" ""The Winter Market,"" ""Hinterlands,"" & my favorite, ""The Gernsback Continuum,"" which shows Gibson has a sense of humor, 2 -- it's a look at the AMAZING projected science-fictional world of the 30s which comes back 2 get a blase photographer of the 80s -- with a vengeance. U'll laff.""Burning Chrome"" & ""The Winter Market"" have some great visionary sections -- U'll C these stories, not just read them. ""Winter Market"" would make a great music video....Gibson's novels R cool, 2: NEUROMANCER, COUNT ZERO, MONA LISA OVERDRIVE & VIRTUAL LIGHT R all worth Xploring...."
5,Cyberpunk must read,"If you like Cyberpunk, you'll have to read these short stories. Not only do they make Neuromancer a lot more comprehensible, but they are good short stories in their own right.From gritty noir type stories to the more happy, each explores a part of the human condition. Although some, like Chrome, hardly aspire to human condition.Why is it some people just fit in? You don't want to know what Gibson thinks.What happens to someone who is alive before the art they can create is creatable? Or - what would Picasso's home page look like, if you prefer to reverse the question.And if you take away someone's reason to live, can you take their place.Plus there is, as always, monoclonal antibodies, drugs, the hot research scientists who create them and the Edge. The people who live around the Edge.It's filled with delightful images: ""Teeth so straight they could be used as a credit reference.""It's little pieces of Gibson's world, put out like a jigsaw puzzle, that Neuromancer assembles."
2,Gib me a break.,"Too many reviews praising this collection of stories for the simple reason it's Gibson. Neuromancer was fantastic, but these short stories were so awful I couldn't even finish the collection!I'd have to say this is one for the ""I gotta read anything Gibson writes"" crowd. The rest of us could probably do without it."
4,This is a book which should be read by any Gibson fan.,"I wasn't expecting too much with this book. I really enjoyed ""The Difference Engine"" and found ""Neuromancer"" a bit cold, but interesting. However, the stories collected here show how Gibson's writing has evolved. I really couldn't find a weak story in this group. The standouts are ""New Rose Hotel"", ""Hinterlands"", ""Burning Chrome"", and ""Red Star, Winter Orbit"". This book has heightened my interest for more of Gibson's work - like ""Mona Lisa"" or ""Count Zero""."
1,I wish I could have seen the whole movie. The guy sold me a bad movie disc.,"Great plot. Too bad right in the middle of watching this great movie with Richard Gere and Denzel, the movie this person sold me started to do freezing. Wish I would have ordered a better copy."
3,Power,"This video is an excellent way to (selectively because of language) teach students about the elements of propaganda. The video I purchased was damaged, but the refund was prompt."
1,power,1st half of the movie views good last half of the movie dvd locks up and pixelates no matter what dvd player i play it on. i have two dvd's of this movie and both do the same.
1,Perfectly Awful,"A justly underrated Lumet vechicle, this by-the-numbers turkey explores the world of media interaction with politics during a political convention. Tries to capture the world of show business by looking at the race from different points of view from various politicians and throwing in some (mild) satirical moments, but it's pretentious, farfetched, and unintentionally funny."
3,"With this star-power, you know it's gotta be good.","Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, Richard Gere, JT Walsh and a host of other famous faces create an intense political picture. Gere is a political analyst/(person who makes a candidate look good) and he's running several campaigns. Gene Hackman is a nemesis, so-to-speak. Washington seems to meddling around in Gere's work and from there the abuse of power unfolds. This is a good film, I wouldn't say great due to long periods of slowness, but I do heartily reccommend this film."
4,Bought as a gift,I bought these for an friends elderly mom who LOVES to play cards but has some severe vision limitations. She was ever so grateful which made them worth 100 times what I paid for them!!
3,To Large Print,"After looking at the on line illustration I thought they could be to BOLD and sure enough they are for ""Texas-Hold_Em"". So can't use them. I know there are some available larger than standard, will look further."
5,Hoyle= Quality,"great quality cards, my mom greatly appreciates them , and they are extremely hard to find locally so getting them here is great."
5,Thank you for the large print!,"My husband has a neurological disorder which is accompanied by a visual disorder. He used to love playing cards, but has had great difficulty since his eyesight has gotten worse. I was really pleased to find these large print cards on Amazon, since I wasn't finding any large print cards in the stores. My husband was delighted with these cards with , and I have to admit that I like the large print, too!"
5,Great for Vision,These cards made it possible for someone with macular degeneration to be able to see them. This is the first time she has been able to do so. This is a great bennefit to her.
2,HOYLE SUPER JUMBO PLAYING CARDS,I am visually impaired and was happy to get the cards. They were very easy to read and others commented on them very positively. I needed them to be able to play EUCHRE in our card club. We play 6 rounds and they get a lot of shuffling. After the third day of using them they became very tacky and hard to deal. I can no longer use them. We normally use Bicycle cards and they stay good for a a long time. Not happy with this deck of cards and will have to find another brand so that I will be able to continue playing.
3,guess not a british music fan,the music on the cd is i guess good music but not enough of the songs that i like that i would buy it if i had to do over. if u like a lot or most of the british music u would love this cd
5,This book gives you what it says it will....,"The other reviews were right on the money. This book is a great find for someone that is looking to do some custom shades and/or curtains. Creativity has never been my strong suit. I am the type of person that moves into an apartment and keeps up the white blinds that are supplied. I buy curtains when necessary, but they are never ""eye-catching"". So when my husband and I decided to build our first house, I began to stress. I have not sewn since high school and I needed ideas. This book gave me that and more. The instructions are very thorough and easy to follow. The book also has great color pictures as well as fabric and color information. It is a great find for someone totally new to home design to a person that has been doing it for years. I think you will enjoy this book and find it is worth every penny."
4,Curtains & Shades: A Step-By-Step Guide to Creative Window T,"I am a decorator so this book will be a very useful tool in helping my clients seclect one or more of the many styles of shades shown in the book. For my needs,the instructions towards the back of the book on how to fabricate the different shades are not as important, but for the do-it-yourselfer....invaluable!"
2,Poor Sound,"Story OK. Main complaint is the quality of the print (purchased from Amazon). Casette labeled ""Hell House, 1934"" which is incorrect: It is ""Hell's House"" and it was produced in 1932. Print had numerous scratches and the soundtrack was very poor."
4,Women of Hawai'i,"The book is beautiful printed with some well known and lesser known works of the famous Hawaiian artist, Pegge Hopper, and probably the best painter of Polynesian women since Gauguin. Her paintings evoke a past Hawai'i of tranquility and pleasure.The book on Amazon cost much less than the Barnes and Noble store in Honolulu and it was in better condition than the shop worn single copy they had."
4,If you like Pegge Hopper you will enjoy this book.,"If you love Hawaii and it's people then you should treat yourself to this book. Pegge Hopper does a wonderful job of capturing the beauty and grace of Hawaiian women as well as the gorgeous flower and lei that are so abundant. I enjoyed reading about her journey, both physical and creative, that brought her to where she is today. I also loved seeing how her art progressed and changed over the years."
2,"Not what I thought is would be, but OK overall.","I found the material dated, but some of it was still good and valid for todays business enviroment."
4,CLASSIC CRAWFORD,"This movie actually contains a superior Joan Crawford performance. A beautiful example of a ""class picture"" from the M-G-M of 1937, this movie - surprisingly - wasn't quite successful enough on its own to pull Crawford out of the ""box-office poison"" category which plagued her in the late thirties. The movie is based on the Frederick Lonsdale evergreen, which was filmed previously in 1929 with Norma Shearer; the critics mostly agreed that this version was a definite improvement. Crawford got special praise for her smooth comedy playing (although she and Bill Powell had an odd chemistry) and the supporting cast was generally excellent. The Leon Gordon-Monkton Hoffe-Samuel Raphaelson script for producer Lawrence Weingarten made few alterations to the play about jewel theives in high society.... Director Richard Boleslawski, died suddenly while the film was still in production."
2,Film fluff for fans only!,"Character superstar Jessie Ralph steals the show in this otherwise stilted film version of a theatrical hit. So many of the great early 20th Century plays, translated into films (mostly by MGM!) stand up even today but unfortunately this isn't one of them... Perhaps it's the iconic Joan Crawford's presence...she's at the height of her haute-phoniness in this one, although she LOOKS spectacular.William Powell must have been fulfilling contractual obligations for appearing in this one...he's completely wasted.This film belongs to the character actors who comprise its supporting cast...notably the aforementioned Ralph and Nigel Bruce & Frank Morgan.Worth seeing as a time capsule of legendary silver screen personalities...otherwise forgettable."
4,Sprinkler pump,Has been operating satisfactory for several years. Hope it will continue for several more years. I do not have anything more to add.
5,VERY HAPPY WITH THE FLOTEC FP5172!!,"I ordered this sprinkler pump to replace my old pump that burnt out after a few hard-working years. I have never owned a Flotec pump, nor seen one for that matter. I received the product within 2 days of order, and it was well packaged and protected.Had it swapped out with old pump in a matter of 30 minutes + PVC drying time. Turned it on and noticed my sprinklers had a noticeable increase in output pressure and coverage, which will be great for my yard.Is running very quietly and efficiently - for many years I hope.GREAT PRODUCT!"
2,Decent,"It works decently for a natural children's product, for a little while anyway. After an hour, my daughter's wavy hair is a frizzy mess again."
3,love it,"This is a very cute story that anyone would love. Targeted more towards kindergarten and under, but who doesnt love a cute story. I would rreccommend this book to anyone."
4,serves a purpose,"As a preschool teacher of special needs kids, I'm in agreement with others that the text of this book is sort of stupid, but for preschoolers the saving grace is its repetition, alliteration and rhyme. The children quickly begin to repeat the goofy catch phrase and become engaged with the varied and poetic sounds of this otherwise nonsensical text."
5,good,my son enjoyed the book....we used it for my read a day at his school...they enjoyed it...glad he is starting to read
5,Christmas Gifts,I bought 2 of these for my grand niece and nephew. They are just beginning to read. Both were excited to get the books.
4,Fun book,"I was looking for a fun thanksgiving book for my son. He likes it, but he likes the five little pumpkins much better. Wish my son liked it more than he does."
4,Kiddo loved it,Good counting book and helped my son practice numbers with out him really knowing it. Cute little story. It seems like it goes on one page to long.
1,"Silly, and not in a good way.","I try to get my girls (ages 3 and 1.5)books for every holiday and saw the good reviews on this one. After reading it once, they had no interest in it and I can see it won't be one of the ones they want to read over and over. Not that I can blame them, the rhymes make no sense! There are many better Thanksgiving books out there, don't waste your money on this one."
2,Too Weird for my Toddlers,We thought this book was just too strange. The rhymes were very contrived--hope that makes sense. I'm going to donate it to the library in hopes others will check it out before purchasing it.
2,10 Fat Turkeys,"While the book is cute - it arrived with the binding bent and mangled. It was originally going to be a gift - it went into a pile of books headed for a preschool. I wish it had been mailed in at least a padded envelope.There are not very many fun books about Thanksgiving, and while the story line is really basic, the illustrations made me smile."
5,these turkeys entertain!,"My two and a half year old who hadn't sat willingly for a book in over six months will sit for this one again and again. For more fun we add sound effects for each page related to the action the turkey does (and Johnny does his own ""noodle dance""). The pages are now so battered we're looking for a replacement copy. If your kid is a fan of counting down, try this book on for size."
2,Didn't work for us,"English is a very difficult language to learn, and this book/cd did not work for us. It may work if you already know some English, but for beginners I don't think it's worth the money."
5,Tempered with Balance Scholarship,"The late FF Bruce has always been a thoughtful NT scholar. He is so thorough, and this volume reflects such. He has combined this scholarship of the NT world, his awareness of the relevant heavy hitters on the mentioned epistles, his adeptness of the biblical languages, and a pastoral flavor to produce a wonderful commentary."
5,Great CD,Wonderful CD. I have listened to it over & over again. It is timeless. Great CD to play when cooking a nice romantic Mexican meal...it takes you away to a little village in Mexico.
5,The best!,I listen to this everyday. How many recordings can you say that about?It scrubs off the stress in the first few minutes.Don't worry if you are intimidated by buying a CD that isn't in English. This CD truly transcends any language barrier. I know less than a hundred words and a few phrases of Spanish.Get it.
3,Eydie Gorme in all her glory!,"Combine the gorgeous voice of Eydie Gorme, with the talented music trio Los Panchos, and what do you get? Some of the most amazing, beautiful music ever recorded!Although she's best-known for her collaborations with husband Steve Lawrence, Miss Eydie Gorme also enjoyed a rich and popular partnership with the Los Panchos, and they recorded a few albums together; the best probably being 'Canta En Espanol'.On this album (remastered in stereo for the very first time), Eydie Gorme gets to wrap her sensuous, velvet voice around such pieces as ""Amor"", ""Sabor A Mi"", ""Noche de Ronda"", and ""Historia de un Amor"".Gorme's phrasing and accents are absolutely spot-on, and the arrangements from Los Panchos are very lush, suiting Gorme's vocals perfectly. For fans of Eydie Gorme, this would be a fine title.[Sony/CBS International CD-80193]"
5,"EYDIE AN ""LOS PANCHOS"" ARE FANTASTIK",IF YOU ENJOY THE OTHER WORKS OF EYDIE ANS LOS PANCHOS YOU CERTAINLY WILL ENJOY THIS ALBUM. HEARING THESE TUNES WILLBRING BACK THE NOSTALGIA THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS ONCE LOST!
4,"Incredible music, terrible transfer to CD","I would give this 5 stars....the performances are beyond outstanding.But who ever transferred the tapes to compact disc obviously didn't have his ears on that day. There is a low level distortion through out the copy of the disc I purchased. It's on all the tracks. I realize the tapes are probably not first generation masters, let's face it this album was recorded in the 1960's. But I wish that CBS or who ever was responsible for this reissue would have paid a little more attention to the quality of the audio.I'm trying not to let that ruin my enjoyment of the CD though. When you have a voice as incredible as Ms. Gorme's and the backing of Los Panchos how can you go wrong!Disclosure, I am an audio engineer and my first listen to this CD happened to be in the mixing studio where I work.This release deserves better from a technical quality standpoint. The music is beautiful!"
2,Look familiar?,"Does Grapple look familiar? He should- he shares most of his parts (including the head) with G1 Inferno; therefore much of my review for Inferno also applies here. This isn't neccesarily a good thing. That means mostly plastic construction and flaky chrome. Grapple has an additional demerit in the fact that he replaces Inferno's tight, telescoping ladder with a crane that loosely moves in and out- meaning it just kind of hangs down in robot mode and does not keep its place in vehicle mode. Again, I'll have to say not to buy this or any other G1 reissue for anyone who isn't a collector due to fragility issues."
2,NOT for kids - G1 for collectors only,"My 6 year old really wanted this for Christmas. We didn't know that the G1's are Generation One. That means they are the very first original transformers. Great for a collector, but not for kids. The G1's don't even come close to measuring up to the new transformers. They are very generic & you even have to put the decals on them.Very overpriced & NOT for kids!"
1,Okay B Movie but from a horrible video source!,"This is a typical 68 minute B movie about a dynamite crew, produced by Pine-Thomas and originally released by Paramount. It's an okay action programmer but the video source is absolutely pathetic, the worst I've seen from Alpha which is saying quite a bit. It looks like it was recorded on VHS at EP speed off broadcast TV (probably from a UHF station that ran it at 3:00 am). Apparently Alpha has no minimum quality standards. They will release absolutely anything from any source if it's in the public domain. I don't expect perfection from this sort of material but I don't expect garbage either. Some of the Alpha DVDs are quite good, many more are acceptable but this one is the pits!"
4,Interesting but Vauge.,"Although this book covers a good portions of the happenings in the Atlanic during World War II, questions remain unanswered. It doesn't go deep into the subject. But unlike other book on this subject, it doesn't just scratch the surface either."
4,From the Book Meister,"I thought this was a pretty good book. The stories of the 25 young women were fun to read, and that inspirational ending was very helpful. I would definitely recommend this book to young ladies who are feeling bad about themselves or lost in life. Some of the stories were really cool, and makes me think of what I could do in my life. But overall this was a good book."
3,Guts,"In this book, Gutsy Girls, you will find that the girls have a lot of guts. I recommend this book to girls who love sports because it is about sports. One of the parts I liked was Beth Rodden's story. She was a rock climber and she said that rock climbing doesn't only include physical strength it also requires mental strength."
2,Its ok,I like it but its a little bulky. Cd's can definetly not get damaged if thats what your looking for.
2,Scared Stiff,"This is not the same movie as Scared Stiff with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis...I purchased it several years ago and thought it might be the Martin/Lewis production. Don't ask me why, especially since the cover art states the actors but,somehow, I thought that there might have been a mistake in the artwork versus the actual movie. My mistake!!As for the movie, this is a typical B/C grade Hollywood filler meant for mild amusement before the big feature-or perhaps a Saturday matinee. The acting is okay but I think my initial disappointment of getting the 'wrong' movie still clouds my review. Production quality seems quite poor; may have been from a poor-quality transfer. Lots of pops/clicks, etc."
1,Boy is my face red!!!,"Well, I must say, I'm so embarrassed. I bought this film, not thinking it was the old Jerry Lewis movie, of the same name, but one of ill repute. I find it quite enjoyable to pick up a ""blue"" movie now and again, to enjoy on the weekend, when I don't have any female accompaniment. Imagine my surprise, when instead of getting ""stiff,"" I got stiffed on the ""stinky"" movie that was included in this tripe! What a load of rhinoceros droppings.Let me tell you, I will never again turn to an online ordering firm for my weekend ""stag"" movie needs. Let me tell you!Two thumbs down!!!"
5,A life larger than pain,A Life Larger Than PainI really enjoyed reading such an insightful book. I was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus at 15 and I have struggled with pain and living with a chronic condition for 11 years. This book has given me new tools to use in managing my disease and the pain that goes along with it. I love how it touches on both the physiological pain that is felt along with the psychological pain and it explains how the two go hand in hand. I felt that this book was clear in its purpose and was written to be a resource for anyone dealing with pain and also for family members caring for someone who is experiencing pain. Kudos to Dr. Hinds for thinking outside the box.
5,A transendental look at pain.,"As a non-clinical person, I entered this book with trepidation. But what a pleasure of a read it was. It takes the concept of pain, which one typically only perceives of in the immediate physical sense, and explains this physically, emotionally, metaphysically and spiritually. This is a book for people with any type of pain - from the body, the heart or the soul - and will breath new life into you. There was obviously a great deal of time and effort put into these limited pages. I will share this with my closest friends. The annecdocal case studies referenced in the book allow one to understand the authors point from both the person with the pain and the healer. This book is just plain good for the soul."
2,good watch bad band,"I have had this watch for about a year and it has taken a beating and kept going. It had a lot of nice features. The bad part is that the watchband is very non-standard and I cannot get a replacement even from Casio. But for 15 bucks, which is what I paid for it, I cannot complain too much. My advice is to either buy a Casio watch with a standard band, which is what I replaced this one with, or if you love it just buy a new one, even if you could find the band it is probably the same price as the watch anyway."
4,Good watch bad band,I bought this watch from Walmart in Sep 2004 and the band started to wear out around Jan 2008 and broke off in March 2008 so I got 3 + years of use for $16.00Casio markets the watch with a 10 year battery which is useless since you cant get a standard band to fit on it since this one uses a novel band with screws which I must admit is a lot easier to replace provided you can find one. All on all it is a good watch with excellent display. I dont much care about reading the time in the dark since there are very few places you dont have light and all cars have clocks and in movie theaters is works fine.
2,Mixed review,There are 3-4 variations on the W96H design. Great looking watch with all the functions I wanted. But the deal killer is the watch band. It is held in by screws and cannot be replaced by a generic watch band. You have to buy genuine Casio and it was $15 at eBay. So more cost effective to get a new W96H type watch. My watch band failed after 10 months while most Casios I have owned take 2-3 years for that to breakSo on to a new model. Just bought the W-800H-1AV which also has a 10 year battery but will take a generic replacement watch band so that when it fails I'll get a Velcro wrap around for it.First digital I ever bought was Casio 25 years ago.Then eight years ago I tried Timex Iron man and Expedition. I use diff functions a lot and doing this runs down the batteries quickly on these. Plus illumination takes too much juice. So now it is back to Casio and 10 year batteries. Just have to buy the right one
2,Watch band breaks in about 1 year,"I have used two of this watch, and for both the band broke in about 1 year."
3,its small for Big hands,its ok for normal hands but like big hands its ok but it will be better for them .. any way it amazing
3,Product is OK.,Product seems to work fine and is good value for price. It is alittle hard to read the display from an angle.
2,Band does not fits large wrists,"I like the Casio watches, but the bands on a lot of their watches are not long enough for me. This is not just a Casio issue. I normally purchase the 3240 w-800h because the band will fit my wrist. I tried this one just to have a different watch this time, but like I said the band was to short. Had to ship it back to Amazon.I can not say enough about the good services from Amazon."
4,"Watch is great, strap is not...","I have purchased this watch a few times and the watch is great, but the strap breaks and costs about as much as a new watch. I think it is funny that it says ""10 year battery"" on the face of the watch. It has a battery that lasts for 10 years and a strap that only lasts for 2 years!"
5,Casio Men's Watch,This watch does everything I need it for. It's rugged and reliable. That's why I bought this watch again. Also love the 10 year warranty on the battery.
1,I do not have recived this item yet,"Please help me this item never recived, what hapen with importing company; I need another company for importing my orders to México, please help me to found this new company, I don not want to work more with the current company, because I have had many losses with them, tell me the steps that I needs to follow for found a new importing company, thanks."
2,Not as much as I expected,"I didn't find this book especially helpful. I chose it because it supposedly gave you ideas of how to help and was written by a man. I was looking for more concrete examples of what to do when a man you love is grieving. I felt the suggestions were common sense and vague. Scanning through the second half of the book, for men who are grieving themselves, it looks like it may be more helpful, but since i'm not a grieving man, I couldn't say for sure."
4,Amazing,Im doing a research paper about jane goodall- my life with the chimps and this website helped a lot. thank you!
1,Low pressure cut-off is a fuss,"If you need to use this on an agriculture water well, get the version WITHOUT low pressure cut off (looking at my spare one its marked SQ-D 9013FSG2J20). Also this version is MORE prone to problems in near freezing weather, also if you must field adjust PSI this device has multiple springs and is a bear to keep in the working range.There are other ways to protect against leak issues, This causes more problems than it solves. As someone pointed out the contacts only last around 12-18 months. So buy many, and use a open prong wire ends to aid in fast replacement. They are rumored make a version with more robust contacts, still looking for it!"
4,Almost perfect,"It was great to find a pressure switch with a low cut off.I have had several irrigation pumps lose a prime for one reasonor another. And of course the pump still ran and the end results ,a burnt up pump head.Repairing the pump in theneighborhood of $45.00 to $65.00 and time.I installed this square D switch in a system that I have had alot of problemswith.With in the first week, it save the pump head from over heating .I love it ,but there is one thing I wish it would do.Iwish it would let you adjust the low cut out pressure more than the 10lbs. differance that it is set up for.If it would letyou adjust it more ,I would have rated it a five star.But in all it is a great switch and I would reccommend it highly to anyone .I will be buying more."
5,Safety Pressure Switch,"This low pressure cut off switch solved a problem we had at a remote pump. The pump at times due to agricultural pumping in the area would lose its prime causing it to run for a long period of time before being discovered. This switch shuts the pump off and saves it from damage.The down side is that water usage at this site sometimes exceeded the pump output for a short time. This caused a temporary low pressure condition that also shut the pump off. To compensate, I restricted the output from the pump somewhat and everything is fine. This switch has most likely saved our pump."
5,Don't be so sad,"In this start of the Stars series, Darien, Usagi's(Sailor Moon) Boyfriend, lover and friend is going off to Harvard college for a year. Of course she's upset( I would too, he's so gorgeous) anyway as she sees him off at the airport he tells her something very special for the first time and gives her something too, but moments after he dissapears right before her eyes, and her being so shocked she faints and forgets what really happened. After that a lot of strange things start happening. These new mysterious guys start school with her and each one of her friends and comrads have been dissapearing right before her eyes, and that's not even the beggining.....if you want to know what happens keep reading...it's worth it especially the last book(3rd one). (...)"
4,Usagi's in trouble,"Just when things finally settled down in their messed up world,Usagi and the rest find themselves face-to-face with another enemy and Usagi is hit the hardest. Most of the senshi (minus three) die right before her eyes. She constantly tries to block out the memories and basically goes insane when she realizes that her friends are dead. I had to read it a couple of times to get just about everything that happens in this book and I would suggest everyone else doing the same. It really helps you to spot out things that you missed."
5,A Great Beginning to a Great Series,"This series-Sailor Moon Stars, is by far one of the best of Naoko Takeuchi's wonderful works. Although this first volume may be bewildering at the beginning, all of the questions a reader might have are eventually answered, or left to common-sense sooner or later.This first book out of three is an interesting one, and necessary to understand the entire story.I reccomend this book because it has a brilliant story, good action, fantastic art, great suspense, and many other elements that contribute to its entertaining aura. This is a great beginning to the Stars arc."
4,Sailor Moon Stars,"This book was kind of hard to follow, but it had a great story to it. Without Darian it lacked the huge romance, but when the three lights appear, you totally forget about Darian. So with the zillions of new enemys and the rushing plot, and Nako's great art (which she seems to have streched to her limits), this is a GREAT book, and I really reccomend it. Be sure to get the second one! And when it comes out, the third one, and so on and so on!"
5,"A must read, no matter what anyone says!","Naoko is back with the last and best series! I am totally hooked to this book, and no matter how many times I read it, I find something new that I missed. All my friends have loved them, and I can't wait until I get #3! I personaly think the graphics in this seires are much better than the earler books...Oh, and the coolest characters, the Starlights, finally appear! Definately better than the Anime!"
3,Very nice.. but.. confusing.. ^^;,"Okay, I'll say off the bat, you have to get it! But it's not my favorite, I liked the SuperS series better. Don't get me wrong! I LOVE Stars!.. But the way they did the manga.. it.. well.. is just really hard to read.. it's like: Usagi and Mamoru are walking *FLASH!* Mamoru is being melted, *SWOOSH!* Usagi is in another universe looking at an evil shadow, then, out of nowhere *KLANK KLANK* and she wakes up and suddenly realizes, she hda already dropped Mamoru off, and was back home the next day! I mean.. you have to read it QUITE a few times.. >.< Too many black-outs where she dreamt something about someone, and then it was a week later, getting mysterious mail.. O.o ... just get it. ^^;; you WILL enjoy it.. ^^;; heehee!..."
3,Crappy Price Ratings,"lol actually, no, i'm not under 13, but i don't know my stupid dad's password so otherwise i can't review (i'm 17 ^_^0) anyhoo, plz everyone, don't buy for these ridiculous prices! $100?! are they completely insane?! i got mine for like $7 from here, and they should never be more than $10. so, nobody buy a book for $100... they're crazier than loons if they think anybody's actually going to pay that. anyhoo, but yeah, i guess i'll review the book, since that's what this is for and all... pretty good book, although i found myself really disappointed by the starS series in comparison to the rest of the story. unless usagi is your fav. character, don't expect to see your fav. one(s). that's it, it was still good, though; it just was not as good, ya know?"
4,Naoko Takeuchi has done it again!,"Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon Stars #1 is one of the best mangas she did in the Sailor Moon series. Bunny & her friends have a new villian to face. This series is a fan favorite, all sailor moon fans, all ages, will LOVE!! So buy a copy of it."
5,Sailor Moon Volume 16,"Wow! Finally this book came out! Anyways, it starts off with Darien leaving for Havard. Right when Darien is getting ready to leave a strange woman shows up in a gold metal suit. Bunny is extremely surprised to see her and cannot act before Darien crumbles into ashes. Bunny faints and we see 3 more men behind her. The one catches her and the other mutters, ""Too late."" The story goes on a little more and a little girl with heart-shaped odangos falls from the sky with an umbrella. Who's she... The first villian, Sailor Iron Mouse, appears and is killed in a few pages. The next villian, Sailor Aluminum Siren, appears and Jupiter and Mercury also turn to ash. The same thing is done to Mars and Venus by Red Crow (Originally Lead Crow. That bothers me :P) I'm not going to give alway who the Starlights are, but I will tell you that one of their attacks is changed from 'Star Gentle Uterus' to 'Star Gentle Creator' (In my opinion it is a change for the better). -Sailor Pluto-"
5,Have your SM dictionary handy! (Or the art books)^^;,"I liked it, very good and all. The cover thingy, yes that confused me at the time as mine that I bought in Edmonton has a different cover from the Amazon sold one. ... Anywho, I love the story, yes, have your mind very awake and read it over a few times if you don't know the story. Watched the subtitled anime first and loved that too. I was confused by the covers and thought there was to be 4 star mangas but it seems there is only 3. Oh well, only two more to go for me!!! Buy it! I've been collecting them since two years ago. Definetly a good wait. ^^"
5,Great!,I love this wallet. It is comfortable and environmentally friendly. I've been using it for almost a year now and no signs of wear/tear.
3,"Inaccurate, unsophisticated, hyperbolic, and fun","This is the story of the discovery, loss, and subsequent rediscovery of a series of prehistoric underwater stone structures in a Wisconsin Lake. By his own admission the author took time from writing a book about Atlantis in order to write this one, and the tales he spins and conclusions he draws here are every bit as fanciful, although the writing is, on the surface, so dispassionate that you wouldn't suspect such. Still, the history of the pyramids is exciting and interesting, and his subsequent international sleuthing to find the ultimate source of this strange civilization is also great fun, although highly dubious both from the standpoint of archaeology and history. But who cares? We had fun reading Eric Van Daniken and did learn a lot from him, even if we don't want to admit it. The smooth writing pulls you along on this adventure, so enjoy the ride. Just approach it all - even the details - with skepticism."
1,A novel masquerading as an archaeological work,"Joseph's book is interesting, but only as a piece of fantasy. His jumps in logic are enormous and difficult to believe as a serious work of science. Certainly, there are more intelligent and reasonable explanations for pyramids in Rock Lake, that could be answered by scientific investigation. Linking civilizations of the New World with the Canary Islands and Egypt are yet another attempt to trivialize the important and complex communities that have existed in North America for centuries. This book definately has entertainment value, but that is all it has to offer and should not be taken for more."
2,Too expensive,If you will do a little searching for this part you can find it for around 60.00 on some other sites. Good luck
1,Horrid Transfer!,"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound. This is in reference to the Alpha DVD release. The Movie gets 3 to 4 stars from me personally."
2,Not too helpful,"I read this book to help my daughter who is slightly overweight. I didn't even keep it in my library. If your child has an obesity problem, or if you just have no idea what healthy eating is this book will help you, but to be honest there were many times while reading it that I just had to say ""duh!"" I was looking for some insight beyond simple common sense. My family doesn't eat fast food three times a week and spend hours watching TV every day. If you have a child that seems to be active and eats a well balanced diet, but still is overweight I would not recommend you looking to this book for an answer."
5,A true life changer,"Misters Lau and Glossbrenner, with a big assist to George Brett, have re-invented the wheel and made water wetter with this ""must-have"" book. Put it to use and watch your love of the game explode."
2,did not match picture,The girth was actually shorter than my current 52 inch and the picture of the girth did not match perfectly what I received. There are two metal parts that the elastic is hooked on that I feel could possibly put pressure on my horses side. I would not have purchased this girth if I had seen the metal parts.
2,Gold Coins of the World From Ancient Times to The Present,"Fist of all for 75$ I would have expected the catalogue to be in color not only the cover and the back...Secondly for Ancient coins such as Greek, Roman & Byzantine, It would have helped if an approximate weight for each coin was included..."
2,No color pictures,"Fist I would say for 75.00 , I would expect color when it comes to showing gold coins in a hard bound edition. The only color is on the paper cover. The book lacks depth in the largest market for collectors, U.S.A. . Not impressive !"
1,Buy another book.,The book is poorly constructed and lacks a lot of acient middle eastern gold coins. The lack of color also makes me feel that I over paid for this book.
3,A must have book for world coin collectors,"who specialize in gold coins minted prior to 1600. It would have been much better if the photos would have been in color. In todays new coin business and hobby it's essential to communicate not only the basic design of a coin but also it's unique look and that means color and high quality digital pictures. We are learing in the trade that these color photos are an essential part of the business, and students and collectors of coins want research material that also accurately portrays coins as well. Still a necessary book for the collector as well as advanced Numismatic library, let's hope we see a new release that we can all be happy with."
1,After playing Crystal Key,"after being disappointed by the ending, annoyed by the cheesiness of the plotand the over-simple puzzles...Who would want to play a sequel?!?"
2,A below-par generic adventure game,"Sturgeon's law states that 95% of everything is crap. I think he was optimistic - for every Hamlet, there are bezillions of sitcoms; For every Ring Cycle, there are several cubic yards of mindless MTV pap.And for every Myst, or Syberia, there are far too many games like Crystal Key 2.Crude and muddy graphics, pointless story line, endless exposition, and illogical puzzles based on the tried and trusted technique of 'search everywhere until you are frustrated; talk to everyone many times over; try everything in your inventory, in combination if necessary'No redeeming features, as far as I can see...."
1,Disappointing....,"I anxiously pre-ordered the game from the Adventure Company ($20) since I totally enjoyed the first Crystal Key (that game got me hooked on PC games).What a disappointment! I had technical difficulties to start with and the game play was awful. I will admit the graphics are good and the story line is so-so, but the jumping back-and-forth to locations and trying to figure out the next steps is extremely tedious.Eventually I finished the game, but only because I hate giving up on something (even if it is bad!).Not worth the money."
1,not worth the money,"Completely disjointed, bad graphics, stiff characters, obscure puzzles. And I paid $39.99 by pre-ordering from Amazon.ca and saw it on EB's shelf 2 days before I got my copy from Amazon, for $19.99!!!!! $20.00 cheaper!!!! Live and learn....And it's not even worth the $19.99 IMO. Save your money."
4,Enjoyable Game,"Overall, this game was good and I enjoyed it very much. The graphics had a few problems sometimes, the whole scene would develop kind of line through it, and then it would adjust, but for the most part, they were good. This was a sequel to the first Crystal Key and the storyline indicated that throughout the game. I would not class this game with, for instance, a Myst game, for realism and beauty of scenery, but I have seen much less realistic settings in other games. The voices and acting were o.k. and fitting with the story and location of the adventure. Some of the characters were very funny and likeable. The puzzles were just challenging enough to keep interest in continuing the adventure. I think this game is well worth playing and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good game that is not on the serious side."
4,Try it!,I purchased a copy some time back and use it all the time. It saves me hours tracking down the images and graphics that I need to use.After reading the other reviews I would suggest people visit the Extensis site for all the information they need. You could try a demo version!Cheers
1,what is it??,what does this software do? all i see is how much it cost and when it ships. if i am buying software just to see how much software i can buy then this is all i need to know. but if i want useful software then i need to know what it does before i get it!!!
1,Rechargeable Battery for Nintendo Wii Remote,"I purchased two of the rechargeable battery packs and after hours and hours of charging them, neither worked. I spoke with a representative for the company that made them and they told me that they'd send me another pair after making sure that they worked, but I have not received them. Looked good on paper, but if they aren't going to work, I'll just stick with AAs."
2,You get what you pay for,"They may be cheap, but you'll be lucky to get more than 4 hours from them. I would advise spending a little more on a good brand."
3,Anne's Review,I did not like the rechargeable that I ordered. It came with a wire to attach to the back of the Wii Control. What I thought I ordered was the batteries that you can recharge on the remotes. Anyway they did not hold a charge and I will be sending them back. Unfortunately I was not satisfied with this purchase.
2,Wonderful classics mangled by missing pictures -- avoid!,"Lionni's original books are breathtaking classics -- wonderful stories that carefully pace each line with gorgeous succulent visuals. But this 'treasury' chops out more than half the original pictures, omitting favorite images, destroying the page-turning pace and in some cases the stories no longer even make sense. This 'treasury' is no bargain -- you'd be better off with one or two of the original unabridged masterpieces. I yearned to see the beautiful 2-page art of ""a forest of seaweeds growing from sugar-candy rocks"" in _Swimmy_ but was sad to find it missing."
5,A must for your collection!,This compilation of stories is completely delightful. They warm your heart and put a smile on your face. My husband used to read them to me when I was SO pregnant I could not sleep. And now we continue to read them to our wonderful daughter Lucy. I get this book as a present for all my pregnant friends. It is a must for your collection.
1,Hanger Review Redux,"It appears that this product was relabeled from the ""USP Structural Connectors JUS26-TZ G185-Triple Zinc Galvanized Face Mount Joist Hanger, 2 by 6, (Pack of 100)"" label it carried when I ordered, and they folded in the shipping cost (original had shipping cost for 1 hanger three times the unit cost, and only a single hanger arrived despite the label), but you can get better hardware at substantially reduced unit cost elsewhere (100 equivalent or better hangers for less than $80 with shipping online). Biggest ripoff ever from this site, not a good experience by any stretch. Already reviewed earlier, but appreciate the opportunity to corroborate that opinion..."
2,Company That's Overstayed It's Welcome,"I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with corporate rock (my collection of Foreigner and Journey CD's will attest to that), but ""Holy Water"" is certainly one of the more bland offerings in that much maligned subgenre. I guess if you're familiar with any of the singles from this album and you like them, go ahead and pick it up because you're guaranteed more of the same. If that still doesn't scratch your itch, pick up ""Fame And Fortune"" (1986), ""Dangerous Age"" (1988), and ""Here Comes Trouble"" (1992). You'll be well on your way to having a CD collection that is the musical equivalent of Cheez Whiz."
4,"I agree with ""The Best Pure Rock Album Ever""","I agree with the reviewer that said ""The Best Pure Rock Album Ever."" Maybe not the best pure rock album ever, but definitely a collection of great songs. I keep seeing reviews for the newer Bad Company music saying it's bland, boring, not creative, etc. I disagree with all of those reviewers. The newer Bad Company is a whole different band, playing beautiful, strong rock/pop ballads. The songs have a lot of feeling and conviction in them--and this is coming from someone who loves all the old Bad Company too. I enjoy the two different types of music individually. Check out ""If You Needed Somebody."""
5,GREAT CD,I LIKE BAD COMPANY ! GREAT CD ! VERY HAPPY TO HAVE !! IT TAKES ME BUT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP !!
5,An Album That Testifies To The Power Of The Individual,"HOLY WATER is an album that testifies to an individual's determination to get what he/she wants/needs/deserves. The album features numerous songs with great lyrics about taking as much control over one's fate as possible, even if others strongly disagree with what your intentions are. Of course, some kids who took this album's messages too literally ended up in special schools because of it, but overall, this CD is a great example of an album whose songs are connected yet not connected."
3,A competent follow up...,"A relatively strong album,'Holy Water'continues along the lines of its predecessor,'Dangerous Age'(1988)in terms of decent songwriting,especially the ballads where Brian Howe's good vocal skills really show,but it lacks the freshness and the power punch of the latter."
3,Ok album of theirs...some known songs,Yeoman's effort to reclaim their earlier radio-heavy listening with some songs memorable for the airwaves...tough to develop and cultivate a new sound.
1,Awful,"I was very disappointed with my purchase. I realize That I am buying a used product but, it was described as (MINT CONDITION) that to me means like new. The CD is full of scratches, starts skipping on the very first song. I did not complain to the seller, I feel they should know what they are selling and if they need to beat someone for seven bucks then they need the money more then I do!!! I would not buy from this seller again."
1,What's that sh.t ? ! ?,"Ils n'avaient déjà pas su faire un 5ème album (NDLR : ""Desolation Angels"") mais ici, c'est consternant de nullité ! rien d'autre à ajouter. Hélas..."
4,Not bad,"One of the better albums to come out in the early 90s! True, this will never be the same style Bad Company we got in the 70s. I think trying to compare the two Bad Company's is like night and day. I think you should just take what each one has to offer and rock!"
3,Bad Company is Paul Rodgers,"Being about 30 years old now this album was how I was introduced to Bad Co. The songs were good and fit the time. None of them stood the test of time like the songs on the first few Bad Co records, that is obvious because we can't escape them today 30 years later. The title track is the best song on the CD followed by the heavy blues number Stranger, Stranger. There is a bland love ballad that I'm sure everyone over the age of 20 has heard (If you needed somebody), how did Bryan Adams get on this record? The big problem with this 1990 release is by the time you get to track 6 or 7 you have heard the whole record. There really is no stand out track after 5. If you were to come up with a best of CD of all the Brian Howe era bad company CD's you'd have a bunch of really good songs that all sound the same, well, a few slower ballads and some real good rockers. Maybe someone will release that, until then get the 4 CD's including this one."
5,Use on a hard surface,I use this ball with a laser pointer and really give my cat a workout. Kitteh has a hard time nailing down the ball because of the randomness of it's bounces. Excellent purchase.
3,Cat toy,Not as pictured. I bought it for the rainbow color shown in the picture. The ball I received is solid colored.
2,small,"lot smaller than expected, cats dontwant to play with them. Wont buy these again. dont waste your time or money"
2,Not so good. . .,"These cats toys are not so good. At least not for my girls.The only reason I am giving 2 stars, (instead of one), is because Hailey (my Maine Coone), pushed one around for the first 10 minutes.But these Atomic Balls could not even keep the attention of my very spirited Bengal.Both of my girls are almost 7 now, so maybe this is a toy for kittens?"
3,There are different versions of this product...be careful,"The ball pictures is the multi-colored ball. I have had that one in the past, and it is softer and has more bounce than the one I received. The package I received contained 2 bouncing balls that are a solid color and have a little less bounce.Not all my cats play with this ball. But the ones that do absolutely love it. One of them will pick it up, bring it to me, and drop it in front of me. Then he plays fetch every time I throw it."
3,Didn't work for my cat,"The first surprise was to see that the balls were of a solid color (one green, one yellow) instead of the multicolored ball shown in the picture. The second was that my cat showed absolutely no interest in them, though she loves other balls she has. If we throw this ball she is likely to chase it for a second, but once she sees which ball it is she will go back to completely ignoring it."
2,My cats didn't go for these,My cats didn't go for these. They much prefer the spring toys that have a continuous motion once batted around
2,Somewhat Interesting,"Solotaroff spent six years working on the book - focusing on the ""Death Belt"" (two hours from I-10 in the South) relating stories from an amateur historian of executions, to former death-rom inmates, condemned, and executioners. Also included are short stories of inane corrections staff ""humor"" directed at terrifying those being tried in capital and other cases, and the struggles and pain of those being executed.Not clear what the point was, if any. Bill Kurtis' ""The Death Penalty on Trial"" was much more useful reading."
2,I don't understand why it takes so long for delivery,"I ordered this magazine May 16, 2012 and the estimated delivery date is July 11, 2012. This is rediculous I have purchased several items after this and have received everything. I do not understand that is almost 2 months delivery time. I know that this states that it comes with a free kindle version but hmmmm I don't own a kindle. Unfortunatly this is the only way I was able to get this magazine subscription, there was no option for magazine only. I would not suggest getting this subscription for you or anyone else unless you are fortunate enough to have a kindle.Sorry for the rant but I think this is REDICULOUS!"
4,Max Rules,Suprisingly fun little movie. Kids especially will love it. Parents won't be tortured watching it either.
3,Good attempt,"This suspenseful and humorous child detective movie came across as an amateur movie, with directing, screenwriting, and acting falling a little short. It's not a bad movie, though, and those involved have potential. It's very clean (we even have a ""gosh""), but I wouldn't call the main character's staging a food fight and forging his uncle's signature role model behavior for impressionable young kids."
4,bee movie game,"the bee movie game was alot like the movie but not as funny. my son and i played the movie and i was surprised at how well the graphics,and game strategies were a little challenging. my 10 year old son loves this game."
3,Not good,I purchased this game for my 5 year daughter and she does not like it at all. It is difficult for her to understand the concept which makes it boring for her. My 12 year old likes it but the game is not made for younger kids.
2,Kids don't even play it,The kids love the movie but the concept of the game is not so great. It's a bit difficult for them to play and the concept of the game is not very interesting for them. They don't play it at all.
3,Not as easy as it would seem,"This game is hard to work for small children. My son is 4 and he is the one who wanted it but I find myself being the one playing to help him out and it is still confusing to me to locate the different places where you are supposed to go to get to the next levels. It's not really self explanatory, which would make it easier to figure out."
2,eh...,"This game didn't hold my daughter's (or my) attention. There was nothing really special about the game, though it was cute, and movement of the character was frustrating at times. It was played all of 3 times and has now been sitting at the back of our game cabinet untouched for a year. A younger child (my daughter was 9 when we bought this) may enjoy the gameplay a bit more as the game is enjoyable visually, but the controls would be even more frustrating for them."
3,OK album,"I don't listen to this now as much as I did after purchase. Have to be in the mood for his music, but still a good album."
2,Forgotten If Not Gone,"A forgettable toy rapper best known for the catchy racist anthem La Raza, Kid Frost is deservedly forgotten. D"
4,Nice Upgrade for Older Dell E521,"I swapped out the stock AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ for this 5600+. My Win 7 WEI jumped from a 4.7 score for my CPU to a 5.9. This also boosted my RAM WEI from 4.7 to 6.4. My E521 really performs much faster overall. I uninstalled iTunes and all my music files, reinstalled fresh iTunes and added the music files back. iTunes really, really performed much much better. The MP3 to AAC file conversion was truly rapid. Finally, a nicely capable CPU to address the iTunes demand for more processing power."
1,EXTREMELY unsatisfied,"I was shipped the wrong product. For anyone out there who are familiar with computers, you know that a processor for your computer and motherboard have to be EXACT. Then, after recieving the product, I was told there was a no return policy. If I could give this merchant a 0 star, I would have."
3,Good 4 Younger Kids,"I really liked Ramona and her Father but I thought it was a little boring. I thought that because the reading level is lower then what I expected w/ me being a 6th grader and the fact that my reading level is already high. That is why I advise maybe grades 3 and 4 to read it; maybe advanced 2nd graders. They will enjoy this book a lot. All together I think it is a good book, but not for my age level. I really think that the way Beverly Cleary writes is funny and that 3rd and 4th graders will really enjoy it."
3,If only we had a million dollars...,"Well as they say, ""Money can't buy happiness"". Ramona thinks it can, well it can but it doesn't have to in this case. Mr. Quimby losing his job was tough on the whole family, especially Ramona. She couldn't do anything about it if she tried. Her father let her know they're trying to be a perfect family and surely enough this reflects back to my family. When my father lost to someone else for this ""government"" job, it was tough on me. I wanted to get a job, raise money, anything just to see my father happy. We aren't the perfect family and neither is Ramona's. That's why I can relate so much to her."
4,Satisfying,"Ramona's father has been laid off, and she desperately wishes she could go on TV and earn a million dollars to support her family. (""Even one dollar would help."") What she does instead is get burrs in her hair, a compulsion to stop her father from smoking, and some trouble in the second grade. This book is worth the Newbery Medal it earned, and it brings the Quimby family out of the fifties quite satisfyingly."
3,Good 4 younger kids,"This boook is ok, but the reason I disliked it was because of the younger aged vocabulary. I am in 6th grade so the vocabulary bored me to death especially since I have an already higher reading level than a normal 6th grader. I suggest this book to grades 3 and 4 the most maybe advanced 2nd grader."
5,Ramona and Her Father,Ramona and Her Father is a great book. I especially liked the part when Ramona got burrs in her hair. When they tried to get the burrs out they couldn't. I think that this book is good because it's full of adventures.
3,Good Book,This is a great book about a girl and her relationships with her father. She tries to help her father with his struggles when he lost his job. This is a great book and I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,Ramona and her Father,"Wow! That book was fantastic! I could not put the book down! It was so wonderful. I give this book five dazzling stars. The story takes place at the Quimby's house with Ramona, the daughter, and her father. When Ramona's father loses his job he picks up smoking. So Ramona and her sister Bessuze try to make him stop by putting up signs. But it does not always work. I really think you should read this marvelous book."
5,"True,warm hearted,and funny.",Ramona just wanted evryone to be happy again. If only her father would laugh and joke again. Her mother would look less worried. Her sister would be more cheerful.And Picky Picky (their cat) would eat his cat food.Read about the Laugh your eyeballs out ways Ramona tries to gether family happy again.This ia a newbery book just read it and see why.Faith Hill (herself)
5,A very good album,One of Julio Iglesias best albums where you like all the songs on the CD. This is one of those.
3,Julio is again a favorite on this collection of latin songs.,"The different flavors of music make this CD a must on Julio's collection. His rendition of a Peruvian Waltz and also ""Un Hombre Solo"" is a delicious ballad that gives his unique sounds and interpretations. Arrangements are some of the best from his wide repertoire."
1,Crap,This product didn't work at all. Put Driver CD in and then you are left wondering what to do to utilize the drivers. Simply not worth the time or money.
4,I got what I ordered,I got what I wanted and what I ordered. This is original equipment made for my color printer. I am happy with this transaction
2,Too Boring,"Unlike the first Mysterious Journey, this game TOO many puzzles and is very boring. If you want to play a game for hours and days without getting anywhere, then this game is for you. I do nothing but workout and play games with my spare time, and this game isn't worthy of that time. I've played games like aliens vs predator 2, eternal darkness, rez evil, tomb raider, so I have plenty of patience when it comes to gaming. The graphics are stunning, but that's it for me. If you don't have the first game, then get it instead."
1,Mysterious Dud!,"I have never written a review before but this game is so bad that I wanted to warn people! I am a college graduate and have played a great many adventure games. If you are not a math and game playing geek, I suggest you read the cheat sheets at Gameboomers. Com to see what you will be getting yourself into before you invest anything in Mysterious Journey 2. The puzzles are continuous and so convoluted that you will spend hours and hours doing nothing but trial and error. There is nothing clever or original about any puzzle in this game. The good graphics are wasted. The characters are at best stupid and the story line is mediocre. By the way, if you do not understand base numbers, you probably will not understand even the cheat sheet. If you loved Syberia, than you will be very disapointed with this dud."
1,"Uh, Barf!!","I just installed this game and played it for 5 minutes and I literally want to throw up. The graphics are awesome and the game looks like it would be really fun, if it weren't for the 1st person navigation system. This full 360 degree viewing is totally gross. it's like you are inside a sphere, and when you move the mouse the sphere rolls the screen around, so every single thing you want to look at requires the entire screen to move, at a disgusting rate. i slowed the mouse movement down as far as it would go but it was still like i was on a rollercoaster. Have you ever seen clockwork orange? you know how they forcefeed the guy images to cure him and he freaks out, well that's how i felt after 5 seconds of game play. 15 minutes later now, and i still have motion sickness. give me still images please!!"
2,Not for most,"I was pretty disappointed with this game and definitely regret buying it. I like adventure games to a point, but this one is pretty much just for hardcore puzzle fans. Some of the puzzles will require you to sit for hours writing formulas and graphs to try and figure out. Most of the time I found it faster to keep pressing random buttons and let luck do the work.Basically, if you LOVE puzzles, this game will keep you entertained for quite some time, otherwise stay away."
3,One of the first of a new breed,"This was one of the first adventure games to take the 1st person mouse driven detached gameplay of the Myst series and bring it into the 3d free roaming platform, and is met with mixed results..The amount of freedom for traditional adventure gamers up until this time was pretty much point to where you want to go and you will be taken there..With Mysterious Journey 2 you had the ability to apporach your investigations from any angle you like, taking your time to explore the areas in your own way..On the flipside, the advent of 3d rendering unfortunately diminishes the personality that pre rendered art has afforded adventure games throughout it's genesis..Let us hope studio's will find a way to reconcile both elements into a new and improved hybrid."
2,MEH...,"If you grew up on Myst and Riven, you will be disappointed. The graphics are ok, the music is ok, but I can deal with sucky graphics or music if the story and puzzles are worth it. Sadly, while the puzzles are somewhat tough and interesting, they are all separate and not really related to the actual story. They are just there to be there. You figure one out, you move on. Not like Riven and Myst where almost all the parts of the game connect with each other, and everything adds to or advances the main plot.Speaking of which, while the plot in Mysterious Journey has POTENTIAL to be interesting, the writing and voice overs are so corny that it falls flat.I have been searching for a game that can stand up to the Myst series ever since (sadly) UbiSoft decided not to make anymore. This one isn't it. However, if you are REALLY REALLY bored, it will amuse you for a while. Just buy it used so you don't waste your money."
1,"Horrible!!!! Bad puzzles, doesn't make sense, really uninteresting","I just don't see how anyone could like this game. The puzzles make little sense, and the game just didn't interest me at all.It starts off in an ugly, dark spaceship, and by the time I FINALLY got out of that level I was VERY ready to move on. But instead of taking me to a level with something interesting to look at and interact with (which is the ENTIRE reason I bought the game, for the beautiful backdrops), it plops me into another uninteresting level with a bunch of weird pods and laser lights.The game never gave me any clue as to what I was doing or more importantly WHY I was doing it. I had no interest in any of the EXTREMELY difficult puzzles, and I ended up just wanting to get the heck out of the game,I read one reviewer's comment (who was a mathematician), and he said some of the puzzles were even difficult for him!I will never buy any more Mysterious Journey games. They just aren't worth it."
1,DON'T BUY,Don't waste your money on this game. The puzzels are sooooooooooo difficult you need a walk through to play. I finally gave up out of frustration and uninstalled this game.
1,It's a RIPOFF!!!!!!!,"This game is a ripoff of the MYST games. From the MYSTerious to just the overall game, you're much better getting the phenomenal MYST games. Honestly, don't spend your money on something that's only a small fraction equal to the beauty of MYST, Riven, Exile (well, MYST and Riven beat Exile...), or Uru."
1,Disappointed,"After Schizm 1 I had high hopes for this game. Too bad. In my opinion, it just isn't as good. I am very disappointed.Why? The puzzles. The story. The graphics. I could go on, but I'd just be ranting and this isn't the place for it. I just didn't like it."
1,Just A Warning before you buy!!!!!,"I have not been able to play this game yet. It would have been nice to know that you need a video card that supports TnL before I bought it. Costing I found around 100.00 bucks. So now I have to wait till I can afford it. The company should have written somewhere that you need this, because I read the box, and the requirements before hand, and it said nothing about needing this video card. Now I am stuck with a game I can't play right away.....thanks alot!!"
2,1/2 Stars -,"I had a hard time getting thru this book. I kept putting it down and going back to it. It was o.k, but not really memorable.I had a hard time identifying with the characters, and did not find them to be particularly endearing. There were parts that were better than others, but overall I would skip this book.If you need something, anything to read and it is just lying there, I would read it, but it is not a book I would make a special trip to the store to get. Borrow it from someone if you really want to read it.I would read instead any book by Mariah Stewart, Susan Anderson or Marcia Evanick (hers are laugh out loud funny!)"
5,entire trilogy is great!,I loved all three books but the first was my all time favorite- then the third and second in close third but really three were amazing!
4,Good light read,I liked all three of the books in this series. They are all good light reading and still manage to inject a bit of mystery into the romance arena.
4,trilogy,I loved the series. I would recommend it to anybody.It is easy to read but you have to like romance.
3,Okay...but,The pattern is nice. I just wanted something for a high traffic area and where the the dog tends to sleep. The color tone was a little disappointing in that it was was much more muted than what appeared in the photographs.
3,"Good for undergraduates, not good enough for daily work","Herstein's book has become a classic in undergraduate teaching because it is an ""easy"" abstract algebra text that makes the student feel confident that he is really learning something advanced and important.However, when you are done with undergrad school and get really advanced this book turns out to be not so deep, not so advanced, and not so complete. I appreciate books that remained useful through several stages of my learning, and I cannot say Herstein's is one of them.One feature I don't like of this book is that it really doesn't move away from the truly basic properties of the algebraic objects it studies, I mean, it doesn't include really deep or recent results, making it a perspectiveless book. Also, some of its notations are not standard."
2,Overrated,This is a mediocre but standard introduction. Completely overrated... Confusing style and format. No real insights.
5,"If you southern and love the outdoors, you'll enjoy this","As an avid southern outdoorsman, I found this very funny and very clean. I also enjoyed the two telemarketing pranks on this album he claims to have recorded on his answering machine. They way he worked over the telemarketers was worth the price of the album as far as I am concerned. It is making me a student of how to best handle these irritating calls."
1,nothing like the movie at all!!!,"this movie was a waste of time, I read the book and watched the movie a day later and it got me so mad...nothing like it except the names of the characters...no haircut, no runnaway to alaska and the worst part none of them had red hair!!! please read the book but dont make the mistake of watching the movie"
1,Neophilia Gone Insane,"A highlighter that looks and feels like a pen. A pretty straightforward proposition. Once you've optimised it, what more can you do? The way they were designed, and made, a couple of years ago was pretty much optimal. I can't imagine how you could improve on that design. So Bic have decided that, since they must have something new and ""improved"", they would go down the route of sub-optimalisation! They made it worse. And then, in this latest incarnation of the Bic Brightliner (I refuse to spell bright, brite), they made it even worse still! The cap is now way too short, the grip is way too fat, and the tip is now much narrower than previously (produces too thin of a line).What can I say? Congratulations Bic on a truly awful new product! Was this designed in Guangxhou province by a Chinese ex-chicken farmer?"
2,Brite and wet,"I got the BIC Z4 Brite Liner as a bonus when I bought a package of BIC's regular brite liner. I primarily use highlighters in my textbooks. This highlighter sure does what the name intends-it sure is bright! I like highlighters that are bright and don't look faded . However, I found it to be too wet. It would not dry right away and would smudge on the page. The highlighted area would crinkle a bit because it was so wet and I could see it on the back of the page as well. I don't think I would buy this highlighter again. It's too messy and I don't like having to wait until the page is dry before I can turn it over."
4,The best Bible highlighter!,"I bought and tested A LOT of highlighters out in the market and found the Bic Z4 to be the current best for highlighting thin pages. But there are room for LOTS of improvements!Positives:- Will not bleed through to the back page on really thin Bible paper!!!- Bright colors compared to ""Bible highlighters"" found in Christian bookstores.Negatives:- The supply will run out quickly because...- of its wet consistency.- expensive!I hope a competitor will make a comparable or superior product."
3,"Fair, Not Very Good","Book was advertised as hardback in very good condition. Binding is broken from pages, however pages are intact. Paper is severely yellowed. Would rate condition fair, not very good."
1,Better Off Forgotten,"it is obvious given the amount of negative votes here that i will receive my share for this negative review. I have purchased all six of Tamara's books and she has a record with me of 4 wins and 2 losses. The Haunted, and Moonfall were extremely good books and I also enjoyed Eternity and Bad Things. Her latest offering, The Forgotten, is one of the most boring and uninspired novels I have read in some time. I really hate to say that but I have to. Please do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else. I won't even loan this book to any of my friends. It is that bad."
1,"Less Sex and Perversion, More Horror, Please","I've read all of Tamara Thorne's books, and have to say that her endless obssession with sex and perversion gets really boring after awhile. If I wanted to read about wild sexual antics, I'd pick up some good erotica, not a supposed horror novel. A little bit in moderation is fine, but with her books, it seems like on every other page you're reading about someone's sexual fantasies, escapades, or perversions (including rape) - INSTEAD of getting a few good scares.This book isn't really a horror novel - it's a novel about mind control through cable boxes. And when it ends abruptly, leaving a number of loose ends hanging and much unexplained, it doesn't provide much satisfaction to the reader.""The Forgotten"" was a disappointment."
4,"Excellent, fast-paced novel","I picked this up at the library and couldn't put it down. I thought it was a very interesting concept, and the characters drew me in pretty quickly. The lead role, Will Banning, is a psychologist in a small town where odd things start happening. Of course, he is skeptical of the supernatural and believes a normal, rational reason is behind it. I won't ruin it for anyone by going further. While this isn't a blood-soaked gorefest (which I also enjoy) there was plenty of suspense and action. I would recommend this book to anyone.Ryan K HooverAuthor of ""Immortal Implements"""
1,ATROCIOUS writing,This woman can't even remember what she wrote two pages earlier!! The editor should be fired for allowing such glaring errors and inconsistencies.Never again.
3,Hallucination or real?,"A flock of crows commits mass suicide...Fish are literally jumping from the ocean...Domestic animals become terrified...and people are seeing ghosts. Are people loosing their minds in the sleepy California town or have their minds finally become open to what has always been there, but never before seen?A good fast read. My only complaints are that the characters are a little superficial and predictable and the ending was rushed. I will, however, be seeking out Ms. Thorne's other books. This book will have you asking yourself questions about what is real in this world, and what is not."
2,Interesting concept,"I enjoyed the concept uf this book. The ending was a bit anti climactic, the whole thing wraps up in about 4 pages, with several loose ends that are unaswered. The biggest drawback is that I felt I was having the gay agenda shoved down my throat since appx half the cast was gay. If you can ignore that, take a look."
4,CD'S,Alter Bridge... awesome depth of melody/feelings/lyrics/guitar... and Myles Kennedy's fabulous voice!! (Other 2 are great too)!Ottmar Leibert... love it.Propaganda... 1234 = good blast from the past. Didn't like the other one.
3,Propaganda-1234 Review,I was pleased with the Amazon experience. Had no problems and the cd came to me in great shape and before they said it would.The cd itself was not one of Propaganda's best - but it had a few really good tunes.
2,Propaganda Watered Down The Mojo On The Second Album,"Extremely sad 2nd Propaganda album was a bitter disappointment. Losing Ralf Dorper and Claudia Brucken dealt a fatal blow to the band. Gaining the classic Simple Minds rhythm section of Brian Mcgee and Derek ""god of bass' Forbes made not a whit of difference! [shocking!!!] and new vocalist Betsi Miller is just in the wrong band. Only ""Your Wildlife"" and ""Ministry Of Fear"" make the attempt. Elsewhere songs are co-written with Howard Jones.... HOWARD JONES!!!!"
1,NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THEIR DEBUT,"I don't know why they tried to follow up to a masterpiece (A SECRET WISH) with only 1 original member of the band and still call themselves Propaganda. The ONLY track worth while that actually sounds like a track that could have been included on A SECRET WISH is Ministry of Fear, which contains vocals from original member Suzanne Freytag.I had the great fortune of meeting Propaganda at a gig they did at the now defunct nightclub ""Heartbeat"" on Long Island, New York. This is going back many many moons ago when A SECRET WISH was first released in the US.I (still) hope that the original members of Propaganda will jump on the 80's Bands Reunion Bus when it drives through their town.Wishful thinking I guess..."
2,It's NOT Wishful Thinking,"Michael Mertens is the only original member of Propaganda on this album, and it's pretty obvious at once. Not recommeded for those looking for a continuation of their early 80's sound - it's at least listenable, but obviously aimed for radio airplay, and so a bit on the bland side."
5,Music ahead of its time....,"I had this album at the beginning of the decade. It was ""borrowed"" and lost. I bought it again this month. Yes, I still love it. The melodies are haunting. The slick productions are very 1989/90; as are the electronic instruments. But the words and music are killers! The breathy/juvenile female voice the key to the album. The best of the decade! Ian Stanley & Chris Hughes, (the producers), had a sound here that appeared later many times in other music groups. But Propaganda had it all. I have since started a search to find more music from the same individuals. Talent always surfaces. Big talent in this album."
3,Packaged for easy use,"Bought this because of good reviews. My cuticles are always dry, so carrying this in my purse to use throughout the day seemed like a good idea. The oil did help. Only drawback is I can't find it locally and shipping charges are expensive. I plan to find a comparable product that does not require shipping."
5,Great,"I must say I haven't used these much yet, but find them to be wonderful so far. I only wish they had come as a part of my kitchen set."
4,Completing the knife set.,We bought these kitchen scissors to complete the OXO knife set. These scissors are good qaulity and well packaged.
1,Dangerous and cheap as they rust and break!!!,"I had these scissors for just under two years (received them as a wedding gift in June 2005). The started to rust in under a year, and then the handles started slipping. Eventually the plastic on the handles cracked, while I was cutting some chives. The process of the plastic cracking pinched and cut my skin. I actually kept the scissors around for another few weeks as the ""scissor part"" still worked, but then the other handle cracked and the plastic fell off. My grandmother has had the same kitchen scissors for nearly 50 years..."
5,Must have these for your kitchen.,I read reviews of these before I purchased. I have been very pleased. They can snip a chicken into pieces in no time flat! They have impressed me just like my other OXO utensils.
4,Nice!,"Sharp, sharp, sharp! I like these scissors. They work well and are easy to clean. My only complaint is the handle is a bit large for my small hands but this is knit picking. I'm left handed and they work well for me."
2,Not impresssed,"We own a lot of OXO items due to their quality, but I was disappointed in these scissors. We used them all the time and then they started to wear and lose sharpness. They have also shown signs of rusting, which surprised me. We have only had them for about 6 mos and now they struggle to cut a plastic bag. Not sure if we got a defective pair, but I am usually an OXO loyal. I had a pair of farberware scissors that lasted years.I still gave them two stars due to the design for easy cleaning. The grips are also comfortable."
4,Good scissors.,"I really like the cutting action, they feel sturdy, I like that they come apart to clean. I don't like the rubber handles. When you cut something your hand actually needs to slide a little in the handle but the rubber is too ""grippy"" and rubs your hand. I would have preferred a smoother plastic handle. The herb strippers work so so at best. If you don't mind the grippy rubber handles, buy them.Update: I have been using theses scissors for over two years now and my opinion now is much better than when I first got them. I am upgrading the rating from 3 to 4 stars. I very rarely use the herb strippers."
4,These are great value scissors,"What I like the most about these are you can separate them and drop them in the dishwasher for cleaning. The scissors I bought couple of years ago are working just great and does not seem to have lost much sharpness. We use it to cut scissors and even meat, like salads etc."
4,finally!,"We're enjoying our kitchen scissors. Being able to take them apart to clean them has helped us keep rust from developing on the joining part. I must add, they are immensely comfortable to use. They could be a bit sharper, but if something every happened to these, we'd buy another pair exactly like them. For the price, they really are a great value."
2,Putco 401201,The covers have very little adhesive! No Instructions! After Driving forLong periods the covers start to come loose! They do look good when Installed.
2,Check it out at the library like I did,"I couldn't identify with the main character, Rosie. The author only described superficial details about her, and gave no insight into the death of her infant daughter, so to me, it really seemed like she was being ridiculous and hypervigilant about her son. I couldn't get upset over the way she was treated, because I agreed with everyone else that she was suspicious. Then there was that predictable ending. This book exemplifies why I usually don't like ""who done it"" stories. The author tries to throw you off track and drag things out until the end, only within the last few pages to find a quick and implausible ending. I saw no real reason for the ""bad guy/girl"" to do what he/she did, but I knew all along it was him/her. In books like this, the bad person is always the one who seems too much like the good person. If you like this sort of thing, go for it. I didn't enjoy it much."
2,Rather boring,"I didn't like this book at all. I thought it was boring. I think I'm supposed to feel sorry for the woman but I don't. I only felt put off by the details of her thoughts and emotions, and just forced myself to finish the whole thing. The ending was also predictable."
3,Enjoyable Game :),"I really enjoyed this game from start to finish. The graphics are stunning and the puzzles were well made and appropriate to the game. Some were on the easy side for an experienced gamer, but this would be a fabulous introduction for a newbie. My kids like to sit on my bed with me and watch the games as I play, and this is a perfect choice for that - they asked questions about Egypt, asked about the point of what we were doing, and offered ideas for how to get it done. I recommend it and would rate it higher if I hadn't played games that were longer (and to me longer is better)."
1,unfriendly to xp,"I could not get this title to run on my computer. It is equipped with XP and the game gave a fatal error after all 3 attempts at loading. Could have been just a bad disc so I don't actually know if it's a programming problem. None the less, I could not play the game."
5,Worth it for the Land of ISIS!! (Breathtakingly Beautiful!),"O.K. I am too dumb to play without a copy of the walkthrough...so I saved a bit of time there. I had been impressed by a ""night scene"" in Egypt 2, but when I made it to the ""Night Scene"" in the Kingdom of ISIS...I was actually blown away by the breathtaking BEAUTY ....I actually closed the game just so I could revisit that Beautiful Island for about 3 days and whenever I has a minute I just ""sat"" there and looked up at the sky!The graphics are MUCH better than Egypt 2, and the characters much less cartoonish. The story line is O.K.the puzzles not too hard....I sometimes asked myself ""Is this the kind of thing that other adults are REALLY spending time on??""....but then I find I just HAVE to do a detour to sit by the pool at the Temple, or admire the Land of Isis, and I think ""WOW!""...how do they PUT all this Dream stuff onto a little bitty disc?"
2,Boring,Just couldn't get into this game. It was boring. I only played for a little while and it just didn't hold my interest.I had just finished playing Syberia before this one so maybe that had something to do with it.
1,Modem Almost Works Right,"A big thumbs down!!Installed seamlessly and seemed to work OK untill I tried to send a fax to a real fax machine. It will not connect. Conclude that it is modem problem and not the fault of the remote fax machines since I have two other computers (an HP and a ""brand X"") both of which comunicate with the fax machines.Have tried both the default Windows XP and the latest USR drivers with same results.So far USR unhelpful."
1,Pathetic modem,This sorry modem has never connected above 16k and gives me a 3comlink.exe fail error whenever I disconnect. I'll take the rebate when it comes but this piece of junk is already in the circular file. Avoid USR products.
1,Doesn't connect as fast as it should,"After 8 phone calls to US Robotics customer service, they can't get my modem to connect any quicker than 21K, even though I have a laptop that can connect at 44K using the same line. The guy finally said that I just won't be able to connect as quickly using this modem (sucky product). They were able to tell me how to disable V.92, at which point I'm up to 31K. But that's the best I can get this modem to go.I found out on my support call that I was using the wrong driver, but the documentation that came with the modem did not explain how to install the driver. I extected more from a name brand."
1,This modem [is] absolutely [horrible]!!,"I got this modem after my USR Sportster got fried by lightning. All I can say about it is that since I installed it, it has actually connected to my ISP maybe 4 out of who knows how many times. I've tried everything I could think of to make it work like a good little modem should, but no cigar. I miss my Sportster. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!![January 6, 2005 Amendment Below (I forgot I purchased this modem B4)]I bought this modem because my old modem got fried a few weeks ago. Ever since it was installed, it has been a pain. Most of the time, it disconnects when I'm in the middle of downloading a relatively large file, and sometimes, it disconnects right after I connect.I've been in contact with U.S Robotics via email trying to solve this problem to no avail.I suppose USR has decided that they have so much money that their customers don't matter. Corporations...gotta love 'em.USR has lost my trust."
1,Not Good,"After purchassing 4 USR 56K model 2#5699B &2 5699A all four fail in connecting, shutting down my phone lines, in a year, ... I chose these Modems because of the BVRP tool wich is easy to send fax. I would not recomend buying the Robotic Modems ..."
1,Good for wasting time,"The modem installation went smooth as silk, then I actually tried to get online with my Windows XP machine. After about a dozen or so 678 connection errors with various reinstalls, init strings and other assorted troubleshooting techniques, I gave up and put it into my Windows 98 machine. I thought it might do the same thing, but it actually didn't. I got about a dozen or so 720 connection errors.I returned it an purchased a generic pci modem for a lower price. It connected on the first try at 48k. No problems since."
4,US Robotics V.90-V.92 Internal PCI Faxmodem,"they worked great when i needed them ,but i had to upgrade to satellite internet do to our dial up provider couldn't fix there problems."
1,"A discontinued product, Uncompatible with Windows 7",There was no notice that this was a discontinued product in the review and that it was not compatible with Windows 7. Spent about an hour installing it and then having to remove it. A waste of time that could have been avoided with a little information on it.
1,"Bought 2, Both Defective","I bought 2 of these; both were defective. The Amazon 30 day return/credit process worked great! Both units started 'popping & crackling' when trying to connect, failing to connect. Sometimes, the units would work for a few hours or a day, after I let it sit unused for hours, but the failure kept on occurring. I contacted USRobotics tech support; they said the first was defective; they said the second was not defective, and that the problem was (1) a defect in my PCI slot; (2) a defect in motherboard. I replaced the second unit with a Trendnet TFM-PCIV92A, and it has worked without a failure for sevveral days. Apparently, the PCI slot & motherboard is not a problem with this Trendnet unit."
1,No Windows 7 or Vista drivers,"Windows 7 users beware! I bought this product was listed on Microsoft's site as being Windows 7 compatible. However, neither Windows Update nor the USRobotics site have drivers for it. Worse, Windows Vista drivers don't appear to be available. Not sure who the target users are, but I'm not one of them."
1,XP Users Beware,"I was recommended this modem by Dell (and THANK YOU very much) and it has been a nightmare. I've done searches on the error message that I CONSTANTLY receive and have found that many other users are having the same problem! And the problem has been known for more than a year (so why DID Dell recommend?!?)I did a lot of reading and it seems that 'there is a compatibility issue between USRobotics5699B and Windows XP Service Pack 2'. Sure sounds right to me, I have a VERY hard time staying connected to the internet: as in, hardware failures many times in a row and many times a day and, apparently, all to do with this modem.I have tried SO many 'fixes' in the last 2 months and NOTHING has worked: I am now giving up and trying a different modem. Good Luck To Me. :^PSo, if you run WindowsXP Service Pack 2 I would really try a different modem!!!"
1,The box looks pretty,"I thought I would say something good about this fine product before I let out my true feelings: The box it comes in looks pretty.With that said, this modem is the biggest piece of junk I have ever used. I purchased this product on brand name alone. I thought US Robotics would put out a quality product. I was wrong.The modem refused to connect to my ISP at over 28.8 Kbps. When I could get it to connect, it would stop responding within minutes. The drivers also caused Windows XP to crash hard a good number of times while using.I used this modem for 3 days. I then bought a cheapo generic modem for $10 that works 100% better."
1,Big Disappointment,Lightning wiped out my modem this morning. Picked this up in town because of the name. Slow to connect. Keeps dropping the connection. New driver from U.S. Robotics site doesn't help. Nice box.
1,Horrible Soft Modem -- Dont use w/98SE,"This is a horrible little soft modem, that freezes the computer upon disconnecting from the ISP under W/98. Didn't bother to call tech support, returned modem ASAP for refund. Don't bother, go with ZOOM instead."
4,Its good Modem But so sensitive with electrical shock,This is a good modem even on the worse telephone line the modem still performs well. Easy to install just plug in to the PCI slot and the rest its your Desktop responsible to setting the driver & find the empty COM for your PCI internal modem. But this product its to sensitive with electrical shock. Its better when you not using your modem just plug out you modem from the telephone line.
5,Fabulous! Back to his old form!,"The song ""An Eye for an Eye"" written by Bush is worth the cost of the album. Bush is the greatest. I think he would be bigger than Wllie Nelson if he hadn't developed spasm dystonia in the middle of his career. Here he is backto his old form, you hear the great country caruso again!"
1,not even worth the $4 deal I got it for,"The nature shots are subpar--nothing special AT ALL. And the animations??? What animations?! They are VERY few and far in between and even more subpar than the actual nature pictures. I own planet earth, life, and countless national geographic nature shows, and this dvd doesn't even come close to comparing on ANY level. If you want to know if it's worth the price...well, I'm a nature show enthusiast who paid $4 for it and I'm PISSED."
5,Absolutely superb!,"Both sound and video are great examples of what can be acheived by blu-ray high definition.For my family, this film is one we'll watch over and over again to appreciate the magnificence of nature captured by masters of the photographic art.Highly recommended and a must for your blu-ray collection."
5,Es Que La Naturaleza Es Bella!,"If you're into tranquil scenery and beautiful surroundings I strongly recommend getting this title. HD DVD transfer is superb...for after all, life is in the details."
2,Outdated lessons on golf,"This video is quite disappointing in both instruction and production quality. Geiberger's classic swing appears as outdated as his stretch polyester pants. Complicating matters is his partner/mentor, Jim Blakely. The meaningless chatter from this old fossil makes this video a great candidate for the bargain bin.I'd recommend buying the Al Geiberger's sybervision video and leave this stinking fish alone."
3,Smart design,This is such a good design to store jewelry. All my 60-something pairs of ear rings are all now in one place!
5,Great hanging jewelry organizer,"This organizer is a great help to me. I can see my jewelry now. It has so many pockets I actually used one side for my jewelry and the other side for my collection of keyrings and souvenir pins! It comes with a nice sturdy hanger. I hung it on the back of my bedroom door, which works well for me. The only challenge I had placing the jewelry in it was that it is so big I had to hang it to place items in the top pockets after filling the bottom pockets!I purchased one for me and one for my sister; we both love them. It keeps little fingers out of our jewelry, while letting us see what we have!"
3,"Almost, but not quite","My mom has a couple of hanging jewelry organizers and I thought it was a brilliant idea. What I really needed was something to allow me to organize and show my necklaces. This doesn't quite do it - great for earrings, small bracelets, etc but not that good for the number of bigger, chunky necklaces that I have. And, if something that isn't tiny is in one pocket, the pocket on the opposite side of the organizer is already at a smaller capacity. Hoping this loosens up a little with time and use. Unfortunately one of the products that I should have looked around and tried to examine and purchase in person instead of over the internet. Will go ahead and make it work because with the shipping it's not worth returning."
4,Great organizer.,This is a wonderful organizer. The size of the product is a bit too big and there are not many pockets big enough to fit bigger necklaces and bracelets. But overall a good product.
5,Great organizer,"This helped me keep all of my jewelry organized. I used to forget to wear certain jewelry because I never saw what I had, since I had a jewelry box. However, this canvas organizer allows me to see all of my jewelry and now I wear all of my stuff."
4,Jewelry organizer,This is a good product. I recommend it to anyone. The vendor shipped it in a very timely manner.
3,Jewelry Storage,Cannot properly review as the item is a Christmas gift that hasn't been given yet as Christmas is still 6 days away. Will do a review after it is given and feedback is provided to me by the receiver of the item....
4,Like it but pockets are very tight.,"I like this product and it holds most of my jewelry, but the pockets are very tight and it is really difficult to get some of my bigger necklaces in the large pockets.. Also many of my stud style earrings are impossible to get into any of the pockets. It also hangs crooked."
5,Nice organizer,"Nice quality, easy to see and use. Nice size of pockets for necklaces, earrings, watches, bracelets. Glad I got the canvas model."
4,Great Idea,"This is a great idea for storing jewelry. I don't think this was really designed for bulky costume jewelry, but works great for smaller necklaces, bracelets, rings, anklets and some earrings (not studs)."
4,Love this!!!,I LOVE this product! I can see all my jewelry without going through several jewelry boxes. I love it and I'm wearing more of a variety of jewelry now that I can find it!
4,More jewelry please,"If you are someone who loves jewelry...this is a great option for viewing all your different pieces of jewelry at once. One thing is it's not very ""cute"" or pleasing to the eye - but bottom line is it's functional and it's two-sided!"
5,"Finally, I can see what I've got--","This jewelry organizer is great! No more fumbling through little drawers or white boxes trying to find the one thing I want--I hung this at the end of my closet, and I can see exactly what I want/need when I get dressed in the morning. And in taking everything out of the little drawers/boxes, I also found several pieces I had forgotten I had--worth every penny!"
3,"Great concept, not very practical..","I was really excited to get this product in the mail & use it on my trip overseas because I knew it would be a lifesaver. Unfortunately I won't be bringing it overseas because I can't even fit half my jewelry in it! This is great if you wear REALLY small earrings, necklaces, & bracelets..although the pockets do not fasten & secure your jewelry inside, so don't put anything expensive in there. My jewelry tends to be a little chunkier & there is no stretch to the pockets, even to fit a set of 3 small bracelets! Plus, the jewelry sticks out of the top. The pockets towards the bottom are larger, but still not large enough to secure your jewelry safely. Good luck getting anything in the other pockets! I had trouble getting small pins & brooches in those too!"
2,Great concept but the pockets are too small,"I have a cheaper one I like much better that I bought years ago at Odd Job. This one is sturdy and has more pockets but they are very small and tight so it's hard to fit anything in them larger than a pin. Even bracelets have to be crammed in and a bulky necklace just would not fit. The few larger pockets are at the bottom - too low down to reach conveniently and not really that large. It might work for nails, screws, paper clips etc. - small stuff that you could easily see and get at."
4,Jewelry Organizer very helpful.,I really like the Whitney Design 80-Pocket Cotton Canvas Jewelry Organizer. It very helpful in organizing your jewelry. You can hang it in your closet and pick out your jewelry as you pick out your clothes for the day. The organizer is very good for earrings and bracelets. Your bigger necklaces however will not fit.
5,Came back for more,"I love these canvas jewelry organizers. Easy to see, easy to find and easy to store. They keep everything clean and together. I love the hanger because I can keep them right there with my clothes so I can see if they match right away."
5,perfect for jewelry storage,"As a rep for Stella & Dot, I needed something to store my jewelry where I could still see it all. This works perfect!! It holds rings, earrings, bracelets very well. There are different size pockets too. When I head to a trunk show I just hang it in my car on the garment hook and it travels well!Rebecca C.Stella & Dot, Independent Stylist[...]"
5,Just what I wanted,This is just what I wanted. It is a way to organize pieces so that it doesn't take a lot of space and still you can see what you have and find it easily. Some larger pieces will not fit in the pockets but most pieces are not that large so it works well for me.
4,makes accessorizing a breeze,I replaced a bunch of small jewelry boxes for this organizer and it worked out great because when I am getting dressed I can quickly look a at all my jewelry and see exactly what goes best with my outfit.....very efficient. One thing that you have to watch out for is the pockets remain open so if you flip the organizer the jewelry will fall out. Overall I am very happy because my jewelry is organized and accesible.
4,Good Name Badge Holder,"I use this item as a name-tag holder for my church preschool dept. It is a very useful tool to hold up to 80 name tags. I'm sure that is not the design intent, but it works great. It is portable, hangable, and allows us to see the photo ID badge inside. I've now purchased 4 altogether for our different classrooms."
3,to small and to tight,I thought this product will help me organize all my accessories but the pockets are to small and to tight.
2,Does not do what I wanted,I am not happy with this as the pockets are too tight to really insert anything into them except the skinniest of whatever. wanted it to keep my earrings organized but cannot squeeze them into to the pockets.
1,Not very impressed,"I really didn't like this item because the pockets were very, very small and it was difficult to get jewelry in and out."
4,Exactly what I needed,"My jewelry was a jumble, in boxes all over my dresser, and in drawers of a jewelry box. This thing allowed me to organize it all in the clear pouches and hang it in front of my closet. It would be perfect if some pouches were larger than others (to fit chunkier, longer necklaces)."
5,Love This Jewelry Organizer,This is a great jewelry organizer. It is made really well. The hanger is a heavy metal and a nice canvas material with heavy gauge plastic for pockets. Now I can see every piece of jewelry without digging in a jewelry box. Doesn't take up any space in the closet or hang on a door. Great product for the money.
5,Well made-does what it says,I bought two-very pleased. Canvas backing is made well; seams are heavy duty; hanger is thicker than a wire hanger; plastic organizers are secure. Well worth the money and all my jewelry is readily viewable and organized.
5,Sooo Handy,"This is a terrific item. Buy two! I filled my first one up in no time and decided to order another - not that I have all that much jewelry, but by the time I sorted things out - earrings, bracelets, necklaces, etc. - I was out of space. I wish I had purchased a couple of these years ago. Finally I can tell where my stuff is. The see-through pockets make finding the right pair of earrings a snap."
4,Really like the jewelry organizer!,"Very pleased with this item!!! I bought 1 for each of my daughters and they really like them. No more digging through a jewelry box, everything is right there in plain view. It seems as if they were always losing 1 earring because they would lay them on their dresser and 1 would inevitably get knocked off and ""disappear"". But with this jewelry organizer, they take their earrings off and put them in the pocket! Problem solved!!! It works well with their bracelets and most necklaces too. The only downside that I've seen is the fact that to see what's on the other side, you have to turn the whole thing around. A swivel hanger would have been more feasible. Besides that, we are really pleased!!! Great to give for teenagers and older women as well!!!"
3,Jewelry Organizer,"This does an adequate job of holding most of my jewelry. The problem is, the pockets are very tight. If you have chunky or stiff jewelry pieces, you will never get them into the pockets without ripping them. If you plan on using this for traveling, don't. It will never work. The pockets will never stay closed when you try to roll it. It is nice to hang in the closet with your clothes. Makes it very easy to coordinate your jewelry with your outfits. I used the extra pockets for hair accessories. The larger jewelry pieces I hung over the hanger. It works okay for the price."
4,Great Product!!! Organized all my jewelry in one package.,I love this item. I can easily take it anywhere. It has made my life simple and organized.
2,More Larger Pockets Needed - Can't Use Both Sides,"This is a fantastic idea. Obviously great for jewelry. But not enough larger pockets. And once you put something on one side you cannot fill the pocket on the corresponding opposite side, unless you put a piece of paper in the pocket.Looking for some significant improvements on a fantastic idea. Yes it has helped me to be much more organized and now I can find things and my husband is pretty impressed. Since he thinks he is the king of neat and organized."
3,Why No Zippers?,"This would be a better product if it had zippers. With zippered compartments you could fold it in thirds and put it in a suitcase for travel. Or if you accidentally dropped it someday, you wouldn't have to worry about anything falling out. As it is, it is a decent organizer, but your jewelry isn't as secure because of the lack of zippers. Also, an anti-tarnish lining would prevent sterling from tarnishing during storage."
3,What did you expect with Arch Hall Jr.???,"Looking at some of the poor reviews here I just gotta shake my head. What exactly were these people expecting from ""Nasty Rabbit""? It stars Arch Hall Jr.!! You should have known going into this thing that it would most likely resemble ""The Choppers"" more than it would ""Citizen Kane"". If I were to criticize ""Nasty Rabbit"" for anything, it would be that Arch Hall Jr. is only on screen for about 15-20 minutes of the total movie. ""Nasty Rabbit"" is probably Arch Hall Jr's worst film, and that is saying something, but it was still enjoyable, in that ""so bad it's good"" kind of way."
2,Pointless,"This ""comedy"" is all about a rabbit with a disease on the loose,with all manner of strange characters after it.More weird than funny,this is for b-movie freaks and very strange people only.Richard Kiel,later Jaws in James Bond,makes an appearance,but looks very confused.Who can blame him?"
1,It ripped almost immediately,"This bag looked great out of the box, but it is really flimsy and the fabric ripped around the hanging holes almost immediately. I would not recommend it."
3,Good price value. Hanging Canvas Suit Bag,"Amazon.com is excellent with the free Supersave delivery option.I received the product sooner then expected and the all products inside the box were there in good condition.The product itself is very good except for the wiring inside, it would've been better with a stronger wire frame. But it does the job nicely (especially for the price I paid)At $20 I recommend it."
2,Poorly edited out of date,They just keep adding to this book without removing or editing old material. The book has become a chaotic jumble of ideas of the various authors. There are other better books out there.
2,Useless,"Ok, so i am a chemical engineering student, and this is supposed to be the textbook. Which allegedly would later on make it a forced reference for a student. However, the only useful information is the steam tables, because the properties and other things are insufficient, trust me, the book has sitted on my shelf unused for a year and a half. I have not sold it because no one here would buy it. The explanations are poor. If you want to know about thermodynamics, this is really not your book, I would rather recommend a Fisicochemistry book.As for properties tables and the such, well, the information you are really going to use is all summed up in the Chemical Engineer's Handbook, which is a must for any ChE, even if you're just a student (believe me, it has saved me a lot of times)."
3,A good intro to thermo,"This is a good starter book for an intro course in Thermo for Chemical Engineers. Aside from being and extremely boring book to both read and look at, the material is presented well. Heat and Refrigeration cycles are somewhat shallow in detail. The examples throughout the book are not that great, either, but they get the job done. I don't think it is worth the ...price tag (Hint: buy a used one). I kept mine because it has some useful information (i.e., steam tables, critial properties, etc.)"
4,"Boring, but well presented","Don't expect pretty colors and drawings that catch you're eye from this book. But then again, if you're going to be a chemical engineer, get used to it. The material is presented quite well, at times a bit dense and bland, but reading this book thoroughly will give you a good grasp on thermodynamics. This one will be on the shelf in my office some day."
2,All good except front mount doesnt fit,"After finally installing my engine i noticed all 3 mounts, back and both side mounts, worked perfect. The front mount: doesnt even come close to fitting. Im going to machine a solid chunk of delrin to make the front work. I kept the old one just in case but ill never need it. I wouldnt recommend this product unless your SURE they include the proper front mount. Im dissapointed"
2,"Laughable, but a great BAD MOVIE","Plan Nine From Outer Space, move over! The worst movie EVER MADE (in this writer's opinion, anyway) is MANOS, THE HANDS OF FATE.In this laughably bad film, an innocent family is captured by the wierd occult ""high priest"" Manos (Spanish for ""Hands"", get it?) and turned into his strange slaves for weird rituals that are so badly filmed they make no sense.""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" did a great spoof of this film, but if you really want to torture yourself (or die laughing???) buy the original and be treated to cheap sets, poor cinematography, bad music, and even worse acting. And, oh, yes, Torgo. We can't forget Torgo the Handyman and his haunting ""theme"".This movie is so bad that it is good!"
1,As low as you can go.,This is absolutely the worst movie ever made. This has more errors on it than one of my rough drafts. And it's not like the movie is so bad that it's funny. It's more like the feeling of being trapped in a cellar for about a few hours. Thank god the MST3K version makes it more bearable.
4,Worst Movie Ever Made!,"First off, I was very high when I decided to buy this movie. I will not do this ever again. After hearing how terrible this movie was I had to buy it. Manos used to be the #1 worst movie ever made according to IMDB however I think it is not one of the top ten. Buy this movie and watch it just so you can appreciate how bad movies made today are indeed not that bad when compared to this steaming pile of wtf am I watching. Side note, get high before watching this movie, just don't take acid or mushrooms and decide to watch it, it will make you uncomfortable and even more confused than normal."
1,Worst chunk of film trash ever.,"This movie was made on a bet, no joke. It really was the product of a bet. It was shot with rented equipment (without sound) and the cast had no experience at all. It pops up on Horror Host shows like Elvira's and that's where it should stay. If you're really serious about wasting an hour and a half of your life then buy the MST3K version instead because they at least make it a bit funny (which takes away some of the pain and suffering of seeing Mangos: The Cans Of Fruit). Sorry, I meant Manos: The Hands Of Fate."
1,Some REAL Manos history,"This is not so much a ""review"" (we all know this is the -debatably- worst film ever made) as a quick note to clear up some urban legend myths concerning some of the Manos cast which are perpetuated in two of the first reviews of the film here on Amazon.1. Only ONE cast member ever committed suicide. ONE. Not two, not five. ONE. John Reynolds, who played Torgo.2. Reynolds did NOT commit suicide because of anything having to do with the film. He had allegedly been into drug use and LSD experimentation, and combined with an alleged abusive military father, John one day simply cracked.End of story.The film is so bad it doesn't need crude after-the-act embellishment!Oh yes .... how would I know all this? My father was one of the cast members."
1,"If you MUST watch this movie, bring a bucket to puke in.","Good god this movie sucked! The plot is horrible. The acting was so cheap 2 year olds could do better.This is not worth 6 dollars. The only part I thought was funny was a b***h fight scene were manos's wives beat each other up for no dumb reason!And get a load out of this, it goes on for practically half the movie! And even the fighting was cheesey!- What the HELL is a sampo?!?!?- manos means hands in spanish, so the movie title really is ""Hands, the hands of fate"" WHAT THE HECK?!- torgo the goat man.(note that hes not actually a goat, he accent sounds like one and he limps like one too)- the annoying child+ if you did suffer brain cell loss from whatching this, good news, redeem those brain cells with comedy by whatching the mystery science theater 3000 version were they make fun of it!overall do not buy, save the six dollars and use them to by the mst3k version."
1,don't buy manos!,"i am a b-movie aficianado and i love campy movies, but this is unwatchable. the novelty wears off within 5 minutes and then you're stuck with one of the worst movies ever made. knowing this was quentin tarantino's favorite ""comedy"" was what swayed me to get it, but he was probably being overly nostalgic about this movie. the cover art is the funniest part. i recommend generous fast-forwarding or just buying the MST 3000 version."
5,Good Quality Paper,"Purchased for my 5 yr old grand daughter, she uses it with colored pencils and markers. She loves it! She loves the whole booklet idea, she also has the watercolor pad."
5,Mind blowing!,"This video is a maddening classic. Johnny Legend and his barrage of crazy cohorts (Chief Leatherlips, who wears a really cheap-looking mask and Swami Slash) are worth the price alone with Legends insane commentary. The action is great too, especially the ""Concession Stand Stomp"". Ive seen the half hour special edition and plan on buying the full lenth version, I'm sure I won't be disapointed. If you like 80's wrestling this video is crucial to your collection."
4,12 Exitos (Hits) Broadway Meets Love-Hate,"If you like musicals, are in a relationship and have ever experienced the relational joy of battling and making up, you'll enjoy this. The Brother and Sister duo of Joaquin and Lucia Galtan's ""Pimpinela 12 Exitos"" features a compilation of spanish ""Broadway Style"" love-hate songs. The album beautifully depicts the paradox of relationships with songs like ""Te Digo Blanco, Me Dices Negro"" (I say white, you say black) and ""Vivir Sin Ti No Puedo"" (Can't Live Without You). If you understand spanish, lyrically, 12 Exitos is poetically-sensational. Vocally, Lucia and Joaquin Galtan get the mood across for those unfamiliar with the language of Cervantes. Definately worth getting."
1,A Frustrating Game,"This is a very frustrating game. I have a good computer system and have never had the difficulties I encountered playing this game, i.e., very ""jerky"" maneuvering movements; highly sensitive Navigation Cursor in that you go to another area without wanting to and have to return; ""Saved Games"" not loading at times; having to reboot due to freezing or blacking out of the scene.This could be a fun game as the concept and some of the characters are good, particularly the lizards but the frustration is not worth it."
1,Made Me Sick...,"Well I didn't like this game at all. The fact that it was strange didn't really bother me. It was the horrible gameplay. It was one of those games where the camara went along with where you dragged your mouse, and you had to look all around you. up, down, left, right. It made me absolutely nauseous. After about 2 minutes of playing I felt like I had to throw up. Not to mention that the story is horrible, it's not funny. It's just plain cheezy. If anyone finds this game funny they have a very strange sense of humor. Every character in the game was really annoying. You couldn't actually talk to them. When you clicked on them, they would say things to you, but it isn't interactive conversation. Wow was this one bad. I just felt there was no point to the story, and I wanted all of the characters to be quiet."
2,Buggy,"I've been trying for a week to get this to work. I've been going back and forth with their support department and the game keeps locking up my machine. From what I've seen of the game so far, it looks like you might want to stay away from this."
3,Pleasantly surprised,"I looked at some of the reviews and they were all over the place. Some people loved it and some hated it. What surprised me was the humor. Maybe it's just me but I was delighted with the humor which was so nice for a change. I particularly liked how everything was taken so lightly and there was never any sense of threat or fear or negative emotions that seem to be such a big part of games. Even when Jack falls hundreds of feet from a cliff he is laughing by the time he gets near the bottom. That broke me up. I wouldn't say this was my favorite game, but it was such a treat to have some fun and play a game that was truly entertaining."
4,Cult thing,"I really enjoyed this game from the beginning. It is one of those cult things like Being John Malcovitch where you find this one for yourself. I don't think it is a mainstream game like some of the big ones from the past. But I really, really liked the fresh approach here. If your favorite movies and games are ones that have a different approach then here you go. I loved it."
2,very disappointed,"I had a lot of trouble playing this game. Each time after playing for 30 minutes or so, the game would freeze, I would have to restart my computer, and thus lost the play. This was extremely frustrating. But this was not the only glitch. Sometimes the view spun out of control, so I couldn't complete the puzzles and had to restart. Lots of problems there. But apart from that, although the scenes were lovely, the story lacked continuity, the puzzles were not entertaining, and the challenges were either too simple or too hard. I would not recommend this game. I agree with others, buy Siberia I & II, or The Longest Journey. These are far superior to Forever Worlds"
1,Save Your Money!!!!!!,"This is the very worst adventure game I have ever played. SAVE YOUR MONEY! For starters, it does not work on windows 98 unless you run media player first each and everytime. (It took me 5 days to find out how to get it working on my system, no help from the company web site) Second, it is just plain STUPID! The jokes on the game and the free walkthrough are so stupid I had to keep forcing myself to come back and continue to play. The only reason I continued was beacuse I had $20.00 and alot of time wrapped up in this game. If someone offers to give this game to you for free, save yourself the frustration and just refuse the offer. BAD BAD BAD"
4,Try playing together,"My niece came over and started to play this game and I was only trying to help her, but we ended up having an amazing time with this game. She laughed and laughed at the some of the animation scenes and it made me think because I had already seen some of them and skipped over them. But I took another look and when we played it together it was a lot more fun. There are some really funny combinations of things in here. Playing with her made me have a much better time than when I first started. I thought I should pass that along."
1,Awful! Why didn't I read these reviews before purchasing?,"I honestly don't know why I didn't look at these reviews before I purchased this game. I don't know the technical terms -- (interface?) but simply moving through the game is excruciatingly difficult, and the screen goes to black and you suddenly appear someplace new -- you can't actually see yourself ""move."" I am a huge fan of Nancy Drew PC games and Syberia I and II. Not only are they fascinating, but it's easy to move through the game -- you don't even think about it. This was a huge struggle, no fun at all, and I was very happy to give up on it."
5,Excellent family game,"We loved this game. The whole family played along and we had a great time. It was funny and magical and we even went back and replayed our favorite parts. We have played some of the other recent games, but this one is our favorite. The puzzles are very, very unusual with unexpected challenges and even more unexpected results. Everyone liked Ix - the little talking lizard who sits on your shoulder. I would definitely recommend this to families who play together.The one level with the volcano was a little more difficult as it was hard to find your way around, but I think that was the point so I don't want to hold that against it. It just slowed us down a little as it was easy to get lost. But if you like unusual characters and something new and fresh compared to other games, this is the one."
1,JUNK,full of adds i got it because a few years ago they had $10 coupons for amazon in it. not worth it anymore- waste of money
1,Disappointing!,"I'd ordered Parenting Early Years, got couple of issues and they were ok. Then I've decided to subscribe for Parenting school years either. Today I got my first August!!!! issue... I've already had my September issue of Early Years for 3 weeks now. And I am also really disappointed with the content because it duplicates Early Years' issue completely, except advertisements. I don't get the publisher's idea to print one content with two different covers and distribute this as two different magazines."
1,Paid Advertising,"My subscription is being cancelled as it has never been satisfactorily straightened out for delivery. The few issues I got contained advertising for lots of upscale, pricey items, many of which had limited usefulness and doubtful necessity. In one issue, an piece related to dressing yourself and your kids to resemble famous individuals featured on entertainment TV and magazines, somehow seemed inappropriate considering too many children have an inflated sense of entitlement and a ""gimme"" attitude supported by a sense that happiness is based on looks and trendy possessions. The less shallow articles were similar to what could be read in a variety of other magazines that also offer parentings tips or information."
5,great magazine,"I have had a subscription for this magazine before and I have enjoyed reading it, it has great tips on all different subjects parents deal with in raising their children. It was a free gift subscription for a year and couldn't pass it up, Great buy"
1,Horrible customer service from publisher Bonnier,"My experience was similar to the previous reviewer. I also thought it was worth $5. But the publisher also kept sending me out the incorrect version and sent out dated issues. When I contacted the publisher, they completely ignored my complaint about the issues being out of date. After 3 emails from me, 2 weeks later the publisher told me I should contact Amazon to get the correct version of the magazine.BUT Amazon had great customer service!! They responded in less than 24 hours of me sending an e-mail, credited me in full for the magazine and gave me an extra goodwill credit."
1,Publisher sent me the wrong edition as well!!!,"I ordered early years- they started sending me school years, dated issues, too! Bonnie Publishing had horrible customer service- couldn't get it resolved, kept making ME do all the legwork for THEIR error. Amazon CS was great though, credited me back in one day. I WON""T be trying to get the correct version again because their CS was so horrible."
2,"Wrong version, sent July issue when October issue was already out","The magazine is ok though rather thin on content (I'd rather have the older format back) but I thought for $5, I might as well subscribe. Am pretty disappointed. Update: am attempting to get the correct version. They are insisting to transfer only effective January, which means I'll only get 6 issues of a magazine I paid a year for, and that I should contact Amazon to get the correct version.Most recent email:Dear Ms. xxx,We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We received your Parenting School Years order through third party. We transferred this subscription to Parenting Early Years for 05 issues as 06 issues are already served. The last issue of Parenting School Years you will receive is December/January 2010 issue. Please contact Amazon for further assistance.Thank you for subscribing to Parenting Early Years."
1,I would enter zero stars if I could...,"The Parenting Magazine of nowandays is a very different version of what it used to be years ago. Devoid of content, full of ads and extremely thin. They claim to have two different 'versions' - Parenting (the early years) and Parenting (the school years). I thought great! Until I started receiving both and they are virtually the exact same magazine. It takes a five minutes to flip thru the magazine. Save yourself some $$ and don't buy it. You can read the whole thing standing in line in the grocery store."
2,Not my kind of magazine.,"I have used Parent's magazine for years. I tried this one because of a deal, and it is just not the same for me. The magazine seems smaller. I lean more conservative than this magazine, so probably another reason why it wasn't a fit for me."
1,"Boring magazine designed to get you to buy, buy, buy",This magazine is super boring. It's all about what you can buy for your child at certain ages. There isn't much useful advice or even interesting stories. It's an advertisement in disguise.
2,Geared towards a select group of parents,I got this for my daughter who has a child 2-1/2 and a baby 8 months old. She found that many of the articles were geared towards older children. She found an item or two per issue that might have been useful.
3,Not always impressed,"For the most part the articles are informative and fun to read. Last year, in 2010 they had some WAY GOOD coupons, but I haven't seen them lately (Summer 2011). Last year I would have given this a 5 star for the coupons alone. However, if I have to rate on the articles I would have to give a three. Sometimes they are based on one doctors opinion, which is interesting to read, but isn't necessarily who I'm going to trust on new info. Still worth the subscription I paid. Not sure I would pay the list subscription price though."
1,Late issues full of ads,"I have had many problems with this magazine (and shipping company). I had paid for a two year subscription but the with in the first 6 months I missed two issues, when I complained the company I was told those issues were out of stock and I would get 2 months added onto my subscription. The other 4 months were late....and I don't mean a few days late, I mean months late. It was like they didn't have anything to send me so they would send the July issue in September! What a joke. Dealing with the company is even worse, but I did finally manage to get a full refund. As for the magazine itself save your money. It's nothing but ads. None of the articles are written from a serious stand-point and many articles are about clothing style, make-up and hair products for mothers. If I wanted to read about that I would by Lucky, Style, or Cosmo!"
2,Old issues sent!,I have gotten two issues so far and they both are old issues! I got December/January at the end of February and February's at the end of March. Looks like all the newstands get the new ones and we get what they don't sell. No thank you!
2,Good for some coupons!,"Plain and simple, after a few copies arrived in the mail and I had a chance to read this magazine, I realized it was a waste of money. Before canceling the subscription, I simply looked for the coupons inside and then threw it in the garbage. The information you get here, you can get from open sources like the internet or a good book. If you are into magazines and have the time, you might like it. I don't have much time, and only subscribed because I'm a new parent and wanted to have some backup. For me, this magazine didn't do the trick, but everyone is different."
1,ZERO STARS!!! THEY SEND OUT-DATED ISSUES.,"Please do not purchase this magazine unless you like reading old news and enjoy making a scrapbook of expired coupons. I ordered this magazine in December only to receive a November issue in my mailbox during the second week of January. So I suppose I am to take all of the Christmas gift ideas that are in it and apply them to next year. And I am so looking forward to getting February's Valentine's issue in time for Easter. - What a joke! Mind you I did contact their customer service who bascially said ""yeah, that's right""."
1,Nothing but Ads,"I unknowingly got subscribed to this ""magazine"" after shopping at Motherhood and naively leaving my address details with them. Took a lot of hassle to cancel. Aside from such awful business practices, this mag is nothing but a vehicle for ads. Seriously, every article links to products, I found nothing of use or substance. Definitely give this a miss."
1,LATE ISSUES AND EXPIRED COUPONS!!!,"Just today, April 22, I received my MARCH issue of parenting. There was a $10 off coupon inside for the baby store. That coupon expired March 31, 2011. It's basically like losing $10. Not to mention I never received my April issue and my May issue should have been received by April 19. Who knows how much money I've ""lost"" by not getting my issues on time. But they sure did get thier subscription payment from me on time!! I'm very upset! I only gave it 1 star because I was forced to give it something."
2,BLECH,"1st-All of my issues have been at least 1 or 2 months old. (I got the Jan issue in March)2nd-I wasn't even supposed to get this magazine. [...] had a rebate offer. spend a certain amount and get a free subscription to this mag OR simply opt out of the mag and get a rebate check for $[...]. I asked for the rebate check and got the mag instead.3rd-I don't even like the magazine. I find it to be a little too sarcastic, too brazen, too tacky, and too sassy for my liking. It's like a magazine with a chip on it's shoulder and a bad attitude. While I don't necessarily consider myself prudish, proper or demure...it's just a little too much for me. It's like they're trying to hard to be funny & cool. No thanks."
3,It was free,"I wouldn't have paid for it. It's fun for flipping through to see new toys, maybe an idea or two... it is what it is."
2,It's January and I received the November issue!,"So... not only is all the info old news, but the coupons are all expired! I got a 2 month old Magazine...hope next months isn't Decembers issue since it will be February. Don't really feel like reading about Holiday toys when I should be reading about Valentines day stuff. Lame!"
1,Happened to me too!,"I actually love the magazine so the one star is only for the company who ships it out! Like some other reviewers I got my first issue in late April of 2010 and it was the March issue. If you know anything about this magazine you know that the March issue actually comes out in February and all thats in it has early March in mind - sweepstakes, dates, shows etc.So I feel like the others: they dump their leftover old issues on you and it counts towards your one-year subscription. Shame on you Bonnier corp."
1,Wrong Product,"I got a solicitation from Amazon to renew a subscription I purchased last spring for my daughter-in-law. After reading all the bad reviews I asked my daughter-in-law to confirm if she was getting the Early Year as I had subscribed for her, or just the regular Parenting magazine. She confirmed she has not been getting Parenting Early Years. Okay, I take some responsibility for just assuming. But I will NEVER subscribe to a magazine through Amazon again no matter how cheap. I guess you get what you pay for and I don't need the headache and hassle."
3,I hope the issue with all the expired stuff doesn't count,I just got my first issue in mid-March. It's teh Feb issue with contests and stuff that expire in January. Plus what does make-up have to do with Parenting?
4,A good basic beginner's book.,"Too bad this book is out of print. I have a 1971 edition and checked to see if there was an updated version. This book is a good back-up reference if you're stuck on a specific physics theory such as inertia or angular momentum. It's very simple and descriptive. I used it recently to explain, to a co-worker, why sunsets are red in color and how geysers work. I imagine it that it would have been great as a high school physics textbook."
2,Warning,This book is a reprint of the first edition published in 1977. Do not buy if you are looking for information on modern Ferrari's.
5,"The Little Book ""You Are The One""","A message very well executed by the author, Christopher L. Harper.A message that can be shared with ALL ages, because the book was so well written, simple. A message I continually see, daily, after I reviewed the author's words.In summary, it's a beautiful book written with much passion for ALL mankind, through the eye's of Jesus Christ. I recommend this book for ALL to read, because it will MOVE YOU in the right direction."
4,Eagles NFL Shirt,Very pleased with the short wait time for the jersey. It was everything I hoped for.
3,Wildly overpriced,"These headphones, while very comfortable, are vastly overpriced for their sound quality..."
5,"Insightful and Thrilling -- Moscow, Tibet, Cuba...the World","I must agree with Wolf Blitzer's opinion of this book: What a treat! Reading the End of Revolution is like sitting down to talk with a fascinating journalist who has seen amazing events and can describe them and explain them in such a way that you are mesmerized and fascinated.The author takes you all over the world, from the Amazon to Tibet, and dozens of places in between. It describes the crises that have made news in the world in ways that at last make real sense.After years of watching CNN and others, this book gave me the perspective I had always hoped to find. The book explains our world while entertaining and offering insightful commentary and an unusual look behind the scenes at the world of television news. I highly recommend it.Brian Kohl"
5,An Adventure of Mind and Soul,"What an unbelievable voyage!Ghitis took me on a guided tour of the world, showing me places I'd never seen. Making me care about what goes on, and showing me why it matters.The world makes more sense after reading this book. It was an incredible adventure. Read this book."
5,A must for students of Gaelic History,"'The Annals of the Four Masters' is one of the most important documents for students of Irish, British, European and ancient history. You will not find much of this history in your high school or even college text books. John O'Donovan, a 19th century antiquarian undertook the enormous task of interpreting this account of Irish history as written in gaelic by the Four Masters, legendary scribes from a Donegal monastery. On the left hand page you get the original gaelic text, on the right the english translation, some anecdotes are in Latin. The anecdotes are as rich in reading as the text and include some by the late 19th century historian Charles O'Conor of Belengare, Ireland. REPRINT THESE VOLUMES....for here lie the dormant pages of Irish, British, Norman, Saxon, Scotish, Iberian, Hiberian, Milesian, Pictish and Gaelic history and perhaps the key to unraveling are current problems.Stephen Vincent O`Rourke"
5,One of a kind,"The Annals of Ireland by the Four Masters is a treasured find for any researcher. O'Donovans translation was excellent for the day. He was actually the second to publish the annals for the 12th to the 17th centuries. A few years before O'Donovan, in 1846, Owen Connellan published the first ever translation of the annals into English, plus the family name location map. There had been quite a competition between the two to come out with the first edition of the annals. I have both translations in hardbound editions. They sit side by side on our shelves. It is quite interesting to compare the two."
2,Bad Farelly Brothers rip-off!,The soundtrack had Lakota on it which is the only part of the movie I liked outside of the nudity.
1,Misleading Advertisement and Product,"The photo and description describes this order as being multiple trumpet mutes. In reality it is only the copper bottom straight trumpet mute. So be aware that you are only getting this mute and not others as show in the photo or suggested by the description that starts with the phrase ""Trumpets Mutes""."
4,A realistic look at Sadat,"Sadat's image is largely a result of his later peacemaking efforts. What is largely neglected by those who learn about Sadat is his early flirtation with Nazi Germany, his acceptance of Nasser's authoritarian regime, his own ""correction"" of the revolution which placed him in power and, of course, his role as war leader in the October War.This book looks realistically at Sadat and how we ran Egypt following Nasser's death up to his own assassination. The author looked at primary sources and interviewed many of the key players of those years, opponents and proponents alike, in order to get a clear picture despite the murky nature of Egyptian politics.This is more of a scholarly work than recreational reading and it helps if you already have a working knowledge of Egypt's recent history. This book gives the reader a clearer look at Sadat the politician, Sadat the leader, Sadat the thinker... in effect, Sadat the human being."
4,fascinating,"States of Mind is a fascinating book, offering opinions from some of the top neuroscientists and brain researchers in the country. LeDoux writes about fear, and what actually happens in our brain when we are afraid. Jamison writes about the connection between creativity and manic depression. If we cure manic depression, do we destroy creativity? Very interesting reading. And easy to comprehend by the lay person."
2,Rather poor,"While the authors of the series of lectures which make up this book have wonderful credentials as scientists, they are not very good writers. It isn't that they are unclear, so much as that they are dull and awkward. Mindful of their own research, some of the material is not very interesting either, although nuggets do shine through. I do recommend that anyone who can get hold of this book read pl. 24-27 on the neuroscience of cocaine addiction, because that section is a gem. Its explanation transcends cocaine addiction and clarifies a whole bunch of more general ideas: molecular substitutes, dynamics of receptor formation and reversibility, learning."
1,Horrible product,"I put this on some cleaned exterior vinyl/plastic with poor results. It's runny, very hard to control, and doesn't apply evenly, even with several coats. It smeared all over and would not wipe off paint/aluminum finishes. It looks nasty, and I will have to repaint those trim areas.If you have to use it, my advice is to mask it all off but doubt the tape would stop it from seeping. Thumbs down."
5,"So far, so good","We have a 97 Jeep Cherokee and the black vinyl wheel surround (not sure of the term) had faded terribly, they were almost a whitish grey. We applied about 3 coats of this product (it goes on easily with the applicator bottle it comes with). The first coat was splotchy because the vinyl soaked up the stuff. Then, by the 2nd and 3rd coat, it was becoming more of an even coat. Whalaa, I cannot believe the difference. I will try to post before and after pictures. It has made a huge difference in how the vehicle looks, and now we will see how it holds up over time. We had enough to do three coats around all four wheels. There seems to be enough in the bottle to repeat another treatment if necessary in the future. I would recommend this product."
5,Forever Black Dye,I am quite impressed with this dye. I've used it on a set of running boards and a similar piece on the back bumper. The vehicle is a Toyota Sequoia. The plastic on the parts look like new. I also used it around exterior mirror parts (also black plastic)on a Mercedes SUV. The black parts do not look aged and faded. The liquid is thin and you may have to use a sponge brush to get in between the grooves on running boards. Great product!!
1,Weak,Great cinematographyWeak repressed charactersI turned it off to take a piss which was far more pleasing.
1,Beautiful Planet - Spain & Portugal Blu-ray,"Save you hard earned money, the cover is miss-leading, the content lingers on the same subject mater seems for ever."
5,Melanie At Her Best,"Melanie's career had many musical detours. She was an artist searching for an appropriate genre to fit her voice. At her best, "" Gather Me"", "" Stoneground Words"" and "" Madrugada"" she was a force to be taken seriously. ""Photograph"" was her most mature work, but at times, she sounded forced. At her worst, "" As I See It Now"" ( Bad country). "" Arabesque"" ( too middle of the road and not enough vocal challenges) and "" Am I Real or What?"" ( Bad Disco!!!!). On this album Melanie sounded comfortable in the rock genre. It is an amazing album and a great tribute to a misunderstood artist. Her voice was never better and her phrasing is pure bliss. Too bad this album never found an audience. It would have certainly put Melanie on the top. Today Melanie has lost much of her voice. But, as a songwriter she has matured nicely. Too bad very few will get to hear the brilliant songs she is currently writing. Melanie's future as a vocalist is over, but as a writer it has, hopefully, just started."
5,Dancing in the Street,"A great album by one of the music industry's most consistent performers. Singer/songwriter Melanie writes most of the material on this album but is not afraid to sing other people's songs. On this album, in particular, she features with a band and plays live to small studio-sized audiences. Altogether, a very different Melanie album that should be considered one of her funkiest!"
3,not the official flag,The flag was worth the money spent but I was informed by my husband who is a retired Seabee Iraqi vet that this is not the official flag...he pointed out several things wrong with it from the colors to the classes on the arm...so if you want to do something special for your Seabee this is not the flag to get.
2,Earlier novels better,"The Belascoarán series has long been one of my favorites and more or less inaugurated detective fiction in Mexico in a unique form that could be classified as a subgenre. That said, Taibo's earlier novels are much better. As one goes from older to more recent, the plots of the novels suffer, giving way to essentially political tirades that make the reading tedious. The better novels of the series are Cosa Fácil, Algunas Nubes and Amorosos Fantasmas. Another of his great books is Sombra de la Sombra. This latest novel was so far-fetched as to border on the ridiculous."
4,A different kind of Iggy,"Some people might bash this cd due to it's calmer nature and such but I personally enjoyed this album. While this is by no means Raw Power or Fun house, this is still a pretty good album. Iggy shows of his talents as a song writer here as evidenced by such songs as mainstreet eyes and home and a few others. While this is by no means his best stuff it is enjoyable and has a few classic Iggy songs like Candy and Home, also my baby likes to rock and roll is a nice song that is similar to Iggy's roots. Featuring guest apperances by Kate peirson and slash this is a very enjoyable album that I would suggest getting AFTER you have explored some of Iggy's other stuff don't just get this after listening to The stooges or you will be dissapointed. All in all a good album and reccomended."
5,Iggy is not for the squeamish,"If you don't like his profanity-laced ranting, then this album isn't for you. However, if you like honest, butt-kicking rock 'n roll this is your album. Candy is a great tune (Always like Kate Pierson's voice). Home, Buttown, and My Baby likes to Rock and Roll are classic."
2,It had it's moments...,"This album has it's moments. Neon Forest had some fun lyrical imagery. The Undefeated is my favorite Iggy song, period. But one expects more than a few *moments* to make a good album. For the most part, the arrangements are uninspired, the performances sloppy, and (most importantly) most of the songs suck. The title track, with its ""I get off my d---; I'm living brick by brick"" refrain is criminally inane. Butt Town, Pussy Power, etc... these songs are even worse than the titles suggest and Living on the Edge of Night is more cliched."
5,Iggy's best moments with good friends,"This is maybe one of the most worked and complet records of Iggy (maybe the most of all), and, as for me, one of the best ones. This time Iggy has very good friends and musicians with him. Let me mark some songs as Candy (nice Kate Pierson), Neon Forest, Pussy Power, Brick by Brick and all the rest. Amazing!"
2,Implausable,"The plot is really quite silly and almost totally implausable. The characters are neither very interesting nor well developed. Still, the book kept me going to the contrived trick ending.More narrow escapes and deus ex machinas, and I never heard so many people crying, ""pleeease"". I'm surprised they didn't contrive a way to save Laura's long-lost brother. Just about all the other good guys got saved. It's not fair now is it?Just a few, out of many many logic questions: how did that zombie farm get a no fly-over agreement? how come nobody thought to bury the bodies of the two people killed at the beginning? What happened to the cancer cure?Laura's brother, zombified, half-dead, still managed to continuously beat up whole packs of armed and dangerous baddies...Say, now that I think of it, I'd like to change my rating from 3 to a 2."
2,Implausible and melodramatic,"This book should appeal to 14 year old boys. The pace is pretty quick, but the writing is melodramatic. Overall, the story is improbable, the characters are hard to believe in, and my interest strayed. Put it this way: halfway through the book, I put it down and forgot all about it for almost a week."
5,Extreme Measures,A good read. Michael Palmer is a talented author and I have found most of his books have just enough intrigue to keep one's interest.
3,Good Thriller Despite Stereotypes,"I've enjoyed several of Michael Palmer's books and have found them to be real pageturners. He has very good storylines and my only problem with his work is that he stereotypes a lot of characters, e.g., receptionists are always polishing nails or cracking gum, thugs are always dumb, other characters (other than the hero) are far too one dimensional, and the heroine never has any faults. That's expected and forgiven in a first novel, but by the third or fourth, the author should be getting better at character development.As for page-turning worthiness, this book is really better than a three-star review - but too much stereotyping really bothers me. This author can do better."
5,"Good book, good story.",This is actually the first book of Michael Palmer I have been reading. I've gone through a few chapter and it was exciting. It make me think of how each charecter will act in each situation. Keeping me turn page after page. You should try it!!
4,Classic Soca,"Some classic Soca tracks from Byron Lee & the Dragonaires. This is ""old school"" Soca from the early 90's and might not appeal to a younger audience. Add a star for the CD cover photo!"
3,"Second Half of the Songwriting Team on ""Cruel to Be Kind""","Ian was buddies with Nick Lowe for years, and co-wrote ""Cruel to Be Kind"". He has a poppy style that is enjoyable, but he lacks the songwriting chops of Nick. Still an enjoyable release for anyone who loves power pop."
4,Great pictures,"Elk hunting is such a broad topic that it would be unreasonable to expect a book this small to do it justice. And, this book doesn't do it justice. It is dated and simplistic. But ohhhh the pictures. There are great pictures."
2,"""What's an elk?""","Perfect book for someone who has zero experience with elk hunting. I've picked up a couple of bits of info from it, but it's not going to change the way you move throught the woods. Happy hunting!"
5,"Something Happens, Somthing Special!","As the years pass, my mind has a way of filtering out the fluff from the good stuff. CDs that consumed me ten years ago often slip off my radar completely, never to be listened to again. This is not the case with Stuck Together With God's Glue. This is a really great piece of work, and though it's coming up on twenty years of age, it is still fresh, positive, energetic and evocative of pre-boom Ireland - there's still an innocence to it and this is what I love about it.For those from Ireland, I saw Something Happens in one of the first 'Trips to Tipp' in the early nineties. Special memories for sure, and this CD takes me right back. This comes very highly recommended from me."
5,Superb jangly guitar pop-rock,"I bought this album on vinyl in 1994 based on a good review; I'd never heard them before, but I've never regretted the purchase. It had me tapping my feet and humming along right from the start, and I'm still listening to it 12 years down the line. Did they produce any other records? Whatever happened to Something Happens? If you want to try something that will keep you listening for years to come, then buy this album!"
3,Horses for Beginners,"This is the perfect book for people that know very little about horses. It covers the basics of most equine topics, and is in an easy-to-read format. I unfortunately did not find this book useful. Anyone past the ""intermediate"" stage may become board with it due to its lack of advanced excercises and vice-solving. For more dedicated riders I would recommend ""The Complete Training of Horse and Rider"" by Col. Alois Podhajsky. Once again, this is a good book for beginners but not intermediate or advanced riders."
4,Good book!,This book was good as far as literally being a book for dummies or for those with little to no experience at all! I was hoping for more of an informational book on problems but was pleased with what little was in this book!
2,not quite accurate,"I found this book to be very good, but lacks information on horse breeds. Not all of the horse breeds are represented."
5,Cool,"I like the way it's made, attractive for students and lots of great information; a great addition to my material, yes it gets ""corny"" at times, if that's still a word, but it works."
3,Driver Ed To Go,"This is good for teen agers but I was teaching someone older. It just wasnt what I wanted,but it is a good product.......I also bought Rules of the road & that was the one that helped most....she got her temps...................."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I eagerly awaited this 3rd episode and was very disappointed. The graphics are not as good as the 1st two games, and the use of the arrow keys, rather than the mouse, was cumbersome. I r ead that the creators of the game say that this is the future of adventure games. I certainly hope not as, in my opinion, the mouse action is so much smoother. The rich color of the 1st two games was amazing, and since this game is several years ahead, I expected more in the way of lush graphics. It was not there. It was difficult to get the characters to move in straight lines. I found the game concentrated too much on eye-hand quick coordination to get through many parts, rather than logic. I did not enjoy spending hours trying to progress through the game by learning which keys to press, in which order, and doing it without missing a beat. To me, that is not an ""adventure game"" but rather a game of beating the clock. I finally through in the towel about 3/4 through."
2,Hindered by annoying copy protection,The copy protection for this game installs a system driver and causes the game to take over a minute to start each time. Super-annoying.
3,Ok game,"I would consider this more of a platform game than an Adventure game. The character interaction is great, and the graphics and locations are cool, but my biggest problem has been with the timed projects that need to be completed. I don't know if I just need a better graphics card, or what but I had a really hard time getting my characters to move where I wanted them to. With the timed events this becomes a serious problem. Other than that it is overall a good game."
1,Disappointing,"I love this genre of games and this game sounded like it had a lot of promise. It has turned into the most disappointing game I have ever played. In my opinion, it is a follow-the-directions kind of game. There are few, if any, puzzles. There are many scenes in which you die and then have to repeat the whole scene over and over and over again in order to move on. I actually purchased a game controller because one scene could not be accomplished via the keyboard. Well, the game controller didn't help much either. This game volleys back and forth between boring and frustrating. Not a good combination. Save your money. Don't buy it."
2,Video Studio 5.0 Disappoints,"Had previously used video editing software that came free with a PCI TV card I had installed, was ready for an upgrade and thought this was the answer to my problems (mainly associated with different output formats). Story board editing is very simplistic and gets old fast. Very good for those who have no exposure to video editing software, my expectations were a bit higher. Limited control of most aspects, so be prepared for restricted editing. Many problems with program crashing while creating movies. It is mostly capable of putting clips in an order and selecting transitions to go in-between, if that is all you need this is the editor for you. I would recommend finding another video editing title for most everyone else, my search continues..."
3,I've seen beter,"This program is great for someone who has no idea what they are doing(at all). If you are going to do anything serious don't buy it. If you have the money to spend, save it, in 2 mins. you could find much better, for the same price or less."
1,Difficult to use,"I received Ulead Video Studio Version 5.0 with my 1394 adapter card. I find it very difficult to use.As a user of Windows XP, I could only get it to run for users designated as PC Administrator. Limited Users could not run the software.I did not find it to be intuitive to use even though each menu item across the top provides an illustrative picture and sequence of steps.It appears on the surface to be easy to use however I had problems with editing clips and music. It appears it has many features and options. I spent 2 hours trying to edit a 30 second video clip and gave up with a headache. I had difficulty trying to preview minor changes (e.g. adding a title). The software would go through the Rendering step each time which would take about a minute or two."
2,Video Studio vs. Windows Movie Maker,"After upgrading to Windows ME I realized I had wasted a hundred bucks on Video Studio software. Like many others, I was hesitant to upgrade to ME because of reports of computer lockups,crashes,etc. Rumors circulated that WinME had many bugs that had yet to be resolved. Total hogwash. I realize now that I made a mistake by not upgrading sooner. The Windows Movie Maker software included with WinME was a pleasant suprise. I prefer it to Video Studio and Studio DV(Pinnacle). It doesn't include everything that the two major titles do, but it has everything u would want, without options that u would never use. After all, these movies won't be released in the local theatres.If u haven't upgraded yet, remember that the cost of the upgrade to WinME will be the same or less than either of the two major movie making software titles!! Think about it. Rodger"
3,A good read,"This book falls in that genre that mixes SF with fantasy. It's a good enough book for those rainy days. Not one you'll be thinking about later, though.Fleeing an interstellar war that would possibly mean the destruction of Earth, a human colony is launched to a distant planet. However the Morkth catch up with them on the new planet. Betrayals and fights end in a standoff. Both races are now on the planet and unable to leave.300 years later, the new human society resembles Earth in the 16th century.A thief ,a warrior, a princess and a member from the original human crew set out to find the 'magic' stones that will provide the struggling colony with a way to beat the aliens."
4,"Excellent, but needs a sequel","This is an excellent, entertaining, very well written book. The only thing it lacks is a sequel. The plot line SCREAMs for continuation. There is obviously a great deal of prior action that could use filling out, and as far as the future - it kinds of reads like the first book in a trilogy."
4,"Fine, well-constructed and well written hard sf adventure.",Find the sections of the key or humanity on this colony planet will be wiped out by the alien space-traveling Morkth. Interesting characters are forced to co-operate in an impossible task.
5,Does the job!,Love it! have used it time after time already and it has not failed me once nor will it ever.
4,Nice Pin,I really like this pin. Its size and weight are just right. I use it primarily for pasta dough.
3,Effective but a bit hard to handle,"I got this on the advice of ATK. It does its job and rolls out dough nicely enough. I find its size to be too large for me though, and probably should have gone w/ a model with tapered ends. Might be because have smaller hands, but for me it's just too bulky"
5,Pie Crusts in the future.....,Hi guys.....I was reading Cooks Country in which tells us what they think is the best and the price too...we haven't used it yet but will get with it toward the end of the year...I put alot of belief in these people...I know I got a good one...Pie man to be....Don A.
4,straight line,not as long as i would have wanted but is more that enough for the average job. the pin is solid maple and straight as an arrow.
5,Finally getting there...,"It appears that we are finally getting where this novel has taken us a while ago already: to overcome capitalism! It is as dead as Socialism has been 20 years ago. Capitalism has not survived Socialism, but only outlasted it. Now, is the time for the penguins to tell us how to overcome it once and for all. It is all so damned easy, we just have to do it and make this fairy tale come true for us all! This is the book of the year!"
1,Worst Siavash Album Ever!!,I am WAS a big fan of Siavash and I loved his two first successful albums Hamsayeha(1990) and Sahneh(1993). Then he realsed Ok albums such as Pedar(1995). but after that. I dont know what happend to him. He released some disappointing albums such as Didar(1996) and Scream(1997)(only one song i liked in this album which is aghaze eshgh). And now he released another album which in my opinion is the worst persian album i ever heard.Not a single song is considerd to be any good. I really dont wish him to release another album cuz i know what it will be like.
1,Unuseable and filled with errors,This is a cut up version of Huang's Statistical Mechanics book intended for an undergraduate audience. The book is filled with mathmatical errors (or a lot of misprints) and grammatical errors. The chapters are only 3-4 pages on average with absolutely no insight or examples. The problems range from very easy to out of the scope of the book when you go from chapter to chapter. If I could have rated this book a negative value I would have. If you are looking for a starting point for Statistical Mechanics I would look somewhere else because this book is completely useless as far as I am concerned.
4,"A decent, but often maligned text","I can understand the poor reviews, but this book is clearly not intended as a primary text when taking a course on statistical mechanics.It is a fantastic reference book for upper level undergraduate and introductory graduate courses in statistical mechanics. It covers a lot of ground in just 300 pages, without being mathematically demanding, and yet carries lots of insight.It is concise and the problems are well-chosen. Pair it with a more complete textbook (which is easy to find) for a better overall picture. But it is excellent for what it does."
5,Excellent reference work for the experienced Windows admin,"This is an excellent book for those of us who have extensive experience with previous Windows releases, and need information dealing with just what's new and improved in Windows Server 2003. This book is well-written, well-organized, easy to read, and gives you everything you need, and nothing you don't.I highly recommend this book to all experienced Windows Server administrators who need just the new info and just the facts, from authors who actually know what they're talking about."
3,Troubling Inaccuracies and omissions,"Page 78: windows clients DO NOT require a GC server to find a domain controller.Page 130: stub zones are NOT secondary zones with glue records. They contain read-only SOA, NS and ""glue"" A records and nothing else."
1,Not Reader Friendly,"This book does discuss the different elements of literacy like reading, writing, proficient/non proficient of both, yet is NOT reader friendly. I am using it for a graduate level course and have a horrible time trying to understand what I am to be reading. I would not recommend this text."
2,this book is not magic,"this doen't start that bad. a family moves to a town of pagan heritage. something hidden ""wants to come out"". the son get attracted to the heritage, and the mother gets worried. but in the end, the whole book ends up in tedious naive descriptions of magic done in a boring way. i really don't mind magic in horror, but this is done here in such an uninteresting and naive way. mediocre."
3,Canvas shoe bag,"Its stirdy, washable. I've been able to store my boots sideways. However the canvas is thinner than expected and the product's finish is bad: extra thread falling from seams and the stitching of the pockets is crooked. So I had to find the pockets that were big enough to fit my size 8 women's athletic shoes and designate the smaller pockets for slippers and sandels. Maybe I just got the defective one in the lot...don't know, but I can live with it. Its behind the door anyway and not worth the price of shipping it back.8-5-06In hindsight, I should have just gone to my nearest Big Lots or discount store. I've seen much better quality there at lower prices."
3,"This is 18"", not 16"" wide.","The product description here is inaccurate. When the item arrived, the packaging said it was 18"" -- and indeed it was."
2,I should have done some math and saved myself $15,I should have done the math using the dimensions and number of pockets beforehand to figure out that there's no way the pockets would have been wide enough to hold most of my shoes.
1,no hardware--how irritating!,"This would have been a great bargain except for the profoundly irritating absence of the hanging hooks that were supposed to be enclosed. Since another reviewer had the same criticism, maybe this is something Amazon should look into."
1,doesn't work on newer construction doors,"The hangers on this are about 1 1/4"" deep for hanging. My doors are 1 3/8"", being new construction with good quality standards. The hooks are pretty strong, so there's no way to bend them and make them fit. And no way to close the door. Instead, I now need to touch up the paint at the top of the door from where I attempted to make the hooks fit.Also, if you have higher ceilings with the not uncommon 8' doors, you'd need a ladder to get to the top pockets easily.This product set a personal record for delivery to return time."
1,problem with hooks,I ordered three of these and the canvas portion looks sturdy and well made but the hoods DO NOT work on standard doors. They are too small and stick up to high to close the door. Contacted the manufactuer and got a prompt reponse but they do not offer larger hooks. They are useless to me. Also had to wait three weeks to receive.
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"This product is advertised as ""sturdy canvas"" when it is anything but. It is thin and flimsy at best, and then I discovered that, no surprise here, it's MADE IN CHINA. I would rather pay MORE money for better quality than the inferior crap ""American"" companies are distributing these days.I will now ask where a product is made PRIOR to purchasing it. This is nothing short of sabotaging our own economy for personal profit (more than ""lower prices"".....)"
1,I think I bought the wrong CD,"This was recommended to me by Amazon.com after I had bought a couple of techo & trance CD's. This does not fit under that category, and I didn't enjoy it..."
1,"Wrong Album, BEWARE","The MP3 Version is some crappy Italian thing. Its been switched. As for my rating for the real album, I don't know because I haven't heard it."
4,"Cheap, Good...","Some of the highlights on this compilation are the Eno tracks from The Drop, Nerve Net, and The Shutov Assembly. The non-Eno tracks are consistently good as well, particularly Budd's track from The White Arcades. For a sampler, the album has a really good sequence to it. It has a sort of This Mortal Coil effect on you, where every track is unique but it adds up to a consistent whole. Aural Wallpaper indeed."
5,Great Compulation at a Bargin Price,"Just added this to an order for fun, I enjoy ultra modern music, but not new age, what a miss nomer. I have researched and purchased additional music because of the selects on this CD."
5,Nostalgic Classic,I enjoy this CD because it brings me back to being a kiddo. The lyrics are elemental but Brent has a great voice.
4,very good cd,"I stumbled upon this cd and made the connection with Bourgeois Tagg. I had enjoyed their ""Yoyo"" album so i bought this on a whim. So glad i did because i enjoyed it so much. I still pull it out of my cd collection every now and then. I have his second solo cd as well and although it has a more pop feel to it, i like it very much as well. I think he became ""born again"" because his 3rd cd is definately ""christian pop"". That's fine with me, but he lost me a bit going in that direction musically."
5,A Great Diet,My husband and I are on our 8th day of this diet and we are both feeling fantastic. It may seem complicated at first and the weighing and measuring may seem daunting but just wade right in and it all makes sense and becomes habit very quickly. There are some delicious recipes and it is an amazing thing to sit down to meals that are cooked with butter and cream and mayonaise and all those things that we have denied ourselves for years and to actually be loosing weight. I recommend this book compleatly.
2,A Big Fat Lie,"COLONY OF LIES is a woefully disappointing novel, not least because there are comparatively so few adventures available with the 2nd Doctor at the helm. Author Brake manages to capture some of the flavor of the Troughton era, and comes as near as he's able to portraying the characters as we knew them; the trouble lies in the feeling of an enormous amount of padding to bring this work in at novel length. The attempts to infuse the tale with a sense of the Old West fail miserably, this tack being used strictly in an effort to come up with a ""'Doctor Who' western"". Bleh -- ""The Gunfighters"" was more entertaining and (blessedly) much shorter. I wonder whether David A. McIntee and/or Mark Gatiss could be influence to take further strolls through the 2nd Doctor's era?..."
3,Maybe I have to read this book again...,"I read this book sometime in Nov. of '08. Though a lot of the content seemed pretty fluffy, like I was hugging a stuffed Jesus, a lot of Ms. Jones' material DID bring light to a lot of subjects. I probably need to read this book once more, forget about the ""How Did She Get This?"" chapter titles, and read a little deeper into the subject matter.Good book for beginners."
2,The most self centered little boy in the world,This is less a chronicle of growing up gay than it is a chronicle of growing up a narcissist. There's really very little empathy here for the experience of others who've grown up gay and little reason to care about the author's experience.
3,Andrew Tobias is a poor model of what it means to be gay.,"What a shame the Chicago Tribune calls this ""Reid'shonest...story,"" when nothing could be furtherfrom the truth. Yes, when I was coming out, I read this book and thought, ""Hey, I am likethat too - a doctor, an Eagle Scout, a NavyLieutenant, etc."" As I continued to grow up, Idiscovered that Andrew Tobias, the closetedhomosexual who used the pseudonym ""John Reid"",had it all wrong. We don't do all those things sothe people we love will respect us when they findout we are gay. We do all those things because westill haven't learned how to love ourselves.Coming out is not about others accepting you, it'sabout accepting yourself. ""John Reid"" needs towrite a second volume, about Andrew Tobias."
3,Probably a good first book for teenagers.,"Andrew Tobias may have been the best little boy in the world, but he is certainly not the best writer in the world. This book is, however, humorously written, and is not sexually explicit, so that it would make a good ""primer"" on gay life. (At least I am supposing this, as I am not gay myself.) I believe there are far better books describing gay life, but this book does not intimidate as others might."
1,Self-loathing and superior,"The other readers pegged it nicely: this book is self-loathing and superior. I read this when I was fourteen and, fourteen years later, found myself rereading it when I cleaned out my closet. I can't believe the arrogance and myopia of its WASP narrator. This book is internalized homophobia coupled with upper middle class snobbery at its worst. No doubt if the author was born in Nazi Germany sixty years ago, he would be Hitler's right hand man in his pink triangle quest to oppress homosexuals, or at least, those too limp wristed and ""icky"" for Andrew Tobias' liking. I'm aghast other readers are recommending his book for those coming out of the closet."
2,Worked in the 70's ... but now??,"My 2nd reading, after nearly eighteen years. I'm not sure how this can be called a novel, as it is so obviously the autobiography of Mr. Tobias, under the pen name of John Reid. It is insightful concerning the thought patterns of small children who grow up knowing they are somehow different, but I found his intolerance for gay people in general, when that is what he is aspiring to, to be irritating and downright obnoxious. He is dreadfully afraid of being associated with anyone who doesn't fit his idea of the perfect gay man: collegiate, handsome, white."
3,"Yeah, It was Okay","I had heard so much about the book that I perhaps expected more than it was able to deliver. Nice book, but don't expect miracles of enlightenment."
3,Not as heavy duty as I expected and a small problem.,"The shrink tubing is much thinner and lighter than the kit I got with my deep well submersible pump. In addition it came with 1shrink wrap tube missing. Amazon sent me another one, so I lost some time but the new pack again had a tube missing. I took one tube from the new package and sent the rest back.It was not too bad but far from perfect."
3,Buen material,"producto de buena calidad lo recibí en el tiempo prometido, en buenas condiciones de un tamaño bastante bueno y practicas . !Lo recomiendo!"
5,Great gift set,"I gave my Dad this set for Christmas. I noticed how rusted and worn his tools are so I figured the basic pliers set would work. He likes them, uses them all the time. I went by and checked them for myself. Nice grip, they feel solid, the only difference from the photo ---the handle grips are all yellow, but he like that because it makes them easy to see on the work bench."
1,Unger dictionary,"Awesome book, easy to read!!!!! Big print and it was a gift to a friend and my friend loved it"
3,Buy It Only For The Pictures,"I may be a little more jaded than most, as I work in the Christmas biz, but I only recommend this work for the beautiful photos. The text is mostly the same old trite, oft heard Radko propaganda and marketing BS.....If you want a picture book to flip through and get you ramped up for Christmas, this will well fill the bill....If you are a serious Christmas collector/businessman, ignore much of the text, as it will only insult you....""The man who single handidly saved the blown glass ornament from extinction""? Oh, please...."
1,Style Over Substance,"Mediocre vocalist who disguises her shortcomings by working with very talented producers who multi-layer and process her thin vocals. This is a perfect example of style over substance.On the positive side...if you're looking for something to work out to rather than listen to, this CD would probably be perfect for you."
3,Could've Been Much Better.,"This remix album could've been much better do to the fact that most of these remixes were released on the 12"" singles. It is good though because most of the singles were on record and you could own it on CD. My advice just buy Forever Your Girl or the Greatest Hits. This is for the serious Paula Fan only!"
3,I forgot that I had this one in my collection...,'Must be an obvious indictment against repeated listening!'Good thing that she's a dancer!
3,SHUT UP!,Its cool. But don not compare anyone to Madonna Mr.Guatemala. You can dance is O.G the first ever remix album. And is almost double platinum at 1.7 million BABY...... in the US./././.paula who ??????????????
3,Dance Remixes,"the remix cd is okay, i like it but lacks something not sure what it is but seems a bit repetitious, but for an abdul fan you can just shut up and dance, overall a good danceable cd."
3,"Some good points, but not as helpful as it could be","Unfortunately the author is somewhat enamored of his own part in the story without taking into consideration the needs of the reader. There is a lot missing--perhaps classified?--that would make the purposes and principles of remote viewing understandable to the ordinary person. The personal narratives of people experimenting with it are not dynamic or enthralling enough to wade through. I ended up with a sense that the author is convinced, but that's not the same as being convinced myself."
5,Scientific and Spiritual,"F. Holmes ""Skip"" Atwater began the remote-viewing military program that is known as STARGATE. His book, ""Captain of My Ship, Master of My Soul"" is a really interesting combination of autobiography, remote-viewing training manual, his involvement with Bob Monroe and the Monroe Institute and a presentation of his spiritual belief system based on his out of body experiences.If you want some detailed instructions on how to do remote-viewing or are just interested in Atwater's spiritual out of body experiences, this book is a must read. I highly recommend it."
5,"A deeply thought-provoking, metaphysical book","Captain Of My Ship, Master Of My Soul: Living With Guidance is the book and CD-ROM memoir of the truly remarkable author F. Holmes Atwater, whose life and military career as a clairvoyant counterspy led to the inception of a singular remote-viewing surveillance program. The CD-ROM that comes with this 226 page, trade paper book contains four declassified and redacted documents, as well as audio recordings and transcripts of his spiritual journeys beyond the limits of the physical body. Captain Of My Ship, Master Of My Soul is a deeply thought-provoking, metaphysical book about the voyages of consciousness and the inexplicable forces that govern human life."
1,Bill Simon's autobiography,"A Time for Reflection is most interesting if ou have read ""A Time For Truth"".A picture of the author obtained in Reflection in this case reinforced theimportance of the prior book, Time for Truth. i.e. The value of Constitutional Freedoms are illustrated in economic as well as moral values.For me ""Time For Truth"" made clear the lack of understanding most government employees have of the impact of their decisions.For me three Stars"
1,Incomplete,The Kindle edition is not the full text of John Masefield's narrative poem 'The Everlasting Mercy' but only about the first 1/3. Needless to say this is very frustrating and annoying. You should be able to download a full text somewhere else. Do that instead. A shame as this poem is very moving and a personal favourite.
3,Fair,"A mixed bag of material on this disc, which is pleasant without ever really being truly memorable."
5,Excellent.,"As advertised. Easy installation, read the directions first, though. Look great on my Rav 4, well designed, really nice on a cool rainy day!"
5,WeatherTeck is Good,"Easy install. But, be careful when bending to insert, it can crack. Product looks good and deflects wind and rain. Allows air to come in without blasting. I like it. Packaging was very good."
4,Useful,"Used for a college ministry retreat to paint on plastic. While this took some effort it did work. We didn't expect our ""creations"" to last and they didn't as the paint flaked off after it dried."
3,Cute but very small puzzle pieces,"My 5 year old loves care bears and is just starting to do 50+ piece puzzles (w/ assistance) so I decided to order this along with some Christmas gifts. It is very cute and the tin is very nice but it's very small. The tin is approximately 6"" by 4"" and the puzzle pieces are the size (or maybe even smaller) then the typical adult puzzle. I've done the puzzle with my daughter but the pieces are really too small for her to put together. However, she loves to use the tin to put small things in it so the tin has been used a lot :-)"
2,Typical of Elizabeth Bowen,"I love Elizabeth Bowen but as with every other book I've ever read of hers, the ending always leaves my hanging. Yes, I can use my imagination and guess what's going to happen after the book ends but how much more magical to have it put in her words. I love everything about her books except the endings. She's no longer on my ""must read"" authors list."
4,Fred Said Right,"It's weird to review a tribute record when: A) you're previously unfamilar with the artist being tributed (if that's a word); B) you're not a fan of its primary musical genre; and C) you're a neighbor of the producer.Having said that, buy this.There's folk, rock & roll, and lotsa country (authentic country, not Toby/Dixie country). There's funny, sad and enigmatic (it turns out Fred's quite the storyteller; lyrics are included). There's a dead dog, an abandoned gas station, and actual Canadians who never mention hockey - something for everyone!.Personal faves? Gurf, OFB, and Old No. 8.But be warned: this is a gateway record - you may be on your way to the orginal Eaglesmith recordings and/or other records by the Various Artists involved. Congratulations are in order - to the musicians, Mike Holm, Mr. E. of course, and to you.::"
1,Poor workmanship,This wallet is beautiful to look at but it frayed immediately upon putting credit cards into slot.
3,Good for the beginner,"Mr. Burdick has done a fine job with this introductory level commentary. He makes good cases for the arguments concerning the Gnostic heresy, and his comments on love in the church are well said.This is not the book I thought I was getting when I ordered it, as there is another much more extensive commentary by Burdick on these epistles, and I would recomend that one for more in-depth study.My only other issue is his stance on perpetual forgiveness of past-present-future sins, he doesn't even bother to back up why he believes in future forgivness on a past repentance, he just states it and expects you to accept it. Which sort of contradicts his interpretation on needing to be continually forgiven. So does he believe in Once Saved Always Saved or not?Other than that, this commentary is pretty good, especially if you like William Barclay's style and approach to commentaries."
3,"hmmm, well i didn't buy this book","I didn't buy this book but I've read it beforeIt's a cover of luke holding a light saber , wasn't sure whether it's a combo of all volumes from the trilogy, or just this volume...Well yeah it's about the heir of the emperor looking for the glove of darth vadar and yada yada...go buy the book if u want to know.i would say it's mediocre...no large scale battles or military conflicts, basically just stories between the characters...i still think that George Lucas' Starwars Trilogy are the best...Zahn's trilogy is too archetypical, nothing really special about it...it's fun to read since it's been authorized as the official continuation of the starwars trilogy by george lucas"
1,What?! A book?!,"Maybe I'm jaded by having read so many other far superior books documenting information about alleged UFO crashes, sightings, abductions, etc., but DARK OBJECT read more like an overlong pamphlet than it did a book. The authors attempt at research is basically reduced to a series of telephone conversations, eyewitness interviews, and newspaper clipping summaries that add up to nothing. In the final chapter, they make the allegation that not only was one saucer downed, but there were two! It read like bad fiction, more than a hard core examination of what evidence was available. The cover speaks of officials denying the events contained within, but the authors didn't discuss anyone who denied anything! They just didn't want to talk about it. Go reread ALIEN AGENDA."
4,First-rate UFO documentary!,"As a UFO Investigator, this particular book was an eye-opener both for its merits as a suspenseful documentary as well as a report full of factual information. The authors have showcased in a persuasive and comprehensive way the lesser-known case of this Nova Scotia sighting.For UFO debunkers, it is tough to refute evidence in the midst of several highly-reputable witnesses as well as fishermen who are used to seeing objects (ships, boats, rafts, etc.) in the water. Another government cover-up!"
4,Not as bad as is made out,"Ok so I know it's a little on the thin side but it's an introduction to an interesting topic. You may well look beyond this book for a more in depth analysis of the Shag Harbour incident but, if like me, you're happy with a more generalized account then this is a book worth reading.It won't take the next 6 weeks to read but will give you a flavor of what (allegedly)happened."
4,Married at Midnight,"The book arrived on time in good condition. I mainly bought the book because my favorite author, Kathleen Woodiwiss had a short story in there."
5,married at midnight,"It was a good book...I had read the other books in this series and wanted to finish all of them...I feel bad that I had to buy the book, but there wasn't any other option...I would have like to have read it from the library or on an ebook, but not available...I did what I needed to do..."
4,No problems,"No problems. Book arrived in good time. Book had slight imperfection with the cover having a slight tear halfway down. Otherwise, everything was fine."
5,A Masterpiece from the Leading thinker for all corporate accountants,"My copy of Reinventing the CFO has over 30 stickers in the pages where I have discovered a Jeremy Hope Gem. He is without any doubt the leading thinker in the world for all corporate accountants. He was the first person to finally put a nail in the coffin of the annual planning process through his masterpiece book, ""beyond budgeting"". Every CFO should own ""Reinventing the CFO"" on their bookshelf and refer to it frequently, as I do."
5,Enthralling!,"I first read this book in 1991 and am still haunted by some of the words and letters of Alice James. Jean Srouse's thorough research and great prose kept me reading. It was Alice, herself, however who really touched me. This book introduced me to a cast of interesting characters who are with me still."
1,What Happened ?????,"I was a huge Verve fan since they came out in the early 90s. The first two Richard Ashcroft solo albums were disappointing compared to the early Verve albums. I heard the first single, Break the Night with Color, from this new album, and thought maybe he's back doing some halfway decent tunes. But man, I got the album today, there are 3 or 4 good songs on it, and they aren't even that great. The rest of the album sounds like what if Richard Ashcroft did an album with Sheryl Crow. What happened? I think he's cowriting the album lyrics with the writers who do Hallmark Cards."
2,FORCED EFFORT,"This album sounds forced with no inspiration and or feeling. Sorry Rich, back to the drawing board. Listen to ""Alone With Everybody"" again."
1,Shame,"Is that a picture of Ashcroft with his head hung in shame on the cover?If not, he should.Unlistenable, painfully mediocre, plodding, going through the motions. The fall from grace couldn't have been further."
3,How do the Yanamamo see Chagnon?,"Chagnon's book is one of the most widely read ethnographies of tribal and animistic people. In it you read how Chagnon sees the Yanamamo. If you want to read how the Yanamamo see Chagnon and other 'nabas' read ""Spirit of the Rainforest"" by Mark Andrew Ritchie. It is written from the perspective of a Yanamamo shaman. You will discover things not covered in Chagnon's work."
2,"""The Hollow""...yeah...the legend turns into a teen flick...","hum...at a high school, there is going to be a hay ride to celebrate the legend of Sleepy Hollow. Suddenly, the headless horseman picks off the teenagers one by one until he is defeated. Ian is a relative of Ichabod Crane. Erica is one dirty little girl just to get what she wants. Karen is rather self-reserved staying on the safe side. Nick Carter plays the jock who is the prankster and joker.It's an okay movie. It does have a 'Scream' attempt - and I really mean it. It's a teen slasher, but it doesn't do that well in the blood/gore department, but there is a scene where Erica is doing it with her friend. Another Friday the 13th formula where you do it and you die. I was suprised when I saw it on ABC Family. The DVD itself...it lacks. It has a few trailers...scene selection...nothing special.Okay movie. Watch it."
2,Disappointing........,"The Hollow seemed like it would be a great horror movie but in my opinion,it wasn't. The legend of sleepy hollow is brought back to us in this low budget redention of the classic. A couple of good scenes but overall, it could have been so much better. Poorly shot and just not a good horror movie. I was let down."
5,Extremely Great......,"Okay, this wasn't too bad for a direct to video release. The story was pretty good. Basically, this is about a dective and a doctor who must team up to stop a rouge soldier. Who is bent on getting revenge for what happened to him. When he took part in a experiment, that left him invisble. Check it out, it's a great movie!!!!"
4,Not Bad,"Ppl are reviewing this movie as if it were a major motion picture. This was intended and is just a campy little film. Yes the acting is bad and the story silly but so what it's fun. All of the acting is really bad including the vetern actors such as Stacy Keach, Judge Reinhold, Eileen Brennan and Joe Mazzello. I think the over acting and campy acting was intentional making it quite the fun little movie. Nick Carter didn't do bad at all considering this was his first movie actually he did about as good as the other young actors in the movie. Keep your perspective about you and realize you are watching a silly little movie grab some popcorn and enjoy it."
2,HOLLOW INDEED,"Waiting six years to do a sequel to the more engrossing original, this followup doesn't really seem necessary. Confusing plot developments, standard effects and mediocre acting combine for a rather tedious thriller. Christian Slater is going to become the next Stephen Baldwin with his laconic, devil may care and lifeless acting. Peter Facinelli and Laura Regan try a little harder, but they're swamped in the script's ineptitude. Maybe it'll be nice to say we haven't seen Christian Slater for a while!"
4,The Hollow review,This movie could have been better but I have watched it a number of times and will watch it again! The young actors need more experience but all have potental. The seasoned actors needed more screen time. All in all it was good. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate it a 7.5
2,hollow man 2 is indeed that-HOLLOW,"there are many reasons to rip apart this movie, there are enough holes that even NEW YORK rats could go through. however, what this movie lacks, it makes up for with a nice presentation, bonus features and really good special effects. the story is slim-unstable serum. there is govermental paranoia, rediculous chases, cheese nudity, a slight look of HALLOWEEN(from the persons POV)--sort of DARKMAN look and feel to the actors in their roles, several nice killings and the typical no brainer ending(SEQUEL) hmmn?, the movie company was lucky it was filming on a dark dreary rainy days!!-lol. movie is not bad. its better than most if you want to be entertained. just try not to get too involved. RENT IT."
3,Good Sequel,"Overall #2 is not in the same league as the first. It's obvious that the resources in producing this film were less significant than the first thus reflecting on the total quality of the film. However, if you liked the first Hollow Man, you will appreciate this one for its continuation of the storyline, the first-rate acting and decent production."
5,Heads off to this one,"Great movie.This move was sent and received with no delay.Excellent service and in perfect condition.Thanks,N"
5,Awsome!!! As my daughters would say...,"My daughters and I saw the movie when it came out on ABCFamily a few years ago. We loved it then and we love it now. Everything about this movie was ""awsome"" as the girls would say. Money well spent."
1,Great Product - Awful Tech Support,"If you are thinking of buying this product to utilise your Mac as a PC as well, then you are on the right track. However, if like me you have a few peripherals, some development tools, etc. there will come a time when you will need tech support. That's when you hit a brick wall.You have a better chance of emailing your gold fish and getting a response than from someone at Connectix. I mean that most sincerely. Weeks. Absolutely weeks go by before someone will wake up to the fact that you have written in and respond to you. Then they will ask you for more information. Then you will respond and then another month or two will go by.Think hard before you make this purchase if this is the kind of company you want to deal with. Because you are going to be facing many, many lonely weeks waiting for their response, if it ever comes."
4,RIP Bionic Brown,Saw Bionik Brown live a few years ago. Wondered what happened to him and found out he was killed in a car crash back in 2008. Very talented musician and when I met him at the live show he was very nice. R.I.P. Bionik Brown.
5,mystical realism,"I believe this is by the same director of Strawberry and Chocolate and Guantanamero....All of the movies demonstrate the beauty of the Cuban people, and the desperation and creativity that they possess. I had the the fortune of going there with my boyfriend this past year and spending some time in a busstop....all of the above movies really resonated after my trip. The people have been waiting for a long time....and it's time for them to prosper"
5,JUST FOR THE DORMS,I've always loved MAD Magazine. This is perfect for the student in class. I could have made a fortune selling these at my high school. If only I had a time machine.
2,Love Johns Hate the Book,"The deeper I got into this book, the more I disliked it. It is an invasion of privacy...of a person who has decided to try and remain as private and secluded as he can be (which, by the way, is his right to do). I did read with interest as she helped to unravel the complexity behind his paintings, but did not find any interest in her exploration of his deeply personal life. Besides, the author has a tendency to rant and ramble for whole chapters at a time, which I found tedious to say the least. I gave the book 2 stars because I did learn a few things about Johns. But I can't really recommend the book to anyone."
2,A disappointment!,"I am disappointed in the organization of the information. It seems to ""run on and on"". She needs an editor -- also someone with the scientific background to add credibility.Prior to purchase, I had thought she was a dietitian (note spelling), but her consistent misspelling of the word proves she is not. No ideas for those who do not like white flour, pasta, eggplant, squash. My gout-sufferer was very depressed in reading it.I was glad to see the inclusion of tart cherry juice for gout management."
2,Gout not,Save yourself some money and search the net for free information and recipes before you buy this book. Her advice and suggestions are free on the net. Her recipes are nothing to write home about either.
4,Book Review,THe information about gout is accurate and concise including the diet data. The recipe information is skimply but the book is a must for people with gout.
5,Very Helpful,"I bought Gout Hater's Cookbook I for my father, who suffers from Gout. He liked the recipes and the information so much I also bought Gout Hater's II and III. He has thanked me many times for this very helpful resource."
5,High Marks,"Teen years aren't what they used to be. Now kids contend with cliques, drugs, alcohol, peer pressure - all on a scale we never had to. QUEEN BEES AND WANNABES is an eye openning book. It's as eye openning as the first time I read MY FRACTURED LIFE and WHAT IT TAKES TO PULL ME THROUGH. Well recommeded to read the three in tandum for a full insight into the here and now of the pressures and temptations facing kids today."
2,Marketing Collateral,"So I bought the book in hopes of learning something about my 13-year-old daughter. What I found was the author's attempt to sell her program: ""Empower."" I would have been better served if she were more focused. I felt the book strayed--there was lots roll-playing which I believed to be a distraction. At this point I'm on the hunt for a book that will really be of benefit to me, my daughter, our relationship and her roll in her social circle."
2,These girls aren't necessarily the norm,"I know girls like the ones in the book exist, but to assume your daughter will fall into one of the catagories is presumptious. Before reading the book I always saw my 14 year od daughter as a ""floater"", having a wide variety of friends in a wide variety of groups (music, sports, academics). The same could be said of many of her closer friends. When I read the descriptions of types of girls, she immediately recognized herself as a floater, but her reaction to the ""queen bee"" and the supporting group mentality was ""who has time to be concerned about that stuff? Those people really need to get a life."" In high school the catagories seem even less important."
4,Open Your Eyes,This book will scare you only if you are not aware of what all goes on with girls in this day and age. I'm one of those mothers. It's a good book. Read it. Live it. You never know what's going to happen.
1,Do we really need Roz Wiseman?,"From the very beginning of this book I found myself questionning Ms. Wiseman's credibility. If ""all girls lie"" what makes her think the ones in this book have shared their deepest truest feelings with her, a total stranger? Any sociologist knows most teens (and many non-teens) tend to tell a willing listener exactly what they think they'd like to hear.As I turned the pages I became more convinced this writer needs to rewrite Queen Bees after she has a teenaged daughter of her own--their stories aren't ""boring,"" nor do they require special expertise to sit through! I'm thankful my girls share them, and even enjoy hearing them! By the time Ms. Wiseman was advising me on how to know if my daughter had a party while I was away (are we moms really that dense?) I regretted purchasing this book.Live with a teen 24/7 and maybe then you'll get what they're REALLY all about."
5,Every parent with a daughter needs this book,"Wow, if you are female this book will take you back in time and make you more compassionate towards your daugher. If you are a dad - you need to read this to realize what your daugher is going through. It is a quick read. I think my daughter apprecaites that I am reading this book. By the way it was suggested by her Dr. that I read it."
2,yikes,"This book is about how to talk to your daughters about things. The author gives horrible ways for you to sit down and talk. Ok and the situations don't happen in middle school or high school that happen in the book. Wiseman went to my cousins school for like 2 months and took the worst events and made them sound worse then they were. Now they are making a movie called ""Mean Girls."" The things the author tells is not at all helpful."
1,Wrongheaded and Stupid,"To think that my little girl because she is a girl would have an aggresive bone in her body is the dumbest idea that I have ever heard. Little girls are made from suger and spice and everthing nice and it is the boys that cause all the trouble. I am upset, ticked off at the notion that it is the other way around. The fate of the world rests with proper notions being taught about who we are and what we do and this book does not do that. Sad!"
3,Overall: ok...,"I felt that this book was just ok. It was well written, and I can see how it would benefit a parent of a teen. However, I am a teen, and I feel that some of the book was a little too dramatic and harsh on teens. There are some dramatizations of situations which were somewhat unrealistic. Besides this, I feel that it was an interesting read."
2,Depressing....,"This book while telling you all about what ""some"" girls and a little about what boys go through, it tells you that ""THAT"" is the way things are in middle school and in high school for our kids. If this book was required for parents to read before their kids enter middle school, I'm telling you ""NOBODY"" would sign their kids up for school anymore... What for? Just to go through the ""required"" stage of life?So, what the author is saying is that your girl has to be humiliated, excluded, ignored and left out trying to survive school so she can be assertive, self assure, self confident, and emphatic person when she grows up! GIVE ME A BREAK!"
5,"If you liked ""Mean Girls,"" you'll like this book","This is the book that the movie ""Mean Girls"" was based on. It takes an incredible journey into the minds of teenaged girls and exposes the realities of what adolescence is like for many of today's girls. A must-read for parents or soon-to-be parents of adolescent girls who want to get a head start on what to expect and how to prepare them for the inevitable consequences of their and their friends and so-called friends decisions."
3,Queenbees and Wannabees,"Delivery as expected. Content of this book is useful for people with young daughters...starting at 10-11 years old! This particular book was used, however it was marked up more than I would have liked or expected. Overall...very good."
3,Nothing for the girl on the outside,"I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews, but it didn't cover my daughter's problem. What about the girl who isn't a part of any clique? The one that other girls call wierd or strange because she doesn't dress like they do, or has achne, or whatever else they decide is not like them. Surely some of those hundreds of girls she talked to had this problem. So, why the exclusion... yet again???"
4,A real eye-opener!,"Pros: An excellent insight into the world of young adolescence. This book really opened my eyes into what is going on in the mind of my daughter and her peers, and what the social scene will be for her as she enters middle school. We have already had several very good conversations about how to deal with mean girls, developing, fashion pressures, etc. The comments of real teens quoted throughout are very insightful. This book will help us get through the next few years.Cons: I think that the author jumps around too much. The book could be organized better. If you read the entire thing, you won't miss anything, but it will be difficult to find certain portions if you want to go back to them later."
2,Not culturally sensitive,"This book is great if you come from WHITE AMERICA! I am sorry but I think we need authors who write books such as this to research more on other cultures rather than white suburban cities. Each culture is different when I comes to cliques, gossip and bullying in schools. It will be hard for me to apply this to my school since I am a counselor in a Native American community."
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting a sociological book on teens. What you get was a manual of how to raise teen girls. Not what I was hoping for.
2,Disappointed,Just not that impressed with this book. The write-up was much better than the book itself. Superficial. Will be selling my copy as used.
3,Beginner Book,"This book notes at the beginning that it is intended for amateurs with no knowledge of theory, and is not intended to equip the user to play professionally. As long as readers/buyers keep this point in mind, they should be happy with their purchase. I already knew how to construct major, minor, diminished, augmented, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 13 chords built on thirds, so this book did not advance my knowledge very much. However it did contain some good pointers about where chord voicings can be used most effectively on the keyboard.If you need a working knowledge of basic-to-intermediate chord voicings on the keyboard, this book is not a bad place to start. If you want to develop the knowledge and skills to play jazz gigs, don't bother. Better starting points for that would be books likeSolo Jazz Piano: The Linear ApproachorThe Jazz Piano Book."
1,No Problems Solved,"The major problem that I need to have solved is how long I'll have to work to replace the money I wasted on this ""CD"". This is a total waste of money and has no usable information to help 'problem solve' in any form of tracking be it Schutzhund, Search and Rescue, or regular Man-trailing/Tracking. I also had in my mind that my ""CD"" was more of a 'DVD' not a word document that someone typed in about 10 minutes.This was a complete let-down. I tried to find something usable here to help problem solve my GSD tracking problems....but there are no solutions here..."
3,WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO BE LOVED BY TWO MEN?,"I READ THIS BOOK AWHILE BACK AND THE REASON I GIVE THIS BOOK ONLY 3 STARS IS BECAUSE I DONT REMEMBER MUCH OF IT. MOST OF THE BOOKS I READ ARE SO GOOD THAT I REMEMBER THE MAIN PARTS, LIKE WHY KATHLEEN LEFT ERIK. FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CAN'T REMEMBER. I ALSO DID NOT LIKE THE FACT KATHLEEN WAS CHEATING ON SETH. ALL SETH DID WAS LOVE HER AND TREAT HER WITH RESPECT. ERIK IS OF COURSE A MAN THAT GETS WHAT HE WANTS, INCLUDING THE MARRIED WOMAN.THE THING THAT I LIKE WAS THE ENDING. SETH WAS SO LOVING THAT HE HELPED KATHLEEN AND ERIK REUNITE THE LOVE THEY HAD FOR EACH OTHER."
4,Read over 30 Sandra Brown Books...,"This one was one of her shorter, sweeter, yet predictable books where the two protagonists meet at a summer camp, fall in love and live happily ever after. Although it was predictable, you cannot resist the tension between the two, as well as the realist dialogue and setting. This book is highly recommended. In fact, I read it twice!"
5,This book will change your life,"Given today's glut of ""new age gurus,"" it's comforting to find a wise soul like Easwaran. In completely unpretentious, lucid, and humorous prose he describes how meditation and its allied principles will instantly transform your life. MEDITATION does not promise overnight change. Easwaran, rather, says in blunt terms that it's hard work to meditate on the scriptures each morning, put others first, and give one-pointed attention to every detail of our life. The difficulty lies in the fact that these principles go against our conditioning. But I and many other faithful individuals will ensure that this book will dramatically change your life if you give it the chance. To paraphrase the Buddha, Don't go by blind faith, try it out yourself and see if it works. I assure you the journey will be prosperous."
5,8 steps to transformation,"This book was really well written. I've searched and tried various forms of meditation and I think this book explains a very effective method for personal transformation. The method of passage meditation that the author recommends is simple and practical. He also covers 7 other points which are supposed to help aid in deepening meditation. Each point is a chapter. Some of these points such as one-pointed attention, putting others first, and slowing down are very contrary to today's culture. I found these suggestions for swimming against modern day culture refreshing. For someone coming from a catholic background I also appreciated that author has fashioned a program free of dogma and ritual. This is something I can practice within my own religious background."
1,Do not buy from here.,Worst experience. I paid for this then they did not ship it when they said they would. My class started still no shipping. I emailed them several times and no answer. So I had fill out a cancel request and rented a copy for more money but received it quick. Then four days later I get an email saying they just shipped the book. Awful. Don't go with them
4,This Myth Book is a bit hard to understand,"I think when I bought this I got in over my head. This is a serious academic work, like something that a graduate student might write for a thesis. I spend many hours going over the easier parts that I liked though. No fluff here. Serious readers."
3,Daevid Allen - 'Art Radio: Radio Brainwave 1984' (Bananamoon Obscura),"Eleven tracks of more or less 'cutting floor' material, audio collages, etc. 'Art Radio' was notably one of twelve radio broadcasts on the 2NCR Radio Lismoe station in Australia, winter 1984. Some of the tunes here I thought were decent include ""Listen Matey"", the definitely obscure twelve-minute ""Radio Brainwave"", the ten-minute ""Art Radio"" and ""Punk Ironix"". No. 14 in the Bananamoon Obscura - Daevid Allen series. perhaps my least favorite of the lot, but still an okay pick."
2,Bad translation of great work,"Chaucer's Canterbury Tales are a wonderful collection of stories which I highly recommend. This translation, however, takes liberties. Nicholson embellishes Chaucer's work, which does not need such additions, and changes words to fit his sentiment rather than keeping with the meaning of Chaucer's original. Examples:Chaucer: Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote ...Nicholson: When April with his showers sweet with fruit ...Chaucer: To Caunterbury with full devout corage, ...Nicholson: To Canterbury, full of devout homage, ...Corage means heart or spirit, NOT homage.I recommend an interlinear translation, it keeps the translators honest, and allows you to see where they have deviated from the original."
3,Ok but not great,"The clip, after a while once you put bbs in they fly right out, and you can still cock it when the gun is on safe.Soon the trigger will get wobble but it does not effect its shooting.Pros: it's small, good for a beginner,Cons: close range, week, mest up clip, and cheap safety and trigger."
3,Ehh,"Im not saying its good and im not saying its bad its just that even though its fun to just play around with it doesnt feel realistic what so ever. With its weigt of .26 lb and its plasticy feel to it, it kimd of feels some what like a water gun actually. But even though the physical appearence of this gun is so so the fps is alright for a neat little gun. I would recomend this for begginers and begginers only!"
1,colt 25 positives and negatives,"if you get this gun do not cock the gun really fast, mine broke within the first 3 days.The accuracy is bad, even in the lowest wind the BB's drift up. If you are into having wars i would not recommend this gun.The good thing is for a small gun it hold 15 BB's and is very small so you can hide it in your pocket. Tere is also no way to take the gun apart, if it gets jammed you can only take of the top witch does not do you any good."
1,"cheap,not worth the money!","Very cheap plastic junk, don't waste your money, was totally disappointed, should have cost $2.00 , never buy again, what a waste!!"
1,your dumb if u by this for 13 $,"First of all dont by this alone ok so im at walmart going there to get more bb's and i found a 10,000 pack of .12 bb's and it literially came with this gun and 10,000 bb's for 10 dollars so go to walmart and get the gun wit the bb's their might not be any left because i kno i bought every one their haha but just dont 15 for this 5$ gun"
2,Disappointed,"With all the positive reviews this gun gets, I'm not sure if I just happened to get a lemon, or what. The problem I encountered was with both magazines. Every time I tried to load the gun, after the fourth or fifth one, the pellets just sprayed everywhere. Cheap spring? Some other fault in the design? I really can't say, being new to airsoft. My advice would be to purchase this gun in person so that if it has the same problems mine had, you don't need to go through all the hassle of shipping it back or dealing with a warranty department somewhere in East Asia."
1,Colt 25 airsoft is junk,"I have the same problem as a previous reviewer. Pellets are spraying everywhere and if I do manage to get pellets in the magazine, one cock unloads all the pellets into the chamber at once. This pellet gun is a piece of junk. Unless you like wasting your time and money, don't buy from this company. As, I'm not the only person writing about this issue, you can imagine thousands of others have encountered the problem and Soft Air USA just doesn't care. This pellet gun is fit for the trash. Thankfully, I purchased this crap in-store and can get a refund tomorrow."
1,Don't even bother....,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. First of all, I like games that make you think. This game is completely predictable. If you don't figure out something right away--you won't have to worry. Your cursor will figure it out for you. There are only a few logic puzzles, and even those are too easy. And if you like visiting the same locations over and over in a game, then this one's for you. I give it a 1 out of 10."
2,What the...?,"The game has an interesting story, and the setup as a writer who is on the ripper's trail is pretty good.However, the game's technology is outdated, and its implementation overly buggy. Also, the gameplay itself is extremely dull. But I played through it all because the whole ""Jack the Ripper"" story kinda intrigues me anyway. Now I do not want to spoil the game for you by telling you the ending, but really, there simply isn't much to spoil. It was not worth it at all.This is one of those games with a real story. It makes you wish that there were more games with a story like this. But then you realize how bad this is actually implemented and you kinda lose hope for the whole genre...If I were you, I'd steer clear."
2,Doesn't Flow Very Well,"I bought this game because I wanted to play a game that was intriguing and mysterious. Well, it turns out that this game is frustrating at best, because of its linear play. This game doesn't allow the player to do anything out of order, which results in time-consuming wandering back and forth between locations, or praying that something different happens the 100th time you visit a location. I found myself very frustrated with the narrowness of this game, and don't recommend it to anyone. The only reason why it gets 2 stars is because of the environment is very realistic, and one gets a good feel for early 1900's life, as well as the fact that the music and acting are actually done quite well. However, some sound bites cut off right in the middle of a sentence, which has the player wondering what was said. Finally, there are misspelled words and factual errors, such as the World Series in 1901. This game isn't very good."
4,jack the ripper,"The game is simple with-let's say-logical puzzles.Don't expect anything fancy from grafics.Concider how old the game is.From the other hand,my opinion is that the game has good scenario and i believe that you will enjoy it."
3,"Fun, but wish I'd bought it used","I enjoyed this game while I was playing it, even though it does constrict your movements some, as has been mentioned in other reviews. I thought the graphics were good, and had no problem playing it on a 2 yr old laptop (didn't need to upgrade anything.) My 11 yr old daughter sat next to me most of the time I played, and she enjoyed watching it (and it wasn't too graphic for her.) We both have the same complaint, though... the ending was lame, and came too soon (after only 12 days, game time.)I bought this brand-new less than a week ago and am now ready to sell it, because it is not one to play over and over again, discovering new things each time. It was fun to play, once, and because of that I wish I'd bought it used!"
3,An OK Game,"I think this game is just OK. I don't think it's as bad as everyone is saying it is. I love adventure games, even though I am not that good at them. I usually end up looking at walkthroughs like 10 times in one game. But this game was so easy, I didn't have to look once. There's only like 3 puzzles. The Nancy Drew games for younger girls are even much more complicated. The graphics were kind of outdated. The game was short. I did like the story, the bad ending doesn't matter that much to me. I'm in it more for the gameplay, which was good. There are lots of places to go, and lots of characters to interact with. It was more like an interactive movie than a real hard adventure game."
4,This game was pretty good,"This game was pretty good, there was one gorey part, not that scary. I did like the music for it though. I liked the ending song that Abigail sings. It is a little bit of a dark game and sometimes it is hard to see what you are doing. Very exciting though. I liked the game overall."
1,"It Never Worked! I Was ""Jacked""!","Why did I waste my hard-earned shekels on this ca-ca from Adventure Gaming? I have a state-of-the-art Gateway desktop but the game always locked up tighter than a frog's sphincter at the menu screen. I had to unplug my main power cord to break the stranglehold on my computer every time I tried to click on 'New Game!' Their Technical Service had me jump through numerous hoops (install new drivers for my cutting-edge Nvidia graphics board, uninstall/reinstall, shut off programs during install, etc. etc. blah, blah, blah). Nothing worked. Save your money and in my humble opinion be wary of Adventure Gaming's future offerings. You've been duly warned."
5,You saved the day!,"Our daughter is getting married this summer and as part of the decorations we needed lights on white cords. We started checking every store in town WEEKS before Christmas...NO LUCK! Not one store had any strings of lights, only net lights or swag! I am so glad I decided to check Amazon.com for lights. They were cheaper than any store would have been and I got them fairly quick. That's one less thing I have to worry about for the wedding! Whew!"
5,More than we expected!,"We purchased this book to get ideas for fun and educational things to do with our 2 year old twins. In addition to finding a number of activities to engage our children, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the first few chapters of the book covered developmental and behavioral issues. The book is well organized into categories of play that reflect the natural interests of a toddler. The author is educated in child development and seems to have deep experience with the ins and outs of toddler play. Great book."
1,No what I had expected,I expected more crafty and fun things to be included in this book than there were. The book provided explanation in why children enjoy doing certain things but a lot of the ideas are common things that we already do (blowing bubbles and playing in water). Overall I was just very disappointed in the book.
2,Problem with this listing,"These samples are seriously scrambled and are rather unhelpful in allowing one to decide whether to purchase this cd. For one thing, all selections are attributed to JS Bach, but there are several composers whose music is actually in this lineup."
3,"Lots of info on what to do, but its outdated fast.","I bought this hopping to be able to start my own internet business. I gave up with out being able to. The internet moves at such a fast pace, this book was outdated when I got it. All though it does have some good reference material. With this book alone I could not make my own internt Business (or blog for money). Still worth having for the reference materials though."
4,It's okay,"It's a great product. However, because it's so thick, I found myself lazy to open this book so as the results I have bought other books that are thinner and easier to read."
1,Don't be a dummie,"This is useful in that it explains alot of online jargon, but as a required reading assignment, it didn't peak my interest."
4,An effective approach to improved writing instruction,"The author's claim here is that delivery, or verbalizing text, has been wrongfully excluded from writing instruction in specific, English education in general. She proposes to explain its significance and outline the benefits of reincorporating it into the curriculum. ""Through performance, students physically share their concepts with their peers"", she says, and ""speech requires that the orator consider others, their uniqueness and variety, in the communication act"". This is sound theory and an effective bridge to creating the authentic audiences that good writing (as defined by Moffett and Smith) requires."
1,disappointing and unrealistic,"My title for this review pretty much says it all. The synopsis on the back cover that makes it sound so intriguing is just plain deceiving, in my humble opinion. What mature woman in her right mind would wait until the very last second to leave her home that is in the direct path of a fast moving inferno? The poetry is okay; the rest of it is just plain stupid. I cannot see any value in the far-fetched scenarios in this book and am sorry that I wasted my time and money."
2,Disappointing ending...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of this book but found it rather tedious somewhere in the middle after the ""mysterious"" character showed up. I got a little impatient with a lot of the characters and found the repartee between the hero and his friends tiresome. Also thought the heroine was a little over the top. In a nutshell, I was very disappointed when I got to the end of the book..."
1,Waaaaaaaaaaaaay over priced,This item is not worth the price as it is only 2 lbs. worth of candy. You can get a 4 lb bag at Walmart for less than $9.00 and afford to throw away the flavors you don't like. This item would be worth 5 or 6 bucks.
4,it's all there,"lots of green jolly ranchers. we got what was expected.the box was damaged a little, but that's no biggie."
3,Mmm Jolly Ranchers...,Okay so I got this for my mom who loves the green ones and doesn't like getting the mixed bag and having to sort out the blue ones which she hates. We got this and found out its actually cheaper to get the mixed bag instead of this. Other then that it apparently tasted good and there were no other problems it also arrived on time.
2,opened package.,Ordered two boxes of Jolly Rancher candy. One box was opened. I should have sent the entired order back. I will never order candy online again.
5,They are Apple Jolly Ranchers...,What else do you want to know? Can't find them locally by themselves. I prefer the apple and the watermelon so I buy these direct and keep them on my desk and work. Better than eating candy bars.
4,Good introductory text,"This book dives into the basic concepts of client/server computing and does it in a way that the average person can quickly grasp what it's about. While it may not be a ""techie"" book, it is an entertaining and intriguing look at this technology, which is becoming an increasingly popular one.I liked the author's use of analogies to introduce specific subjects, which helps the reader to understand all the different technologies (software, networking, terminals, PC, etc) that go into putting together a client/server system. Among the topics dicussed are what client/server is, how it can help your business, different types of ""clients"" and servers, a major section devoted to databases and client/server tools.If you have been put in a situation where you need to learn this technology fast, this book is a good place to start."
3,Gets the job done.,"Very good as a primer to get the ABCs of the subject, but even at that it is only very basic."
1,Narrow view of server only defines toys,I am having trouble finding anything in here about UNIX servers. For that matter I am having trouble finding anything on X servers. In the case of x servers the model is turned around 180 degrees. If there are no clients and no servers then this book is mislabeled. The Internet is based on UNIX. If it wanted to be an SQL book it should have said so. Again be sure to notice which the client is and which the server is as they are reversed in this book.Networking All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))
3,Over-priced and questionable quality,"The shelf looks good.That aside, unless you happen to be mounting it in such a way that the end pieces exactly line up with wall studs, then you'll need two anchor plugs...which naturally they didn't provide. Fifty bucks for a shelf, and they couldn't throw in a couple of 25-cent pieces of plastic. But they do tell you that you can go out and buy some. Fortunately, I had a bunch on hand, but still...And I'm not going to trust any weight to it, either.Nor do I think I'll ever buy another one.Did I mention, it looks good?"
1,Flying Nuns don't fly,50 cents worth of compressed sawdust and a thin coat of primer do not add up to a quality product! My husband could have done better with five feet of 1X6 pine and a can of Krylon. Lyndon Design and Woodform Products should be ashamed. People make fun of IKEA products but they are way ahead of the game. I'll never consider Woodform again for my home nor will my husband for any of his design clients.
4,Very Nice,These shelves are really nice. I was a little worried when I was reading some of the reviews but went ahead. The shelf is good quality and easy to install. I needed it to take small items out of reach of my son and these were perfect and very attractive! I will be getting more for my son's room.
3,"Can't argue with the music, but isn't it time for a reissue?","""12 Grandes Exitos"" uses the cover and many of the songs (""Maitechu Mia, ""Has Perdido Tu Tren,"" and the title track) from Mocedades' excellent early-eighties LP ""La Musica."" The question cannot help but be brought up-- When are we going to get a reissue of ""La Musica?""The is the second compilation to untilise the cover of ""La Musica"" (the other being ""20 de Coleccion""). Scandalously out of print for a few years now (couldn't even find it in Barcelona)...when are the compilations going to stop, and classic albums reissued?"
3,Bland Is The Band,"Jellyfish made retro hippie power pop, OK to listen to if you love the Beatles and wish the sixties were still with us, but frankly rather bland and recycled sounding to the rest of us"
4,Surprise!,"What a great surprise, I heard some short clips of this on a web-site and seemed to like it. I really like the album; a little pop but solid beat and easy to listen to on a road trip. Good purchase for not being familiar with this group. My CD came in good time and without incident."
5,great song writing,"this being there first album is amazing for both song writing, and production getting a huge sound at home or in your car. Bellybutton is a little more pop than Spilt Milk with it's couple of ballads, but still has it's rockers. Very Beatles, Beach Boys, Cheap Trick influenced but still original. If you have the opportunity to buy the import version with the 6 live tracks including 2 McCartney tunes and a Bad Finger tune, I recommend buying it now. It is well worth it."
5,"beautiful album, great band...wish they didn't split!","The first track I heard from these guys (""I Wanna Stay Home"") was in one of my fave films, ""Career Opportunities"" (which is also how I got interested in Soho and Tones On Tail). Their sound is very nostalgic and inspiring, and both the lead and backing vocals blend well with each other. I know this probably sounds cliche, but their vocal harmonies sound very reminiscent to the Beatles and Queen. The instrumental arrangements are well crafted, and the album leaves me with the feeling of it being more a carefully layered composition than just your average rock/pop band."
2,Disappointed,"The book seemed dry asnd lifless. the movie with Gene Tierny and Rex Harrison was infinitely better.In the book, Lucia only hears the voice of the ghost in her head. In the movie she actually sees the ghost or at least thinks she sees him. the movie is much more romantic. George Sanders is great as the ""cad"" Skip the book and get the DVD. You will love the movie. It is a classic."
3,"no surprises,,,,","I love the movie very much and normally I always say the book is better than the movie and that is because the book will have loads of things left out of the movie, but in this case, what was left out of the movie was without a doubt, Boring. I was disappointed in this book. I was hoping for a lot more, there was more, but it was just different and not very interesting. I'm sorry, I know most people are not going to agree with me!"
3,Different from the movie....,"I enjoyed reading this book, after being in love with the romantic version movie for as far back as I can remember. The movie definately took liberties in reworking the story, but it was interesting to read how it all was originally put down on paper. The only thing I think detracted from the story was the way they kept trying to analize everything. Outside of that, I thought it was a good ghost story"
5,"Shear off, Ye blasted mud turtle!!","The original and still the best. Some say the book is better than the movie, and I am inclined to agree. Spectacular binding and presentation, a product that can last for generations. The font is easy on the eyes, and overall guality is the highest, from the paper to the rugged covers and pleasant colors. You will not be disappointed in any way."
5,"Saw the movie, had to read the book",I loved the movie with Rex Harrison and Gene Tierney. After seeing it I knew I wanted to read the book. The book is an easy read and very enjoyable. It answered some questions that the movie didn't. I can't say I like the movie better than the book or visa versa. But the movie and the book together are fabulous.
4,Awesome,"Had this on my desk at work, along with other figurines, for a while. The color of the 'grease' isn't as sharp as it is in the picture and the cage is rather easy to knock out of it's slot.I enjoy it though."
3,Very sweet,"It's a soft, simple, pretty bumper. It looks beautiful in our cradle - except for the fact that its several inches too long. I would have given it 4 stars, but I just cant believe with all these reviews from people with 'standard' cradles, like mine, it's till too long! With some adjusting, nipping and tucking here and there (I wish I had a sewing machine) I've been able to get it to fit pretty snuggly, but still, it would be much nicer if it just fit like it's supposed to. But still, it's pretty, soft, sweet and simple - and if you have a sewing machine - Im sure you can make it perfect."
5,An interesting end-of-the world movie.,I had not heard of this movie before researching end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it movies and literature on Wikipedia. I found it very different and thought provoking. It was well worth the purchase price.
4,good early post apocalyptic flick,"an early 1951 post-apocalyptic movie about 4 men and 1 woman who ultimately find each other after the nuclear holocaust. anxiety about nuclear destruction and the cold war were very common themes in some sci-fi and horror movies of that time period. this movie isn't as campy as other reviewers may make it out to be. the acting isn't the best and not much for special affects, but still it is an entertaining movie. drama, conflict, racism, murder, are all blended in with a minimal background (filmed in director's arch oboler's frank lloyd wright cliff house). bonus material is fun: ""how to be an arch villian"" and ""secrets of deception"" are a couple of shorts, with recipes for a dirty martini and secret martini. also included is the trailer which really promises more than this movie could deliver. overall, an enjoyable viewing if you like the earlier b&w end of the world type of movies."
2,Personal Review of Peter Lehman's book,"I truly felt that Mr Lehman's writing was way too analytical. He analyzed to the hilt the songs Roy wrote, the way he dressed, etc. I think Mr Lehman read way too much into the way Roy Orbison performed his songs...the writing of his songs.I believe Roy knew what listeners of the time liked and wanted. I believe the dark glasses and dark clothing were just the way he wanted to market himself....to stand out from the crowd....not because of some deep dark pain as Mr. Lehman suggests.....But, then again, I thought (mistakenly) this book was going to be an biography, not an analytical writing.Sorry about that..~Cissy"
2,Lasted less than 1 month,"I bought this hair dryer and had to return it in less than 1 month, when the on/off/setting switch broke. Poor design - the switch is located right where your hand holds the dryer, so any movement of your hand can change the settings and wear the switch out quickly. Also, I kept inadvertently pushing the cool button, since it is also in that area. Also, it was very heavy - My bicep on my right arm is bigger than my left now! I gave it 2 stars because it was nice to have the multiple settings, but overall, it's poor quality."
1,Don't buy it if you style your hair,"After having a Vidal Sassoon dryer nearly explode (fan paddles broke, then dryer sparked) in my husband's hand, I decided to buy a different brand. Usually, even though I use hair dryers on a daily basis, they tend to last more than a year. This dryer has lots of blowing power and several settings but NO HEAT even on the high heat setting. If you just want to dry your hair quickly and not style it, then maybe this dryer is for you. I have had it 3 days and it's going back to the retailer."
1,Dont buy this!!!!,Ceramic Speed Styler by Conair is very SLOW and after 6 months of use it has now become even more slow !!!!!!!!I came across CONAIR hair dryer model 1875 and it was really very good. I saw this in one of the Hotels during my vacation. It was awesome. But the sad part is I am not able to find it online or on CONAIR website :(
4,Fairies & Humans...,"This is a sweet light story about Ariel, a lonely exiled queen of the flower fairies & her attempt to get herself pregnant so that she can be needed and have a purpose in life again. She picks out Rand a very handsome and kind man, & asks him to impregnate her! Needless to say her plans don't go exactly as she wishes.I won't say more just that it's a well written light read And I couldn't put it downRead Karen Fox's Somewhere My Love, it's a very well written Sci/fi story. Get it from the library if you must!"
3,Same as on SKY,"I was slightly dissapointed with this 45 minute length DVD. This is exactly the same footage as shown on the Nat Geo channel on SKY. Nonetheless it made for an enjoyable 2nd watch. You get real life interviews from 2 ex-members of the gang. This is all based from inside prison tho and you only get a very brief if not extremely violent insight into the workings of the AB. This DVD is a great visual compliment to a book called 'Blood in Blood Out'. I would recommend you buy the 2 products and enjoy :)Beware tho - there are NO added extras or anything, this is purely and simply the exact same documentary as on Nat Geo channel."
2,Hard to keep it up!!,"I had purchase this playard for my sister's baby shower because this product has everything! When we started setting it up, we could not keep it up. Two sides locked BUT the other two just didn't. We tried numurous time with different people and nothing. I returned the item back and got a new one. This one all sides locked, but it was hard to take it down. Once we got it down and tried to put it back up, we had the same problem as the first one. We could not keep it up!! I am returning it and will look for a different model."
4,new blues,chicago blues with a modern edge. donald kinsey is a very good guitar player. the closer they get to the blues the better they sound.
2,Avoid this feeder if possible.,"For all the people starting to feed birds, avoid this feeder. Why, this feeder has to many disadvantages. The problems I encountered with this feeder were, It's too hard to clean, it's not even squirrel proof, it discoureges cardinals, doesn't look nice, paint chips, can't acessorize it, and the seed ports are too small. Now I replaced this feeder with a Wild birds unlimited tube feeder and it's a lot beeter and looks great. Cardinals come to my new feeder a lot more and I get more birds unlike this peice of junk. I can clean it with ease and I can attach a tray to keep the ground cleaner. So if you want a tube feeder that will last many years, get a wild birds unlimited tube feeder or a droll yankees. (Wild birds unlimited carries that too). The feeders I reccomended might be a few more dollars than this bad feeder but it's worth it! To squirrel proof your feeder, use a baffle or safflower seed."
4,Smells fantastic! Bit of work.,"I just wanted to share a little feedback on this wax after applying it all day yesterday to a Porsche Cayenne S. This one is a hand wax. You apply it by melting it in your hands and spreading it on with your fingers. It takes a bit more time than your ordinary wax. It goes on smooth but takes quite a bit of rubbing to get it off. Don't let it dry to a haze or you'll rub your arms off trying to get it off. I can tell already that it is going to last quite awhile. It leaves a very hard finish that makes the whole garage smell amazing. It also shines as good as any wax I've used. I've got about 6 or 8 waxes in my fridge right now, but this one smells the best. 5 stars for product quality, 3 stars for effort involved in buffing. (Hence 4 stars) Don't even worry about the price. As far as handmade waxes go, this one is still a relative bargain."
3,Automobile Floor Mats for 2004 Chevy Silverado,"The quality of the product was excellent. The driver side floor mat fit perfect. However, the passenger side floor mat didn't quite fit the configuration that I needed for the truck. Doesn't match the picture."
1,Disappointed,"This item fails....I bought it for it's mutilfunction and network abilities.... It came without a network card, and the card it needed...came without a cable... Buy a cheap lazer printer and scanner and fax, and you will be better off. That is my opinion of this expensive and failed product."
4,Relax Into Stretch,"Very good. New stretches and techniques I've never tried. Too much ""Evil Russian Empire"" talk."
5,learn how to stretch the right way,After reading this book I was able to do the front and side splits within 3 months.Larry Manth
3,"Quick, and consistent","I gathered about four new concepts from this book, and that's pretty good. His focus on the reality of pain was a surprise in this time of ""don't hurt it"". If you are not making progress on your flexibility, it is worth a look."
4,As always entertaining but very good information. It helped me personally.,i have a lower back problem from a small injury with martial arts. Pavel shows his methodology for strenghtening the tendons between the muscles and the bones by relaxing into a stretch by using tension for short spurts. Good fun read.
3,Good Info In The Book But Overpriced,"All of Pavel's books including Relax Into Stretch have excellentinformation which it hard to find else where. However Pavel never invented the exercises nor he came up the research himself. However it is one of better stretching books in the market and I have got better results in my stretches with information found in Pavel's book. The main downside of thisbook and other Pavel's books is that his books including Relax Into Stretch are overpriced. That's why I put a three stars on this one. For those whom want to be able to do full front split or side split, I recommend Stretching Scientifically by Thomas Kurz over RelaxInto Stretch by Pavel Tsatsouline for a better run for your money."
4,I am touching my toes!!,"I have been actively applying the techniques taught in the book for about a month and have seen results. I was what you would call SUPER stiff. I haven't touched my toes since.......a long time. Well, I am now seated on the floor toe touching for a good 30 seconds and more. For me this alone is more than worth the price. That said, for some the price of the book may be steep and perhaps the info is in other books out there. For me it was the right book at the right time. A lower price would have made it 5 stars."
2,"Overpriced, undersized","This book is nothing more than big fonts, huge spacing, and large pictures to take up a lot of pages. For the price, you could buy two good books on stretching and get triple or more the information (Kurz is a good place to start). There's absolutely nothing new or fantastic about any of the ideas here, and he only has one or two stretches presented for each part of the body. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the book is a fast read and isn't the absolute worst place to start if you've never stretched before."
3,Feel the pain,"Ugh... Too tough for this old guy.I think it would have been great had I started 25 years ago, a few of the exercises are useful to those that are over the hill, but be careful. The distance between ahhh.. and pure pain is pretty narrow."
4,Try combining it with Bikram,"I loved the evil soviet jestfull style! Yes it should be cheaper! But seems unfair to say the only contribution of the book is just a presentation of PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) stretching. He gives useful cues for difficult streches (splits). Also even if the selection of streches is small, they are helpful for fit people, unlike say Bob Anderson's tame stretchesStretching: 30th Anniversary Edition. I am going to combine his ideas with Bikram yogaYoga Challenge I: Practice Manualeven if they don't see each other eye but ""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds""."
1,Terrible,"The author shows himself to be an ignorant Freudian, pointing the finger at everyone he can and using the term ""guru"" as an insult. While some of the assessments are correct in my opinion, the haughty attitude of the author makes the book unreadable. If you're looking for a onesided approach, buy this book!"
4,Hello... Pythagoras?,"Certainly an interesting book, but as far as Gurdjieff's 'outlandish cosmology,' the good doctor needs a dose of his own medicine and be somewhat less credulous.Gurdjieff followed the cryptic method of the Pythagoreans that he called ""burying the dog,"" a cloaking device mentioned by Cicero and Iamblichus.The lesson? Don't blindly believe everything you read."
5,this is Joan's Shining Hour,"This is one of those rare pictures that Joan made from the thirties that aren't very glamorous. Even though Joan doesn't get dressed up (except when she's a ""walking mannequin"" she's still so beautiful in each and every scene that she's in. In this picture, Joan plays Jessie Cassidy, a girl who marries a crook that tries to use her to a cheat a shipping magnate (Spencer Tracy.) This is a first-rate and an important film for many reasons. First, Joan is perfect in this role because this one of those roles that just seems tailor made for her. The lines come out of her mouth like poetry. This is also a great movie because it's the first and only paring of Joan and Spencer Tracy."
3,One of Crawford's Better Screen Performances,"The plot is predictable, but the performances are enjoyable. Crawford is too well-groomed to be completely believable as a menial laborer in the first half of the film, but she makes the most of her role and holds her own nicely against the inimitable Tracy. Recommended."
1,Great Idea/Low Quality,"Bought 3 of these phones, one for each teenager. Concept is great, phone quality is poor. Will be returning all 3 phones. I ignored the reviews and ordered them anyway! Reception is poor, phone makes clicking sounds, batteries won't hold charges, static on line. I can see 1 phone may have been bad but all 3 had the same problems and all 3 will be returned."
1,incredible letdown,"I bought this phone, expecting not to have any problems with it since I had bought vtech phones in the past, and not had a single problem. After buying this phone, I refuse to buy another vtech. I got it to use in my college dormitory, and any conversation thats longer than 30 seconds (and thats on a good day) is completely impossible unless of course, you're a guy.If you're looking for fun features like the one on this phone, I have only one suggestion: save your money and get a nokia!"
4,great phone cool phone teen people,i just got my phone 4 xmas and I LOVE IT! u can change the color 4 the phone blue orange and purple! and they bring songs 4 ringers and its cool b/c it caller id. i havnt noticed any problems with i yet and i am hopeing it wont have any promblems at all. my sises phone is cool too its a lill better b/c u can change the ring with recording ue voice or put the phone up to the cd player its awsome. but this phone is realy cool too. it acts like a cell phone so u ppl out there tht wants a cell phone get this b/c it acts just like 1. u can store peoples phne number in it and there name. and info about them. THIS PHONE IS AWSOME! GET IT.
1,Random interference that cut off conversations,"Great ringer, nice colors. However the phone would randomly cut you off during conversations with incredible interference. :("
5,Just Try Again? Or NOT!,"Well the first time I brought this phone, there was a malfunction and wouldnt connect with my phone line. So I returned it but decided to give it another shot and I'm happy that I did. This is a great phone and I'm going to love it even more in college. The ringers are unique and the phone overall is just good. I love the fact that you can change the colors to match different areas. I dont have any static problems or any problems at all for that matter. Even if I did the phone has a limited 1 year warranty and a number you can call for help. This one is a winner in my book! Other say that had problems, maybe they have a phone that has a defect? It could happen, so just try again but with the same phone, its worth it"
1,Extremely Dissatisfied,"I just had to have this phone because I like the different ring tones on it, but when I finally bought the phone and brought it home and started using it after charging it. It has ALOT of static in it, it has also cut me off of my conversations with my kids teacher and I was very upset. I'am currently looking for another phone after only having this one for less than six months. My advise to people looking to buy a phone is &quot;DO NOT BUY THIS ONE OR THE ONE WITH THE ANSWERING SYSTEM!&quot;"
1,Garbage,I bought one of these and had to have the company send me a new one. All that I had was constant static and the caller id call waiting didn't work. I decided to return the first one and send the second one back to the company. Save your money and time and aggravation. Don't buy this.
1,Ugh,"The idea of this phone was good, and it was awesome they had different color plates, yet... I got this phone about a year ago, waited for it to charge... for a week... yes I gave it a week, and nothing happened, nothing worked. Now it sits in the closet. This phone would have been fun, too bad it didn't work out."
2,Waste of Money,"This phone has some cool features with the different ring tones and the changeable face plates. But I ended up returning this phone because the static is horrible, even switching the channels does nothing. The static is worse than the twenty dollar GE phone I have."
2,Worst phone i ever bought,"i thought you know maybe this phone would be cool for the dorm, ive had it for a little over a year now and its horrible, granted the changeable faceplates and ringers are neat but it has very poor reception, i keep losing a signal, then i get this weird noise when im on the phone the person im talking to can hear me but i can't hear them and end result of that is i have to put it back on the charger for a few mins. its just a piece of crap."
3,It wuz okay,"I have a few issues with the batteries dying on me within an hour of conversation, but the reception isn't bad when it's dying out on me. The ringtones are great for beginners, but I had issues with putting new ringtones on my phone...the tempo would always go too fast or too slow, even after adjusting the beats per minute. But I love the colored plates, and lighting. Ohh and the animations are great.Overall it'z an okay phone."
4,great phone for a great price,I love this phone. It works great all the time. I bought it because I liked the faceplates. Its got great ring tones and is over all a great phone.
1,Fashionable DUD,"I bought this phone and 3 months later I am looking for another phone. The battery life is really poor-the handset is suposed to warn you when it needs charging and it doesn't. If I talk even close to 20 mins I get static on my end so bad I cannot hear. The only cure for this is to put the phone on the base. It will not turn off, change channels or anything else unless this is done- which means you can't talk any longer and you have no warning. I really would not purchase this phone again. The ringer options are cute although some only sound remotely like the songs they are suposed to. I would not reccomend this phone and if you buy it I hope you have better luck."
3,cheesed off,i really like the look of the phone and the idea of the whole thing. but it is being really stupid. Every oncein a while it won't let me hang up unless it is on the charger and i can't put my own rings in. i keep going to the website to get the thing that tells you how to do it. i downloaded it but you can't read how to do it and i downloaded the converter and nothing comes up? is anyone else having these problems and is anyone able to help me? plz i need help!!
2,Loved it at first now I don't like it at all,"When I bought the phone less then a year ago I loved all the cool features about it. Now I am searching for a new one because when I am talking to someone all of a sudden they will be able to hear me but I can't hear them, all I hear is static on the line, pretty aggervating. This is a hassle I have to place the phone back on the charger a wait a few minutes. I have lost important calls because of it. I paid a higher price for this phone, I don't think it is even worth it's current price, sorry. I recommend you continue your search, I hope this helps."
1,Junk - don't buy,"Nice LOOKING phone but useless, as it stopped working after only one month! I was so frustrated I threw it in the garbage, didn't even want to bother with the warranty. Should have recycled it though.. Too bad I had to give it one star."
2,is this a toy?,I've been eyeballing this phone for quite some time. So I purchased it yesturday and boy what a dissapointment. The phone has nice features but thats about it.Unfortunantly I read the reviews after I purchased the phone. On the first day the phone was okay then (today) the second day I noticed this popping sound in the phone. I know it isnt my phone line becuase my other phones work perfectly fine. Bottom line is if you were thinking of purchasing this phone save yourself a headache. Dont do it! For those who have purchased this phone and have had no problems with it...consider yourselves lucky.
2,Poor phone!,"I was like many who read the reviews but bought the phone anyway. It has really great ringers and everything but the crackling and static during the conversations are not cool. I thought maybe my phone would be different. Wrong, my friend! I am going to return it because it is aggravating. My caller id waiting also does not pick up my calls. I do not recommend this phone to anyone. So those that do read this review, please take heed to what we are saying. Vtech I hope you read these reviews and take the criticism and time to upgrade these phones. How bout throwing in some free ones for those that may give you another chance."
2,"great features, BAD phone","I bought the phone because of the cool features like the ring tones and the faceplates, which all that was cool and as promised. But when it came time to actually talk on the phone, IT FAILS MISSERABLE the phone makes a clicking/popping noise when you are talking to anyone. It sounds like someone keeps pushing the flash button in the middle of your conversation, but 20 times per conversation. I loved the features and as much as I didn't want a boring phone, I had to face it. If you want a cool ringing phone this is it, but if you actually plan on talking on it, I'd shop elsewhere. And the funniest part is, is that I read a review of the same problem with popping on the line and I said &quot;oh well it was probably just hers, I want the cool phone and it is worth it&quot; Well I WAS WRONG, KEEP YOUR RECIEPT"
3,"Good features, BAD reception!!!","Hello,I am 13 years old, and bought this phone for my room. I LOVE THE RINGTONES! But, I tried to download ringtones from the internet, and it is confusing, difficult, and when it finally works, it comes out extremely fast. This doesn't really bother me because I like the 007 ringer. The Caller ID works great. The reason I would not recommend this phone, is because of the static. When I go into my kitchen, which is about 80 feet from the base, I start to hear a clicking noise, then if I go even a little bit further, it starts to get horrible. The reception should be much better. I had a 900mhz phone that worked better than this 2.4 Ghz!! So, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE AT ALL!!!!!!"
1,Terrible reception,"I thought this was a cute phone. I was delighted that it would be easy to find because of the changeable face plates and light-up antenna and faceplate.After charging it the recommended amount of time, and a few successful uses, it has gone on the blink. Within less then four minutes of conversation, my side of the reception begins to get static and then washes out totally. Selecting the channel scan button only makes it beep uncontrollably, and the only way to hang up is to re-cradle the phone in the base unit.I have investigated the website's very few options for troubleshooting and have not found this issue addressed. Calling support for help is out of the question as this is our only phone. We are returning it tonight.I really wish it worked, because I love everything else about it."
2,Disappointed,"I'm not a teenager, but I bought this phone because of the different ring tone choices (I thought it would be fun). Well, I was right about the rings, that's pretty neat. Everything about this phone lives up to it's reputation EXCEPT reception. After a few seconds of having the phone ""On"" it's very noisy with lots of static. When I push the ""Off"" button to hang up, that won't work. I have to place the phone into the base to get it to hang up. It's a shame that the reception stinks on this phone because everything else about it works great.However, it's going back to the store today."
1,Popped and crackled - Horrible reception!!!,"I have two toddlers begging for my attention, but I am so disappointed with this phone I want to take two seconds to warn others about this phone's poor quality. The phone looked like fun, but after charging the battery as recommended, then plugging it in, the reception was immediately staticy. I could hardly hear the other person and it was annoying to the point I wanted to throw the thing in the garbage. Changing the channels did nothing to improve it. The fun rings the phone advertises have a cheap electronic sound, too. I would not buy this phone."
2,"Looks ""cool,"" but not worth it","I went against the grain--knowing I shouldn't have--and bought this phone over better brands like Panasonic and Sony. Unfortunately, the novelty of the ringtones and changeable faceplates quickly faded away and I was left with a below average phone. The reception is poor and very quiet, and just holding to my ear felt abrasive, most noticeably after longer conversations.Eventually the phone completely went down the tube with the battery dying, but even if that hadn't happened, it still would get this same two-star rating. I've since replaced it with a mid-range Panasonic phone that is infinitely better than this one. Sure, maybe this phone didn't drive me to the point of homicidal rampage, but many better phones in its price range exist that you'd be better off purchasing."
1,This phone is awful!,"First, let me say that I have another v-tech phone - that works great! But this one couldn't be worse! I bought the phone for my daughter thinking it would look nice in her room. It's cute all right, but after about 6 months - during which time she used it maybe 3 or 4 times for no more than 5 minutes per call - it simply stopped working. I thought it was a bad battery and bought a new one. Guess what...the battery was not the problem, the charger in the base simply stopped charging! You can't use a cordless phone with no battery...and since a charge only lasts 5 days...that's the length of time this phone will work. I would never consider a phone like this again. Don't waste your money like I did. It may be cute, but it doesn't work."
2,A Very Fun Phone -- But Poor Reception,"This phone promised pure fun. It looks cool. The colors change. It lights up and plays music of many different kinds. But the ""snap, crackle, pop"" reception is more than I can bear so back it goes. Too bad, really . . ."
1,Everything is great except what matters.,"As stated in my title above, I have but one big problem with this phone. The reception is awful, and no channel changing is going to fix it. I feel this is true with almost all cordless phones today. I have an at least ten years old, or perhaps not, 900 mhz. Toshiba that still has the best reception I can find. Unfortunatly, in its old age, it does not seem to hold a charge as long, and I find my self replacing its battery far too often. But, I digress. I just want a phone with good reception, and this V Tech is not it."
4,Fun,"I bought this phone when it first came out. I was so excited. It's a lot of fun. the only thing about it that I dont like is that about every 10-15 seconds there a ""crackle...pop!"" noise. It doesnt bug me too much but it could bug other people. Its a really cool phone. all my friends were impressed."
3,It could have been better,I had this phone for over a year. At times I loved it and at times I went searching for other phones. I replaced it once but the replacement died and decided to give this one another chance. Part of the problem was I didn't read the instructions or just forgot some. I think some of the people reviewing this phone are having the same problem. If you are getting a bad connection you should try changing the channel. Everytime you add a wireless device or electronic device you run the chance of causing problems with other wireless devices. Changing the channel fixed a problem I had and I bet it would have fixed some of the other reviewers problems also.Prosringtonessilent flashgood range I can take it outsidegood lcdconsno EASY way to add ringtonesno speakerphone option
1,Don't Waste Your Time/Money,"I decided to try this phone despite the handful of bad reviews. I figure, hey anybody can get a lemon, not to mention these cordless phones are all pretty finicky about where you place them and what you place them next to.So I figured I would give it a shot.To be fair, the phone has some good features, like its very cool design. The ring tones; the orange backlit display; the flashing keypad; and the interchangeable color plates make this phone seem like a great product. But what good is that if you can't use the phone to talk. If the handset finds the base (and I do mean IF) then all you get is static. I try to change the channel, the phone locks up and I have to put it back on the base. Awful. Here today, gone tomorrow. Back to the store it goes."
1,Not worth the $,I bought this phone because it looked cool and I loved the features it worked great for about 2 monthes and then it would be clear for about 30 seconds before it became full of static and I could not hear. I had bought my brother in law the same phone and he is having the same problem I think maybe its a factory defect that was overlooked I hope they fix it Because I really love this phones features
2,Teen Phone Buyer,I recently purchased this phone and it does not work worth a darn. The sound quality isn't very good and using it around tv's computers and stereos makes it staticy. Sure the faceplates and ringtones are awesome. But the sound quality STINKS!
1,A recall is in order!!!!,"Face it!!!!! This phone needs to be recalled!!!!!!!!! I thought it was great, an hour after wrting a positvie review, it got extremely noisy and you had to take the batterie out to turn the junk yard collection material (VMIX PHONE) off!!!!Don't waste your money!!! Even if it was to work, don't risk it!!!!!!Get Grand Theft Auto Vice City instead!!!!"
1,Looks aren't everything. Don't waste your time or money!,"I purchased this phone because it looked really cool, and the features sounded great. It didn't take long to realize that was all the phone had going for it. I began to experience problems with interference, and the phone would refuse to turn off. Then it began making a horrible crackling noise after you were talking for over 20 minutes or so. After this occured, you couldn't get the phone to turn off or do anything. I was very disappointed in this phone. It was a good idea, but it is very poorly made. I returned this phone. Just don't waste your time or money on this phone. It is not worth it."
2,Fun but not fun enough,"I bought this phone for my new apartment, loving the color changeability. Overall this phone rings only when it wants to. If I pick it up and it is working then I can't hang it up, I have to take it back to the base. I called the VTECH people and they are going to replace it so if you are having the same trouble, I recommend calling them. I hope my new phone works because I do like the ring tones and the look of the phone."
4,This phone is great,The V-mix phone is great! It is ideal for teens everywhere. The awsome features make the phone even better. The only thing that might cause a small problem is the ringer isn't loud anough. I only know the phone is ringing if i am in the room with it or I hear my other phones ringing. I love how you can change the color of the base and handset plates. I recomended this phone for any teen who wants more than just a plain jane phone.-Katie-
2,"Initially fun, but awful problems in just one week","Just like another reviewer here, my phone would be great for a few minutes and then start producing nothing but awful static. Couldn't change channels, couldn't turn off. Had to set it back in the base. Followed the instructions very carefully when initially charging the battery before using, batteries were fully charged. No rhyme or reason, it just started doing it less than a week after I got it. Luckily I had the receipt and was able to return it. The price was great, and the features were fun, but Vtech is off of my list for a while."
2,Worked for awhile,I got this phone in December. It worked great until 2 days ago when the caller id suddenly stopped working. I now have to go buy a new phone. Other than that it was a great phone.
1,I hope 3 times is a charm!,"We bought this phone for our daughter for her birthday. Followed all the directions, and after it was charged, it would not function. You would get No Connect. Tried different phone jacks with the same result. Called V-Tech, and they told me phone was faulty. Brought this one back, and exchanged it. The new one works for 10 seconds, then goes dead with the same problem. No Connect! We owned a V-Tech phone several years ago, and vowed NEVER to get another one after the bad experience. My daughter loves what this phone should be able to do. Today, I'm bringing this one back to get a 3rd one. I dont know how much more I can take. I wish I would have read all these reviews before be bought ours. Do yourself a favor, buy anthing else."
1,Bad ZERO STARS,"I had the same experience as another reviewer. After a few minutes on this phone, static would overtake the phone call and then I couldn't hang up the phone, I had to unplug from wall. Only had this phone for 2 weeks."
1,Do not buy this!,"This phone is awful! It took 24 hours to charge, then doesnt even work! If your planning to buy it, make sure its not by any electronics (TVs, radios, computers etc) and if its going to be by any walls dont even think about it. I couldnt hook it up to my modem, it just wouldnt even work. Whenever I tried to call someone then it would take about 10 seconds and static was all you could hear. I was very disappointed, it was a great idea, but it would've been better if it worked."
1,Awful,I loved this phone until the last 2 days. I got this phone in Sept...it is now the end of Dec and it has broke. Never dropped...never damaged. I will be 5 minutes into a phonecall and all the sudden it goes to major static. (even though the battery is fully chagred) To the point you cannot hear the person on the other end...you have to end up hanging up on them. When you push the OFF button it won't turn off. HIGHLY disappointed in the quality of this phone. Normally I buy VTech products...but this one I am disappointed in. :(
3,just for dvd,"does what it is supposed to do very well: play dvd from all region. I also wanted to use it to listen to my cds, no way! the quality of the sound is just unbearable. fair enough for the price!!!"
4,All the power... money... wealth... sex... greed... and ol' J.R.,"Well, we've finally get what all us DALLAS fans have been wanting for years: our favorite soap on home video. Of course those of us who loved to see J.R., Bobby, Cliff and Ray with their shirts off will be freeze framing to our heart's content. Others who loved to watch J.R. scheme, connive and seduce his way to the top will be happy as well. It's been a long time in coming but it's been worth the wait!"
1,SCRATCHED!!!!!!!!!!!!,So the first couple of disks were ok. But right as I was getting into this series 2 disks were completely scratched. It won't play even a little. Very disappointed. Will not be making purchases from here again!
3,Hopefully includes the first 5 episodes,"I can only hope that the included the very beginning of Dallas, unlike the networks who seem to forget about it often on reruns.The mini series that started it all is what I'm referring too, the first 5 episodes which really paint the picture for the beginning of the saga of the Ewing and Barnes. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT FORGET THESE!!!"
1,Who wants to remember this garbage......,"This was one of the worst Tv shows ever. We had to put up with almost a decade of back stabs, booze, a murder climax, the infamous shower season opening, and the list goes on. You must be a fat guy who is unemployed to watch this."
3,Another Great Show....Another Mediocre DVD set,"How can I complain when I am getting hours and hours of entertainment like this for only $34.99? Well...here goes. This is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest show to come out of the 1980s (yes, I know it began in 1978). However, since this is a show that changed the TV landscape, you would think Warner Bros. would have enough respect to go back and clean up the old films. Nope. There is dust, scratches and debris all over this thing! Though certain scenes looks great, esp. in terms of colors, others, especially the intro credits, look awful. The sound was not fixed up or anything. It looks like Warner Bros did NOTHING to remaster this material. A true shame. Such a WONDERFUL SHOW deserves a better transfer than this, however you can't beat the price. I would be willing to pay more for a better set though."
5,Good Show!,"Unfortunately, I got seasons 3 & 4 in the mail before 1 & 2, so I started watching season 3 and now I'm completely hooked. All I can say is Dallas is more exciting to me now (being in my early 30s) than it was to me 25 yrs+ ago when it was actually on TV.My mom has just ordered seasons 5-7 for my birthday for me and told me to order season 8 when it comes out as well.The only downside to my watching Dallas is that my husband is a 49ers fan & he actually grew up watching Dallas and hates the theme song...lol.It's a good show, and I really like it."
1,dallas series 1 and 2,"just recieved my dallas 1 and 2 collection and i must say was pretty upset when i played disc 2 and most of this disc stopped and paused every 3 seconds, how can you watch a show when it does that. i would like a new disc,"
2,not good customer service,I purchased this Dallas set and one of the CD's was a double. Disk 3 was the same as Disk 4...so that means I was missing one of the disks. I contacted the seller and asked that this one CD be sent to me and he/she ignored my email. Will not purchase from this vendor again.
5,I Just Can't Wait!!!!!!,"Oh, my God, oh my God, oh my God!!!! Dallas finally for me to watch when I do want it (and I will want it so very very often, believe me!!). Surely, its the greatest show ever produced. How can anyone forget JR and Sue Ellen? I have already ordered mine. I definetely hope that all seasons get released especially cuz down here in Brazil we never got to see the shows end."
3,"good, but better still to come","The short first season (estended mini series and the next season all on 5 discs with some great extras, commentaries and reunion reaturette. Dallas ran 11 season, my favourites being seasons 3-8. But these are still solid episodes, and they lay the groundwork for all to come. But these were before they had season spanning story arcs, most of the episodes are 90% one shot storylines. Cant wait for all seasons to be released, I hope they release them 2 seasons at a time."
1,Poor dvd quality,The brightness in this dvd is terrible. The picture is so dark it can hardly be seen and in several places the picture freezes for a while. Poor copy.
4,Dalls 1&2 Season DVD,Have enjoyed it. Wish DVD's were not dual sided as one of my players will not read the back side but it a great purchase. Quality good.
3,for fans or those who need to watch from the start,"Dallas' many seasons differ so much so, they are like seperate movies in themselves. I would snap up season '83/'84 and '86/'87 without hesitation.Like 'Falcon Crest' and even 'Dynasty' the very first season(s) of 'Dallas' is often nothing like the un-matchable quality of later ones.The first season has the true characteristics, although season 2 is sometimes a little dated, yet has all the top characters all there!"
5,BACK IN TIME,"I watched Dallas way back when my kids were small children. As a baby boomer, I am not wild about alot of what is on TV today. I am so glad that I can buy old TV series and movies for less then they are in stores and be sure that I am getting the product I paid for and was promised! Worth every penny, especially getting it for Christmas when I was expecting it after."
3,Karen Lara/Mi opinion,"Los libros de Karen lara tienen recetas muy sencillas y eso no es necesariamente bueno. El problema de los libros de Karen Lara es que no tiene oraciones/conjuros que va con los trabajos/recetas y el conjuro/oracion es lo mas importante para que salga bien la receta. Hay unas recetas muy simples de hacer pero no funcionan, se lo aseguro! Las recetas de amor donde se hacen con el muneco de cera y cera de campeche si son efectivas.Este libro lo recomiendo para las recetas de dinero, no para amor"
5,The Five Star Book Of 2006,"An exciting adventure, this book challenges readers to go beyond their knowledge of Florida history and try something new. This book has great characters and a gripping plot that will leave readers begging for more. As a beginning novel, this book beats lall the standards. Watch out Florida because here come the book that is even better that ""A Land Remembered!"""
4,Daevid Allen - 'Solo At The Axiom Cheltenham '98' (Bananamoon Obscura) 4 1/2 stars,"Amazingly, a darn good solo gig of Daevid Allen playing in a tiny-hole-in-the-wall club with reportedly maybe seventy patrons present. Show took place at the Axiom in Cheltonham, UK. Best tracks are the Gong-like ""Unriddle Me Gliss Then"", the very cool sounding ""Shadowself"", ""My Penis Is Not Aging"", the sixteen-minute ""Hours Gone"" and ""Magick Brother"". Allen was doing a great job with his acoustic, electric and gliss guitars. True, maybe not every Gong fan may like this No. 15 release as much as I did but most should at least get something good out of it."
4,Another good cleanser from H2O Plus,"This cleanser is light and gentle, but still leaves skin feeling clean. It doesn't lather like the Oasis Cleansing Water, but it gets the job done. The beads in the cleanser are not rough at all, so I those with sensitive skin should be able to use this without fear. I can see myself buying this one again in the future."
2,I am probably the only person who has read this book.,"It appears to be written in English, na li? But I couldn't understand it. Why do post-modernists have to use such turbid prose. Do they only write for each other? Does each author seek to create his own personal language, unreadable, opaque and undecipherable to others?Still, I think there is something valuable imbedded in all this sediment, I just don't know what it is."
5,Wonderfully written! And very sexy!,I loved this book! I actually got it becuase the title caught my eye... I didn't realize it was one in a series... but it didnt matter! I loved it and I am going to the store today to buy the rest of the series! It is a must read. It made me laugh and panic along with the characters. My husband got mad at how much I was reading... until I was done. :) heehee Read it! you wont be sorry!
4,The Diamond plays his hand,Ethan Damont was introduced to us in Celeste Bradley's previous Liars' Club novels. He was an interesting character and she has given him his own story while telling us more little snippets about the Liars' Club and the people we have met in the past. Ehtan does not really want to be a Liar but decides to give it a try out of boredom. He soon finds himself in well over his head and floundering. Along the way he comes to care too much [in his opinion] for Jane - until it is necessary to rescue her. That description was the best part of the story. Very amusing.
1,Oh please - spare me,"As a devotee of Pride and Prejudice,I have read many sequels, including Berdoll's first, which I enjoyed. This book was a tedious, cliched, poorly written disappointment. A flimsy, unimaginative plot, repetitious to the extreme, with no depth to the characters. Enough about Darcy and Elizabeth's sex lives, we get it already!! Just how many different ways do we need to read about their libidos? Darcy and Elizabeth are reduced to either having or thinking about sex, and very little else. If you remove the sex, the 480 pages would probably reduce by a third. Also, the pretentious overuse of the words compleat, connexion, frisson, etc., were annoying to the point of distraction. Save your money."
3,Not as good as the first,"I LOVED Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife. This sequel of the sequel is slow and boring. It is WAY too long and I guess she must be writing a third because we were left hanging on a few things that didn't make sense (Caroline, Mrs. Bennet, what the heck happened to Kitty and Mary?). What was the point of Daisy the girl/woman prostitute? Random, random, random. Try again."
2,Very explicit sexually,I just didn't feel this author's works were up to Austen standards. I don't feel it was true to the time or the characters. I'll keep the passion where it needs to be - private. Just not my cup of tea.
2,What garbage...,"This was the first P&P sequel I read and fortunately I didn't let it prevent me from reading other sequels and variations. Three main comments that other people have made: the book is smut (I enjoy sexual scenes but these were just too much and too gratuitous), the plot stinks, and the story is unbelievably repetitive. Read something else. This book is a waste of time."
1,Crime against Jane's life work,"Horrible, hated it, couldn't finish it, it was so bad, sold it to used book store hoping no one else would ever read it"
3,A little disappointed.,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the first book, I was a little disappointed with the second, there are a lot of pages for not a lot of story. Also, some of the characters, particularly Lady Catherine are just a bit too far removed from their Austen originals for my liking. I am also sure that the spa town of Buxton would not be happy in being called Bruxton, when all others in the book have been spelt correctly! Overall, this book is great if you want a quick read, but will not please Austen purists."
2,"Tedious at first, but overall Fun!","If you can get past the first 13 chapters, you will be home free. I kept thinking I was reading the same page over again. The author re-established the facts so many times that it made the time line a little hard to follow.However, I love Linda Berdoll's ideas with the development of characters. The overall plot is fun and interesting, and when the pace picked up, it was hard to put down."
2,Not as intresting as the first.,"It took me a good long while to suffer through this book. It jumps around way to much. I only bought the book because it was recommened with her first, ""Darcy Takes A Wife"". I did not enjoy this as much as her fisrt. The plot thickens as you read but, it takes a while to get there."
1,Leave Miss Jane Alone!,I understand the author's crush on Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy but this does not give her license to change the essential character of Miss Jane's people. Anyone who believes good sex solves everything should be writing in the Romantic Porn industry not mucking up classic literature.
1,Just read the first book... You'll get the gist,"So, I absolutely loved the first book. It was an interesting take on what could happen after Darcy and Elizabeth marry. But don't spend any time or money on this sequel, if you have the first. I get that Berdoll might want to summarize what happened in the first book. Ok, fine. But don't write a second book summarizing the first.It was dull. And repetitive. And don't waste any money on this pathetic attempt at writing a novel."
2,Poor Kindle Edition,"The Kindle edition of this book does not match the print copy. The chapters are out of order, making it difficult to go back and forth between my book and my Kindle."
