2,Going to try an alternative,"Thank goodness for Amazon reviews. I was about to spend $99 for a mat but stopped myself after reading that these mats curl. I contacted Gelpro to see if they have fixed the problem. To my shock they didn't even acknowledge the problem. They told me that the issues with curling are ""not indicative"" of their product. Oh well.Here's the alternative that seems to work for me--buy a nice $25 area rug and buy a $25 RidgeRest sleeping pad (the accordion style). Trim the RidgeRest to fit under the area rug and then place the sleeping pad under the area rug. This is very comfy and functional for a home kitchen. A spare yoga mat would also work I think."
1,Thanks for the review,"I was very interested in getting this mat for myself because I have arthritis in my feet, legs and back. I am glad that I read the reviews. I started watching the floor model mat in the store and noticed that the edges do roll up and could pose a tripping hazard. You all saved me a couple hundred dollars. Thanks!"
2,Read all reviews- but its seems the edges pull up often,"My wife saw these mats on a TV show and put them on her Christmas ""wish list"". We cook for hours together and enjoy with a passion. However I want to thank everyone for their reveiws. It seems these mats have an issue with the edges pulling up and the warranty does not hold true to the lifespan of the product. Thank you all and I will look elsewhere to fullfill her ""wish list"""
5,My back feels better when I cook,"I am loving our mat! I can stand and cook and work in the kitchen longer with our comfortable mat under my feet. I especially like it in bare feet, it feels so good. I actually have less back pain when working in the kitchen now that we have our gel-pro mat!"
5,GEL PRO MAT - A GREAT EXPEREINCE,"I purchased one then 2 more Gel Pro Mats for my kitchen. I had serious spinal reconstructive surgery and I have fibromyalgia, so I deal with chronic pain. These are an instant relief from my pain and allow me to be in my kitchen and prepare meals now. That was an impossibility for me before having these mats. I am delighted to be able to buy American Made products and also have the quality and relief that are so critical for me."
3,comfortable but not quality,"I bought a pair of these for my kitchen about 9 months ago. When I first received them the edges of the matt were turned up. I had thought this would go away with time but it has actually gotten worse so it is a tripping hazard. It also was advertised as having a non-slip backing. I have tile floors in my kitchen and the mats move around pretty freely. I will say they are comfortable to stand on and I can stand up longer in my kitchen without back pain but considering the cost, the quality could definitely be better."
1,don't waste your money,"although a viable concept, these mats will not serve you well. like so many others my experience is the same: they developed splits in less than a year. i sent the required photo under warranty and the claim was denied. i usually wear slippers or am barefoot when cooking. now a year and a half later all four corners on my two mats are curled up and have turned into a constant trip hazard. i should just throw them out, but keep justifying their presence because of the exorbitant price i paid for them"
1,Edges Turn Up - Flawed,We own the gel-pro mat and it was great for about a year or so then the edges started turning up. We kept tripping over them and they just keep getting worse. Too bad - it is comfortable under the feet but a flawed product.
1,Disappointing,"I bought one of the 20X72 inch mats for my wife two years ago to cushion our feet on the hard tile kitchen floor. This year we threw it away. The cover began to harden, curl and crack and it became an ugly, slippery tripping hazard. What a waste of money. To replace it we went to a woodworkers supply store and found decent mats for about $15 each. Not as classy looking (greyish black rubber material) but I bet they last a lifetime."
2,curling edges,"I too looked a long time for mats, reading about them and their different qualities. I settled on the 24x72 black, it remains good for the comfort, but, as others have stated, the edges have curled up all the way around. This is unfortunate as I purchased 2 for our church kitchen and with big pots we must often carry, our vision of the floor is impaired, so we will have to take extreme caution. Mine is about 2years old."
1,Poor Quality,"This is an expensive mat, was comfortable and pretty.... yet after 8-9 months the edges curled up causing most everyone to trip, not a good idea in the kitchen...it also got depressions on the top of the mat, looking terrible.Expensive and it didn't even last, Never again. Gel Pro makes Cheap products, just wait until your mat is about one year old and you will very much regretgiving it a 4 or 5 star rating. Time tells the truth."
5,Soothing,"I love these mats. I had bought two of these for my mom and a 72""L one for myself previously. I bought this one to put in front of my stove, the longer one is in front of my kitchen sink area. These prevent my feet from getting sore and tired when standing for long periods of time. My cousin's wife stood on the one at my mom's and loved it so much she asked where it was from so that she could also get one for their house."
2,hazardous mat,hazardous matThese mats were a dream come true at first; I could cook all day and not have hip or knee pain. Now the edges are so severely curled that they are a tripping hazard. They are not worth the money if you are expecting to get a year or more out of them.an unhappy customer that would love to cook all day
5,BWoo,"The bronze shoe was so spectacular looking on my feet I decided to order a pair in the black, which I can use with black or silver. The price is certainly very affordable for the type of shoe that it is. Love Them, BW"
3,Just the same as the episode.,"This novel adapts The X-Files pilot episode. Dana Scully has been assigned to the X-Files with the main aim to debunk them, but is quickly drawn into Fox Mulder's world of conspiracy and alien abductions. They're investigating a town where kids from the class of '89 are all being found dead with 2 identical scars on their bodies. As the book is only an adaptation from the series is doesn't really shed much light on the characters - it's pretty much what you see in the episode on tv is what you'll find here. Still it is good if you dont have access to the show for reminiscent purposes only."
4,Incredible shine!,"I first tried Lundmark's Poly Pro-Tech about 10 years ago and was wow-ed by the gorgeous shine. It has since become increasingly difficult to find locally, but it is well worth ordering online. You cannot beat the beauty & shine of this product."
3,"Tech correct, but really bad as a study guide.",I work as a teacher and teach Netware and NT. One of the classes I had used this book and I must say that it was a horrible book to hold lessons from. The material for the different tests was spread across the whole book and it was filled with bad jokes. If you took away all the jokes and concentrated on the important material in the book you could get it down by atleast 400 pages. The only good thing about it was that it was technically correct.
1,I am critical of this book's approach to CNA,"I have no pleasure in announcing that I feel Clarke's approach is awkward, indirect, and often impertinent. I would rather not report this opinion, but I feel that this author spends too much time philosophizing and promoting, and too little time explaining. He certainly tries, and, in my opinion, too often misses. The CDs included are not instructional, and file listings on some pages are known to be incorrect -- negatives not commensurate with a production of this cost and importance. Sorry . . ."
2,"what a joke, I'd rather read whitepapers...","As a professional in the field, I am apalled that such a book can exist. Who wants to learn about philosophy? Why can't anyone write a book that just lists the facts? Don't sugar coat anything or waste time with funny stories and anecdotes like this author did. Just get to the point."
3,Save the trees,Once you get past the korny jokes and korny zen phrases you finally get to the Useful information. These two books could have easily compiled to one.. The author needed to focus on content instead of filling pages with useless text...
2,Good Content Amidst Annoying Jokes,If you can stand wading through endless cutesy jokes you will be rewarded with good sound information.
3,A mixed review,"I sought out this book because of an article in the NY Times profiling Larry Brown's son, Billy Ray, and the dairy farm he owns. Some of the essays in this book are terrific and others didn't catch my fancy so I gave the book a neutral review. With any book of selected writings, you expect some will be better than others. I do like Brown's world view so I would recommend this book and just add you can skip the stuff that doesn't grab you."
1,West Bend electric skillet,I purchased one like this from WalMart. Apparently the one I got was defective because it overheated - didn't shut off when it reached temperature. It actually melted the end of a spatula! I took it back and I'm going to try a different brand - leery of getting another West Bend.
1,Disappointed not made in USA as advertised.,"This may or may not be a good product. I was looking for a new Electric skillet and my ONLY reason for choosing this particular one was that the Amazon web page described it as ""Made in USA"". When I received it and found out it was made in China I returned it unused."
1,There are much better books on CMM,"While implementing CMM in our company we read about all books on CMM currently on the market.This book is one of the worst we read. Most of the paper is just filling (especially the last chapters, written by a student). The thing that is ""good"" about the book is the case study in one chapter on how CMM is implemented in NASA on a very high level. I don't know where where the other reviewer got the ""sense of humour"" from.If you want to know more about CMM you're better off buying the book on CMM by Mark C. Paulk."
4,"Heartbreaking, but excellent reading","I found this book among a box of old books that were left behind in a basement. Because of my Cherokee heritage, I was compelled to read The Dull Knifes of Pine Ridge. And now, I'm glad I did. It is heartbreaking to read how the white man treated the Indian and everything that was done to them. This book tells of events that took place and aren't at all very pretty, especially in the Viet Nam era. If The Trail of Tears was found to be an enjoyable read, then you must read this story about the Lakota Indians. I enjoyed every page."
4,Sad litany of broken promises,"While most readers who have read any books about the plight of the American Indians will find little that is surprising in this extended family history the book is still important as a reminder of the history of broken promises, terrible policies and callous, often brutal treatment that our government has subjected the Indians to over literally centuries. This personal history evokes the pain suffered by families forcably seperated, by children starved and cultural traditions trampled and in some cases even outlawed!"
3,"Quick, concise, and easy to understand","A very fast read. I bought this book as suggested by one of my professors. Within a few short reads I had a web page up and running. That web page has already won several awards. The book is a little lean and tends only to cover the need to know basics. Ideal for the beginner, too plain for the pro."
2,Needs Updating More Frequently,"I loved the previous edition of this book and used it daily in my work as a medical transcriptionist. I bought this edition expecting the same experience, but I've been really disappointed. I only find what I'm looking for about 20% to 25% of the time. I think it could be an excellent reference but as frequently as new products, equipment and procedures come along, updating should be done more often."
5,The Surgical Word Book Third Edition,"Shipped fast, in perfect condition. I recommend this book for anyone in the medical transcription field, it is a must!!!!!"
4,Learned a lot,"I have never read such a small book with so many BIG words! I had to have a dictionary for almost every page. That said, I did enjoy learning about Hebrew language and symbols and how the original Adamic language gave Holy meanings to words. The authors point out some of the mistranslations in the Bible when ancient Hebrew is used. I find it interesting that so many names of places and peoples originate from the founders or have reference to Deity. Some examples are: Denmark means field of Dan. Nevada - we will serve Jehovah. Idaho - the hand of Jehovah creates. Alaska - the fire of God is like Jehovah. And Hawaii - behold, Jehovah is to come. I underlined a lot and made notes in the margins on most pages. This is a book I'm sure I will refer back to."
5,Go figure,"I purchased the Eagle Claw Starfire Rod for my wife and this year she used it for the first time and caught a 21 inch rainbow trout with in just a few short minutes of being out on the boat. She said she love's the Rod, gave her great action. I've been showed up by a new Rod."
4,Works Very Well,"I've used this product before and was quite pleased to find it on Amazon. My previous experience with this product was from 3-4 years ago before I discovered Amazon. It works really well although the smell is not the most pleasant. Based of the fact the the active ingredient is a sulfur compound, this is to be expected. If you've tried the other OTC remedies for your dandruff or sebhorreic dermatitis and have had less that good results, or if you want to avoid that frustration, try this product. I'd seriously doubt whether there is a better product that is avaialble without a prescription."
5,Medicine for the Hair,"Glover's Dandruff Medicine is what a aspirin is to a headache; it causes dandruff to lessen over time. This is how I use it, I pretreat my scalp with Glover's, let it soak in for about an hour then I shampoo and condition my hair. Works wonders."
1,Didn't live up to expectations,"My kids were so excited to have this toy. But that was BEFORE using it. They were discouraged by the fact that it fell apart easily and that the treats also fell apart. One package of marshmellow mix made four treats. Considering the package came with four marshmellow mixes, I'm wondering how much these little treats are going to end up costing us once we need to buy more mix. This is definately not worth the huge mess it made. Making rice krispy treats on the stove is much easier!"
2,Don't buy this toy!!!,"My daughter(5) had some money, and thought this looked like the neatest toy! We used it only once, as it was very lame. The Rice Krispie Treats fell apart, and so what is the point of making them. It is much easier to make real Rice Krispie treats in the microwave. It was hard to clean the pieces too. Save your money- buy something else!"
2,Don't waste your money,"We used this twice, and each time the end result was inedible. Although others have written that it is a mess, this was not the point of contention. We followed the instructions to the letter and came up with a nicely formed but awful tasting snack. I am a fan of Easy Bake, but this product falls very short. I would urge you not to waste your (or your child's as in our case) money."
4,Great Step Up from Toy Food to Real Food for Little Chefs,"My middle son has wanted to be a chef since age 2. After several Xmases of toy food & dishes, this year we went with the Rice Krispies Treats Factory. Of course, he found it and begged to try it! Clean up was sticky & required lots of scrubbing, & the treats were crumbly (but DID hold their shape), but my son loved ""cooking"" & decorating the treats. Good thing mix refills are readily available at Toys R Us, and are gelatin free for the vegetarians out there. Don't know what the complaints are about -- adult supervision & enthusiasm are key; age of the child, also, perhaps? My son is 6 and managed this toy without problems just fine. A great step up from toy food for kids not yet ready to work in the kitchen."
2,Adjustable Reading Lamp,"Product was not made very well. The bottom part was not glued together properly so that the top was out of alignment with the bottom. Also, the mechanism for keeping the lamp in a certain postiion broke (cheap plastic) and now the lamp will not stand up without having to lean against a wall - not a good situation. We know longer use it at all. Would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Smaller than I thought,"These clay cutters are truly darling! However, they are much smaller than I thought they would be! The largest cutter is appoximately 1.75 inches tall, the medium cutter is just under 1 inch and the smallest is about .75 inches. I was going to use the smallest cutter for earrings, but it is nearly impossible to tell that it is a snowman. The medium size is marginal. I used the larger cutter to make a pin. I used texture sheets to decorate the snowman with snowflakes, cut out a hat with the cutter and decorated it with the star texture sheet and then embellished. It came out very well. The other two just don't seem very worthwhile."
5,Karnes City Representer,I like to rate this CD good because one of the rappers is my childhood friend. I'm also looking to get into the music business but I need alittle help getting started.
5,A remarkable book,"This book is a remarkable testimony to the reality of synchronicity and contains some wonderful examples of it in action. As one who has had many such events in my life, I can attest to the eerie way synchronicity works. In fact, simply through reading Deike's book, it has unleashed a chain of events in my life that is changing it forever.I also have had an astrological reading carried out by Deike and she has given me some truly uncannily accurate insights into my life.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about this fascinating subject. Deike is a very talented lady and I wish her every success."
5,In/Out Board,"The in/out board system is great for a smaller office - when people remember to sign in and out! It's a nice size, lightweight and hangs easily on the wall with velcro."
4,Small but Effective,"The board is small, but effectivley has space for up to 16 employees. The pen doesn't work on the board, and it didn't come with any kind of eraser, so you have to use a kleenix or you finger to clean it every time someone does try to use the pen."
2,Reception...intermittent at best,"This is a universal satellite radio antenna (universal in the sense it will work with either Sirius or XM satellite car radios).I had to replace my antenna for my Sirius satellite radio as the cord had cracked and was no longer acquiring a signal. This XM version was the only one available at the store I was at, so I bought it, realizing that the antenna for XM and Sirius (now that they have joined companies), was interchangeable.The antenna fit perfectly into my satellite radio, however, the reception of this antenna was inferior to the reception to my previous Sirius antenna. The 'bars', indicating signal strength, are usually only 1 out of 3 (rarely 2) and the signal, frequently cut out, even in very 'open-sky' areas.Conclusion:The reception was unreliable and sporadic. I would not buy this brand of antenna again.Ray Nicholson"
2,American International XM-2SAA XM Roof-Mount Antenna,Cancelled my XM. Went through 3 antennas in one year
3,"Well written, but too dark for my taste.","I love Ms. Roberts' ""Amanda Pepper"" series, and I found Time and Trouble a disappointment.Neither Emma nor Billie were sympathetic or interesting. The balancing humor that appears in the prior series is missing here making the book too dark for my taste.I didn't think that Emma was very well drawn. Little was told about her except for giving her age and showing that she didn't get along with anyone. As for Billie, her home life is depressing and too often used in books, the woman struggling to find a job and support her child.If this series is to work for me, it will have to be a more pleasant read. Will I try the next in the series? Certainly, but I'm hoping that some of the wit of the prior series will come into this one. -- Pat Bird"
1,Too many coincidences to be believable.,"It's too bad Gillian Roberts wasn't more creative in starting this second series of mysteries. The premise of a veteran hard-bitten woman PI and the eager, beautiful young student isn't too bad. The three plot lines concerning an old mystery, a current kidnap, and an insurance investigation just overlap way too much to be believable or realistic."
4,Here are the 15 songs,1- Loch Lomond2- St. Patrick's Day3- The Campbells Are Coming4- My wild Irish Rose5- The Wearing Of The Green6- Sweet Rosie O'Grady7- My Bonnie8- Coming Through The Rye9- Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes10- Auld Lang Syne11- The Kerry Dance12- The rose Of Tralee13- I'll Take You Home Again14- Cockles & Mussels15- Annie And Laurie
2,Cheap,"Build one yourself, it's easy. The cup below it that holds the fluid is way to small, doesn't last long even with a low flame."
3,Good but not great!,Frank was such a great Trombone player and this is an excellent CD but not as inspiring as I had hoped for. Perhaps part of it is due to the quality of the recording.
2,because the singers and the director arent good,I think this author gluck is intrepeted better by Solt
2,don't waste your money,ok sample test however there is only one so it was certainly NOT worth my $10 plus shipping. spend your money on another brand's practice guide instead
2,Many better books.,Buy Siegel's book instead. Or Lynda's. This one just isn't up to their standards.
1,Is there a proofreader in the house?,"Fluffy content aside, I've *never* seen a book riddled with so many typographical and editorial errors. Worst are the inaccurate URLs and ""page to come"" spaceholders that were never replaced with the actual page numbers. How did this book get published in this condition?"
3,"Pleasant to read, but two years out of date","I was impressed by the organization and clear layout of this book, but if you're looking for anything beyond the basics, find something a little more up-to-date."
5,Simply the best introduction to web design you can find.,"A great introduction to the entire act of creating a web site. Deals as much with the process of design as with specific code techniques. Waters does a great job introducing traditional design theory and adapting it to the web. Her treatment of the ideation phase is the best I have seen. This book is a ""must read"" for any new web designer and a good brainstorming tool for more experienced designers."
2,"Pool of Radiance was good, Pools of Darkness sucked","while i loved pool of radiance (the first FR novel I read) pools of darkness was a big disappointment. The combat scenes are similar to, but much less interesting than Bob Salbatore's and the novel lacks an interesting plot. The entire city of Phlan is kidnapped and Ren has to go look for it."
1,Single worst book I have ever read.,"I was always a big fan of the Forgotten Realms series, but thought the novelisation of Pool of Radiance(one of my alltime favourite games) was terrible.This book goes beyond terrible.The introduction has the supreme lord of evil blasting his minions with comicbook sound-effects *zzzzapppp!* *pow-eeeeww!* until one of his cohorts tells him, in what appears to be a Brooklyn accent, that he has to 'show them bums' (I'm not making this up) the extent of his true power. What follows is a collection of wretchedly concieved, poorly written cliches twisted into a vague semblence of a plot that is largely implausible even in a fantasy universe. I gave up reading the book after forcing myself to halfway.Pure garbage."
4,I think it's a pretty good book!,"This was the first 'FR' book I read and I thought it was pretty good over all. It has a good cast of charactors and they are easy to like. If you are like me and did not read 'Pool of Radiance' first, then you still will be able to very easily follow this book when you read it. This book goes at a good pace. The fights are OK, I like how the characters are not always put in a fight were it's always a hundred to one and they still some how amazingly come out on top with little more then a small bump on there heads. If you are new to fantasy or are an old pro and don't need to worry about every last detail of a book to enjoy it then I would say that this is a good book to read."
3,Highly enjoyable,This was one of my earliest fantasy reads and I got through it faster than I had ever read a book! The first chapter is one of my favourite opening chapters of all time. Although I have'nt read the first book I found the characters in this one very likeable. Pools of darkness I think is a classic example of good traditional high fantasy. Read it if you have too much spare time.
3,Not intended for heavy duty kitchen vent,"the angle between the top cover and the vertical cross sectional is less than 45 degrees, soair flow is going to be restricted. compared to this, the broan 641 has a curved top cover, soair flow turns direction much more easily."
4,Great for sensitive dogs,We have shar-pei and they have all kinds of skin issues. This shampoo was gentle enough and we did not have any itching afterwards. They have had reactions to many shampoos but this one is soothing and wonderful. Very happy with it.
2,It didn't work,My Pekingese gets seasonal itch and I have always gotten him a shot during the hot seasons but this year I moved and have not gotten a new vet so I ordered this product but it did not work..he itched before he dried..darnit...
3,Cute but tiny,"Very cute statue of a Bichon Frise, b ut small. The 8"" height is given. Guess I didn't think about just how small that would look out on the front yard! Again, it's the cutest one I've seen, but for the price I think it should be closer to real size of a Bichon, so passers by would have to wonder if it's real or not. THAT would be fun!"
5,DEG Trombone Slide Saver Pair,"This does a great job protecting the bars of my slide. Although I'm still very careful, these are always on my slide of primary trombone for safe keeping. I personally feel that I made a pretty wise decision on purchasing these and putting them on my slide. Not every trombonist does this, or recomends it, infact not a whole lot of trombonists uses or recommends this, at least the ones I know of and play with. But if any trombonists out there would want to have less worries on getting dents or nicks on their slide, this would definently be your best bet."
1,Very Comfortable but Poor Quality,"I wore these slippers for about one week. One morning while wearing them, my right foot felt like the material inside the shoe was twisted. I looked down at the shoe to see what the problem was, and much to my surprise, part of my foot was hanging out the side of the slipper! The seam had split where the top and side were stitched together. Very disappointed!"
1,My Husband's Christmas Present- Sorry Honey !,I bought these slippers as a present for my husband for Christmas. I can't return them because he wore them for a day. These slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers. The shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left. Don't waste your money.
3,Hard to find these slippers in wide widths,A year later and we are still quite pleased with the purchase of these slippers. I ran all over town trying to find shearling suede moccasins in a wide width. What a waste of time! We did purchase a pair (at a local store) first and they promptly fell apart. The Tamaracs from Amazon are still going strong and now I know where to find replacements as needed.
5,An important and well researched book.,Anyone interested in the history and ethics of human experimentation in the U.S. should read this book. Moreno is a careful scholar and a good writer who knows how to choose important and interesting examples.
4,Hard To Understand And Makes One Remorseful In The End!,"Jonathan d. Moreno has written a catalogue of biological horrors that is regrettable but a necessary publication to inform the public. Although much of it has been published through historical and governmental sources the author makes you wonder why such experiments are required. On the other hand, is there another way to benefit the many at the cost of the few? Is there a way one can inform the subjects who volunteer for such assumptions of risks? I'll leave it to you to decide. What is frightful is just how easy a biological attack can occur on anyone, at anytime and anywhere. Very disconcerting but necessary for being forewarned to defend."
1,how dare you,"Mr. Moreno I am appauled that you would publish this account.In my opinion as the daughter of a victim of this horrific practice I can not imagine that you have any grasp on this subject.Your subject matter seems to be, in my opinion, obtained from Eileen Welsome. I find it very sad that for some reason you need to obliterate the sanctity of humanity from your daily life.I wonder if you would be so sanctimonius (sp)in your ""opinions"" (as opposed to facts) if these victims were you or your family.And, if that would be O.K. with you than why have you not subscribed to donate yourself or family members to science? Or better yet; subscribe yourself to plutonium injections as we speak?Katie Kelleydaughter of Cecil Kelley"
5,OUT OF DATE? MY HOOF!,"I read the previous reviewer's comment that this book was out of print because it's photos are out of date. It made me SO MAD that I went and pulled my copy off my bookshelf (I'm 32 and bought a copy of the book when I was in college since I'd loved it so much as a kid)just to see how out of date the photos were. Not a one! Other than the fact that Vivi was wearing Adidas...I mean really, she even had her harness on her helmet! If there are any publishers out there reading this, this one needs to come back!"
5,A Very Young Rider - book,"I read this book as a child so often that my copy fell apart. It was out of print for a while, but now it's back and it's wonderful! There is an update on the family and the horses. If you have a child or were a child that loves horses, you must have this book!"
3,Ho hum,"I found this book to have a decent amount of discussion on channel and source coding, baseband and CDMA modulation and demodulation. But NO echo cancellation or DMT and a few paragraphs on channel equalization!?! This book is very readable if you are looking for some fundamentals and common topics, but it's also missing some important stuff. OTOH, I'd really recommend Lee&Messerschmitt's Digital Communication if you need a great reference book."
3,"Good, but not as good as the earlier books...","I enjoyed this but not as much as the other Little House books. She really made me want to go out and live on a farm and be self sufficient. Her praises of farm life definitely come from the heart. I liked how she made the point that farmers wives are already ""liberated"" when at the time women's liberation was picking up steam. She also gave some household tips that would probably also apply today."
2,Balance Needed Here,"This series has swung from Disney to Grimm Brothers. The early fuzzy-bunny books were ""charming"" to the point of cloying, but if I have to choose one style or the other, I'll take the Disney style over the grimness of this book. I could not bear to read of the herds and flocks being destroyed. Bad enough it was all over the news; do I have to find it in my escape reading also? I'm going to be very careful about any Rhys Bowen purchases in the future, instead of treating her works as virtually auto-buys."
2,Evan only knows,"I started reading this series with the first book, I liked them because they caught your attention at the very beginning and were well crafted. However, I do not like this one. It is too dark and depressing. I read as an escape and to relax, this book was not relaxing. I put it down several times and almost did not finish it. The main character's personality changed from considerate towards his neighbors and fiancee to selfish and his own goals. I have read all the good mysteries, Christi, James, Sayers etc. I thought I had found a winner but am not sure I will read anymore of this series."
4,Good old fashioned Welsh read,"I've read all the Evan books and they're sweet, old fashioned and relaxing reading. This one set in Swansea is different as the North and the South of Wales is different from each other in sensibility. The North took longer for the English to conquer than the South and is seen as more Welsh; the Welsh language is also more part of the culture in the North. This Evan book was similar to the rest and is a pleasant read."
1,Be careful,"I take partial blame for my dissatisfaction with this book. I should have been suspicious with the following wording in the description: ""This book is a replica, produced from digital images of the original. It was scanned at the University of Toronto Libraries and may contain defects, missing pages or blemishes due to the original source content."" I had no idea that there would be more than 10 or 20 missing pages. When it arrived, I discovered to my dismay that it was only a small portion of the book: just the paradigms! So while I am willing to assume some responsibility for my disappointment, I would advise Amazon to make it clear in the description that this is only a VERY small portion of the book, and specifically ONLY the paradigms. If you want the majority of the book, which contains all the description of the language, you must buy the far more expensive versions listed."
3,An Acquired Taste,"Although Professor Perlowin's arrangement of Stravinsky's Firebird suite is effective, the rest of the album becomes a test of my endurance. I admire his mastery of the instrument, and it's a noble effort, but I'd recommend listening to this in small doses. It's the audio equivalent of RoboTrippin'.On the other hand, I notice that music from this recording has been used in the 2008 cartoon series ""Jack Clum, Dream Detective"" drawn by the celebrated artistRobt. Williams,so I may be wrong. People with more discerning tastes than mine apparently think highly of the artistry of Michael Perlowin."
5,Loved it...,"Absolutely loved this novel, the third in a series whose titles refer to cards in the Tarot Deck. The protagonist amateur sleuth is an ex-Weather Underground fugitive who assumes fake identities and reads cards on Telegraph in Berkeley. The plot to ""The Star"" involves family members of the man: his deceased father's ex-lover shows up with a family secret while his bipolar daughter involves him in a murder investigation. It's all very genial without being corny. It's also fast-paced, funny, and original. Will appeal to anyone who has an affection for the fringes of the counterculture."
2,Didn't work well for me!!,"While this splitter appears to be well made, there was noticable deterioration of the signal quality to the attached devices, compared to single device without the splitter. I am not willing to completely blame this product, since other splitters caused similar problems; perhaps I will need to purchase an RF amplifier to solve the issue. It just didn't work well in my situation."
5,Well made product,I was concerned that splitting the signal 4 ways would degrade the picture quality but this device worked perfectly and without any signal loss. I use this to split a DVD player onto 4 tvs in my shop and I'm very happy with the results.
5,"Classic footage, great music","This superb 3-DVD set contains all the half-hour TV episodes from the mid-1960's WGBH-produced survey of music composed in the 1920's, written and hosted by Aaron Copland. His wry and informative analysis of the many musical developments during this decade is reinforced by in-studio performances that serve as superb illustrations of a particular composer and/or trend. The performances feature a great Boston-based pickup band that is joined by a famous guest performer or soloist. This classic footage of the many well-known performers, as well as Mr. Copland's conducting (in fine mid-60's form) is invaluable.For curious musicians, this is a major historical document, and well worth the price."
2,An Historical Account,"Mead's book provides an outstanding historical perspective of U.S. foreign policy but lacks rigourous analysis. Mead divides U.S. foreign policy into four schools. Despite his disclaimers, he simply renames realism, idealism, libertarianism, and populism as Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jeffersonian, and Jacksonian, respectively. His contention is that all four schools represent unique U.S. foreign policy strategies; however, Jeffersonian and Jacksonian schools simply are not convincing as strategies but as schools of thought that temper realism and idealism. Get this book for the historical account."
2,Poorly written and edited,"I was disappointed by the poor organization of the text, which often repeats itself and spends pages explaining little that is new or important. Also disappointing is the lack of detailed analysis of specific instances of US foreign policy successes and failures. Instead, the author alludes briefly to various historical incidents to support his argument that US foreign policy has succeeded brilliantly and, thus, has been underappreciated for its genius. There is too little detail to know if the author's right."
1,Opaque keypad cover,"One sleeve covers the screen area; that's fine. The other covers the keypad; that's not so fine. It's embossed, but it covers the keys! Even if you can remember which letters are on which keys, the embossing is inivisible in low light, which is especially frustrating given that the keypad is backlit.I used a leather punch to cut holes in the embossed area and used a small sewing scissors to enlarge them. It's an ugly solution, but at least I can see the keypad now (until I find a case that works).The case is made of a rubber-like material, which sort of sticks to fabric, making it harder to get into or out of my pocket than a leather case would."
2,surprised with one bad tape,"It comes as a 3 pack, and with the shipping charge it was a little pricey, but I went for it since T180 tapes are hard to come by now. Two of the three tapes worked just fine. Tape number three, when used right out of the box, when played back makes an annoying very audible noise. Not sure if it is the plastic reel rubbing inside the cassette, or the tape rubbing. Very annoying and got to the point that after rewinding and trying it again several times, I just stopped using it. So the 3 pk became a 2 pk, and made my cost even higher. Expected better."
1,NOT PLEASED,"Tapes didn't work at all -- none of them. I had had good luck with ordering the 8 hour tapes, so thought it would not be a problem to order 9 hour tapes. That was a mistake."
1,Watch out!,"Let me start by saying I know it is not my recorders. I have tapes I have been using regularly, some for 10-15 years. Because the quality of many was starting to fade, I decided to buy a few replacements. The first go-round everything taped and played beautifully. The second round there was reduced quality and the tapes appeared to be sticking/sluggish. With the third round now the quality of the recording is low and the tape is sticking -- the player sputters and ejects the tape. I'm annoyed that I have wasted my money...but even more so since it appears I will have also lost the recordings as well.I will never buy Maxwell video tapes again."
1,defective tapes/nasty response,"these people sent me tapes that :wouldn't rewind while on playhad lines across pictureI only have 3 that I could keep and they cannot be rewound while on play. I just have no choice but to use them because they are all I have at the moment.All my other tapes are fine.When I complained to them, they said that they had sold thousands of these tapes and no one but me ever complained so it was obviously the fault of my vcr.It was not.They were rude and wrong and I can't afford to throw away most of what I buy .Can Amazon recommend a blank vcr company that will stand behind it's product??Because I really need more tapes.I realize that possibly Maxell standard grade tapes are no good."
1,Dubeat-E-O,"First of all Joan Jett does NOT star in this film. There is footage of an unrealeased movie in which a teenaged Joan was in. it has been a while since I have seen this film, however I do remember the let down. If your a Joan Jett fan just know she had nothing to do with this film or it's making."
5,Just as expected,Purchased these hinges for an interior door project and they were just as expected. Good quality and good price.
4,Pretty awesome,I like the center folds. There could have been a few more cross sections available which is why I dropped a star.
2,4 cup coffee maker,"I needed a 4 cup coffee maker in white. There are very few 4 cups available in white. The coffee maker itself gets very dirty inside and the carafe's lid does not fit very tightly when you pour the coffee. When pouring, the coffee leaks from the carafe, no matter how tightly the lid is held and how high the carafe is held to the cup."
2,Has a couple of design problems,"As the previous reviewer stated, I was also initially impressed with this coffee maker: it makes a decent cup of coffee. However, two things about this coffee maker are quite annoying, so much so that if I had kept my receipt and the box, this would be going back to the store. 1. If the grind of the beans is too fine, the water backs up in the filter after the brew should be completed. 2. The carafe will spill coffee all over your counter top about every time you go to pour a cup, unless you use your thumb to hold down the plastic lid and then you can easily burn yourself from the steam. My advice: avoid this coffee maker."
3,average,"This little coffeemaker looks nice in its space, and makes good coffee due to slow drip, however, the carafe is very difficult to pour from without spilling on the counter. Coffee is generally hot. I would not recommend unless you are intent on buying only a 4-cup."
2,Good Coffee...impossible to keep clean,This unit makes quite good coffee and the design is very attractive. However cleaning it is very time consuming and frustrating.
5,Best Pencil Ever,"That pencil is very cool, since it looks like a pen you can trick all your friends. THAT PENCIL ROCKS!!!"
1,Hard to read,I can't believe that the topic can't be written in a friendly way. No surprise that there's only one edition so far. The book is really boring.
4,Old time country,"I had never heard Chester Smith before this CD, but I am really impressed with his singing, and particularly his guitar playing. Merle is in wonderful voice, and ""grace for the shepherd"" makes this an essential purchase for hard-core Haggard fans (like me!)Six cuts are Chester solo, four are duets with Hag, and two are Merle solo (""grace for the shepherd"" and ""after we go to guns"" (which may suprise some people - ""after we go to guns, it will be too late, isn't there something else we can advocate? A few more peaceful sundays lord, a few more days to wait, 'cause after we go to war it will be too late."" It's wonderful to see that Merle continues to be unpredictable and is always evolving as a person and artist). This is real old time country, with shades of Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Johnny Cash etc. Anyone who enjoyed Merle's albums ""Cabin in the hills"" and ""Two old friends"" will certainly like this."
4,Funny and good!!!,I really enjoyed this book-and I'm looking forward to reading more! Can anybody tell me the order in which these books have been written? I really don't want to skip any of them and miss any of the continuing story lines with Kevin and Riley!!
3,a light mystery,this book was more about friends & family with a mystery in it. the characters vascillated between silly & sensible. nina lies & can be coy. i think the author tried to be whimsical but it didn't come off for me. found myself skimming to the end. the plot was pretty good. will try one more of her books but will read the reviews first.
3,Another martial arts film,"Before Kung Fu and Karate during and after world war II Jiu-Jitsuwas the Japanese fight technique kids wanted to learn; sort of fullcontact judo is the way it was described to me in the 60's.It is sort of the moves of Judo with some boxing added.In this movie a black belt is set up to take a fall; a cop, hisbest friend is framed and kills himself in shame.As in most of these movies he finds a way to win against the odds.Aikido is the newer version of this sort of art as I understand itas the philosophy of using an attacker's energy against him.In eastern philosophy the best fight is one that you don't have to have..."
1,This is a Really Bad Movie,"This movie sucked. It was horrible. If your expecting A movie about A fight league with lots of fighting, good actors, picture, and fixed fights. Then this is defenitally not your movie.The actors in this film were horribleThe plot in this film was borring, and it dragged way too muchThere wasn't near enough fight schenes in it (only like 3 with only one involving the main charector (Mike Terry (played by a cheap actor who I could care less about)This movie had about the worst picture quality I'd ever seenThe sound quality in this movie wasn't good at allAnd I could tell this movie was way too low budget.Don't waste your time watching this piece of crap movie. If you wanna see a good fighting movie, then just rent the first Blood Sport."
5,movie review,The film isn't your usual karate kid story but it's about someone who lives by the code of the martial art he teaches. The conflict in the story comes between himself and his wife who wants to make a quick buck. I dont want to give more of the story away but its a wonderful film by writer/director David Mamet.
5,Another Good Mamet flick!,"Another Good flick from Director/writer Mamet! In the spirit of Spartan, Ronin, and The Spanish Prisoner Mamet once again weaves a plot and story that makes you both question what you know and what you think you know. Buy it! later!"
2,David Mamet chews the screen.....,"with over wrought dialogue and ridiculous characters - over blown, over directed, and over written to the extreme! This is what happens when a mediocre playwright gets a camera and a big budget - not worth your attention - what a waste! Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog is way better in every way - now there is a filmmaker!"
5,A Needed Gem,"Wow! Wow! Morality, honesty, integrity, and decency flowed from our main actor like rarely seen in movies or life. What a magnificent movie! Every human being should see it. Your living could improve by taking note of Mr. Ejiofor's great qualities."
2,Review of Red Belt,"Dont waste your time, I had hoped it would be a great movie but sadly its a huge letdown.The acting was cheezy and the whole storyline never got off the ground."
5,Please check to where my stuff?,"Let me know that what happning to my order.I still waiting my stuff,since 1 month ago.noriko taira"
2,A disappointment,"I like Egan's work and don't generally mind it when he gets technical (e.g., as he did, ferquently, in Diaspora), but this books often seems to be little more than characters talking physics and mathematics to each other.To be sure, there's a lot of intruiging asides about the culture and the technology of his universe, and the main character does have a *bit* of a backstory, but the sheer amount amount of technical detail that gets thrown around (often with minimal explaination for us mere mortals) has the unfortunate effect of muting a story with an absolutely intruiging premise.Egan clearly knows his science and his math, but he can get carried away. I wish that he had toned these aspects down a bit and had focused more on the characters and the plot, especially since I know that he's quite capable of telling a good story on those terms, as well."
3,more quantum gibberish,"Ever since the photon/two slit experiment and hugh everetts'many world's theory,science fiction writers have had a fieldday with speculation. But Egan's looped nodes of QuantumGraph Theory present gibberish as plausible fact. I can seethe possiblity of thorne's quantum foam and the delectablenonsense of schrodingers cat, but overlapping nodal quantumgaphs as a foundation of all reality? Come on! Egan should concentrate more on fiction and less on quantum speculationor people will start drying puddles in their basements by standing over the puddle and reading this book alound.The whole book was a chore to read."
4,Celtic Ladies 3 cd in collector tin,"If one likes Celtic (Irish) type music then they will like the Celtic Ladies Christmas music. I have several of the Celtic Women's cd's, and have seen them in person....and this group of celtic ladies, rates real close to the Celtic Woman..It's great Christmas music, and I listened to all of them the other day when the temp. was 100 degrees, and I just can't wait until Christmas time.....and it did (in my mind), cool me off)......"
3,Brennan: Enemy of Liberty,"Brennan acted with breathtaking intellectual arrogance and contempt for the American people. Most of his ""achievements"" have already been exposed as failures -- affirmative action (government-sponsored racial discrimination),supression of religous expression (I'm an agnostic, by the way, but I don't enjoy the Court's meddling with expressions of religious views) and the famous Roe vs. Wade decision which, by imposing a ""solution"" that should have been debated by society, created one of the most destructive and polarizing arguments of recent times and may ultimately lead to more restrictions on abortion than would have otherwise been imposed. As one who favors choice, I would have preferred to have had the opportunity to persuade my fellow Americans, rather than having theoutcome dictated by an arrogant, Napoleonic pipsqueak who lingered among us far too long.Sincerely,Denis ArvayARVAY@IBM.NET"
3,"OK, but no bargain","Recently I purchased a Medline rolling walker from Amazon and was amazed at the quality of the merchandise and the value represented by its price. This week I needed to purchase a wheelchair and I mistook ""MedMobile"" for ""Medline"", the largest supplier of wheelchairs to hospitals. The vendor is listed as ""Good Deal Hunting"" but as you check out of Amazon the vendor changes to ""Prestige International Trading"". That should have been a clue. When we received the item it had been shipped from ""A-Wholesale"" in Miami Gardens, FL and had been imported from China.I probably got my money's worth but this wheelchair is no bargain. It is more crudely made than the Medline product. I do not know how reliable it will be over the long run. If someone were going to live in the wheelchair, I would suggest you invest in a better product."
5,Great chair,We love this chair. The side panels are a big help in keeping an oxygen tank from rolling out. The leg rest strap is also a plus that many chairs we looked at did not have. We paid a little more for this chair but it was well worth it.
4,Haven't actually seen in myself,"Needed a wheelchair ASAP for elderly grandparents. Needed to be light and easy to use. Grandpa says it's just that. Grandma says it's attractive. Most importantly, I paid $75 for urgent shipping, it made it there in 5 days (I think it was promised in 3-5 business days). Not sure whether it would have taken the same amount of time w/out the extra delivery fee, but pleased all the same."
2,Where's Tori?,"To Venus and Back is the last album I accept as a true Tori Amos album. 1,000 Oceans was only the beginning of the end of my true claim to being a Toriphile. The Beekeeper sounds like Scarlet's Walk which, in my opinion, was simply boring in parts which is completely unlike the red headed Goddess I grew up adoring. I understand she's in different place but where are songs like datura, rasberry swirl, not the red baron, suede, sugar, etc etc that sent chills down the spine of the listener. Where'd the passion go?"
5,I must see the beekeeper,"Well well, the beloved Tori has done it again! Definately her best release since From the Choirgirl Hotel, I was VERY please with this release. 19 tracks, all wonderful and makes for a listening time of almost an hour and a half. The concept is pure genius, as Tori explores six different emotions through six different gardens. Tori fans should be very pleased with this wonderful new release."
1,Nearly useless,"While the Taylor guide provides some useful information, such as how tall a tree may be at various ages, unless you know the latin name for the tree in question, it is nearly impossible to find anything!! Unless you're a botonist, don't buy it!"
5,Both Comprehensive and Accessible,"Undisputedly, this is the most comprehensive and accessible text on the subject. David Balaam and Michael Veseth have created a resource that is easy to understand without sacrificing the quality of the content. Introduction to International Political Economy is a thorough analysis of our modern world using the instruments of economics, politics, and sociology. Always engaging and insightful, this overview of our international community provides the reader with a foundation on which to develop their understanding of global current events."
4,Typical textbook,"This is a perfect introduction to IPE, as the title suggests. It offers thorough explanations of important IPE terms and concepts and provides interesting case studies that further expound on those terms and concepts. Chapters are lengthy, but the authors throw in unexpected references and metaphors that keep the reader's attention. For someone like me who was previously largely uninformed about IPE, this book is helpful for forming a working vocabulary and understanding of IPE."
1,worst text book ever,"really hard to follow, extremely verbose for no reason, jumps around all over the place...surely a professor can find a better text with minimal effort"
3,Well intentioned text,"This is the third different int'l political economy introductory textbook I've seen and I find it to be lacking in certain areas that it really needn't be so. Sometimes, simple things are simply fudged. It is a serviceable text and they try to hardest to keep it modern and up to date with the global financial crisis."
3,Sufficient for my needs,This box is decent but not great. Some of the tiny tabs were bent or slightly too short to get a good hold in the slots for them. Cardboard dividers in the center aren't very sturdy and bend easy. As for the good things about this is it's much bigger than I expected and was easy to assemble without the need of instructions.
5,Awesome Card storage,"This does NOT come with directions to put together! However, it really isn't that hard, it took me maybe 3 minutes to put together once I pulled everything apart. Holds top loaders perfectly which is exactly what I needed. Would highly recommend buying this item to store cards in"
3,Some oragami instructions would have helped,"Like others stated, when I saw the size of the shipping box I was expecting it to be assembled even though it was not supposed to be. Got the box itself folded ok. Then I tried the fan fold for the divider. Priding myself on being fairly analytical I was astounded how stupid I was tring to get the thing folded properly. Should have had a six year old assigned to the task. Anyway it serves the purpose I needed as a display for some items in our little church bookstore so from that standpoint it was ok. I realize that I planned on using it off-purpose so I cannot complain too much. I just wish I had paid more attention to the teacher in papercraft classes in kindergarten."
5,card box,"quick shipment and correct product, i am completely satisfied and look forward to doing more business with you, thanks A+A+A+"
4,good product,Nice storage box for someone who has a lot of baseball cards. It's nice that they come in so many different sizes.
3,A card storage box with no bells and whistles.,"This box is simple and does what its designed to do.Pros:-(Box is not preassembled, but is) Easy to assemble and uses no tape or glue.-Not a bad deal for $10Cons:-Because box comes as 5 flat pieces of cardboard, it comes shipped in a GIGANTIC BOX big enough to fit a 40"" LCD TV-Box was dirty and staples were in random places."
3,a little disappointed,"It's a box. For that purpose, it is ok and gets 3-stars.But I am a little disappointed. The box pieces come stapled together unnecessarily (in my opinion), so it starts with small holes in it. The manufacturer and/or amazon put two stickers on the ""nice"" white side of the cardboard, that don't peal off cleanly. Finally, the bottom of the box and the top of the box assemble nicely. But the three dividers that fit inside do not assemble well and do not fit well in their ""slots."" I am going to have to add tape or something to get them stay still and stay strong.For almost $10, I expected something...better?"
2,BCW Monster Storage Box - 3200ct,"The card board is very thin, therefore the dividers bend easily. Price certainly didn't represent quality on these storage boxes"
2,Not really as described,"First off, the product is NOT two pieces, but FIVE - the dividers are separate pieces. They are also, as noted by another reviewer, stapled to the unassembled box, although I didn't see the stickers that were also mentioned.Yes, I did say ""unassembled"", because the box does have to be put together. There are no instructions provided, but I was able to puzzle out that pieces of the dividers needed to be removed so that they could be properly folded and fit into the slots. Again, as already noted by others, they don't really fit that well even after that, as they are not secured at the bottom, and don't fit the entire height of the slots either.The product escapes one star only because it is at least somewhat usable, but I wouldn't put any cards you value at all in this box, as they are likely to be damaged due to the shoddy construction."
4,Refreshing!,"Once I began reading Pop A Yellow Smoke, I found it difficult to put the book down. I gained a new appreciation for our military. Chuck served in Vietnam; a place most of us cannot relate to. However, he does a great job describing his surroundings and less-than-ideal living conditions in a humorous way. His desire to reach people with the Gospel of Christ is evident. Heartily recommended!"
4,Up in the morning with the rising sun...,I use the Ranger workout as a suplimental workout. Its a good workout to get the blood flowing in the early morning but I would not rely totally on it alone. I will do the Ranger w/o or USMC Sempre fit w/o on the morning of my weight training days as a suppliment. It gets the blood flowing and revs up the metabolism. The calisthenics are at a dynamite pace so fall in and get some!
3,more helpful for pure novice golfers,"Good video for women with no golfing experience. Having never taken formal lessons I found her tips to be quite helpful. However I was disappointed in the video's lack of content for info. on club selection, strategy tips, and more on rules of the game. Also, I found the instructor's constant self-praise to be quite annoying."
5,Quick beauty resource for visitor or local,"""Head to Toe""- gives me the places to go when visiting Los Angeles - I love to come to Los Angeles and be pampered by diffrent beauty guru's from head to toe...this well organized book let's me compare people I have seen and people I want to see with the convenience of their contact information. This descriptive guide gives a visitor or local the information needed to make choices on where to get a great haircut to the best manicure in town! I can't live without it!"
3,cada dia somos mas,"""cada dia somos mas"" is a cool song, really fast and fun to dance to, as for the rest of the album, if it's anything else like the other songs i've heard from this band then it's going to be quite a corker!muchos dividido!"
5,Perfectly beautiful bluegrass Christmas album,Listened to it 3 times as soon as I got it. Love it! Totally satisfied my need for a bluegrass Christmas album.
5,Great bracelet for baby,"When I got the bracelet I was surprised to see how well it was packaged I opened it up and couldnt wait to put it on my daughter ,she wore it 3 days straight and it never fell off even though its still a little bit big for her. I love it and so happy I ordered it I will order more colors in the future because they are just that adorable"
4,Beautiful Pearls,These pearls are very nice and I gave them as a gift. I got the 5inch pearls but they measured 4 1/2 inches total with hardware. The pearls alone only measured 4inches. The seller told me they sent the 5inch. The seller did not answer my question about which age baby they would fit though.
3,very pretty but small,I love the simplicity of this bracelet it is very pretty and good for the price. If you are looking for a bracelet for a newborn this is it. I measured the lenght of my one year old's wrist but the size of this bracelet is too small when I got it. It is sitting in a drawer now.
1,cheap unreliable,"I bought 2 of these at the same time, either of them work. One of them the needle sticks at 100 when the stove is blazing. The other goes up to temp but doesnt come down so after stove pipe is cool to touch still says 400. Tried playing with them with no luck. I would recommend the Condar Chimgard Wood Stove Thermometer Magnetic, which my parrents have, well worth the extra few dollars"
1,BUY AT HOME...IT's Cheaper,"The part was OK, but the shipping cost twice as much as the part...BUY LOCAL"
1,all scratched up,"I was so disappointed I bought this as a gift for someone who bought a house at the beach and when she opened it it looked old, used and all scratched up i told her i would send it back but she was polite and said it was fine. Im sure she threw it away because you couldnt possible use it in that condition."
2,The Doors baseball cap,"This is one of the nicest, lightest caps I have had the pleasure of owning! The letters are raised on the front and back of the cap. Very well made cap.5 star cap all the way. Love the brim on this one as well."
3,Not as strong,"This album is definitely not as strong as Square Dance Messiah BUT Bisexual Military and 1,000 Volts both rock and are worth the price. There seems to be more musical experimentation here which doesn't necessarily work and they appear to have abandoned some of their flare for folky dance music. I was very disappointed in this cd, but like I said, those two songs are really good nonetheless and any Clambake fan will own this as well."
4,AN LP AND A HALF - 64 mins,"64 mins of music from two sessions in Nov 1956 for the Savoy label. Lee Morgan trumpet, Hank Mobley tenor sax, and a rhythm section led by Hank Jones. Tracks 3-6 are a 12 min. ballad medley but you can isolate the tracks if you wish. The bassist Watkins plays the first tune then Lee has the longest segment on P.S. I Love You followed by Jones on Easy Living and Mobley on That's All. Fats Navarro's- Nostalgia is the plum of the date but really should be placed elsewhere. The 5 originals aren't really memorable on first hearing but the emphasis was on strong soloing and Lee and Hank do plenty of that. Thad's Blues is more down tempoed than the others. This Was Lee's only recording for Savoy. He began his 15 yr. association with Blue Note very shortly thereafter."
4,an excellant defense against irrationalism and pseudo-scienc,"Forced to read this book in university, I found that it opened a new world of critical thought: rebutting pseudo-science, its claims and methods. A must-have for managing dinner-table conversations about alien abduction, telepathy, and so on."
4,"Flashback to Music for the ""Lunchbunch""","Super Blue was one of the solid songs played by the D.J.'s at W,O.L. radio in Wasington, D.C.. At around noon the format would change from the popular tunes of the time to an album oriented groove that shocked the system (if you were young) or cleansed the soul (if you were grown-up). Lunch time for government workers was a time to shake the hum-drum and gain and grain a sence of ""SELF"" for an hour or more. This album was a contributing factor toward that end.It was hip enough yet constrained for anyone who appreciated/enjoyed good music without freting about chord structure or improvisational..blah-blagh blagh. Freddie and company were after the dollars made by the new fans that Miles Davis had created, but in a different way. All in all, there was good music to be enjoyed by all. Thanks guys at (WWWWOOOOLLLLL) for this and other great programing back in the 70's."
3,Old Lady and a Fly...December 2000,I feel that to get kids to learning and memorizing it is a good book. I do not feel that it is a very good book because she dies but it is a fantasy. I feel that it would be a good classroom project for a teacher to do. I would recomend a teacher reading it to her classroom
1,Old book,I know this is a hard book to find but I was not expecting to purchase a book with yellowed pages that looked like it came from someone's old book case.
3,Great card unless you're using a socket7 MB,"I ordered this card and had nothing but lockups. Apparently, there are tons problems with socket7 motherboards with the ALI chipset and any of the TNT2 based video cards. Check your motherboard before ordering this card."
4,Great Price for a Great Product.,Wow what a great deal for a 32megabyte graphics processor. I reccomend it because it is #1 in PC WORLD for at least 2 months in a row. Get this awesume graphics card before it is too late.
1,Is this card really better than the voodoo 5?,"Well, is it? And if it is, then why does the voodoo cost twice as much and have more than one review? Because more people bought it because it is better. This card only supports 16 bit colour in a world that has come to love 32 bit."
5,I love it,It might offend religious fanatics but I just think the message is so kind that it's a wonderful book.
1,The True Furqan (Hardcover),This is not the Qur'an. There is only one true Qur'an and it was revealed over 1400 years ago. It contains 114 Surah's (Chapters). Amazon.com should not sell lies to people.
1,copyrighted by highest auhor the ONE creator of all mankind who sent final message of QURAN can not be duplicated by no man,"This is an attempt to mislead and distort the true message of GOD as past holy book have been distorted by man. This book is not only insult to the billions of Muslims but to all people of faith who honor and respect our Lord and would never allow anyone to take his place...If looking for the true word then the Holy Quran is the the book you seek, not this knock off being called 'furqan'."
1,True Furqan - Fake Fake Fake,"Yet another try by the miscreants to take people off the true path. If you want the true path, read the one and only Quran. Why would you want something which is a creation of man and full of discrepencies. For the 'so called muslims' who have rated this book as a must read, should really look in the mirror and realize what poison you are spreading. You 'will' be held accountable on the day of judgement.Last word - if you have already purchased it - Winter is coming - use it as fire wood."
1,Fake Immitation,This is a fake immitation of the quraan. It's a cheap attempt to mislead people to think it's real quraan. But it just tells you how the original quraan masterpiece can never be immitated.
1,Warning,"For all who are going to buy this book , this book is not the real Quraan and it has nothing to do with what Allah sent to Mohammed (PBUH) all surat are replaced with fake ones to mislead all nonmuslims. Read the Holy Qur2an , this is the only true Quraan, and is not falsificated, You can read abt all the miracles Allah made, and if you are intersted buy books for the scientific miracles in the Quraan, you will be really amazed, thanks"
1,This Is A Fake Qur'an!!!!!!!,"It Is Sad And Pathetic And Most Unfortunate That 2 Non-Muslim Companies By The Name Of 'Omega' & 'Wine Press' - Have To Get Together And Try Their Best, But Fail Miserably To Fabricate, Adulterate, Tweak And Pervert The True Word Of Allah (SWT) - (God Almighty) Our Creator.Do Not Bother Wasting Your Money On This 'Waste Of Paper'!!!The Original Word Of God - The Qur'an Is Not Hard To Find, Especially On This Website Which I Strongly Recommend The Whole Of Mankind To Purchase - For Your Own Benefit - That You May Receive Guidance - Before It's Too Late.May Allah (SWT) Punish Those Who Tempt To Change His Words."
1,Kuran?,"I donot know if the author has claimed his book as KURAN. This is a book titled ""THE TRUE FURQAN"". So I guess donot be so aggressive against him. What he has presented in this book, is his perspective and everyone has the right not to agree with him. BUT he never claimed that this is KURAN.Take care"
1,quran from ALLAH (swt),"from day one ,over 1400 years ago the non believers tried time and time again to make the quran sounds like nothings but lies , but the more they try , the more people bought it ,read it, believe it and with the Mersey of Allah become Muslims . i am a big believer that things always happen for a risen . plus the quran is protected by Allah so no worries. alhamdolillah Rabi-alaalamin.may Allah blesses all"
1,This a disgusting attempt by anti islam!!!how low could u get,"This is a FAKE book which is totally disgusting, playing with the sentiments of muslims.Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world which bothers them and hence they tried altering the words..please read THE HOLLY QURAN and then you know the real difference.What a lame book this is and And wat a LOSER ATTEMPT.No muslim can write any good thing about this book so they tried using muslim names to write good reviews about it how LAME that is, please dont think people are foolish and they can be mislead.so stop distributing this book anymore AMAZON!!! HOLY QURAN is a divine book for all and is the purest and authentic form till the end of this world! so stop this nuisence for good"
1,The honey trap,"This ""book"" is an insult to the whole concept of literature let alone islam. It is truly a disgusting attempt to deface and devalue the true teachings of islam and should be regarded as such. The only redeeming factor it has that is the paper it is written on can be recycled and reprinted on, hopefully with something with some merit."
1,New Crusade against Muslims,"I have not read the crap titled ""The True Furqan"", but I did manage to read the reviews for this book, which clearly shows the divide between the believers and the non-belivers. BE AWARE OF THIS NEW DIJAL IN FORM OF THIS BOOK. This new attempt by the non-beleivers to cast doubts in the muslim minds about Islam, is nothing new, and Inshallah, it will fail like other attempts before it."
1,Cheap Antics,"I am completely puzzled by the purpose of this book? Surely if the ""authors"" wanted to illustrate a different way of life other than Islam, then why not propogate the other ideas around? I suppose the answer is that firstly they themselves are'nt satisfied with anything other than Islam (and so keep comming back to it) and secondly since these pathetic individuals lack any form of intellect, they needed to rely upon the authentic Quran as a starting point and then change parts, so as to publish something, anything!Why do they not realise that the Quran is in our hearts and is memorised by Millions, so these cheap antics just degrade them and have no impact or effect on anyone. Complete waste of time"
1,what is this,what is this rubbish - how dare they bring this book in. There is only one true holy book which is the Holy Qu'ran. Please make sure that your children read the holy book.Allah has promised to protect this book.The Holy Qu'ran has remained unchanged since it was first written why bring this piece of rubbish for our eyes.Allah will punish the writer of this book - may they go to hell fire.
1,For those who compare,"For those who compare the true quraan with this fake one, please before you do; take a look into the meaning of the words, don't cut sentence from a paragraph and quote with, (...)"
1,The Truth,"Truth is, the writer of this book could not tell the truth, so he has to name it as 'True' and by doing so he thought he would be able to change an absolute lie into truth. Quran is the last, true and unchanged word of GOD. if some body is really interested to taste the reality of GOD's word , he/she should read the Holy Quran. Read and compare and then you feel the difference. No human being can create a single verse like Quran; and this challenge is from Allah (God) Almighty as stated in the Holy Quran."
1,disgraceful atempt to corrupt islam,"will they go any lower! may Allah have mercy on them for their punishment will be terrible and everlasting, we know the american and other anti-islamic governemnts are to blame in its ploy to change the hearts of young muslims, so be warned and warn others, and to non muslims read it if u must but it will tel u nothing of Islam but deciet and lies, read the Glorious Quran unchanged and protected since it was reveled unto the end ""it will always be protected""."
1,ALL RUBISH AND FAKE,"Please don't play with emotions of Muslims, this book is fake, already there is lots of problems and arguments going on cause of the publication of cartoon, and now this book,Govt. should take action against this book and the writer and publisher and punish them, western people are doing things against Islam and when we do something they call us terrorist.The true book is only 1 and dat is HOLY QURAN, even if they change it in book and bring books like this,Quran will never be changed cause it resides in the heart of millions of MUSLIMS and cannot be changed even the world finish.PLEASE STOP THIS NONSENSE AND AWARE PPL AROUND YOU TO STOP THIS BOOK AND MAKE UR CHILDREN READY FOR THIS THING AND NOT LET THEM READ ANYTHING LIKE THIS"
1,Why read an interpretation when you can read the real Quran?,"Lying and being deceitful is a sin in Christianity. This book is meant to confuse and detract individuals from Islam. The Quran has not changed for thousands of years. The introduction changes the basic belief of Islam and attempts to align it with the christian belief of the holy trinity. If you want to learn about Islam, read the real Quran, and not an interpretation or 'updated version'."
1,This is not the real Quran and it is Faked,"This is a faked Kuran and the enemies of Islam are trying to incorporate christianity into ISLAM, which is deadly wrong. Please do not buy this book because you are going to waist time and money. The True Furqan is a Junk and it is not worth it to read it because you will be misled. I would not even consider give it a one star"
1,A FAKE QURAN,THIS IS A FAKE QURAN END OF STORY. GO GET A REAL QURAN FROM YOUR LOCAL MOSQUE IF TRUELY INTRESTED THIS IS A PHONEY BOOK.
1,Not the Quran,"After reading this, I came accross several instances where it deviated completely from the real Quran. i.e. the begining of the chapters it starts off with something that is contradicting to the original Quran. There are many teachings that are not from the original Quran. If you want to know what the Quran teaches than this will not give it."
1,Ohhh islam! a new attack,Ohh islam! everyone is attacking u & now they are trying to mislead those who wants to follow u but such lies. the right place of such book is rubbish....If u really want to know what islam is...u can buy the translated form of Holly Quaran & i am sure u will admire this religion.
1,What crap!,"Don't even waste your time or money on this book. It belongs in the garbage. If you want real poetry and real divine words, the Holy Quran is available, unchanged from the time it was revealed by Jibreel to the Prophet Muhammad (saw) hundreds of years ago. I'd also like to note that most of the positive reviews (5 stars) for this book come from people with stereotypical ""Muslim"" names and this is the only thing they've reviewed on this site or they review similar books but put the same review, promoting this garbage book. If you see a positive review for this book, just click on ""Read my other reviews."" Obviously, they were all written by people who work for the publishing company because they can't get genuinely positive reviews. They use fake Muslim names to make it seem like Muslims like this book. Nice try!"
1,haha! 1 Star for Content...5 for Laughs!,"Overall, a good effort by the publishers to try to get the word out with fake reviews...but its so obvious b/c EVERY SINGLE review that was positive was 5 Stars. Additionally, none of those 'individual' reviewers ever reviewed any other books on Amazon besides this one.Check out the names of some of the people who reviewed this book. LOL its pretty funny though ill admitDR Michael BrownProfessor of Semitic Languages....This 'professor' hasnt ever reviewed anything else...on top of that, he gets cited as a source in like 4 other 5 star givers' reviewsAbdul Ibn Kebab....kebab! hahahah!Ibn WarraqFormer MuslimIt's Really GreatMark TwainAgathaal-Qaradawi (this person also rated like 10 other real korans with 1 Star and mentioned this fake one in each of them)Aabidah HanbaliSister"
1,This is not the first time,"Well Numbers are not an issue here that everyone is worried about, it is the quality of Muslims, go back to the begging were Muslims dominated the world without numbers, but numbers also increase the chances of having some quality. This book is not the first attempt and will not be the last, ALLAH (God), has given us minds to think with and to choose right, so for those who read it and believe it be careful as the wrath of ALLAH (God) is Great and when it comes there will be no turning back and no forgiveness. So choose wisely and don't let your instincts take over your judgment. May ALLAH (God) forgive us all, Peace."
1,SO SAD!!,"It is so sad that someone feels the need to invent a new religion, but is unable to do so without using an existing one & corrupting it! This lacks originality. The truly inexcusable act is that it gives readers false facts about Islam. Then again, maybe this was the idea! I believe that God will take care of his true religion & guide those that are truly searching to it. I highly suggest avoiding such literary garbage. If you wish to read beautiful Arabic with a beautiful message, read the Quran."
1,Not the first time and it won't be the last,"Attemps of faking the Holy Quran is not a new thing; in fact it started even when Prophet Mohammad was still alive. Those who were engaged in it knew Arabic as best as it can be, yet their phony work of genius was very obvious to anyone who heard it. As for this ""masterpiece"", it is really a low and cheap attempt to imitate ""Musailamah (the liar), Sujah..."" and the other fakers of the Qura'n, however it shares their same fate of failure and disgrace."
1,Bad book for hate,"Gee!!!why so many people are moving away from Christianity to other religions? because for a religion to survive, it has to have honor, truth and based on God not on superstition. Christianity has none. Just commit a sin and accept jesus in your heart and you have direct route to heaven. So if Hitler accepted Jesus in his heart just before he died, according to christianity, he could be in heaven right now walking with Jesus. But how about the little jewish kids he put in ovens with their parents who never accepted Jesus. According to christian theology, they are in hell. so you see, Christianity is hardly a religion of justice.Now they want us to read another book of hate called the True Furqan. No thanks!"
1,THE HOLY QURAN IS THE BEST.,"The book FURQAN is totally fake & no matter how they make it intersting it is of no use.throw this book in the garbage.some people r just wasting their money & time on printing such books,but they should know that ""the holy quran"" cannot be changed.this is just a henious crime.the people who r doing this will be punished in this world or the next.there r some foolish people on this planet who r doing this but the teachings of ALLAH(azzawajal) cannot be changed."
1,misguidience,"I urge people not to read this book. This book is nothing but falsehood about Islam. Think? Why would you want to follow a new book with new changes for OUR own satisfaction ?Our Holy Quran goes back many centuries and up till now no changes. The purpose of life is to follow the Messenger of Allah and Allah's Quran, not to follow a book with new changes made by a man. If you know whats best for you , you will read the Original Holy Quran that can never be changed. Afterall there are still so many muslims in the world who will reject this new book.Those who are strong in faith and Love Allah ? Allah will surely guide them to the right path.That Path is Islam. By the Way I rate this a zero but not 1"
1,"Book not recommended, professes false information.","I have recieved notification about this book from a Muslim friend of mine. [...] It appears to be an attempt to corrupt the beliefs of what Muslims actually believe.I have read this book professes false statements customely altered towards Christian beliefs. Such a book seems to be published as a slandering tool rather than a helpful source.There are publications of the Quran and Hadiths which are valid and are translated to English. Personally, I have read and own a copy translated by Yusaf Ali. There are other translations of the Quran by translators Pickthal (i believe translated to French, then English) and Shakir. [...]As a non-Muslim myself, I would recommend not reading ""The True Furqan"" because of the deceptive and manipulative context it was created under. As can be seen, this book is causing frustration and anger. Perhaps someone will make a petition against it."
1,this is outrageous,"This is just another trick from the western world to make Islam and muslims look bad. This book should not be compared with the Holy Quran at all. Muslims and people of other religions who read the Holy Quran know and feel the true miracle out of each word. This book's language can be written by any one, these words did not come from Allah. People that write reviews like ""Joy to the World"" did are supporters of the purpose of this book and its publishers, and are against the Quran and Islam in every way."
1,False information and worse try to manipulate Quran !,"Two unauthentic publishers have tried to print the quran and tried to manipulate it in their satanic ways. Do not waste your money and time, whole thing is rubbish."
1,What's the point?,"Just wondering what are these people trying to acheive. If anyone believes in the Quran and follows it he/she is a muslim. If any one opts to follow any book like this one no matter what the title is, he/she is not a muslim. If you believe in and follow Quran you are a muslim if you dont you are not, it is as simple as that. It is time for people to respect each other and stop embarking on provocative actions. Today's world is too fragile for such actions. I'd rather read the real Quran, because I do not have lots of extra time to spend on rubbish like this one."
1,Propaganda to confuse muslims/non muslims,"This is a propaganda to defile Islam. Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. When some people cannot face this reality, they come up with books like this. Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammed(PBUH) more than 1400 years ago and not even a single word has changed since then. This is purely act of desperation from the publishers. Don't even look at this book, this should be in the garbage."
1,A dangerous trick,"The book ""The True Furqan"" is a dangerous effort to distort Islam and to revert the muslims from the right path.It has 77 surahs whereas the Quran has 114 surahs, Instead ofBismillah, each Surat begins with a longer vesion of this incorporating the Christian belief of the three spirits. And this so called Quran opposes many Islamic beliefs. In one of its ayats it describes having more than one wife as fornication, divorce being non-permissable and it uses a new system for the sharing out of the will, opposing the currentone. It states that Jihad is HARAAM. This book even goes as far as attacking Allah, Subhanahu wa Tahala!So Beware my Muslim brothers & sisters from this satanic effort from the publishers of this book."
1,it's a scam...,"This is wrong and unexeptable! You can't compare this book to the Holy Quran. All those claiming that it is better than or even close to the Holy Quran, know nothing about the holy book. Not understanding a verse is not an execuse to bash Quran. For all those having difficulties understanding the original, I suggest they go read explanation books which are available in many languages and are very easy to understand. Until then, stay away from this none sense."
2,hmmmm...,"i don't know about the rest of you, i've been reading this book online and not a single verse is like the Qur'an at all. sure, they tried to emulate the sublime language that is the Qur'an but to me this is nothing more than a book of glorified poetry. i don't think the challenge has been met at all as the verses did not instill in me with a sense of awe instead it made me snigger at the words used like fortress and Moses of Old (sounds like a fantasy book to me). and it's quite unnerving to see reviews by fellow muslims fanatically calling out for blood and vengeance. i mean, if the non believers would want to put out a book and compare it to the Qur'an and claim that the challenge has been met just let them. the only thing is, this book is in no way on the same level as the Holy Qur'an and all muslims should know that so there isn't a need for such hatred. innallaha maa sabirin."
1,Don't Recommend you buy this.,"This book does not depict the true Islam. If you want to know more about Islam, read the real Quran. Not this fake, man made version.Peace!"
1,unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!,"i cant believe some people who have the ability to even think that this thing is better than the Quran.. If any of you people are real muslims then you wouldn't even bother buying or reading this thing. this is the work of enemies who are trying to mislead muslim children or even young muslim people living in the west (these kind of kids are open to anything new) and unfortunately some of us are letting them win!!.how can you even think that this is better or even close to the real and only Quran, how can you even compare???!!!... shame on every muslim to even read this thing..."
1,What a load of...,"Please, do not spend your money on this filth. This is by far the worst book I have ever laid my eyes on. It feels like a child trying to pull out rimes without any base or structure whatsoever."
1,"Very Stupid, do not waste your time","This is really ridiculous and one of many attempts to deface the truth of the Holy Quran. The publisher thinks they would be able to change Muslims' minds and hearts by this piece of garbage. This is really stupid and shows how 'they' really naive. They wasted their money and papers actually.It is full of misspellings, typos and obscene language.This is really anti-Muslim and I urge Amazon to remove this book from their bookshelves right away."
1,This is a nonsense,This fake Book is not truly Allah's words and it is fake and unfair. If you want to read and injoy the true words of Allah and benefit from it's wisdom for the sake of your happines then you might consider to read The Holy Quran..
1,the false book,this is a false book written by evangelical Christians whose own religion has fallen apart. Read the Quraan and you will receive true guidance (for English readers read The Glorious Quraan translated by M Pickthall)
1,Sad.. and pathetic,"People sadly, often forget the one ground reality in life... which is death... they will die, and if they believe in any sort of God, they may also believe in judgement... This book is an attempt to disillusion muslims into believing that islam was wrong, and in actual fact christianity was the one true religion. It copies entire sentences and paragraphs from the quran, what is referred to as the 'poetry' here... but obviously, the word of Allah, comparing that to the word of man, is like comparing Allah to His creation... O muslims, do not be thrown off by this, and in fact, I will re-iterate.. rememeber death... remember you will be judged, and speak out against such flamboyant attempts at undermining the word of Allah..."
3,'The Arabic Bible',"This book may be highly poetic and a literary masterpiece (i'm no literary critic), but the title 'The 21st Century Quran' is a misleader, because this book has nothing to do with The Holy Quran or Islam [...]The True Furqan makes a good poem, but if we go by its contents, it would be better called 'The 21st Century Bible' or 'The Arabic Bible' or as it's own author describes it, 'a tool of evangelism' ."
1,It's fake,"Hello,This ""book"" is completely fake. It was likely created by people trying to spread the wrong word about Islam. This thing deserves 0 stars xD since it is trying to mislead people about Islam, which is a great religion!!! I'm sure there are other ""fake"" and misleading books too"
1,This is PURE LIE,How come Amazon can allow people or a group sell books that are complete LIE and can harm the society in general?
1,IS NOT AlQuran. Get the Real ALQURAN.,"This book draws upon ""arabic/ and style of ALQURAN"" however is not AlQURAN. Who ever is behind this cannot have good intentions towards AlQURAN.ALQURAN is the last book from ALLAH SWT, Owner and Ruler of ""all universes"" HIS WILL BE DONE. AMEN.HE has guaranteed protection to ALQURAN till the day of the Judgement.If You are going to spend your time to learn something - read the real ALQURAN.The Qur'an (Quran, Koran, Al-Qur'an). Translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali. (mobi)Thanks"
1,A shame for every christian that wont condemn such cheap work,I thought we should elevate truth in this world ! What happened ?! is this the level we reached at !
1,This book has no point,"Such a book is of no use. The real Holy Quran is not just a piece of poetry like this one is assumed to be. It is a light sent to humankind; a guidance that's inspired by Allah (God in Arabic) and guaranteed to lead to happiness in this life and in the hereafter. It is 100% compatible with modern science and even miracleously explained some scientific facts centuries before it was time for them to be discovered by scientists. Quran is the only book that after 1400 years is still kept and recited in exactly the same way it was recited by the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him."
1,This is a pile of bull,"What is wrong wit u people?! Can't u face the fact that islam is the true religion and nothing can change it. no matter what kind of attacks that you do on islam, you will always fail. islam will bring peace back to the world again! inshallah!!!!"
1,please read this before you buy!,"If you're thinking of buying this book, you might as well through your money outta the window, because this book isn't worth it...unless you want to encourage spreading out lies. This book reflects nothing but hatery to Islam, is this what you're intend to learn from this book? Hatery? There's only one ""Furquan"", and there's no such thing as a ""true"" or a worong one!! May Allah witness that I tried to warn you...Thank you!"
1,This is not the book you want to read for information on Islam.,"As-salaam-u-alaikum,It does not represent the truth of Islam. If you are looking for the truth read ""The Holy Quran"". It has remained unchanged since it was first revealed. Brothers and Sisters we must ensure that Islam remains unchanged. It is our responsibility to practice the religion the way Allah wants us to. We should follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (SAW), not any form of a transgression. Inshallah may we all remain steadfast. Allah knows best as to what is true and what is false in this world, but we should strive to uncover the truth in everything and this book does not represent the truth!"
1,"fake quran, i dont understand why this was printed",seems like an attack on the religion of islam and a deliberate attempt to twist its message.
1,Fake Quran.,The only true book on earth is the holy Quran . Your book is an only fake book. You will not succeed . Allah promised to keep his book saved till the last day. For non Muslim beware this is a fake Quran.
1,Waste of Time...,Do not watse a penny on this item...it is not even written by Muslim and they are trying to copy Quran...
1,Who knows the Original Quran?,This is the worst thing i have ever seen.You don't know anything about Islam.Please learn something about Islam.Because they tell you wrong things... i am sorry for this reason.From Turkiye Omer...
1,This is not a Quran at all,"Dear reader,If you feel a pain in your stomach, where should you go, to a doctor or to a chemist? Of course to a doctor. This is the same thing. If you want to ask about a religion book like a book in Christianity, should you ask Jews? Of course not.I am a Muslim, and all Muslims and I believe that Quran is a book from ALLAH, and it is not only saved and written on papers, but also saved in our brains and hearts since so many Muslims memorize it.Going back to a book called The True Furqan, this book is a big lie. It is written by humans, and it does not represent the Quran by any means.Quran is words of ALLAH, while The True Furqan is words of humans.So please if you want to read Quran, go and buy The Quran not The True Furqan. We should know the huge difference between the two books. Actually, there is no comparison between the two books at all.Best Regards."
1,Horrible,This is not the truth why would someone claim it to be the truth obviously they have no morals or fear of god. For those who are not muslim or do not understand should read the Holy Quran and you can see a huge difference in the words.And if the surahs(chapters)don't begin with bismillah then definatley don't read it because all surahs have to have Bismillah before you start to read. so please don't waste your time or money on this untruthful book. Thank you
1,rubbish,"what a joke, seriously I can't understand what the fuss about this book is. I just read a couple of pages and it sounded like something a child would write. the intentions of this writer are really concerning though, brings on all the conspiracy theory and instead of uniting muslims and christians as some people claim it would only bring them apart."
1,Waste of money,"Perhaps the author and publisher have mistaken themselves for the likes of the Pope and the Vatican...attempting to change divine revelation is not in good form or permissable for that matter.. it seems since every other religious text has been corrupted by man, and given the responsible parties, this comes as no surprise..."
1,What a waste of time,"This book is a waste of time. Don't bother reading this rubbish, especially when the real deal is available anytime."
1,The Exact Difference,"The Quran is Revelation!This Garbage is a Creation.Only true idiots won't realize what blasphemy this is and what reactions the Muslims should have to this. In fact such reactions or going on today, because the Muslims are not respected even though the Muslims respect all others. And if you think otherwise, then your adhereing to false propoganda, just like this.Talkislam.wordpress.com"
1,What are they playing @,"As a muslim, a believer in all of His Majesties blessings and beauty and having read the Read Holy Qu'ran many times through, i cannot believe some idiot(s) have come up with some rubbish and claim it to be the true word of Allah (SWA). This is absolutely disgusting and it should be stopped from being sold and forwarded.Whatever Shaytan is doing - He will never find success. Iblis was once a true muslim before Allah (SWA) asked him to prostrate in before Adam islam. Iblis refused - hence became shaytan. So shaytan was a discrace before we came to be and he will be so in the hereafter.This is a an evil act in its purest form!"
1,The Flase Furqan,Greatly incorrect and far from truth. However you may want to buy it to know how lies are weaved.
1,Ban this garbage!!,"this couldn't be further from the truth. Don't let it fool you. If you want the truth, read the Qur'an. Unchanged and timeless."
1,"Why would they do it, if they are true?","It only clarifies the happenings in world against Islam, the faith which unites all, under one God, believes in all past prophets (PBUT) and promotes knowledge, awareness and tolerance about each other. What are they afraid of in Quran(the unchanged book)."
1,this book was written by an enemy of Islam,"If you are curious about Islam you could read the Quoran, it is the same book translated in many languages. but if your goal is to get a misinterpretation of Islam then this book is the right thing to invest your money in ."
1,THIS IS FAKE QURAN,"Please read all other reviews carefully.this is a corrupt book that wishes to give false information and horrible accusations about Islam. TRUE GARBAGE.if u need information about Islam and Real Truthful words(HOlY QURAN),Please check www.islamway.com. it's a trusted source and it's present in English Language as well"
1,Its a Crap dont buy this ..total lie,Any one who wana buy Quran can do so by going to other web pages even try to look in to web pages when you type islam in the search. This book is total lie and written by people who dont know that Quran cannot be changed till eternity.
1,Crap,"I will suggest to those non-muslim to study the real book, which is easy to understand and have direct words from Allah. You can imagine how much I can hate this book because it is against my religion; however, I would like to inform people that if you really like to know about the Islam, you have to read actual book, which have direct words and also great to understand."
1,Bought it out fo curiousity,"I bought this book and I read the Arabic/English version of it. It just doesn't flow right in Arabic in comparison to the real thing. In English it also sounds silly. Made good bathroom reading for a few days but then it is now collecting dust.Don't waste your time or money but if you are bored and read every book on amazon, then go for it."
1,ALL FALSE,THIS BOOK IS A DISGRACE 2 DA RELIGION OF ISLAM. I MUST SAY DAT WHOEVA DECIDES 2 BUY DIS BOOK MUST NOT HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR ANY MUSLIM. THIS BOOK MUST STOP FROM PUBLICATION N MUST BE BURNED WIT THOSE WHO HAVE MADE IT!!
1,A NEW BIBLE,"THAT IS WHAT THE TITLE SHOULD BE. THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK KEEP TRYING TO FINE TUNE THEIR SCRIPTURES,NOW THERE ARE TRYING TO CORRUPT THE GLORIOUS QURAN,IMPOSSIBLE. ALLAH WILL PROTECT HIS BOOK. I ONLY READ A FEW CHAPTERS, IN CHAPTER 2 (LOVE)IT STATES IN VERSE 2-3 THAT GOOD DEEDS DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU DON'T HAVE LOVE. CASE CLOSED THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE, I DO NOT HAVE TO READ ANY FURTER. AND WHY BUY IT IS FREE ON THE INTERNET!PROUD AND THANKFUL ALLAH GUIDED ME TO THE RIGHT PATH. NO TRICKS OR WATER ICE STEAM!"
1,How would anyone believe this kind of lies?,I don't believe that there are such selly and shallow people that would waste thier time creating such a stupid book .. This farce must end .. no one should waste his or her money or time buying and reading this crap .. It is absolutely frustrating and annoying to see people believing in something written by humans and think it is the path towards truth..
1,No relation to Islam,"The only thing that this book has with the Quran is they both end with 'AN'save your money, it is only good as a door stopper!"
1,"Such falsehood, such deception--I'm disappointed","Such falsehood as this is incomparable to the divine revelation that is the Quran, the Psalms, the Gospel and the Ten Commandments. While it is not surprising that this attempt was made (e.g., this type of shameful attempt has a history and is not the first time such an event has occurred), it is very disappointing nonetheless. The revelation in the Quran led to the invention and creation of Algebra, the idea of the first university system and other laudable advancements. It is such a relief to know that so many others are able and have already seen through the trickery and deception inherent in this document."
1,concerned.,im quite concerned about the true furqan because it is very very similar to the Quraan (Holy Book of the Muslims) but everything in it says the opposite and i think it is opposing Islam. although i am not a Muslim i recognize the feelings of Muslim believers.
1,if your looking for a Quran why look at this book?,"seriously folks.if you're looking for a quran,why bother with this book?the tell tale hints that its not even close to being the real deal..77 ayats? what about a publisher called wine press?im no authority but.... dont waste your cash on it.go to a local mosque and ask for a quran.i have yet to hear anyone be denied the truth."
1,THIS CRAP IS BOGUS,people please don't buy this awfull very distorted nonsense.It is not even considered a book.This nonsense scrap of false information is not true and will never be true.PLEASE SAVE THE MONEY YOU WOULD BUY THIS BOOK WITH FOR THAT WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A DEED.THESE PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO SENSE OF SHAME TO DARE WRITE A BUNCH OF RANDOM WORDS THAT HURT US TRUE MUSLIMS.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND LET THEM DO THE BURNING IN THE HELLFIRE.
1,The Face of the Deviant Deviatians!,"As everybody knows, this so-called writting is the a part of the dirty plans which have been orinally designed to dejenerate the pure pillars of Muslims. So, I""m sure that their groundless allegations will be ineffective and abortive...As a Muslim, I advise those who are eager to learn our religion to read the orininal scrippture of the KORAN. No need to waste your mind and time with these invented fabrications of falsehoods. Give a try and see the difference with your own eye."
1,Silly book & stupid Idea,this book is very silly...Muslims will never try to read this kinds of book...If you do not know Millions of muslims memorizing the holy Quran. all of them respect the quran.This is waste of time and money and will bring nothing but hatred
1,Stop it for god's sake :-x,"For god's sake... stop this crap and stop writing on your own and what ever you like and attacking Islam, and STAY AWAY FROM THE QURA'AN.Just for the records, what ever you do and try to do, Allah will protect Qura'an and always be there."
1,The True Furqan,This book is a man adopted version of the Holy Quran. MAny of the words of it has been changed. This is blasphomus and books like this should be tooken of the shelves. IT IS NOT THE QURAN. IT IS A MAN ABRIGED VERSION. IT IS NOT THE HOLY BOOK FOR MUSLIMS.
1,1 Star is a Compliment!,What a Waste! Do you like wasting money? Do you find it entertaining reading a book of rubbish? Do you want to read the biggest lies in the world? Do you want to have a book which deserves to be literally be burnt...every single copy? Then this is the book for you. However if you are seriously looking for an Islamic Book try the Holy Quran or Taleemul Haq. This gives all books a bad names. If you buy this i Promise it will be your biggest mistake. Instead of buying this we should be protesting that this should be removed from the market.DO NOT BUY!THIS IS COMPLETE RUBBISH!
1,Criminal piece of deception,"This garbage does not deserve to be sold by Amazon if they had any sense of quality and truthfulness. This is a criminal piece and a waste of paper and trees. The authors and publishers do not deserve any respect for this act of major deception.If I could I would rate this below zero.For the reader who really wants some true poetry and wisdom, there is the real and only Quran available (eg Muhammad Asad, and others)."
1,God's word cannot be changed by man,"Allah has sent the Quraan to all mankind to give them guidance and has promised to protect it. The authentic Quraan was revealed to Prophet Mohammad (Peace be upon him) as a verbal message and was later-on put in a written format that was authenticated by all the companions of Prophet Mohammad (Peace be upon him). All agreed that the Quraan must be kept in the same original text and all proofs must be critically edited and authenticated before publishing. The entire text and sequence and names of the chapters must be preserved at all times. This book did not follow these criteria. Since it failed, it must not be rated."
1,This is not the TRUE QURAN,"I urge all readers not to waste their time in purchasing and reading this book, this is not the real/true Quran. Real Quran can be ontain from any Islamic Center or Mosque.For the past 1400+ years the Quran has remained unchanged and God (Allah) has taken responsibilty to protect the true identity of this book.Please do not misunderstand Islam. It is not what we're seeing in the news media. I hope you all will make a smart move."
1,........This is False .......,"this is so called Quran opposes many Islamic beliefs. in one of its ayats it describes having more than one wife as fornication, divorce being non-permissable and it uses a new system for thesharing out of the will, opposing the current one.Please dont waste your time and if you are really interested go and get Holy Quran.It doesnt say anything about islam. It is all lie."
1,Evangelical Christians are just a cover,"The writing is atrocious and nowhere it matches the sublime writings of the Quran. The group who wrote it took from the Quran and added to it the concept of trinity as well as a heap of insults on the Prophet Mohammed. As it was said before, this is a desperate attempt from a people who are looooosing!!!!!! the spiritual and doctrinal battle. But this goes beyond that, The group writing it are emboldened by zionists. This is Zionist Modus Operandi..a la Pilate if you get my drift. Throughout history, that's how they behaved.If you need to know what Allah said in his Quran, you need to read the Quran...The one Allah revealed to Mohammed and engraved It in tablets in Heaven.How would you feel if I change the Bible? but wait..it had changed 1000 times maybe more...So what do you expect from people who don't even respect their own scriptures...Read it and laugh."
1,Do not buy this changed Furqan!!!,"The Holy Qur'an is unchanged from 7th century until now. Some silly man trying to change and divide it according to their wishes. Do not buy this, get the whole and unchanged Holy Qur'an if you want to learn Islam."
1,Not the Real Deal,"I'm not sure what the point is with this book as it's not the actual Quran. I guess the authors were looking to write a fiction tale about the Quran; however, they've done a poor job with it. Not worth the time, let alone the price. They shouldv'e embellished the story more to make it more entertaining. Definitely not a good read and clearly not the right book for someone trying to read the real Quran. Can't believe I wasted my time..."
1,Call this the true Quran??,"There is only ONE Quran, and that has been the case for more than 1400 years, and it will remain the only ONE quran. It is gods words, no man made book will ever overwrite it.If you would like to read the muslim's holy book please read the original and only true Quran."
1,GARBAGE !!!!! GARBAGE !!!!!! GARBAGE !!!! BAN THIS BOOK AND PROTEST IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE !!!!!!!! AS A FAITHFUL AND DEVOUT PRACTICING MUSLIM WHO KNOWS THE HOLY QUR'AN I AM OUTRIGHT DISGUSTING BY THISPATHETIC DISPLAY OF IGNORANCE TO TRY AND MISLEAD PEOPLE ABOUT OUR HOLY RELIGION OF ISLAM. THIS IS A MISLEADING, UNTRUE PIECE OF GARBAGEAND IT BELONGS IN THE TRASH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NON-MUSLIM PLEASE PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS DISGUSTING GARBAGE. THE REAL HOLY QUR'AN AS WE MUSLIMS KNOW CONTAINS 114 CHAPTERSAND HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR THE PAST 1400 YEARS. SO PLEASE DON'T EVENWASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRASH AND LEARN ISLAM THROUGH OTHER MEANS.THIS IS JUST A PATHETIC ATTEMPT TO TRY AND ATTACK ISLAM AND MUSLIMS.SO PLEASE DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT READ OR PURCHASE THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!THANK YOU AND SALAAM ALAIKUM (PEACE BE UNTO YOU)"
1,Falsehood is bound to Perish,"This a try by the enemies of Islam and peace to pull Muslims away from their religion but surely this plot and its plotters will fail miserably here and in the hereafter. Allah says in the Quran ""they plot, but We too plot and surely Allah is the best of planners"". ON the completion of the Holy Quran, The Almighty Allah Himself took the responsibility to preserve the Holy Quran. We can see today how all other books like Bible have been changed so much while the Quran is still in its true form in the both writing and in the hearts of the believers. Fear Allah and his punishment. Allah don't likes hypocrites."
1,Fake Quran,"Dear All,This book is an attempt to modify the true word of Allah SWT in the Holy Quran and mislead the young muslim generation. Apparently the non-believers believe that just like how they've made their own versions of their Bible they can do the same with the Holy Quran. However, one must not forget, this book is in the heart and minds of millions of muslims across the world and any attempts to modify it will lead to nothing but failure.Don't waste your money buying this book."
1,This is a misleading book......,"The only purpose of this book is to confuse people into beliving that this is the Quran (the true book of Islam). This book is just a poor attempt to confuse people into being anti-islam because it contains false and misleading information. For those of you looking for the truth about Islam, read Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukahree Hadith and the Quran. To learn about the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, read The Sealed Nectar which is a very authenitc and award winning book. The only reason to read this book is to expand your knowledge about how people are trying to belittle Islam. In fact, it is encouraged in Islam to learn about other things to strengthen your iman (faith). Bottom line, don't read this book if you are not aware of the true meaning of Islam and read this book if you wish to learn how people are attacking Islam."
1,Furqan?,"Then wow to those who write The Book in their own hands, and then say: ""This is from Allah,"" To traffic it for a miserable price!-Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby. -Quran, 2:79"
1,Crap to Fake the Quran,"This book is crap. The writer and the publisher are trying to mislead people by pretending that this is the Quran. This is not the Quran. People, don't waste your money and time on this book. This book is filled with a bunch of lies. If you want to know what is in the Quran, get the Holy Quran and read it. Quran is the word of God and spreading lies against God is evil."
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!,"[...]Remember the commandment; You shall not lye!you can try all you like, but even if you destroy all the Korans in the world, we would be able to produce the ORIGINAL one back again... want to know how? Millions of Muslims have memorised it from cover to cover in the original revealed language, (regardless of their nationality) that's how![...]"
1,When will this end,"Don't waste your time, money or effort on this falsification. This vile compilation of paper is not representative of Islam, Muslims or even a far reflection of anything that could be remotely construed as being Quranic or Islamic.When will attempts to hatefully alienate Muslims all over the world end? It is neither prudent nor warranted to deliberately and falsely demonize 1.5 Billion Muslim 0r 23-25% of the global population...and to what end ? and for whose benefit?In an age of Globalization, I had hoped that people would reach out to each other and converge on the necessity to respect cultural specificities of all peoples, religions and cultures.If you want to know more about Muslims, read real Muslim books, do not get fooled by this printed rubbish, it will only distort your views and cost you money."
5,"Jimmie Boogie Learns About Smoking, 3rd Edition","An excellent book for families of young children.Jimmie Boogie and the kids invite you onto the playground for fun while teaching about the dangers of smoking and addiction. The messages age given through a multicultural group of friends with happy freckled faces, sibling support and possitive peer pressure to not smoke. The delightful coloring book images keep the attention of young readers. Children learn possitive messages about staying healthy,and ways people can get help to stop smoking. A friendly book,an important message written in a sensitive, caring way."
5,Great Variety,I love that these come in 4 jars and not bags. My family has enjoyed many a good meals.
1,Not Fresh,"I don't know why it took me so long to write this - and I should have returned the package, but I didn't open it right away, and when I did, I had to check all four of them. Rancid. They smell awful, they taste awful (I cooked some to be sure) and I have new RiceSelect products in my pantry now from the local grocery - and the difference is paramount. I just wish I had returned it for a refund. Will never buy this online again! NO matter if I'm craving it!"
5,Terrific grain selection,"What a great selection of grains. We love the different grains. Sometimes get tired of regularRiceSelect Whole Grain Lover's Sampler, Rice and Couscous Variety Pack, 4-Jar Setrice and pasta. Love the containers too."
4,Great Selection of Whole Grains,"This is a very toothsome collection of rices and whole wheat couscous. In the sampler, there is enough porduct to last a single person several months. This is a purchase I will repeat."
4,Tasty rice at a price that is nice,"I like these products, a lot. Buying from Amazon saved $10 or so from the grocery store prices, plus they were delivered directly to my house instead.There's enough variety and quality here to keep you and your family interested in eating healthy rice, and they don't require too much work to make a truly delicious meal. I like it a lot."
2,Puffed rice prices!,"I recieved these as a gift from a friend who knows I love rice and grains. I've been cooking grains 'forever'. I buy 20 lb. bags of Carolina or Riceland rice for less than $00.60 lb. They are better tasting than these 'select rices' and I fill them into my own canisters.At about $4.50 per 2 lb. jar -how good do you expect this to be? Yes,the jars are cute, but I recycle similar jars from other foods that might otherwise be tossed in the garbage! Save your money, it's not worth it."
4,Balanced and helpful,"I have been using a prayer journal based on Payne's model for nearly a year and have seen her ideas move me towards greater intimacy with Christ. Other volumes she's written are more complex, but this is quite readable. Her emphasis is always to look straight to Christ, not to a method."
2,"Looks nice, band let go first day.","A pin holding the band to the watch fell out the first day. Other than that, it's a great looking watch, slightly thinner and lighter than my previous citizen eco drive. The only complaint I have is that the face is grey, the hands are grey and the hour markings are grey, which, of course makes it hard to read. There is touch of luminous white on the hands and hour markings, but just a touch."
1,Poorly Made Garbage,"I purchased my watch in March of 2012 and by November of 2012 the pins holding the watch to the band no longer worked and the watch would just fall off my wrist. If you want to drop ~$160 on a watch that lasts less than a year, go for it."
5,Gorgeous Watch,"I hate those ENORMOUS watches you always see on home shopping networks. I wanted my husband to have a nice watch that looked masculine, but wasn't overpowering. This watch is perfect. It's classy, very attractive and I love that it has the Eco-Drive feature. It's a gorgeous watch. I'm thrilled with the purchase."
2,A little disappointed,"I enjoyed the first track, but after a while, all of the songs started to sound the same. It was difficult to tell the difference between the end of one track and the beginning of another. Good effort...definitely some potential here if Riccy mixes things up a little bit."
1,okay,"when i bought this ring i thought i would absolutly love it but i did not. the band was bigger that i thought it would be, and i just didnt like it overall."
4,Use Common Sense,"I know so many people absolutely hate Ravenwolf for one reason or another. I own two books by her (this one and solitary witch), and I've only found a few instances where I scratched my head. Of course, I tend to read everything with a grain of salt and understand that any spell I read can be altered to suit my purpose, etc. Silverwolf is definately not a total fluffbunny in my humble opinion, which can be good or bad depending upon the mindset of the reader. I would suggest that a beginner start somewhere else as this series assumes you have a handle on witchcraft. Please also remember that one person's idea of violating the rede may be different than yours, adjust (or reject) the information you receive to match what you think is right. I found this book to be a nice idea generator when I'm in a situation and need a jumpstart on following through. The information is mostly concise, although there are instances in the book that a little confusing."
5,A refreshing Ravenwolf read,It's nice to see Silver Ravenwolf write something besides how to books. The spells in this nifty little volume range from extremely easy to a little more difficult and covers just about everything you may need magickal protection for.
5,Cookbook,"This book is exactly what it is meant to be, a cook book of spells for protection. The writer doesn't claim it to be anything else. It says on the cover in plain site ""Spells for Protection!"" If you want more in depth teachings about magic she does get into this subject in other books. Anyone who has been practicing witchcraft for very long knows ""anyone"" can cast a spell, even if they don't know there doing it. Anger and jealousy are both energy and can be directed by the people feeling them and cause harm to you. I personally like her techniques for protection and use them often. There simple and to the point and she encourages you to customize them to your needs. So many of the people reviewing her books really need to lighten up."
4,Really good!!!,"I'm not a huge fan of SRW, but I do like some of her books, this being one of them. This is a spellbook, it's clearly labled, so I don't get why people would complain about this, if it's not what you are looking for don't BUY it!!! The spells that I've tried, I tweaked a bit to fit me (which I do for any spell written by someone else), and they worked out great. I plan on buying the rest of the series. If you don't like SRW or spellbooks that give clear instructions, don't buy this."
3,Its allright.,"Silver Ravenwolf. Unusual name, ok writer. Some of the spells in this book I would be unsure of and hesitant to try. I like the SAP spell, though. It may be her tradition, but I like to stick to asking the Lord and Lady rather than asking a million different godesses/gods. but I like the practical advice she gives. May her writing improve."
5,Good But some things brake=(,"HI,This doll is fun but, NOt really durabel! What I found braking is the ""Cowboy"" Suitcase the hinges broke off.SO if you just want the doll get this, Otherwise some things will brake! PS.This Is the only brat doll that somthing broke."
5,this bratz doll is sooooo cute!!!!!,I love this bratz doll! She is so cute! her clothes are nice and it's fun 2 play with her. I love to play with bratz! before bratz dolls I dispized dolls. And now I love them!I recommend this doll 2 any girl who want her!- hamstercutie
5,Cloe RULEZ!,"Bratz is so great. And The Slumber Party Collectionis the best ever! The Bratz is a lot better than Barbie!My favorite doll is Cloe Slumber Party!I have one for myself and i just love her!I use all my money to get more clothes to her.!She had blond hair, and blue eys, and looks likean beauty Angel. All her accessories is cuteand her pyjama is so CUTE!Cloe is a CUTE doll , and she's my best friend!I love her - so go and get her!"
3,"Great sound, but the action is not realistic","In 2002, I researched the best ""digital pianos"" under $1,000 and this one seemed like the best value with best feel. It was at the time, and I'm not disappointed, but compared to the current product offerings from Casio, and Yamaha's newest product offerings, this keyboard does not provide the ""genuine"" feel of a grand piano's action, and it does not provide connectivity to your computer except through the MIDI ports. Now that I've upgraded my digital recording studio with a laptop, I need something with USB or firewire connectivity and speed and interaction with software. Still, I own and I use it, and I like it. I produced my first movie soundtrack with it in 2002, and it sounds great. It's not as heavy as some keyboards, so I guess some people would consider it ""portable"", but I don't. It is touch-sensitive, but the action is not heavy like a real piano. Try it before you buy it so you will not feel disppointed."
4,Christmas memory,I received this book as a gift from my great grandmother back in the 1970s. It was read to me so many times that the binding is now held together with tape. I was so happy to find a copy to give to my niece. She loves the book just as much as I did.
3,A little known event of the Vietnam War.,"In March, 1970 an American tramp steamer carrying napalm and other bombs was hijacked by two crew members. This mutiny resulted in the Columbia Eagle being taken from international waters to Cambodia and then interned.Many thought this was a secret attempt by the CIA to arm Lon Nol's faction in the Cambodian coup de etat. It was however a simple mutiny of two individuals against the policy of the United States. This book is the story of the mutiny and what happened to the two mutineers and an Army deserter in Cambodia. One of the mutineers and the deserter were later executed by the Khymer Rouge.I commend the authors for writing an interesting story about the Vietnam War. Since the Columbia Eagle was the only vessel to mutiny in the two hundred years of the U.S. Merchant Marine, this should be a more well known fact."
5,Frame Games: Wonderful Fun!,Terry Stickels is a great entertainer for the mind--and his puzzles are both challenging and wonderful fun for the entire family!
5,Great buy,"I gave this train set (along with Sureclips - necessary!!) to my almost 2 yr old son for Christmas. He loves it!!! Much cheaper than Thomas and so much fun. I had to take 1"" off one piece to build the track shown in the picture, but that was no big deal. Certainly worth saving $50+ over the Thomas. My son can run a Thomas train on it with no problem. The Sureclips keep things secure for playing, but let the tracks be interchangeable."
4,Railway Set,"I bought this set for my 4yr old son for Christmas.The tracks are solid wood and good quality. The set comes with easy to understand instructions to set up approximately 6 different layouts. My son loves the extra included accessories like the depot, hills, and bridges.Very well built and educational for a young boy."
5,A great set with tons of possibility,"We bought this set for our 2-year-old train fanatic, and we're extremely satisfied with it. The parts all seem well made and durable. We were able to quickly put together a large track configuration using the drawings provided in the set. We did not have the difficulty with the turntable that other reviewers have described. Some also said they had to force the pieces in order to make the track designs in the drawing. We had to tweak ours as well because there is a bit of play in the joints between pieces of track. But we have not yet been unable to get it to work.We also already had a motorized Thomas engine, and he fits well on this track EXCEPT that he can't cross the railroad bridge. We are very pleased with the size of this set and the creativity it fosters as our kids create their own track designs.***You will need Suretrack clips. We bought two packs of them at the urging of other reviewers, and they have saved us a huge amount of frustration."
5,Great Present,Purchased train set for my grandson's 5th birthday. My grandson is all boy and this train set makes the grade as far as durability and imagination. All the parts are sturdy and plentiful. No electricity or batteries needed just imagination. A childs toy which is really a toy and allows a child to be a child. Product was delivered as promised!
5,Birthday Gift,"I purchased this for my grandson for his 3rd birthday. He needs help assembling it, but loves to play with it. It is perfect for his Thomas and Friends trains."
5,Great value!,"I bought this set because my 5-year-old son has been begging for a Thomas the Train set and I cannot afford those prices! So I took a chance on this one, and I am THRILLED! The roundhouse is very high quality, almost identical to the Thomas the Train one which sells for $80. The set comes with lots of good quality wooden track (no splinters or sharp edges, and it all fits together fine), two bridges, a turntable, two cranes that are easy to operate, two trains, a truck, two people, trees, and signs.Best of all, you can build the exact display shown on the box and still have leftover track! No disappointment!My only complaint is that one of the little trains that came with it keeps losing a wheel. Not such a big deal for us, because we bought Thomas the Train engines to use instead (yes, they fit on the track just fine). This set is supposed to be compatible with Brio trains too, but we haven't tried those yet."
4,Great deal!,"This set is wonderful and wonderfully priced too. We were going to buy the Thomas expansion set for $40 and when we saw this we bought it instead and got so much more! We use it with our Thomas and Brio trains and tracks and for a fraction of the price of the Thomas train sets you get a ton of tracks, trains and accessories. Great deal! We are going to get the Melissa and Doug train table also. It's so much more reasonably priced than most other tables and even has a storage drawer that does not cost extra."
5,Great set,"My almost 2 year old loves this train set. We had to create our own layout because my son kept tearing down the bridges, but that just means that this will keep him entertained for many years to come because we can keep changing layouts. Overall it is a great set, but it is bigger than we expected, so we have to find a place to put it!"
2,Not worth the money,"It's a great system to LOOK at but not necessarily to play with. The wooden rails constantly fall apart. You need the plastic clips that hold it all in place. Without those get ready to be frustrated as the rails fly all over the place because they do not snap together. I recommend the GEO trax better. They snap together and don't fall apart. No, they don't have the wood look like this one does but when a 3 year old attacks this you won't care about the look but the durability and annoyance of putting it back together 50 times a day."
4,"Fun, fun, fun!",My 3 year-old daughter LOVES her train tracks. They hold up well to her abuse : ) and there are infinate possiblilities for construction. The only problem we have is that they can be frustrating for young children to assemble. The bridges fall down if the blocks are not placed under them correctly. I think they are great fun for children and adults alike : )
5,Awesome!,I bought this train track for my son's third birthday. It is an awesome train track! My son loves it he has not tired of it in the 6 months that he has had it. He loves building the track. 97% of the pieces are very durable( my son is very rough with his toys) The trains are very cute. I spent a long time on amazon trying to decide which train to buy him and I am not disappointed. I would buy it again. I recommend this train track for any boy who love trains.
5,"Very well made, like more expencive brands","All the pieces match very well. This is an high quality product, for a very reasonable price. A lot of fan for kids. Make sure you get a table and glue the track, otherwise instead of enjoying your kids playing, they will enjoy you putting the track together over and aver and over ..."
3,"It's fine, but....","We bought this train set for a train table I'd picked up a yard sale. Well, the price of this clearly offset whatever discount I had gotten. By the way- Amazon's price is really inflated so look elsewhere!The train set is nice, cute and sturdy, but there is nothing about it that justifies the price. The trains lack any interesting details... and it's just a train set in the end! Try to find a sale at Tuesday morning, and don't be attached to the brand name."
4,"Great, but doesn't fit Thomas trains","this set is awesome, and super durable, but the Thomas trains are too big to fit."
4,Great Train Set!!!,"I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday. It is so neat. His exact words when he first saw it were, ""yeah, trains, where's Thomas."" Luckily, I had purchased a few of the Thomas and Friends trains ahead of time. This set is completely compatible with Thomas engines and the Thomas track that comes with Thomas destinations. This set comes with instructions for different layouts. Of course, I set up the most extensive layout that would fit on the train table. I ended up downsizing, and taking away the bridge and other track that were elevated. A two year old does not need such an extensive layout, but he will like all the pieces when he gets older. I highly recommend this toy. Finally a fun toy that doesn't require batteries!"
4,"Well Built, with One Exception","This is a great train set. It seems well built, it's large and my son about died when he saw it. On major flaw however would be in the design of the raised portions of the rails. The wood rails just sit on wood blocks. They barely stand up on their own let alone when a child attempts to run a train over it. So, while I recommend this train set, I also recommend you budget an extra $10 to go buy some 3M double-sided mounting tape and emotionally prepare to cut 30 1-inch strips of it to secure the wood risers to the track. There is really no getting around it. Other than that, my son is happy, so I am happy. Enjoy!"
4,Great value!,"We debated and researched to ridiculous lengths before purchasing this particular set. Our little boy has loved it so we're happy with our decision to save $$$ by not buying the official Thomas set instead. My only complaint (and I don't know if this would be different with other brands), but the tracks elevated portion of the tracks and bridges come apart annoyingly easily. We finally got one box of SureTrack clips and will need another box to finish the job. Maybe purchase both together to save the headache. Otherwise, it really is a good set- and a great value."
5,Railway is a hit with grandson,This set was a Christmas gift for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it. I will never review again.
2,Disappointed...,"I guess because of the reviews we had high hopes for this train set! The pieces are all very nice quality but the tracks are a huge problem for our 2 1/2 year old. The tracks do not fit tightly together so they constantly fall apart! Christmas morning was pretty disappointing with a train set that would not stay standing! We starting searching for solutions and found the train track clips on Amazon which we ordered. If you order this train set, you should order a large 3-pack of train clips to keep it together. The clips work nicely but do not work on the bridge so that section continues to fall for us. We did not want a set that we had to glue to keep it together so I think we are giving up and going to see if we can return this one. The train and other pieces are very nice but I guess it doesn't matter if you can't keep the tracks together."
5,Amazing,"Another amazing product by Melissa & Doug.I can't say enough about the quality and workmanship you get in this set. The colors are rich and crips on the trains.The cranes are perfect in function but my kids don't seem to care - they use them just the same. I bought several expansion packs to add onto this and my kids have played endlessly with it for weeks now.It comes in an enormous box and takes up alot of room on the floor - but their imagination and creativity with this set are endless. I wouldn't have been pleased with any of the smaller sets after seeing this one.The majority of the pieces are small and easily stored in a small tupper-tote, only the roundhouse doesn't fit in the box we bought for storage so it sits on top of the lid.I would highly recommend this to any parent with kids 3 yrs and up. We bought this for my 3 yr old son and he loves to play with it - but he usually asks for someone (older sister or adult) to help design the track. The whole family is enjoying this set."
5,Mom of 2,"We bought this for our 4 & 2 year old for Christmas. I love it! They are both able to set up the tracks by themselves, and the set is complete enough to provide a lot of variety. It really is perfect. Highly recommend!"
5,Love this!,"I bought this as a gift for my 2 year old twins. They're too little to understand the tracks shouldnt be smashed by little Godzillas, but this set provides hours of endless fun. I am thrilled with this purchase, and am sure this will last us a few years. There are sooo many ways to set up the tracks, and included in the package are pictures with design ideas."
5,My son loves this set!,"I got this set almost a year ago for my sons first birthday, He loved it from day one!I read some reviews and decided to buy it, almost a year now ant the trains look great, some scratches but nothing major! we have thomas too and they got scratched too! I highly recommend this set to anyone who is looking for an affordable set to begin with.the tracks are compatible with thomas trains, so you can add thomas to your collection if your kids are into thomas."
4,My almost 2 year old enjoys this!,My son got this for Christmas and really likes it. We glued it down to have a permanent track because my almost two year old was getting frustrated. I would highly recommended gluing it down for the parents sake too! We have a few Thomas engines and they work well with this set.
2,not suited for age 3 and under,I gave the train set 2 stars due to constant falling bridge. The set is not suited for age 3 and under. The bridge is secured with very thin support that falls off constantly unless you glue the bridge and support together.
1,Poor quality on the trains,The tracks are fine and work well with the real (but overpriced) Thomas trains. The trains that come with this set are poorly made and do not roll well and cannot go around the curves in the track without the wheels coming out of the tracks. I consider the trains/cars largly useless. Perhaps I should write M/D to see if I simply have a defective set.The problem is that Melissa/Doug used rivets on the wheels and the rivets are too tight and do not allow the wheels to slip sideways. The real Thomas trains are not riveted and they have a sideways slip of a few millimeters that allow the trains to go around the curves with the wheels staying in the track.I do not recommend this product.
5,Grandson Loves it!!!,"My Grandson is 2 1/2 yrs old. I was looking for a railway that would withstand a little boys play. This FAR exceeded my expectations. It was easy to assemble (per my Son in law) and the play time spent on this is amazing. I also invested in the Suretrack locking system because of his age (but he can change up the track easily when he is older). My daughter also bought the Thomas the Train (battery powered) which pairs perfectly and also has enough power to pull the trainset that came with the railway. A quality wooden railway set for this price was truly a godsend. He's also expecting a little brother, and I know this train set will be a life long toy with many years of enjoyment yet to come."
5,Great Value for Money,"A great train set for boys and girls! It has all the things you need in a starter train set, and is much cheaper than some other big brand sets. It works well with other wooden sets and trains, and fits nicely on a train table in a couple of formats. The bridges can be tricky for little ones, as the risers are easily knocked over, or out of place, but other than that, it's been great fun for the entire family!"
4,Very good for academic studies,"This book is recommended for acadmic studies, due to its multi-aspect perspectives. It offers wide understanding of marketing and business strategic thinking. Offers good value for money.Hillel Avihai (Ph.D.)"
4,Very much recommended book!!!,This book is one of the greats books describing marketing. The level of details is unbelievable and it helped me a lot in my study for CIM professional diploma.
2,"See No Evil, Book two","Last week I went to the bookstore to pick up my reserved copies of the Smallville books. I was so excited, I figured I would read #2 first considering #1 is a teleplay of the first episode, I must say, I was disappointed with the book. It is not like the series at all which is amazing. The book's plot was predictable, beautiful, bossy rich girl gets powers and tries to destroy everyone and everything in her path that she doesn't agree with. Of course in the end Clark comes to the rescue and no one is the wiser. All in all I would say the book was an ok read, but the show is much better. I will try to read the other Smallville novels though since it is one of my favourite shows."
1,Here and now--Ohio's canals: The background of Ohio's canal system,"I will never purchase anything from here again. I purchased this book from a vendor not far from my house and paid for expedited shipping. Now, 10 days later I still haven't received this book....and Amazon has not been a help to sorting this out.I could have walked to the store, bought the book, and walked home in two days....this is totally unacceptable."
1,iriver pmc 120 disapointing,pmc 120 wasn't worth the $100 I spent. Music quality is fair but glitches frequently. I've been unable to make it through an entire video without the player freezing. The picture quality is low and did not meet my expectations.
4,its very pretty but...,"i do think its pretty, cute, and funny (like the cat girl pouncing on a little mouse that looks like jerry!) but there is some pictures of naked girls, ones wearing reveling clothes, some are fully dressed but have [...]. so be sure not to the book to little kids. but there are gorgeous ones,like mermaids. i hope it will inspire its readers ;)!"
4,Pretty Gals indeed,fantastic it improves your drawing to profesional like masterpiece with the best detail there is to know. they describe every thing perfectly and even some tips are included.
5,THE BEST!!,"Well, I bought this book recently and I love it. It shows you everything you need to know form head to toe. I think that all those crazy drawing people out there shoud definently go buy this book. It's worth the money."
5,The secret of Bishoujo is cuteness and this book teaches it!,Bishoujo (pretty girl) is excellently described in this volume and techniques for achieving it in your drawings are provided with lots of helpful examples. It includes instruction how to cue the cuteness of your characters in their appearance and actions. The reason is simple: cuteness really is the secret of Bishoujo and this book describes very well how to express that in your characters. These techniques go very well with the techniques also shown in the related book: How to Draw Manga: Pretty Girls. Having both in your library is a must.
5,All it takes...,"This is EXACTLY what I have been searching for in a ""How To"" Manga book since I first started watching anime. What people must realize is that the book won't make you a better artist. It's the practice and the TECHNIQUES from the book that you can use to become a better manga artist. With this book, and a little practice, you'll be right up there with Hayao Miyazaki (director of Princess Mononoke). All in all, a worthwhile purchase for anyone yearning to become an artist in the Japanese Manga style."
3,THIS BOOK IS THE BEST!!!,"...Now to the book. if you think this is a book that will tell you just how to draw pictures,well your wrong.The book teaches you how to draw more than just pictures. it teaches you how to draw deformed girls and Really (really) pretty girls(and much more). If you are hardcore (like me) or not,I reccomend getting this book. There is nudity in it but only in part of it.Now for the downfalls.As i said before, it does have nudity.The book is also geared toward better drawers .Overall this book is definely a good,solid title."
3,Male Orientated Market,"Female Manga characters are everywhere, female manga artists are few and hard to find. Basically, this book was written by guys for guys.It's fairly useful for drawing girls. It has excellent sections on drawing bodies, expressions poses and clothes. Some of the content I will never use (because I don't draw soft porn) would be the how to draw breasts squished up on tables, under arms, in clothing and the section devoted to characters removing clothing and bathing/showering. This book is sad. But only compared to its counterpart ""How to Draw Male Charactes which strangely enough doesn't show you how to make guys look like they are removing their clothes or squishing their *ahem* in to various positions. If I ever become a reknowned manga artist I promise to release a tastful how to draw girls book... or at least a how to draw males book that matches its female counterpart."
2,This is a great book...,"If you would like to learn how to draw women taking showers, stripping down to their panties, languishing in bed naked, prancing about in negligee or serving cocktails in a bunny costume. Otherwise, I would suggest another book."
3,Okay..,"Most of the stuff in here was great; but then again its going places that don't need to be explored. If these manga books would just have their female characters put some clothing on, it would be just as good and less.... nude."
2,The book that never was,"I ordered this book on December 15th, and now its January 19th. I just had to approve its delay. Also, this is the second time I've tried to order it. My advice to you is, order it, but be prepared to wait a looooooooong time.I gave it a star because it SOUNDS cool..."
3,Can we say 1980's?,"I bought this DVD at Target for $1 in the ""Dollar Spot"" section. It was worth $1, but it is extremely out dated. It says it was produced in 2004, but there is no way! The outfits are rediculous! The woorkout is okay, but I would reccomend checking Target before pay 2$ plus shipping and handling charges."
3,"Okay hardware, bad news software and support",I purchased this product to setup a home lan to my wife's laptop on the other side of the house. We wanted to share a cable modem and a printer. I installed and used their software. Could not get internect connection sharing working so I removed their software and went with ICS from Win 98SE. That seems to work well. The doc is very sparse and the tech support just gives you the usual reinstall the drivers etc. pitch. The adapters run pretty well except every once in a while the link drops between the machines and we have to reboot to get the link back. Not sure if this problem is Netgear's or Microsoft's. We also have a Toshiba Portage 3015 that refuses to work with the adapter. I had previously had problems with Laplink trying to use a USB to USB connection. I think it is a Toshiba problem but they don't seem to be coming up with a fix so beware.
1,Less than expected,"UPDATE 4/13/2010Dell & NETGEAR indicare NOT COMPATIBLE with Windows7Purchased only one available (used).Arrived promptly alone in USPO bubble bag without phone cord, or instructions.Unit was dirty, maybe ink or other semi permanent residue.Plugged into brand new Dell laptop; I supplied cord and plugged into ""wall"" marked outlet and home wall phone outlet (hardwired) as well as USB port.USB power illuminated but computer indicated the adapter or connection was already in use.After 6-10 attempts, now backtracking NETGEAR for help.Fast delivery and low price don't count if quality doesn't live up to expectations first."
2,Incompatible with Earthlink DSL,"The network part of this works fine, but I could not get this to work with my internet service (Earthlink DSL), which was one of the main reasons to put in the network.Technical service took about 45 minutes to reach, but was friendly. They couldn't help me get it to work, however. They did suggest that one simply use Internet Connection Sharing in Windows SE rather than their software. Alas, I do not have SE . . ."
4,First USB Phoneline Adapter,Advantage to user that do not have a PCI slot available. Great usage of phone line to network your laptop and connect anywhere from your house to your main computer and share all the resources. Great idea and great product!
1,Doesn't work (with Windows ME at least),I gave up today trying to make this crap work after a week's wasted time and six tries trying to understand the (Hindu speaking) technical support engineers. A link was established but neither computer EVER saw the other no matter what I tried. I can't recommend this stuff for anyone with Windows ME. Don't know about any other OS. Gave it one star simply because I couldn't give it zero stars!
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be a diappointment. I expected a book which would discuss the architecture of the buildings of Philadelphia. Instead the book is about the history of the city and its buildings with scant discussion of the architure. A Better title for this book would be , The Historical Significance of The Buildings of Philadelphia. For a guide book their were surprisingly few (black and white) photographs. I would suggest , Philadelphia Architecture: A Guide To The City; by The Foundation For Architecture ."
1,all his opinion,"I wanted a book that gave me lots of facts, not that gave the authors opinion on hippies and other irelevant things."
4,Very interesting - a totally different believable perspective...,"The author has certainly reviewed his topic extremely well. It should be said that this is maybe more a ""Bible Study"" than a general read on End-times, and if I had realised this, I would have read the book very differently. It does need to be read with your Bible alongside. The only problem I had with it was that it was so detailed, and at times confusing in the reading of same, that you do really need to be awake and alert to take it all in! That is not a criticism, but just an observation."
1,thank you,"Based on the reviews posted, I see this book is half-wrong- especially in terms of the ten nations. The author sounds like he has a grudge against the Muslims/Arabs, since the ten nations are not focused in the Middle East. I will keep searching Amazon for a book to give as a gift. I can't in good conscience give one that is subversive to the truth. Thank you for the reviews, they really helped keep me from buying this book, and that's a good thing :)"
1,Conspiracy Theory Run Amok...,Christian psycho-babble at its best. I knew it was coming...y2k computer hysteria and ufo hysteria brought together into one goofy book. Just wait until the end of the year...
1,Atrocious textbook,"This textbook is hands down the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of using, and I have had some other bad ones too. This book is laid out in a terrible order and the examples are completely WORTHLESS!!!! You will be depending completely on your proffessor for any amount of learning you do in a course with this book. This book is so bad that it will litteraly have the exact same problem copyied and pasted 4-5 times at the end of each section with only slight alterations or different numbers.I am not making this up either, one of the equations in this book is sigma = sqrt(sigma^2) ?!?!?!? I'm glad I have this book to teach me that.....If you do not need this book for a course, then stay away from it at all costs!!!!!"
1,Terrible to learn from,I am a student who took at class which used this book. I am a person to tends to learn best out of the book and I have to say this book was terrible. A lot of the examples skipped over very important details. To me if it is something a student needs to show when showing working a homework problem then the book needs to show that as well in the examples.
1,Not adapted for Kindle at all.,"Because of the bad reviews for the Kindle NIV version, I waited for this to be released with the hope that the shortcomings would be addressed. Well, the problems are now worse. There is still no way to jump to a verse. The reason why it is worse is that because of all the study reference headings that are now in the TOC, you have to go to the menu, then TOC, then to the next page before you can even select OT or NT. After several times of practice, it is still taking me twice as long to find a verse as does a paper copy. This may be fine for reading cover to cover, but I need to use this in Bible study class. Completely useless for most needs... and overpriced. This is NOT adapted for kindle... only converted. Zondervan does not have a clue."
2,How do we navigate using kindle?,Because it is the Word it deserves a 5 star rating. However I downloaded bible into my kindle and cant navigate to find a book or verse. How do we navigate if I cant find he table of contents? Can someone respond? Please.
3,Disappointed,"I wanted a study Bible for my Kindle. I figured it would have all the cool information like my printed copy by Tyndale has.. only linked right to the verses. Nope, there are tons of links but so far all I've found is references to verses that are related and a couple of definitions of words. Considering the Kindle version actually costs MORE than the printed copy (what's up with THAT?) I would expect more than I got. Basically it's a regular Bible.Zondervan, I'm very disappointed with you!"
1,DO NOT BUY KINDLE VERSION!!!!!,"I have the Life Application version of this Study Bible from Zondervan and absolutely love it. Having received a Kindle for Christmas, I immediately purchased this Kindle version. IT IS NOT ADAPTED for KINDLE. Please read an earlier review posted explaining the problems. I wish I had... I would have saved myself not only the $$$ but also the headache and wasted time of trying to navigate through this Study Bible. Don't know if the other reviewer mentioned it or not, but I cannot find ANY of the study notes in this Bible."
3,ebook disappointing,"I love this Bible in the physical book but, don't recommend the ebook. It does not have the study notes, a huge part of a study Bible. It has all the intro pages just not the reference/study notes normally found in the physical book on each page."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR KINDLE,"There is no way to navigate through this study Bible. You cannot go directly to chapter and verse, I wish that I could get a refund. This is absolutely the worst book that I have bought for my kindle."
3,Ok If You're Not Doing Research,"I purchased the Kindle version hoping that would appear a little similar to the non-digital version. Sadly, it was a bit lacking when it came to descriptions I'd see at the bottom of the non-digital version. Jumping around this version of the Bible wasn't as complicated when I discovered how to use the Table of Contents. It's a very nice Bible if all you're doing is reading but I'll stick with the non-digital version for any research."
2,"NIV Study Bible, large print,","This Bible is too big and too heavy to carry. If you only want it for a desk reference, it has plenty too offer."
4,good content; heavy delivery,"I had worn out one NIV study bible so I basically knew what to expect in buying a new one. It has had more added since my old edition and every extra bit (well, mostly) is helpful. I got large print and was not prepared for how very heavy it is. Not exactly the best for caryying back and forth to church."
2,Donwload a sample before buyimg for Kindle,If you like maps consider another translation. Download a sample and go to the maps section and look at the Exedus map. Mostly unreadable even with zoom.
2,Poor quality,"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this book.The paper quality is poor, the typeface is thin and the inking is gray and not a crisp black and white, making it tough to read.I placed it side by side with my wife's 1995 leather bound Zondervan study bible and the difference was night and day.Her pages were easy-to-read, contrasty black and white. Mine, washed out gray.OK for younger eyes maybe, but skip this if you're older. Save up for a better edition.Free shipping service was terrible. It took about two weeks to get my order.RD, South Dakota"
1,Kindle NIV too hard to use,"Got my first Kindle for Christmas. The first book I tried to read on it is this NIV Study Bible. The Paper version of this book is fantastic. The Kindle version is nearly useless. Very dissapointing first Kindle experience. Downloaded a Max Lucado book and no trouble. Not the NIV Study Bible, still trying to actually find the beginning of the Bible. Forewards, Contents, Maps all come first. Cant find anyway to jump to any particular chapter or verse. Since I am new to Kindle I don't know if I can, but if it is possible I will return this and find something else."
2,NIV Study Bible,"I have this Bible in book form. It is my primary study Bible. I was really disappointed when I purchased it for my Kindle. Maybe I missed something, but in my opinion for this to be useful there needs to be better search and navigation tools. Just to go to a specific chapter and verse was difficult and time consuming.More work needs to be done to make this a viable reference tool as an eBook. I chose to return it and I hope that there is an improved update on the queue.If I did miss it in my evaluation and just did not figure it out, maybe the publisher should provide a page or 2 tutorial."
1,Pretty worthless ebook,"I spent a lot of money (as far as ebooks go) on Zondervan's NIV Study Bible, but it is less useful than most of the free or $1.00 Bibles I have downloaded. Can't search book and chapter. Can't even do a word search! STAY AWAY FROM THIS EBOOK. Zondervan, I want a refund. PLEASE RESPOND!"
4,Kindle Dx User....,"I've read the reviews. And While I wish kindle had all of the shortcuts inline so one could go back and forth, to any chapter etc...I know this is a monumental task. But Having done it myself for other books I feel publisher's should take the time so I don't have to.That said. Might I suggest using the search function more? I have no problems finding verses by using the first three words usually. I know It's not a fix but it's something.I too look forward to a truly well kindle version of this book that mirrors the functionality of the original hardcopy."
2,Type Too Small,I ordered this to replace an earlier edition. The new edition is packed with new content. The problem is that it is too small to read easily. So I returned it.
1,Very disappointed,"I automatically bought this version of the Bible because I trust Zondervan and love the NIV. I wish I had read the reviews before buying as I've been so disappointed.It is very difficult to navigate and I've found I just don't use it. I was hoping to be able to read the Bible on the bus on the way to work and just to have it for easy access but there is nothing easy about using this Bible. I've found no way to going to a specific book, chapter, and verse. You can use the location numbers but you don't know where that will lead you.I would like a refund from Zondervan."
2,Very limited in Kindle,"I got the kindle primarily for bible study and immediately got the kindle version of my trust NIV study bible. I was soon very disappointed with how limited it is. The concordance and topical search is unusable unless you have hours to flip from page to page. I got the ESV version just to see how a usable version looks on kindle. I even emailed zondervan to complain and got an answer that basically said ""do the best you can with it, it's still very good"". I hear a new version is coming out soon in 2011, maybe it will be better."
2,Zondervan NIV Study Bible Updated Edition,"I have a Zondervan NIV Study Bible that I use all the time. I particulary like the study notes. It helps so much to understand the traditions, the meaning of words as used in that time, the people. I could not get to the study notes on my Kindle edition. So I called Kindle to find out how to find them. Guess what, I was told, after the Kindle person read about the book, the author didn't include the study notes in this version. Well, with no study notes included, it is not a Study Bible. It is a Zondervan NIV Bible. I so miss the study notes. So now when I am at home, I have gone back to reading and studying in the hand held Bible. Only when going to church do I tuck the Kindle in and take it for the verses. Even then I miss not being able to look at the study notes while discussing or thinking about a verse. Not happy with that at all. Misleading title."
5,Awesome,I am new in my study of the Bible and this Bible has an amazing amount of information and lots of references to make things clear. It is written in wonderful language and very easy to follow.I love this and read it every day.
4,Can't easily figure out which book I'm in...,"Though this version is significantly better for study purposes than the other free bibles I've downloaded (and should be, for $20), it still lacks something very simple: a constant visual cue as to which book and chapter I'm reading from. (This gets confusing, for example, as I work through the synoptic gospels via links and lose track as to where I currently am.)"
4,Hard Cover All the Way,"I honestly really love this version of the Bible. Sticking primarily to the product, I was really happy about the condition that the product arrived in....shrink wrapped and placed in a proper box. The bible itself has a great text size, annotations in text and a fantastic concordance attached. If you are looking to start in depth bible exposition, this is a great bible to begin this journey. I would have like the product to have had less packaging however, It seemed like the package was ready for a battle with the elements and not just a trip with UPS.THanks"
4,"Bought for my mom, she really likes it",I bought this for my mom and she says it a very nice bible. I can't go into details because I have never used it. She enjoys the large print and all the cross-references.
5,Zondervan NIV Study Bible,"I bought this Bible for my granddaughter, who is in college. Upon receiving it, I reviewed the pages and found it to be one of the better study Bibles. It had every thing right there with explanations for the verses. It was just what I was looking for. Thank you for having it in your inventory."
2,More Editing Would Be a Start,I borrowed this book for practice to retake my ACT. Some of the strategies are actually okay. The problem is the practice exams. The answer explanations that the give really don't make sense and are debatable. I suggest Barron's or the Princeton Review as opposed to this book.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I am begging you not to buy this book, I am a highschool junior trying to prepare for The ACT's so I was taking the Diagnostic Test at the begining of the book and in checking my answers I realized that I had WAY too many wrong answers, so i checked the Answer Explanations for one of the questions I got wrong, the question was and I quote ""The original price of a computer was $1200. What was the price of the computer after two 10% mark downs?"" F. $960 G. $972 H. $980 J. $1,000 K. $1,072 The correct answer would be of course G. $972. So I went to check my answers in the back of the book and it tells me the correct answer is F $960. I dont understand how this is possibly true so I go to the Explanations where it says (and again I quote): ""Marking down $1,200 by 10% reduces the price by 10% of 1,200=120. The new price is 1200-120=1080. Marking that down 10% reduces the price by 10% of 1080=108, so the final price is 1080-108=972"" This is answer G not F!!"
3,unexpected trouble,"Young Jody Baxter is lonely in his isolated home in the Southern Florida scrub. When he discovers an abandoned fawn he finds the companionship he was longing for, but with it come some unexpected problems.The yearling has many suspenseful hunts and beautiful descriptions of the scrub. However, Majorie Kinnan Rawlings bogged the story down with Jody's emotions which drew out the story.No matter what your age, if you enjoy rambling in the woods and taking in nature's beauty, this is the book you have been looking for."
3,"A Simple, Predictable Tale","The Yearling isn't so much flawed as it is, well- just there. The tale of the young boy in Florida is a cute, well-told tale that comes off as a bit simple. While the title obviously suggests a book about a boy and his deer, the more interesting parts of the book revolve around the boys neighbors and the politics of sparce living. But Rawlings retreats to the boy and his wild pet as the vignette for the book's lessons, and you can guess what happens there.While a good (not a great) book, I have to wonder if a tale this bland would ever win the Pulitzer Prize now."
1,Yuck!,This smells gross and old ladyish and musky. not at all fruity like i thought it would be. all of the other DKNY Be delicious scents are amazing especially the green one. so i thought this would surely be as fruity as the other ones but its totally different. GO SMELL BEFORE YOU BUY. so you know whether your wasting your sixty dollars or not. thats annother thing. a pricey perfume that stinks? bad idea.
5,Brilliant!! Amazing! Delightful!!,"Reese has done so many things, but Playing Elle woods was masterful. The upbeat looks, the great expressions, the great Timing. Wonderful writing, great delivery and masterful performance. The cast in both movies are nothing short of brilliant. Reese Witherspoon is America's sweetheart and these movies will show you why and will show you how great an actress she truly is. An American Icon not only in Reese but in Elle Woods as well. Whenever I feel down I pop in the dvd or watch the instant video of Elle woods and Legally Blond and Reese always cheers me up. A must see pair of Movies for everyone. Fun Family movie as well."
4,Entertaining,"Reese Witherspoon excels at playing Ellie, a blond, fashion-conscious young woman who goes from being a spoiled rich girl intent on marrying a rich guy to a lawyer willing to take on the big guys. Both movies deliver important messages with plenty of humor. I definitely prefer the first movie over the sequel, but both are worth watching."
1,GROSS - see Reese Witherspoon in Freeway instead,"These two movies are so lame and there wasn't much else in the theaters when they came out which helped the box office success. These are tacky stories and not going to encourage anyone to knuckle down and do what needs to get done to get into a good school. Also, show your daughter Penelope which Reese Witherspoon produced."
4,DVD review,"I really enjoy both these movies. I am very disappointed in MGM as they say the first movie has special features, yet none are available on ANY DVD that I have seen. The cover of the DVD shows special features are with the DVD, such as deleted scenes, etc., yet the original movie only has commentary with it as its ""special feature"". The second movie does have some of the features listed.The two movies are very entertaining and just fun to watch."
4,The Shyest 'Kid in the Patch,"This was wonderful in good condition.Very nice, and it will make a certain child very happy.This book, too, was not in any other book store I shopped, and they could not order it, because they said it was out of print.I was so very happy to find it!"
2,felt this book was not helpful,I felt the book was based on mothers singing career. I excepted the book to be more helpful as far as autism
4,autobiography,"please know this is Eustacia's life story...not temple gradin's. that said, it is a wonderful and well written autobiography by a quite an interesting lady!"
3,a few excellent bits -,a few excellent pages on parent dealing with autism.. then becomes a generic life story
2,same as all others,"I have read several books on families that have a least 1 child that is autistic and this is no different. The only thing, i found interesting is that this mother seemed to be more invovled with her child and encourged her then just pushing away."
1,Did not work when received,The item was defective when received. Called Nady service and they walked me through some troubleshooting before informing me that it needed to be returned. Decided to purchace a different brand.
5,"Fantastic, easy inspirational read","What a great book! Very short stories in diary form that take you to so many places around the world. The stories make you want to travel, make you feel proud to be a Woman and made me very motivated to continue planning my first girls adventure vacation. Would absolutely recommend!"
3,decent for price,the whole assembly of the dart needs to be screwed together after each time you throw one but that may be just how darts are. These are pretty durable and work.
5,Fun for grownups too,"I'm a fan of urban legends, and have read Dr. Brunvan's books, so I picked this up for my son. We had a good time reading it (its gross in some parts, but he didn't mind!) also has an chapter by Dr.Brunvan. I'd recommend it."
2,Cheap,The bow and arrow set was not exactly what I thought it was. I guess for the price minus shipping is about all it was worth.
3,cheap arrows,"it was a hit for my 4 yr old @ christmas. although the suction cups on the arrows were bent when molded i guess & they will not suction to anything. the bow is good for the price. was a lil disappointed w/ the arrows, but if the 4 yr old is happy, so am i."
1,Micro tek pet shampoo.,"After reading all the reviews I went ahead and ordered this shampoo, I usually buy Resicort which works great with the oatmeal shampoo. Micro tek did nothing for my cat bat made her smell good, she was scratching and licking away the very next day. Very disappointed with this shampoo."
3,This may help :-),"Fellow dog lovers. It may be possible that your dog is allergic to processed dog food such as kibble. Along with skin itching, our dog had red eyes filled with goop that had to be wiped away several times every day.When we switched from processed store bought dog food to raw fresh food our dogs overall health and energy improved Dramatically. No more sctratching, no more goop in his eyes at all and his coat really shines! :-)As our vet says, ""Dogs survive on kibble but thrive on a raw diet ""One last thing. A raw food diet is EXPENSIVE and time consuming. It costs $80 per month to feed our 40lb dog and you can expect to spend two hours per month preparing the food packets."
4,This works,This stuff works great on my dogs dandruff which is a huge problem but the smell is overwhelming for the first 24 hours...don't know if its worth it...
1,don't work,My dogs still suffer from skin problem even after a couple times of bath with this shampoo. Tea tree oil worked so much better on itching problem.
3,Friend recommended,"A dear friend recommends this shampoo very highly. It works well on her dog and her horse, but unfortunately it didn't work on my dog, so she'll get my bottle. Worth the try."
2,Not as promised!,"This shampoo came highly recommended to me to help my dog's itchy skin. Not only has it not helped his itching it has not helped the odor problem either! He smells worse after two days than he did before! BTW - my dog does not have an active skin infection at this time, so can't blame the stink on that. I have tried it twice on him with the same results. Definitely not worth the money."
5,Great product,"I have 2 grown labs with very sensitive skin. This shampoo does wonders for their skin and coat. And it has a great smell, also.Use it all year long."
5,Question to other posts,Do any of you use just the shampoo without the spray? and does it work fine without it?
5,Micro tek,Fantastic product. It has made my Cocker Spaniel able to have a much more comfortable life. Don't know what we would do without it.
4,Starting To Work,I have a Cocker Spaniel that has been scratching himself constantly. He would have an odor three days after a bath. He had little wart-like sores on his back that would flake off. The Vet prescribed steroids which helped for awhile. I did not want him to be on medication all the time. I changed his food to California Natural (no yeast) and started to bathe him with Micro-Tek. His scratching has improved 60% and he no longer has an odor or flaky sores. It's been two months and I think that we are on a road to recovery.
1,Overpowering smell,This shampoo has an overpowering smell that just masks the smell of the yeast infection. It did not help my dog. I have wrote the company about the guarantee but have not received a response.
3,so far no progress with itch problems,"I bought this at a local pet store yesterday, it was 2 dollars more expensive than here. I was desperate to solve an itching problem with my allergic dog. I was not hopeful the shampoo would solve the issue but desperate enough to try. They also reccomended the hotspot spray but I decided to wait on that to see if the shampoo makes any difference. This shampoo with one use did not improve itching at all. I have to use benedryl instead. I am going to use this shampoo until it runs out. Perhaps it is soothing to the skin and it does leave a nice coat. The smell is mild and slightly medicated. Probably would not purchase again seeing it did not fix problem I bought it to target."
2,"Has a nice scent, but didn't work for my dog","I had high hopes for this product, given the reviews. However, my dog continued to scratch, bite and lick after I bathed him with this product. The fragrance is nice, but it is rather expensive to buy for just a normal shampoo. I am not sure what my dog is allergic to, I am guessing grass, but whatever the case this didn't seem to work for him."
1,Tried Shampoo & Spray - Neither Worked,I tried the Shampoo and the Spray... neither did anything. Absolutely no effect... nor could I say they were any different or better than any other products I've tried... Sorry... but that's my story... Good reviews and certainly worth the try... I hope these Micro-Tek products really are helpful for others.
3,Cool Cars Carrier,"This car carrier/racetrack is very cool! We ordered 2 to hold our collection of Disney/Pixar's Supercharged series of dicast metal cars and we are very pleased with it. The set spaces for the particular cars are great. Our only disappointment in it is that a lot of the cars we have are not ones that go with the decals on the spaces in the case. Of course we knew that when we got it but still, it would have been nice if they offered our own decals to place on for the whole set of cars available. They did however provide us with the most popular car decals so that was nice. Overall, I am very pleased with the cases."
4,Another tool for viewmaster collection beginners,"For those just beginning a viewmaster collection, this can be a handy tool. The only major fault I find with it is that it does not have an index in the back, making it more difficult to locate information about a specific item. But it is less costly than some of the viewmaster books and beginners often don't know the name or model number of a particular viewer or reel anyway, so it's not as big an issue as you might think. The photos are excellent and the authors are quite knowledgeable about viewmaster as a whole. It was worth the money."
1,Bland and Boring,"I bought this to read on a flight hoping that it would be better than ""The Chairman"" by the same author, but it was more of the same bland boring drivel that could very well have been written by an average high school student. The dialog is not believable, the characters have no depth, and by not very far through I just didn't care what happened to any of them. When you eventually slog through to the end there's no real conclusion, and the last few chapters could really just be replaced with ""Suddenly everything magically and boringly worked out, and the good guys lived happily ever after"".If you liked ""The Chairman"" then this may be just what you're looking for, but I can't give this a low enough rating."
2,"OK, But .....","I was pretty disappointed with this effort by Stephen Frey. After awhile mentioning billions as if it has any meaning to the average reader, makes my eyes glaze over. The supposed good guy, Christian, is set up and fooled on a regular basis. If he is this gullible how did he become such a financial wizard? Too many unexplained happenings. He swims in icy Maine waters and his shoes don't squish? Is he wearing shoes? Don't his clothes drip all over the place. No, no and no. The author fills up a lot of pages and has a secret club a power club that has been written about many times before. It is an old plot idea and one can only hope this type of organization does not actually exist. If it does, expect your brain to be pulled out through your nose; the fate of one hapless character. Don't waste your time. I suffered so that you would not!"
4,So many characters by lots of plot here!,This is a book my mother-in-law left for me to read when she was here at the end of October. I had never read anything by this author before. The book was much better than I had expected! There are lots of characters to keep track of so you do have to concentrate when you read it. I enjoyed the twists and turns. It's also not the typical medical mystery book I am so fond of so that was a nice change too. I will seek out other books by this author in the future.
2,The protege is much better!,This book is the sequence of the Protege. I recommend the original book!
2,What happened to Stephen Frey?,"I used to enjoy each new Stephen Frey story, but the last two have been mostly the meglomania of the ""hero."" How can we rejoice as he ruins lives, bankrupts pension plans for his own gain, and (now) has his eye on the country for even greater political glories?I hope that a humbled Stephen Frey comes back to his base.He was once a near-master of the financial thriller, but lately he has lost my interest and my principal."
1,Forget it.,This book was not clever or funny or well catergorized. You can find much better material on the web for free.I was looking for appropriate toasts for Thanskgiving. This book did not help. I threw it away.
4,Perfect to get started,Great set for beginning to use a pedometer everyday. My wife and I have been excited and motivated to get out and walk since receiving ours at Christmas. This one is inexpensive enough for a gift or perfect for personal use.
1,Unresolved,This item was never received. I'd forgotten about it until I received this. Can you please look into this? Thank you.Cheryl Lopatka231-843-7920
4,A guilty pleasure...,"Ok, ok, ok... I know. Rating this with 4 stars might look like being sick, but it still brings up some wonderful school memories, I can't resist to enjoy back again.However, watching the bonus DVD just makes me feel a little embarrassed...If you're in it for the music creativity, it will be really disappointing. Recommended just for fun and your ""guilty pleasures"" playlist =)"
5,Loco Mine,It was great to find this classic DVD of one of my all time favorite 80's Spanish groups. Check it out for yourself!
5,Plenty of power,"I have this hooked to a 12"" sony xplod subwoofer and it is fenominal!! All the power i could need and more. Though it says it only has 150 x 2 rms it actually has closer to 450 rms bridged at 4 ohms. This is no lie or gimmic- this amp definitly performs like a 500 watt amp. I would reccomend this amp along with the sony xplod subwoofer to anyone looking into a sub and amp set that wont break the bank ($190 total)."
4,Worth What I Paid,"After losing a hearing aid, I bought this device to help tide me over until I am ready to spend big bucks for a replacement. I tried it in a small-group meeting of ten people, and I could hear everyone fine. I've been using it in watching t.v.--so as not to blow my wife away with decibels--and I am satisfied with its performance in that regard. I avoided the earpiece pictured with this unit here, since it looks clumsy, and got one with a simple earbud and a headset. Haven't tried the headset, but the earbud is comfortable and works fine. I'd bet that a lot of competing products are simply junk, but I find this one to represent value representative of the cost. At least it's worth the money for me, even though there is no substitute for a good hearing aid except another good hearing aid."
1,It overheats!,"I actually have the DDR version but it is now fried. I simply had it too close to the soundcard and played Ultima 9, bad idea! and it overheated and fried. I could tell because the graphics got fuzzy like mist or snow, especially when I used my mouse. If you get this card do NOT overclock it! Fatal error! As for performance it is no better than the Diamond Viper 770(non Ultra) that is a TNT2 card. The Viper has given me no problems it does not overheat even next to the PCI sound card. I would give the Prophet more stars but the DDR version is supposed to be better and it is worse than my old card. Don't play Ultima 9 and keep your TNT2(if you have one)"
2,This card is OK,"This card is OK if all you do is play quake 3. If you decide on playing other OpenGL or Glide games, this is terrible. When I got it, i could not play Unreal Tournament on it, one of my favorite games, due to lack of Rave and Glide support. The so called AntiAliasing is TERRIBLE. There are still plenty of jagged lines when you play. This is why i returned it and bought a Voodoo 5. I expected much better from nVidia. I guess 3Dfx wins this match."
1,Bad card under Windows 2000 and Unreal Tournament,I bought this card after owning a Creative TNT2 (which I was very happy with) expecting the same level of compatibility with my games (most notably Unreal Tournament) under Windows 2000. Not the case UT looked like hell and only ran under D3D (bad bad Open GL is usually much better). I needed to obtain some kind of firmware update which after downloading it I discovered in the README file that it would only run under DOS compatibility mode which does not exist under Windows NT and 2000. What did the company tell me: get a DOS boot disk. Where? I don't have a DOS based machine -- so instead I returned the card and got a Voodoo 5 which runs UT GREAT! and is very stable. Don't waste your time with this piece of garbage.
3,Well...,"Take into consideration several things about why you would buy this kind of card or not. Start with this, does it support Glide? small but important, as most games use it, and some games (like unreal tournament) won't play without it. Second, can you get something better for a relatively close price? think about 3DFX's Voodoo 5 5500 AGP. It has 64mb of video ram, against the 32 on this board, and a very nice dual set of video processors for $300. And 3DFX is know to support Open GL, Direct 3D and GLIDE! . My final word? if you don't mind about not having enough memory on your video card and not being able to play some games, go for this one. Otherwise, i'd probably go for the Voodoo 5 6000! (which by the way has 128mb video ram and 4 3D processors to make up a very powerfull board)"
4,"Pretty good Card, but there are better ones.","It's significantly faster than the TNT2 Ultra, and performs just as well as a GeForce DDR at lower resolutions. Unfortunately, having normal SDRAM really hurts the Prophet at higher resolutions where memory bandwidth is an issue. For this price, you might have to consider the geforce gts card instead."
3,NEUTRAL,"I've done ALOT of research on the newest and brightest of cards and this happens to be the ""choice"" of the online reviews.I've also got friends that ""always have to compete with the jones'"" and they also rave about the sli stuff that ""brings out the detail that the programers didn't count on."" HA! If your not getting this card for cosmetic ego boosting upgrade I would wait abit for the ""wooops suddenly not the best"" price drop. Although please dont buy a VOODOO5 5500 or the ""oh my GOD gonna be expensive"" VOODOO5 6000."
4,Great card but is it worth the money with all the new cards,This card is exceelent the colors are out of this world but it could be a little less expensive considering the geforce2 gts is already on the market and its much faster and only costs slightly more. Yet I still give this 4 stars because it is an excellent card. And if your looking for a very good card this is it.
5,This thing rocks!,"Netgear is slowly starting to invade my home network. all I need to do is change my router and it's pure netgear. The reason I wrote that is because Netgear is a good company, therefore one would think that this router would be a great product. Well, You're right! I had this set up in 20-30 minutes. no small feat for attaching a router. this thing flies, there's virtually no slowdown for the connection, with DSL it's great. overall, this is a nearly flawless product and in a world of plastic cars, computers and women, the metal case makes it that much better."
2,major problem with pppoe and some isps,i have been using the rt311 for some months now and was loving it except for the annoyance of having to reboot it about every month. it turns out the problem is due to the fact that the router does not reestablish the pppoe connection if it is ever dropped. my isp (earthlink/mindspring dsl) has recently been dropping the connections more frequently so i now have to reboot it between every couple of days and a week. thus i have no internet connection unless i am there to reboot it (i finally wrote a script to do this). after talking to a gaggle of customer service reps they all told me that it is the isps problem and that the only way of correcting is to manually reboot. i finally found out that they may be working on a fix but there is no eta. this might be a nice product when they finally get around to updating the bios to correct this serious problem.
2,Not a good choice for VPN,"I have used this router for about 6 mos. Initially satisfied, but then tried inbound VPN access, and found that even with static port/address mappings, connection drops in 5 to 10 minutes. Wife uses DSL for outbound VPN to office, and connection will drop after about 10 minutes. Replaced with Linksys BEFSR41 (with no static maps, no special configuration) and VPN works fine. Netgear support says I need to open 3 ports, change her client DNS, etc. Didn't do any of this with Linksys."
2,Nothing more then common sense,"The title of this book is misleading, as it does not offer much in terms of helpful advice rather a sampling of horror stories from various misguided community associations. The book is also disappointingly short, I almost felt like I was reading an edition of ""Reader's Digest"". The author compiled the book mostly though articles published by the CAI which are available to any member and it is pretty obvious that the author is more of a scholar then someone with hands on experience in dealing with the problems of troubled homeowner associations. This book is also more focused on homeowner associations, not condo associations so all the urban dwellers might need to look elsewhere."
1,DID NOT fullfill what it was advertised as,I was veary dissapointed as were other board members. From ad on your web site we thought it would give us some help in enforcing the rules and regulations ands all the book does is tell you how to make the rules easier and nothing about how to enforce them. VERY DISSAPOINTED & do not believe I will believe your web site again.
5,No Maintenance,I've used other back up sump pump batteries that I had to constantly add water to. This one is maintenance free. 'nough said!
2,Just a very average fantasy!,"All books have their good things, bad things, and annoying things.Personally, I think this book has good character development. It has rich lore, a good plot, and good world-building.However, those things that are good...are overshadowed by those that are bad or annoying.Characters seemingly develop abilities out of thin air. The long lost XXX, YYY, and ZZZ...which have been thought lost for thousands of years, just pour back on to the scene out of nowhere. (I hate this type of storytelling)With that said, a good portion of the dialogue is just bad. It does not snap. It does not pop. And, sometimes, I asked myself if the character speaking made sense.Lastly, some of the key figures seemed out of place, character, and oftentimes...out of their senses.Unfortunately, this leads me to rate this novel a 2 out of 5."
3,"Entertains, but nothing special","Ms Douglass ia an academic and it shows in a well structured and thought out book. The trouble is that this book travels a well worn path and while it does entertain, it does not stand out. There is the usual prophecy and the 'chosen one' who struggles to come to terms with who he is, there is the 'evil' sweeping in from the cold North and the latent magic in the land. Nothing unusual there, but it is still quite a readable book and will while away an hour or two. I would have to say (at the risk of having sexist views) that it had quite a strong female touch with a little more empathy and emotion then perhaps I was expecting. The character eventually named as 'Tree Friend' who is the lead female in the story, communicates with trees and is a sort of friend of the earth who is linked to a magical mother figure. A bit deep for us blokes that want lots of sword fights and shagging!Not a bad entry onto a flooded market but not an outstanding one either."
2,A dull and uninteresting read,"I can't understand why this book recieved such high marks. I found nothing to like in any of the characters. Faraday, the ""heroine"" seems to jump from being witty and strong willed on one page, to a whiny, naive, little girl on the next. Not only that, the man she ""falls in love with"" (it seems more like puppy love to me) is equally unlikeable. Douglass seems to want us to believe that Borneheld, her betrothed, is an ""evil"" man that Faraday would suffer miserably with, but she give no examples to support his unsuitability. There was very little character development and frankly I didn't find any of her characters likeable at all except for perhaps Lady Embeth.The only reason this book gets even two stars is the slightly interesting history of Achar. Really though, I wouldn't waste my money purchasing this book. If you want a good read, pick up the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, or the Shannara series by Terry Brooks."
3,Fantasy soap opera,"Just finished reading the canadian edition of Battle Axe and found it just like a soap opera. Character development follows the same type of twist and turns as a TV soap opera. Little consistency and forced surprises. The fantasy elements are there so it qualifies as fantasy fiction. I must say I'm enjoying the second book a lot more, even though the soap opera quality still lingers. I'll read all the six books so it must say that I like soap operas. I don't believe this series will be remembered after a few years. I do hope that the author developes her themes for a more sofisticated audience in the future."
2,I Finished it.,"I finished it, and that's the only reason this book gets 2 stars. I just could not really get into it. I bought this book before reading it, since i enjoyed Hade's Daughter and God's Concubine so much. Bad idea.It was slow, and the love story(what love story there was) was just not believable. I liked Azhure better then Faraday, but they were both alright characters. There just wasn't a whole lot in this book that grabbed me."
2,"Good idea, but...","The idea is original, and the characters are dynamic, but the writing is shoddy. The author, while obviously imaginative enough to concoct such a story, falls down on her style and usage by literally making up words. The noun form of ""perplexed"" is not ""perplexion""; it's perplexity. A person does not ""dangle"" a child on his knee, but dandles it. One can only assume that the editor was asleep while reading this book, as well as those that follow."
2,Skip the series but not the author,"I'm fortunate in that I discovered Sara Douglass through the Crucible series and the Troy Game series before I tried ""Wayfarer Redemption"". It was the breathtaking strength and creativity of those books (and the upcoming wait for the final book in each series) that motivated me to find out what else she had written.I was thrilled that she had so many other books for me to enjoy while waiting for Troy and Crucible to be completed, so I grabbed the first volume, ""Wayfarer Redemption"". Such a disappointment!And it was not because my expectations were too high from her other books. There was no hint of that author in this book. This was merely a predictable and poorly written boilerplate fantasy. I didn't bother with the last 50 pages.But try her Troy Game and Crucible series - they're worth your time!"
5,Page turner!,"I loved this book, I couldn't stop reading it! I found myself reading it in my commute to and from work and at lunch. If you like reading about magical beings and places, and he fight between good and bad you will love this trilogy."
1,Felt unclean - and offended - after finishing this one,"This is not a complaint about the writing style as so many other of the bad reviews have been, this is about the message I could not help but feel Douglas was trying to convey.I think a lot of readers forget that authors try to present not only an interesting story, but their ideals conserning the real world as well. For instance, Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" is filled with the heroes who are self sacrificing and valiant in the face of definitive evil. After reading this book, however, I think Douglas has one twisted and disturbing sence of morality.The book takes that which most people with any sort of traditional values would find morally offensive and tries to portray them as ""good"" and tries to get the reader to feel sympathy for those engaging in such behavior.Anyway, if you want characters that have some sort of moral fiber to them, I'd strongly recommend skipping this one."
2,Overhyped,"The glowing description and review made me interested checking this book out ~ I read everything in fantasy, especially new stuff. I have to say that perhaps being the most successful fantasy author from Australia has not helped Sara Douglass here in America. The plot is standard stuff, and reads like a bad cartoon, with Faraday being a wimpish heroine that makes some pretty patheric choices. I also hate prophecys that just out of nowhere predict things as plot devices.On the whole, this is a pretty amateurish book. It does not live up to the hype."
4,Good start,"The problem with the first book in any finite series is that it has to rope you in, but also must leave a lot of threads for the remainder of the series. Douglass has it all covered. Enough of the plot is revealed to get you interested in the rest of the story."
2,"Dumb women, cardboard men","It would have been nice if Sara Douglass had tried a little harder to give her characters a little depth. Faraday is a continual victim, Axis the earnest, underappreciated hero, and Borneheld the typical villan. I can watch Dudley Dooright, Nell Fenwick and Snidely Whiplash if I want that.This book has some promise in the description of the people of the plough and their outlook, but the rest is grating. The prophecy at the beginning told me everything that happened in the story without having to read it, and everything that will continue to do so. I will not bother, however."
4,"The wayfarer Redemption (The Axis Trilogy, Bk 1",Was my first time to read one of this authors books. I will continue to read the series. I liked this book alot.
3,About face,"For a change,this sequel series has been published in the UK before the USA.During it,nearly all the characters seem to show very unpleasant sides and the series does not seem to flow well from the earlier series.Often,you are left shaking your head in disbelief as the heroes stagger from one self-induced crisis to the next.If you can stay with the series,everything turns out OK,though with 21/2 books of crisis and 1/2 book solution,it all happens too quickly.Also room for further sequels"
5,BattleAxe,"It's a great book, I live in Australia and yes it is true - all the books are out in Australia. The author hates Faraday with a passion but wasn't allowed to kill her off... It's excellent fantasy, to all those who think it retreads old ground..all the ground it retreads makes it fantasy, not some indefineable muck. It's new enough for me!"
1,Don't do it!,"My review is based off the entire series rather than just this book. While the series started out great, it begins to turn bad around the 4th book. It becomes apparently obvious that Sara Douglass does not like Faraday and exchanges her for Azhure. Faraday will continue to suffer betrayals as the series progresses. I was so disgusted with the series that I threw it in the trash. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind reading about twists and new love interests, but this went too far. I would recommend reading the reviews that are not spoilers on the 6th book-the last, that way you can determine if this is a good purchase. Borrow it if that is an option."
2,Your typical by-the-numbers fantasy series,"If you like your fantasy with not a whole lot of depth and plenty of predictability, this seems to be the series for you. I've just read the first book, and I didn't see much here to get me to pick up any more. The characters are nothing to write home about and I can't get too invested in the plot. It isn't horrible, but it doesn't really break new ground either."
4,Great book for a great read. =),"Although personally, this wasn't the best book in the series, i think that it is a fab book and hard to put down. It is richly satifying for those science-fiction and the characters are easy to empathise with. The plot is good, with the proper amounts of twists and mystery.I fully recommend all of Sara Douglass's books, and she is a great author."
4,entertaining,I found this book to be very enjoyable. Parts of it are a bit drawn out and predictable but it is definitely a good read.
2,Why the hype?,"This is a modestly interesting read. The writing is amateurish, and the story, while engaging in parts, is standard fantasy fare, and not very well done. I found myself cringing at the silly names and the sometimes juvenile dialogue.I did find myself drawn in until Faraday's choice [don't want to spoil it] and after that it was downhill.I am tired of seeing every new book by each new author that comes down the pike hailed like the New Era of Fantasy is upon us. This is a tired retread, an Australian import that is not up to American standards of fantasy, in my opinion. That's not meant to be snotty; I would be hard pressed to name an American book that was up to British standards of fantasy.In short, don't bother with this. Read Lewia, Williams, Tolkien, Pratchett, or, if you must, Hobb, Williams, Martin, Haydon and Carroll."
4,Much Better than Average,"I read this book before having read the reviews. I had never heard of Sara Douglass. While I don't really prefer prophesy-based stories, and thought the ""Sentinels"" a substandard device, I thought the characters in this one more than made up for that deficiency. They don't act from the same motives that modern characters might, but isn't that a plus for a fantasy novel? Their motives are consistent with the setting. I plan to read the others in the series."
1,Unimaginative & Predictable,"This book was terrible. It cured me of pursuing the series any further. The plot was extremely predictable, leaving the reader to plod through several hundred pages of rambling, inane text. In several instances, the battle scenes are omitted from the story. Plus, the author's idea of foreshadowing pretty much eliminates any possibility of suspense. The book is a waste of time. If you like adventure, excitement, and good battles, this book is a rip off."
2,Marginal,"I was looking for some originality here, based on the reviews, but I have to say that this is pretty much a rehash of concepts, characters, plot devices and tropes that I have seen before. The writing style is maddening from time to time, shifting focus several times within a single paragraph. And the use of prophecy as a plot device in unoriginal and lame. I also found the dialog to be particularly grating.In fairness to the author, perhaps I was expecting more because of all the hype these books have received, since they have a track record in Australia. Some parts of them are even interesting, but the problem is that as soon as I was starting to think ok. this is getting better, something extremely dumb comes along and throws us back to square one.I cannot imagine wanting to read any more of these."
2,Mediocre series,Being a lover of series fantasy I was disappointed with this. It seemed superficial and the pacing was slow. Few character viewpoints were explored. Yet the story and world kept me interested enough to buy the second book. Was that a mistake. It plodded through an utterly predicitible plot with the only character development increasing my dislike for all of the characters- each of whom is completely one-sided. Also there was basically one plot line followed too neatly from begining to end with no change in character viewpoint or setting leaving no room for suspense. I won't finish the series.
2,Mediocre fantasy,"This book held my interest sufficiently to pass the time, but did not inspire me. Numerous elements of the novel came across to me as pale imitations of George R.R. Martin's epic series, for example the coming winter, the cold-aided enemies, the illigetimate hero... The prophecy and the plot ""twists"" were fairly predictable - ain't no surprises in this book! The characters are not terribly interesting, either - haven't we heard the ""love-triangle"" plot just a few too many times? Oh well! Maybe the next books will be an improvement, but I'll just wait to check them out from the library."
4,Good Solid Epic Fantasy,I loved this book. The characters are rich and the story is moving which keeps you urning each page and wishing somehow that you could read faster. If you enjoy fantasy you'll love Douglass' new and inventive races and vivid descriptions. She plays with a constant hint of mysticism based closely to the pagan religions of our world. I found this additionally pleasing as it gave me additional insite into the actions of her characters.Great book!
5,Neverending adventure!,"I must say this is one of my favorite books. It's not like many other books where the plot is really good then really boring, something is always happening in this book. It always keeps you thinking about what's going to happen next. New storylines are constantly being revealed but these storylines intertwine in such a creative way. A must read if you like adventure and love."
3,Not completely baked,"The Pros: The book is an easy read and there are some good ideas in it.the cons: The shift in character perspective is lousy. It is not relegated to chapters or even paragraphs, but can happen within the next sentence! There are areas that need a little fine-tuning. For example, it is not clear to me the ""limits"" of Axis' powers (book 2). Can he read minds? Can he heal? Can he ""resurrect""? What is tiring to him and what is not?That being said, it is worth reading if you have no really great books in mind (George RR Martin's books, etc.)"
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I've gotten wary of fantasy lately. I buy a book that sounds like is has great characters and plot, only to find it muddied by unneccesary graphic sex and graphic language. I took a chance with ""A Wayfarer Redemption"" partly because the author wasn't from the United States, and had such a good rep in Australia.I really enjoyed the story, and found it hard to put down. Sara successfully weaves several points of view together to tell her story, only taking a misstep into author's voice once or twice. Most of the characters are well-drawn and multi-level.I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in the set."
4,A definite page turner,"Over the years I have begun to become a bit more picky with my authors. Sara did not disappoint me with this book. I'll agree with another reviewer that she did not come out as strong as Jordan or Martin, but she brought to light a quality story. The action wasn't always as hot as it could be, but in the beginning of a story of this size an author needs to slow down some to bring in as much initial background as possible.That said... I loved the book. I gave it 4 stars only because book 2 was definitely a 5. I took away enough of what I wanted in this book to make me want to buy the next book in the series.I find Sara's writing to have enough originality, emotion, and inspiration to recommend her writing."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"My wife bought this book after seieng an ad for it in Romantic Times, then didn't like it, because it wasn't romantic. So she gave it to me, and I didn't like it, because it wasn't particularly good fantasy or writing.The cover art is beautiful, and it is an expensive looking book, but the money that was put into making it look so should have been spent editing it better, or whatever. The cover text sounded great, but the reality is that too much relies on the Prophecy and characters who are not appealing or interesting.Not recommended."
3,Solid foundation for an excellent series,"I have actually read all the books in the Wayfarer Redemption, so know what this book leads to. This is the second published fantasy book the author put out, so is still a little amateurish, but it is a solid foundation for what becomes an enthralling series. The characters, while still a little one dimensional, will soon grow into the promise that they show.The second trilogy is even better, one of the only series I have read where the lead characters have their weaknesses thoroughly explored. And if you think these are good, just wait until you can get your hands on The Crucible!!! And Threshold has to be read to be believed."
2,Gave up halfway through,"At least I bought the edition that only cost 4 dollars. Otherwise it would've been a big waste of money.The writing is contrived and stunted. The flow of the story line did not feel natural. The author's idea of description is to begin and end with: Such-and-such ""was soooooooo beautiful.""It begun very well but soon degenerated into a bunch of boring nonsense.Note to the author: CapitalizingEverything and NotPuttingSpacesBetweenThem does not make it SoundImportant or Interesting.BTW E.K.M. Ljung I loved your review. ""(StarMan? StarDrifter? TypingAuthorWomanWithComputer?)"" I laughed very hard."
4,"Satisfying in a traditional, ""comfotable shoes"" kind of way","I was very put off by the odd naming conventions that the Author used in her book, I thought they were giving away too much of the plot. The writing stands alone fine without the need for names like ""Axis"", ""Icarii"", etc... Most readers don't need the author to point out that Axis is, well the Axis of the story. The fact that the Icarii are birdmen, well this wanders dangerously close to a humorous choice of names for me. Naming conventions aside, I thought it was a charming book, but I wasn't really convinced until the second book. Read this book, but only so you can read the next."
2,Not worth the money in hardcover,"I don't think this is thw worst fantasy novel I have ever read. It is in the same vein as the Dragonlance sagas, though not as well written. It is pretty cliche and the character of Faraday is unduly annoying. But I did not throw it at the wall, and I did finish it. That's the nicest thing I can think to say about it.The bottom line is that this book is not worth the money in hardcover. It might have made sense as a pulp paperback, but the fancy packaging does not elevate the writing to what one at least expects from an almost $30 hardcover. I will not be reading any more of the series, but I suggest if you do that you wait for the paperbacks."
1,"I wanted to like it, but . . .","I am new to fantasy, and after losing myself in George R. R. Martin's trilogy (Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings, Storm of Swords) and Robin Hobb's ""Liveship Traders"" series, I was ready for something different. Unfortunately, I next made a very bad choice, ""The Wayfarer Redemption."" If this were surgery rather than writing, I'd say it was done with an axe rather than a scalpel. It is crude and clunky, and the characters are worse than cardboard. I stalled out on it twice because I wanted to give it a fair chance and so waited a while and tried it again: it hadn't improved. The main female character, Faraday, is said to be 18 but acts about 12. And everytime one of the Sentinels called her ""dear one"" or ""lovely lady"" or ""sweet child"" (which is every time they speak to her) I wanted to gag. Final verdict: don't bother. Try Martin or Hobb instead."
2,Oh no! There is a war going on! ...Let's go brush our hair.,"...I will be brief.The plot...was good.But the characters...[were bad].If I want to read a book about manly men stoicly facing uneven odds and damsels in distress, I will read Sleeping Beauty. To be frank, this book [made me mad]. It is perfectly understandable, in the face of realism, to portray a time and place where women are considered unworthy opponents.Fine.That doesn't mean they ARE. Jesus. The main female character, Faraday, who weilds more power than many of the other characters, is like a 10 year old child rather than a supposed 18-year-old. All the women in this book spend most of their time sitting in their room brushing their hair.And the men are even worse.If you can't stomach stereotypes, don't read this book."
4,Beautiful,"I've owned this set of dinner ware for 30 years and needed some new salad plates to replace old or chipped ones. They arrived in great shape and are beautiful. This is an old-fashioned pattern but I still love it. The plates are porcelain. One drawback is that the ""Evesham Gold"" (this pattern) cannot be used in the microwave because of the gold rim; the ""Evesham Green"" can be used in the microwave. We just have a stack of inexpensive microwaveable plates for use in the microwave. After repeated, long-term washings in the dishwasher, these plates have faded; however, as I say, I have had some of them for 30 years. I am still very happy with them! I had found them on another website, but checked Amazon just in case and found that they were much less expensive - and they are perfect."
2,Very different from English manufactured dinnerware,I didn't realize how different this dinnerware is from the dinnerware manufactured in England. They do not match my English manufactured dinnerware very well.
1,These are fakes!,"These are fakes! They are made in Bangladesh instead of England, the design is all wrong, and they are microwave ready. Shame on myTableware!"
4,"""A Wake-Up Call for Humanity"" is a deserving book title","One can sense the vibration of the urgency to prepare for humanity's evolutionary leap - individually and collectively - and a sense of relief that we are headed towards the one-ness in a multi-dimensional universe in the near future: like a light on the distant horizon. I believe, that the detached view with which the material is presented, which allows the reader freedom of acceptance or rejection at all times, makes this such an effective communication tool."
2,Dont read if you are well read on 2012,I would not recommend that you read this book if you have already done your research on 2012.The content I found was a rehashing of the many shapes and forms of the existing content that is already available in a multitude of other books.The context in which it was written was easily readable but lacked a level of creativity.If you are starting out in wanting to learn about the consciousness shift and changes ahead and are not well written then this book will certainly help with that otherwise I would not recommend this book.
4,Heady stuff.,Always read channeled material with the idea that it can be colored by the mediums sub-conscious beliefs. I liked the uplifting message but find it difficult to believe 100% of her message.
4,Well planned for first years,"I liked this casebook. It spends more time in ""textbook"" mode, and less time in ""casebook"" mode than my other first semester casebooks. This was quite useful, in learning, not just torts, but how to get the most of a casebook. It also has more ""learning aids"" than most casebooks, such as sections of outline to use to start your own outlining. The print is larger, and clearer, than in most other casebooks, as well. And the extras built in to this book were helpful in learning how to wade through other, more traditional, casebooks."
1,misleading description by seller,"THe seller advertised the condition of this book as having minimal highlighting wear and tear. The conditon of the book was anything such- the cover was taped together, and it is hard to find a clean page without markings. I am very unsatisfied with the purchase."
5,A refreshing approach,"It's good to hear great rock music again & Frank Stallone delievered the goods to the 10th power. Flourishing harmonies, great hooks, & impeccible musicanship make this CD a home run. ""Winter White"" has the Beatle-esque flavor while ""Twist Shout"" brings memories of a great ""Cheap Trick"" track. This CD has it all, covering a wide range of rock influences and proving you don't need to re-invent the wheel to produce a fantastic rock CD. Run, don't walk to pick this one up if you are a fan of great, timeless rock and roll."
3,Great for a 3 year old!,"My 3 1/2 yr old has watched this over and over. She loves Tom the Piper's son, and Mary (of little lamb fame). She also loves the music. The bad guys are not too scary for a three year old (at least not mine)."
5,This product is amazing!,My husband has been a long time user of the DKNY products so when I found this online for him I was beside myself. This is the only cologne he will wear. It came in on time and was a flawless transaction. Thank you Amazon for helping me make my husbands Christmas!
1,Smell Cheap,"Besides the nice bottle I must say, this mos def is not the cologne for me. It has some what of a cinnamony smell to it which at first makes u think cheap & too strong, but I will say the middle and base notes are much better than the overwhelming top ones, but this is not at all to be confused with thinking this cologne is worth purchasing (in my opinion). But hey colognes are a very person to person thing, and what I may dislike you may absolutely love. So I would def recommend sampling it before taking my word for it...... Once upon a time I was told Marc Jacobs EDT was an awful smelling cologne, but now it just so happens to be my favorite cologne. So take all cologne reviews with a grain of salt, and just go sample them yourself."
1,"Now Sold As ""The Corporate Records Handbook""","The new version of this book is now being sold under a different title: ""The Corporate Records Handbook"". Don't buy this old version."
3,Watch out for the pits,"This pitter looks very much like the pitter that clamps on made by another company. It is faster than doing pitting by hand,but when you are doing one cherry after another it sometimes will punch next to the pit and leave the pit in the cherry.I pitted a total of about 5 gallons of sour cherries this season. About a gallon by hand and the rest with this pitter.About 5 pits per slice slipped by the pitter and we had to be careful eating the cherry pie.Also atleast 2 0r 3 times a pit would get stuck next to the plunger and it would jam.The rubber inserts don't look like they are long lasting.Sour cherry juice is supposed to help with muscle fatigue after exertion, but I'm not going to go out and get gallons of cherries and pit them with this pitter to make juice.I hope there are better pitters out there that don't cost an arm and a leg."
1,great idea - bad product,"It won't let me give no stars, so will give it one, though in my opinion, it is worthless as is. Sounded great and looked like it would work - put cherries in the tray push plunger and the pits drop in little container and pitted cherries pop out into your bowl. Problem was pitted cherries stuck on plunger and unpitted cherries popped out into your bowl - there id a bit of a lip where the cherries are supposed to ""shoot"" out from and the mangled pitted cherries can't make it over the lip, if and when they do come off the pitter/plunger.There was nothing good about the purchase or return of this product."
5,Extremely entertaining,"This was a great read. Not only is it a well-constructed, fast-paced mystery, but Stashower gives us a wonderfully fresh look at the ""Great Houdini"" before he was famous. The vivid details of the time period are exceptional, as are the unforgettable characters of Houdini and his brother Dash. I only hope there will be more Houdini mysteries forthcoming!"
4,"Excellent quality, small design flaw.","The quality of this sink rack is worlds above the other ""stainless steel"" racks that have been available. It is sturdy and the finish stays bright.The only complaint that I have is that the opening could have been slightly larger to allow me to remove my Garbage Disposal Genie. It is kind of a pain to have to lift the rack up when I want to use my disposer.Aside from that, it's a great rack. :)"
1,Bad design,"The center hole is too small. Hard to get to the drain stopper and four holders keeping it level, also too small."
3,U get wat u pay for with this one,Pros fit the sink well had teflon feetcons poor quakity chrome it will rust soon adn the strainer wont fit threw the hole u have to lift the screen to get the sink or disposal strainer out. why have a hole that doesnt fit anything threw it? Id say poorly designed for any 4inch drain probably works for 3 in but who has those.We will probably end up throwing it away and buying another one of better quality
4,Stays better than the more expensive one,"I have two sink grids. One is ""name brand"" from a sink manufacturer, and this one. I like that the rubber feet on this one keep it from moving around in your sink (better than my name-brand one); It is plenty sturdy and the hole makes it easy to access your drain stopper so it's perfect for chicken in the sink or dishwashing. It also works for cleaning as it allows dirt to sink below the grid to keep it off your mop or towel. Protects your sink, looks great, and functions as a drying rack as well."
2,center holes too small to get drain strainer out,I love the way these look but the center holes are too small to get your sink strainer out. You have to lift up the grid to empty the strainer. This doesn't make sense. We have standard-size strainers.
3,"Decent product, nothing special","This does the job. I have it on the right side of my sink and it does what it should, it elevates the dishes off the sink and this is what I bought it to do. It will NOT accomidate the use of a strainer without removing it first but I am ok with that. This is not the most high quality item which is why I removed 2 stars but I'm happy with it. I got what I paid for."
5,"Easy set up, excellent routing","This product was easy to set up on our two computers so they could both enjoy wireless, secure routing. The provided software made the set up very very easy. No problems as of yet"
5,Free of lan cables finially!!,"After considerable research and asking around, I thought this router was the most dependable and easy to setup. I considered the D-Link but had my doubts.I had this setup in 10mins flat with the quick start guide that was provided. For those of you who have SBC/Ameritech's Yahoo DSL and are wondering if this work with PPPoE, it does!! I must admit that was my biggest fear. Now I don't need any of other the Yahoo clunky software on my machines to connect to the net.Is this worth it compared to the 802.11b? That's a questions of your to answer. I felt it was worth the investment to go with more speed between my machine, that might not necessarily be the case for you. The B routers are approximately half the price as I write this and operate at the same frequency, so you really aren't missing too much with them."
3,electronics??,i do not know how this product works since the company i bought it from did not send a power cord and i am still looking for one......who in the world sells electronics with out a power cord????
1,"Not reliable, difficult to setup more than one wireless device",First off I had to call their support to get it to work with my mac and my internet service provider. I was on the phone for over 3 hours (lame). I've had this router for a couple of years now and it constantly needs to be turned off and on to get it to work. I've got a low dollar comtrend wireless router at my work and it's ten times better than the linksys. Booo i hate this thing.
1,Absolute Piece of Trash With Worthless Customer Service!!!,"This product is the worst router we've ever purchased and has caused our family nothing but trouble. The wireless portion only works if there is not security protection used, which is the purpose for which we bought this router! Tech support has been trained to be kind but useless, tellling us to just turn off the security protection - how stupid! NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR WIRELESS USE!!!!!!!"
3,Linksys wireless router,"Practically impossible to setup using the instructions and setup disk that comes with the product. I even talked to someone directly from Linksys and all they did was tell me to download some files and then try to reinstall it again. They did not wait for me to verify that it worked. Well it did not work.I had to get a friend of mine who knows computers to help me configure it. Turns out the router has to be specially set up to work with a DSL modem. Linksys has this information on their website, but it should be part of their standard setup disk.Not at all impressed with their customer support.Once I did get it set up, I am able to connect to the internet wireless with another laptop; which is why I bought it in the first place."
4,Good Choice...,"It's a good Product, after a firmware upgrade everything works fine. it's stable on wireless connections and very easy to configure, I have 3 notebooks and 1 PC working, also good in networked games! Meets my Network needs, Good stuff for a good price. I like!"
5,"Good Range, Sleek Look, WORKS WITH XBOX. WIFE LOVES IT!","I had been waiting for this router for about 3 months, finally had my birthday and dear old mom bought it for me. (bless her heart) Anways, Plugged the bad boy in, hooked up 2 Desktops via ethernet ports, then Desktop upstairs Via Wireless NIC, and laptop is just AWSOME!! I get full 54mbps from router in office(located in basement) to upstairs on other end of house. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!... And as far as the Xbox goes, I'm playing my games right now on it, no wires all wireless with the USB adapter for 802.11G."
4,Real Good Stuff,"Yes,Its really good. But the CD that comes alongwith the Router is no good. I tried several times as they suggested but failed. I then went to Linksys webpage and downloaded an utility for easy setup and in minutes I was browsing the net on my Centrino notebook wirelessly! Its a good Router and the signal is fairly good throughout my home.Good for Indian homes for the beginner in wireless networking as well as advanced user. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Decent home router,What do you expect. It is a $40 dollar router. I use for my home network and haven't had really any problems at all. This review is based on those facts and those facts alone. I don't do any manual configuring besides using EasyLink advisor.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A MAC USER!!!,"I spent the last 4 hours with Linksys support and Mac support and didn't get anywhere. I've connected with many wireless networks and this Linksys router did not connect to my Ibook. The customer service for Linksys SUCKS and they can baraly speak English!!! So if you have a Macintosh, save yourself the time/money/effort that I went through today. The support seemed proficient in Windows but had NO CLUE had to work with Macs. I had to buy Airport Express because of my frustration and I just hope that no one has to go through what I went through."
4,IMPORTANT,"Hello out there! I love linksys software, but for AOL users! Wireless G WRT54G does not support AOL. If you use AOL check with linksys first to see if they have updated drivers, otherwise get the other router (the b router, sorry I cannot remember the model number! its the one that is 89 dollars!Its a drag, Wireless G is faster and has better encrypton!Hopefully they will fix it soon"
3,Difficult to install with SBC 2Wire DSL and Apple Airport Express,"I have a DSL SBC-Yahoo 2Wire internet connection and I had a terrible experience trying to install it myself. I tried everything in the manuals and finally called tech support twice: Once to install my connection and the second time to set up my password access. It took more than 4 hours of my time and 1 hour of tech support to install the equipment.Currently I haven't had any problems using my laptops and PSP, but I have tried (with no luck) to use my Apple Airport Express for more than a month and I haven't figure it out just yet. Be aware that in order to connect your airport express via Linksys you will need to upgrade your firmware, and be ready to spend some serious time working with this project.my personal rating: equipment 8.5, software 7.0, tech support 7.5 (24-7 is nice, but poor english skills), apple friendly 5.0.If you aren't a computer nerd, think twice before installing it yourself."
3,Ruff start,I have liked Linksys since my first networking kit back in 2000 and I thought setting this router with my DSL and other system with a wireless linksys adapter would be a breeze.Installing the router was no problem but getting it setup for my DSL and then adding another computer through wireless was a challenge. The information from the Quick start guide did not match the screens and the tech support tried to be helpful but had no clue. I actually resolve the issues throuh my ISPs FAQ's and downloadable instructions.
3,"Good, but a very strange problem","I bought this router after my Belkin router died. Set up was very easy, however a few internet sites would not load. T-mobile, which is a problem because that is our cellular carrier, and a couple more. About half of the page would load and then nothing. After contacting tech support (not much help on this) I upgraded the firmware. Nope, still the same. This seems to be the issue with Version 5 of this router. Earlier versions seem to be fine according to the research I did. I returned it and bought a D-Link and so far so good. I really liked this router but if I can't go where I want on the net then why own it?"
4,Great router - but trouble with 2.4 Ghz cordless phones,"I've been very happy with this router's performance, and the setup was a breeze. However, every time I get a call, I completely lose my wireless network. I think it's because my phone is only a few feet from the router and it's a 2.4Ghz phone - I assume that's the issue, but it's a bummer. I lose Xbox live and my laptop's connectivity. I'll have to figure out how to compensate or maybe buy new phones that operate at a different frequency range?"
4,Install Wizard Useless ...... But Good Product,"I couldn't get the install wizard to work. However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze. It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important. If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual). If buying for home office or small business this is a must. For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.If you need convincing on the security side, read Wireless Hacks, (this is a book of excellent tips, not just security), published by O'Reilly.Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it."
5,works good,"linksys may be pricier than the rest of the router-makers, but you pay for what you get. i've owned/used d-link and netgear, and i bought the linksys upon a recommendation from a computer nerd. he was right. the router is far more reliable, faster, and has much better reception than the other two brands.the biggest plus was that the d-link router kept on dropping my connection and i'd have to restart outlook and my IM programs. not the case with linksys.one other thing: this router is essentially a small computer running linux, and is completely modifiable in all sorts of ways."
1,Do not buy this or anything from Linksys.,It broke just over a month after I purchased it. I'd rather have a root canal than call their customer service department again. They wanted a deposit of $80 to send me a replacement. In addition I would have to absorb the shipping cost of the broken router I was returning. DO NOT BUY this.
1,Lousy,I use this for a few days and put it on the shelf . It is really very very very slow. Bought a Dynex for five dollars less that is as fast as direct connection.
1,defective,I recieved this and spent 2 hours trying to install it. Finally called a pro who after an hour decided it was defective and it cost me $50 just to try this router out.Very unhappy about that.
1,Garbage,"I lost the wireless connection about 3 times a day with this and had to do constant resets. Very frustrating. I ended up putting it out on the street and getting an Airport Extreme. (Which is outrageously overpriced, but hasn't given me any problems)."
4,Good but may not be what you want,"This is a router it wants to be connected directly to the internet connection if you plan on using this to serve up multiple devices and want to use I.C.S. for N.A.T. buy yourself a ""Linksys WAP54G Wireless 54g Access Point"" it will work out better."
2,"Very poorly designed, often has many problems","This router, while exceedingly popular, is very poorly designed, has a much shorter range than most of its competitors and does do very well at sustaining high speed (or low speed) connections for any period of time. If you want a router that has great range and is easy to set up, buy Netgear, not Linksys."
1,Genuine Soft Leather Black Belt Loop Bag X-Large bad clips,"Genuine Soft Leather Black Belt Loop Bag X-Largeby Allstate LeatherThe clips open and bag falls to the ground.my last hip bag was purchased at bike week FL Iron Horse saloon, I loved it. I even keeped the clips, when it was time for a new bag. I would never use this again on the bike for fear it would fall of on a ride.(the point of having a hip bag is to be used on your ride.)I know now not buy this product online so I can check the clips.I have a patch from my last hip bag waiting to sew on the next one I buy.it reads (Screw house work lets ride) but I need to leave this bag at home."
1,Still Waitining,"I ordered this item the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router last week and at the time the Delivery estimate was July 7, 2008, now that it's July 8th, when I look at the web page, my Delivery estimate has been changed to July 14, 2008. The item was ordered on July 2 and listed in-stock and at the time it said delivery would take 3-5 business days, so even allowing for the 4th of July holiday, it should be delivered no later than July 10th. I know giving a bad review is a little pre-mature at this stage, but I've searched everywhere and there doesn't appear to be any e-mail address to send a comment or a concern to and the only email address I can find just has an auto-reply. So if I can not contact the seller, this is the only other option I can find!! If I do receive the item in the next day or two I'll remove this, but changing the delivery estimate date and not providing an accessable email or contact number is very frustrating!!"
1,Junk,"Poor performance, slow connections, drop out's, and dies 1 day after warrently expires. Get D-Link routers way better quality and performance."
1,Daylight Robbery!!!,"I owned this unit for slightly under a year (October 2007 - July 2008) and it worked pretty well as far as range and strength of the signal are concerned.Wireless died July 2008 and after several calls to different numbers, Cisco customer service asked that I pay an additional $30 for a software upgrade on an item that was supposed to be under warranty.Buyer beware!! This is my only experience with CISCO and my last (if I can help it)."
1,Unreliable,"I owned two of these one replacing the other, both needed to be rebooted every couple of weeks and both of the conked out after less than a year. I now have a D-Link wireless N router that has been problem free for more than 18 month now."
1,Oh my this router stinks!,"I ordered this router because of the high rating it received. I've had nothing but trouble with it. It was a miracle if I could get online first thing in the morning, & even if I could, it was only a matter of minutes before I got kicked offline, & I had to repeatedly plug & unplug (for 30 seconds each time) the router to get maybe another 5-10 minutes of online time.I used their online chat tech support, & downloaded firmware, reset the router, & nothing worked. So they had me send back the router & they sent me a new one.Same problems started immediately. I've had it.I thought Linksys would be a really good router because of Cisco's reputation. I was wrong. I've bought a Belkin N-Router instead & am hoping it works better."
1,Linksys' 802.11b router was unreliable,"To get Linksys' previous 802.11b model (BEFR11S4) to work, I had to buy their WSB24 range extender. My mistake; I should have just returned it to the seller and bought a competitor's product. I put up with irritating interruptions, mostly at night, for 8 months. Also my mistake. But last week the router died. Linksys has offered me a replacement BEFR11S4, which of course is now so obsolete they are giving these things away. To get the replacement I have to jump through a half-dozen silly hoops and wait weeks for delivery. That's their mistake. I bought a D-Link Extreme G and both range and reliability are excellent-- no interrupts. The best advice I can give is to distrust Linksys claims and put no stock in its warranty. I've also had problems with Linksys' laptop card (but not Microsoft's). I've learned my lesson and stay away from Linksys now."
2,Could not get wireless lan to work,"This router worked fine for me--when I used the 4 ethernet ports in the back.But when I tried to connect a second computer through the much ballyhooed wireless feature, it completely failed--and I tried two different Linksys devices, a pci adapter and wireless ethernet bridge. I wound up taking it and all my Linksys equipment back for a refund (read my pci card review for the sad details.)Bottom line: stick to wires for the time being. This wifi technology is extremely moody and unstable, not nearly as solid and reliable as old-fashioned ethernet cables..."
1,Linksys WRT54G not work with AOL.com,I installed my Linksys WRT54G only to find it does not work with AOL.com. I wish Linksys or ... had made this clear in the ads. ...
1,SHAMEFULL!!!,"I would be willing to bet everyone who likes this product has no knowledge of networking or bandwidth. I only get 0.5 to 0.8 Mbits 15' away! The bandwidth rating of 54Mbits is a complete lie. Most of the time the system tray icon will say that you're getting 54Mbits. Howevever, I'm an IT professional so I tested the bandwidth with networking tools which reveal only 0.5Mbits. To make matters worse Lynksys tech support gave me the run arround and then hung up on me!"
1,Not comptible with AOL DSL,"I am so dissapointed to say I have to returen the wireless router and cards I ordered. I spend a whole day trying to hook it up to my dsl. After I tried everything, I turned to the Technicle surport for linksys. I was told the model I ordered(advertised to be very easy to hook up) isn't compible with my Aol dsl. So I have to return them. I called, but fail to remember the address to return it. And I don't know why should I pay the shipping for that? It is not my fault.:("
3,never used it,"I never actually used this or opened it. I returned it, so this review is quite useless. It did however show up on time. If that helps."
1,HARDEST PRODUCT TO SET UP NOT WORTH HASSLE!!,"This was absolutely THE worst product I have ever bought for my computer, I was so frustrated that I brought it back after hours of tech support! Then I asked around, and everyone that had one, also had such a hard time with it. Terrible."
2,Bugs galore,Still not a complete offering from this supplier still very much a work in progress for Linksys by the looks of the firmware revisions.
1,DON'T PURCAHSE THIS PRODUCT.,"Hooked it up, not a problem. However, after a couple of weeks, the signal strength gradually went from 70% down to 20% and then it simply died. No link activities at all, some indicator lights did not flash when they should. I thought it was because of power/phone-line surge that damaged it, so I purchased all kinds of surge protections, and purchased another LinkSys, same model (because it was on sell and had a good rebate), and again, same exact problem after 2 weeks. I returned it and got a brand new replacement, and again, it happened after 1 week this time. By chance, I spoke to a friend of mine about it, and guess what, he had the same exact problem and ended up buying a NETGEAR. I gave up too, and purchased a NETGEAR, and so far after 3 months, no problems and the link quality is still at a constant 97-100%.DON'T PURCAHSE THIS PRODUCT not matter how cheap or how much rebate it comes with. It is not worth your time."
2,"Reset, Reset, Reset","I use to own a Linksys router but I found myself having to reset it more than actual use. I have three computers and a VoIP phone system and it was very unreliable. I also work for a major cable company in customer care and Linksys routers generate a lot of calls for us because customers think it's their internet service and it's not. I replaced mine with a Belkin and haven't had to reset it once in 6 months. I just think you get what you pay for. Yes, another brand may be more expensive but the consistant connection is far more important than price. Not to mention that Linksys customer service department is in another country (good luck getting comprehensive help.)"
1,Do not touch this product,"This product is extremely flakey and unreliable. The helpdesk at Linksys is also inexperienced and somewhat unhelpful due to their lack of English. My quest to resolve the wireless connectivity issues with this product through the Linksys channels has taken so long that it has taken the product out of the warranty period. Linksys has now determined that the issue is a hardware fault which can only be resolved by returning the product. Since the router is ""out of warranty"" they told me that they can no longer help and advised me to buy a new wirless-g router. From them of course!! Be very wary of this product."
3,"Great interface, but lacks speed.","I purchase this item in search for a secure 108 mbs wireless system. I was told by a local retailer that this item would do this; however he was mistaken. I will say that if this unit would have produced the 108 mbs speed that I would have kept it in a heart beat because of all the features that it has, and the simple fact that it is a Linksys."
2,Don't buy this router yet,"...this router only work with linksys 802.11g cardit have problem with other company's 802.11g cardand it have very bad connection with 802.11b clientthe linksys 802.11g card have the same issue with other 802.11g router and 802.11b router.Don't buy this router yet unless you only use linksys 802.11g stuffyou can find out the review at tomshardware.coma recent update for this reviewthe linksys post a new firmwire and it solve the problem with the 802.11b issue. if you have some problem with this router, go to [linksys website]and update the firmwire.it should solve your problem"
2,Compatibility problems,"I got this router to replace my BEFSW11S4.Wired Desktop connected to the WRT54G worked immmediately.Problem: 2 out of my 3 wireless 802.11b adapters were not able to get the wireless link.A skyline Farallon (now Proxim) PCMCIA card: Linksys support recognized there is a compatibility problem with 802.11b device using a CISCO chipset. These devices have to be upgraded somehow (if the different companies don't want to, then too bad....)A WCF11 Linksys CompactFlash wirless card: the Linksys support wasn't able to answer why it is not compatble...and it seems it takes them days to test it (it's 2 of their devices!!!!) and to tell me if it is just one of my devices problem.I have only a Linksys WMP11 PCI card that is still working with the WRT54G.I'm going to wait a little bit to try to test it with some other 802.11b and 802.11g devices and then return it if the incompatibility gets worst."
4,"Great product, as long as you don't need tech support","Nice and fast; strong signal. Even 802.11b cards got a stronger signal with better signal quality, than with the Linksys 802.11b wireless router. Has worked with Linksys, Netgear, US Robotics, SMC and other generic name cards.I tried to bridge two of these to support a remote network. LinkSys tech support kept me on the phone for 75 minutes trying to come up with a solution (they said it was possible, they were just trying to work out how). In the end, they gave up."
1,Don't use included software.,"Make sure you let XP configure thie wireless router. Otherwise the disc that comes with the router will make it practically impossible to use your laptop to connect to any other router, wireless or no. 3 hours with the verizon tech guy today and he finally said the only thing to do is get my computer's drivers fixed.Other than the 5 hours I've spent trying to make up for the mistake of using their software (which they say you must do though you don't have to and shouldn't!) it works. Bastages."
1,Don't Try This at Home,"If you decide to go wireless don't use Linksys. I have spent the last two days of my life on hold to India. The tech support is almost worthless. In consists of unplug or reboot. They are in a hurry to hang up, and not to solve your problem."
4,God value for the money,"Easy to set up behind a DSL modem. Works in both mixed and G-only mode. Has decent security features (You may want to SERIOUSLY consider securing your wireless network at least to some extend, e.g. do not broadcast your SSID, and use the inclusion list to list specifically which computers to allow access. It is simple and easy to do. Read the manual). I am giving it 4 starts because I could not figure out how to set up this router behind another router. The Manual is not very good explaining the process and it plain just didn't work with all kinds of different configurations. The radio is quite decent - I have the router in the basement and I can get signal throughout the house, 3 levels up. And finally one more thing. If you have a Linksys WPC54G network adapter, do not set the router in G-only mode. In my experience the WPC54G simply will not work."
5,WRT54G,I just purchased this router from circuit city last week. It was very easy to hok up. I can use it for my hp 5455 an my presario 2570. Both interfaced by wireless means without any problems. I can be 150 feet away in my house and still get a 54 mbps connection. Very good product 5 stars!
1,DO NOT BUY ! THIS ROUTER IS NOW JUNK!!,"This use to be on of the best routers but since Linksys changed the design v5 , v6 , it is now a piece of junk. Router will not configure PPOE, have to restructure network ip's to get this thing to lip along. Buy the WRT54GL it's the same as the old version 4 (that worked) of this once great product."
3,Been Through 3 of These,"I've had three of these in six years time. They work for about two years and then just get all buggy or die on me. The only good thing is, they've gone down in price. The first one cost me about $100. It's been about two years since I bought the present one, so you guessed it, I'm having to look for a new router."
2,Okay for browsing. not for video streaming,"I was using this for around 2 years for regular browsing, email, chat etc. Recently I started using this to hook up my media player which can play streaming videos from netflix. and it started giving me trouble. The playback frequently stops and slowsdown. The internet connection speed gets slower and slower with videos causing youtube and netflix to not work properly. It takes 5 minutes sometimes to start the video on youtube. None of these issues are there if I connect the computer/player directly to the cable modem. I have tried changing the network cables, switching between wired and wireless connections, etc etc, but none of them helps. As soon as there is this router in the middle the playback is horrible. The only good thing I see with this is good wireless signal strength. If you are using this for just chat and email this is probably an okay router with pretty good signal strength."
1,Awful customer support: Don't buy this product,I've had my router for about 6 months and the product stopped working. I've tried the knowledge base on their site (which is useless) and also tried to contact customer support. The first time I was on hold @ 7am on a Sunday morning for over 30 minutes... I gave up. I then tried to call back and have now been on hold over 45 minutes...and still haven't spoken w/ anyone. Buy a different product and save yourself the frustration.
1,don't waste your money,"Really, don't waste your money on this router. I'm pretty familiar with networking technology and this router has been nothing but a headache, constantly disconnecting in the middle of streaming and then requring a complete reset in order to get back on line again -- 3 to 4 times a day! I corresponded with the company and tried everything they suggested, changing channels, reinstalling the firmware etc., but nothing helped."
5,"Easy setup, flawless operation","This router is the perfect solution to split up your internet connection.The installation is easy if you are a little bit familiar with router configurations, otherwise you might missconfigure a couple of options wich can be changed later on on a trial & error basis. The browser-config is well structured and provides information on what all the options are for.So far the router has been working flawlessly since I bought it, with Linksys wireless card for my laptop and a Toshiba with WiFi as well. I have never been suddently disconnected and although I haven't checked the maximum range of the signal it's still Excellent within 20 meters with wood walls in between."
1,Very bad router,"I am not a computer geek but a normal user who wanted to have a wireless setup at my home. I've used wireless routers before and never had any problem. But this LinkSys router has been a pain since day one. First of all, setting it up takes a bit of time. It's software is very slow. But most importantly, you lose connection after every 30 minutes or so. Then you have to manually unplug the router's power cable and plug it back again to restart it. It works for another half an hour or so, and you repeat the same process!!!I'm not sure why that happens, maybe it's because of RAM or other reasons that people have said on othere reviews.But my sincenre advice, please DON'T buy this router. Don't waste your time.LinkSys should be ashamed of making such a lousy product!!!"
2,Needs to be rebooted once a week.,"I have the WRT 54g v8. Router. Every so often, it drops the connection. It becomes useless until you reboot it. I was surfing yesterday, using my Pocket PC. Everything was fine. I tried a couple of hours later and I got the message Invalid Key. I went to my wired computer and I could not get online. I used the Easylink advisor and it showed that it could not find the SSID or the key or anything. So I had to reboot. This has happened twice so far. I did not spend as much time trouble shooting this time because I had seen it before. It looks like it will stay up for about a week before I have to reboot. I can live with it but I expected better."
3,No RP-TNC connector,"The WRT54G is still a solid wireless router, but Linksys seriously damaged its value by removing the RP-TNC antenna connectors from new units. The WRT54GL still has these connectors, making it easy to replace the standard antennas with stronger units, and increase the range of the router. Get the WRT54GL instead."
3,Ok product...when it works,When this router is working i'm a big fan. Works well with my TIVO and the range is good.Only downside is the router craps out roughly once a week and you have to connect directly to go on the linksys webpage to bring everything back to working order.
2,Do not recommend,"I was informed the Linksys router would be compatible with Mac and PC. However, upon receiving the item, there were no instructions for installing with a Mac. I phoned the help desk. However, the staff I spoke to was not knowledgeable with Mac and I was then directed to contact my computer company to be able to install. After several calls to get the router set up (and several hours on the phone), the router was finally working. However, when I moved approximately 20 feet from the base, the quality of the signal was very poor and did not work. I examined the interference in my residence, but the quality of the signal did not improve. I ended up returning the item. I would not recommend this item as the quality is poor."
1,Terrible - worth 0 stars,"OK for first week or so. Afterwards needed to reboot several times a day as the wired connection to my WAN would lock up. Really frustrated the non-technical family members as they could never figure out why ""email was down again"". Additionally the computers on my network would periodically not recognize each other, corrected by rebooting the router. This was with the latest Linksys firmware update.I went back to my old Motorola BR700 which, to my knowledge, never exhibited instability in the 3 years I owned it.Thanks Amazon for taking it back. It was replaced by a ZyXEL X-550 router - so far so good.Followup 11/24/06: The ZyXEL X-550 continues to be a champ. Hasn't had to be rebooted yet due to connection issues. Unobtrusive, works well."
3,Its OK.. But not that Good,"I bought this router along with WPC54G pc card hoping it will work like a charm, but all its given me are problems since the minute I installed it. Changed 2 WRT54G routers and WPC54G pc cards.. yes 2 routers and 2 pc cards.. am on the 3rd ones now. Same old problems, connection keeps disconnecting again and again. Have the latest firware and drivers installed, but nothing ever worked. For some wierd reason it worked for one week without a single issue, but again its back to the same disconnection issues.Overall I rated it 3 stars coz of its speed which is good..atleast for me as I sit about 12-15 feet from the router and get Excellent signal at 54 Mbps and can transfer large files(when it doesnt keep disconnecting) with amazing speeds. A gig of data can easily be transferred in 10-12 mins max."
4,Difficult but excellent,"This wireless online process was much more compicated than I thought it would be. I followed the instructions to the T but couldn't get this thing to work on the internet. I had to call tech support and wait entirely too long for help. The man who finally ended up helping me didn't speak the best English but he was very nice and worked hard to get the problem fixed. It took about 4 hours to get up and going but now that I have it, I absolutely LOVE it! Excellent signal and speed- I just wish it had been easier to install."
3,Compatibility Issues,"Didn't work for my Mac, easily my fault. Do your research a bit harder before buying for computers. Other than that, great product."
5,Very Good Product,"llego como se esperaba. arrived as spected. This is a very good router and wifi. Funciona muy bien, parece nuevo"
1,Stay away,"I have the newest router version 5. This is a piece of garbage. Do not buy.When I first tried to setup the router, the install software that came with the router crashed on two different computers(one XP and one ME). I had to use the web interface, which worked fine.However, the router crashed about every 8 hours--lights flash, but pinging, web access, everything else is dead. The only fix was to reset the unit.So I upgraded the firmware to the newest v1.00.2.Still crashes every 8 hours. UPnP does not work.Save your money, and your sanity--Stay away."
5,Emjoying new toy,Bought a laptop and decided that I needed a new wireless router also. Have been dreading the day I was going to get one of these routers. Was way to easy to setup thanks to the disk. Everything has connected with no issues. Had a friend help me secure the wireless connection which was not that hard to do.
1,If I wanted a d-link I would have bought one.,"I purchased this product having gone through a few over the years. It has always been a reliable product and I have used it very well. This time; however, it simply did not work. It dropped connections, the admin pages wouldn't come up...it just didn't work. Then I learned why. Linksys, in order to save money, gutted the product, replaced the operating system, cut the memory in half and essentially reverse engineered a d-link. So...naturally, it is now about as reliable as a d-link.Luckily, I learned that they kept the original version in the market for people who do their homework. It's under the model number WRT54GL (L for Linux). I did; however, learn the hard way, so I now have a $50 paperweight to show for linksys/cisco's stupid decision. Now, I have to second-guess all of my purchases of linksys equipment. Why did they have to do that to us and to themselves?"
2,WRT54G...Fast Dying Product,"I've had three revisions of this model the v3, v5, and the v8. All revisions died the same way: after a year to 2 years they stop working. I can no longer access the internet with either routers. If I do manage to get out to the 'Net, they loose their connections fairly quick.I still have my Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless router which still works perfect, except for only being wireless-B. So I have a linksys WAP54G access point hooked in to give me my Wireless-G.I would avoid this router. When my v5 died, I thought it was a fluke, then got a v8. The v8 died the same way, now I beleive it is a manufacturing flaw that Linksys won't fix."
4,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G,I replaced a wired router from Linksys (BEFSR41) with this WRT54G wireless one. Setup was a snap. Performance is no different from the wired unit when the wireless option is disabled as I have not yet purchased the wireless cards and only plan to using the .11G types.
1,WRT54G V5/6 horrible with VoIP,"Although I have recommended the WRT54G to many people over the last couple of years (which ended up being V1-4), I have had a version 5 and version 6 of this router now and neither lasts more than 5-10 minutes when there is VoIP traffic from my Linksys PAP2 going through it. The power light starts blinking and it resets itself. I've current got the WRT54GL on order so I can get back to life without dropped calls (got an old Microsoft MN-500 in place of it now and it also has no issues with same environment/settings)."
1,misrepreentation,"i bought the Linksys Wireless router and even though the product appears to be in good shape, i have no way of confirming this. The wireless router came without a power cord and i was never pre warned about this. I now will have to go to Radioshack and spend another $20 or more to get the power plus plus the amount i already paid for the item, it is better i had gone to radioshack or some other store in the first place"
3,"Good router, but has failed mysteriously","This is the third of these I have bought. It is easy to setup, provides nice control over access based on MAC address and time of day, and works well when it works.However, the two previous units have failed mysteriously.When the first one failed, I assumed it was defective. It would not communicate, and pressing the reset button did not help.When the second one failed, I no longer could assume it was defective, and I assumed it was related to hours upon hours of BitTorrent, because before my son started doing that the first one had run for years.I bought a third one without SpeedBooster, and also have put more restrictions on the amount of continuous traffic, so we'll see how long it lasts.You may ask why I continue to buy these - it's because I have no reason to think the competitors are any better."
3,Caveat for Mac users,"This linksys router comes with absolutely NO instructions or software for macintosh users. You're pretty much on your own for setting it up. Fortunately you can do a google search and find some good info on the web to help, but even then it's not a simple thing. The router seems to work fine once you manage to get it configured correctly, but the set-up can be a *itch for those who don't know much about networking."
4,Perfect,"I get this device recently, it is good enough for my small business needs, one PC and three notebooks, but I did not test its range till now and I did not find it too in any technical details."
1,Nightmare!,"Well, I've bought a WRT54G and a WPC54G notebook adapter to have a nice, fast wireless connection to my desktops connected directly to fast ethernet. However, since the begining, I have problems to keep the connection up and running, I've updated firmware on WRT54G and notebook drivers. But it's getting worse. In certain moment, my notebook stopped to connect at all, so I've contacted Linksys support to get directions. They sent me a new notebook driver package (that seems to be different from one available to download, it's XP certified) and I've been able to reconnect. However, connections don't last more than 4 minutes, even if I'm seeing WRT54G. I'm gonna return it, but I'm really frustrated, after 4 Linksys routers I've bought in the past with 100% satisfaction, this wireless router disappointed me big."
1,Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! Caveat Emptor! WRT54Gv5 is terrible!,"0 stars in this case. I'm emphatically stressing: Avoid, Avoid, Avoid. LinkSys released alpha firmware (v 1.00.6) for this. Looks to be untested. Some of the error screens have grammatical errors. Unpredictable behavior. Port forwarding did not initially work. Idle connections are automatically dropped and there is no idle timeout option in the web configuration. Tech support is clueless - from India and the Phillipines. Product was rushed to market and features do not work as advertised. Also, power supply doesn't output the correct voltage. Cut your losses and get another brand. LinkSys doesn't seem to care about quality."
1,It sucks,"I bought this router because I bought the wireless B Linksys 2 years ago and it worked great. However, this one sucks. I got it from best buy. The first 2 days it worked fine. Then it started getting problems once every 2 days. 3 weeks later, it totally stop working. Since it was within 1 month so I took it back to store for exchange for a new one (I regret I exchange it, I was supposed to return it). The second one is like the first one. The first few days it worked, but I am struggling with the router every day. It would just transfer the data very very slow sometimes and even stop working. I have to restart it regually. Even worse, someitmes I have to restart it several times to get it fixed.It sucks."
2,Product,Bought one three months ago and one day all of a sudden it died on me. The wireless-G router can be on for so long before it stops sending signals or internet. After that you need to unplug and let it cool down for a while. I left mine on all day everyday and found that it has a lot of problems sending signals and communicating with wireless cards (laptop and wireless computer). Customer service for these things are not the greatest either. They seem to have lots of problems with communications themselves (b/t companies and factories). I've been waiting 2.5 weeks for my replacement router (under warranty) and was told I'd have to wait another week. I would buy a different router but I've already paid for one so I'm stuck with it until something new comes up. If you're ganna do light surfing on the net it'll be ok but if you're a heavy net user like me get something else.
4,great product for the price,"This is a fantastic router for those who want to connect more than one computer to the internet. I have connected my laptop and my desktop computers through the router and was able to set it up relatively quickly.Easy set-up. Great tech-support.My only complaint is that on more than one occasion, I would be on the internet on both computers (not uncommon) and all of a sudden my connection would go down. My internet would work fine, but the router would have to be turned off, reconfigured, and both computers restarted. It gets aggravating sometimes.But it has only happened three times in the last month and a half. To me, that is three times too many. Lots of unsaved work down the drain.I do recommend this product, it works, it is easy to setup and configure, and if something goes wrong then tech support is great and they ACTUALLY SPEAK ENGLISH."
3,Router,"Had some difficulties with getting the WRT54G router to communicate with my new Westell 6100 modem. Took several calls to Linksys & Verizon to get it to finally work. The first set up wasn't too bad, but that only lasted 2 weeks. Crossing my fingers that all communications between the equipment stay working. The technical support representatives are kinda hard to understand,as they are located overseas... wish the jobs would come back to the United States!"
1,i've had 2. both were JUNK,"i've had two WRT54Gs and both crapped out on me. The first one worked for a little over a year, and suddenly stopped broadcasting a wireless signal. the second i've had for (literally) 2 months and it pulled the same stunt. tried the normal trouble shooting methods of firmware upgrades and turning off wireless security to no avail. i know it's not my laptop, because it's picking up (and USING!) about a half dozen signals that are near by. i'm outside my return policy, and linksys has a no refund policy -- exchange only.steer clear of this one!"
4,good range but some small issue with AT&T (SBC) DSL,"The wireless range is good, about 150 feet from downstair to upstair in my house. The small issue with AT&T (SBC) DSL service, I have to set the DSL modem as a bridge and let the router do the authentication (that solved the drop connection issue)."
5,"Big House, Big Internet Range","This router, after thorough investigation, was chosen by me to hold a wireless network in a 2 story house. Guess what, it's doing its job superbly. The strength of the signal upstairs in a room, while the router is in a room downstairs, is excellent or very good.I'm really happy with this one, especially after hearing of people with other routers that are not functioning properly.You gotta love this one for the signal - not the alien design."
1,does not work,I could not get it to work and called their 800 number only to be waiting for a representative for 1 hour. I gave up so I have a non-working product. Terrible.
3,Installation challenges with Mac,"Fair warning - if you have a Mac, the installation CD included with the router will not work for you. I spent about a half hour on the phone with their customer service department. They were able to walk me through the install, and it's working fine, but just know it's going to take some time to get things up and running. They are aware of the problem, but don't seem to be making any moves to upgrade the CD include Mac users."
5,good wireless product,We needed a wireless router to work and protect our line. I am very impress with the product and price. I definitely recommend this product.
3,Great unit,"This router works great, I think signal is a little weak. I have two computers downstairs strong signal but signal gets very weak on my son's laptop upstairs, it gets so weak that it flags ""time out connection""."
2,Should be renamed the WReset54G,"I have owned Version 6 this router for several years, it works most of the time. The thing that aggravates me is the fact that I have to reset it once or twice a week. This usually occurs during heavy use ie. several computers doing intensive networking. The router will stop handing out IP addresses, or just stop ""routing"" anything. A reset always cures it. It has an amazing ability to judge just how much downtime I am willing to accept without throwing it against the wall.There are many supposed after market firmwares for this router, but none of them work on Version 6.I have several clients that use this router as well, they have the same problems. I do not recommend the router."
5,A Simple Review From A Non-Techie,"If you're a technical whiz, be warned that you need to skip my review. All others, read on....After purchasing a laptop for my son, I needed to get a wireless router for my home. I put off getting on for fear that things would be ""too difficult.""Finally, I relented and purchased this modem. Even before it arrived, I had planned on having to get my IT brother to do the installation. Turns out, I didn't need him after all!Anyone can install this router! Just follow the directions and it is up and running within minutes. There is nothing hard to understand in any part of this at all. If you know where you're modem cable is and can reach the back of your hard drive, you're ready to install it. As simple as 1-2-3!I've had no down time since having it. And I've found that it works all through the house and even into the yard, so there is definitely great reach on this product.When it comes time to upgrade, Linksys will be the ONLY way for me to go!"
1,It sucks!,"I'm very good at setting things up with computers. I'm the person people come to to set up their PC stuff. I got one of these routers, boy does it suck! I don't know if it was a faulty unit or what, but when plugged up, the computer never could detect it.... not even when hard wired! Not only did it not transmit a wireless signal, it didn't route! I have a friend who's dad set up a linksis system. It works well, however, he is a professional in communications at bellsouth.... it STILL TOOK HIM, A PRO AN ENTIRE WEEK TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONFIGURE IT! Not for begginers or intermediates! Don't go with this company! there are plenty of GOOD ones out there!"
2,Difficult Installation,"I had difficulty from the moment I installed the CD per instructions. I finally got it to work with the online utility. Problem was, it would take up to 30 minutes to get it to connect when I booted up my notepad. I had it set to ""auto connect"" when in range. Once it did connect it worked quite well. This went on a couple of weeks. Finally, I couldn't connect at all.Called customer service, and this is when it got ugly!! I had great difficulty understanding the foreign accent. After 55 minutes, I still hadn't resolved this.Finally, I hung up and bee-lined it to Circuit City for a full refund!!It seems that if you have a PC already configured for a wireless network,and don't need the network adapter, you MAY have better success, but, I wouldn't count on it!"
5,Router works flawlessly,"We live in a fairly large apartment building with many wireless routers in operation. The Linksys setup was fast and very easy. Every area of the apartment is completely in range, and the performance has been flawless. This has proven to be an excellent choice."
4,Works as advertised - if you set it up right in the first place!,"The Linksys G router sets itself up - I used the ethernet ports from the start, and they connected each of my child pcs instantly. When I bought a linksys USB adapter for a distant PC (downstairs about 35 feet away) that machine picked up the signal immediately, even though it was weak (18 mbps). So...I moved the router around a bit, aimed the antennae towards the adapter, added a longer USB cord to bring the adapter a few feet closer and now I'm hitting 54 mbps. Also, I set it up for WPA personal security with a nice, long password to get in. The connection is not really fast, but the PC itself is the real culprit - it's just slow. Since I have a lot of experience on the enterprise level in using networks and sometimes fixing them, I recommend this device. It helps a LOT to know even a little bit about networks."
4,No problems with Router,"But major problems with the bundled Norton Internet Security software. Had it not been for the Norton software completely denying access to the internet, it would have been a quick, problem-free installation of the router, which is working great - very strong signal and great security features. I had to uninstall the Norton software just to gain access to the internet again."
1,WOULD GIVE GIVE NEGATIVE STARS IF I COULD,NEVER BUY LINKSYS ROUTERS!!! WIRELESS CARDS ARE GREAT!!! I WILL NEVER BUY LINKSYS STUFF AGIAN!!! I AM GOING TO D-LINK OR NETGEAR OR SOMEBODY. DROPS INTERNET CONNECTION ALL THE TIME. MUST RESET OR UNPLUG IT REVERY 4 TO 5 HOURS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY I HAVE HAD 2 SAME PROBLEM.
4,Before you start...,"This really is a breeze ONCE YOU FIND THE INSTRUCTIONS. I tried the CD setup and had some difficulty. After a fairly ridiculous conversation with tech support, he recommended that I download a setup program from their website. That was all it took - apparently they didn't have this ready when they released the product, but if you call tech support, the outgoing message tells you where to go to download it. It configures the router for your host machine, then has you download a configuration program for your clients. Voila! Speeed is very good and connection has been reliable."
3,Version 5 of this router isn't as good,"I received a WRT54G v5, which is the latest hardware version of this router. It has half the amount of RAM and flash memory as the previous versions, so it can no longer run the third-party Linux firmwares.This router works well if you just plan to surf the web and maybe play an occassional online game. Configuring BitTorrent to run on this router was a pain though. Any sort of BitTorrent traffic would completely kill internet access, and eventually I couldn't even log into the router anymore."
4,"Good older router, but it works","Finally got this router to work, through a 'nightmare' dealing with Lynksys to get item 'key', etc. which was not included, nor installation instructions. Took several hours of major frustration to save a little bit of money buying this used one. Shipped item fast though. Thanks"
4,"Easy to set up, reliable product","This product was easy to set up with the Installation CD and is easy to use once set up. It occasionally breaks Internet connection, but can be easily re-connected by going to the Wireless Networks window."
1,Worst Router I've ever owned.,I have had the worst experinece of my life when dealing with this router and the company Linksys. The writing on the box said that it handled pass thru VPN. This is important to me becasue I use a laptop from work when telecommuting. I went from a Netgear Router to this Linksys router. Decided to upgrade to wireless when I found out that my old Netgear was not working correctly any more. Once I plugged the Linksys in my problems started. I couldn't get to my outlook any more. I talked to the Tech's with no success and could hardly understand them when they talked over the phone. I got an RMA number to send the Linksys Router back for replacement. When I received the replacement it was used and when I plugged it in it didn't work. I was so frustrated I threw in the garbage and went down and bought the new D-Link router. Thank you D-Link. Everything is great again. I will never buy another Linksys product again.
2,It's nice but...,"With third party firmware, it can do lots of stuff only a router that costs much more can do. However the hardware is cheap and will crap out on you fairly quickly. I can't recommend this product unless you can get them cheaply enough that throwing them away on a regular basis isn't an issue."
4,Great Product.,"Second one of these routers I have purchased. Can certainly attest to its performance and reliability. I know it will work out great once I actually receive the item!! Decided to go with FREE SUPER SAVER SHIPPING. What a mistake. Should have just paid for shipping instead. Tracking shows the item has been sitting at USPS since 10/15/2007. Delivery estimate was October 23, 2007 - October 29, 2007. Next time I'll just pay you guys for shipping and not get baited by his crap again. That way I won't have to watch my package sitting in the Post Office 20 mins away for 12 BUSINESS DAYS and still not being delivered!!! If its money you want I'll pay for reliable shipping but don't screw me over with so called ""FREE"" shipping deals. Already lost what it would have cost in paying shipping because of this delay anyway. Keep up the good work guys!!!</END RANT>"
2,WRT54GS,"Junk! Matching speedbooster wireless card connects to the internet only when it feels like it, even in the same room as the router and with 100% signal strength. Tech support says to download new firmware - can't find firmware for v5 on their site.Have spent way too many hours with this piece of crap!"
1,Too bad zero stars is not a choice,"I decided to try a different brand after having 2 different d-link routers fail on me within a year. I picked up the WRT54G and within hours of install I had to reset it. No big deal, I thought maybe is was something I did. That turned out not to be the case. Days 2 and 3 required at least 2 resets each day. The wireless is the problem. After a while my laptop and my sons desktop (wireless) would drop, but my wired desktop was fine. I took the router back and bought the Belkin F5D7231-4. The setup was great and so far my connection has been solid."
1,What happened?,"Setup was OK but despite claims that it works with existing 802.11b networks it doesn't, I get less range now than I did with just the 802.11b network - be careful."
4,wrt54g linksys router,great router for use in home-based and small business ienvironment. Have used the item since it first came available and have found it to be reliable as well as safe from extental intrusion. An inexpensitive way to protect systems benind the router's firewall.
2,"Works as is, but not with Sveasoft","In spite of reliability problems with previous Linksys routers, I bought this one because the WRT54G was supported by Sveasoft. Now it turns out that I was shipped the V5 version of this router which has been modified to NOT run this popular, powerful, inexpensive firmware. This was NOT mentioned in the product listing.I can't imagine what motive Linksys had for this, since they don't get revenue from their own firmware. It just seems like a downgrade for no reason.Two stars rather than 1, because it did work right out of the box without problems."
1,problems until i returned it,"just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of people having problems with this router. from the start i was not able get it to connect one of my two laptops, even though that laptop connects fine to other wireless networks. the second laptop (iBook) was OK at first but then twice the linksys router dropped the connection and stopped serving a wireless connection. it was like it disappeared, as far as the wireless iBook could tell. the router still connected computers to the internet by a cabled connection, but not wireless. no amount of resetting or calling tech support fixed this. they eventually said i should return it to them but i don't want such an unreliable router. i'll return it, but i'm buying a router from a different manufacturer."
1,Secure Easy Setup? Far from it...,"I have set up 3 different wireless networks for my apartments over the past 3+ years. In my current apartment, I had a Netgear 802.11g network working flawlessly complete with Lingo VoIP service , networked printer, and up to 4 laptops connected. However, the company my girlfriend works for, Diageo, for some bizarre reason only supports Linksys equipment for employees working remotely. Therefore, I bought this router. Promises of Secure Easy Setup were anything but that. The setup wizard on the installation CD crashed on 2 of my laptops during the configuration process. In repeated attempts to run the wizard, it crashes upon clicking anything on the initial startup page so I cannot even get the process going. I am not going to bother with what is for sure to be a lengthy technical support call and I am going back to my trust Netgear router."
1,Constantly loses signal- Poor product,This router is fast but what good is that if it loses its signal every five minutes. The problem has gotten worse - I have installed the latest firmware for this router - still loses its signal every five to ten minutes. I have checked other sites and the problem is prevalent with this model. Don't buy it. One of my computers is literally four feet away from the router and loses its signal all the time. We have two laptops - same issue. Poor product - Linksys technical support is in denial on this issue. It is almost like the silent recalls on autos - they probably feel it is not worth it to resolve this issueHooking the computer directly to the Comcast cable modem by ethernet resolves all lost signal problems - so I know it is the Linksys router.
4,Bad start but working now,"I just had a hard time configuring this router to work and unlike the previous reviwer who thinks it maybe the PCs which are not connecting to the router, I tend to agree with the one who thinks those who gets connected are just lucky :)I have 2 PCs and brand new laptop and non of them would go online with this router. I am replacing D-Link rounter which worked fine but would drop connections occationally.After almost two hours with customer support, I got mine working. The support people were good, helpful and polite but initial wait delays long. I am assuming the router should fly smooth from here now. If I face problems, I will update this review."
5,Can't get any easier than this,"I have installed this product before for other people and found it to be fairly easy to do. Well, it got even easier. REALLY plug'n'play type. I just basically reviewed the settings to confirm and did not have to do any major adjustments. Cisco has improved a product that was good to begin with."
3,Review Cisco-Linsys WRT54G,"The shipping time was good.When I open the package the case of the router was open. No big deal, I could put the pieces together.The router works so far. I have to disconnect for 10 seconds every other day because the router stops working, this is very anoying.I supose it is a second had product so I shuold not complain."
2,Not reliable,"I had two of these fail in the exact same way. The lights would appear normal, but the router would simply stop routing. Local traffic was OK, but no internet. I'm now using a Belkin which works great (and was half the price of this router). No more Linksys for me."
1,Version 5 is horrible,"Beware of the version 5 of this router, they have taken a great product and turned it into garbage by dumbing it down hardware wise and switching the OS. This product was release very premature and has many issues. They just now finally released a firmware that allowed more than 256k to flow through the router, the changelog for the firmware update states ""Resolves issues with slow downstream speeds"". It seems that Linksys no longer cares about their reputation and only cares about producing their product for as cheap as possible and screwing their customers.Very bad move by Linksys."
2,Not worth all the trouble,"I, like so many others bought this router before I became aware of all the problems with version 5. I spent over 3 hours during a period of two days on the phone with tech support (in the Philippines) going through all sorts of completely useless changes to the configuration. I even received such ridiculous suggestions as ""Just take it back and exchange it, not all of them are bad."" Ooh, that was helpful. Finally, in a rage, I insisted on speaking to a tech in Irvine, CA where the company is based. In less than 15 minutes the very knowledgeable tech immediately recognized my problem even admitting that it shouldn't have taken so long for them to route my call to him. He emailed me a file containing a firmware upgrade (version 1.00.3 that has yet to be released to the public) helped me through the upgrade and the router has been working fine since. That's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of 1 since it actually works now. Probably better just to steer clear."
1,v5 is buggy...,"lightning killed my old v2, which worked flawlessly. I replaced it last week with the new v5. Works fine, as long as you don't mind resetting it on a daily basis. For whatever reason it just hangs every 8 or 10 hours or so. Upgrading firmware to 1.00.2 does not fix things.v5 also has half the memory of previous versions. In short, my experience with the WRT54G v5 has been negative."
4,So far so good,"I've had this for a little over a week and it's working well so far, but I'm currently only running a PC and wireless printer. Set up took well over an hour but tech support was very helpful. It turns out I needed to download firmware."
1,"Horribly flawed, with no support","This router simply does not work. Whether you're directly connected to it via Ethernet or using the wireless connectivity, the connection goes dead every half hour. It's like clockwork, and the only way to get the connection back is to unplug it for 15-20 seconds and plug it in again, only to have to go through the same process a half hour later when your connection dies again. Linksys appears to be doing nothing about this problem, and the only solution that's been found anywhere is to put a network switch between your computer and the router, but that still doesn't help the connection drop on the wireless which, needless to say, is a serious problem for a wireless router.Stay away from this product."
3,"Difficult to setup, missing some basic features..","I own a mac, and the router had labels all over it to run the installation CD before using it. The CD does not work for a mac. It took me a while to figure out how to configure it with a mac (which was actually pretty straightforward).The router also dosent have a very important feature that i needed, which is Reserving IP Address according to the mac addresses. This is important if you run servers behind the router.The interface is also not so user-friendly. For example, from the list of currently connected computers, we cannot select them to add to the authorized list.These are some of the things that are present in any cheap router available in the market. Basically was quite upset with the router."
1,no end of problems with this router,"I am having nothing but problems with this router and notebook adaptor card. Spent 2 hrs 20 mins on the phone w/their support group cause the notebook cannot access the internet when using the wireless adaptor. At one point the help line got both thelaptop and dektop working but as soon as I moved the laptop13' away from the router not only did my laptop access to the internet stop but my dsl stopped working as well. When I called my ISP and went thru several exercises, we determined it was the router but no one at linksys can get it up and working! Nor can they explain what the problem is"
1,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this product. Have been having problems from early on, virtually since buying it. Their customer support tends to blame everything else (the operation system, the internet provider, existing firewalls, etc) and just created additional problems with unhelpful recommendations. ultimately, 5 months after expiration of the 1 year warranty, after acknowledging that yes, the router ""went bad"" (these were their exact words) they just advised me that they could not replace it. so, basically this is a somewhat problematic router for those of you who don't need it for more than a year. as for me, I'm switching to Netgear. Today."
1,WRT54G Unknown bad luck,1st WRT54G received from Amazon was openned and appeared to be a returned item so after Amazon replaced it is where my problem arised. I was able to talk to the wrt54g for about 3 minutes before it died. I configured it with a wired connection which was real easy then tested my wireless laptop. Then the wired computers could not reach internet but the laptop could. So I unplugged the linksys and plugged it in..... Poof. End of WRT54G. Called Tech support(India by the way) after 45 minutes of try this and that they confirmed it was dead. By dead I mean you could not even ping it. Amazon elected not to replace it and refunded my purchase as they said the WRT54G was too problematic. Others I know have it and love it. Will try again later
3,I own 4,"I own 4 of these bad boys. Router #1 decided to start messing up, so I called up tech support and got walked through destroying my config (I had 38 mac addresses in there). Completely irreproducable problems for the second half of its life. Turns out it evidently is a transmitter problem as the range is down to 30 feet now.Router #2 is much better, it's a different model, different plug, I think Cisco had bought them at that point. No problems so far.Router #3 (home) likes to get funky when I go bittorrenting on it. I will watch as my maximum number of open connections goes from 500 or so to 100, resetting the cablemodem has no effect, resetting the computer has little effect, resetting the router fixes it right up.Router #4 (located at some apartments I own) seems stable, does not appear to have any issues.I am overall, annoyed with the tech support, have read numerous complaints about Linksys choking on bittorrent. It's stable for the average user, but not the power user."
4,Linksys Wireless 54g Got have it!,"I recently purchased this and it is my first experience with a Linksys product. I found that the installation was simple and straight forward. My WirelessG card work instantly with no problems. However I had a Compaq 11Mb card that I couldn't get connected and after digging around in the access point, making sure it was set to handle both 11.b and 11.g. I found in the advanced settings that the speed is set to 54mb by default. I set this to auto and my 11mb card connected with no problems. Somthing to look out for but not hard to find or change.I found the speed and range to be very good. I could go anywhere around my home. A nice touch is the built in Dynamic DNS feature for those you want to host thier own web site.It has plenty of features and simple enough for the novice and some nice advance features for the Power User or complete Geek."
5,Router upgrade,I was pleasantly surpise how easy this unit installed after reading all the negative reviews about it. I replaced an old Dlink router with this one and the upgrade took about 20 minutes. The only issue I had was on how to setup static IP address behind the router for systems I have that do not use dynamic address assignment.
3,ROuter,"Generally the product performs as advertised. It replaces an older D-Link product to cure the problem with other wireless network interference and an occasisonal freeze up. The occurance of the freezes has gone down but still persists. Part of the problem may be due to a commercial wireless network in the neighborhood or other manufacturer's units in the area (there are six competing wireless networks active at any time). Frequent unplus/replugs are required.User set up is too complicated. This is a second unit I purchased. The CD that comes with the unit is not very useful in the config process. Too much techno-talk throughout for an average user and no explaination that a layman can understand. There should be an easier way to deal with the set-up/config process. Can we put marketers, not engineers in charge of this process?"
4,So far so good...,"Setting up this router with my Windows XP desktop and Wii console was very easy using the setup CD and instructions enclosed. In less than 20 minutes I was connected by cable to the desktop and by wireless to the Wii.By the next morning, however, my system no longer acknowledged that a network existed and I no longer had any type of connection through the router.Scanning through some of the earliest comments posted here I decided to try the following solution: Using the Network icon in Control Panel for Windows XP, I UNchecked the option to ""Enable IEEE 802.1.x authentication for this network.""The router has worked without a hitch since then."
4,Good router at a good value...,"I have this router in my basement and can access the network from anywhere in my 2 story house. Occasionally the router will hang, although that may be because of our Cable modem issues - however it is simple to unplug it and wait 30 seconds before plugging back in. Web interface is not as user friendly as I have seen, but is powerful enough for any home users to set up their own wireless networks. I wish they had a built in print server but that is minor considering it would have added at least $20 to the price, and can be purchased seperately. Probably still the best home 802.11g router available for performance, reliability and price."
3,I believe I got a bad unit...,I used this router for 1 month or two and had to return it back because it was freezing every time. had a good speed but I couldnt work restarting the computer and router.
3,Why must technology change?,"The only reason I bought this router is because I had to in order to have internet access throughout my home with Earthlink. I had the ""B"" router and, because of technology changes, was forced to buy this one. Maybe I'm naive about how things work (which I find hard to believe), but why must everything be disposable and outdated the minute it hits the market? Does it work? Yes. Is it easy to setup up? Somewhat (unless you have no computer experience). Does LinkSys have great customer servicer? Yes (probably the best I've seen). Should you buy this? If you need a wireless router, it is the preferred brand."
4,"Router fine, Power supply = helicopter","Ive had this router for a few days now, it works fine, very easy to install and configure the network for the house. We have 1 laptop and 2 desktops, all run fine.Main problem soo far is the power supply is noiser than a damn helicopter!! I had to get in the night at unplug the power supply! The router is quite, its just the power supply!! The noise gradually picks up, to start off it pretty quite, but it gets to a point where its just unbearable!"
4,works for me,"Had no problems with this router, been in uses for 4 months now. Excellent in all respects. My personal experience, would buy again."
3,"It's OK... some pros and cons,","I bought the Linkys router for my family. The setup was fairly easy, but then around 2 months later, I started having problems with the network and always had to reset the whole entire thing, which was a long process. I guess maybe I did something wrong, but it got quite annoying. But now it's working fine. I would probably reccomed it."
1,"If you need tech support, you'll be sorry with Linksys!","I could not get this router to connect to a PC with an 80211.G LAN card no more than 3 feet away. I have also have an 80122.B laptop that would not work with the router right on top. Cisco really dumped quality when they bought Linksys to enter the consumer market. [ASIN:B00007KDVI Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router]]I spoke with three tech support personel, only the last of which I could understand and was even hung up on by the second! After 3 hours of futility, I logged onto Amazon and immediately got an RMA. Thank you Amazon."
4,Simple setup and a good product.,The setup was relatively simple. It took me about twenty minutes. The range was decent but I recommend buying the larger set of antennae. Once I put that on I can stay connected almost a block away. It's been on continuously for about six months and no problems to report. Solid product and Amazon had it way cheaper than the other places I looked.
3,"Certainly not ""Plug-""n-Play""","Worked fine out of the box when being used as a wired router but it took a total of 4 hours on the phone with tech support, several firmware downloads/installations and more asprins than I care to admit to get this puppy working wirelessly. I'm no techie but I'm not a dummy either - this product needs lots more tweaking and better documentation+support before it's ready for prime time/ mass appeal.Even after finally getting it all up and running we have experienced numerous, ""drop-outs"" of wireless communication with the router lasting from a few minutes to almost an hour. None of the re-set procedures have any effect. So far it has always come back on its own, eventually. Who knows about next time???In use primarily as a router for satellite internet service routed to two wi-fi ready laptops running WinXP."
4,Wireless Home Network,"The product itself is great. Instructions for how to connect it to cable modem could be a bit more explicit regarding the need to determine and configure the MAC ID, but once connected, it works flawlessly. A solid, dependable product at a good price."
4,"Copper I Got Ya!,","This inexpensive radar unit for autos works to track signals from police magnets, thereby informing you of the presence of police in the area and it is especially at high alert around donut shops and restrooms. The theory behind this is that you won't get a ticket if you know a copper is in the area, hence people will slow down and put away their crack pipes. It can also pick up strange alien frequencies, Pavarotti concerts, AM/FM radio signals and certain Republican conventions, which are a complete bore."
3,So-so,"I bought this router as a replacement for a Netgear that died after 18 months or so. In reading the reviews, it sounded like the Netgear routers had heating issues and eventually would crap out. The Linksys was highly rated so I got it. I should have just gotten another Netgear. My old router was rock steady until about a month or two before it died. Then it needed frequent rebooting. This thing has to be restarted at least once a week. My old one probably got reset twice in the entire first year. I'm only a few months into the Linksys router but I'm not impressed. Range is good and speed is good too but this constant need to reboot is annoying, especially since I didn't have to reset my previous router. I'll keep this one and buy another brand when it dies."
4,As good as posted,"Very nice one, As too many in america I stardet buying a very inexpensive chinese Router, in fact, i changed it 3 times, finally I decided to get a REAL one and got this one... Nice price, Reliable, and easy to use."
5,Works Great on Mac!,"Although Linksys doesn't seem to have any official Apple support for this product, I find it works just fine with Apple's AirPort Extreme. I got a new PowerBook 12"" and installed the Extreme card, but only had the old (Graphite) 802.11b base. The price on this unit was just so much less than the Apple equivalent that I had to give it a try. If you don't mind using a web browser to configure the unit, you'll do just fine."
4,LINKSYS does it again,"This is an excellent product that doesn't take a lot to set up or configure. It comes with lots of options including the ability to limit internet access during certain times of the day or night, which could be used to limit your child's internet access while you are away from home.The only problem I encountered was the quick installation setup program that came on CD would not work with on my XP operating system. Tech support via email was helpful and timely. I encountered no wait for tech support via telephone and the techs were very polite. However, they still couldn't figure out why the setup program won't run on my computer. But did walk me through a couple of configuration issues I had.Overall, an excellent product I would recomend again and again."
2,Not Mac Friendly,"This wireless router is not for a mac and was very difficult to set up on the Linksys website for security. It kept kicking me out. Additionally, it is NOT mac friendly and they do not offer any Mac tech support. The CD that comes with it to set it up is PC only. I am pretty computer savvy and I had so much trouble that we have returned it!"
1,It works great!! For a while.....,"I've had three of these Linksys WRT54G Wireless Routers. Why three? Well, with each one, they work absolutely fantastic...for about 2 months and then seem to become, for a lack of better word, ""stymied"". It's almost as thought they can only process data for awhile then stop. Obviously I'm not a computer expert, but I've contacted Linksys technical support several dozen times (not kidding - I've written them all down). So, they have sent me two replacment routers. I know the router is the problem because if I connect my computer directly to my cable modem, it works fine. With the Linksys router, it just stops connecting from time to time randomly. I have a Linksys WIRED router from the past, and it works just fine - and always, so I thought the wireless one would work well, but this is not the case. If you are considering purchasing this router, I highly, highly suggest you consider a Belkin instead."
1,Linksys's newest shot at proprietary dominance,"Although I'm sure this is a decent model of router, please note that this model (despite discrepancies in the picture) is the latest revision. Linksys has done the wireless community a great disservice by making it incompatible with third-party firmware that has more functionality than Linksys's own proprietary firmware. For a better, more compatible model, Linksys is now making us shell extra money for itsLinksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router (Compatible with Linux). The extra price is worth it, though, since the third-party firmware lets you increase the gain on the antennas and turn your routers into gateways, among other nifty features. All-in-all, the WRT54G is a good starter model for those who don't want to mod, but the extra $15 for the WRT54GL would be worth it for anyone who plans on a true firmware upgrade."
3,Bring Your Patience or CALL Tech Support FIRST,I design web sites for a living and thought I knew a little bit about computers but the Linksys Wireless-G Router is not easy to get set up. I started over again several times trying to get it installed and decided it was not EVER going to work so I packed it up to take it back.The next day I decided to take a deep breath and break down and give tech support a call. I didn't do it the first day because who wants to waste loads of time listening to elevator music or advertising for the company to speak to a technical person.Actually I didn't have to hold for very long and the technical person I spoke with made me wish I had called them earlier.So my BEST advise is to CALL technical support and while you are on HOLD OPEN the box and do NOTHING until a tech support person instructs you to do something. This will keep you from wanting to send your computer through the window. CALL FIRST - then OPEN the BOX - save your sanity.
1,Testament to the worst in wireless technology,"This product offends me. The instability of this model is shocking. CIsco let this thing out into the market? Multiple random signal drops are a daily occurrence. The support people at Linksys (Cisco, whatever) barrage the user with already easily accessible information, and then decide it might be alright to do a same model replacement. Bottom line, the model is horrific. Speedy when working, but, like Nomar Garciaparra, what good is a brilliant player if said player only functions half the time? I have done in depth troubleshooting and narrowed the issue to the router itself. The firmware just freaks out from time to time. NEVER have I had a wireless router perform SO poorly.Recommendation: skip this garbage item and go for the Linux based version (WRT54GL) which is a pretty damned good bit of equipment. If you'll excuse me, I need to go follow my own advice.Cisco, you oughta be ashamed."
1,"Never Again, I Think","Instructions that came with the router did not result in installation and calls to Linksys customer service suggesting downloads also did not get it working. Additionally, it screwed up my cable modem connection which necessitated a replacement modem from my cable service. Ergo, this router sits on a shelf as I am too apprehensive about what may happen if try to install it again. Meanwhile, I'm doing very well with my new modem and my direct cable connection. I should mention that that similar Linksys unit that I shared for months gave no problem. This new unit did."
1,Drops Connections Constantly,"Purchased as a replacement for a Linksys 802.11b wireless router which suddenly died after 1.5 years of use. We have two Macs and two PCs sharing this wireless router. It will work fine for a few days, then for no particular reason the data rate will slow to a crawl, then the connection is dropped completely. Sometimes all the computers lose connection, sometimes only some of them do. These computers are generally sitting in one place and not moving around much at all, mind you. Sometimes cutting router power fixes it, sometimes resetting firmware does, but sometimes nothing works and we just give up until it comes back by itself. We are now unable to rely on our internet connectivity at all, something we rarely had to worry about before. We're very unhappy with this product."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK !!!,"I have been a huge Linksys fan in the past. But I have had 14 months of intermittent problems from Hell. Many hours of phone calls to Linksys says all is fine and Comcast says it is the wireless router. I figured it was my very old owned modem and bought a new one for $80 bucks. Same problem!!! Disconnected WRT54G and dusted off an old wireless B router and all was great. With all the phone calls to Linksys, they wont exchange it (under warranty) until I reconnect it and go through troubleshooting it on the phone yet another time with them. I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with 2 people, on hold once for 10 minutes because the guy was telling me it was a 1 year warranty and I was saying it was 3 years. OH, NOW he tells me this v5 and the v6 have known issues, never mentioned before. Just forget it. My time is worth more than this garbage."
3,I Expect Better From a Cisco Product,"The WRT54G is a good product for everyday home use. If your home is large or has thick walls, I wouldn't expect the signal to travel through every part of it, however. My first complaint is that the router comes with the signal strength at a default of 50%. I had to hack it to boost the strength to 100%, since there is no option to do so in the default firmware. Secondly, the software that comes with it does more harm then not. It loads a bunch of proprietary programs that frequently conflict with the Windows software already on the machine. I suggest throwing out the CD as soon as you get the device.These two things aside, though, it is a nice product for the casual user. If you are serious about your wireless network, though, I suggest going with a more powerful router, like the Cisco 1202."
2,"Fine if it works, bad customer service","The one I bought worked fine at first. Technical support was good but once they determined the unit was defective, their customer service was extremely bad. Tech support can't transfer you to customer support and you need customer support to get a replacement unit. Customer support doesn't answer their phones (I was on hold for 45 minutes). They only sometimes answer email. Due to this experience, I will never buy a Linksys product again. They don't offer enough to overcome the bad customer support experience."
1,A Real Pain in the LAN,"The one I got came from EArthlink, so had no real instalation directions. Signal strength is so lousy that I have a better signal from my neighbors accross the street. I have to constantly force my other computer to retrack the network. On-line help takes forever and has all the usual problems with trying to deal with someone in India who is working from a script and has never used the product.As soon as I can pull the CAT-6 I am going to hardwire my system.This wireless stuff is garbage. My best signal at about 25 feet only gives me about 11 MBS."
3,customer service,Don't call Linksys customer service unless you're interested in the weather in India. Don't run the installation disc if you have windows XP. Let the windows software do the work. Call your ISP before you set it up or plug anything in. Otherwise works well.
4,Decent,"Good performance, but it has reset by itself like twice and the area of coverage is not as large as it advertises. For the price its decent."
5,Good router,"Had the same router with B technology and worked well with another computer with the B card. Both had Windows XP. Upgraded receiving computer to a Vista system. Could no longer connect. Bought G router and G card and connected after jumping through only a few hoops, as expected. Found out later that I didn't need G router -- the B technology router works with G card."
2,WRT54G Rev1.1 a Step Down,I purchased a WRT54G (v1.1) with modest expectations on installation. I'm no novice to PC installations. Unfortunately I ran into problems. After working on the installation for ~1 hr. I contacted Linksys. After ~30 min. of (good) support I was asked for the version number. It turns out that the latest model version (v 1.1) doesn't work with my DSL modem - Westell Wirespeed. Linksys has been aware of the problem.<< This revision is a step back..>>I was assured by Linksys that the earlier WRT54G version would work. I hope to get the chance.PLEASE Note: Before purchasing this product .. contact Linksys.
3,Throw away the installation CD it comes with,I had nothing but trouble with the installation CD provided with the router. Accessing the setup wizard through the Linksys website made configuration and set up a breeze.
1,another total failure of VxWorks,"it's extremely unrecommended to order these units (wrt54g version 5), very bad firmware quality inside, no options to upgrade firmware (don't expect any new version soon), no chances to get bugs fixed.device is very limited in memory, so no new features or functionality in the future planned.frequently signal loses, bad compatibility with new MacBooks, frequent failure on routing requests and bugs in user interface (well known port forwarding bug still not fixed).it's another great failure of well known proprietary solution called VxWorksstay on open software, where lot's of enthusiasts reverifying ugly pices of code written by ""very busy"" people.order wrt54gl instead ('L' means, it's running on linux, and could be easily upgraded to more stable open firmware in replacement of original default junk stored inside)."
1,Warning to AT&T high-speed internet customers,"I'm sure under the right circumstances this is a great product. In fact, I use a Linksys wireless router at home with a Linksys cable modem and have never had any problems.HOWEVER: If you use AT&T; DSL, this product ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY DOES NOT WORK with a Siemens SpeedStream 4100 DSL modem. AT&T; does not give you the option of using any modem but the one they send you so do yourself a favor and try a web search using the name of your modem and the name of the router you are thinking of purchasing to find any compatibility issues."
4,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router,"Good price for the router, easy to set up, works well. Only drawback is that when it needs to be rebooted, the only way I can figure out to do that is to run through part of the setup wizard again."
3,not for a PS3,purchased to use with our PS3 and found many times had to reconnect. We are now looking for something that is more compatible with our computer and the PS3
3,A difficult problem with this router...,"I have had many years of experience in home/corporate networking. I have found that this particular router had some unresolvable issues. I updated the router with the latest firmware. According to linksys there are no hardware issues with my router.For my current setup I have one Macbook and 3 Desktop PC's. I use my main router on one of my desktop PC's. The problem occurs when I use my Macbook to connect to the internet. Once connected, the router stops all internet activity. This happens every single time, the only way to resolve the issue is to manually reset the router every time. The airport card in the Macbook is compatible with this router according to the requirements. I've contacted apple and linksys for support and both attempts have been unsuccessful in trying to resolve this issue.Please advise."
1,Freezes at regular intervels,"The new installation from cd is Excellent. very user friendly and any one with out knowledge about router can install one. This great installation wouldn't help if the router it self does not work. It worked good for around 10 hours and there began trouble. At regular intervals the router is freezing . So I updated the firmware ( My ver. is 8.0.0.. and updated to 8.0.2...). There was no use, the problem continued so, I ordered replacement which I got in no time. The hell with the new one is very serious. It didn't even last five hours. I have to restart the router and again after 5-10 hours it freezes again."
4,Easy entry into wireless,"Having bought other Linksys products I was inclined to try them in setting up my wireless network. I had no problems with Windows 2000 or even Windows 98. Setup went quickly, a few reboots and boom, I was wireless.The only quirk is that coverage seems to be spotty. I have a one bedroom Manhattan apartment (as in small) and in the next room I get only a 30% signal. Well, maybe our walls are real thick.Quality is good and overall I am very satisfied."
3,Linksys WRT54G works great!,I originally had a continuous problem with disconnects. I found that the problem was using DHCP with this router. Once I turned off DHCP (using a static IP now) the router is rock solid. I'm hopeful (and expecting) that Linksys will release new firmware correcting this problem.Good luck!
1,Junk,I loved linksys. Now I hate it. Nothing but problems. I keep getting disconnects and speed problems and my PC's are located less than 10' away from the router. I have a hardwired xbox hooked in and I even have problems keeping it connected with this router. Time to move on.
4,very happy so far!,"I purchased the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router and the Wireless-G PCI Adapter WMP54-G. I've got a laptop with a built in Wireless card already and I wanted to network the laptop with my desktop. This was my first time setting up a network like this and it went rather smoothly. I used the CDROM for the install, then after that went in the web based interface to fine tune it. The desktop worked immediately I was very happy with that one. The laptop took a little playing around with the drivers for the built in card. Once I got the drivers right it hooked right up to the network. The range/signal seems very good with this router. I'm in a house approx. 2500 sq. ft. and get good coverage throughout. I have not seen any interference with my cordless 2.4 ghz phones either. All in all great product for the price, hard to beat."
5,Linksys WRT54G,No problems with set up or accessing the internet through the router. I replaced a USRobotics with this router because my son-in-law had an XBOX 360 and it was not compatible. So far we have not encountered any problems.
4,Good but not enough troubleshooting options.,The router has a good network range. and the signal strength is strong. I have had no problems whatsoever using it till now. Except a minor glitch that it failed to install properly and i was not able to set-up a secure wi-fi network.
1,the WORST expereance I have had with support & hardware,"I bought this router to connect my brand new hp 9000 laptop to my existing cable modem.After over 3 hrs on the phone talking to increasingly arrogant rude techs,I got nowhere and was given up on by THEM! I returned it,bought a belkin and got it working with out even needing to call support.I understand things can go wrong with IT stuff,but I have never have been more rudely treated.If you enjoy being abbused these are the people to deal with."
2,"Falls down under high load, heavy hack traffic, and interference","I have owned and installed this wireless router and have found it unsuitable for noisy and busy cable modem environments. This device is suitable in calm DSL environments and if you don't use a cable modem in a large city with lots of neighboring cordless phones, 2.4 GHz baby monitors, and other wireless networks. The router (wired and wireless) just cannot handle the simultaneous use of two computers on a wired network, a couple of laptops in a noisy wireless environment, and the automated hacker attempts coming in from the cable modem.Because this item is no longer easily ""flashed"" to use alternative software I can no longer recommend it. If you need a router I highly recommend you investigate the Belkin Wireless-G router series which work perfectly in all the above mentioned environments and have more features than this very expensive Linksys unit."
3,Load the newest Firmware!,I've had this router for a while(6 months) now and hated it until just recently. It would drop the signal every 10 minutes or so. When I loaded the new updated firmware from the Linksys web site my problems diappeared.Do yourself a favor find the new firmware as soon as you set it up it will tranfer much faster and I have yet to have a dropped connection.Inital set-up of this router is very difficult with their vague instructions. But right now I'm pretty happy. Good Luck!
1,No more Linksys products for me,Got this item and it drops internet access frequently. The only thing that fixes the problem is to power down the router. Linksys service is unresponsive even though the web is full of similar reports.No more Linksys products for me.
1,lack of address reservation makes this useless,"This router does not have ip address reservation that all my previous netgear routers have. This is a feature that I, and countless others NEED and is the only reason why I'm returning this and switching back to Netgear. Are you listening Linksys?"
1,If you're hacking the firmware DON'T get this version,I bought this by mistake and had to return it. Linksys has lowered the built in RAM on this router in newer versions and it will not run full versions of most open source firmware (like Tomato or DDR). I returned this and got the nice WRT54GL version and am happily running Tomato right now. Please don't get this by mistake if you want to hack the firmware...
3,didn't come with a wireless switch,This product doesn't come with a wireless on/off switch so even when I connected both of the computer by cable the wireless is still on. Not very healthy.
2,"Too low-powered, really lousy live support","We were very disappointed with this router for two reasons.First, it gave us a grand range of maybe 75 feet through one wall. And at that point the reception was rated ""very low"" by our IBM ThinkPad laptop. This limitation made this unit useless for our purposes.Second, we were never able to set it up downstream of our wired LAN switch and able to access the wired network in our home - no amount of ""help"" from LinkSys's hard-to-understand off-shore support people or fiddling based on LinkSys's FAQs made this work. As an aside, we were disconnected twice after a very long time of waiting and then trying to explain what we wanted to accomplish. There just wasn't a lot of savvy in the folks we talked with.Bottom Line - Beware if you need some reasonable range and if you want to do ANYTHING out of the ordinary.Sorry LinkSys, this one just didn't make it . . .GB"
4,Works great now after upgrading the firmware,"I am going to give this device 4 stars ... I was not happy with this device out of the box, had too many issues getting it set up, called linksys tech support, they were helpfull in getting it setup for me ... but still had issues. The good part came in where I upgraded the firmware on the router, thats all it took to get the thing humming like a charm! All in all happy with it now, but I would suggest upgrading the firmware as soon as you get it."
1,Designed Obsolescence!!!!,"Until today, my WRT54G has performed well, although I do recall initial configuration woes. Anyway, 6 months after the warranty .... pau. I go to use it after it had the night off and nothing. I couldn't understand a lick of the so-called English the guy in India tried so hard to speak and his bottom line was that it was a very old model (3.5 years) and he couldn't help me without my paying $29.95 to extend the warranty. Right. Linksys has lost me. I find it highly suspicious that it would just decide to die in its sleep."
4,"Works great, but Needs better Manual","Once set up, this has worked flawlessly. I have used several brands of routers in the past but all wired configs. This one is my first wireless. Once I figured out my set up, which I had to ask a friend with the same model, it worked/works flawlessly. They need a better manual. The set up wizard was OK but didn't address my particular situation. I would still recommend to anyone, however, despite my set up issues."
1,sucks,"Works great if you don't mind calling for tech. support everyday in order to get online. They outsource jobs so the accents vary all the way to completely uncomprehendable. They get a little frustrated when you have to keep saying ""What?"" all the time. My Indian isn't real good so...If you get one in the Phillapines you'll be lucky. You can understand them and they are very good. This is my fourth day in a row of 30 min. plus tech support and...oh never mind...It goes back to the store tomorrow."
1,Just didn't work.,"I've liked and used Linksys products in the past, but this simply didn't work. Two PCI adapters failed to associate to the router in three different machines. I was going to just exchange the router until I found that having the PCI adapter in my PC caused my first NIC to malfunction. What a waste of time."
1,Terrible router.,"This router is terrible. It comes with little to no instructions on how to actually use it. I spent 5+ hours trying to set it up, with no success, so I finally called their tech support. Their tech support is even worse than the actual product itself. Over the course of two weeks, I called 5 times, and everytime, they offered no actual help, but instead directed my to the same page ofn their website, even after I told them that I had already gone to that page, and was still having the same problem.Eventually, I managed to get it working, but I'm still having problems. When I boot up my computer, it only connects about 70% of the time. The other 30% of the time, I have to re-boot. Even if it does work, I'm lucky if it remains consistent for more than 10 minutes. It's constant disconnecting makes it very hard to do anything on the internet. Don't make my mistake. If you need a wireless router, go with D-Link or Belkin instead. Anything but Linksys."
2,Not for gaming,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU PLAN TO USE IT FOR GAMING I have had two of these routers thus far. The first one flat out burned up, and the second one is dropping internet connectivity anytime you do anything more than play an online game. If, god forbid, you want to play a game on one machine and surf the net on another, forget it. This router will drop your connection faster than Kim K dropped her second husband. Luckily for me, I have had this router for a few years now, so I am due for an upgrade."
1,"If 0 stars was an option, this would recieve it","I wasted about an hour of my life with this device. I opened the box and found no manual. Being a veteran technician this wasn't a concern. Or so I thought. It didn't configure automatically like it was supposed to, the internal software was a huge joke, and there was no mention of the Mac on this at all.Linksys needs to go back to the products that gave them a good reputation and they need to revert quickly. This isn't even worth fifty cents."
1,Stay away from Linksys,"This equipment and customer service does not warrent a star. In three months, am on my fourth router and third adapter. Customer service has been argumentative and impossible to reach (maybe that's a good thing!). And, to add insult to injury, they charge you to call them and request authorization to return their junk!"
2,TERRIBLE Tech Support/Customer Service,"This piece of equipment is not for the unskilled. If you think it's plug and go NOT! I'm still waiting for tech support, when reached they were rude, short and unhelpful. The on hold time was approximately 30 minutes each call, and then no HELP! It took me 2 days to figure out the conflict myself."
2,Unreliable,"Had this product for 2 months when it stopped accepting IP addresses from my cable modem. As a result I have to manually enter the numbers every few days for the router to work. After hours on hold, tech support was kind enough to tell me that the product was in fact defective but that there was really nothing they could do about it. Not recommended."
2,router with no instructions,I had the hardest time linking this router to my computer. I had to call my internet provider and they couldnt help me. I called Cisco and they told me that I needed a password (that i never got) otherwise they cant help me unless I had to pay $50 to speak to tecntion. I had to stay on the phone the phone with them for an hour inorder to resolve this problem. Not worth buying!
2,Don't waste your money,"I've had nothing but problems with this thing. At least 1 a day, more often 2-3, it goes down and I have to pull out the plug, count to 15, retry it, and repeat until I get a connection again. I called the representatives at Linksys to try and solve the problem and I got no help except, ""well it does that. You'll have to reset it each time."" Seriously, if I wanted that kind of hassle, I'd have stuck with dial-up and not bothered trying to go wireless."
2,Poor Signal Output,"We hooked this up to our main computer up in our bedroom and needed it to be able to use our laptop downstairs. We have a very small house and it puts out a ""low"" signal. I can't use my laptop in the kitchen which is very inconvenient."
3,Does not support AOL,"AOL will tell you all Linksys routers are supported, but they are incorrect. They do not support any 802.11g routers yet. Linksys doesn't make this info available until you run into problems. They tell you to buy the BEFW11S4."
2,"Works ok but lacks UPnP, signal quality",This product lacks UPnP feature at this time. Signal quality in second bedroom is very poor.
1,nothing but frustration,had problems...tech support hung up after putting me on hold for 10 min...2 days later and i'm going to try and get my money back...wish me luck
1,one star too much!,DOA. Outsourced customer service was a joke. Had me on the phone for 2 hours. Sent it back to amazon for a refund and have yet to see a credit.
1,complete junk,"I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled. Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best. When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router. Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.Stay away from this junk. Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink."
5,Great product,"If you follow the instructions, it should take you less than an hour to install the network and card adapters and have your wireless up and running. I had some questions and the 24 hour phone support was very helpful, nice guys. I highly recommend this product."
1,Junk,"Big and small problems -- requires a cable to initiate setup, complains when internet not connected, requires (for me) at least daily reboot, low signal strength unless nodes are close, etc. I'm giving mine away, and will replace with Belkin N1, which has great reviews for ease of setup and reliability, with mediocre performance. I'm not running a data warehouse, and don't anticipate a performance problem with the Belkin for my home/office application."
3,Ship order,I have recently buy a linksys router can you purchase it??¿?¿? the mont was charched to my credit card so can u sent me the track number?¿?¿? please tanks....
1,Complaint,"I ordered this product from Amazon.com and was very excited to get this in, set it up, had problems and called Linksys. I was told that this product does not support AOL, and to go with another model. This will probably be the last Linksys product I buy"
1,I HATE ROUTERS!!!!,THIS WIRELESS TRASH IS A LUXURY FOR NERDS. DON'T BUY IT UNLESS U KNOW ALOT ABOUT WIRELESS ROUTERS. YOU WILL HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THE INSTALLATION IF U DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT NETWORKS. THAT'S WHY I HATE ROUTERS. EPECIALLY THIS LINKSYS GARBAGE.
1,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router is garbage!,The Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router is a piece of garbage (or whatever)! I spent over 2 hours online with Linksys Technical Support and 1 hour at my local computer repair shop. No one could get it to work properly with my IBM Thinkpad. What a waste of time and money. I returned it...
1,Worst piece of junk ever,"i can't even begin to explain how bad this product is. Quite frankly, it's a disgrace to America as we know it. For this company to have the audacity to actually sell this thing is beyond me. What they have basically done is taken a piece of metal and shoved some wires in it and have claimed it can give one wireless internet. I would rather have spent the money wasted on this product on something more useful, for instance lobbying congress to eliminate this product."
3,Clear a day in your schedule,I have v8 of this router and it was a 7-hour long struggle to install it. I'm fairly tech savvy but there's a crucial but mostly hidden firmware upgrade that apparently the router WILL NOT FUNCTION WITHOUT at linksys.com/connectAnd contrary what I've read in other reviews here it can definitely be installed using OSX in fact I would probably still be setting it up if we weren't a cross-platform household.Now that it's up and running though I have no complaints. We just retired a Netgear router that was much easier to install but dying. Our connection speeds have doubled from what they had been on our fading hub.
5,Excellent Router!!!,I had no problem with this router. I never lose connection. I highly recommend this product.
4,Linksys WRT54GL- great product!,"Bought this wireless router on sale from Amazon, free shipping, and am very pleased with the results. The shipping was fast and packaged well. The WRT54GL router works great with my Dell desktop (ethernet connected) and with our two laptops (Dell and Toshiba). All are running Windows XP Pro. We have a decent signal throughout our two story house, and have had no disconnects.The only problem was getting initial setup configured, which turned out to be a ""bridge mode"" with the Windstream modem (hit reset for 5 seconds). It would have been nice if the DSL provider or Linksys had mentioned such a step in their documentation...instead I spent several hours trying various passwords and two calls to tech support in India.Overall I am happy and highly recommend this wireless router to all new users. The 54 mbps is good enough for me, but I am interested in the updated N when it comes around."
1,Useless,"Could not get the Linksys software to load on my older computer, running 98SE, or my new notebook, running XP. Returned to Amazon, went to Walmart and bought a Belkin, was up and running on both computers in 10 minutes."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH APPLE OSX,After talking to others who have this router i realize that it doe's not work with apple. I wish i had known that when i bought it. linksys will not acknowledge this and when I first received it i read minimum requirements on the box which does not include mac osx and called them they told me not to worry they could set it up for me. and they did. and it worked for a few days. i have now sent back 2 routers (having to pay postage of course) and if i had not bought another brand would probablly still be sending back more.I't works for a few days or hours and then everything has to be reset. again and again. their coustomer support is very nice and i have spent too many hours talking to them.
2,Didn't fly,"I am rating this with two stars rather than one or none, because LYNKSYS does seem to have good customer support options in place. But despite phone support, online support and user forums, I could not get this router set up to work. Sorry. I sent it back and my purchase price was refunded."
4,"Good coverage and good performance, not too easy to configure","Gives me better performance than any other devices I used before.To enable the encription, I had difficulties, the menu is confusing."
5,Nice Basic Router,"I like this router. I am not very savvy when it comes to computer technology, but it was a breeze setting this router up(if I can do it, anyone can). I just used the installation cd. I have a two story home and I can use my laptop all over the house, even with the doors shut. I have not lost the signal yet. I do have thin walls though. I only use my laptop for web surfing, emailing, etc. I don't transfer files so I can't say anything about the transfer speed. Overall, This is an easy router to set up and great for sharing an internet connection."
1,Don't buy this version 5,Do not buy this new version 5 if you ever want to upgrade the firmware with 3rd party enhancements. This new verison 5 don't run on Linux anymore and the memory is only half of version 1-4.
1,Version 5 gets Zero Stars,"Version 5 of this router, the one Amazon is shipping, does not work well.They changed the programming of the router to use a new, probably cheaper chip. This means 2 things. Only one of which matters to 99% of the population.1. It no longer runs Linux, and can no longer be upgraded with 3rd party linux software (technically firmware). This matters very much to people who were upgrading their $60 router to run a business, or to people who wanted to improve the range and functionality of the router.2. For most of us, who just want something we can run out of the box, this thing still doesn't work well. Signal is weak. It freezes up constantly, wired and wireless.Go out and find a version 4 or below on eBay, or in a store. Something WITHOUT a serial # (on the box) that starts with CDFB."
3,Initial setup is a pain,"Initial set up was a pain, It was so hard to understand the instruction manual, but later on once the set up was complete it worked fine. signal strength was 54 mbps most of the time."
2,Its Just OK.,Good for the average user who whats the speed of 802.11G 54Mbs but for the money u can get an 108mbs that's just as good. I bought this thinking that it was a V.4 for various reasons mainly that it was Linux based but no it's a v.5 and not impressed. Like I said there are other products that are faster and in the same price range some even from Linksys. So if u want a solid router with good security this is an o.k. buy.
3,Mediocre WiFi Router,"Having experience with b routers, when I first bought this I was dissapointed with the range. Out of the box, it works fine, but when you configure security settings, that's when the problems start. Also, the router does not support tools I depend on like Remote Desktop Sharing, Netmeeting, Windows Messenger and etc. I returned it for a NetGear WGR614 and am much happier."
2,Has problem,"I don't know if this problem has been fixed in newer versions, but version 3 has a problem with port forwarding where it tracks old connections for 5 days which cause it to quickly stop working when you use any P2P app such as uTorrent or Limewire or anything else that creates a lot of connections. After I had this problem and my wireless internet stopped working, I tried upgrading the firmware to DD-WRT but that made it worse so I tried changing the firmware back to the latest linksys build but it still won't broadcast the internet. (I can see and connect to the network it creates, but the internet doesn't work even when I'm connected.) I'm done trying to troubleshoot this stupid thing and will never buy this model again. But like I said, mine is v3 and newer version may not have this problem."
4,Works Great!,"I've been using it for about a year with my Dell laptop & works great! Just put a wireless PCI card in my OLD school Dell desktop & added a Canon MP620 wireless printer last nite... everything works swell! I'm not a huge tech nerd & don't know if it's the best router out there, but I certainly don't have anything to [...] about. VIVA VIAGRA!!!"
5,Non-Expert User,"I'm not a computer expert, though this is at least the 5th router I've installed on a home network (I end up helping friends who are way less ""expert"" than I am). I've had this installed for three years now and no problems at all. Installations, including setup, was pretty easy and I haven't had any issues at all since, so I'd say I have to recommend based on that."
5,Great for DD-WRT and modding,"This Linkysys WRT54G router has many revisions that make minor changes to its hardware design. Depending on your revision, you may be able to place 3rd partry firmware like DD-WRT that can make the router more powerful and customizable. Although the router isn't 802.11n, it is a reliable router and can be easily found found for a low price on third party websites."
1,Warranty Expired on Product,"We purchased a new wireless router only to discover that the product was three years old and the warranty had expired. I am shocked atAmazon for this behavior. Since we had to install the router at a rental property, we did not have the choice of returning it within 30 days for credit. Amazon should have sent us a new one and extended the day return policy."
3,Does not have removable antenna,"As noted in some of the reviews, this product has evolved over the years.In particular, my version does NOT have a removable antenna. This is important if you want to replace the antenna with a larger one or attach a signal booster. Many of these signal-boosting products state that they are compatible with the WRT54G, but they are not always.My model is a V8, and the antenna is definitely not removable.I've had mine for a couple of years, and it works well (although with a pretty small range). It also needs to be rebooted every other month or so, which is quite annoying."
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars.,"I have had this router for over a year and it has been nothing but trouble and headaches since day 1. It's just extremely unreliable. It goes to ""limited or no connectivity"" multiple times a day--often dozens of times a day. It loses the connection completely when trying to view streaming video. I recently replaced it with a Netgear wireless router, which works perfectly. And now the Linksys wireless router is where it belongs... in the trash."
1,Linksys WRT54G is a dud for Apple/Macintosh use,"Avoid this product like the plague. After discovering that there are zero instructions for Mac users, and after over one hour on the phone with out-sourced tech support, this baby is going back in the box AND back to the big box store. My old Linksys was great: easy to set up and reliable. So sad to have to switch brands!"
5,An amazing router with tons of extra features,"I've had this Linksys router. For more than a year, and it is totally reliable. No down time, great signal strength. Worth every penny plus for those who are really into networking. There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features. Setup is totally breeze and Linksys's web site is pretty easy to navigate.Now this router is not the cheapest on the market. But if you want to get into networking and running wireless. The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion.I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay. Nothing came to mind. So the pretty solid router all around good for the moneyhere's the link to firmware updateshttp://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html"
1,Useless router,"Don't ever buy this router. I changed my wireless router from Netgear to Linksys because my roommate took away his Netgear router. After careful thoughts and considering the big discount availbale in December 2006, I bought this router. It works fine untill I am alone on the network. When a couple or more of my friends come over to my apartment, it disconnects and we have to restart it every 15 minutes. I spent a lot of time on it changing its configuration settings. And I called Linksys support guys, even they could not solve the problem. At the end they concluded that the router is not working so they sent me the new router of the same model. But the problem is the same. Even I tried it with default factory settings. Whenever 2 or more wireless computers access the network, it goes down. Moreover, I have also confirmed that my modem (Motorolla SB5120) is perfectly fine because it works if I connect with it directly."
1,This router is garbage!!!!,"This router worked OK when used with a wired network, but beware if you go wireless! First I tried it with a Wii. Worked ok for like 2 days, then the internet connection on the PC the router was connected to kept going up and down and then finally stopped all together. It is a DSL connection. So I reset the whole router, reinstalled all software and it worked ok for another 2 days connected to the Wii and then the same thing happened. So I eventually stopped using the Wii wirelessly. Wwll, 2 months later I bought a new laptop. Connected to the router fine for a while. Now the same thing is happening with that as with the Wii and I know the DSL modem is fine after testing that. DO NOT BUY!"
2,okay,I wouldn't but another one the range sucks on it unless you plan on being in the same room or very close to it don't expect to get a good signal.
2,Requires a Network Specialist,"The WRT54G works intermitantly. When it goes down, you have to reset or download new firmware or generally spend hours trying to figure out what went wrong with it. Definitely high maintenance and I consider myself fairly knowledgable and patient, but I resent having to spend a weekend futzing around with it to get it to work. Buy this router only if you like spending time doing this sort of thing and have a fairly good knowledge of Internet protocol, WLAN and LAN. Also, if you have more than one computer connected, the problems jump exponentially. I have a desktop, two laptops and a Blackberry. It can't handle multiple devices connected to it. If you have a live-in network specialist, it may work fine for you. I am now down on all Cisco/Linksys products. Why can't they make a product that works out of the box?"
4,Good Router,"I had the same product a while back, and it used to have some trouble of dis-connecting computers from the internet and re-connect a few seconds after, but I have not observed the same kind of problem with this new router...Also, I think they added some more support to this router now, even though it's the same model. It used to be the simple WPA encryption for wireless internet protection about 3 years ago, but now it is upgraded to include WPA2 encryption, which is supposely better protection."
4,Works great (now),"I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!Great performance, better price, easy setup. An excellent product all around.The only reason I give it 4 stars is the early difficulties I had, which have been overcome."
3,incomplete documentation,"On the wireless side, the router communicates well with my 802.11g notebook adapter. Setup was easier than easy with WinXP Home.On the WAN side however, I absolutely can not get this thing to talk to my Comcast cable modem. Comcast tech support refused to touch the issue. To their credit, the Linksys web site offers specific and easy to follow instructions for what to do to configure their routers to communicate with with Comcast cable modems. Alas, when I attempted to configure the router as described, the settings would not save.I'm going back to my old Linksys ethernet router which works just fine."
5,fine performance....,"for those that have been having problems with non-linksys hardware, new firmware is out as of 1/29/03 which should fix many issues.for me, the beauty here is that 802.11G hardware will dumbdown to work on an 802.11B network (cafe's and other hotspots). i could care less if 802.11B technology works on my G network."
2,Router defective after attempting to set up,"I got this new router and after going to the CD setup, and getting proper info from the DSL ISP, the router did not connect to the pc. Using the reset switch was of no effect. Left for a day an try again. Same issue. Used Linksys help desk, good support but the blinking light (defective) did not go away. Have to be returned. I had very good experience with a previous Linksys ""wired"" router but now... this sets Linksys back..."
1,Poor compatability with 802.11B,"I bought this router to work with th legacy 802.11B and newer 802.11g devices. It has compatability issues with many of the b devices I have used it with. Further, the range is worse than it was with my old Linksys (802.11b only) router. Technical support was pretty poor. They would deny that they had heard of problems, but then slipped that there were patches in the works. Hmmm. I would not recommend this router. I replaced it after a few weeks with a Siemens 802.11B only model with far better performance overall."
5,wonderful product,"I've been using this product since 8/15/03 with little or no problems. The only problems have been solved by resetting it, and that only a couple of times. My kids are thrilled that they can use their computers anywhere in the house. I'm no technophile, but had no trouble setting up or adding machines since we've had it. It is very very fast."
5,Great Router. Easy to setup & easy to use.,"I'm new to the wireless scene and I chose to go with Linksys because their prodcuts have never let me down, so I picked up the WRT54G Router & WMP11 802.11b PCI card for my computer. Very easy to set up, with in 15 minutes I was online surfing the web. It's giving me a about 70% signal strength with the router being upstairs and my computer being several rooms away. I have been able to receive wireless signal across the street from my PDA with decent signal levels, I'm just waiting for my new notebook PC to see how well the signal strength is on the go."
5,Works as advertised...,"Not a geek but needed to lose my dial up connection. No cable connection in my computer rooms and I didn't want to drill holes in the walls so I put the WRT54G next to the cable modem and cable (TV) receiver with the kitchen tv. Installed a WMP54G PCI adapter card in both computers and spent the day futzing. Once I realized I had bad cables going to the modem and that I had to put the splitter before the tv receiver, things went well. Had to call tech support 2-3 times...got through within 10 minutes. Techs had thick accents but I listened closely and they solved my problems in just a few minutes. Speed is wonderful, stability is great. Helps to read instructions carefully before attempting install...the CD's for the adapter cards are for Win ME and 2K, NOT XP. My XP pro did most of the install and configuration once I left it alone. Nice set up. Very satisfied overall and I learned a great deal about networking as I worked through my problems."
4,works in Mac environment,"I didn't want to spend $200 for airport just because it's made for macs. Instead, I bought this linksys. The drawbacks are that you can't plug a USB printer into it for wireless printing AND you can't use Appletalk. But if all you really want is wireless internet and don't mind walking to the printer, then it's worth saving $140. Linksys says it doesn't support Mac, but it works fine. It is a little confusing getting it all set up with no Mac manual, but still it only took me about 45 minutes. The key thing is to have everything powered off when you connect the router. Then just go to the IP address (it's supplied in the paperwork) and configure it for security, etc. Pretty strong signal ... probably not as strong as Airport, but I'm streaming Internet radio right now and my husband is surfing on the hard-lined iMac and I haven't had to buffer."
1,Same bad luck here,"I get the impression that either this works for you or it doesn't. It depends on a number of things, including your internet service. I use Road Runner and when I plug their cable modem into the WRT54G, it runs sometimes but sooner or later in any case, I lose the internet. I've searched online and tried any number of fixes, none of which work. When my modem is plugged into my 2004 era router, 802.11b, it works fine. Maybe the problem is mobile phone interference from the neighbors. Who knows? But it does not work for me and it might not for you."
4,Good wireless router,"After initial setup problems, and two separate calls to tech support, the router is working great providing great coverage to all the house, a large two story house.The problem resulted from ISP conflict between the modem and the router. The documentation doe not deal with this issue."
3,first install good.....upgrade not so good.,"I bought this item because I wanted to upgrade from a ""B"" router to a ""G"" router. The automatic setup did not work for me. I even worked with customer support to get this router work. No help what so ever. I ended up casacading it with my current router instead of upgrading. The product is good as far as signal strength and range. I would recommend this router as a first time setup but not a upgrade. Its just too aggravating."
4,Easy to use and very stable,"The Linksys WRT54G Wireless was an excellent buy. Reasonably easy to set up, and very reliable. I've only had it for about 2 months, but I've never had to reset it due to a lost connection."
3,Works fine; zero support for the MAC; buggy setup,"Works fine, but doesn't even mention the MAC in its instructions--booo! The setup is buggy and will require you to reset the thing and start over numerous times to get it right."
3,WARNING: WILL NOT SUPPORT 3RD PARTY FIRMWARE,"Pretty lame router, go for the WRT54GL. This is the version 5 model, which actually has _Less_ flash RAM than the previous models."
2,WAP54G v5 - Not that great..,"I upgraded my Linksys 802.11b (which always worked fine) to this ""g"" model for the improved speed. I have been disappointed with its performance. Initially, I noticed it was SLOWER than my old router. After reading reviews on the internet (which I should have done before I bought it) I learned of many complaints about version 5. I hurried to my office and flipped over the router and there it was, v.5 on the bottom. Reading on, I learned about the firmware updates so I downloaded them which helped improve the speed a bit. Now, the problem is streaming video. With my old router, I used to be able to watch movie trailers and other streaming feeds. This v.5 stutters and locks up the video. If I can't resolve this problem I will likely find another router."
5,Linksys - my favorite,"I bought this router last week, from Amazon, despite the fact that there were many reviews claiming that it is really hard to install it and it takes hours of fone-call with linksys support to set it up and all that. But the real fact is it took me less than 15 minutes to install it. I spent more than 5 minutes of this time trying to pry open the packaging. It worked with my 802.11b card as well as my 802.11g wireless card instantly. The range is very good too."
4,"Good, but Wizard needs work","I recently purchased the LinkSys WRT54G router to replace a D-Link DI-604. The D-Link router has been flawless but with the recent acquisition of a laptop it was time to go wireless. Because of the past performance of the D-Link box I was all set to try the wireless version. After reading the reviews on Amazon and what ever I could find it appeared that people were happier with the LinkSys product.It as been running for a week with no problems except for initial setup. If it starts to fail I will most certainly write a update. The big problem with set up is that it did not recognize we use DSL and as such need to login to the DSL modem using an account name and password. After bailing out of the ""wizard"" and setting it up manually all was good."
2,Installation problems,"First time installation was problematic. I had to call the Linksys help desk for support. Linksys customer service was surprisingly responsive and helpful. Once installed, the unit performed well. However, I moved to another state recently and had to re-install the router to a new cable modem. At first it seemed fine, but then it could not detect the signal. Called Linksys help desk again and they determined the router became defective. Only purchased it 4 months ago, so I'm a bit disappointed with the product."
1,Linksys Router,"I was unable to get this router to work despite spending many, many hours researching, and working with Linksys customer service. I have returned it, and purchased a D-Link which is functioning correctly."
1,Poor tech help!!!,"I was having a problem with my laptop ""talking"" to my printer. I purchased the WRT54G at Linksys suggestion to resolve the problem. It did not work. I called Linksys. After playing the telephone tree for almost 10 minutes I was answered by someone whose English must be her 4th or 5th language. They wanted to call me back and hung up on me!!! So much for award winning service. I'm going to return this router and remember not to buy anything from Linksys or Cisco if I think I'm going to need technical support."
4,would recommand this product,Easy to install and friendly customer service. Had my router up and running in a matter of an hour. Much better then any other router I had by far.
4,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router,"Excellent product. Easy to install and set up, especially in the unsecure mode but the secure mode only requires a couple more steps.Very reliable and has excellent range."
4,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router,This product works flawlessly. I bought it to replate the D-Link which used to crash at least once every three days. Very happy with this Linksys.
3,Decent router - get what you pay for,"This router is solid for the price. In a wired environment, it is reliable and fast. The wireless is a little spotty - my connection speed bounces around quite a bit while not moving (and not being particularly far from the router). Logging into the router to make changes is simple, and the options are easy to use. For the price, I can't complain."
1,Many Problems,"I was drawn to the Linksys name given their reputation of quality. But, this model is terrible. I updated the firmware to the latest available with no luck. It randomly disconnects from the internet for all connections both wired and wireless. It also randomly freezes with no access to the internet or to the unit itself. I tried two identical units in the event the first one was defective. But, no. Both behaved the same way. I'm returning the second one as well for a refund and will buy a D-Link locally. My wired router is a D-Link and I've never had any problems at all."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Life is too short to deal with the horrible customer service provided by Linksys. I bought this product and had trouble setting up my network. I called the customer support department, and after waiting on hold for 40 minutes, I was told ""Sorry, can't help you. We are not specialized enough to help you with a network,""! Not only that, but they couldn't even give me a number for someone who could. Unbelievable.This wireless network had replaced a Dell wireless network and I am sorry I ever changed. Dell really does have the best customer service department in the industry.Again, don't waste your time with Linksys."
2,Unhappy Customer,I purchased this router to replace a D-Link router that stopped working after 4 years of service. The WRT54G router actually slowed down my connection. The Linksys support link told me to take it back to the store which I did but the replacement was the same. Everytime that I called Linksys they would have me go through the same process and finally told me that it was my computer (which works fine without the Linksys router). This statement was followed up by the tech support hanging up on me. I don't believe this router is worth the trouble.
1,very slow for gaming and poor support,"Bought this and the matching G USB port, but the G is so slow that Inet Gaming is impossible with this box. I called tech support and was connected to someone in India, who could not speak English well-enough to communicate... so returned it."
5,Great Product,"Bought the router and access point along with a wireless g pcmcia card by linksys, and have had absolutely no problems. Set up was extremely simple. I didn't even need the software that came with the router. I am running a total of four computers off the router: two wired PC's running XP, a wireless laptop running XP, and a mac running OS 9.2. Only thing I recomend is to be sure to turn on WEP because it is not automatically turned on and is an important security feature."
4,set up not easy but Linksys helpful,"the setup is on a cd, but it errored out on me. I had to call linkys support to get it to get to the website for setup.every step of the way it didnt work as the setup guide said. I had to call linksys 3 times. they were helpful & gave me a direct # to call so I didnt enter the que. SOunds like tech support was in India, but I had minor problems understanding."
3,Less than expected,"I had heard good things about this product and with a bit of patience it works as advertized. I am always a bit leary of a product that warns me to install software before trying to use it and there it was in big bold red letters. Problem is the software is for Windows and I use Macs, so the software is useless to me.Really, just using the browser utility for setup works fine, it won't explode if you don't load the software. Some of the configuration is confusing and it's not clear when you change a parameter that it actually was changed. This was most evident when changing the channel from the default. I like the built in switch function, it works as a default. The signal strength is good and the product is reasonably priced."
3,Decent router once I got one that worked,"I had a lot of problems with my past Linksys routers. I ended up having to send about 3 of them back before I finally ended up with one that is working fairly well now. I have to reset it about once or twice a week when everything just freezes up. From what I've been told, this is common with routers. I have much better help when I call linksys than when I email them."
4,Satisfied overall,"Installation was straightforward and easier that I thought it might be. Performance is good with one exception. Every so often, maybe once a week, I lose the signal/connection for a period of five minutes or so. It comes back by itself and I don't have to do anything, except wait, so it's not a big problem but it does happen. I'm guessing that this is a problem with wireless signals in general and not this router but I don't know for sure.Other than that it's great. Range is good, the router is at one end of the house and my laptop picks up the signal all the way over on the other side."
4,Pretty good,"Easy to install, helpful user guide, convenient browser based management interface. It's really a good choice."
5,Great value!,I get excellent internet connectivity with my laptop and desktop in our two story home. It was easy to install and inexpensive buy. I'd recommend this product.
1,This is junk,"I tried the wrt54g and after 4 days on the linksys chat line 2 phone calls and 1 replacement it would not stop resetting itself I upgraded the firmware and tried everything they had to fix the problem and it still doesn't work. It will work for a couple hours but when I wake up it says ""you have changed networks"" then when you run the advisor it won't even recognise the router. This junk don't waste your time or money. Get a wireless router from your internet provider and save yourself a big headache."
1,Why did Linksys Have to Change it,"This router use to be great, but with the new version 5 it's only got half the memory and can't be my 4rd party firmware installed.Any serious wireless people... don't buy this one."
2,I was told to bring it back and find a version 4,"I just purcahse a version 5 of the wrt54g. Everything seemed to be working great untill i did a speed test. my computer hard wired into the lan port, horrible download speed (normally 5000kbps, behind router - 250-800 kbps. Called tech supp. after 3 hours, i was told, to bring unit back and try to find a version 4 of the router, that they didnt have a 'stable' firmware yet. they could not tell me if this unit was bad or it was by design. I would definitly avoid this unti untill a few firmware updates are out."
5,wireless ease,I hooked this up to my mac and it was just plug and play.I have 3 computers that all connect wirelessly.This brand consistently develops superiorwireless products. I totally recommend buying this product
2,Don't be fooled,"I guess the network aspect worked fine (I am assuming this because I don't know what the heck a network). But the salesman promised me that I would be able to achieve cold fusion with this and a rubber band. But don't be fooled, it doesn't work."
4,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router,Very nice to be wireless in the house. Cable is more reliable but this is a very good alternative.
1,ANYTHING BUT LINKSYS!!!,"Buy any brand BUT Linksys! I've had nothing but problems with Linksys from the start! Customer Service is non-existent! If you do finally get help with someone who works for Linksys inside the United States, and they let you return a defective product, kiss it good-bye! I'm STILL waiting for my warranty return to be replaced. UPS delivered it, but Linksys is so incompetent, they can't seem to find it! GET ANY BRAND BUT LINKSYS!!!!"
2,Very limited.,Does not allow port forwarding unless the target computer has statically assigned IP. Here is the exact text from the setup page: Any PC whose port is being forwarded must have its DHCP client function disabled and must have a new static IP address assigned to it because its IP address may change when using the DHCP function. That alone is a huge -ve.
1,Bad Experience,"Purchased this router to set up a home network with a new laptop. On the box I took comfort in the advertised 24/7 customer support. I had trouble configuring the network and establishing the advertised security features. I called the customer support 800 number. My call went to India. I had allot of trouble understanding what the support tech was saying. In the end, the call was useless as the tech took the position that as long as each computer could access the internet there was no issue with the router. I'm now at a loss for setting up my system and am contemplating return of the unit."
1,0 Stars Wouldn't Be Low Enough for Linksys,"Before anybody comes to the defense of Linksys, they should read some of the horror stories. My Linksys router would not function properly on either of my PCs, both produced by different manufacturers. The customer support was non-existent. In fact, attempts to contact customer support were ignored.Only after I purchased a New Gear router did I learn what reliable wireless Internet was all about.I agree with the reviewer who compared his Linksys router to ET for the Atari 2600. Pure trash. Even the design is poor. My Net Gear router is less than half the size.If you buy Linksys, be sure you know where the reset button is on their router. Also be sure you know how to reset your Internet connection. If you have a Linksys and it works, you are lucky. I assure you that if you ever had to contact their tech support, you would sing a very unhappy tune."
2,extremely frustrated,"from day one, this product has caused me trouble. it didn't work straight out of the box. I was on hold waiting for tech support for over 2 hours. my wired connection works fine on my pc while the network is up and running. It goes down 1-2 times a day, and I need to unplug and replug it. It works fine with my mac laptop, but it's not a linksys network card. And the most major problem is the poor signal being received by my other pc on a wireless linksys card about 250 feet away from the router. even when it does get a strong connection, the dsl speed is often slower than a 56k modem. tech support say I need another wired router (another $99) to make my connection work. even if it's true, it doesn't account for the network going down every day. wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Constant dropping,"We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless. It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow. It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes. The tech support is worthless too."
1,Worthless!,"I could not get this thing to work, even with an call to Linksys tech support. I returnedit for a refund. if you have a Macintosh, you be better off with an Airport base station."
1,wish there was a rating below one star,I bought one of these about 7-8 months ago well i had it maybe 1 week before the outboard ports for ethernet cables would not send any internet to the comp. then i tried it with a wireless card and it worked about 12 hours and then quit. Guys at best buy and a friend of mine said its fried. Bought a belkin router and it works perfect now.Assumption: Linksys routers are not very good
1,don't buy it,It constantly loses the connection and it requires reboots. I updated to the latest firmware and it's even worse.
1,Junk. 1 Year Life Max on 2 Units,"Bought one. Died after 13 months (1 year warranty of course). Went to big box store and they said it does happen sometimes. Bought another one. Died after 14 months. Both units worked fine and never required resetting or rebooting. They worked great, until they up and died. Customer service was absolutely no help. Suggested I reset or reboot and when that didn't work, they were out of ideas. What great tech support! I give up on Cisco. I bought a Netgear router for a couple bucks less and paid $10 for a 2 year warranty."
2,Perhaps I'm just an idiot but...,"I set the wireless router up according to the instructions in order to add a notebook computer to my AOL account. Worked like a champ for about 48 hours. Then, certain web sites would no longer load on my desktop that is connected to the router via ethernet cable (particularly web sites that require a log in). After another 48 hours or so, I could not access the web at all. I had to reboot the router and reload the software, and the whole process repeated itself. I have no idea what the problem is."
1,dont buy this !,"I bought one and its inpossible to use. I couldnt get the WLAN to work. When I plugged in the power , after 10 seconds the router would lose the WLAN mac address and then no wireless clients could connect anymore. The linksys people were clueless also , the sent me 3 different firmwares, but none worked ( even beta ones). In the end I returned the product"
3,"Interoperability, a pipe dream?","Well I unpacked this and set it up with a few minor glitches here and there, but eventually they all ironed themselves out. The big straw breaker though was the fact that the wireless router would stop working with my ADSL router after about 5 minutes. No real apparent reason, it would just stop communicating.I am still not sure as to which device is the culprit, but I did manage a work around by using a cross over cable from the ADSL router into the switch (LAN) portion of the wireless device. I then just put in static IPs since this is the only place I will probably be using the wireless aspect.Just thought I would throw this out there in case anyone else is having similar problems.Other than the price it might be nice to have a monoply company out there, as long as they get all their gear to work together in harmony."
4,It is a good deal to have it for your family,"It is very good to have it from Amazon, I am totally satisfied with it. I finally gave up buying it from BESTBUY for a simple reason - the price.This model is just good for the use of family or small groups, you can use either wireless connection for your computers in different rooms, or easily connect your up to 4 PCs with RJ45 cable, flexible and convenient.I used to have 3Com router, it was not bad too, but for wireless router, Linksys has the best ROI now. Hope the management page has a better GUI(acutually it has been improved a lot than its previous versions) in its upgrade support in the future.H."
3,Router worth it?,I had a lot of trouble getting router to work with the assistance of Linksys help line. Internet with router is noticeably slower than without. The main advantage is getting internet reception on a laptop wirelessly.
2,No support for Mac,"Bought this router for my home - it works fine with my roommate's Windows PC but just refused to with my Macbook. It didn't come with any detailed instructions, only a one-click installation CD which runs only on Windows. Tried pretty much everything I could find on the internet but failed. ""Linksys customer service does not support MAC"" - thats the one line response I got when I called them for assistance. Would have returned it but a friend put in a round-about fix to make it work .. but even with that I need to change a list of settings each time I switch between home and school. It is painful but it works!"
1,Nothing But Problems,"Run!!! Don't walk away from the piece of junk. The 1st one I had was DOA, the 2nd has died on a simple Firmware upgrade. This router has been nothing but problems for the 2 days I have owned it. Their customer support hours are bad so it will be easier for me to get a refund. Thanks Linksys, looks like it is time for a Netgear router."
1,Linksys is garbage,"I replaced my existing wireless router (same model, just decided to die one day) with another one. After about 2 hrs on the phone with tech support in India, we came to the realization that the model was broken - the tech support guy said he knew of a very large shipment of these that were all faulty. I'm returning it, dumping linksys altogether and getting this one:http://www.belkin.com/wireless/product.html"
1,...wish I'd paid extra for Airport...,"I have not had a great deal of success with this product as a wireless station. It works wells as a router, but I puchased it specifically to operate as a wireless hub. In order to activate the wireless connection, I have to unplug the router, only then will my laptop pick up the signal. After approx 10-15 minutes, the signal is lost and I have to unplug and router again.........what a pain! I sorely regret not buying an Airport Hub, especially now that they have that handy little Express one! I feel the Linksys was a waste of money - anyone want to buy a used Router?"
2,Cheaper but slow signal,"This product is cheaper but in my experience dont work with good signal, sometimes my laptops loose the signal in small space, maybe are designed to work in very small distance. But i use it in my home and dont work like i wish"
5,Works great....,"The product works really nice...For mac users, do not follow the instructions that come with the package since they are for PC. For a mac follow these steps (they worked for me)Switch OFF your modem, router and mac.Connect Modem to Router and Router to mac using an ethernet cable.Switch on the modem and wait for a minute.Then switch on the Router and wait for a minute.Then boot your Mac.Go to http://192.168.1.1 and set up the router...."
4,"Easy Setup, so-so uptime, inconsistant connection","Bought this router along with two PCMCIA cards for laptops and one PCI adapter for a desktop.Setup couldn't have been simpler. Plug the cards in, and run the software.My only complaints are that first, I have no 2.4GHz phones in the house, and without running the microwave I still experience loss of signal. I can't figure out why so I'm going to have to keep moving the router around the house until I can find a better place for it.Second, I use my laptop on the desk next to my desktop and at times I'll loose connection on my desktop but my laptop will still have a solid 60%+ signal.Overall weighing the (roughly) 15% downtime vs. living in a 3 story house where running CAT5 is not an option, I am satisfied enough that I will not be returning this networking setup."
3,WRT54G restarted,A few time my Router WRT54G restarted without reason. I have the latest firmware but the problem persist.
1,bad mass-produced product,"i bought the Linksys WRT54G a couple years ago (v1) and encryption never really quite worked (WEP or WPA); the connections would always be excruiatingly slow, or there would be no connection. then one fine morning i woke up to find it inexplicably bricked and it was a dead unit. so i complained to Linksys and fortunately they shipped a new unit (v4). unfortunately, this unit also had defective WEP/WPA connections. after being frustrated, i decided to scrap Linksys altogether and opt for a Buffalo G54 Cable/dsl Router with aoss instead -- Buffalo products are 1) cheaper 2) easier to set up 3) WEP/WPA works out of the box 4) more compatible with Macs 5) could double-up as a Wireless Access Point (using Repeat mode)."
3,could always be better!,"I'm a college student living with 4 other roommates so the wireless works area-wise in our apartment. Speed of connection is pretty good too. The only bad thing is the connection goes off every now and then which is really annoying. All you have to do is turn the router off and on and it'll work again but it would be great if the router just worked 24/7. Other than that, it works great - doesn't take up much space either!"
2,Satisfactory,"I really don't like it. I mean it works, it's pretty fast, and the software that comes with it is pretty good. There's just something about it that bugs me. Maybe once a week or every other week I have to unplug the thing and plug it back in because both the computer that's directly connected to it and the wirelessly connected computer suddenly won't get any info from it. Both computers will say they're connected but you won't get anywhere on the internet. I don't really know what the problem is. I know other people that give this item rave reviews. I think next time i buy a wireless router i may look into the NetGear."
3,Poor Quality Hardware,I'd been using this for just under 2 months and It died on me. After spending 2 hours on the phone with tech support I've sent the unit to linksys for a replacement.
4,"Stable, VERY easy to set up and install",I found this router VERY easy to set up and install. Very good performance so far. Good security.
1,router,no cd to install told to download was unable too not able to comment on router itselfwill return item to shipper in 3 days
1,Linksys Router,It crapped out 2 days after the time to send it back expired. I'm done with Linksys. Am going to go for a new product. Maybe Netgear.
3,router,does not support linux microsoft trys to have every thing .this is usa it is a few country we can buy what we want to these companies need to learn that .
5,LINKYS,"I have wireless all through my duplex, upstairs and down with a strong wireless connection.Im satisfied with this product."
5,Setup was easy.,"This linksys was a real breeze to setup. I bought it for my dorm because there was only one ethernet socket with three people in the room and we didn't want to use a switch; that would mean we would have cables all over the place. It comes with a CD that guides you with a step by step procedure, so even if you're a novice computer user, you can still setup your router how you'd like."
3,Good,"Works well, sometimes there are some issues with the signal probably because there are a lot of wireless router on the same building. you can solve the problem changing the frequency."
1,shipfor lees,"I purchase this wr-G router and 2 monhts later the antenas came out and broke easily. and I try to upgrade it from v2,2 to v 4.1.1 and the device stop working wireless.let only wire conection available .I contact linksys and told me that the divece garranty is expire. and they can't help me to fix it. when I told them that I just purchase it from circuit city and they told me that I need to purchase a extended garranty wich is not fair (a rip off)I need to to purchase a extended garranty for nothing since friend of mine told later that the way to fix it from others version problems is to reset the (WRG router) for 30 secongs and it did work it came back to factory settings. now I done but the service at linksys is a frustration . now wireless for me is available.linksys service suck."
1,good for 6 months,"It was working well for 6 months then after that it stopped working , all lights keep glowing all the time and support are also unable to help.Very delicat router"
1,Product Support Will Cost you,"They charge $9.99 to determine if their product, while under warranty, is defective. Then they require the customer to pay return postage when replacing their defective router. Lastly, they promised to ship a replacement ethernet cable and after 6 phone calls to the other end of the earth did not deliver cable. Customer Service NOT"
4,Good router.,"Had a problem with the set up, but overall great product and very stable, needs a reboot for time to time..."
3,Home use computer's,"i been using this product past 7 years, but the sad thing is that Linksys Router does last only 2 years.After every 2 year's i do have to buy another router ! I'm not really satisfied with the qualityPlease improve the quality of your product!!But when it is in working condition, it works great only for 2 years!Thanks"
4,Works well.,"It works really well. I needed it for a large apartment and its range is sufficient, but it may prove to be an issue for larger expanses such as in a house. I also use it with a cable modem and it is pretty quick. The installation was simple and straightforward."
5,easy to set up,this product was a quick 15 minute job to set up and create a network . not a problem . Just follow the foremost instruction put the software into your computer FIRST and remove any old Linksy software even if for a different type of router.
4,not too shabby,"easy to set up, and has worked without a problem since i got it. not much more i can ask for. i have great signal strength anywhere in my house."
4,Working Great so far,"I've had this working now for about 5 days. Things are runnning smoothly so far. No signal dropouts, and the laptops work all over the house. The configuration interface is easy to use, and clear enough. I had some trouble at first configuing the router with my PPPoE DSL, but that was my fault for charging forward without understanding what I was doing. Then I found the reset button on the router, and all was well. Since then, it's been flawless. I'd give one more star, but we haven't seen what the future holds yet. I'm not worried about it though."
4,Works great,"I was hesitant to purchase this product. I read many different reviews from sites all over the web both good and bad about this product. I decided there was more positive reviews than bad and decided it was worth a try. I am really glad I bought this router. I have only had to reset the router once, which is lot better than my old Comcast router. It has great coverage and the speeds are fast. The installation was really easy and fast."
3,works good difficult to set up,"This is a fine router once you get it working. I got ours working ok with one computer but when I tried to add an additional computer, oh my. I lost track of how many times I had to call customer support. The customer support is very good if you can deal with people with accents.I'm hoping I never have to push that yellow Cisco Systems reset buttonbecause setting it up again would be a major stress."
1,"Unstable, unreliable, and incompatible! Stay with BEFW11S4","I sold my BEFW11S4 and bought this, thinking that I would upgrade my home network one piece at a time. This was a HUGE mistake! It only worked with 1 (out of 3) of my 802.11b PC cards, and the signal strength was worse than the BEFW11S4! It consistently dropped my broadband connection, giving me a new IP address every 2 minutes, and did not have ""Port Triggering"" or ""UPnP"" options available in the setup menus. I sent this thing back the very next day, and bought the BEFW11S4. It's good be back... Do not buy this until further revisions come out, especially if you're using 802.11b only. Just my $.02"
5,So Easy....,"My first experience with wireless, and it couldn't have been easier.I replaced a wired router with this and was up and running in under 5 minutes....couldn't have been easier if someone else had installed it for me...."
4,"When you figure it out, it works like a charm","Ultimately the product works great. However, to finally get the item to work, it takes great patience and time.The product does not come with a user guide - only a CD. The CD does not work properly, telling you that the computer is not connected when in fact it is. When you chose configuration settings and press the ""next"" button, it says that you haven't chosen those settings.After I finally set the thing up properly, and after NUMEROUS problems with encryption and recognition by my computer (for some reason XP would not recognize changed encryption settings), I got it to work; however, the wireless signal would drop every 4 minutes.At any rate, after fiddling for hours, I finally called tech support (which I should have done in the first place). They directed me to: www.linksys.com\easyI downloaded the program, installed it, and now the thing works like a charm. No problems whatsoever. End of story."
5,Awesome product.,"I love this Router. The range of the wireless extends pretty far, and I have not had a problem with the wireless connection thus far."
1,frustrating experience!,first the wireless connection broke down every day or so. after reading the manual i changed the frequency. that helped for a short while. but now the entire thing breaks down every 5 minutes. even the conventional router (non-wireless) does not work anymore. now i will have to deal with the company to get a new one... very frustrating and not recommended.
1,Linksys sells wireless routers that do not work!,"This was my third Linksys router and all three devices did not work. I owned the first 3 years ago. The latest two were this G model. I could not believe that two models in a row would be faulty, but sure enough they both were. I replaced the second Linksys router with a Belkin model today, and here I am minutes later writing this review. The pain created by Linksys is beyond belief. I even took my iBook to the Apple store convinced there was a problem with my laptop. The Mac was fine of course. No more Linksys for me!!"
1,Latest version does not work well,"I have owned 2 pervious versions of WRT54G's that worked well. At least until one of them died on me recently. I purchased another WRT54G to replace it, and got the new version 5. Without the firmware update, its an awful router. It's very slow in loading webpages. The firmware update provided by Linksys fixes most of the problems, but I still see problems loading certain webpages. And there is still a perceptible slow down in loading most pages.The new version 5 uses half the memory and a cheaper chip. It's not worth your time waiting for better firmware. As others have mentioned, this version does not allow you to load custom third party firmware.Save yourself the hassle and buy a different router."
2,Problems,"I bought this router a few months ago and have had a host of problems with it. First, it frequently drops the radio connection. This is apparently a common problem - I've seen quite a few people discussing it on various message boards. Second, the VPN pass-through just stopped working. The customer support people were not particularly helpful (I agree with an earlier post that the people at the call center in India are very difficult to understand), but they did arrange to have a new unit sent out to me. Overall, I wonder if a different brand would have been a better bet for me."
2,why the wireless on this router sux,"The wireless access always drops your connection. I tried experimenting with G only, B only, and mixed all to no improvement. I tried upgrading the firmware only to find no improvement. Its absolutly maddening to consistently lose your connection to your router ever 2 minutes at times. Other times are even worse, I have to connect to my neighbor because my wireless won't even acknowledge me. It will show full bars for signal strength and still no use.Another friend of mine had a similar experiences with this, went out and bought the most generic brand-X router, a motorola but I don't think he has wireless-G on it. He has no problem with a great stable connection now and I'm purple with jealousy."
2,Linksys wrt54g Should be recalled!,"I say that becasue on the box, it says it is backward compatible with 802.11b devices. It isn't, plain and simple. To get it to work with b devices, you need to download and install updated firmware. IMO, a product that doesn't do what the box says it does until you upgrade it, should be recalled. Also, this is a common complaint of users of this AP. It wasn't an isolated experience that just happened to me. Secondly, the range is about one quarter of what it was with the router/AP I had before this one. There may be ways to improve range, but I didn't buy this AP to spend time tweaking it. I was hoping it would work well out of the box. I was way wrong. On the upside, it has plenty of features, and I'm sure linksys will get it right eventually. I'd avoid this product though."
3,An expensive cheapo,"Pros: this router has a significant advantage over the others - it has a mini-Linux running inside, and the firmware source code is available under GPL.Cons: If you plan to use VPN, get a Netgear WGR614 instead."
1,Worst router ever,"Speed randomly drops 10 times from 1mb to 100kb, sometimes network is undetectable, customer support can only tell you how to reset it without any actual help."
1,Less than a year,"Lost internet within a couple of months, tech support got it back up. Then it lost it again passed warrenty so no help. Also interferes with cordless phone. Weak signal in small house (1600 square feet)with product in the middle."
5,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router,Product worked great. Set up was easy. Had my WPA secured wireless network setup within 20 minutes.
4,"Works well, but I had some trouble configuring it.",Had a nasty issue where I lost my DSL modem for a while. It functions as a netwrok router as well and thought I could disable that feature on my DSL modem and have the Wirless router give my modem an address. That didn't work so well and so I let them both be routers. Now it all seems to work fine.
1,Linksys security risk,"As a Wireless router, this product works fine. It actually performs quite well. It does have one major flaw. I happen to be upgrading routers (Wired to Wireless) and tried to move my security settings (I block numerous ports such as FTP and SMB and others as recommended by security organizations. I found that Linksys will only block TWO ports. In this age of trogans and scanners, I couldn't believe this, but Linksys support acknowledged this shortcoming."
4,wrt54gs,"When I oredered, I oredered the wrt54g but a misslabeled box eneded up giving me a wrt54gs(112.00 MSRP), to my suprise. I've had many linksys products before and as always its easy to get initial set up, but be ware. unless you know quite a bit about net working and terms it can be difficult for a new to wireless persont to get easyly confusted. its a great router for thoes who know what they are doing. But that being said, I would not recomened this router to someone who is just starting networking."
1,Brick in a Box,"I opened up my WRT54G and did everything by the book, following the instructions on the included CD-ROM to set it up (somewhat bizarrely, there's a text Quick Start guide included in Spanish, but not in English). Unfortunately, the Power light started flashing as soon as I plugged it in. I googled around and was told that that meant that the firmware was corrupted. Ok, no big - I can update a firmware. Unfortunately, though, the router won't even let me log into the 192.168.1.1 control panel, so I can't actually update the firmware. So essentially this thing is just a brick in a box."
1,Horrible!,"I owned this router for over a year and half and was never pleased with it. I don't even know how I dealt with it for that long. The wireless speed and range are horrible--Seemed like I had reverted to my old dial-up modem. The wireless connectivity was very poor, very slow speed, and unreliable. Also, Linksys tech support is horrible. I recently purchased a Belkin Wireless G Plus router and am 100% satisfied. I will never buy another Linksys product. Ever. I highly recommend Belkin routers."
2,VoIP phone does not work,I replaced my old Linksys router with the WRTG54G version 5 and my VoIP phone stopped working (one way audio). When I talked to the Linksys technical support they advised me to return it.
2,"Good product, very poor tech support","Used earlier model router will little trouble but when upgrading to thus model strange problems came up. Tech support was useless - hung up on me, ran me around in circles for an hour checking stuff that had no relation to problem, asked for old router model 3x, ended with no real solution.Asked a question in Tech Support chat area then called Tech Support to verify answer and received exactly the opposite answer.Linksys, your Tech Support needs help!"
1,DOESN'T WORK,"This product flat out doesn't work.The installation documentation isn't correct, the Linksys website isn't correct and Linksys Tech Support can't get the product to work. This is extremely frustrating because this product is highly rated.My network uses XP Pro in a peer-to-peer LAN (no domain, just a workgroup) with all current service packs installed. Linksys Tech Support says the router must be set to defaults and WEP (security) turned off to work! Using those settings, I can connect to the Internet but still can't access anything else on the LAN.Assuming I could get the router to work, would I really want to use a wireless LAN with no security?"
1,item does not work,The router does not work at all.Please never purchase anything from this seller.I feel as if I have been cheated by this seller.Avoid this seller.........
5,Seamless installation,"I bought this router to replace an older Linksys router that was working fine, but technologically out of date. I was concerned about the installation and problems I might encounter, but there were none. The new router had clear warnings to run the CD first before connecting the router, and I walked through all the steps (about five minutes max) and I was up and running. Great product, great price."
3,Not as good as expected,"Easy to setup, but needs to be reset from time to time. Getting a bit better after updating firmware manually."
1,"poor product, worse customer service","I'm on my second WRT54G as the first was replaced by Linksys following 6 tech support calls to reconfigure the router. It doesn't seem to keep the same IPV4 address day to day so I could never get to the internet through it. I had to pay the $10.00 to send it back (had to be priority with a tracking number or I'd be charged for the replacement). Unfortunately I've already called in twice for reconfiguring, spoken with the supervisor and her manager, and been sent back to tech support. I've ruled out problems with the modem, ISP, computer and my phone device and it seems my Linksys is the problem again. I've since been told to avoid the version 5 models as they have the worst reputation for consistency."
3,Sorta Satisfied,"Have both the WRT54G, version 1.0 and 1.1. When I upgraded the firmware of the Version 1.0 to firmware version 1.42.3 from 1.30.7 I lost the ability to disable the wireless function without a power reset. Was told that 1.42.3 was not for V1.1. That was the only version available for upgrade. Then was told by support to upgrade to v 1.43, which is not available to general public yet. Then told to go back to v 1.42.2 which did not cure the problem. Have found Tech support, which is outsourced to another country, unsatisfactory. They also do not answer emails. Have the same firmware problem with the V1.1 router."
5,AAAAAAA++++++,"Linksys has done it again! Great documentation - better than the doc for the last router I purchased from them. And this time the setup disk worked and everything got set up the first time, right out of the box. Outstanding product!"
2,Below average,The router works ok. The range and speed for what I bought it for far exceeds my needs. That said my needs are not great. The problem with this router seems to be when the modem goes down the router needs to be reset after it comes back up. This is no big deal unless you put it in a customers structured wiring closet and they are not technically savvy. More than that the customer expects the products that I install to work. I have installed many of these routers but no more. It seems after Version 3 of this router it has tanked. The other problem is that the card will see the router but will not lease an IP address. This requires a hard reset of the router. Overall I would say the router is annoying. Well so long Linksys it was nice while it lasted.
4,Great Wireless,"its a good buy, especially when u look at the prive the same router is avialable for at other places.. its better than netgear or the others.. i read somewhere it has something to do with 2 antennas...installing was very simple.. enabling mac addressing to restrict others may seem a little tough to the layman..another great thing i liked about the router was it was backward 802.11b compatible.lastly, and though not a good factor, it looks really nice... :)"
2,Model with less memory than its predecesors,This model has less memory than the previous models and its firmware can NOT be easily changed to one based in linux. If you want to change the firmware you are better off buying the WRT54GL.
3,Rude Customer Service Representative,"The wireless router I had seems to disconnect every 1 or 2 hours tops. It happens to 2 of my laptop so I figured there is something wrong with the router rather than my laptops. I called the number on the back of the box, twice. The first time I am quite sure the customer service representative hung up on me because I raised my voice. The second time I ask for the supervisor and ask for the reason why I was hung up. Same rude attitude. This is my very disappointing and unpleasant experience with linksys."
2,Setup problem,"The startup instructions CD doesn't work with Windows 7 (which is just about ALL new PCs).Very disappointing !!!It does include detailed printed instructions in Spanish, but not in English. How odd."
3,OK For Basic Users But Power Users Avoid,"If you're just looking for a simple 802.11bg router to use then this is fine. The Linksys software is fairly painless to setup and the router worked reliably once that was taken care of. If, however, you're looking for a customizable router then you're pretty much out of luck. The later revisions of this router were cost reduced and the ability to put on 3rd party FW like DD-WRT is limited to some cut-down versions with limited functionality. Further, the process for flashing the FW is pretty involved."
1,THIS IS A USED ITEM CARRIES NO WARRENTY,PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS SELLER HE / SHE IS SELLING USED OUT OF WARRENTY PRODUCT REPACKAGED AS NEW PRODUCT. i WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THIS IF I DID NOT NEED TO CALL LINKSYS FOR SOME TECH SUPPORT. AND THE SURPRISING THING IS THAT AMAZON IS FILLING THE ORDERS. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
2,I ordered one online and got on locally,"Neither came with an install disc for the driver.I also tried going to the site to download the driver and searched the web.It is all BS,please save yourself the trouble oh hours of frustration.If anyone has the disc/driver let me know."
4,Tricky to configure on the Macintosh,"Since I got the Linksys WRT54G wireless-G router configured, I've been completely satisfied with the performance and reliability of the product.I have to withhold the 5th star for the product, though, because the configurator didn't have a Macintosh version, only a Windows version. I checked the Linksys web site, but didn't see any downloadable code for the Mac there. Then I phoned customer support. I was connected to a knowledgeable, helpful fellow in Manila, who escorted me through a complex manual configuration. I couldn't have accomplished the configuration task myself using the Linksys customer documentation.The customer support person had me name my network with a word in the Tagalog language, and wouldn't tell me what it meant. I had a Tagalog speaking friend translate the word for me later, and the translation was completely innocuous. I wonder what was the big secret!"
4,not too bad,"it is good and it really works. but you should setup it several times to get the pin and make the wireless protected. seems not work very well with the MS Vista system, but it is okay. sometimes it does not work very well and you should restart it.though some problems sometimes, it is good to use."
2,nothing but problems since incept,"used a linksys wireless g for a few years and found its performance acceptable. It died prematurely, but i bought another a few months ago to replace it. It has not worked out. The security with remote computers is much more difficult to set up and maintain than the previous version of the same router. They are hard to set up (you have to use lengthy codes) and the signal is intermittent. This means the network for all your users goes out and gets you in the doghouse with the users on your network. I've had to reset the router fairly often and the connection speeds are consistently slower than the previous version of the router. I am buying another brand and will not miss this product."
5,GREAT !!!,"everytime i order something from you & it comes from J&R music world it's here the next day and i never have had even one problem .......they are a great asset to amazon, don't stop using them !!"
5,CISCO makes the best,"I recieved the router in days, hooked it up, and has been working wonderfully ever since. No problems. I love it."
1,Don't buy version 5.0!!!!,"This version is a garbage. Don't buy!!! I guarantee you will regret with it. I really regret that I bought into its high rating and didn't spend time reading the newest reviews about version 5.0. When you think everything is settled and enjoy surfing net, shoot, the router gets off. How can they name this model the same?! It is definitely a cheat.UPDATE: (11/25/05) I got a version 4.0 from compusa today. The ones in CC and BB are all version 5.0. (They are for Milford, CT though; your local stores may be different)"
3,Meh,"Works fine. We've had some problems since installation, but I'm 98 percent certain they've been issues with our ISP, not with the router itself. My only complaint would be that this showed up at our door dirty. The packaging was all fine and secure, but I opened it up and it was seriously dirty -- caked in dirt. It wasn't labeled as refurbished, and I'll be ticked if I paid the price I did for something used. But at the end of the day it does the job, so that's what really matters."
4,Linksys WRT54G wireless router,I purchased my third Linksys wRT54G wireless router. They seem to work well for about two years and then become defective and need to be replaced.
1,Save your money!,"When used in the wireless security mode, you will OFTEN get disconnected by the router. So, unless you want an unsecured wireless network, do not buy this. Disconnects Xbox, laptops, DirecTV console and everything else in our house. Have owned for over a year. Even disconnects Linksys Wireless-G Gaming console at random..."
1,Short Lifespan... Doesn't play well with Mac,"It's Linksys and it works out of the box like it should - IF you use a PC! With Macs, you better be able to do some typing and configure it thru the browser - 192.168.1.1 but it's not bad if you have some technical background. You don't need to be able to write code, just understand the basics of what you're setting up and WRT54G will come to life and fly like a bird.A bird with a short lifespan...This is my 3rd Linksys WRT54G Wiireless Router. They, like all Linksys products, seem to have a short lifespan after which Cisco/Linksys Technical Support will declare it ""Bricked"" and direct you to replace it or use it as a plastic boat anchor.Needless to say, I'm going to try Netgear now."
2,Fair Product; Deplorable Service!,"Wireless router failed after 2 months of use. Linksys received my product for warranty exchange in early December 2006. It's now mid-March 2007 and they still haven't replaced it. I've made multiple phone calls and emails to Customer Service. Reps are very polite, but promises are empty. There's been no action, no follow-through, and no resolution. You have to start over each time you contact them. Linksys Customer Service is a big black hole."
1,Wireless G less,"I have been very unhappy with the product. The distance I get is maybe 15 feet from the access point in spite of every effort to move everything around, change channels, stand on my head...The range worked for maybe a week. I live in a small 3 bedroom but forget getting any signal outside the office. There needs to be some sort of booster, otherwise this was a waste of money. I now use [a wireless interent service] when I leave the office with the laptop."
5,Secure Wireless,"Replaced my 4 port (no wireless) Linksys router with this one. Wired works just the same and I was able to get wireless set up securely in under ten minites. Remember to change the SSID name and set it non broadcast, enable WEP etc. etc."
4,Wireless Router,"The router has,so far, perform flawlessly. In an attempt to make installation idiot proof, the installation CD provides no explanations while guiding you through the screens. It was only on the second attempt that I found the option to display the full user guide. After that, I was able to complete the installation process."
2,Early versions beware,"Just sent WRT54G, ver. 1.2 back to Linksys under RMA. It is almost cheeper to throw the unit away. Linksys tech. support marginal at best. Would never have gotten it to work without BellSouth tech. support. Each time they got it working it crashed within a week or so. I finally got someone at Linksys that spoke English and she authorized RMA after a few simple test. Now I am out $10.00 return postage for a unit I that I could buy locally for $69.00 with rebate. Hopefully the replacement unit will be ver. 2.**, if not it goes into the trash."
2,Bad User Interface,"The router was easy to set up and use, but I quickly found that the interface provided too few options. One key feature missing from this router is port triggering, making it impossible to play certain games online. I ended up selling it to someone else and getting a D-Link."
1,Isn't Linksys a quality brand?,"Got my WRT54G v7 a month ago to replace an older model. Been having nothing but trouble since, with my connection dropping as many as ten times a day for no apparent reasons, and I have to physically reset the router because of DNS problems. Firmware is up to date and the router's properly configured. C'mon, my PC is just about six meters from the router!A lot of people are having the same problem, apparently, and now I really wish I had bothered reading up some reviews before investing in this piece of junk. Shucks, it hardly looks great even as an expensive paperweight...."
1,TOTAL JUNK,The first Linksys (bought over a year ago....works fine) --- Ive bought two more of these in the last 30 days and both have failed after a couple of weeks -- will not reconnect to the internet - will not reset - will not do anything except a huge headache -- I've now returned 2 and will buy from a diffent company on the next one
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased the Linksys WRT54G router a couple years ago. There is no way i have found to remove old computers once connected to the router. I wanted to remove a roommate that had moved out and an old work computer - pretty minor, but i dont understand why this isnt a feature. A much more important concern; I use my router for streaming Netflix to my tv (wireless) and for gaming on my computer (ethernet cable). I have run into frequent problems with my router locking up during my gaming. I have also run into streaming issues with wireless connects to my TV. The tv issues have been both quality and losing connection. When i reset my router and computer the problems corrected. Rebooting my computer alone does not fix any of these problems. Time for me to buy a real router. If you dont like to reset your router every week, dont purchase this one!"
1,Worst experience ever with Linksys,"The version 5 that sells Amazon does not work with VOIP, a lot of problems out there (this is the version 5).Linksys Customer Service just says that they are not aware and they are useless.Go away from this version! Try to buy a v4 from another store checking the seril number (the v5 is CFDB). You need to go to a regular store to check this."
2,Works well by itself. Breaks Internet VOIP phone,"I had version 1 of this router for over two years. Worked great untill it just seized. I got another one, which happened to be the latest version 5. It works fine, but my VOIP SunRocket phone stopped working. Linksys confirmed that the problem is with the router.It does not run Linux anymore, so there are no firmware alternatives."
4,good router,Wireless works great. I installed the new firmware and have not had any problems that I see so many complaints about. One time the internet stopped working and I had to renew/release the DHCP on the router. Havent had any other problems at all. I recommend it.
2,COMPUSA warned me I'd need tech support..,"I had to pay $150.00 to have the tech guy come over and do his thang. Otherwise, be a wiz kid before you think about installing this yourself. It works though."
2,"Decent product, lousy support","The router worked fine until Linksys shipped a buggy firmware update which prevented Macs from using the router. They shipped a fix somewhat later but the firmware update left my router in an unusable state. I reported the problem to Linksys: two weeks, a buggy website and several unanswered emails later I finally received an RMA - and found out that Linksys expects me to pay for shipping to fix their problem."
1,Not worth the trouble,"I bought a WRT54G because I got a good price (...). I didn't realize until after I opened the box that had a new WRT54G v5. As with others, I had nothing but trouble. It worked for about a week and then all of the wired and wireless computers lost their connections and could not access the Internet. A reboot of the router did not fix the problem and I had to switch back to my old router.I tried again a few days later and it sort of worked for about a week. There were times when web browsers would get lots of timeouts and then it would work again. I finally gave up when I tried to add a wireless bridge to the network and all of the other devices lost their connections.At that point I gave up on the WRT54G. I am now using a WAP54G access point and a BEFSR41 switch/router and that is working just fine."
1,Beware of v5,"When buying this router, make sure you're aware of which version you're buying. The v5 version contains new firmware, and cannot be run with third-party firmware like the previous versions. The firmware in v5 is brand new and awful, as of 1/28/06. I upgraded my recently purchased v5 router to the latest firmware, and it still was terrible. Dropped wireless connection every five minutes or less to both B and G adapters. I'm taking it back and going with the Belkin pre-N router. Linksys used to be good, but made a horrible mistake with the WRT54G v5."
3,Bah,"So it's easy to hook up and install and it works great and it's price is good, BUTI literally got 5 in a row that didn't work. Until finally i got one that did. I wasn't installing it wrong either; i phoned them up and I was pissed. It works now, but the past ones, that was hell.The quality is... horrible.1/5 chance that one will work for me.. 1/1 should work.New Edit: I really hate this now. At least 4 times a week I have to reconfigure it. Why? I don't know, but it sure is REALLY pissing me off...!"
1,WRT54G v5... stay away...,"This is the worst wireless router I have ever seen. I have set up wireless routers since their inception from all almost all manufacturers and I have had the most issues with Linksys. I have recently purchased a WRT54G v5 for a family member but decided to upgrade my ""B"" network at home to the ""G"" standard with this product. I have had nothing but issues, LAN portion and WAN portions work fine, but the wireless just stops working after approx 10 min and the only way to rectify is by unplugging the router for 10-15 seconds. I am so fed up I could smash this thing with a hammer. If you value your health you will NOT purchase this product!!"
2,"Decent Product, Terrible Tech Support and Customer Service","I have been using the Linksys wireless router and access card for about three months. The wireless connection is sometimes not stable (i.e., sometimes does not connect even when it recognizes an available wireless network). I called tech support to fix the problem. It was one of the worst tech support I have ever encountered (based in Phillipines). I called three times, each time wait time exceeded 30 minutes. All three did not seem to know what they were doing - made me change some random settings (without any explanation) which did not make any difference to my connection. Their goal was to try to get me off the phone as soon as possible. All three promised that they will e-mail me an updated firmware as the latest version available on Linksys web-site still has bugs. I never received any of their e-mails. I have finally sent in for a warranty exchange. Hope it works."
5,Terrific!,"My son bought this so he use his laptop at home and utilize the wireless capability. The Linksys has performed beautifully and their Customer service guys were so helpful, quick and terrific!"
1,Mac Users: avoide this like the plague,"I bought this because it's roughly 1/2 the price of Airport. Spend the extra $ and go w/the Airport--I've spent days on the phone w/linksys tech support, Mac support, and fussing for hours, and I still can't get a wireless connection from my laptop to the router. Linksys apparently does work with Mac, but the company does not recognize Mac equipment in its documentation or tech help."
2,no-return policy,"LinkSys has a no return policy, something pretty strange for an electronics company. I bought a lemon and they offered to replace it...the replacement didn't work either. Hours of diagnostics on the phone, router didn't have much range past a few feet in an apartment building. Maybe it works better in a house. You must pay for shipping when it's replaced, and must pay to return the lemon replacement. When you run out of patience, you are stuck with a non-working router. Belkin is better and has a 30-day return policy. I would never buy another LinkSys."
3,Not for serious networking.,"I recently retired my WRT54G and replaced it with another brand. That was definitely a step up. With various incompatibilities in certain security modes (it won't talk to a PSP in WPA/TKIP mode - the replacement router has no problem), and with a long-standing annoying bug that necessitated regular reboots with certain usage patterns, this router is OK for it's price, but there are better choices for serious network users."
1,Not Recommended,I do not recommend the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router because the enclosed software was buggy and did not establish the correct settings for a secure wireless connection. The Secure Easy Setup feature is a mystery to me as I could not seem to get that to work either. I tried two different Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Routers with the same experience and returned them both. In the end I went with a Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Router which works just fine without the headaches.
1,Not working out of the box.,I tried 2 of this one. Followed all the setup procedures but cannot detect my DSL internet (Verizon). The ones I got is version 8.2. I will try the WRT54GL since it has great reviews.
2,"SLOOOOOW, Range not good",The router is very reliable but the surfing is too slow when other clients are on the network. The range is also not good. I only get 3 or 4 bars on the meter and the router is only 20 feet away. Also the plastic case is warped. The 4 legs will not rest on the table at the same time. I have a version 6 router. I would avoid this and try a version 8 or a different model
2,Good product but TERRIBLE Tech Support,Product worked just fine for 2 yrs and then one fine day the wireless gave out (wired router function still worked). Tried to call tech support - was on hold for 2.5hrs before giving up. They do not tell wait times during hold and I did not want to wait to infinity. Tried live tech chat and got no response for over 1hr. Gave up.This company had great support about a yr+ back. I remember taking to svc reps in under 10mins during 1st year of use. Guess they don't think people care about support - wrong!
2,Cannot count on for a reliable data transfer,"The connection would drop for less than half a second, but just long enough to cause the webpage I would be trying to view to not appear. I also didn't like that in the firewall settings I could only allow ports to connect to certain IP addresses. Most routers I have used let you forward the ports to all the computers behind it.Aside from those two things it was a good router. I got good WIFI range and the interface for configuration was very intuitive. The manuals outlined everything a user would need to do. I just couldn't stand having to reload a page when the router would timeout."
1,ROUTE THIS!,Wasted my time trying to make this work -After a number of dropped and placed calls to India and 5 hours later -this product SUCKS!
1,They failed to mention....,"I bought this product to link LAN segments together wirelesly. What they fail to mention in the product description (but clear in the product manual) is that you can only do this with other WAP54G products. Since my primary wireless router is D-Link, it will not work with it, and I have to buy a 2nd WAP54G to make it work."
3,LINKSYS WRT54G,I got my order in about a week time.The first thing i did was opened the box and ran the cd as recommended.It took me quite a while to get it running. Every time i tried to connect to the internet trough the router it was not working. I soon realised that i had forgot my laptop computer on upstairs.It was connecting to my laptop and not my pc.I switched the laptop off and tried again. It took me about five minutes to set it up after that.It has been on since that and has not given me any trouble since that.This ia a great product.
3,Needs Dictionary Compatibility,"I was elated when I found this available for my kindle, then extremely disappointed when my Latin dictionary on my kindle (which worked with everything else I had read) did not work for this book. Since I (and I doubt anyone, for that matter), do not have the functioning vocabulary of Virgil, a dictionary is crucial. I'm very disappointed."
2,Be aware this is plastic.,It looks like chrome metal but it is plastic. The quality is really poor but I guess it looks good. Someone already made fun of me for it. Wasn't too happy about that.
4,Understanding Nutrition,"I am really enjoying this book. It is a little deep for me but I knew that when I ordered it. It is more like a test book than an entertaining read. It is 10 years old so a lot of the information is a little dated, again I knew that, I was just looking for the basics of nutrition. I am learning so much!"
4,alt.western,"i first heard these two on samantha murphy's SMtv internet pod cast and immediately had to go to amazon to buy the city. i real mix of tradition western swing sounds with gritty lyrics. not to say lynda's voice is anything but smooth as silk. take a leep and pick this cd up, i don't think you will be sorry."
3,"Flash guitar, not a lot else","I am a firm believer in the potential of music like this. Independent minded folks taking roots music to a personal place and doing it with integrity. In this case I was disappointed. The guitar playing, while very impressive, is not that unique or far-reaching. The vocals just left me cold. I seem to be in the minority on this one from reading the other reviews, but she doesn't communicate much to me. Other than the guitarist's chops nothing in this music stands out from the pack for me. Oh...I really like the name!"
4,The perfect item for scale modelers,I was quite surprised when I opened the package. Inside was two complete stands and plenty of spring clips to hold just about any 1/24 and 1/25 body firmly in place while spray painting. These eliminate the need for bending coat hangers or spraying on top of spray cans. I haven't used mine yet but I will now feel confident that the body wont fall off the stand during or after painting. A great little product that perfectly filled a need.
2,Its alright,"This gun is an alright gun. I thought it was pretty cool until it jammed. i got it undone and it worked a lot better. This is a good sidearm and good for beginners. Overall i was really suprised with the range, but jams real easily. I recommend this gun to all beginners and people who want to buy a really cheap gun."
1,Dubya revealed,"Please, folks - if you think this guy is a freaking genius I've got some swamp down here in Florida I'd love to sell you. If you're not outraged you're not paying attention."
1,3 out of 4 are quality control failures,"My other half liked the idea of these martini glasses, so I went ahead and ordered a set of two. One of the bowls had a very large bubble in it, which meant a weak point that is likely to break. One of the glass had a chip in the rim that could cut your lip.I emailed CSN, and the really nice person sent a replacement set, even though only one glass was damaged.The new set had more bubbles in the glass and little pieces of glass inside the glass? Remember wood shop, when you sanded a piece of wood, and had little bits of wood everywhere until you blew and wiped it off? Imagine that, only it's glass, and you can't wipe it away, and it's in something you're supposed to drink out of.None of the damage was from shipping - the boxes and styrofoam packaging were all fine. These just shouldn't have gotten past quality control at the factory."
3,Martini Chiller set,"I was relieved that this arrived as a set of 2 glasses plus chiller bases as the description is not that clear. I was not happy that the stemless glasses will not stand alone, but MUST be placed in the chiller bases. If you are looking for a chiller set that allows the glasses to be used separately, don't buy this. It isn't a real big deal for me, but does mean I have to have other martini glasses, too, if I don't want to mess with carrying around a base and a glass. The glass is decent quality but a little on the thin side - would prefer they were a bit heavier. One of the chillers arrived with a piece broken! So I'm in process of exchangin it as I still like them. With all that said, this is a pretty set to use and to look at."
5,Best martini glass - EVER!,I bought two of these glasses a while back - LOVE LOVE LOVE them! Ice in the bottom portion - your drink in the top - it keeps your drink very cold without getting watered down. Highly recommend them for people who like cold drinks - not must martinis.
3,SIM Review,"This book was recommended by a particular course of studies that I am currently doing in information systems, thus far I am finding the book really seems geared to someone who has some experience in this subject matter. As I continue to study I am hoping that it will improve and I will gather the relevant information necessary to improve my lack of knowledge and poise my learning towards actual application. It would have helped also if there were review questions at the end of each chapter, but I guess that is not what the book was written for."
1,"OUTRAGEOUS ""shipping"" fee",Is there no option to overnight it with delivery in person upon a pillow surrounded by an armed escort?
2,An Introduction to Measuration and Calibration,"This book could have its' title changed to ""An Introduction to Dimensional Instruments"". It deals mainly with dimensional tools and has very little information about calibration. I bought this book for the calibration information and found nothing of use. This would be an excellent title for someone who wanted to know the tools used in a dimensional lab, and information they report."
3,Nice CD for sleeping,"I am NOT a michael ball fan. In fact, i find him to be overly self-indulging, and attempts to much to be a male Barbra Streisand. However, in this CD, it is nice to find out that he selected songs that would DEFINITELY fail, like Time in a Bottle. On some parts, Michael Ball could not hide from his over-acting style of singing-""acting"". His use of his low voice register saved the recording. I just hope, that he minimizes his acting by 50%. This would definitely improve the quality of his recording. From this cd, i hope he would try to be a little subtle and sublime."
3,A so so book,"Plenty of pictures, but I doubt about the idea when the author thought punk movement is more important than Dada and surrealism. Since I am an art student, I respect all the greats, I would not jump to a conclusion like that, although punk is definitely my favorite."
5,works mahvelous,"I've never had Netgear equipment fail. Small and compact, reliable but not pricey, and in a 6-port size. Most hubs come in 4 or 8+. Durable metal also, instead of cheap plastic like other brands."
1,Can i connect my BNC-cable?,"I would like to know or i can connect this HUB to my BNC (or Coax in Dutch) Network. Can somebody help me?Greetings,"
4,FUN,"SO MUCH FUN IN ONE LITTLE BOX!!! MY FAMILY IS PASSING THIS FIRST SEASON AROUND EVEN AS WE SPEAK! WE ALL LOVE THE CHARACTERS, AMAZING, BRILLIANT CASTING."
4,The Human Experience,"I love this series! Have really enjoyed going back to watch the entire series on DVD. MY only problem with this - why I didn't give it 5 stars - is that the episode arrangement on the discs is not chronological. Example : on disc 1, the final episode in sequence should actually have been the second or third with regard to character development of both Tommy and Dick, and Dick and Mary's relationships. I elected to watch episodes individually, instead of selecting 'play all'. Wondering if this might make a difference, but doubt it.Otherwise, the comedic timing of all the cast, as well as the excellent stories, make this show timeless and extremely enjoyable entertainment. Highly recommend it!!!"
2,Carsey-Werner holds the rights to the unedited versions. Tell them to give us the original episodes!,"Here is Anchor Bay Entertainment's response:The issue that exists is the originally aired episodes vs. syndicated episodes. We were only permitted to distribute the syndicated version of the series, which is what is on the DVD. Carsey-Werner (the licensor of the series) maintains the rights to the originally aired broadcast & it is their decision whether or not those will ever be released. If we are ever able to secure these rights from them, we will certainly do so.I've also contacted Jim Kraus President, Domestic Television Distribution at Carsey-Werner to let him know we want the unedited versions and although we love the show, we will not be buying this edited version.(Especially when it sounds like the edits in episode one were made to appease some narrowminded ignorant fundamentalists who don't want women to learn about their own health/bodies!)"
1,Edited?!,"Say it ain't so! There is absolutely no excuse for releasing an edited version of these episodes, since all of the original elements exist. I'll stay with my homemade VHS recordings of this, and encourage everyone to boycott these so-called ""complete seasons"" if they aren't really complete."
3,"Nice price on this series, but lacking subtitles","This is a nice series to watch all over again, but this particular version of Season 1 was missing subtitles in any language. When I press the subtitles button, it comes up with no selectable subtitles. The DVD menu also lacks a setting to enable subtitles; it only lets me play all episodes, select a particular episode, or view the extras on the DVDs."
3,Good timing,The service was great and I got the package with plenty of time to spare before Christmas. The only problem was that the DVD was not attatched to the case and was floating around getting scratched. but otherwise everything was great.
3,wish they were really full length - error in episode guide,"I won't belabor what's already been said: if they're not ""full length"" episodes, they shouldn't be advertised as such.But beyond that: The enclosed booklet describes the episode called ""Father Knows Dick"" thusly:Tommy claims Dick is ""pudding whipped"" because he does everything Dr. Albright tells him to. Sally, Harry and Nina agree. In an effort to appear more manly, Dick rebelliously skips Mary's party in favor of a raunchy bachelor party. also Harry, Sally and Tommy engage in a Monopoly game that gets more and more aggressive as the stakes increase.Sounds funny, but unfortunately NONE of that happens in ""Father Knows Dick!"" Actually, Dick decides to be a father to Harry (who says he lacks a purpose.) In this episode Harry learns that he has a communicator implanted in his head. Sally meets the mother of Mr. Randall (Tommy's teacher and Sally's boyfriend) and ends up in a rather ridiculous fist fight with her."
1,"Edited versions, muddy visuals","This was one of my favorite shows back in the day. But these are the edited (as in syndication) episodes.AND the video looks terrible, muddy, and grainy on modern TV sets.Avoid at all costs."
2,Full Broadcast Edits but at a terible cost,This two disk set from Mill Creek does contain the full uncut episodes but they put 10 of them on each disk and the picture quality is VERY degraded. The price is right though.
3,"If only Closed Captioning worked, it would be wonderful","The DVDs are great, containing the whole first season as described.However, the ""Closed captioned"" claim is totally false.Sigh. The price was right, so I'll forgive them,I guess, but it made me sad."
3,Love the show but not the discs.,"Great show but I can't play at least four maybe five episodes due to scratches on the discs, dissapointed prob won't buy used discs again."
2,Disappointed,"The dvd's were okay but the box was not in an okay state when it arrived. I've purchased a lot through Amazon and I have never experienced this. It,s a shame when it is for a gift. I don't think enough care was taken when posting to protect the product as in using bubble wrap. I will not use this seller again if I can help it."
2,clean and an ACTOR,This is a good tv show with a REAL actor. John Lithcow who plays the dad is a theater trained actor and it shows!! Very funy and not dirty. If you want to watch a show that has people degrade themselves with sex jokes watch Will and GRACE or E Show! Third Rock is not for you!!!!
3,not too soft,"I am not a picky person with toothbrushes, but the reason this toothpaste dissapointed me was that I expected it to be soft, as the name says. But its just like a regular toothbrush, not as soft as I wanted. I got a soft toothbrush of another brand and was satisfied with that. The good thing about this toothbrush is that its bristles do not wear out pretty fast, they remain intact for a long time. The size is good too, its just that I expected it to be softer."
5,Great product,"didn't feel like going out to the store so i bought this online, and what can i say, it's a regular toothbrush. was packaged well, and works well, and wasn't over priced."
3,Just Alright,"Well, it's a toothbrush, so it's not like you can really go wrong with it, but it certainly wasn't my favorite.Pro:REALLY CHEAP!Con:Too skinny! I feel like a giant having this in my hands. And the brush itself is also skinny, and I feel like it doesn't cover my teeth completely, which means I have to brush twice as long to go over the top and bottom of the tooth since the brush doesn't reach the entire tooth."
2,Get what you pay for,I was overall not happy with this toothbrush. I know its cheap but I found much better toothbrushes from my local drugstore. Would pass on this.
3,small head,"very small head on this tooth brush. Would have liked a full head instead of a small oval head. Otherwise, great. Thanks"
2,Over priced,At Over 3.50 what a waste. I should have bought it at WGs for 99 cents it would have been better
2,Not soft,"I bought these expecting a soft head, but it was rather hard and I really don't like them. It also has a large head (as advertised)."
2,Not soft enough,"I wanted a soft toothbrush. This one would be medium by my standards. I guess there are no official standards, maybe there should be."
5,Pleasing,Ordered this because I forgot to bring one to college. Everybody made fun of me but it was a great purchase. I didn't even have to move and I got a toothbrush. Life is good.
2,Beware the Tongue Scrubber,"The product I received had irritating grooves along the brush face opposite the bristles. This caused a nasty canker sore to develop on the inside of my lower lip. If you think you would be sensitive in this area then this brush will rub you wrong way. Due to Amazon's inept product descriptions and inaccurate low-resolution graphics, I've resorted to buying toothbrushes the old-fashioned way at the grocery store."
3,Review,"This book is about globalization as being a process that is as much a part of nature as evolution is. It asserts that culture is a type of 'living thing' that can grow, evolve, spread and even compete with other cultures. Although not much scientific evidence is provided to supplant the assertions made, I still found it to be interesting read."
5,Fabulous CD,"In their CD, Anne and Mark exhibit their engaging musical range, humor and considerable talent. I've heard them in person and so it's great to be able to re-live some of their charm and magic by listening to their CD. A great value."
1,...workout? are you kidding me?,"I was extremely excited after reading the reviews and receiving my DVD. I thought I had found a ""beginning"" workout to ease me back into ""working out"" after spinal fusion surgery. What a disappointment. The most difficult part of this so called ""workout"" is opening the dvd container. It is a ridiculous excuse for exercise and a TOTAL waste of money. If ANYONE is thinking of buying a copy of this farce, please feel free to email me and i will be more than happy to send you my copy just to get it out of my house. The creators of this debacle should be ashamed! absolutely AWFUL!"
2,Dreams Found and Deferred,"A man, a woman and two failed relationships. In ""The Meeting Place"" Sean Foley gets a chance to fulfil his dream when he leaves a job he hates. After Foley is told by his boss that he must cut his staff by 50 percent. Foley gives his recommendations for the cut, then walks out to start a new life with co-worker and companion, Maria Pulaski. Sean and Maria soon find that fulfilling a dream is much harder than chasing it. As they try to forget their failed marriages and embark on a journey of building a business, a life and blending two families; obstacles and roadblocks appear at every turn. One man will try to destroy their dream at any cost.The storyline in ""The Meeting Place"" is good, however, the short abrupt sentences take away from an interesting story.Vannie(~.~)Vannie RyanesEditor, Work & Family at Bellaonline"
3,Some wonderful playing...,"... but not wonderful teaching. I know this is blasphemy to many people, but I've been playing music for over 40 years and teaching for over 20 years. As a teaching video, it lacks. Yes, it provides you with the materials and you can work them out, of course. But as far as teaching the underlying concepts behind what is being played? Very poorly presented.Well, not everyone can teach, even if they are one of the best players out there today. Eric Johnson is brilliant, but as a teacher he should have thought through how to present his material a little more.It will help you, sure. But you're really going to have to work at it to get it all figured out. And a teacher will be able to help you with the underlying foundations behind what is happening musically because you really won't understand that stuff unless you really understand theory."
3,A Great Resource--in Reference Style,"Ethel Merman: A Bio-Bibliography is an excellent resource for the acquainted fan--one whose is familiar with all of Ethel's works and her personal style. However, it is NOT a book for beginners. It is written primarily in reference style (i.e., B01, B02, D32, etc.). The book is an excellent source of information, but it is in no way any form of pleasure reading. Those interested in purchasing this book should be sure they do not wish to view any pictures of Merman (there is only one), nor do they wish to read more than three pages of prose. However, the book is nonetheless a substantial REFERENCE resource. I would be happy to correspond further with any interested parties at jbradleyrogers@hotmail.com"
5,nice horseshoe set,Bought this set to replace a cheaper set of iron shoes that didn't last a full day before a shoe split in half. The shoes are well balanced and the shape made for more ringers in my opinion. Would definitely recommend the set to anybody looking for a nice upgrade from the cheaper iron sets common in the big box stores.
3,Short Stakes,"Yesterday was Memorial Day, and the horseshoe pit got broke-in. My friends and I were very pleased with this set. I have only one complaint: the stakes. In my opinion, they should have been about a foot longer. The stakes measure 23"", 14"" of which is supposed to be above ground. My pits are 6"" deep, so that left me only 3"" to bury. I ended up having to buy some wood (4"" x 4""), some rebar and an 11/16"" drill bit. I cut the wood into two one-foot pieces. On the bottom I drilled two 3/8"" holes half way through and hammered the rebar (3/8"" x 1') into them. After digging a out a place to anchor and bury the wood, I drilled an 11/16"" hole in which to place the stake. That seems to have worked out pretty well, but it would have been so much easier if the stakes would have been about a foot longer so I cold have just hammered them directly into the ground."
5,Great horseshoe set for the money!,"Bought this set for a party we had. Quality was better than expected, and it was played constantly be people all day and all evening. Since the party two couples have asked to borrow it. Very pleased."
5,Heavy but durable and fun!,"Purchased 3 weeks ago to bring down to the family in Costa Rica and the only downside was the weight, not the most comfortable thing to have on you when traveling, yet it pays off once you are playing with it. We played when it rained, when it was scorching hot, when it was super humid! I must mention that there were terrible throwers that sent the horseshoes flying towards a huge pile of rocks and the damage was minimal. It would have been nice if the manufacturer would have sold it with a carrying case but for the price I think it is very well worth it, you get the feel and strength of a professional set and the satisfaction that this is a game that will stay in your family for long after you are gone. It's a great trade-off!"
4,Get out the towels and patience,"The toy is thankfully easy to put together. Many of these sets have tiny pieces and intricate assemblies. THis one took ""only"" about 5 minutes to assemble.The only thing really really bad about it is the soap dispense which is so pathetically tiny it only holds about 2 squirts of water then you have to refill. It also has a tiny hole and is hard for even the adults to refill. The rinse dispenser is a little bigger and holds maybe 10 squirts. But thank goodness, the opening is large and our 4 year old can refill this one.Don't believe any implication on this box about this toy being ""little or no mess"". Water gets everywhere and you need to have a towel underneath. If we can land a vehicle on Mars and remote-control it, you'd think we could design some method to have a reservoir and reuse the water in this thing. But no.For what it's worth, this toy is definitely the better of the two out there (the other being the Hot Wheels car wash)."
4,Buffy,If you are going to buy one should get all the characters that you enjoyed during the series. Still looking for Xander and Clem.
4,About the Druids,In this book the author tells us a lot about the Druids. The story plays in a village in Wales near a seaside resort that specializes in the healing practices of the Druids. I liked the story but it could have been told without the history lesson about the Druids.
4,Constable Evans series,"I found ""Evans to Betsy"" to be a good read. I read it in one day and really enjoyed the entertainment it provided. I have read the series and enjoy them all. Evan Evans is my favorite of all of the Rhys Bowen characters. She made the individuals and the village come alive."
2,NOT compatible with older hardware!,"Before buying this card, think about the laptop you're going to put it in. If it is a P3/800MHz or older machine, this card will probably NOT work. The reason is older laptops built to the PC97-99 laptop specs often used TI Cardbus PCMCIA controllers. Despite half-hearted attempts by Linksys to write a good TI driver, this card is INCOMPATIBLE with TI cardbus controllers! If you get it to work, it's a fluke. If you call tech support, they will tell you to return it and buy a different brand. Believe them. ;)"
4,"Good Reception, Funky Connection","I've had little to no problem with signal strength with this product. My router is in the front of the house, and I can still get a ""very good"" signal in the back, through 3 walls. The next test will be when I take it back to school on Monday, but I don't expect any problems.My only complaint is that sometimes the control panel will show me that the connection is working but I can't pull up the web. I've been going into Network Connections, disabling and then re-enabling the connection. This usually works, as I believe someone mentioned in a previous review. Not a big problem though, and I'd recommend this card."
3,0 star and 5 stars so it got 3 stars,"The CD-rom that comes with the 54G wireless card is outdated. You need to download the latest drivers, or have Linksys e-mail them to you. Otherwise, you'd get a prompt asking for the mprapi.dll file, which does not exist on 98SE. And it screws up the already screwy AOL.Even with the newest drivers, if you have 98SE and AOL 9.0, or 98SE and AOL 8.0, you may as well forget it. Keep yourself wired instead. So, it gets 0 stars.The 54G wireless card and the 54G router work well with AOL 9.0 if you are running XP Pro. With XP Pro, it gets 5 stars.Installation is not as easy as you'd think. Maybe I'm just dumb. Try asking for a tech on the escalation team if you keep running into problems."
5,Wonder Card,"An excellent product, gives amazing speed for net browsing. Also very easy to install. Great service from Amazon, the product was delivered to me much before the expected delivery date."
2,Limited range,I'm disappointed with the range of this device. It works fine in the same room as the router and in an adjoining space. It does not work throughout my house as I expected.
1,Disabled my CD drive on Sony r505g notebook,"This product appears to have been poorly tested and rushed out the door. The installation of the unsigned Xindows XP driver apparently interefered with the operation of my Sony VAIO r505GL docking station's CD-RW/DVD drive (it no longer reads data). Uninstallation of both drivers and reinstallation of the drive's driver resolves this issue. Additionally, the device was unable to achieve a connection with linksys's WAP11 802.11B access point with a Windows XP home system ( even after ensuring that Wireless zero service is enabled, and following the advice in other reviews in Linksys's Knowledgebase). I am also unable to connect to public hotspots with this device, though it works fine with the Linksys G router. IT is possible that I have defective hardware, but Linksys support has ben tremendously unresponsive to my numerous complaints regarding the device. In short, wait a few months or look to another vendor."
4,"Great product, minor glitch when installing on XP","I've been using Linksys networking products for the home for 2+ years now and feel they are good value for the $. Documentation has historically been poor but I think Linksys is attempting to correct that problem.For this new 802.11g network-interface card (or NIC) I installed it on my laptop with Windows XP. The install appeared to be OK but I later learned that the Linksys WLAN Monitor software/utility did not install as part of this process. I had to go back to the CD and install it, and then all was OK."
2,Won't Work with Compaq Laptop and Windows XP,I wrote aqnother review but I didn't see it up. After I finished I saw other reviews with this same problem. The laptop will not accpt the PC card for the wireless G network. From what I have seen it is incompatible with Windows XP and Linsys has sent this out unprepared.
2,Wireless G PC card and Compaq Laptop not compatible!,"I just tried the Linksys WPC54G and the Access Point on my Compaq 900 series laptop running Windows XP. The PCMCIA card causes the computer to run like a 386 machine when inserted while its on. If inserted when its off the computer is unable to load Windows and resets itself over and over. Linksys could not solve the problem nor could Compaq and Fry's where it was purchased so it was returned. Beware if you buy this for your Compaq laptop, make sure its returnable! Yes, I have tried another brand D-Link and it ran without difficulty, but its range and speed were poor so I wanted the speed of G but I'll have to wait for a fix or another brand."
1,It worked grreat intill it broke,It was easy to set up and worked great for a month and then it broke.I am not sure how to get a refund so it is gathering dust at this time.
1,Won't work with my new HP laptop,"After trying for hours and also calling linksys and waiting on hold forever, I was told there was nothing they could do for me and that my laptop was incompatible with this new g adapter card. Very disappointed."
1,Worst Adapter Ever,"I had a Linksys Wireless B access point that just quit working. Upgraded to Wireless G. Using Linksys WRT54G router and WPC54G card. I run a Dell Inspiron 8100. To date, I have been unable to get the WPC54G card to work. I tried downloading drivers, reinstall and uninstall nothing works. The support is not very good. Now, I am getting interference from a neighbor on the access point. Linksys says change channel which I have done. Still having problems. A huge disappointment"
1,Not ready for prime time,"During installation, when the box popped up saying this product was not certified to work on Windows XP, they weren't kidding. The drivers never finished installing, and I had to actually pull the battery out of my laptop twice to get the CD to stop spinning. With the card in the slot, my Windows booted into safe mode every time, and the computer's performance became very sluggish. Once I pulled out the card, everything seemed fine. Linksys' web site was of no help, as it had the same driver which came in the box. After wasting two hours of my life on this mess, I took it back to the store and re-installed my ""old"" 11b system. My advice: try again in a few months after someone else has debugged this garbage. I will say that the 54g router was a snap to set up, but without an equivalent card for my laptop, the router too had to go back to the store."
4,link,It works fine as long as I'm within 25 ft of the main computer. I thought it would work from a farther distance.
3,Cheap and durable but limited range,"The linksys Wireless PCMCIA Card is one of the cheapest you will find, but as with other things, you get what you pay for. I forgot this simple truth when I purchased this item, and I desrved what I got. The card fitted to my laptop works great in the same room with the wireless AP I use, but leave the room with the lap top and signal strength quickly downgrades.If all you want is a wireless system that lets you update files on your lap top without re-connecting cables all the time, then buy this card. It works. But if you want to use the Internet and access a home network seemlessly and wirelessly anywhere in your house, buy the Orinoco Silver or Gold PCMCIA card instead. It costs a bit more, but the range is easily double that of the linksys.By the way, the only differance between silver and gold is its encryption ability. If you don't care about encryption, save some money and go for the Orinoco silver card."
3,Nice PC Card for non-BEFW11S4,"I've seen nothing but praise about this card so far, bought one myself to use with my B Cable/Router BEFW11S4 only to talk to Linksys support for half an hour and come to the conclusion that its not going to work with my router and I should buy the B version. Its supposed to be backwards compatible with the B standard, but its been four days now and its going back tomarrow."
1,"Well, it hangs my XP Professional Notebook","I have a Dell Inspiron 4000 running XP Professional SP1 and while I did eventually get my new Wireless-G network up and running (with the LinkSys wireless-g router), I could not reboot my notebook with this card in it.XP would start the boot process, but hang. Only when I removed the card did XP continue with its boot process. So I figured I'd put the card back in after XP booted (seemed reasonable), but it 're-hung' XP all over again.Very disappointed in the quality of the drivers for XP Professional even tho' I get the XP warning about the driver not being WHQ 'certified'. Oh, and the LinkSys website had no updated drivers (and dead links to same) to help me either."
1,Not for Windows 98se,"Even though the box says this adapter will work with windows 98se, don't count on it. After 15+ hours of trying various fixes and having Linksys support tell me that it does not work with windows 98, I exchanged it for a Belkin adapter (Part # F5D7010). Inserted the Belkin setup CD, it did it's thing for about 10 minutes then said to install the card. It worked right off, and was able to detect wireless networks from nearly a block away. Definitely the choice for older windows laptops!"
2,No Vista support,"The adapter worked great on XP.I just upgraded to Vista. When the adapter stopped working, I called and found out from Linksys that it won't work with Vista, and there won't be any firmware written."
4,plug and play networking,"I have this card installed on two laptops. Basically, we turn on the machine and we have access to local LAN and high speed access to the Internet via a cable modem.There is nothing to making this card work besides installing the driver and starting to work. The best speed achieved so far is 54 MbS whilein the same room with the router, 48 MbS when located on a different level and two rooms down. Speed drops off when distance increase to over 100 feet and there are ubstructing walls, including an exteriior stucco wall that has signal eating chicken wire.However, multiple machines are hanging and banging on this technology without incident.The best thing: NO MORE CABLES!"
1,Couldn't make it work on WPA Wireless Network,"I have an older (2003 vintage) Vaio laptop with an XP operating system that I wanted to network with my home Linksys WPA ""G"" wireless network. Despite extensive consultation with Linksys techs, I could not get it to link into the network. So, I sent it back. By the way, I have a newer Gateway Vista laptop that is operating on the network just fine. I'm not sure whether the problem was with the network adapter or the older laptop, so I couldn't rate the product highly. The return was not worth it because of the restocking fee and shipping and handling. I netted back only a few bucks on my purchase as a result. It was a pretty frustrating and annoying experience."
2,Cisco-Linsys WPC54G,"Though it is listed for use in ME, I am not able to get a connection, even 16"" away from the signal.I wanted to add wifi to the laptop I carry on trips instead of the small screen on the phone. Even downloading from Cisco didn't help. It always hangs at aquire. Could be the laptop, could be there isn't any service for older OS's hard to say. Don't need the card with newer laptops, because they already have wireless connectivity installed.The seller I got it from packed it very well & it got here from across the country fastest of all the products i ordered that day."
1,Bad Install with Dell Inspiron 8000,"I echo a former review about problems this card with a Dell Inspiron computer. Had problems with the install~Couldn't open the card's utility feature after several attempts. Incidentally, I am using a Netgear MA521 card with a Linksys WRT54G router on another Dell Inspiron (5000)computer, and that seems to be working fine."
1,This is a joke,"If you are using Windows 98, dont even think of buying this product. It updates an existing dll file to an incompatible version, and applications such as Norton Internet Security become unusable. Their support web page is inaccesible, and their 800 support number disconnects you once you press the numbers that lead to that product's support area. Bizarre, to say the least."
3,Does not work in PowerBook G4,"I bought this card because I'd read it worked with Apple's Airport 3.1 (and later) software in machines like my 15"" PowerBook G4. Unfortunately it appears that something changed for the ver 2 variant of the WPC54G card, and it isn't recognized by Apple's software. I should note that Linksys does not claim that the card is Mac-compatible, so I don't fault them; I just want to alert other Mac owners who might be considering this card."
3,dififcult setup with Airport base,"Installation was easy on HP laptop running XP (Home), got immediate detection of signal from my Apple Airport Base Station (I have been successfully running Airport network with several machines in my house for more than a year). Although the Linksys Wireless-G was clearly talking to the Airport, it wasn't getting a correct IP or DNS via DHCP. I was saved by another poster here who wrote: ""Getting the 128 bit WEP configuration to work required asking a consultant for help. Apparently, you must enter the long security code versus the network access password. This obscure nuance was not obviously noted in the manual or on line documentation."" Reset the WEP password on the Airport, specified that in a control panel on the laptop and everything worked. Compared to installing a wireless card on a Mac, this was ridiculously difficult. But it now works. ***** for performance, great range and * for setup, which averages to *** rating overall."
1,Depends on Operating System,"Linksys is a very good company, however they are having a lot of problems with the software for this card, from what I hear the WPC54G works fine with XP, however with older operating systems such as Win 98 or Win Me you have a large chance of receiving installation errors. Like other users I have found support to be very unhelpful, they either don't know about the problems or refuse to acknowledge them. They will blame your operating system even thought they are having reports of problems from many users. Check out www.dslreports.com/forum for updates on problems. I'll be returning this one for another brand, its a shame what could be a great product is unuseable."
4,Notebook adapter,"I had no problems installing the adapter. However I'm still having issues for the computer with the adapter to recognize the internet. It finds the wireless connections, but after that it's stuck. I still have to research a bit more to figure the whole thing out."
5,Works Great!,"The internal wireless broke in my laptop. After installing this card, I was back in business within 5 minutes!"
3,missed networks,"i had to return it because it didn't pick up some wireless networks that my computer was already picking up! i was looking for better strength of connection, but it didn't work as well as my internal device... Bummer"
5,Exactly what we needed.,"My daughter broke the USB adapter we had so I ordered this unit. It is exactly what we needed and the ease of installation was extraordinary. Not being very tech savvy, this was almost plug-n-play for me."
5,Easy... works great,"Bought it a few months back and have had no problems. Took me all of about 20 minutes to be up and surfing. Great product, I recommend it."
1,crashes windows me,"bought this for my dad's dell inspiron notebook using the windows me platform and it just kept crashing the computer everytime we tried to install it. even when we exchanged it, the same thing happened. then we got the Netgear WG511T Super G 108 Mbps Wireless PC Card and it works perfectly!"
1,It never worked since day 1,"I bought the Linksys WPC54G Wireless-G Notebook Adapterand the NETGEAR WMB521NA 802.11b Wireless Kit for Notebooks. The Netgear kit (router and notebook adapter) works great, but the Linksys has never worked since the day I received it. I called Linksys support and still did not get it working."
2,difficult to set up,"We used this product on a Sony Vaio running Win2000. It was very difficult to set up and took several calls to lynksys support and several days out of our lives. Their support is good and I can see why, their products are hard to get working and without great support they would be lost.As it turns out this unit won't even run with the software that comes with it in our Vaio anyway and a support person on the phone instructed us on how to download boingo and use that to run it. Not all the support people know this fix.The notebook adapter worked fine once set up with boingo but what kind of an outfit sells you a product that won't even work with their own software and requires boingo?May never buy another cisco product."
2,"""Page could not be displayed...""","This wireless card gave me a lot of problems. I first installed it into an older machine, and did not work at all. Then I installed it into a newer Windows XP laptop and worked, however it kept disconnecting me from the internet. There was no clear pattern to it. It gave me a lot of grief and I am not very internet savvy! Now I have Netgear and couldn't be happier!!!"
5,Plug and Play,"This installation went pretty straightforward. It was my first WI-FI wireless card. The reception is very good unless you plan to use this card 3 concrete walls away from your Access Point.In a nutshell:1) Install the CD2) Plug in the card3) Configure the Wep addressAfter that, the card is hot-pluggable as you can remove it or replug while your PC is on.Bingo. Done. I have nothing to complain about."
5,Really fast,I bought this card along with the linksys wireless-G router/4-port switch and now I am able to go anywhere in my house and be linked to my home network and the internet. Its 54MBPS speed doesnt let my broadband connection go to waste. I highly recommend it.
1,Not Happy,Supposedly shipped 3 days ago but does not seem to have left the first place yet.Supposed to be here today.
3,Not satisfied,The signals received are poor. I cant see enough networks. I thouth it will be better.
3,Not the best wireless adapter,"I have a built-in Atheros AR50004G wireless card, but my boyfriend has the WPC54G. The WPC54G is sturdy as heck, and worked great on our own home wireless network. But when we're traveling, I see five available networks for every one he sees. We've just moved to a new apartment, and I could leech Internet off a neighbor instead of paying $52 a month, but his adapter doesn't even know they exist. We're hoping to find a better external network card and save ourselves $600 a year!"
2,Not the greatest signal reciever,"I bought this card with the wireless-g broadband router.About 30 feet away from the router and NO CONNECTION. I have to be about 15 to 20 feet to be able to get a decent ""low"" signal. And the signal only has to travel through 3 walls, not even cement walls.I bought a laptop recently with a built in wireless g card and that card can pick up the signal from where this linksys can. the laptop is a Toshiba P25-S509....other than that, the card is easy to install specially with windows XP Pro and its nice to have a wireless network at home."
1,very short range,I have been using it in coffee shops. compared to other cards it does NOT pick up or connect to as many signals as other cards used by others. I am sometimes able to find only one signal when others find ten. sometimes I cannot find a signal and connot connect when everyone else does. would NOT buy again. but when it does find a signal it does not loose it.
1,throw away,I'm no computer expert but this was impossible to install and once there difficult to use. I'll be throwing this item in the trash.
2,not satisfactory,"I've been using this card with my IBM T30. It works fine, but it is easily disconnected, and many times doesn't catch the signal where other laptops connecting very well... Quite irritating.."
3,Reliable but problematic,"Product is relatively reliable if used in conjunction with Linux router. Connection speed is dissent if properly configured. That is also were it is problematic. Linksys went out of there way to make setup as nonstandard. You pretty much have to use their setup programs , that are crappy( sorry for use of this word, but it describes it too well) and difficult to use instead of standard Windows setup utilities. In addition to that upon resume Windows it hangs, on 1 CPU laptop it uses 100% of CPU and that makes whole computer unresponsive. Their services take up to 50 MB of memory, that in my laptop is a lot - I have 256 MB over all. If you have to configure your router and this card at the same time - forget it about it. If router is not properly setup you will never make it work. I put 3 starts here because overall it does what it supposed to - connect my computer to network."
3,Linksys WPC54G wireless notebook adapter,I wanted to upgrade an older laptop's wireless security from WEP to WPA. My old pcmcia network card was several years old and was 802.11b plus had WEP as the only security option. I have a Linksys wireless router so thought the Linksys unit would be a good choice.No problem with the setup but I found the signal strength was low when the computer was in the same location as when using the old card.The price was acceptable compared to local big box stores. The unit did work but users may have less range than would be acceptable.
2,Disappointed,"I was sent an adapter that has no English instructions, so I've not been able to install it so far. I'm trying to search online for instructions to make it work."
2,Wireless Card,"After diappointing start, replaced card works. New card out of box was defective. After several sessions with customer service(?) reps. got authorization for RMA. RMA proceedure very confusing, and overly comlicated. Replacement card installed, and WORKS! Lost almost 3 weeks of use."
2,Nothing great about it,I find that I have to constantly uninstall and re-install this as it stops functioning frequently after turning off the comp. I do not know if others are also facing the problem or this is a defective piece. I can definitely work wireless option with it once functioning but take care of the extra time you need for the installation every time.
2,Linksys card w/ Dell laptop,"This card doesn't seem to get a good signal unless really close to the hub. Connection tends to go out randomly. Even with a low signal, however, internet connection is pretty good (except when the signal's lost)"
1,Bad experience!,"I've had to put forth herculean efforts to get any resutls out of this card. Aside from the fact that it initally locked up my HP laptop (until the beta drivers arrived), I still can't get it to reliably connect to the WAP.What is most frustrating is that the adapter often ""sees"" the network, but won't connect. When it *does* connect, I only get a range of about 10 feet before the signal drops off.Overall, this has been a nightmare. Avoid!"
2,failed to connect,I planned to add WPA2 encryption with this card on an older laptop but it failed to connect to a Linksys router so I gave up. It did not even recognize either of the two network router broadcasts with the proprietary software.
1,Died!,"I bought the whole package, router, wireless NIC card for a PC and a wireless PCMCIA card for my notebook. Installation is pretty easy on all and the 1st 2 are still up. However. the WPC54G died and I'm playing hell trying to get it replaced."
4,"Reliable and functional, with a few rough edges","Gets the job done, about as well as it could be. My range is fantastic. The software could use a bit of improvement -- as long as it's working, it works great, but when something goes wrong, it's hard to fix. But for most users this will give them all they could ask for from wireless networking."
2,Stops working on Compaq Armada Laptop,"I'm running the beta/TI drivers for the WPC54G, but the network stops transmitting data after varying intervals. I can't even ping the router. I have to reboot the laptop. It took an eternity to configure the router and other NICs for high security--I had to keep reentering the code for 128bit. I finally turned off DHCP and manually assigned IPs. (6/19 update) Now the system ignores the hard-coded DNS addresses and can connect anywhere by IP by not by name. So, after rebooting, I manually restart the DNS Client Windows service and then it works. Also, the latest software update as of today errors out."
3,hangs xp on some laptops,"I have this card and the WRT54g router and this card works fine in some laptops but hangs xp on install of drivers on others. It works on IBM t models, and sotec 3120x, but from other forums I found HP/compaqs (and from this site dells) are having trouble with the G adapters. When it works, it's great, I have been able to stay connected for 6 or more hours,no drop connections and great speed and distance."
5,Works with Linux!,"I purchased this wireless adapter because a fellow reviewer said it worked with Linux systems. It does work very well! I installed it on a Dell Inspiron 2650 (an eight year-old laptop) that runs Xubuntu. I had to use a different internet connection to find information on how to install it on Xubuntu, but once I did, it worked like a charm. Having the installation CD really helped."
2,Yet Another Winmodem -- Not Suitable for Linux.,"This product does not work out-of-the-box with Linux, or other non-Windows/non-Apple operating systems.It appears to be a ""winmodem"", that is, the device was created with no native ability to work with any operating system, and relies on what it believes to be external Windows or Apple software drivers to operate. The ability to work with any operating system could have been built into the device by the manufacturer for a couple of dollars more.The device can be made to work with Linux by the use of external wrapper software to fool it into believing it is inside of a Windows operating system. The external wrapper software also provides an external software interface for the Linux operating system.My evaluation: For Linux users, worth neither the money nor the effort needed to make it work. This goes into the box with other cheap modems I can give away to my Windows using friends."
1,Need the Linksys Router,"This would never stay connected over the simplest things. The only way to reconnect to the internet is to uninstall and reinstall the program disc EVERY time. When you would seek help, they would ask you to do something with the router...key being Linksys's router. The adapter would probably would great if you got that. If you don't, don't bother."
1,"Junk, best avoided","The Linksys Wireless-G network looks like a good deal. It isn't. The only value of the thing is to connect you to a wireless network. It doens't do a good job of that. So as far as I'm concerned its a useless piece of junk that's cost me countless wasted hours of irritation.The drivers do not install cleanly, the included linksys management software conflicts with XP. It loses connections constantly, inexplicably. I've tried this with TWO different cards and had the same experience.Junk, best avoided."
1,Unable to use,"I have been unable to get this product to work. The phone assistance connecting me to an overseas problem resolution site was unable to resolve issues. After 30 to 40 minutes attempting to resolve technical and language problem, the line would go dead. Even having given my call back telephone number, no call back was made to continue the problem solving measures.Lynksys must create a simpler means to resolve issues. No thanks to buying another product from this company. I would not recommend this product, unless you have the skills to reolve your own issues."
5,Price Works Happy,Let's get to the point.This thing works fine my friend has an old laptop that need'ed this card so he could get wifi.well to that point i was talking about the card work's fine.
