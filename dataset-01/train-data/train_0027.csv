4,DOES work with Mac OS 10.4,"I have this working just fine right now on my Mac G4 desktop with Tiger. HOWEVER - I downloaded the driver for 10.2 and installed the adapter, and THEN upgraded from 10.2 to 10.4. I know they don't yet have a driver for 10.4 available, but if you can get it to work with a eariler OS then it can work in 10.4"
1,Doesn't work for ME or XP,"Like you, i'm trying to set up a wireless network; i'd like to connect my old computer (running Windows ME) to my newer desktop running XP. I bought this device at Staples b/c of its price and because it clearly stated it supported XP and ME. Well the drivers were no good for WinME, even the newest drivers from their website would not install correctly. So it was a dead appendage. Their tech support suggested I try it on a third computer we have, it runs XP. Well it installed fine, but could not link to my network (Netgear router), even after tweaking the router settings. He said he was getting a lot of calls with the exact same problem and suggested I return it and try another device. If possible I'm going to get a refund and buy a little better one - maybe a PCI wireless adapter, instead of the bottom of the barrel cheapo which is my wont. When will I learn? Learn from my mistakes folks and move along - nothing to see here."
1,Does not work with XP,"After spending several weekends installing & re-installing this product on my XP Pro box, to use with its sister product (Belkin F5D6130 AP), I GAVE UP. Included CD was flakey -- so, got new driver from Belkin website. Installed & worked -- until I rebooted, then XP froze up. Had to disable an XP service (SSDP Discovery). After reboot, USB device is recognized, but offline, and cannot bring online. I have extensive experience with networking (20 years). Tech support was of no help. Could be an XP problem, but note: Belkin Driver is ""unsigned"". Avoid this product (for XP) until Belkin releases a better XP driver. Going forward, I will be looking for a wireless Ethernet bridge, possibly LinkSys WET11."
2,Doesn't work with Win2000,"It simply doesn't work with my Win2000 & Apple base station.Not with the original driver, nor with the updates that can be downloaded from the Belkin site. Sad story. The frustrating thing is that sometimes it's ok, but then after a while it just dies. With the whole OS. Since I got the unit, I keep restarting my frozen computer..."
5,Gallavants,"This is the best cartoon I have seen in years. It is the movie that started all the insect movies. When watching it you see a lot of the Ideas that are used in both ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"". This is a must for anyone that has children, or just wanting to see a good cartoon for a change. This movie is great for all ages."
2,Short range only,"No matter how well this antenna was tuned I could not participate in conversations over 1 mile away. Makes for a difficult caravan.It did stay perfectly on the suburban roof for the 3,000 mile road trip never once coming off. Buy a better antenna."
4,Works Great,No issues at all even while driving through Hurricane Irene. Albeit in only 30-60 mpg wind gusts... Works great for the money.
1,Don't expect the A1500,"I ordered the A1500 and received the A1000. I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedback on this page. I didn't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed (as the other fellow did below). Amazon is usually pretty good, not this time, and not on this product.If you want, you can call them at:1.800.201.7575 (Toll free, US and Canada)1.206.346.2992 or 1.206.266.2992 (Outside US and Canada)1.877.586.3230 (Canada only)UK customer service: +44.208.636.9200"
1,They send the wrong antenna,I ordered the Cobra HG A1500 High Gear CB Antenna. They keep sending the Cobra HG A1000. Now I'm stuck with a antenna I did not order nor do I want.
4,Good value,"I purchased this antenna for camping and road trips and the ease of switching from one car to another quickly, and not having to drill holes for permanent mounting, etc. It comes with a fairly strong magnet that has no trouble hanging on at 70 mph. The silicon/rubber type base is nicer than the felt lined ones, it won't wear off and scratch your paint as it gets older. It is not a good idea to loose it. It is relatively short, and the set screw provides an easy way to trim your SWR's. It functions well for it's size, and has improved the range of my Midland 75-822 over the ""rubber duck"" antenna for auto use. I would have given it a 5 star rating if the silicone/rubber base was permanently fixed to the bottom, or was a tighter fit and would not come off as easy."
1,This model is a dud,It does not sharpen many pencils before it quits working. this is the 2nd one I purchased and I have to return this one also.
3,Good while it lasted,"Four school-aged kids sharpen a lot of pencils. This model did a great job for a few hundred sharpenings, but ultimately stopped working after just a few months. I can't be sure what made it broke (there is a fair chance of foul play from the kids), but I didn't find anything jammed in there. In my opinion these need to be built to withstand normal wear and tear from kids and this one didn't last long enough to feel good about."
2,Sharpens well but poorly designed.,"Likes:>Good, strong,""Extra Heavy Duty motor"" makes sharpening pencils a breeze.>Designed for ""Daily Continuous Usage"".>Intended for ""Office Use"".>""Pencilsaver"" prevents over-sharpening and waste.>Auto-reset to prevent motor burnout.>Relatively quiet.Dislikes:>VERY small/volume-challenged shavings receptacle/tray.>Only one standard sized opening for #2 pencils.>Shavings tray is part of the front cover; the weak plastic may not withstand repeated removal/reinstallation.>$50.29 for this?>Long term durability?Bottom Line:Lots of promises but failed to deliver on some crucial points: A high usage, heavy duty office pencil sharpener should have a much bigger shavings tray. Repeated emptying of the puny shavings tray may weaken/damage the weak plastic and attachment points. It doesn't require a rocket scientist to design an effective pencil sharpener; just good common sense!"
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY...,"I bought this sharpener less than a month ago and have two kids who use the sharpener along with me...we don't even use that many pencils and it burned out IN LESS THAN A MONTH. Will be trying a heavy duty electric stapler by Stanley...hopefully it will work out better than this hunk of junk I have now, and I bought it for more than what its selling for on Amazon!"
4,Works as it should,"This sharpener gives a very nice point and does it quickly. My only complaints: The base could be heavier or grip the desk better to prevent a little bit of sliding when you insert the pencil and it's easy to insert the pencil too far, stopping the motor. This makes operation a little less smooth for kids, the primary users in our house. That said, it absolutely does a good job and I am satisfied with it."
1,Poor signal,"I gave this one star because choosing zero was not an option.This unit is extremely slow to begin with, but when you are in the mountains, or any type of tree cover (and possibly clouds)... forget it. You would be better off with Ray Charles leading the way.I thought about purchasing data cables to upgrade the software, but the cable is almost as expensive as the unit."
4,Garmin eTrex 1.1-Inch GPS handy and well worth the money!,"I wanted a simple and affordabble handheld GPS and that's what I got, for very little money! Bill Lembright"
1,A real BORE,I would only recommend this book if you have trouble sleeping at night and need a sedative. It was all I could do to get through 2 of the short stories.
2,Just so so,"I picked up this book from an airport bookstore. I am a regular reader of short novels published on New Yorker and seems most stories in this book were published there, according to the introduction. I have to admit that I still could not understand why Ms. Munro is such a big figure in North America's modern literature world. The stories are full of too many pieces of ordinariness and dullness, and make you feel the heaviness of your life. Her stories makes you feel like, ""Why do I have to read in words about some DULL things I've seen/experienced in my life?"" By the way, I've lived in eastern Canada for 9 years and have very warm feeling towards that region.And her writing is also so plain and REGULAR! (I love Peter Mayle's style, by the way, which makes you appreciate English as a language so much.)Perhaps this has nothing to do with Ms. Munro but my personal reading preferences."
5,The Love of a Good Woman,Alice Munro is able to convey in twenty pages more character and depth than many people understand about themselves or their loved ones in a lifetime. She allows us to embrace our flaws and accept them with grace and understanding. She is an amazing writer and a voice of humanity to be admired.
2,Pretentious Book,"This book was disappointing and annoying. The plot was so contrived that it was difficult at times to figure out what was going on. It seemed like an exercise for the author to display how well read and erudite he is. I plowed through it, but was never convinced by the characters or the plot."
3,Not so great,"I have read every single one of Munro's collections, and this one is pretty weak compared to some of the other gems she has written. ""Save the Reaper"" is just bizarre and unbelievable, ""Jakarta"" is probably her weakest story ever, and not even Alice Munro can pull off a story in which the narrator is an INFANT. (""My Mother's Dream."") ""The Children Stay"" is horribly cliche, the Munro version of a Lifetime movie. Perhaps the only good stories in this collection are ""Before the Change"" and the title story. Go back to stuff she wrote in the Eighties and you will see why she is so renowned for her writing. Here she's just going through the motions."
5,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic",I have always loved the Anne of Green Gables stories/movies. My niece also loved watching them and my movies will be given to her for her children (since I do not have any children).
1,DVD burned wrong,Two copies had the wrong movie burned on the DVD. Both the box and the label were for the correct movie. Amazon handled replacement and refund easily.
1,Can you hear it?,"That sound would be Lucy Maude Montgomery rolling over in her grave. Loved the first 2 movies, but this thing was horrible."
1,If I could give no stars I would,Does not follow the books and turns Anne into a tramp. Its the worst movie ever. It totally changes and deviates from her true Charecter. Its nothing the writer ever ment for Anne.
1,TRASH!,"Loved the bookks.Loved the films Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Green Gables the Sequel.Hated Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story.This insulting trash should never have been made the way it was.It was Anne and Gilbert's sons who fought in World War 1 and not Gilbert, he would have been too old!And they had Anne acting all weird and out of character so much so that it really has bothered a lot of fans.Dont bother with this trash!"
2,Very Disappointing....,"The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because I thought the actors involved did a great job, they played the roles with heart and were very believable. The movie itself was very ""heavy"" to watch and not at ALL what I had hoped for. The first two were such fun loving films and this one is so dark and at times just odd. Like, the part at the end when Anne is saying goodbye to a friend whose son she saved during the war, and she tells him ""I will always think of Dominic as ours"", Uh....okay. Why would the baby be hers in any way??? Bizarre, just a weird thing to say. And the end was very annoying, when Anne and Gilbert fight to get Green Gables back and then decide to move away!!! I wish I'd never watched this one and just ended it with the second one, where Anne and Gil decide to be together."
1,Anyone who read the books will be highly disapointed,"When I heard that there was to be another Anne of Green Gables movie with Megan Follows (!!!) I was very excited. But as soon as I began watching this movie I realized that this story had absolutly nothing to do with the books written by L.M. Montgomery. The beauty, tragedy and humor that is found in the novels is tarnished by the film. For those who haven't read the books, read them, and for those who have I'd recommend watching Anne of Green Gables and the sequel again."
2,What?,"There should be laws against this kind of thing. The only connection between this film and the books OR the previous two films with the same cast (which were very good), is the names. I couldn't find one single thing that happened in any of the books in this film. It's not even a good film by itself - the plotline is really silly and none of the characters or their actions are at all appealing - as another reviewer has said, the part where she gives away Green Gables is just WRONG. The whole film is completely depressing. L M Montgomery would have a fit."
1,How Could You Do This?!?,"AAAGGGGHHHHHHH! That's the sound of millions of Anne of Green Gables fans screaming in collective disgust. Not only is this last Anne movie bad. It's HORRIFYINGLY bad! I am a strongly against capital punishment but this movie has given me pause. I can't believe the Canadian government didn't put the movies producer in front of a firing squad for the way he thoroughly trashed the wonderful stories of Anne, Gilbert and the gang (not to mention trashing the hopes of millions of Anne fans). How a movie producer could miss so badly after hitting two grand slams is totally beyond my comprehension. Why did he depart from the books and make up a totally different story? The first two Anne of Green Gables movies were beautifully done. This one gives censorship a good name."
1,"NOTHING like the first two wonderful ""Anne"" movies!","This movie was a horrible disappointment. I enjoy my Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies when I feel like watching a semi-dramatic but otherwise uplifting story. When I want to watch a depressing war movie, I will rent Saving Private Ryan. Plus, the whole story line about Diana being snobby and having marital troubles was just absurd. I wasted my money purchasing a movie I will never watch again."
1,Dont waste your time,"As a huge fan of Anne, this movie was the worst ever... There is no romance, and the movie seems thown together rather than thought out. If you are a fan, you will be disappointed, the ending to Anne of Avonlea was far better.. I am going to get the books and read them, hoping to drive this movie from my memory. Very disappointed."
2,worst ann movie yet,"this movie was awful, nothing like the first movie and even worse than the second"
1,Anne of Green Gables?,"I cannot even find a proper word to fit the description of this disappointing movie. A complete mess from start to finish is probably the best way to review this. I am not a ""all novels made into movies must be exact"" but this was so far from any of the actual novels that I'm sure poor Lucy Maud Montgomery would have cried bitter tears at this portrayal. How sad when the other two were so wonderful. I think the only thing that was the same as the novels is Anne and Gilbert are together. That's about it. What a shame."
1,"Just can't get into it, a drag","I loved the earlier Anne movies in childhood and I still do today. Unfortunately this third film is wrecked by the very unimaginative storytelling. The whole thing is full of cliches. It feels like the story was written in desparation in about a night. I literallly cringed when images from the previous two movies were shown as Anne's recollections, i suppose to make us feel sentimental or something. Just one of the unsuccessful aspects of this ""film."" The film itself deserves zero stars. The one star is entirely for the sake of the cast members, who are not to blame for the abysmal results of this film, the ""plot"" is worthless. An utter failure, a waste of money and talent and time. Why bother?"
1,Deeply disappointed,"I am a huge fan of the books and was so delighted years ago to come across the first and second movies. I was so filled with anticipation for the third that I bought it. I was deeply disappointed. Anne, Gilbert, Diana and Fred are all present, but that is the only resemblance to the book this movie has. One of many low points was Anne going across Europe by train dressed as a nun, drinking liquor from a flask (not kidding). The movie makers missed the importance of family and community embodied in the books and first two movies. If they ever make another movie, I hope they return to the books for their story line."
1,Why did Anne go to Europe?,THE GOOD: It was fun to laugh at the story line and try to predict what preposterous event would come next :)THE BAD: What possible good would come from a woman pursuing her husband onto the battlefield during a war? How many times did she interrupt legitimate work to ask where her husband was? Was he the only man in the war?THE UGLY: This character (and the plot in general) proved to be too unbelievable for my liking - Anne would have more common sense than to endanger others lives and her own for a nonsensical rescue mission.
1,Viewer discretion is advised!!!,"If you loved the first 2 annes, do NOT watch the 3rd one. Personally, I think the movie should be recalled by the FDA due to the hazardous and painful effects on the hearts and minds of Anne fans everywhere. Might as well watch Anne and Gilbert get divorced. That actually might be less painful. They should just remake it. I'll chip in my $0.02(literally and metaphorically) to help fund a redo of the 3rd one; and they should only release it to the unsuspecting public if it's deemed viewable by Anne fans. Anyone want to petition/hold fundraisers for a remake? In the mean time, just reread the books and use your Anne-like imagination.Dear Mr. Sullivan-In case you are listening--I have GREAT ideas for the remake, just email me and we'll talk;-)"
1,How could they do this???,"I was so disappointed to see this movie. I loved the first 2 and was pleasantly surprised to see that a third movie was being made. But, this one had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the true Anne story. I know the first 2 movies had small variations but this was total fiction. I can't believe the took the story of Anne and Gilbert and made it this way. What a sad day for Anne fans when this movie was made..."
4,Enjoyed!,"We really enjoyed this video- however it is quite different than the books it was taken from. Most of the video did not follow the books at all so if that is important to you , you may not enjoy it as much!"
2,What a shock!,"Watching Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea, was always a favorite activity for myself and two of my nieces (aged 12 and 10). When I got a hold of the Continuing Story, they insisted we watch it together for the first time. We were in for a shock! I had to completely calm them down before they went to bed - for they have of fear of terrible nightmares. I enjoyed it - but there should be some kind of warning that this installment of the movie, may not be appropriate for younger kids."
2,Sadly Disappointing!,"I like Lucy Maud Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series of books and I loved the movies Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea, The Continuing Story was on TV the other night and sadly I have to say I was disappointed with it, it was dull, had no resembalance to the books or the other movies and I was so bored!"
4,Troisième volet - Anne et la maison aux pignons verts,"Ce troisième volet de la série tant aimée au Canada est assurément celui qui contient le plus d'aventures et de rebondissements saisissants, le contexte historique s'y prtant bien. Les personnages ont bien vieillis et l'histoire est bonne et intéressante. Cependant, personnellement parlant, il y manque un je-ne-sais-quoi dans le traitement visuel et c'est la raison pour laquelle je ne lui accorde que 4 étoiles au lieu de 5, contrairement aux deux premiers films."
4,Anne Series,Have always enjoyed this series as a child growing up with it. When I discovered that there was more to the series I just had to get my hands on it. The Actress Megan Follow I felt did a fantastic job maintainning her charter Anne. I was a bit confused about story line. But over all it was great to see the gang together again one last time. Even if it were ten years after they made the first series.
3,Good and Long,"I have to agree with one of the other reviews, this film was interesting. Although it had a totally different twist to it than the books, I found it quite enjoyable. A bunch of the war stuff could have been cut out while still retaining the story line. That would have made a fairly good two hour movie. The price of a good two hour movie might have been less thereby giving the customer his money's worth."
1,Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story,"I was so dissapointed with this i gave it away unlike the first two i wouldnt watch again, it had not one ounce of the magic the first two had! it was a total waste of time making it!"
1,Yuck! No Stars For You!!!,"I grew up on the first two Anne movies and all of LM Montomery's works and this movie just sucked. Big time. Where in the freaking world did they come up with that story line? Ugh. I feel cheated. I want a remake...in fact, let's just start from square one with a filmmaker who cares about getting it right...maybe the folks over at the BBC are up to the challenge??? Anybody??? (echo....echo...)"
1,Homeless Anne of WW1,"What a missed opportunity!I have both the other installments on DVD and watched them again right before I watched the third. What a disappointment it was.There could have been so many other ways to write the third installment of this beloved story but, this writer decided to start a whole new story using Anne and Gil in totally different unbelievable tale of war and unhappiness.Would have loved to have seen Gil and Anne live at Green Gables, raise their family and have such friends as Morgan Harris' sister, a librarian, and Katherine as a school head mistress in Avon lea.This movie has been so disappointing to me it is almost traumatic.Please everyone save your money. I wished i had listened to others before I bought it."
1,So far from the books.,"This last installment of Anne on PBS was a complete disppointment. This movie marks a complete departure from anything vaguely resembling what LM Montgomery wrote.The inconsistencies are glaring. Diana and Fred living in Green Gables? Gilbert being the one going to war and Anne following as a nurse? Not even close. By WWI, Anne and Gilbert had been married for years and had 6 kids. The kids are the ones who fought in WWI.There are other problems as well with this movie and it is directly related to the writers not following the books. The movie does not have the same joy and charm that has been attributed to the other 2 movies.If you have not seen this movie and are a fan on Anne, stick with the first two and don't waste your time on this poorly conceived last movie."
1,Wrong in so many ways,"Im only giving it one star because the option of giving no starts is not available.I too was totaly disapointed in this film. The only thing that resembled the Anne of Green Gables series was the names of the charachters. Why the producers decided to go so far away from the series story....I have no idea. It's the wrong time frame, the wrong story line, the wrong character profiles. They set Green Gables on fire for goodness sake...absolute sacrilege. They set the timeperiod in WW1, with Anne and Gilbert just getting married. Please!!!! In Rilla of Ingleside (Montgomery's last Anne book), Anne's three sons go to fight in the war. The first two films were perfect so I don't know why the producers had to ruin it. What were they thinking? I can only hope that someone else will redo the series and include the great stories that begin in Anne's House of Dreams."
1,Ugh,"For any real fan of Anne's, this film is a mammoth disappointment. It doesn't follow the books AT ALL, but goes off on an improbable storyline that is both absurd and unsatisfying. In addition, for those who have read the books and know that Anne's SON goes off to fight in WWI, the idea that she follows Gilbert to Europe in the fracas is ridiculous. The only plus to the movie is seeing Megan Follows play Anne once more. She's so good at it... my reccomendation is to BORROW the movie from someone to watch it. It's not worth spending your money on. Hey, if you want the VHS, I'll GIVE it to you."
2,Disappointed Anne Fan,"I have been a devoted Anne Fan for as long as I can remember. I grew up watching the movies from the age of five or six, and I have read all of the books so many times that they are falling apart. So naturally when I heard that a third movie about my favorite literary character was coming out, I was so excited I could barely wait until it aired. What a disappointment that third installment turned out to be. While I was very happy that so many of the original cast were involved, I was upset by the extreme departure from the story line of L.M.Montgomery's books. The magical feeling of the first two movies was not present in the third. The spirit of Anne was gone. Plus, the time frame was completely off. In the books, Anne and Gilbert have sons fighting in World War I. Not at all consistent. The movie did have its good points. The acting was well done, and the scenery was lovely. But for such a long time fan of Anne, it was not what it should have been."
1,"This movie is not for the deaf to enjoy, because no CC",I am a deaf person and really enjoyed watching the first two movies with closed caption. I'm very disappointed that this movie don't even have closed caption in it. I noticed that the ones with closed caption have Walt Disney label on it. Obiviously this one doesn't. I know other deaf people would enjoy watching it. BUT it will be disappointing for them not able to watch and understand the movie. So I'm asking you PLEASE consider to have your movie closed caption. Thank you
3,a gift,"ordered this as a christmas present for my mother in law. haven't watched it myself, but it came right away!"
2,A quick review,"This sequel should have been called ""Anne of Gone with the Wind.""It had no light-heartedness of the first two movies, but I tried to like it. It had a sappy ending that made me cry the first time I watched it. On the plus side, it's better than the last season of ""Buffy."" I know all fans of ""Anne"" are going to watch it, so brace yourself and try to remember the good times."
4,A Different Anne Altogether,"I have read all but two of the Anne books...Anne of Green Gables and Rainbow Valley. I saw the film version of the first and skipped the latter since it really is about the Meredith Family. This film was entertaining but did not really follow the storylines that LM Montgomery established. One previous reviewer was right when they said if the characters were not named Anne and Gilbert it would be a great ""other"" film. I did like the fact that Anne finally marries Gilbert but the war elements were raw and very edgy. The scenery and the costumes were beautiful but this would not be a great family film especially if you are looking for sweet and wholesome here. It was nice to see the original cast and how they have matured."
1,The saddest and most disappointing conclusion to a series ever!!,"I received the triliogy of DVDs for Christmas this year and was so excited to finally see the finale of Anne of Green Gables. I had heard it wasn't as good as the first two but I thought I'd give it a chance. I wish I had that 3 hours of my life back. This has forever tainted my impression of the series- I wish I could erase it from my memory. If you love the first two, just don't watch the last one. It isn't worth your curiosity. I cannot even rate it one star. It is that bad. I don't know what Kevin Sullivan was thinking."
1,unimaginably bad,"I bought this despite the bad reviews because I thought it was impossible for an Anne movie to be that bad, but they managed to pull it off. Not only do they burn down Green Gables but they create chemistry between Anne and another man while things with Anne and Gil are cold. Come on people...all we want is a good chick flick with a nice ending!!"
2,A shocking heartbreak,"To a stranger who has never been in the world of L.M. Montgomery's novels, this movie would be systematically constructed, with enough romance and intrigue to satisfy anyone. However, myself, being someone who has read and loved all of L.M. Montgomery's books since I was young, this movie has been a heartbreak. I had in my heart a perfect mirror of Avonlea and all of Anne Shirley's doings. Marilla and Rachel Lynde lived in Green Gables while Anne and Gilbert moved to Four Winds. There was no war, no going to New York (which inflicted a horrible modernish streak to the setting of dear, old Avonlea). To add events at the end of Montgomery's books I could tolerate, but to smash them in the middle does not fit. I was in a state of shock; my mirror smashed with events that I could never imagine would have existed. A stranger could never see a crack in this mirror, but a kindred spirit can."
1,Kevin Sullivan sold out!,"Think about it, the 3rd movie in the series comes along approximately 15 years after the other 2. In my opinion, Kevin Sullivan saw that the popularity of the first 2 beloved movies was still strong, and decided to capitalize on it. But instead of understanding that the reason people loved the first 2 movies was the simple elegance and innocence of the story telling and setting, he decided to take the ""Hollywood"" route, and make a war & violence tale. I guess following the stories in the book series (Anne & Gilbert get married, settle down, have a bunch of kids) was too boring, and didn't have the $ making potential for Mr.Sullivan. It's a shame, in the quest for the almighty dollar, he let down a lot of fans."
1,Disappointing,"This is the third installment in a series of dramatizations of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved Anne of Green Gables novels. Megan Follows and Jonathon Crombie return in their usual roles. Unfortunately, this third production does not meet the high standards set by the first, faithful installment. In a total of seven Anne novels, Montgomery provided fully enough amusing, sentimental, and unabashedly romantic material for three movies. It was a pity that the second production (Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel) departed somewhat from the novels; it's a crime that this third production leaves Montgomery behind entirely, transporting her characters forward in time, pitchforking them into a trite war plot, and resolving the incoherent plot elements with a tepid, candy-coated ending."
1,So disppointed,"I was so shocked as I watched Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story, This is not Anne and Gilbert's Story.We had waited so long, and were over the moon when we hear that Part 3 was on its way.To be honesty, Mr Sullivan you should NOT have bothered and got our hopes up so. Rilla,s story yes, difference characters a whole new story great, but this was not Anne of Green Gables. It is so out of sync.Buying it was a waste of money, watching it a waste of time for LMM lovers and any one who loved and cherished the First two parts. If you just HAVE to watch it borrow it from the Library."
1,"Skip this movie and read ""Rilla of Ingleside"" instead","""Rilla"" is the 8th ""Anne"" book, and beautifully tells the story of Gilbert & Anne's family during World War I. It is extremely well written and covers this era of history in a compelling way. It may be the best book of the series, as it brings the beloved Anne into the ""real world"" yet remains true to her character. Again, skip the movie...but read this glorious book."
2,worth missing,"Unfortunately I saw this movie on the shelf and just grabbed it up, thinking it would be just as heartwarming as the other two. WRONG! The acting is terrible and the story is depressing. Not recomended at all!"
1,Not the same as Anne 1 & 2.,"This was a major disappointment. I loved the first and second of the Anne series, but this one does not have the same feel or charm that made Anne 1 and 2 so loved. Its like its not Kevin Sullivan making this. Its far to artsy and revolves around the war rather than the characters and green gables. They hardly even show green gables and it even gets burned down. (How could they do that!). I wish I'd never watched this, as its ruined the way I imagined Anne and the others to have lived, happily ever after is what I expected."
3,not what I expected,"I was hoping that it would stick to the original novels, but there are 8 of them after all, and the DVD's would have to go on for quite a while to fit it all in. They should have stuck to the original plot, like the other movies, and the fans of these beloved tales of Anne would have given much better reviews. If they perhaps completed the project sooner, the actors themselves would not look so much older, but you can't stop the aging process unfortunetly. It was a decent try, but the plot was too much to handle."
1,Might be OK if it wasn't called Anne of Green Gables,"This is the kind of adaptation that I really can't stand - Kevin Sullivan simply borrowed beloved, developed characters and then wrote his own story about them. I can only assume he knew calling her Anne Shirley would help this slanted, outlandish story sell. None of the characters in this movie share anything with Montgomery's characters except for their names.Montgomery left a legacy for Anne, not to mention a mountain of other works, so to create an Anne like this is not only a complete departure from the character her creator wanted her to be, it is a departure from any political or cultural view Montgomery had.Sullivan might be a good story teller, but in order to find out, he needs to create his own characters and not steal ones created by someone else."
1,do NOT watch this movie,"I'm an avid fan of the Anne of Green Gables. I love the books, and I loved the first two movies.This just happened to be on PBS one night, and I proceeded to watch it, and become so disgusted that I had to re-read all of the Anne series (starting with Rilla of Ingleside), to wash away the memory.While this movie contains characters named Anne and Gilbert (and even Diana) - it has NOTHING to do with the Anne of Green Gables series. It doesn't follow any of the stories from the series, and the characters don't even act like themselves.Not only was this disappointing and upsetting, but that the director who did such a good job on the first two movies could make the mess that this movie is, is quite bewildering."
1,STOP! . . . You really need to read my review . . .,"I am like you at this very moment, you don't want to believe the reviews you are reading. . .but they are TRUE!I read all the reviews here before I purchased ""Anne of Green Gables-The Continuing Story"". I didn't want to believe what I read, because this is Anne of Green Gables, the last two videos were GREAT, why wouldn't this one be too? IT IS NOT WORTH IT!, please trust me on this.The beginning part of the movie is really nice to watch. . .then the war begins, Gilbert leaves and Anne leaves to go find Gilbert. And I am waiting and waiting for Anne to come back to Avonlea, but that never happens. The rest of movie is nothing but WAR WAR WAR. My wish finally comes true, Anne and Gilbert both comes back to Avonlea, but it is the last 10 minutes of the movie. THE END.Please, please do not waste your money. Just watch Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea over and over because those are the only two classics."
1,A huge disappointment . . .,"I eagerly looked forward to viewing ""The Continuing Story,"" but ended up hugely disappointed. Kevin Sullivan did not follow the continuing story of Anne and Gilbert as written by L.M. Montgomery. Instead he came from left field with a thin plot he devised and actually thought we would fall for it. Skip this film and read the books instead. You will find them far more satisfying."
1,Clunker!,"I have been reading the reviews and I am glad to know that I am not the only Anne fan who didn't like The Continuing Story! The books are magnificent and the Canadian mini-series Anne of Green Gables and Anne Of Green Gables The Sequel (Anne of Avonlea) were really good and Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie were great as Anne and Gilbert but when I sat down to watch The Continuing Story I was very, very, very disappointed with this boring clunker of a movie! I really agree with the reviewer who said she felt like the director threw out the books and came up with some action and adventure war movie! Gone is the charm, the wit and sophistication of the books and the previous entries in this movie trilogy and I can't recommend this disappointing movie to anyone! Also what was with them trying to make that this movie only took place a short time after Anne of Avonlea when it's so obvious that the actors have aged a lot since that time, especially Megan Follows."
1,Craptastic,"Wow. This movie was awful. I didn't read the books, but on its own, the movie is still incredibly sad. The dialogue is weak, the plot completely ridiculous, and even the acting was pretty atrocious (apparently all Megan Follows can do is hold people's faces in her hands in every scene.) Plus, Anne and Gilbert look to be about 35. Avoid seeing this movie - it is a waste of three hours of your life, and it doesn't actually in any way continue the story of Anne or Gilbert or anyone else. It is a shoddy attempt at making some kind of dramatic war movie, which Kevin Sullivan clearly isn't cut out to do. I enjoyed immensely his first two Anne films as well as his Avonlea series - he should stick to what he does well, because this is just plain embarassing."
1,HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!,"A crime against the ""Anne' series and an insult to the talent of Lucy Maude Montgomery!This movie has nothing to do with the Anne stories! Waste of time, film & talent :( SO SAD."
3,IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT ANNE OF GREEN GABLES REPORTS,"After seeing the first two Anne of Green Gables films, I couldn't believe how wonderful they were.I plan to see this last part of the trilogy, but i would like to first just say several things...1.) Keep in perspective that the first two Annes were made in 1985 and 1986. I was shocked to see that the last part was produced in the year 2000. Only a few short years ago!!!!2.) The actors are older~~~ALOT OLDER!!!!! Some have unfortunately passed on...not a good thing!!! So you're going to see alot of differences in nearly 15 years. The magic may not be the same!3.) For the lady who has written her own sequel, go to sullivansboutique.com, and there is the site of the man who directed, and produced it. It's a Canadian site, and you may get the address of how to contact them from there. Good Luck!!!"
1,Don't do it!!!!,"The first two are wonderful but don't waste your time or money on the Continuing Story. It is awful, isn't even similar to the books and she does very un-Anne like things. Not worth it at all and very disappointing!"
1,Atrocious!!!!,"Besides the obvious disgrace of the plot and character assassination, I was surprised that not many people mentioned the actual jump in time. The first novel is placed in 1878. How could Anne and Gilbert be in their 20s by 1914? That would be 36 years after Anne came to Green Gables, which would make her in her late 40s by the time the war begins. Does that mean they had a 20 year engagement? How does that make any sense? I think they could have done so many wonderful things with this story and they wasted the opportunity. What a shame."
1,Has NOTHING in common with the Books!!!!,"There is nothing---and I mean truly NOTHING---in common between the ""Anne books"" and this movie! It's quite horrible in every way. I wish I could give it negative stars! Yes, the second mini-series of this trilogy takes frequent license, but it retains enough episodes and character of the book to be quite enjoyable in it's own way. THIS little ""thing"" simply keeps a few character names, retains several original actors, and truly and completely makes up a story out of whole cloth. If they were in such an itch to make a WWI ""Anne,"" they could (and should) have made 'Rilla. But they made this atrocity instead. If you have ANY respect for the book, please just forget this movie exists. Hideous!"
2,Just all messed up.,"I liked having some of the old characters come back. But this is a complete departure from the books. If someone is going to take the trouble of making a book based movie, they ought to take the trouble to make it at least SIMILAR to the books! I suppose war and blood sell over at home adventures. There are so many wonderful things in the other books they could have chosen from to make another movie!"
2,not true to the book,"I don't know if anyone making this film cared to actually read the books before making this movie. In the books it's Anne and Gilbert's three sons that go to war, does anybody care that the movies just skipped about thirty years? And what was up with that Jack guy? He wasn't in the books and he ruins the innocent "" Anne"" feel of the movie, not that there was much of one to begin with. But I have to admit that the movie itself was OK, if you think about it as just a war movie and not an Anne movie."
2,"ok, but so far off","the movie was good but it was so far from the book it wasnt funny. anne and gilbert get married just before gilbert goes off to WWI. when he goes missing anne joins the red cross to find him. in the book it is anne's sons that go to war not them. the movie also portrayed anne's best friend, diana, marriage to be on the rocks. in the books diana and fred's marriage was perfectly happy. i also thought that the actors were too old for the ages they were supposed to be. this movie should have been filmed right after the last movie. it would have been better, esp. if they would have stuck to the book."
1,Why can't they get it right?,"Ok, so we want to be able to see what happens to Anne at the end of the sequel, instead of just reading about her. But why on earth couldn't the makers of this film get it closer to the books?The things that Anne and Gilbert end up doing in this film are what their children are supposed to do!So it might cost more money to introduce new characters, but as in the books, you don't actually see or hear about most of the older characters anyway, so new characters have to be developed.They wouldn't have had to cover the whole time of the children growing up, but at least put the story and original characters (Anne and Gilbert) in the correct historical setting."
2,"Nothing like the books, or the previous movies.","Why this movie was made I will never know. While somewhat entertaining, this movie had nothing to do with the books and didn't even feel like the two previous movies. While the first Anne movie follows the book very well, and Anne of Avenlea is enough like the books to keep you from being angry, at least it has the ""Anne feel"". THIS movie, doesn't. Unless you are just a huge fan of the cast, or like to fantasize about what might have happened had books 3-8 not been written, then maybe you will be a little entertained. Otherwise, watch the other two movies again and save yourself the dissapointment this movie will bring. For those of you who have never read the books: Gilbert never goes to war, the war isn't even mentioned in the books, Diana and Fred don't have trouble in their marriage, and Anne never gets her manuscript stolen OR dresses up as a nun to save some child the director invented."
1,Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story.....,"I too purchased this CD, the 3rd in the series of Anne of GG. However, the packaging claimed it was the Continueing Story of the married Anne, and the disk is marked the same. However, when played it is the 1st Anne of Green Gables as a young girl being adopted. A very costly mistake on the manufacture's part. Hope there is still time for a return or exchange!So, I can not honestly review the story or movie, as I have not seen it yet."
3,"Has its faults, but not a bad film","I enjoy the Anne of Green Gables films series, however this third installment to the film series, was somewhat disappointing. It was not a bad film, but I thought the plotting was bad. There was to many tragedies in this film, but I glad the film had a happy ending. Megan Follows was great as Anne Shirley. The first two films of the Anne of Green Gables film series were a lot better. but this third film had a lot of faults and poor plotting to the story."
2,WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!,"this movie is TOTALLY OFF! and it skips a huge amount of time. the great world war (WWI) doesn't take place until Anne's kids are old enough to fight in tha war and get married. not when she and Gilbert are. so this story has nothing to do with that of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. if you've never read teh books, it's a pretty good story. b ut if you have, don't bother. i wont even let anyone in my family buy it for me even though they know it will complete my set. don't bother with it if you are a true L.M. Montgomery fan."
2,"I wasn't impressed, BUT...","It's true that this film has nothing on the first two Anne movies. Not worth purchasing by any means. However, I did borrow a copy of it on DVD from my library and there is a 12-minute clip as a Special Feature of Marilla's death and various other occurences; the twins Davy and Dora, Rachel Linde, selling Green Gables. These are from the series 'Road to Avonlea' entitled ""Old Friends, Old Wounds"". I have not seen it myeslf, but it seems that this series is more like the first two movies, and truer to the books than this third one...something I will probably look into to help get over my disappointment in this film!Cheers."
2,Not the Established Characters.,"The first two ""Anne of Green Gables"" movies were terrific. Interesting characters carried you to a nicer place. This movie has more turmoil and disputes, rather than charming predicaments. Did not continue the characters of Green Gables for me.This movie should have been made with new actors, rather than the Green Gables cast, so that fans would not expect the charm of Avonlea to continue; which it does not here. However, if you have not seen the first two Anne movies, this film may be fine for you, and better than other things on TV today. I do recommend ""Road to Avonlea"", seasons 1-6."
1,Best Suited for the Landfill,This movie was so disappointing I threw it in the trash. It is not even worthy of passing on to someone else.
2,"Not horrible...but not great, either","I absolutely loved the first two Anne movies, and was thrilled to hear about a third being made. I missed its airing on TV, but found it here on Amazon. I'm not sorry I bought it, but let's just say it's...well...pretty sub-par. The whole thing has a very slapped-together feel, and even though the film is 3 hrs., the pacing is WAY too fast considering that they're throwing you into the events of WWI. I had no idea where anything was, who anybody was or why they were doing what they were doing...and what's worse is that I didn't care. It's a shame because the premise is a good one...and they have the strength of the returning actors. I still recommend this to anyone who's a big fan of the films...just seeing Anne and Gilbert together was worth the money for me. But it doesn't hold a candle to the other two movies."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"First of all this movie in no way goes by the other books of Anne Shirley. I read every book and the movie goes no where near it! Second, there really isn't any comforting aspect of this movie except in the end.Thirdly if you're going to make another movie of Anne please go by the books. Gilbert in no way goes into WWI, it was their son and it was disappointing to see none of their children they were to have in the movie. She has about 6 children. Come on. What happened. I'm a big Anne Shirley fan but I just couldn't take the way they took liberties with the story. Lucy Maud Montgomery would roll in her grave watching this movie!"
3,"Different, but still very good","It's a very good movie in itself - powerful, emotional and moving, but it is not true to the books whatsoever. If you are looking for the dramatisation of the later books, this isn't it. However, it makes for a great spinoff or alternative events of many people's favourite characters and if you are able to set the expectations from the books aside for a while, you'll like it."
4,Great for any fan of the previous Anne videos.,"I absoloutly enjoyed the continung story of Anne. I was just a little girl when I fell in love with the first series of vidoes and I was glued to the PBS station that ran the continuing story. I didn't know they had even made another one and I loved it. I have never read the books, but I have enjoyed the movies and my daughter now loves them as much as I do. This is a must to add to anyones collection of the Anne of Green Gables saga."
5,Love it,"I love Amazon and they did a good job. The Shipment was in good condition. Thanks Amazon. Guys, if ur thinking of purchasing some of the old stuffs like movies or drama which you can hardly find it nowadays, Amazon can help."
3,A Let Down,"I loved the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies, so when I found out there was another one,I was sure it would be just as good. I was a bit upset when I watched the movie. It was so off the story line. I was expecting the movie to be about Anne and Gilbert starting thir lives together not some war. In the movie Anne moves to New Youk with Gil and works as an editor. She meets a famous author who falls in love with her. Anne goes back to Anvonlea with Gil when he steals her book. Their everyone is full of the war and Gilbert leaves to fight. When Anne recieves all her letters to him back she gose to France to find him. She is swept up in a American spy group and is stuck wijth a baby who she got from a dying woman. She makes frinds and enimes while she learns the true meaning of life. Anne finds Gilbert and when they get home the start a new life.I tried to sum this up. I guess since the movie is made we must live with it, but it was a let down from the previous movies."
2,Should have stopped after the 2nd,"Very disapointing sequel not up to the same quality as the first two. Tried to turn it into an action adventure. Anne is no longer cute, charming, and talkative but haggard, dull and quiet. The entire movie was depressing and unrealistic. I wish I never saw it; it spoiled my memory of the first two."
2,Disappointed,"I love Anne and I love the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies, but this lacks the spark of the prior movies and the director's insistence on ridiculous coincidences is just beyond realism and ruins the story. I know Anne has to grow up, but this doesn't match the true character of who I believe most of us feel she is and I am sadly disappointed. I wish I would not have purchased it first and I will forever end my memory with such a bittersweet way. I give it two stars only because I enjoy seeing the original actors in the movie, but I regret my purchase and would have just stuck with the original movies and never watched this one."
1,I Don't Think L.M. Montgomery Would have Liked This Movie!,Anyone who has read the graet book series by Lucy Maude Montgomery and seen the original two movies that starred Megan Follows as Anne will totally hate this wretched movie for the way it abandoned the books and those movies and made something that is intirely a different story and a boring pretentious artzy fartzy movie that should cure your insomnia!
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible ending!!!",I would give this NO stars if I could! What a disappointing ending! I loved & followed every episode on TV & then bought the DVDs. I threw this one away after watching it. I figure I could be like Anne & DREAM of the way it SHOULD have ended! If you love the first two DVDs DO NOT SPOIL THE OTHERS BY BUYING this one!
1,Has nothing to do with the L.M. Montgomery Series -- and bad screenwriting to boot,"First, as others have pointed out, the story isn't a continuation of the Anne novels by L.M. Montgomery. It simply has nothing at all to do with it, although the characters have the same names.Second, the screen-writing is terrible. (And the plot is weak.) That's what comes of trying to imagine completely new contexts for old characters, and trying to tie them together using phrases/expressions from the older films. So even if one tries to forget the books, it's still a disappointing film."
1,"I have not read beyond the first 3 ""Anne"" books...","but I did not like this movie. The time sequencing was completely out-of-whack. ""Anne"" and ""Gilbert"" were too mature to be believable as mid-20-year-olds. It is obvious that much of the success of the first two films came from the tried and true words of L.M. Montgomery. In fact, Kevin Sullivan deserves a great deal of credit for introducing ""Anne"" to millions unfamiliar with the novels; the accolades he received were well-deserved. Perhaps he felt the need to top himself, who knows? Unfortunately, this film is an embarrassment. The plot is completely unbelievable, just like _Scarlett_ (the sequel to _Gone With the Wind_)."
2,Too dark to be part of the series,"I have to agree with the general dislike of this movie. I just think it's too much of a departure from the antics of younger Anne to be considered part of the series. It's completely different and there's nothing enjoyable about it. The entire movie is dark and gloomy, with nothing funny about it. Really disappointing."
1,Just doesn't make sense,"An interesting observation I made, being a big fan of the ""Avonlea"" series, was that Kevin Sullivan addressed Anne and Gilbert's relationship when the Gilbert character appeared on the episode to attend Marilla Cuthberts funeral. There was mention that Anne was unable to attend because she and some of their brood was ill. So why would Kevin Sullivan write a totally different and unbelievable story in this third installment, in which the characters don't even fit into the time period? I'm sure he must asked himself that question as well. The fact he flunked on ""Anne of Green Gables, The Continuing Story"" production doesn't take away from the fact he produced two wonderful Anne of Green Gables productions and a great family friendly TV series based on Avonlea. ""Wind at my Back"" based on the Depression is also a great series."
1,Not based on the books!,"I was a little too excited when I heard they were making another Anne movie. I'm a HUGE fan of Green Gables and Avonlea. HOWEVER this part of the story is not based on the books at all! So what makes Anne, Anne is missing completely. Save your money and buy the books, the real continuing saga."
2,something's missing,this one bombs very chopped it assumes a lot from the viewer very little character developing it jumps a lot poor directing and writing sorry the first two were great i tried hard to like it rambo would have been a better choice that night
1,RECEIVED WRONG DVD,"I ORDERED ALL THREE ANNE OF GREEN GABLES MOVIES FOR MY DAUGHTER AND FOUND THAT THE CONTINUING STORY, DESPITE BEING LABLED AS SUCH, WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST ANNE DVD. I'M SENDING THIS BACK FOR AN EXCHANGE, HOPING TO RECEIVE THE CORRECT ONE.THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING FROM AMAZON."
1,"Does not go well with Anne of Green Gables I, II","I actually saw this movie many years ago and forget how disappointed I was. I recently saw the first and second movie, own the second movie, and wanted to purchase the whole set;but then I just saw the third one -- Its a good thing I viewed this movie again to remind me of how bad it is, stopping me from owning the third one. I was so disgusted with how Anne of Green Gables The Continuing Story lacked so many elements that made the first two so wonderful. This movie came out 13 years after the second movie and the characters not only have aged but have changed so much. It is not at all interesting for the audiences dedicated to the first two. However, on the other hand, if I were to view this one with no connection to the first two it would be okay. I was just not interested enough to watch the third one again or own it because it is so different with dramatic changes and the characters or scenes do not grab your attention."
1,Crappy sequel,"This movie is so crappy, I don't even know where to begin. While Kevin Sullivan's first two movies did deviate somewhat from the books, the spirit and charm were maintained. None of that was there. In this movie, Anne is turned into a whiny alcoholic who seems to have no control of her own life. She certainly isn't LM Montgomery's Anne. And why do they have Marilla die of some stupid disease?! In the books, Marilla lived into her 80s and got to spoil her adopted grandchildren. Honestly, if Sullivan wasn't going to follow the books, he shouldn't have made this atrocity."
2,Such a disappointment,"Like many other Anne fans, I was excited to hear that a third Anne movie was in the works, and I watched it on PBS when it first aired. Even my attachment to the characters and interest in the first world war could not make this tripe enjoyable. As many others have already mentioned, there were four more books from which Kevin Sullivan could have drawn, but instead he made this awful mess. If you are a fan of the books, save your money. There is nothing of LMM in this film and not even the charming Follows and Crombie can save it."
1,Hardly worth my time,"I have watched the first two movies in this series more than once and enjoyed them. However, the third movie had nothing to do with the books. I got the set as a gift and it is unlikely that I will watch the the third movie again."
1,Horrible,"Please don't buy this movie! It should have another name a complete diffrence from the book, an utter disappoinment!"
1,awful...dreadful...disappointing...,"...and I have never read the books - this mess is inexcusable and should never have been made. The 'plot' is incredibly unbelievable, the worst sort of cliche melodrama, and the virtues that were so evidenced and detailed in the earlier films are swamped under. This is one movie you can afford to miss - I can think of nothing good to say about it."
1,Dreadful,"I simply couldn't finish watching this movie when it came out on T.V. It was devastating - especially since the first two movies in the ""Anne"" series are beautiful. Number III has nothing in common with the first two movies. All the characters are dim, weird versions of themselves - the plot is rotten and warped.It is the polar opposite of the heartwarming and uplifting previous ""Anne"" movies, which chronicle the story of an orphan on Prince Edward Island.Please don't watch it - it will wreck the perfection of what you saw before."
1,"Anne of ""Disappointment""","How could you Kevin Sullivan? After all of these years I have waited for the grand finale to the Anne of Green Gables I and II saga, I saw you tear apart L.M.'s precious, imaginative Anne-world. The adulterous tones you suggest are maddening. Anne would never do that, never in a million years. Thank you for catering to the part of the population that enjoys adultery, nudity and violence. You tarnished the innocence of what you had originally created in I and II. Thank you for not following anything L.M. wrote for you to follow. All you had to do was follow the book, not rewrite it. I will just pretend that this movie doesn't exist and let my imagination finish the rest!"
2,BIG Disappointment,"""Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story"" is a huge disappointment. This continuing story, sequel or whatever you want to call it should never have been made. Megan Follows' performance as Anne Shirley is horrible. This is not the Anne I remember from ""Anne of the Green Gables"" I am sorry to say. Her face and voice have changed radically. Megan Follows really did not age well. Her voice sounds like she's a ""two-pack-a-day"" smoker. It really is sad. As for the actual story I can only say that it borders on the ridiculous and ludicrous and reeks with mediocrity. The World War I sequences are foolish and laughable. The several coincidences that occur throughout this story are beyond all credibility. Sequels like this often destroy the original. I hope this does not affect ""Anne of the Green Gables."" ""Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story"" will be an eternal disappointment for many of us who loved Megan Follows in the original."
2,Buy the books,"The Continuing Story WAS butchered. The only things it kept were the key characters (and actors, bless them.) Since when did Anne & Gilbert live in New York? It also spent way too much time on the war. The last book shows what happens to home life during the war and NEVER goes to the battlefield. They should have stuck to the original story."
3,Not what I expected,"I was so excited when I heard that they were making a continuing story for the Anne movies a few years ago. I have always cherished the Anne stories and loved the movies as well. I grew up watching and reading them. I was very disapointed with the new movie. I thought that they should have tried to stick to the original continuing story. In the books, it is Anne's children that go through WWI not Anne and Gilbert. Also, I did not like how they portrayed their on-going relationship throughout the years. Anne and Gilbert would never have waited that long to get married and the original books that came after had such heartwarming characters and stories. It is a shame that they did not stick with the original story line."
1,Sprinkled with sexual innuendoes,"I am a great fan of Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea as I grew up with these films. Both movies are romantic and show the beauty of a simpler life. In the Continuing Story, Anne is not the young, attractive lady she once was and Gilbert has lost much of his handsomeness. Anne has a romantic intanglement with a Jack Garrison and it seems as though she is shown more with Fred Wright than with her beloved Gilbert. This moving is not heartwarming and sweet like its predecessors, but haphazard in plot. I do not recommend this movie to anyone wishing to see a clean movie, as it is sprinkled with sexual innuendoes."
1,DON'T BOTHER!!!,"I am thoroughly insulted, as should all devoted L.M. Montgomery fans be. Where is our beloved Anne? I've loved all of the Anne stories since I was a young girl, and to slaughter those literary masterpieces is unforgiveable. The line was pushed with the Anne of Avonlea film by mixing the stories up so terribley, and straying so from the true plot, but this.. this is heart wrenching. I pity anyone who wastes they're time with this film, you're in for nothing more than disappointment."
1,I am very disappoinsted.,This film lost simple life of characters and sense of humor of basis of Anne's series.
3,Good,"The continuing story of the original... with a change in story of what happens in Anne's life. Use of original characters, however, it's different in that it's set out exploring in a different region and much like a thriller action in the depths of war. Not as enjoyable as the first two."
3,liked it.,this is a good follow up in the sequel but anne of green gables is the best. anne of avonlea is second best. and this is 3rd best.
3,A bit disappointing,"I was looking forward to this new installment in the Anne of Green Gables movies, but I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with much of the storyline. They really should have remained true to the storyline in the books, rather than having Anne go off to search for Gilbert during the war and participating in espionage. That part of the storyline was somewhat entertaining but very unbelievable.However, it was nice to see all the original actors, and to finally see Anne & Gilbert marry (what they showed of it). Anne and her friends and family in Avonlea, and how they interacted with each other, is what made the first 2 movies so enjoyable. The fantastical exploits they had Anne go through this time really ruined most of the movie for me."
1,Sucks,"Well, I haven't seen it, but my beloved wife has got me hooked on the whole Avonlea etc and after buying the first two, I was ready to buy the third and last installment for her(me) for Valentines' Day.However, after reading all the reviews, I have NEVER seen such a broad consensus of the quality of a movie as 'The Continuing Story'. Perhaps that's because the first two are so moving, funny, and charming. As many reviewers have mentioned, they've been poisoned by a regrettably poor final installment to the series and would have rather ended it at Sequel 2. And that is how I plan to live the rest of my life. Without Sequel 3."
1,Never read the books but...,"There are many movies I would have rather watched than this movie.I would have rather sat down to the Joel Schumacher adaptation of the diaries of Laura Ingles Wilder! You know, the one where we see Ma & Par Ingles face off against the vampire Nazi's of Waltons Mountain whilst escaping from Hanibals canibal eliphants in the killing fields of Cambodia.This is just about how I feel this edition of the Anne productions differed in quality and tone from the previous two.Very Sad"
1,Not as Good,"I didn't like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea. I guess Anne and Gilbert was all grown up in the Continuing Story. Didn't really like the war atmosphere, felt so sad."
2,This movie was a huge let-down,"I think I only really dislike it because of how little it connects to the previous films (which are amazing). I think this one tries too hard to be an adventure movie and completely loses sight of the sentiment of the story written by Montgomery. Otherwise, it was mildly entertaining."
3,Interesting Movie,"This movie was very strange. It was really hard to follow. Anne goes to France to find her beloved Gilbert. She went from so many cities it was hard to follow. The storyline was strange as well. If the orginal cast hadn't been in it, it would have been an awful movie!!"
4,"not the anne we know, yet she is still engaging...","Yes, this is not based on any of the Anne books. That is true. And yet I found myself completely involved, yet again, in Anne's life. The characters remained fairly true to themselves, with the exception of Fred, and there were chords striken that brought back the bleakness found in ""Rilla of Ingleside"". That book dealt with WWI also, although it was a completely different story.I think it shows me that anyone could take Anne and Gilbert out of Avonlea and still weave an engaging story around them.In my heart I wish that each of the books in the Anne series would have been made into it's own movie, but I will take what I can get.If you are deeply devoted to the books, you will probably not enjoy this movie. But my daughters and I did, and it shares the shelf with our other Anne favorites."
4,Half-way,"I personally only saw half of this enchanting, dramatical movie. I have read the books, and I was happy to find that much creativity was put in this movie. Though I have only seen half (becuase my VCR didn't tape all of it) I found myself longing to know what happens in the end. I suggest this capturing, and heartfelt movie to all people who love the opomism in Anne Shirley."
1,Very Low Powered!,"I bought this item, and I am very very unhappy that its power level is equal to that of any other average FRS radio, however, this is a GMRS and it should have two full watts of power going out the antenna, but it does not. All the literature indicates that its real power level is a mere 500mw, or half a watt.Why waste money on another 1/2 watt radio? The features are nice, but not great, and the power level is very low for this kind of radio, so keep your money unitl Uniden realizes that features are important, but so is power.You have to wonder if newer technology is running up against established technology in the world of business radios."
5,hilarious!!!!!!!!!,These are the best books ever. I always look through it when I need a little pick me up and it always gives me a good laugh!!! Makes a great gift for somebody. I always order extras to have on hand..great last minute gift.
5,why did the chicken cross the road?,"to become a movie star....it's only a matter of time before hollywood grabs these little guys and makes a huge bundle ofcash from their witty loveable world. Ms. Tanen's book is darker than the first one, edgier, as the chickens continuetheir search for the perfect anecdote. I can't wait to see the movie. Hurry up and make it already."
3,Great Book just not the set up,"I have gotten ALOT out of this book! Its easy reading yet it still makes you think. I really enjoy the discussion questions, BUT I don't like how they are at the back of the book, it makes them inconvenient and as a result, I dont always ready them. I much prefer them to be at the end of each chapter or even online to just print out would be great, but that is the only reason I gave it the 3 as apposed to 4 or 5 stars."
5,Complete,My favorite author gives me hope for each day. The storms of life don't always turn out to be just showers but major disasters.....knowing that when I now hear thunder I know God is by my side to keep me from being frightened in the storm..
3,Pat Ruthen_Smear the lost years,"this kinda reminds me of the Frogs, only a little less freaky. and of early British folk like the Strawbs, only a little MORE freaky.But yes! Pat! PAT! between the Germs & before Nirvana & Foo Fighters, he did this.there's a quirky Queen cover on it too, so try this."
3,Jon graham,"This movie is rewatchable,...there's alot to be said for that. Basically a post apocalypse theme with pretty thin plot line,...but the action and ""actions"" or should I say post nuclear war behavior is more than entertaining and almost funny if it weren't for the very real themes concerning lack of food and killing. Definately watch this film whether you like nuke films or not."
4,DEF-CON 4...another perspective,"Look, everything ther other reviewers said about this movie is true, but so is this: I like this movie alot. I've watched it again and again for almost 15 years now. Yea, it's kinda B-rated (budget flick). But it's a cult classic, IMO. You've got to see it to appreciate it. Watch with an open mind. See if you can rent it 1st before you buy. If not, then ask yourself why this old, b-rated movie still commands a top selling price. See? This cult classic b-rated flick is endearing, extraordinary and mutated. :-) You'll really like it or you'll hate it. Good luck."
4,A good look into the dark ages.,"I found this DVD pretty entertaining and reasonably educational. I was a little surprised at how much the inquisition was DEFENDED by some historians. They also played down much of what I had learned previously (mostly concerning torture and murder) i will have to delve deeper into the subject to know be able to decide if the inquisition is simply a misunderstood and overhyped era, as much of this documentary suggested. (Fortunatley we will cover this in my medieval history class this fall)It was a watchable and entertaining video, and it certainly offered something in the way of education. (it wasn't the best as far as dramatizations are concerned and could've been more entertaining, but it was still good enough to hold my attention and keep me from getting bored.)"
4,Great historical fiction,"I read this when I was a kid and reread it recently and it's an absolute pleasure! The book deals with the period of the Crusades. It's set in the deserts around Syria/Palestine. The armies of the Crusaders have set up camp after a temporary truce. King Richard the Lion-Heart lies ill and members of the European nobility are scheming to make a profit at the expense of the Crusade. Around all this, a knight (the main character) is sent on a mission to negotiate a potential peace with Saladin.This book has the classic images of the Crusades: duels, secret convents hidden in the harsh, craggy rocks of the desert, hermits, sultans, kings, dukes, Nubian slaves, conspiracies, Arab doctors and the like. It makes fascinating reading and reveals a lot about the imagination of Scott and his time.This book is one of Scott's less famous works but very undeservedly so. I think it's as good as Ivanhoe."
4,Towering Characters in Exquisite Prose,"Reading Walter Scott is a bittersweet experience, as we admire his adroit and nimble use of our English language, even as we mourn our modern-day loss of appreciation for such skill. His characters, as always, are credible and rich. His vivid depiction of the stormy King Richard stands among his best. Richard's Muslim healing sage ever speaks with quiet, fiery wisdom. Predictably, Kenneth the Scot is the true hero -- humble, strong, and bravehearted. Considering that the story is burdened with battles that almost happen, love affairs that never quite consummate, and mystical scenes that never truly resolve, this classic book nevertheless holds the reader captive throughout, and delivers a satisfying ending."
2,Not what I had expected,"This course while extensive in activities, was not what I had expected. The course did not start out basic such as learning basic communication between two people. I think this course is better for someone who is some-what fluent in French already. In addition, this course is however good for refreshment or learning more where it comes to things such as ordering dinner or renting an apartment."
2,"If you know any French, skip this product","The graphics are nice and clear, and it does teach minimum skills for communicating as a tourist; if you want practice with very simple conversations, try it. You'll learn to say and understand things like "" I would like to rent an apartment"". But if you can conjugate verbs, write, read or speak a little in French, don't bother. I can't understand French movies or conversations at regular speeds, so I thought this might help. It did'nt."
5,beautiful,"I had no idea this book was so old.Was Rainbow Brite really around in 1940?!? Anyway,it is such a lovely book and cassette.And the song on it is adorable.Tata."
2,"Oriented Towards the Implementer, Not the User","This work contains over 800 pages of densly packed information. However at least 600 of those pages are directed towards system administrators who are implementing MS Project Server, not towards Project Managers who wish to use the tool.I purchased the book thinking it would help me use features such as Project Analyzer, Project Center, etc. Less than 140 pages are oriented towards the user. Those pages that are directed towards users describe each feature in detail, but don't present them in the context that a project manager would find appealing. For example, what I would like to know is: ""What are the top five views that would most enable a Project Manager to get a better grasp on how the project is doing?"" You won't find the information presented in that context."
3,Junky screws,"The sharpener itself is fine, but the screws are total junk. Two of the three screws broke while screwing them into the wood, they are just not made with very good metal. My advice is to use a set of good screws you have laying around the house just to be safe."
2,DRIVE-IN SECOND FEATURE,"""Are you really going out with him?""""UH-HUH"".""By the way, where did you meet him?""""I MET HIM AT THE CANDY STORE AND THEN WE WENT OUT IN HIS CONVERTABLE AND PLAYED CHICKEN WITH A COP.""""Cool.

1,I guess I got the lemon,"This fan *is* very quiet, when I hold it in my hand. However, when I mounted it to my Antec case's internal exhaust tunnel, the thing buzzes like crazy. I think it must be something out of balance, and that the exhaust tunnel serves as an amplifier for the noise. I even bought Antec's ""NoiseKiller"" product, which didn't help a bit.I also have a Zalman fan on the same exhaust tunnel, and it is ultra quiet."
2,fell apart in one month,"The ornament is beautiful. However, had strong chemical odor and fell apart in one month. I pulled it out of the aquarium by the handle and it fell off."
5,good decorations,"Decorations don't have to do much, but they shouldn't harm the fish. These ancient pot replicas are interesting, and the fish seem to enjoy them. In the month or so that I've had them they have not lost color, or peeled or hurt my fish in any way. I've got 3 different designs in 2 different tanks."
5,A History Lesson Upclose and Personal,"The book's title was intriguing and it did not disappoint!In fact, I kept turning to the back cover to check the photo of the teenager, Said Hyder Akbar, in amazement. I found his writing profound for a boy of seventeen.That he had the ability to record in such detail the events he experienced during summers as his father's trusted companion within the fledgling Hamid Karzai Government of Afghanistan was amazing.While reading this book, I could easily put myself in his place, a young American who fit into two worlds well.He was an insider with the US Army, and with his father's Pashtun People, trusted by both, believing the best about both.This story shows life as it is in Kunar Province and Kabul, often disappointing, dangerous, full of infighting, distrust.It is a wonderful way to learn about history from the perspective of one young American boy.Its point of view is mostly postive about the Karzai Govt.,"
4,A strong voice in a young man,"What a wonderful experience to find a book written by a student at a community college, Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, CA.What Hyder is experiencing is also what community college students often are after - finding out who they are, where they are supposed to be, looking for those second and third chances.Hyder's literary voice is already well developed despite his youth, no doubt because of the rich life experience he already has.I recommend this book to anybody interested not only in uncensored information on what really is going on in Afghanistan, but also to those of of us who are bridging countries and continents by being born in one and living in another."
4,well worth reading,"I was intrigued after hearing the author as a special correspondent on NPR's Morning Edition. His insightful recorded journal was riveting. To encourage my 79 year-old mother to keep mentally active, I often buy a second copy of a book for her to read simultaneously and then we discuss the book as we read it. She and I were both very impressed by the maturity and skill of this young author. We had both just finished reading the novel The Kite Runner which is set in Afghanistan. Said does a masterful job of viewing Afghanistan from both the perspective of an American and of a native son which makes the read both enjoyable and enlightening. My mother, who has very limited experience with other cultures and is very conservative, was quite moved by the dilemma of the people of Afghanistan. I think this is a must-read for anyone who wants to have a better global perspective than they are given by the evening news."
4,5 Plug Surge Protector,Arrived on time and was exactly as promised.Saving me from all those wires from theother surge protector!
3,"Not at all his best, but some brilliant moments","US is a difficult album to digest, mostly because the mood of the music mostly feels like a soundtrack to a French art film, but there are some real highlights. Love to be Loved, Steam and Digging in the Dirt are easily three of Gabriel's finest moments which give the listener some reason to buy the CD. Despite the somewhat somber mood of the 'soundtrack' pieces, the lyrical content is Gabriel's most honest and poignant to date. Kiss the Frog is more upbeat and cracks the door open to let a little bit of light into this otherwise disappointing album. Not a worthy follow up to So, if you wish to consider it that."
5,After the hugely,"After the hugely successfull and commercial So Peter Gabriel decided to make an album which gave him less success but was better. Of cource Gabriels always been an artist who has rarly missed and mostly hit unlike say Phil Collins. US is an album which combines the best attributes of Peters career, often longish instrumentally and lyrically strong compositions and a fine voice."
5,"""Us"" is ""So"" Amazing!","This album is just amazing.Comoing off the heights of his previous album ""SO"" Gabriel pulls off a great follow-up album with lots of African drums and dark exotic rhythms.My favorite songs are ""Digging In The Dirt"", ""Blood of Eden"", ""Only Us"" and ""Secret Woorldd"".Whoa, this album is just amazing. I love every song on here.Buy this CD 2 Day!"
5,One of my favorite albums!!!!,"I was shocked and surprised to read the Editorial review by Rob Stewart. This is one of Peter Gabriel's best albums. Way way way better than 'Sledgehammer' or 'Big'! This is one of my favorite albums - it has some of the most meanful, insightful and introspective songs. I encourage you to listen to the album in its entirety - you won't regret it."
5,A great album with amazing band music that you will enjoy!,The best songs in this CD are easily under-rated on the charts. The most elaborate songs that are very delicious to just sit back and eat up!
5,Us,"'Us' in the acclaimed follow up album to 'So' and while it was less commercially successful, many fans hailed it as return to Gabriel's true sound. It has many great songs, from the popular single 'Steam' to 'Digging In The Dirt' which was inspired by his marital break down. 'Blood Of Eden' is a beautiful ballad that shows Gabriel's songwriting talents fully. There are fun tracks as well like 'Kiss The Frog'. Overall 'Us' is a good album, with something there to delight new and old fans alike. Gabriel doing what he does best, writing top songs and performing them with passion. Well worth a buy.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,emotional masterpiece,"anytime a musician of gabriel's caliber digs deep within himself to conjour up painful emotions, a great album comes of it. US, is no different. it is gabriel's best, and most moving recording yet, and has the power to move the listener to tears. SO is an introspective look at gabriel's failed relationships with lovers, and his daughters. give it a chance to grow on you, and it won't dissapoint."
5,Passionate examination of love and the pain it can cause,"US lets Gabriel examine the emotional ups and downs of relationships. Starting with the plaintive cry for communication on ""Come Talk to Me,"" US takes the listener on a journey through the passion,(""Steam"") playfulness, (""Kiss That Frog"")and the pain (""Digging in the Dirt,"" Blood of Eden"")of life's great challenge, our ability to love and what can happen when it doesn't last. The music's softer here than on his earlier work; it has a meditative quality befitting the subject matter. The emotional depth here is stunning; Gabriel allows you to feel what he feels. A daring example of an artist whose willingness to share his turmoil has resulted in a moving experience."
1,not worth it,"$129.99 is a ""hot buy""????I bought this on clearance from the Belkin website 2 months ago for $30.I wouldn't even recommend it at that price.The firewall will not close off everything it leaves ""port 0"" open no matter what. And the only way to stealth port 80 is by redirecting it to a fake ip address.It also slows down such that browsing the web becomes an excruciatingly slow experience. The only way to fix it is to unplug the power and plug it back in whenever it goes slow. I have read reports that turning off the router's DHCP server might prevent that from happening... but DHCP is not something you should have to do without.This is an out of date product. Badly put together. Definitely not worth what Amazon is asking for it.Try to find a good deal on a Linksys or something... do not walk, RUN away from Belkin products."
2,Spend a little more and get a better router,I have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad. Two major problems with this router:1. Wireless range is BAD (I own a cheap router and it has twice the range)2. Router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple PC's are accessing the internet at once.I have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but doesn't. Hopefully they will come out with a new version soon!
1,Worst Router Ever...,"I have been using this router for six months now, first on Cable, then on DSL, and I can say without a doubt it is the worst router I have ever owned. With 3 computers on it (1 wired and 2 wireless), it needs to be reset every hour. The signal quality and range on the wireless is about half what its specs say that it should be. If this hadn't been given to me free, I would demand my money back. I would recommend getting a Linksys, or better yet, save your money and get a real Cisco switch. This is a typical example of poor quality end-user junk."
2,"Easy setup, poor range",I bought this unit after my Linksys wireless router died; I can therefore only compare it to the Linksys.Setup was EXTREMELY quick and easy. I got it up and running in just a few minutes. The UI of the admin app is very straight forward and I notice is strangely similar to the UI of SMC routers. I find it to be somewhat easier to work with than the Linksys UI.I am unfortunately not pleased with the transmission range of this router. I placed it in the exact same location that the Linksys had been in. A computer that was getting solid 100% connection strength with the Linksys is now only getting 50% with this unit. Another machine that was getting around 70% on the Linksys would not connect at all to this unit until it was moved to a different location.This would be an excellent unit were it not for the range problem... Perhaps there's a fix?
2,"Lousy range, easy setup","I purchased this router to set up a home network with two wired computers and one wireless laptop. Setup was fairly easy, although there are no good instructions as to how to configure your computer or printers. The range is about 20 feet in my house. After that it gets below 21% and loses its signal. I had to call Belkin customer support for setup help, and the best I can figure, the customer support center is in India. I don't have a problem with that, but one of the guys I talked to said he didn't have a computer with XP on it, only W98. I thought that was bizarre. They were never able to even comprehend what my problem was, but I finally solved it on my own. I would consider another product rather than this one."
2,Reliability Less Than Acceptable,"The setup was easy enough, but the reliability of the wireless signal to my laptops was not acceptable. Speed drops dramatically for unknown reason and I had to reboot the router at least once a week because speed was so slow. After turning off and back on, speed was back to normal."
1,Repeatedly Hangs,"This router has good functionality and ease of use, but reliability is more important for me and this router hangs about once a day, so I'm giving it 1 star. You need to unplug the power cord and plug it back in every time to get it to work again.The range is a bit disappointing, too. About 30ft indoors.On the plus side, 128bit WEP and ability to limit access by MAC address are nice, and it's very easy to set up.Reading around some forums makes me think that the hanging problem is not universal, so if you're lucky enough to get one that works, it's not a bad router if you don't need long range wireless.For me, I'm returning it for a refund."
2,Outdated Advice,"I'm getting married again after 20 years of being single & was looking for relevant advice. It was not to be found in this book. It's a very traditional stodgy book for people who are afraid to break the rules. There are better choices out there. Hint: look for books with the word ""grownup"" in the title!"
2,not happy at all,I bought this phone because I have used other panasonic product and have been very happy with them. granted there are a lot of nice features on this phone and it will go all over the place but mine only lasted 1 month before i started having nothing but problems. first the battery went bad. then the phone had more problems that wouldn't allow it to operate off the base unit. if it weren't for these fairly major problems it would have been and excellent phone.
1,Avoid at all costs,Terrible sound quality coupled with an expensive price combine to make this phone an ill-advised purchase.
1,Not as good as it should be,"I had the previous version of this phone (and 900 MHZ panasonic cordless before that), but when the headset jack went bad, I upgraded to this new model.It is not an upgrade, but a downgrade!1) The battery life is abysmal -- just about 1.25 hours of talk time, less than 1/2 the previous model. And it often cuts out when I'm on a call with clients without the beep warning.2) The action on the blue navigation button stinks. I can look up a number in a a phne book and dial it with my own fingers faster than scrolling through the phone's directory. What's the point?3) Performance with a headset is terrible. People are always saying that I sound very far away -- a problem I didn't have with the old phone (same headset and settings).I like the features (speaker with keypad, voicemail light), form factor and cordless performance. But this phone doesn't cut it for me anymore."
2,Great Phone - Horrible Battery Life,"The phone itself could be great. It has every feature that the average person could ever need. Fairly easy to figure out and use also. The problem... the battery lasts only for about a half an hour of talk time (after being on the charger all day) before it cuts out and can not be used again for several more hours. Over all, I would have to say not worth the aggravation"
1,Poor quality and design,"Very poor quality for a premium price. The sound quality is poor. There is a distinct background hiss on all channels. The battery doesn't keep a charge very long, and there is no mute key (an absolute must for a speaker phone)."
1,JUNK,"I GOT THIS PHONE 6-9 MONTHS AGO, IT WORKED VERY GOOD AT FIRST, BUT NOW WHEN I TALK ON CORDLESS PHONE NOONE CAN HEAR ME, I AM REDUCED TO USING THE SPEAKER PHONE. PANASONIC'S CUSTOMER SERVICE REALLY BITES, THEY NEED A LESSON IN CUSTOMER SERVICE 101. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE, U CAN DO MUCH BETTER WITH YOUR HARD EARN MONEY!"
1,WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT EVER!,...the problems with my phone started 3 months and 11 days after purchase. Panasonic are absolutely not there in support - their solution is to send the phone back to them for repair or they will send me a refurb (at my expense... thanks a lot). Meanwhile - my solution - BUY A NEW PHONE until they get around to returning mine to me! Great! Thanks! Never again....
1,Don't buy Panasonic 2.4 Ghz phones,"There is some type of flaw in the design of some of these models that prevent the hand set from being charged after a sometimes short period of time. I bought a 2.4 Ghz unit in June and about a week ago the hand set didn't recharge. I bought a new $20. battery and it still didn't recharge. So I took the unit back to Circuit City and tried to exchange it. The return guy told me that I had to call Panasonic for an authorization number. Called, talked to Dawn and she said that it was Panasonic's policy to only repair, never exchange defective merchandise. After a period of time I can understand that policy but three months. A 200 dollar phone should work better than that. The guy at Circuit City was so annoyed at this that he gave me an extended warranty on the phone and told me to go pick out another.The guy at Circuit City felt that there was some type of fundamental problem with these phones recharging the hand set."
5,Great starter set!,We received this as a wedding gift and I absolutely am sold on it! It's a great starter set for families that enjoy cooking. These pots are built strongly and tend to be very forgiving. Don't settle for less.
5,Best Bang For Your Buck,"I was looking specifically for stainless non-stick. Cuisinart offered the most options in their 10pc set. Others I looked at (Henckels, Calphalon) didn't have as much in their set and where considerably more money with out offering any more functionality. Cooking and cleaning is a cinch. Bought a couple of single pieces to complete my set. 12"" wok (by calphalon) and a 12"" fry. Only wish the finish was brushed stainless. Actual finish is glossy chrome."
5,The Purpose of Your Life,"In short, this book has saved my life! I have dealt with depression for a long time and keep asking the question ""What is the purpose of my life? Why am I here?"" This book answered those questions for me and helped to lead me down a path that gives purpose and meaning to my life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is asking themselves the same questions."
4,Finding our purpose,"Reading this book is a must because it will help you to find your purpose and choose the right career to fulfill your purpose. If you want a fulfilling career, read this book.Eva Jeannine MelocheAgeless Living Life CoachSoul Purpose, Career & Retirement Coach[....]"
2,Not so good.,"I couldn't even finish reading this book. I read the back of it and some reviews and got really excited to read it. When I got it though I read about half way through and then quit. It just couldn't keep my attention, I didn't see enough value in it for the size that it was, maybe if it was condensed down to around 60 pages without all the needless stories."
5,Quem gosta da boa musica brasileira?,"Este concerto è uma grande demostraao de talento, a irma de Caetano sempre è uma grande artista, tudo o mundo sabe disso!"
3,Think Twice Before Purchasing a Xerox Printer,"I Recently purchased a new computer with Windows ME. When I tried to download the correct driver for my 18 month old Docuprint P8, I found that Xerox has yet to release drivers for Windows ME. I'm sure the P8ex is a fine printer (I have no complaints with the performanceof my P8), just don't expect Xerox to support their product. Best of luck to anyone who purchases this when Windows XP comes out this fall."
4,Great Cookware,"I love this set...it cleans up great, Bar Keepers Friend is perfect for the job, and it is cheap at Walmart. My only complaint about the cookware is...the lids! The handles on top get hot! And because they are so flat the water rolls off when you lift it up and it makes a puddle on the counter. But, other than that, the pots and pans work great, couldn't be happier. They are nice and heavy too. I bought Cuisinart's Steamer to go on top of the 3 qt. pan and love that too!"
5,Great cookware for the price,"I purchased this cookware set for my boyfriend as a gift and he was very happy with it. I purchased it sight unseen, based on reviews I read and the the name Cuisinart. I cook alot myself and will say if someone gave a set to me, I would be very pleased. It is heavyweight, but not too heavy and has the appearance of the more expensive cookware, but is not expensive."
4,for the price it's AMAZING but there is only one thing bad,"I pretty much agree with all the other reviews. it's a cheaper poor man version of all-clad. only one thing that bothers me. When I used a wire whisk to whisk something in the pot, it scratches the pan ! I thought these pans are stainless steel 18/10 they should be pretty durable and strong. but there are scratches all over the bottom of my pans and they are really bad. also I went to their official site it says utensil should be plastic, wood or nylon.....so I shouldn't use metal utensil with these? it seems stupid that I can't use metal utensils with these 18/10 stainless steel pans."
2,merchandise problem,"Although I am sure that Cuisinart has a good product, I ordered the HENKEL set of cookware. It was a gift and, when the Cuisinart cookware arrived, I did not go to the effort of returning the item. When I first realized the problem, I wrongly assumed that Cuisinart owned HENKEL. Recommendation - be very careful, if you are ordering HENKEL cookware through AMAZON."
5,Love them! Now creating sets for my sons who love to cook!,"I have owned this cookware since it was originally introduced. I am now building sets for both of my grown sons, who love to cook. Good value and excellent performance."
3,disappointed in the size of the stock pot in the 7- piece set,"The multiclad pro is wonderful cookware, however, I was disappointed in the content of the 7-piece set. The stock pot in this set is only a 6 quart size. This size is not appropriate for preparing a pound of pasta. The set contents was not described in the Amazon product information and I wrongly assumed that the stock pot would be an 8 quart size. The small stock pot means that I will need to purchase the additional piece at the more expensive open-stock pricing..."
3,Cuisinart Multi-clad Cookware,"After much research and review reading, I bought the 7-piece Cuisinart Multi-clad Cookware set. It looks great.It will take a LOT of adjustment with this though. It takes a very long time to heat up but then it also seems to go from room temp to burning hot within a second or two, burning whatever is in the pan (and this is NOT when the pan is on high).Every pan now has mottled, milky marking on the inside bottom after the first use. Although it cooks almost like a non-stick, I have to really scrub to get these marking to fade and they never really go away unless I boil white vinegar in them each time.The pots themselves are very structurally sound, heavy, substantial. The lids are another story - almost tin-like.Not sorry I bought them - I just wish I had found a true review of this cookware and how high-maintenance it really is."
5,Love It,"I've only been a serious Stones fan since the late 80's. ""Steel Wheels"" was really my first Stones album and I've followed them ever since, and have slowly gone back buying selected albums, mostly after reading posts and comments on the Amazon boards. And of course, because of my tardiness getting into the Stones, all these old songs are, virtualy, brand new to me. And I simply love ""Stripped."" And the production is so clean. Just great."
3,A nice surprise,"The Stones beat the Obligatory Live Album curse by serving up a semi-Unplugged show, recorded before a small but enthusiastic audience and featuring an intriguing selection of songs (never thought I'd hear 'em do Spider And The Fly again, let alone with such, well, sass as they do here). A little heavy on the ballads -- what did we do to deserve both Wild Horses AND Slipping Away on the one disc? -- and the version of Like A Rolling Stone isn't fit to wipe Bob's shoes; but all in all, very playable. If you must buy only one of the Stones' EIGHT currently available live albums, buy Ya-Ya's; but if you already have that, then by all means take the plunge and pick up Stripped."
3,Live?,"This one is much better than other Stones live records, possibly because of the massive overdubs. It's not really live."
2,"Too clean, too overdubbed, too bad.","Why must the Stones overproduce all of their recordings these days (and for the last decade and a half)? Why can't they make albums like Ya-Ya and Exile anymore? Part of the beauty of the old Stones was that their records were a little bit rough, standing in sharp contrast to the whistle-clean songs of the Beatles. Maybe they should just hire George Martin from here on out."
3,Honestly Yuppies - It's not GREAT.,"Sure, it's always fun to hear the original ""Bad Boys"" of Rock N Roll stroll, or in this case, hobble down memory lane. But here, they sound so tired and bored. Even the novelty ""Unplugged"" approach isn't enough to resuscitate these exhausted, nearly expired attempts. Perhaps if they were to restage this stunt in the year 2025, maybe then it will have some relevance and even some edge. But as it is, its balls are dragging.The original version of every song done here is far superior, these are all so drained of energy. Even the absurdly overdue stab at ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is just mediocre. The engineering and audio quality may be superlative, and the approach interesting, sure. And even pleasant, but who the F*** needs the The Stones to be PLEASANT? Honestly, you withering, burnt out yuppies have SO overrated this sad, lame financially inspired hoax, it's no wonder the world's in the shape it is. It's all your fault..."
4,"Insightful, but Biased Look at the Justice System","This book gives a very interesting inside look into the world of criminal defense attorneys. The author gives her unique perspective on the law through stories of several cases she defended. While I found the book very interesting, especially her explanation of the Menendez case, I couldn't help thinking that she was giving only one side of the story and leaving out facts that didn't support her views of defendant's rights. Still, it was very enthralling and hard to put down."
1,Nothing more than a marketing piece,"This attorney either gets way too emotionally attached to her clients or she fashioned her syrupy prose in an artifical effort to win new ones. Numerous convicted drug dealers, murderers, and other felons are inexplicably canonized in this self-serving, turgid memoir. A criminal defense attorney's calling is indeed a noble one, but should stop well short of the glorification and/or rationalization of the criminal element that seeps throughout this book. A few nuggets on trial preparation, tactics, and strategy can be gleaned by a careful reader; however, books such as Black's Law and The Trial Lawyers provide richer insight and are far more credible."
4,small moments on a big planet,"An excellent collection, with exceptionally vivid characters. Not all of the stories struck me with the same weight, but the ones that did--""Voice Of The Sun,"" ""Wormwood,"" ""Viv's Bidding,"" ""Totem""--are among the best short fiction I've read in a long while. Lesser pieces like ""Sifting Through"" and the title story are still better than most, though they seemed somewhat brisk in their presentation. A minor qualm, and one that may have gone unnoticed if it weren't for the quality, length, and richness of the other stories. A highly recommended debut of short fiction."
4,Looks good,The only problem is that the coal in the bunkers is tan. There is not alot of room to paint it.
3,The second Peter Gabriel,"This album is the second in Peter's catalogue. This is the last album he made with more traditionnal sounds, before he released album number III and changed his musical style and sound.There is some good tracks in this one, my favorites are ""White shadow"", ""Indigo"" and the wonderful ""Home sweet HomeIt is a good album with but not as memorable as others that follows."
3,Gabriel's weakest album,"Peter Gabriel's second album is also his weakest. After a pair of excellent opening cuts in ""On the Air"" and the ode to punk rock ""D.I.Y."" the rest of the album is far less interesting. Part of the problem is that Gabriel here is in his most experimental phase. He would rebound resoundingly with his far superior third album."
3,carbon copy,"Peter Gabriel 2 is a carbon copy of his debut (diversly mixing Prog Rock with commercial material) but the songs for the most part are not as strong as those he had previously written. Peter does not for the most part feature the singing that made him always a strong vocalist and the best one of all the other former Genesis members nor does he write the songs quite as well and he steps back as a musician playing less on this album (only in fact on 4 tracks). Still what works on this album works well, the Prog Rocker White Shadow, the hard rock of D.I.Y and On The Air and the funk of Exposure."
1,no connetion,"In similar fashion to my review of his 2nd album, this album never resonated with me emotionally. There's something bland about it. 1, 4, passion, so, us, up... all far superior albums to me. I'm not a 'collector' type of person so I had to qualms about giving this cd and 2/melt away.I didn't start listening to his music until within the past decade so the chronology and expectations based on reviews and how it follows from a previously released album are irrelevant to the way my impressions are formed, which is nice."
1,Don't get ripped off!!!!!!!,"This is just a re-hash of the stereo CD, it's not ""re-mastered"" for multi-channel playback. You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album ""Dark SIde Of The Moon"" or the Eagles ""Hotel California"" or Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road""; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again."
3,"A great album, but there's some real problems","I consider this his weakest regular album until ""Up"" because of two issues:First; Robert Fripp's otherwise excellent production distorts Gabriel's voice for the entire album. This distortion might've been what Gabriel wanted, by since the 1st day I heard it, I thought the distortion is annoying.Second; I actually had the original single ""D.I.Y."" b/w ""Perspective"" on Irish Charisma BEFORE the album came out and ""Perspective"" on that 45 is longer than the edited version on the album. This edit has NEVER been corrected and the original-length of ""Perspective"" has never been issued since.Third; The remastered version - tho it's best I've heard it - should've had the remix of ""D.I.Y."", the long ""Perspective"" and ""Teddy Bear"" as bonus tracks.Otherwise, it's fine...but the distorted vocals still annoys me.Great material, tho"
2,Gabriel's weakest album,"I'm a Gabriel fanatic. I truly believe he is one of rock music's most gifted artists.Now for the bad news: PG was still searching for his own voice on this second solo effort, and hadn't yet found it. Although II is stylistically more cohesive than the first album, the production by Robert Fripp seems misguided at best, a muddy mess at worst. PG(I) was fun, II is dreary and grating.Maybe the scratching finger nails on the cover was Gabriel's response after listening to the end result!"
5,Fantastic SACD,This was never advertised as a multi-channel SACD and I am glad that they didn't try to reformat it. The definitive edition of Peter Gabriel's work is all on SACD now and are must-haves for any fan with an SACD player. What many people do not realize about SACD is that the sampling rate is 2.8 MILLION samples-per-second as opposed to a normal CD which is only 44.1 THOUSAND sps. It is as close to an analog stream that you can get.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you don't have a good ear for audio and a good stereo system to listen to high-definition audio on then obviously you will not hear the difference. But for Audiophiles? A dream come true.
3,Remastered version sounds worse to me!,"As a true Gabriel fan, I LOVE this underrated album, but I was doing a side-by-side comparrison of the songs to the original CD (which I bought as an Import several years before it was available in the US), and I don't understand at all this remastered version! It sounds sooo ""limited"". True the bass is more present, but things like the guitar riff at the beginning of DIY just sounds burried and all of Pete's rock 'n' roll vocals are squashed away. Same for ""Animal Magic"". I use a program that levels-out volumes so I get a true comparison. My original version is even at 128 kbps at the new one at 192 kbps. I wish I had not sold that import version back when I needed the cash. ""Perspective"" is an exception. It sounds better now, and I do believe all the other remastered discs are absolutely excellent (especially Security!) But I might try & find an old copy of Vol. 2 for ""On The Air"" ""DIY"" and ""Animal Magic""."
4,Gabriel continues to search for his sound,"Listening to the second album sounds an awful lot like listening to a Genesis album, not a Peter Gabriel Genesis album, but a post-Gabriel Genesis album. However, you do hear that distinct Gabriel sound starting to emerge, just a little. I have to admit that I do like this album more than Gabriel's first CD, which I thought was very confused and all over the place. However, this album is not anywhere close to the two masterpieces that were to come (in his 3rd and 4th albums). All in all, I give favorable marks to this album, because it provides a hint of the genius to come. No, there are no singles from this album and it does not really go out of it's way to be commercial."
3,Wow Gabriel produced by Fripp! It must be good right? Wrong!,"I never ""got"" this record. It plays well and was well produced but was nothing like I expected from the master Fripp and ol' Pete. Then again thats probably what they intended to do and did the unexpected, so for that they've got one up on me."
5,Like a time machine...,"I thought the days of ""fun"" heavy metal were long gone. All that we had left were depressing, no talent, angry ""nu metal"" bands...Thank God Absolute Steel proved me wrong! This CD is great! Awesome guitar riffs, good lead singer, incredible solos... it's like being back in the 80s!If you love 80s metal, having fun and rocking out... give Absolute Steel a try. You won't be disappointed."
4,About subtitles,Does anyone knows about the subtitles.if there are any??I need to know if this movie has subtitles in spanishThanks...
3,Cute and harmless,"This was a jumping off movie for the future ""stars"" of America.. . If you think Sara Jessica Parker is tooooo cute for words now, take a gander at her in this movie, she'll give you a cavity, also she's the the same size now and she was then, does she eat at all? Helen Hunt, just change the first letter of her last name and you'll see she was one in training even back then, and the cute as a button, pre-witch, Shannon D. is adorable in this, one of her first movie outings. As for the two guys, the cute one and the nerdy friend, I don't think I've seen either one of them in anything since this movie. Enjoy!"
5,How can you NOT love this movie?!,"This is the sterotypical 80's dance movie. It's got cute guys, spandex, corny music, and helen hunt... Ok, so maybe that's not so typical, but you've gotta believe me, Girls Just Want to Have Fun, is, well, FUN! You'll want to watch it again and again."
5,I love this movie,"I can't count the number of times I have watched this movie.It's one of those movies you can watch over and over.I have.I think that Lee Montgomery is so sexy.I also like the other famous actors and actresses in this movie,its also about dancing so that's a major plus too!!I love this movie."
5,Blast from the past!!,I love this movie. I used to watch it on tv when I was a kid and watching it again has been alot of fun. Cute innocent love story with a couple of great dance scenes.
5,Oldie but still a goodie,"For those of you who enjoy dance movies, here is one for you! This has been around since the mid-1980's and is still an all time favorite of mine. The music and dance moves are very addictive. Great soundtrack. The actors in this movie are all wonderful, many who have gone on to thier own successful shows. Definately worth checking out at least once, or twice, or in my case...just buy the movie!"
1,Stop the music...,this is one bad movie. It's simply horrible. Even the dancing can't be saved. Oh wee a terrible movie. Girls just wanna good movie and this one isn't it.
4,Loved it for years,"This movie is great. I have loved it since I was a kid. Most movies that you watch when you are a kid, aren't as good when you watch them in the later years. But this one is great. I was bopping away the whole time. It took me back to when I was watching whenever I was a kid. I loved it then and I still love it now."
3,Silly but enjoyable.,"Girls Just Want to Have Fun is annoying in places but overall this dance film is quite engaging. The dance numbers are incredible for its time period and Sarah Jessica Parker is a fantastic actress even in this drab film. Helen Hunt also stars and it's kinda funny that she once dated Matthew Broderick and Parker is now married to him. Look for a young Shannen Doherty in her pre-brat days. Parker makes this film fresh and fun, just watch it if you are a fan of her work."
4,80's flashback,"It was fabulous to see Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt when they were teenagers. Shanon Doherty even looked pre-teen. The dad was evil. Good, clean fun with an 80's soundtrack."
5,"Sexy, fun and Lovely!","I've been looking for this movie for a long time! I never thought that an oldie like this one will ever be released on DVD! Since the first time I saw it I fell in love with it, I love the dancing, 80's music and it is a nice story! If you like everything related to the eighties this movie is for you! Fun, sexy, just lovely!"
5,This movie rocks!!!!!,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 and I have rented it so many times after that my mom refused to rent it anymore. Then I wanted to buy it but she told me I already had the movie memorized. After a long hard search I finally found it. My friends and I watch this movie every friday, it is ""our"" movie. This is the movie that made me want to go to Catholic school, I in turn would not encurage people to go to drastic measures such as that. You need this movie, your life is not complete without it."
5,Loved it,"My friends and I have loved this movie for 9 years. We've made it our ""official"" movie, and watch it whenever we get together. GJWTHF is corny every once in a while, but it's funny, and surprisingly believable. If you can deal with the fact that people actually dressed that way, we all recommend this movie highly."
5,Charmingly Outdated,"It's so fun to see Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt as teenagers in this sweet, funny movie from the 80's. The clothes, the dancing, and the innocence are strictly from a time long gone by, but fun to visit in this peppy little chick flick."
1,Absolutely horrid!,"Just to clarify - I LOVE 80s movies, and have a pretty decent collection of DVDs representing the era. I got this movie since I haven't seen it before, and I liked main actors in it. But whoever directed this piece did a horrible job, acting is below even one star - I couldn't believe that the same actors - Helen Hunt, Sara Jessica Parker and Shannen Doherty did such good jobs on TV and in movies later in their careers. Sarah Jessica looked like she was trying waaaaay to hard, and Helen Hunt and Shannen Doherty were just... horrible. As far as the script goes... well, it was just empty. Somebody compared this movie to a Center Stage - well, I wouldn't, since there is no good choreography here at all - absolutely NOTHING to look at and enjoy. I got rid of this DVD the very next day after I watched it... Don't waste your time."
1,girls just want to have fun,"I am really dissappointed with Amazon. This product was meant to be delivered to me on the 19 March 2008. To date it has not been delivered, i have paid for it . I have tried to contact Amazon customer services to no avail. I will never purchase anything from the amazon website again."
5,Girls Just Wanna to Have Fun Movie,"Daughter is getting this for Christmas. I know she wants it, because her mom has it and she liked it. Thanks"
3,my wife made me view order and view this movie,"Ok, we started watching this movie, we only made it 15-20minutes into the show before we had to turn it off and put the baby to bed.. im going to try and throw this movie in the trash when my wife isnt looking.."
2,Only 1080i NOT 1080P and Dolby Digital MONO,"Blu-Ray should ALWAYS BE 1080P It is very disappointing when it is not. This is reflected in the image quality as well. Audio is not even remastered for surround and is in 1 Channel MONO. I can't believe they would even release this on Blu-ray this way as it is seemingly no better than standard DVD or even VHS! I am very disappointed in the product. The movie is a great 80's Flick but I just wish that they had taken a little more care and time to release it the right way.... Do not buy if only upgrading from a previous medium. If you have not previously owned this title then it is, unfortunately, still the best way to go.Girls Just Want to Have Fun [Blu-ray]"
5,Simply the Best Fitness Book I've Ever Read,"Fitness is my passion and I'm always reading books and articles about fitness. After a while, a lot of the information starts to sound the same. What a refreshing relief to have found this book! This is the first book that I can say that I really learned something from in years. It is divided into three parts; body conditioning, toning and shaping and advanced bodysculpting. While there is good info throughout the book, I found the advanced bodysculpting chapters to be of particular benefit. These chapters show how certain exercises can be combined to achieve optimal definition. The sample routines are great and demonstrate exactly how to incorporate the concepts into a total fitness program.Overall, the book is very well written and easy to understand. It's a great reference that I'll use time and again."
2,Only works at the gym,"I expecteded this book to contain exercises which I could do at home, but they required professional equipment, which I can not access. If you want a book to each you how to use exercise equipment, buy it, otherwise, don't."
3,"good, but lacking...","As a person wanting to get back into weightraining, I found this book very helpful and motivating. The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is because there was not one word about nutrition. I would have liked to have had a chapter on diet, supplements, nutrition, etc. I was hoping for a plan or sample plan that I might be able to follow, because if you're not eating right, alot of time and energy are wasted. I have since had to order a book on nutrition. (There wasn't even a recommendation for a nutrition plan or book)"
4,Great Sculpting How To,"This book and accompanying DVD are great. Clear and helpful instructions with just enough physiology 101 to understand the science behind sculpting. This is my third, and favorite, sculpting book."
2,Not for the Serious Bodybuilder,"It has nice basic information for someone new to weight training, but with titles like ""toning and sculpting"" its difficult to take seriously. No new information here - its no different from what I learned reading Muscle & Fitness Hers magazine. The pictures, especially the cover photo, are totally out of place. They feature models that look out of shape, either because they are far too thin with no muscle or because they appear flabby. Not very inspirational. I also agree with the others who wrote that the book appeared hastily put together. I felt like I could have written it."
2,Ok but could be improved,"As far as weight training goes, this is not really the best books out there. I gave it two stars simply because it gives an alternative to what similar exercises can be done at home if you're not at the gym, or if you don't have access to a gym (while traveling, for example). But even this is not enough. It seems that the book is hastily compiled. I would like to comment also about the models used in the book - personally, the don't have the look of someone working out or anything, with the impractical long coiffed hair and all that, that sometimes hid an essential part of the form during the exercise, like the shoulder. It would be more realistic to dress them as regular gym-goers do - like tying their hair up, for example, instead of having them look as if they're going to a pub. It's just irritating and unappealing.Plus, I agree with what one of the readers said about bad form in the book. Like I said, this book could be improved."
3,"Good ""take to the Gym"" book for beginners","I am just starting work training using this book and it delivers on the solid complete body workout it promises. It has pictures of the exercises and can be taken to the gym (not too big or fat). I would have given it a four if it had focussed a bit more on how to do the exercises (ie full range of motion etc). It has some ""inspirational"" interviews with fit women but no information on what they did to achieve their bodies so that part was not personal enough for me. All the same the exercises were good workouts, well illustrated and explained. I would still recommend it"
2,There's nothing new in here,"If you're new to weight training, this might be good for you because there's a lot of description and pictures. If you're a little more advanced, you might want to pass - there's nothing new in here, and some of the suggestions are a little old school for me."
1,Insulting to Women,"After espousing as fact that women lack focus and are distracted by esteem issues, this book then proceeds to train you exactly as if you were a man. The reason women get bigger is because they train isolated muscles at too high a weight - that isn't the kind of body most women want, which is why I got a book specific to women in the first place."
1,Terrible and horrible!,I could not believe how outdated this book seems to be. I opened it and to my horror it was terrible. The exercises are elementary at best and not explained well at all. I can't believe someone published this book.
5,Excellent writing style and content with great insights,"This text is an excellent compilation of classic texts, written from the unique perspective of a college classroom. The writing style is very compelling and kept me riveted to the journey through the classics. I loved the interpretations by the author and the professors teaching the class. I also thought it was incredible the way the author brought the essence of the classics to the reader in an understandable format. I have not had any extensive experience with many of these texts and the author sparked my interest in many of them and i will definitely read them for myself. I highly recommend this text to absolutely everyone. It is very well written and a pleasure to read."
3,Lacking in depth,"I can see that the interest of the author is waning towards the end of the book. No doubt the beginning part of the book was interestingly written, the later parts appears to me to be a mediocre writting, due possibly to the impatience of the author to 'just finish that damn book' or perhaps the pressure from the publisher for a book too long in the making.I find this book rather superficial especially the renaisance philosophers. However, having said that it is still an interesting read and a good introduction on these great western writters. Should you seriously look for a good introduction to western philosphy, I would recommend Sophie's World and Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy."
2,"""Western Cannon"" its not","This was not a great book, This reader envies and admires the author being able to return to Columbia College and partake in the ""Great Books Program"". The author could not maintain this reader's attention. Many passages from the classics seemed to drone on, peppered with some side-light descriptions of the author's younger ""college aged"" classmates. I can see by the number of five star reviews that this book was a hit with many readers. I thought it provided a narrow scope on classic literature. The book I read previous to this book was Harold Bloom's ""The Western Cannon"". Harold Bloom gives concrete examples and rules why a book should be considered a classic in Western Literature. This book by David Denby offers a more intuitive approach. I recommend Harold Bloom's book instead."
1,propagandist and misogynist,"I took up this book with no preconceptions, just positive review from people I knew, as a book that might help me find a way to personally rediscover classic book reading in adulthood. I ended up enrolling for the first time in my life in a class on feminism. Female readers: please make sure that you have ""fallen off of Daddy's lap"" (p. 386) before you read this. Those readers who would like a less bigoted, more normal approach to reading classics in adulthood would be better advised to check out Samuel Pickering's book, A Continuing Education. This book is strictly a self-indulgent piece of propaganda for the so-called ""Culture Wars."" Sad, very sad."
3,Boccaccio and Dante Alighieri,"Denby seems to find a pagan exuberance in Boccaccio. But he is very much wrong to claim that Boccaccio (1313-1350) was a contemporary of Dante Alighieri(1265-1321). They were not. In Italy they teach Dante and Boccaccio in every school and everybody knows the difference between the two. But not in the USA, no body knows who Dante was and the few who know Boccaccio is probably because of Hollywood. So he play the part of the teacher and be the ""Intellectual"" who knows all and telling others what culture is with false statements typical of Hollywood. Because of ""Intellectuals"" like him and his statements that people around the world consider mostly of the USA to be ignorant, arrogant and presumptuous."
3,CO2 cartridge,"As far as the seller it arrived on time in good condition. This is not the kind of thing that is easy to review. It fit in my life vest, but I will not know what to say unless I use it, which I hope I never do. This particular model is the most expensive no mater where you buy it. That is a manufacturer issue not a seller issue. You may want to check what kind of replacement cartridge is used before buying a PFD. I highly recommend you buy an additional rearm kit when you buy your PFD so you do not have to wait to get a replacement. The only reason I had to replace this was because I left it in the dingy when at a restaurant and there was a heavy rain. I now own two PFDs and one extra cartridge for the newest one."
4,Interviewee's question at the job interview,"Helpful book and quick, easy read on questions to ask during one's job interview. If anything it shows if the person seeking employment has done their share of preparation for the interview process. This book will help you focus on areas of employment that are important to you: performance measurement, promotions, personal development as well as figuring out company strategies and attitudes towards: outsourcing, competition, etc. At the end of the book there are helpful sample letters for both acceptance letter and letter for declining an offer.This book will completement any book that is preparing your for the interview process. It will make your shine and stand out in comparison with other applicants who are trying to wiggle it."
1,fake product,"Dear all,I received this Ultraviolet Man Liquid Metal Summer by Paco Rabanne and I was very disappointed. It is a fake product. The bar code was replaced by another one. Someone cut out the original barcode. I used it and after 30 minutes I could not smell the perfume anymore. Terrible product I want my money back."
4,Found the book a nice balance between reporting and analysis,"As someone who wants finance, accounting, and strategy all in one book, this does a nice job of integrating things. Current examples are great. Access to solutions to cases would be most helpful"
1,Impossible to read and over priced!,"As a senior executive and MBA student in a top 10 program I found this book to be one of, if not the worse textbook I have ever had to work with. It is nearly impossible to read, it lacks crucial information and explanation of the topic. The exercises are endlessly longwinded, and are not helpful in understanding the material. The presentation, i.e., font and layout are objectionable and make it all the less desirable. This is an expensive book that offered no value whatsoever to my work at learning this material. Others in my program expressed similar views of the book. (If possible I'd give it no stars.)"
4,"Don't judge this book by its cover! Not for beginners, but definitely for the future accounting professionals","This is a very highly detailed accounting book. It is definitely not designed for novices. If you already have a good beginning foundation in accounting, this book is an excellent sequel to help you better fine tune and master those accounting skills!"
1,"broad, limited illustrations of case problems","For someone with just the basic knowledge of accounting or finance, this book would certainly pose a challenge- especially with the case problems."
1,Expensive but Confusing,"If you would like to learn more about Financial Statement Analysis, this should probably not a right book of you. The author have put many simple ideas into complicated words, not to mention the poor demonstration of cases. The examples are based on too much assumptions, but the basis for these assumptions are not clearly explained (which should be one of the most crucial parts). In addition, the questions in the ""industry analysis"" are set by the answer, (that means he already know company A is an airline, company B is a computer manufacturer, then he merely give the financial statements to you, and analyse it as if he doesnt know which company was in which industry), so he must be able find his way to draw his conclusion--that A's statement is A, B's statement is B, no matter how similar the two statements are. Ridiculous!By the way, What you can learn from this book can be found on the internet, without charge.The book does not deserve its price."
2,"Good investigator, not such a good writer","Keppel is obviously a very intelligent man with vast experience in serial murder investigation, and at the forefront of his field. The book explores some very interesting concepts through the use of many famous investigations. However, Keppel seems to write with a real lack of emotion, which I guess is necessary in his job. Which is why he should stick with that job instead of trying to be a writer. The lack of emotion made it feel like I was reading a calculus textbook. Keppel also seems to repeat himself over and over throughout the different chapters. This only adds to the boredom."
2,Contradictory information,"I am curious about one thing: In the Forward by Ann Rule, Ms. Rule states that Pierce Brooks coined the term ""serial killer"". Yet in Robert Ressler's book ""I have Lived in the Monster: Inside the Mind of the World's most notorious Serial Killers"", Mr. Ressler states that he himself is the one who coined the term. Dr. Keppel also takes great liberties in his discussion of the Picquerism signature. He makes no attempt at presenting any data to support his theory that a ie. knife is a secondary sexual characteristic and , therefore, a stabbing constitutes a form of rape. My response to this book is not even luke warm."
4,A GOOD FILM,"I like this film alot. The combination of the legendary Mickey Rourke and the all time favourite Lori Singer was well cast, I thought. I really enjoy this film. Frank T.Wells and Scarlett, are intreresting characters, you want them to stick together and end up well."
2,Not as Good as the Red Opener,"I have the red color of this Splash bottle opener, but decided to buy the green one to match a new kitchen. The green one is quite inferior to the red opener. The red Splash contains a strong magnet under each ""petal"" and doesn't move on from a metal surface to which it becomes magnetized. However, the green opener only has magnets on every other ""petal"" and doesn't hold nearly as strong to the fridge. I don't know which was the other colors were made, but I ended up sending the green one back as it would pop up from the fridge when opening a bottle."
3,"From Germany, so it has to be good","This film will appeal to a select group, namely, those of us who grew up with a video camera and filmed our own horror movies. Das Komabrutale Duell is nothing more than that; a bunch of ""kids"" making a gore movie in their backyard. There is no plot to speak of, no performances worth mentioning and the gore is juvenile. If you are looking for a ""good"" movie, this is not it. If, however, you are looking for something that is filled with outrageous scenes of ridiculous bloodletting, over the top gore set pieces, and no moral point, than this is for you. The DVD transfer is poor, I assume from an old vhs tape, there are some production extras and outtakes that are amusing to watch. If you are in the right mood, this film is worth seeing."
5,A book that you have to keep close to you,Lowell gives us the inside on the development of new trends regarding global strategy. This book provides fresh ideas and innovative points of view that will help to manage your company to the top.This book it's a must for manager traveling the fast lane to the top of an organization.
1,Dreadful,"I borrowed this from the library before buying, and am I ever glad I didn't shell out the money for this program. The music is tinny and the singing tuneless. The words are more often shouted than sung. The children's pronunciation is awful, even to my non-native ear. Finally, the constant back-and-forth between French and English only confuses; immersion in the target language is the better choice, particularly for children. ..."
3,Not fantastic - but it entertained my kids!,"Contrary to other opinions, my girls loved this tape! The songs are difficult to interpret -- at first -- but with careful listening (and French ears hear some slips into English) & reinforcement by an adult, children CAN learn French words & phrases with this music. The ""Days of the Week"" song is one of our favorites. As with any language, perseverance pays off --..."
2,Nobody can play Lecuona like Lecuona,"To my knowledge, no other pianist, Cuban or otherwise, has tried to do a remake of Lecuona's own piano solo recordings. I can't blame them, for with incredibly large hands applied to playing his own compositions, Lecuona had an unmatched advantage.Frank Emilio Flynn's effort was noble, and he earns an E for effort, but get the original Lecuona recordings from the 1950's and hear those. One good thing that Emilio's recording does is to keep alive the piano music that was written and performed by Cuba's best classical composer of mid 20th century, forgotten even by classical pianists today, Ernesto Lecuona."
2,Boring,"I don't care for any of the Diablo games. If you want a game that you have to click your mouse button 50 times to kill a guy, buy this game. Overall, there are alot of better games to buy for your $60 bucks"
3,whats the real published date?,looking at the reviews on this book and they all seem to be great but why are the the reviews dated from 2002 if the book didnt come out till 2010? just confused. so how old is this book? im looking for something up to date. it may have been a great book from 2003 but TIM BURTON has done a great many things since than.
4,One of Hollands best symphonic albums,"One of Holland's prime exponents on the symphonic scene of the 70's. This albums has some gorgeous mellotron parts, especially heard on the long, fantastic title track. The first track, ""Carnival of the animals"" is a playful tune with ...great voice. ""Ebbtide"" is another catchy track with melodious hooks. The atmospheric ""Storm and thunder"" with its dramatic musical contrasts is another great track. But the titel track is the jewel in the crown here. Existing of smaller musical parts, creating a bigger whole. And that heavenly mellotron really shines on this recording."
5,The Swallow and the Tomcat,"This is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read.It is a book a child could read. It is a book that can bring tears, and laughter to a gown-up's eyes.There is a wonderful Brazilian flavor to the work.Jorge Amado is a genius of the first water.All is books are wonderful. This little short story is one of his best.A play of life as acted out in an animal world."
1,Loses something in the translation,I hope the Portuguese version is better than the English translation. Read in English only if someone powerful makes you do it.
3,Not what I expected from JJC,"[...] The book is a good primer on fudamental and technical analysis, but that is about it. I suppose that my expectations were too high. I subscribe to the website spin-off of thestreet.com, and find the commentary, reporting, and trading tips well worth the money. This is the sort of hard hitting writing that I expected in the book. My opinion, save your money on the book and just use the website daily."
4,Insightful!,"If you can make it past the typical James Cramer stock-market cheerleading, The Street.com's guide to investing is well worth a look for novices. Skip over the dated, New Economy hype and get right to the overview of global equity markets, including risk factors, economic indicators and corporate performance measures. Author Dave Kansas does a great job of summarizing these voluminous concepts in a way that's easy to digest and remember. This book reads much better than most of those in the investment field, perhaps because it was written by actual writers, not economic experts fumbling their way through the writing process, or ghostwriters churning out personality-free prose. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to beginning investors, with a word of warning: The tone of this book is still very much of the optimistic `90s era, and does not seem to reflect the subsequent market retreat."
5,Solid & thorough -- everyone can learn something.,This material is very thorough and very thoughtful. There is something here for both experienced investors and beginners. The style is as light as the subject matter can bear -- there's a hint of fun throughout. I wasn't sure if the book would be too simple for me -- but I like it VERY much.
3,"Good for the beginner, not sure about more than that","I was looking for something a bit more adept -- this is ""investing for dummies"" -- which has its place, but the title makes it look like it has some new ideas when, in fact, it's mostly advice you've read on thestreet.com and elsewhere, in one book. Valuable to a novice, a nice but unnecessary compendium for more experienced investors. While this book wasn't what I was looking for, I also think the rips on Cramer and thestreet.com are unwarranted and childish and the reviews based on those criticisms are off the mark."
1,Why Pay For a Paid Advertisement??,"The Street.com is just another overhyped dot-com company that couldn't keep its own financial house afloat so why take financial advice from a failure?You also have to wonder whether the 5-star ratings are all supplied by Street.com employees who are trying to look out for their own financial futures and jobs.BTW: The information in this book isn't even original or given in enough depth to do a reader much good. You'd be better off with a proven book like ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias or any book by Peter Lynch."
2,Carpenter In NY,"2 down in 2 days(not to mention the brad nailer a couple of months ago).Had the gun for 6 months and a month ago, it seemed it was not feeding the nails properly, and then a couple of days ago BANG! It stops complete. I take it apart, and the hammer had snapped where it is connected to the piston, and the piston is sideways. THIS IS ONE DAY AFTER THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY PARTNERS GUN THAT WAS 8 MONTHS OLD!!!! My partners Bostitch Brad Nailer also died after about 3 weeks a couple of months ago, and another partners 15 gauge died a little while back and it was only a few months old. The old Bostitch guns we have still work. They use oil, they are a LITTLE heavier, because they are made of sturdy metal, not aluminum and plastic! Get a Senco!"
1,Clearly just used,"I did some shopping before purchasing this gun. the price was the best around. The item was listed as refurbished, I've purchased refurbished items before with good results. Most time they are completly new, this was not the case with this one. This gun was clearly just USED. There was no attempt to clean it at all. There was sawdust all over it and in the case and there was somehow a nail hole in the magazine and it was missing all accesories. When i tried to return it I had to call back three time to get an RGA the final call was to a manager. My money way refunded fairly quickly though."
2,It was a great finish nailer unitl it broke.,I bought the nailer over a year ago and use it every few weeks when I get some finish work. It is light weight and it is easy to clear jams. One day it would not fire. I took it to be rebuilt and had an estimate of $100. The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $189. So I am ordering the Hitachi today.
3,Great for a While,"I bought this gun a couple of years ago, and have been using it quite a bit for finish work. It worked well for a couple of years, and then the firing pin began to stick. I took it to a nearby tool repair place, and they put some new kit inside, and it seemed to work again, but, within ~3 months of that repair, it is doing the same thing. Reading other reviews, seems like that may be a common problem. I am considering buying a Dewalt."
3,"great, at the start","This gun was real impressive the first 3 months of having it, barely ever jammed, light weight, good power. then it started jamming more and more. I won't use it anywhere that a good clean finish is needed due to fear of having a big $#&* blurting out of my mouth as the nail bends over half way and the piece of work is really marred up.If you can afford to buy a new gun every 5-6 months, then by all means, this is a great nailer, other wise go for one with oil lube and get a good high quality clear oil to put in it."
4,"Good Nailer, But Some Minor Problems","I've had one for about 3 years. It works well the vast majority of the time. I use it weekly, and enjoy it very much.There are two minor annoyances:1. The nailer jams once or twice almost every session of use. That probably averages to one jam every 75 or so shots. The jams are not difficult to clear, but sometimes result in marring my work.2. The tool puts a dent in the wood beside the nail unless I hold it in a particular way. I have looked for the cause and played with the depth adjustment, but to no avail. The problem is minor, but I wish I didn't have to remember to tweak it just right before I pull the trigger.This is the only finish nailer I've ever owned, so I don't know if level of trouble is normal for them. In any case, I am glad I own the tool."
1,not to be used more then once,"I am a carpenter in country nsw and bought the n62fnk2 about three years ago for a little over $500. Use it mainly for attaching mouldings and constructing eaves.in that time i have had to replace the driving pin so many times ive lost count (about 10)in between these time it works great however it not worth the hassel. My thoughts, it crap"
1,Stanley Bostitch nailers,"I have bought 3 Stanley Bostitch nailers / staplers now and they are alljunk. One of them double fires almost every time. The other two, thecheap plastic trigger has failed. I oil them every time I use them anduse S-B oil and neither one has more than 100 nails through it, but thetrigger simply does not work. I would never buy another and I wouldn'trecommend this brand to anyone.rt"
1,Duo-fast vs. Bostich,"From the sound of these reviews, the gun seems to work pretty good for homeowners & such. I've been a carpenter for 40 years. I've been using finish nailers for about 20 years. My last nail gun was a Duo-fast. I finally retired it recently, after 17+ years of service. Since the local lumber yard carries Bostich nails, I went with Bostich. I've had the gun 18 months & the piston rod has broken 3 times. Replacing it myself still cost me $35.00 a pop. Anybody who has trimmed a door or window or installed baseboard, knows it's immpossible not to hit a screw head or sheetrock nail once in a while. Well, everytime I hit one, the piston rod breaks. It breaks in the exact same spot. It appears to made of cast aluminum or something, instead of hardened or stainless steel. I like the gun & am thinking about getting somebody to manufacture a functional rod for me, since Bostich doesn't know how."
3,I used to have a SENCO,I just bought the Bostich finish nailer N62FNK-2. It arrived promptly and in good condition.IT IS SOOOO LIGHT! I had a SENCO sfn II which I recently gave to a freind as reward for a good deed. It was my intention to replace it with an identical unit but after reading the reviews on this page I decided to order the Bostitch. It looks as though the reviews are accurate.Time will tell if it is as reliable as the SENCO. So far I think I made the correct choice.
2,Jambs too often.,"I've been using this gun on 3/4"" Oak trim with 2"" nails. It jambs nearly every third nail. The smaller nails work great, but I don't recommend it for the larger ones."
2,good gun no ammo,"I liked the nailer, price, weight, and the ""set"" function were all nice. Then came time to buy new nails, there were none to be found (not even at the store I purchased it from).I had to return the nailer, because I couldn't find the nails I needed."
3,I will never use that many nails in a lifetime!,"Nailer is good, but I'm taking away 2 stars solely because they are ripping you off with the nails. I got an excellent deal on a hardly used model then found out that was offset by the fact that I had to buy 3700 nails. You can't even buy an assortment with equal amounts of each size. I needed two different sizes and now own over 7000 nails. Don't buy it new if you are a hobbyist of do-it-yourselfer. The sheer volume of nails will outlast the gun itself!"
2,Uncommon Angled Nails!!,"History:I've been building all my life and have extensive familiarity with all the tools of the trade.Review:I returned this gun before I ever used it. I only want to teach people about nail angles. I usually love Bostitch. I have their crown stapler with the quick change trigger and their F21PL framing nailer (see my review.) They are both awesome. This gun however, uses 28 degree nails, which are only used in Bostitch guns. Therefore, you have to buy more expensive, Bostitch-only nails, which you can't get at every store. Very disappointing. Bostitch finally started building other guns with the common nail angles, but you have to carefully make sure when you buy. They're just behind the times with this one.If you buy a finish nailer, get one with a 30-33 degree angle. They can be bought everywhere, and usually compatible between manufacturing brands. I recommend the Hitachi NT65MA4 finish nailer (see my review)."
1,Don't hold your breath waiting for delivery!,"It takes forever to come. I even emailed the owner and said I needed the book ASAP, still took 2 weeks to get to me. If they would have put it in regular mail right away if would have gotten to me within a week. Really disappointed."
1,Didn't work with Windows XP,"Ok, so Windows XP might be a bit advanced for such an inexpensive camera, but I wanted a very basic webcam I could talk to my significant other with for a few months while we're apart. This camera didn't come with drivers for Windows XP. I went to the website and downloaded what they said were the XP drivers, but still couldn't get it to work. I had my partner try to get it to work on my computer, he couldn't get it to work, and he's a computer guy! I finally sent it back and my brother-in-law and partner told me to go for the Logitech. I gave this one star because it didn't work for me...it might work perfectly well on all other OS's, but not on XP."
2,Product does not work with windows XP,"The product is most likly good. But It when I try to install it to my computer, the class install manager denied my request to install it. This was very frustrating beacaues I have to return it. The Micro Innovations customer service was terrible, the people would lie over the phone just to get rid of you. The man said he would e-mail me the drivers I needed to install it to my computer with windows XP. But never sent them. Non of this is Amazons fault but I wish that they show weather its compatible with windows XP."
3,"Good value, decent webcam, can work with Windows XP","Windows XP compatibility issues aside, this is a decent webcam with decent video quality. You can adjust the sharpness by rotating the circular frame around the camera eye, and there are three colored covers that come with the webcam - green, red, and blue. Although this webcam was only designed for compatibility up to Windows 2000, I have gotten the webcam to work on Windows XP just fine with the latest Windows 2000 drivers from www.mic-innovations.com. Occasionally (once every few months), I'll have to reinstall the drivers when Windows XP suddenly recognizes the webcam as ""new hardware"", but that's not much of a hassle."
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR WINDOWS XP,"This Camera DOES NOT WORK FOR WINDOW'S XP. If anyone knows how to get it to work please add a review. I have tried 3+ hours to get it to work with no luck. Micro Innovations needs to take down the ""XP Driver"" they claim to work from their website. Don't buy this cam if you have XP!!"
1,No Buy,I'm having lot of problems with this camera. Picture quality is poor. Software with this camera is not good for XP. There are drivers issues too.
4,Simple Cheap WebCam,"This webcam is good for video conferencing online. If you're searching for a cheap webcam, and this one happens to be the best price you can find, then I say get it. I noticed that motion is blurry on this particular webcam compared to the last cheap one I had. And I'm not sure if I just didn't set the settings properly, but it seems to need a lot of light to work too. Putting the different colored faceplates on is a little hard, but who cares about that really."
1,Do not buy if you have XP,"I downloaded XP driver from their website and patch also. Now XP doesnot complain about new hardware but I dont see ANYTHing on my camera. I dont know whats the problem. It run very well on my old PC but does not work on new one that has XP. SO as I changed my PC , i will have to go buy some other new webcam now."
5,Dad loves these!,"I purchased these olives for my dad, who first had them years ago. My cousin, who lived in Florida, would bring them when he came to Pennsylvania and my dad thought they were just great. Now Dad can enjoy them again."
1,In and Out of Morocco: A good way to get some sleep,"The book addresses the emigration movement that was started in Morocco by locals looking for work in Europe as well as the smuggling and musical influences present in the Rif region. Unfortunately the issues addressed seem to be taken from a purely Western perspective. David McMurray has attempted to transplant himself into a unique culture and draw many conclusions based upon his limited experiences and conversations with a few of the locals in Nador. The style of writing relied on many rambling recollections of scatterred conversaions and absurd assumptions made by McMurray during his stay in Morocco. I would not have even read this book, but it was required for a class that he teaches at Oregon State University. Needless to say, I fell asleep no less than fifteen times while reading the first five chapters of the book. I would not recommend reading this book unless it is required to complete the essay assigned in his class."
1,In and Out of Morocco,"David McMurray requires that students enrolled in his ANTH 210 course, Musics of Resistance, buy this book. Students are required to read it so that they can complete a little 15 point assignment. The book has nothing to do with the course, which focuses on different types of music in different cultures. The only real reason I can find for this requirement is so that the students of OSU are forced to purchase his book to increase how much money he recieves."
5,NICE,"BAM BAM's review was trashing Amazon, but it was supposed to be a review of the ITEM (the batteries), not Amazon.The batteries are great. Buying them online saves half the cost of in-store purchasing. I'm not sure if they actually last 2x as long...it would be hard to ever tell that, but I took them on a 4 day fishing trip, and shot about 188 pictures and 4 different videos totaling about 15 min together, and the batteries never showed any signs of running low - my 'low bat.' light never came on. Granted, 99% of those pictures were in daylight, with flash not being used, but my LCD screen is always on. That's a lot of pictures from a $2 set of batteries.Oxyride is the new standard I believe. Excellent."
1,Annoying....,"I ordered this item on July 27 with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping....it is now AUg 18 and Amazon is telling me shipment will take place about Sept. 22. Amazon...don""t advertise items you do not have (surely this can be tracked with a computer) and have me pay for your great prime shipping service when you don""t have the items to begin with!"
2,staring at my yard is much more entertaining to me...,"Unfortunately i was not impressed by this book, i had heard so many great things and bought it based on reviews, and my love of nature - but i have picked this book up three different times and can not get into it, i just find it boring. I am not a nature hater, i have a bird feeder, a bird bath, a dog and a cat as pets, I love animals and can stare at the birds at the feeder for a long time, infact that is much more entertaining to me than this slow moving, boring book. I will pass it on to a friend, and hopefully they can find the magic in the book that i was unable to appreciate. i just found it to be too dry."
2,sadly disappointing,"I bought this book based on the many good reviews, and was sadly disappointed. While I commend Ms Holmes on her thoroughness and attention to detail, this book was missing the humour I was looking for. As I was reading this book I kept wishing it had been written by Bill Bryson."
2,disappointed,"while i liked some interesting facts,i was shocked at her advocating killing sparrows and happy at starlings killed, killing wild animals just cause we dont like them is not right and shouldnt be glorified-or ecommended!not thier fault thier born here,shocked at this approach"
5,"Great writing, great science","This is a must-have for any household: a serious-minded, witty, often hilarious, gorgeously written account of the teeming natural world just outside the back door. The writing alone merits five stars. For her last book, Holmes was a finalist for an award that Stephen Hawking won, so she's no slouch in the science department, either."
4,Extremely Interesting!,"I must admit I picked up this book because of the cover. However it was a fun read. I am currently taking an ecology class and this book made such an interesting companion. Holmes writes about seemingly boring topics (at least to the type that don't really enjoy science) and make it interesting. My friends are probably slightly annoyed about hearing the fascinating details of pill bugs and crows. It's a fun read, though at times it can be a bit slow, pefect for nice summer days outside."
4,Singer crafts mic-cord noose,"Ikon is considered 'goth' I guess, and I picked this up years after it appeared, but it's decent enough dark rock. This was the first singer, Michael C, about the most truly depressed man in rock history. Sounding 100% like Ian Curtis, he goes through some lyrics that sound significantly less than anything Curtis penned, and yet the music saves the band again.The production is good, most of the songs have a nice, fat heavy bass, a pounding drum machine (though they used a real drummer sometimes) and a lot of it sounds like a very early, very depressed U2.The guy just finally gets on with it and actually writes a song called 'Suicide'. As if the previous 20 or so songs weren't about how unhappy he is, he just flat tells us. He later split with the band; one wonders why.I think A Moment in Time is a much stronger disc than this, but this is pretty close in sound and tone. The singer is very depressed, yet the music never is--it's actually driving, sometimes...hopeful."
4,"How golf clubs work, in great detail","Werner and Greig have written an excellent book on club design that is suprisingly practical. Each chapter is short and readable.The subject matter is directly applicable to playing golf. Golfers who have read Pelz and Hogan will enjoy the combination of analysis and golfing tips. The graphs and technical information can be difficult to interpert, but aren't essential to understanding the key points."
4,Engineers as authors are unique,"Well, it certainly seems that the authors put a LOT of time and effort into this work. They seem to have done a tremendous amount of testing, of clubs in particular. And, then they developed a mathematical model to introduce variables that would take a lifetime to replicate by actual imperical testing with (exhausted) golfers. The result is this work, with lots of experimentation and documentation, and quite a few conclusions. However, I don't think this is the book you want to labor through if you are looking for clear and concise explanations and recommendations for your personal club selection or modification. They say you can learn something from every experience. I have to say I learned quite a few things while reading. But it was a little tough going.The authors have a newer, and perhaps more concise book on nearly the same topic, which I have not read."
1,Out of date and poor scientific methods,Golf club components have changed considerably since this book was published. Many of the conclusions are arrived at through small sample testing (three different lengths of ideal shafts and concluding one of them is ideal) and are inaccurate for today's components. I would recommend anything by Dave Pelz or Tom Wishon rather than this book.
1,First hard drive to ever crash on me,"I've had many computers and many drives, but this is the first hard drive I've had that just inexplicably crashed on me. I turned on my computer, it started making loud grinding noises, and goodbye data. After reading other reviews, it's obvious that I'm not the only one to experience this from an IBM drive. I'll never buy an IBM hard drive again."
1,Stay away from IBM Deskstars! PLEASE!!,"Do your research before you consider buying ANY IBM Deskstar drive. Unfortunately, when I bought this drive, there weren't many reported problems...yet. There are rumors of a faulty batch of drives, but I think the truth is, it was an engineering flaw. My drive actually lasted 1 year, longer than many others. Then, it started making the dreaded clicking and spinning noises. I was lucky enough to lose only 1 partition and could backup the rest. Now I'm hesitant about even sending this drive back to IBM, just to receive a refurbished one, which could be in worse condition. I think I'm gonna get a new drive (probably Western Digital) and use this one as a backup. There's no advantage to getting an IBM Deskstar, even if it's cheaper.. so just stay away."
1,Waste of money,"Currently I'm going trough the 4th (yes, 4th!) replacement for this drive.IBM doesn't mention that the warranty replacements for these HDD's (and entire DeskStar line!) are actually HDD's refurbished by used parts in Hungary."
2,"Judging by the other reviews, I don't think this was a fluke","I'm an IT professional specializing in data storage and I've been very impressed with IBMs storage products for several years now.Now, I'm sad to say, my own home PC's hard drive has bitten the dust as well. When I cracked open my almost 2-year-old Dell to peek inside, what did I find...?...a 40GB IBM Deskstar! I hope it's a fluke, because I'm a firm believer in IBMs products - but the fact remains that the only HOME PC hard drive I've ever had crash came from Big Blue."
1,Belkin F5D6130 No web user nadme and password,"Works great out of the box. Problem is you can't configure it using the web based interface. You need the wizard...that's a problem the manual is worthless. Everyone withing a 500 radius of you will enjoy their ""free connection and bandwidth"" and that sucks."
4,A loud access point!,"I am a bit of a newbie to the world of wireless networking, and this is my first wireless access point.One thing that I think needs to be mentioned is that this access point makes an audible, very rapid clicking noise. I would guess this would completely insignificant to most users, but my current project involves building a silent, fanless PC, and this access point is curiously... loud. Maybe they're all that way, I don't know.Another reviewer mentioned that this access point needs to be configured with Windows. This is partly true. If you have a UNIX-based computer (including, I imagine, Mac OS X), there is an open source, free, console-based access point configuration utility availabe - do some searching on google. It's certainly harder to use than Belkin's Windows software, but it does work with this Belkin AP."
4,"Works great, but make sure what you need it for.","I was trying to use it as a range extender, but it seems to be uncompatible with my SMC7004AWBR router. I was able to set it up fast as an Access Point, it immeadiately signed me up and started to exchange packets, but I wasn't able to reach my router so I had to take it off the network.I also tried to make it work with my xbox to put my console online but wasn't able to do so either. So, if you are trying to use it to turn a wired network into wireless this is it, this is what you need, otherwise I hope you can succeed in what I couldn't."
1,Broke within two weeks,"It worked wonderfully for two weeks using it to browse the web and moderate downloading, but when I tried to transfer a 1GB file over my network, it developed a 23% packet loss that has persisted since. Presumably it overheated, but what a waste of $20 if I can't use my device without it breaking."
3,Works Pretty Good,"I have keratosis pilaris on back of my arms. I have been using this product for awhile now and it defintely helps smooth that area of my skin. I only gave the product 3 stars, because it smells odd and doesn't drastically cure the area. I use a buff puff also, but the lotion just minimizes the affected area, doesn't get rid of it. I'll continue to use it until something better comes out. Good product and worth trying if you are prone to keratorsis flare ups."
3,Does not support ANY capture software except what is bundled,"I found it impossible to capture video with any software except the feature poor software that came with the device. Adobe Premiere? Can't capture. Adobe After Effects? Can't capture. Windows Video? Can't capture. NOTHING can capture from the device but that freebie software. I left tech support a question about this. It took FIVE WEEKS (yes - 5) to get an answer!If you are happy with the included software, you're all set. If you want the ""professional"" results Dazzle brags about, forget it."
1,Avoid the Dazzle Hollywood DV-Bridge,"The Hollywood DV-Bridge was easy to set up and use, but it will randomly disconnect from the 1394 bus. In my case, it disconnects every 10-40 minutes. This seems to be power related - if the source is on the same supply as the bridge and computer, I can up the disconnect interval to several hours....>The worst part is support. My original complaint to Dazzle was submitted 2 Jan 03, and the first response came 13 Feb 03!! Today I tried calling tech support this morning and hung up after being on hold for more than an hour on their toll number.The two responses I've had from them so far (via email) have only repeated information in the database you can search yourself on the web plus one reference to an irrelevant Microsoft knowledge base article.The support alone should be enough for anyone to avoid this product."
3,Detroit experiment,"This double CD was a little bit of a dissapointment in all honesty, both CDs offer little in the way of hard, relentless, danecfloor techno. However there are some very nice tracks on here ranging from older, soulfull techno tracks to the more recent minimal techno that is so popular in Berlin at the moment. Both CDs fail to offer much excitment so dont expect to be raving to this, it is more something to stick on whilst doing the washing up, not bad to have in your collection, but not something your going to want to listen to over and over."
5,Our forefathers and mothers were indeed brave.,"Per Hansa,the Nordic and absoultley opptomistic main figure has the strength in his heart to help all in the settlement except for his wife Beret. Beret too far from her Norway has nothing to look at but the big sky. No doubt out of her element. She is tormented even by looking outside at the vast landscape. Written in Norwegian and translated into English I have learned that this Norwegian story writing tradiition has alot to teach writers who write from the heart. The text is so mature and inspiring. I always like a strong ending and I'd say next to Invisable Man, by Ralph Ellison this is as extraordinary. Read Giants in the Earth even if you never intended to. You should not miss this tale of bravery on the prarie frontier."
4,The Norwegian Character,"I grew up around Norwegians and felt I never really knew them. They seemed to be a dour, austere, pensive people. Rolvaag wrote this book in Norwegian for Norwegians, capturing the nature of that character. Per Hansa and Beret can't communicate what they really feel. Tonseten comes off as the stereotypical pompous know-it-all that non-Norwegians find hard to take. I can easily understand why some readers find the book boring. I first heard of the book many years ago growing up around Norwegians. If not for that I never would have read it."
1,Can't there be a zero star Rating?,"My 10th grade classmates and I were tortured with having to study this book in high school. Yes it's memorable, as the most boring and painfully slow read ever. Even war and peace was a joy compared to this ""epic bore"". I grew up in North Dakota so i know what living in the prairie is like. I know the hard winters and the need to be thrifty. The book was made into a movie which is equally painful. Let's cut to the end where the relief comes with the main character dying of hypothermia by a haystack, frozen to death. Ahhh blessed mercy of death from a painful existance. Sorry Mr. Upton (my English teacher back then) your literary taste is lost on me."
5,The American story,"This is a story of Norwegian immigrants to America and how they struggle against the harshness of nature to make new homes in a new land. This work was once required reading in schools in New York State and I remember as a schoolchild reading it with a certain degree of puzzlement and bewilderment. Now I understand to be a work through which many Norwegian Americans feel their own Americanization story is most accurately told. But the farming world of Per Hansa, the many complications of his family's and neighbors' life struck me as in some way alien. Yet the persistence, the courage of Per Hansa and the whole immigrant society did teach a lesson i.e. that the making of a new life in America would only be made through enduring and overcoming extraordinary hardships.The characters in this book are well- drawn, and there is a narrative that moves along if at times with difficulty.But to know a very special kind of American world and character this book is highly recommended."
4,Book club selection.,Our local book club decided to read and discuss this for December.I found the book slow-moving at times but well worth the effort!
3,"Okay, would recommend other books though.","...was kind of a depressing book. For those who like the action of story rather than focusing on the settlers' psychological issues, I would recommend reading Lauraine Snelling's books - Red River Valley series."
5,Follow Your Father's Advice,"For years, my father repeatedly urged me to read this book about the pioneer life of Norwegian immigrants. Although my father is from Texas and has no Norwegian roots, he read this book in high school and it apparently made quite an impact upon him. Moreover, my great-grandmother on my mother's side immigrated from Norway around 1900 and this gives me some insight into her experience. The author does an outstanding job of conveying the mental as well as the physical struggles that pioneer families faced in the 1870's. I never contemplated that the isolation of pioneer life could be so difficult. The book was a quick read after the first 50 or so pages, and I am now moving on to Peder Victorious. I am glad I finally followed my father's advice."
5,Good antenna,Good antenna I guess. This is my first CB/antenna setup so I don't have any fancy stats to provide.Be sure to tighten the allen screws holding the antenna into the bass very well and I'd recommend some lock-tight on the screws.The bottom covering got torn REALLY easy too but the antenna seems to be holding up good.
5,In the name of Iran,"This book contains colorfull images of castles, gardens, public baths, mosques and pictures from ancitent time of Iran to present time. Also, there were some pictures which they showed Iranian people are walking in parks because Iranian people ejnoy a lot walking in park, and spend time some where close by tree and enjoy shade and away from hot sun.This is a good book to have."
4,Rhode Island Roboin,"I got this quickly and am looking forward to using it, but have not needed it yet. I hope it will perform as expected."
3,JENNIFER RUBIN / SALLY KELLERMAN,"In this made-for-cable film, a sexy small-town girl (Jennifer Rubin) has high hopes to make it as a model in the big city. As she realizes her dreams, a deranged admirer murders her male friends one by one. (Co-starring M*A*S*H's Sally Kellerman.)"
4,Very comprehensive,"""Fields"" takes the reader from the dusty start of air travel in the southwest and transports him to the age where modern aircraft fill the sky in one of the most congested areas in the world. While working for Long Beach Airport, I contributed to that airport's story to this book and am proud to be a part of a work that brings history to life through vivid photographs and exciting stories."
2,DO WHAT?,"Okay, first they cut the hell out of the show when the put in on VHS and now they are cutting it even more on DVD. Where is Many Rivers To Cross, Tougher Than The Rest, Hold On, Take It To The Limit? I pray the tracklisting is an error and we will get the full concert on DVD."
2,Not your typical Cher show,"This is a DVD of a TV special. It's missing a couple of songs. My firs impressions of Cher were from seeing the Believe Tour on DVD and the Farewell tour twice in person and on DVD. This DVD is a step down. Granted, it's from 15 years ago (or so) when concert technology wasn't as cutting edge as it is today. I found this concert to be kind of a snoozer as far as a Cher show goes."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"Exquisite showcase of Cher and her talents. Looks great, sounds great. Five stars from this long term (33 year) fan. The Extra and Bonus offerings are fantastic with angle options and rehearsal options. It doesn't get any better tan this."
3,"VHS IS BETTER THAN DVD""",Have the VHS bought the DVD very dissapointed In the DVD.They Cut out a Lot Of the Show.WHY? Will return the DVD.Keep My VHS OF CHER At her Best.I love it. I only wish they would have made It like the VHS.Why make a DVD Incomplete of One of the Greatest Performers we Will ever See.The Name Is [ CHER ]
3,NOT THAT THRILLED,CONCERT WAS NOT THAT GREAT HER FAREWELL CONCERT IS ALOT BETTER THAN THIS ONE WAS. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN SORRY
5,BEST CONCERT EVER.,"IF YOU THOUGHT THAT ""THE FAREWELL TOUR"" WAS GORGEOUS, WHEN YOU SEE THIS REAL EXTRAVAGANZA, YOU'LL REALIZE YOU WERE WRONG. TAKEN FROM HER ""HEART OF STONE TOUR"" THIS CONCERT WAS FILMED AT THE MIRAGE IN LAS VEGAS IN THE LATE 80'S [ ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WAS RELEASED UNTIL 1992]. THIS VIDEO SHOWS CHER AT HER BEST, A SEXIER THAN EVER CHER...WEARING SOME OF HER MOST EMBLEMATIC OUTFITS [""BANG BANG"" - ""FOUND SOMEONE"" SET]. AND NOT JUST THAT...HER VOICE PERFORMANCE IS AWESOME! HER COREOGRAPHIES ROCK!SOMETHING VERY ATTRACTIVE IS THE FACT OF CHER SINGS SOME COVERS FROM HER FAVORITE GROUPS, AND SHE REALLY DOES WELL.AFTER WATCHING THIS DVD YOU'LL AGREE WITH ME; CHER IS THE GREATEST FEMALE ARTIST OF ALL TIMES."
4,"Good, but could be better.","I'd reccomend this book for those who know little or nothing about Paganism, but the more you know, the less usefull the book will be. Most of the information were things I already knew, but I enjoyed the book and found it a quick read, an enjoyable review. Not bad at all."
5,Educational,"I found this book to be a very pleasant suprize, I had no idea paganism involved so much of what I believe in. My life makes a lot more sense now after reading this."
2,Meh - mostly Wiccan,"I have two problems with this book: First, the writing is appealing to, possibly, a 5th grader. I mean really, a chapter on ""Please Don't Squeeze the Shaman""? Are you kidding? I do think the author is trying to be fun and playful, but it does not match the subject. Second, it is obviously Paganism through the lens of Wicca. I still struggle to find general books on Paganism that do not talk about the 4 elements, the three aspects of the Goddess, 8 sabbats, and other ""facts about Paganism"" that are obviously Wiccan. These are not accurate for those following the Norse or Celtic paths, and presenting it as ""Pagans do this or that"" is misleading."
2,Not very in depth,"Good for someone who knows absolutely nothing about paganism in general and has no idea which path they are interested in. Or good as a research tool for someone comparing different paths for a school project maybe. This book lightly touches on some paths (Druids, Wicca, etc.) but does not have much in depth info. From my little bit of research on the internet, I already knew that much or more about the different paths that the author mentioned."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this book knowing very little of Paganism. McColman did not give me a wonderful first impression of the religion. His book is comprised of what many Pagans would call ""fluffy bunny"" philosophy, as well as historical misinformation and the occasional bashing of monotheism as a way of making his own path look good. To anyone looking at this book to learn about the Pagan's spiritual path: avoid this one. It's oversimplified and has opinions and speculations presented as fact."
1,Cheap made product,"After getting tired of looking for batteries for our other sharpeners, I decided to look for a sharpener closer to what I used in school. Well this one is not it. After three uses, the entire collection cup just came off and would not go back on after adjusting every way imaginable. In order to sharpen a pencil, the cup must be on securely and ours was just flat out broken. Also the pad on the bottom of the unit was very loose upon opening but we were still able to make it suction to our granite. Don't waste your money on this cheap plastic."
1,barely works,"This thing would never stay suctioned down to any surface. So you are forced to hold the sharpener while trying to sharpen the pencil, and half the time it won't even sharpen them properly, it will just ""eat"" them. And then the plastic cover breaks. This happened to 2 different sharpeners. Find something that is better quality. it's not worth your time."
2,The un-stickable sharpener,I hate electric pencil sharpeners and asked my sister if she could pick me up a hand crank one like the wall mounted one we had as kids. She came home with this. It does not stick well to a surface and you are lucky if you get through sharpening one pencil without it popping off the surface. One fall to the ground (which is inevitable with little kids) and the cover cracked. Save your money and buy one that screws into the wall and just mount it in the laundry room or the garage or something if you don't want to mess up your desk area.
1,Broke After a Few Months,"I got this for my kids to use at home and for a few months it was a good little sharpener. Suction works well, not messy to dump out the shavings, etc. However, the teeth on the wheels grinded too much and stopped making the sharpening piece inside to turn."
2,X-Acto 1182 - Not a good purchase,"I second the reviews of V.Newman and cerbu.- Loose blade/handle design means the pencil is always sharpened off-center.- Suction base is not strong enough to keep the unit firmly attached, even if the surface is smooth and non-pourous, like a laminated desk top.- Our shavings receptacle broke apart after about 1.5 years.Two stars because for a limited time the sharpener gives a substandard, but usable, point to a pencil. I have sometimes resorted to using a pen knife to sharpen pencils rather than hassle with this X-acto sharpener. If you're looking for a good sharpener you can use for years look elsewhere."
1,Not worth buying,"First, this pencil sharpener only has one ""blade"" inside to sharpen the pencil. Without having a second, opposing blade inside, the pencil is always pushed away from the blade and sharpens off-center.Next, the vacuum base never stays put through even a single sharpening cycle.And the final straw, the other day, after having this for less than six months, the plastic shavings receptacle came apart (it's two pieces glued together), spewing sawdust and pencil graphite all over everything.I strongly recommend against this one."
3,"An ""ok"" sharpener","Bought this based on other positive reviews. It's sharp and stays stuck to smooth surfaces, but the down side is that it only has a single sharpening cartridge. This causes one side of the pencil to get sharpened correctly, but the other side still has wood left on the lead almost all the way to the tip. Also, it'll let you sharpen the pencil away to a nub if you don't stop to check progress.Fine for cheap or occasional use, but those two things are annoying to me."
1,Pick A Different Sharpener,"There are 3 major design flaws. One, it sharpens uneven about half the time. Two, the thing is not steady, and bends. Three, the vacuum does not hold for even 20 seconds. This thing is always falling off my desk. It's the worst sharpener I've ever had. Shame on you, X-Acto. I thought with a good brand name, it would be good quality, but I was wrong."
2,Works but not for long,"This worked great for us for about 10 months. My son sharpens all the pencils in the house every Monday, so we only use it about twice a week in all. This morning it refused to work and upon close examination we discovered that the METAL gears had stripped! The plastic parts have held up fine.So, I'm back to the drawing board on what kind of pencil sharpener to get..."
3,"Great, but not durable","This sharpener worked great while it lasted! The surface has to be very clean to get the suction to work well and needs re-suctioning after 2-3 pencils. It sharped many pencils and colored pencils evenly and to a nice point. After a few months, the plastic shaving receptacle broke, but was easily fixed with a little scotch tape. Overall the sharpener worked great for about a year and a half and then the gear inside just wore out and it became unusable. I expected it to last longer."
1,Cheap Chinese crap,"I bought it, looked at it and sent it back. 1st flaw: made in china 2nd flaw: the case is not mounted to the sharpener base so the uncentered tumbler knocks it off and it causes a huge distraction in class 3rd flaw: it doesn't sharpen worth a sht, what happened to quality?! Don't buy this foreign piece of crap"
4,Does the Job for Me,"I bought a pink model of this pencil sharpener more than two years at a back-to-school sale and have used it...a lot. I love the portability and it was a thrifty price ($7.95, I believe at that time), which is always important to me. That being said, I would also say it will not take the wear and tear of a regular schoolroom where a more expensive, permanently mounted, metal casing sharpener should be, but is great for the home or a small office. As for the vacuum mount, it works better if both surfaces are clean, and even a bit damp. This little sharpener is definitely is not a durable as I would like to be and the back of the plastic shavings holder did finally separate recently, but it also was easily mended with super glue, saving me from purchasing another one. I have noticed the gears are wearing some, but when they do finally wear beyond use, I would buy this same model in a heartbeat, because it is exactly what suits my needs."
3,Okay,It's a good sharpener but the suction is kinda weak. it only last as long as they are using it so it defeated the purpose of why I wanted it.
2,not as good as expected,I haven't found that this sharpener is as good as expected. It doesn't stay solidly 'stuck down' on the surface you put it on. I guess that's not so terribly bad...just a nuisance. It's not very stable.
2,Mediocre at best,"We bought this before buying an X-acto ""powerhouse"" model, and rated the powerhouse even lower. The vacuum works very well as long as you have clean, smooth countertop. But the rubberized base collects lint over time and diminishes the effect of the vacuum. After a while, even when we cleaned the base, it just didn't stick as well as it used to, making it virtually useless. As other posters mentioned, it sharpened unevenly as well."
3,X-ACto manual pencil sharpener,"Not the most derable of pencil sharpeners but does the trick better than the electric ones. Really sharpens pencils and fast. This is my second one, the last one I broke the back after emptying. The plastics parts could be a little more durable though. Over all I like it or I would not have bought another one."
1,worse than you ought to buy,"Like others here, I found that the plastic receptacle on this baby came apart and would NOT go back together. I was fortunate that the sharpener did actually sharpen pencils quite well and it lasted for at least a year if not a little longer. Still, the only reason it held up was that I didn't try to empty it until it was too full to go on any longer; when I did, uh oh. (Obviously the sharpener was not getting a lot of heavy use either or it would've needed emptying a lot sooner.)"
2,Not Good Enough,"I notice the reviews are at both extremes for this item. If you're happy that the thing sharpens your pencils better than the tiny toy things, then it's a 5. If you expected any kind of quality, it's a 1.I lean toward the negative on this one. Only epoxy would give you a reliable adhesion to even the smoothest surface. Two cutters would give the thing much better feel and balance. And yes, it is flimsy and would not last long with someone who was generally rough on things.I think I have one of the ""yesteryear"" models in a box somewhere, and I know it was better: metal, two cutters, screw it down to mount it - and you really had something.For a device that you'll keep, probably for a pretty long time, I'd prefer to spend several times the price and get a good 120 volt electric sharpener. If you've used these, you'll never go back."
4,Excellent for its worth,Use this as an OT with kids in school. Better suction on the new model. Still not made of metal excepet for the sharpener but a good bang for its buck.
4,for the price and quality not bad!,if your looking for a pencil sharpener that works good and is safe around the house can't go wrong. plastic seems fragile but you can't complain for the price.
4,"Great portablilty, ok sharpener","The vacuum for this item is actually fantastic. Turn the lever and this sharpener adheres to my counters like a screwed in model... however the sharpener, while easy to turn does tend to leave a small area unshaven. this is can usually be remedied by allowing the pencil to turn as you sharpen but not always. I don't regret buying this model, but given the chance again i would get a model with 2 fixed sharpener blades inside rather than the one rotating blade."
1,vacuum nice; everything else worthless,"Why, oh why, did I think buying a plastic pencil sharpener was a good idea? Oh yes, it was because there was no metal vacuum-mount sharpener on amazon.Plastic breaks easily and quickly. The really sad thing is that after I glued the trashy plastic back together, the metal sharpener assembly broke! Do yourself a favor and buy the good old all-metal sharpener you had in your classroom when you were a kid. They do not break. This vacuum mount is handy, but that does you no good when the sharpener itself is broken."
3,Little more than a journalist's rambling memoirs,"If you are looking for a biography of Queen Elizabeth II, don't bother with this book which is little more than rambling reminiscences of some of the Queen's experiences. Poorly written - one jumps from one topic to another without any sense of continuity, and there are annoying grammatical flaws - the book focuses rather narrowly on the author's experiences as a journalist covering certain royal tours. Rather shockingly, she also uses unwarranted and inappropriately derogatory adjectives to describe certain people. Anecdotes are fun, the photos are nice, but this book could have been much better. Review is based on the hardback edition."
2,Not interesting,"Since the item arrived in a very damaged box with a label explaining that ""item was checked and appeared in great working condition"", which it did so I gave it high marks for durability. However for overall entertainment-toy is lame. Really simple and not captivating at least for my child who loves most Chicco items. I would suggest investing in something a little more entertaining (other then realizing that it must be a well made toy due to the condition in which packaged arrived)."
2,Disappointing,"The review from Booklist promises much. All the subjects mentioned in the review are indeed there, but somehow the author managed to make them much less interesting than they could be. Maybe it really is SOMETIMES funny, but I'd rather read Irvine Welsh's Acid House or Ecstasy."
1,this player [stinks],"This player is great for DVDs, unfortunately I bought the player for its 5 disc cdr/mp3 playability. The player makes 2 second jumps on every song of every cdr I own. I took it in to get fixed. When I got it back, I plugged it in and still does the same thing."
2,"Good picture, overall quality poor","I have had this DVD player for 15 Months. About 3 MOnths ago, it started to take to skipping. It does not happen on all DVDs, but most. Usually it takes about 30-40 Minutes, and then you have to turn the playe off and on to get it to stop if you are lucky. Also, it sometimes does not read DVDs in the tray. Pretty poor in my opinion.That being said, the one positive I will give it is that the Picture is really nice. I don't know that I would buy a Toshiba DVD player again."
1,It was great until it stopped working,"A couple of months into owning this DVD player, it started to skip on some DVD's. Eventually it got bad enough to where it wouldn't play any disc's at all, it only gives me an error on the front saying ""disc error"" even with brand new dvd's.doh!"
3,Nice but not great,"I got this Toshiba SD3755 for about 2 months now. I won't go into the spec of this unit but I will note its bad points.1) It powers up very slowly (about 10 seconds) so be patient and don't press the power button twice. I did because when the power button is pressed...nothing seems to happen for awhile then your patience runs out.2) Changing a from one DVD to another is also very slow compare to Pioneer DV-C503 that I have.3) No direct access to DVD so you must use the to scroll through dics after dics to get to the one you want.4) For a PROGRESSIVE SCAN player, the picture is almost worse than the regular DVD player that I have.5) All buttons on the unit feel cheap. You know what I mean when you push the button and it feels cheaply made.6) Forwarding speed is only X2.7) Would I bought it again if I have a second chance? No."
1,PIece of junk,This is the worse piece of junk. Stick with brand name instruments. You get what you pay for has never been more true.
2,No Value for Money,"I bought both the Axion AXN-9700 7-Inch Widescreen LCD Digital Picture Frame and Coby DP772 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player in the same time.Comparing it to Copy its just not the value for money, the colours arent that good so if you want to put the frame on a desk or table the people around wont have a good luck unless they take it and stare at it to realize whats the pic. about.in summary you dont want to spend this money on something not that value.try other brands i suggest"
2,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"I got this a couple of days before Christmas and found it did not come with a remote. I was also VERY dissatified with the unit not havining the USB ports.It works nice with black and white photos after resizing. Microsoft has a nice FREE resizer.Overall for the money I guess it is a good buy if you know what to expect. If I had it to do over I would pay a little more for a unit that had all that I wanted...I guess MOMMA was right, You get what you pay for..."
2,Misleading Picture,"I ordered this digital frame for a friend of mine for Christmas specifically because the brown color shown in on Amazon web site photo matches color of her furniture. There was no other color option when I placed the order so I was sure that brown was the only available color. However, the one shipped to me was in black. When I called the company that sold the item via Amazon, I was told that the long retired old model was only in brown color and the new model is only in black. Since black doesn't match my friend's furniture color, I have to return it. I wish that Amazon had updated the product photo and description to reflect it's actual features so that I would not waste my time ordering and returning the item with incorrect color."
2,Directions are horrible,"1 tiny page of instrustions, printed on just one side. Very frustrating.Also, as another reviewer pointed out, you cannont connect this to your pc.....only a thumbdrive. There is no software included with the frame.This screen is nice and big, but overall its been a frustrating experience."
3,An ok picture fram,"I ordered this picture frame for my mom as a gift for mothers day. It's a decent size screen but if your looking at it from an angle the picture is either blurry or dark, that is just one down fall, the other is you have to put your disk card from your camera to play the pictures their is no internal memory to download pics to, So you lose your card for taking pics.. Anyway I wasted my money on this item because my mom hardly uses it for that reason she only has one card for her camera..."
1,Stay away,"I have been very disappointed in this frame. The display is dim and blurry. This frame has taken my 8 megapixel photos and made them look like old grainy photos. The aspect ratio is wrong which means that you are not getting the benefit of a 9"" screen unless you crop every picture. If you display them straight from the camera, you lose an inch on each side due to the aspect ratio. At least it doesn't stretch them to fit and therby distort the image but the screen doesn't have the correct resolution for pictures."
3,"Electronics are good, but frame looks cheap","I bought this and a family member gave it to my mom as a Christmas present. The item itself works just fine. Nothing exceptional about the picture quality, but also nothing to complain about. Does have a remote which was a must. It doesn't support a wide range of memory card formats, but it does the most popular one (SD).My biggest complaint is that the frame looks very cheap. For that kind of money, they could have at least put a decent looking frame around the screen. I was a little embarrased to give this since it looked so cheap. If it wasn't that it was a last minute gift, I would have shopped around a little more and possibly sent it back.This sounds like a horrible review, but I was just very disappointed in the frame. Of all that I have seen in the stores (and almost all stores sold these since they were a hot item this Christmas) this by far looked the cheapest."
3,"Low res, low price.","The concept of a digital picture frame is great. You don't need a computer, you don't need to squint at the postage size viewer on your digital camera, just sit back and watch your slide show. I thought it would be a great gift for my technology challenged mother.The Axion AXN-9700 is a good start. It doesn't match the resolution of even a poor quality film photograph, and this unit is overly difficult to operate for anything but the standard slideshow. But, it did capture the attention of everybody at the Mother's Day dinner. I guess I got what I paid for."
2,Not as advertised,"Ordered two of these as gifts - expected to easily be able to transfer pictures from my computer to frame since it was advertised as coming with a USB port adapter. Not so. The adaptor included is not a USB standard size but for a flash file. Also, one of the two boxes arrived with no adaptor at all."
2,Not what I expected,After a lot of agonizing over which digital frame to get I chose this one. I guess its OK but it isn't what I expected it to be. For one thing it didn't come with any instructions or info on how to set up the photo's on the memory card or how to put some of them into it's limited internal memory. I read reviews that said it would show several 100 to 1000's of photos on one 512mg SD card. I cant get it to show more than about 120 photos and only those on the card that are not in a folder and only in one long slide show. I cant get it to show anything in separate folders or sub-folders. As for the mp3 playing I haven't tried that yet.Picture quality is OK and it only takes extra time to load them if they are very large. If you re-size them for the size of the screen they load OK. Overall I'm disappointed in it for what it cost me. But I guess that we aren't supposed to want very much out of something that's a little over $100 any more.
5,"Nice, simple, easy-to-use digital frame","This is NOT a high-tech digital frame. It doesn't play MP3's. It doesn't come with a remote. It simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode. There's an ""on"" button and an ""off"" button. There is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame (though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet). It's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off. If you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location, or choreograph your pictures with music, then this is not the frame for you."
2,Disappointed,"Just opened to get ready for christmas and was disaapointed. No remote, as discribed, no instructions to get the pictures to fit ""full"" frame. RETURNING this frame. Went and got a similar frame for 10.00 more and just put the SD card in and I had to do nothing. A review below tells you how to size your photos, but what a hassle. This frame will be my first return to Amzaon after many purchases."
2,The original description was inaccurate,"I bought this for my wife at Christmas after doing a search for frames with a USB port so that she could load some of the pictures that she has stored on her laptop. The original description said it came with a remote and the port, actually it came with neither. All in all the picture quality is decent for the price, the flash storage is something that you usually don't find on frames in this range, and now I see that I wasn't the only person taken in by false advertising."
1,Disappointment when it only displayed pictures once,"yes it displayed all of the pictures once, in a wide format that is not very high and is a bit grainy. I have owned a Philips from several years ago that had a much superior display. Then the real disappointment: it showed all of the pictures once, said it was ""loading"" and then: nothing. cycling the power, re-inserting the SD chip, nothing helped. Many happy returns."
4,Digital Frame,This product was shipped and received quickly and in good shape. The product works easily and as described. The only downside is high-res photos look blurry. Low-res actually work better.
4,"Good price, good image, easy to use","This is my 2nd frame. The first one requires to edit the pictures taken from camera to fill the screen. This one, with a standard resolution of 640x480, you just select a resizing to a 20x25 640 pixels in Picasa and voilá!!.Cons: Play only MPEG videos. Videos taken from Canon Camera can't be played on it."
1,Do not buy this to give as a gift!!,"When you load it up with pictures, choose you custom settings, and give it to your granny... You will find that your custom settings are forgotten every time it is unplugged. This is inexcusable!"
3,I've bought better!,The display is just above average but the frame they could have done a lot better. It's like a plastic cheapo frame covered with a woodgrain sticker over the top of it. Instead of accenting the picture it tends to take away from it.
3,Not very pleased with purchase,"For those that are buying for the digitally challenged, it is a good purchase for the price. However, I was not very happy. I found other frames that were very comparable in price that came with many more bells and whistles (interchangeable frames, holds more than 20 pictures internally, loads pictures much faster, etc).On a more positive note, I did rate it 3 stars because it is pretty and very easy to use."
3,One of the best of the bunch,"In trying to find a digital picture frame for my parents, I found my self overwhelmed with options and misinformation. I finally decided on this one (mostly because of another amazon reviewer) and I feel I made the right choice.As long as you put your images into separate folders, each containing 500 or less images it will show thousands of images.I only tried out the Mp3 playing feature when I first opened it, but really never use it. It seems to me that it would become annoying very quickly.Finally after a Summer of my parents enjoying it. My Aunt asked me to get her the same one. That's what this review is from, my second purchase of this item... as far as I can tell she is happy with it too."
1,Waste of Money,The product was very poor quality. The refresh of the pictures was very slow and not worth it. I had to return it - it was a gift and was going to be embarrassed.I have since bought a Kodak and liked it very much -the idea is good however this is not the frame to buy.
5,One of the best on the market,"If your looking for a realistic golf game, this is my favorate and most likely will become one of yours. Sure there are some bugs but Sierra has patches that fixed the initial problems I had(one of the reasons I love Serria games). The ability to make your own courses is both fun and challening. The ability to compete in single payler seasons is great fun for single palers. The graphics are great and play is smooth."
5,Championship Golf2000,"Fantastic game, computer graphics outstanding. True swing, I've found"" THE BEST"" Closest to the real thing.I can't get enough. Just ask my wife!! I'm happy to report I shot a 13 under on your Coeur d' Alene Resort Golf Course Sierra keep up the good work!!!"
4,Truth or Fact,"In today's world where ""facts"" are where you find them, and anyone can post a ""fact"" on Wikipedia, this book is a plethora of information and makes one consider exactly what the facts are, might be, could be and how they may not really be factual.. Like a Bill Bryson read, there is more than facts about facts in this book, lots of interesting tidbits surrounding the culture of facts."
3,Works only with large doses,"I have used many brands of HCL as I have to take it prior to eating in order to avoid severe stomach pain. I picked up the Solaray recently when my go-to brand was out of stock. While it does work (it is HCL, after all) you don't get much bang for your buck. While I only take 2 pills of my go-to brand before each meal, I had to take at least 5 Solaray capsules to get similar results. It would probably be a good choice if you need a low dosage of HCL, but if you are like me and need around 1200mg with each meal, this is not the economical choice."
3,Not as effective as I had hoped,I have always loved Solaray products and thought I would be able to use only one cap per meal because it was twice the potency of a different company's HCL/Pepsin which I had been taking. But instead I had to take 3 to 4 Solaray caps to get the same results. I have purchased the original HCL/Pepsin product to make sure my comparison is accurate and then I'll decide which one I will continue taking.
4,HCI w/pepsin,"This product arrived quickly in perfect packaging. I believe it is a great product for digestive support. I certainly recommend it to anyone who cares about his/her haelth, and I recommend this company!"
1,smells awful,"I have used this in the past, but they changed the formula or (country making it?) and the gelatin capsules now smell like rancid pig hooves. I threw it away."
1,"This is just ""Chapter 1"" in a $300 set","Tony does make some interesting points (which by the way have nothing to do with time management but life management), but I can buy an entire audiobook for half the price. So 4 stars for ""chapter 1"", but -3 stars because this is an overpriced teaser for the full $300 set and no disclaimer that's all this is. You do get a discount for converting, but that's more than I care to spend especially after being had."
4,Time of Your Life - by Anthony Robbins,"Tony really motivates me. He gives great principle for how to lead your life through the everyday struggles that when known about,you can avoid and lead a successful, fullfilling life."
1,Compatibility issues,"It appears that the Netgear MA401 802.11b Wireless PC Card will not work with this network adapter.Belkin's site claims:Q: Can the Wireless PCI Card Adapter be used with any other PCMCIA or CardBus adapter cards?A: No, the Wireless PCI Card Adapter F5D6000 will only work with and was only designed to work with the Wireless Notebook Network Card F5D6020. Using other PCMCIA or CardBus adapter cards will not work."
1,Terrible product,This is a terrible product. I have had the device not working error (10) and have tried every configuration. Buy something else and not Belkin networking.
3,Very picky,"Well, I bought this thing knowing that I had a version 1 Belkin PCMCIA card. I installed the PCI card and STILL got an error signal. IT turns out that EVEN among the Version 1 PCMCIA cards, there are some that will not function with the PCI adapter. Supposedly, Belkin labeled some wrong and some nonfunctional ones got mixed into the batch. Although it took forever to get a solution from Tech Support, they were nice enough to send me a brand new PCMCIA card that WOULD work with the PCI adapter. Perhaps my only suggestion with this product and any PCMCIA to PCI adapter is to do your research VERY IN DEPTH, because in this case you have to cross the T's and dot the I's to know for sure that this product will work!"
1,Belkin is a poor excuse for networking,"This product is not compatible with windows XP even though it says it is. Their customer support is horrible they have no idea what thay are saying, they cannot speak engligh, they do not know anything about their own products. they will give you a run-a-around if you call them and they will blame you for the product not working. They hung up on me several times. Very Very Very Very VERY RUDE! If you can at all avoid belkin, please do."
5,Nine beautiful samplers - discontinued book!,"This book contains the following sampler patterns:1.) Harvest Sampler2.) Camelot Sampler3.) Fantasy Sampler4.) English Cottage Sampler5.) English Garden Sampler6.) Birth Announcement7.) Christmas Sampler8.) Wedding Sampler9.) Heart SamplerThe thing I like about this book in particular is that the charts are two-colored (black-and-white with red details). This makes them much easier to read than some of Ms. Wentzler's other patterns. The designs are very intricate and will probably take some time to complete, but they will be worth the effort!This book is discontinued and has been for quite some time, so if you are set on stitching one of the patterns in it and would like it in a book form (individual patterns are still available for download and print-at-home through Ms. Wentzler's website), then you should probably buy this book sooner rather than later."
2,Ok but not for your first Washington biography,The author covers a lot of ground in a very limited number of pages. The result is a lack of a general biographical sketch of Washington. I would agree with other reviews that a more comprehensive biography would be a better choice for a first read on Washington.
5,Brookhiser Hits a New Level,"Brookhiser has done two things here. First, he has contributed to our understanding of our first president, who for so many has become just a face on a quarter, or a hairdo on a one dollar bill. George Washington was so big, that his legacy can handle many more books. This book serves as an incisive thematic essay, grounded in the perspective of fathering, and fathering a whole country. The fact that Washington never fathered any of his own children makes this more interesting.Second, we have here a new, more serious Brookhiser, shown by his subsequent biography of Alexander Hamilton. Brookhiser cut his teeth writing for National Review, and wrote some incredibly perceptive essays on the Republican primary contestants in 1980. The good news is that he has deepened as a writer, and now shows that he can also research back in time.This book reads fast, but sinks deep. Buy it, read it."
1,Nothing new,"It is puzzling why someone would be motivated to write a book on Washington with nothing new to offer. After reading the great Washington biographies by Hughes, Freeman, Flexner, and Cunliffe (and the quaint ones by Irving and Sawyer), I found this just rehashing old stuff with no particular style."
3,Probably not worth your time,"This book was a fast little read and was mildly enjoyable. I didn't really gain any knowledge or special insight into Washington though. I learned more about Washington from reading Chernow's Hamilton bio. If you know absolutely nothing about Washington, this might be an OK starting point to get a feel for his character, if not much knowledge of his actual life."
1,Absolute [junk],"There is no structure, logic or historical context to any of his material. It rambles all over the place skipping from one subject to another in the same paragraph. If you like reading an editorial version of history you will love this book. This book is incredibly shallow and my evaluation of this book is that it is absolute [junk]."
4,"This book brings Washington, the man, into perspective.","Unfortunately, George Washington, the soldier and politician has been deified by our culture. Richard Brookhiser's tribute to our first president does a terrific job putting Washington's great accomplishments into their proper perspective. This book is must reading for those American history buffs who long to better understand the realities of life in revolutionary times"
3,A fair assessment of a more than fair Hero,"This book is a two afternoon read. It gives a good story of Washington as America's first true hero. It is not a great historical biography. The portion on Washington's morals is good, but is more philosophical and religious than historical. If you really want to learn about Washington, pick up Douglas Southall Freeman's pulitzer winning work (the abridgement is best unless you have a whole year to do nothing but read!)"
3,A short volume on our greatest citizen,"A short telling of the life of George Washington. Brookhiser's writing is difficult to find an audience. He writes short biographies that gloss over and mention items that are not readily understood by those new to the subject. At the same time, those who are knowledgeable on the subject will find the books lacking detail and not enjoy the book as well. This book on George Washington is no exception. The book is well written, but difficult to read because of the information that is packed into this 200+ page volume. One must pay excruciating detail to the book to not miss anything. Not until reading Flexner's ""George Washington-The Indispensable Man"", did I feel I understood enough about our first President. This book is a good short primer for those not really interested in in-depth study."
4,Enjoyable,"Richard Brookhiser's, ""Founding Father"" is a well written informative, most enjoyable look at the life of George Washington. It gives Washington's military and political history as well as discussing his moral values and ideals. It does not go into his family life which I find regrettable. How a man raises his kids or in Washington's case his step kids is extremely important. Especially since he is the father of our country. For this reason I gave the book four stars. Overall, for a short book on Washington it is definitely worth reading."
5,Incredible,"On Peter Gabriel 3 Gabriel fully abandoned his Prog Rock past but came up with a dissonant and disturbing masterpiece which also featured world music suiting his soulfull voice. Gabriel writes all the lyrics without a single cowritter for the first time and he also plays instruments on all but one of the songs which add to the albums appeal. Gabriels songwritings incredible particularly on the scairy Intruder, No Self Control, the menacing (ballad!) Family Snapshot and the haunting Biko. This album also earns kudos for featuring Gabriels only studio album instrumental, Start."
4,"Expected a 5 star cd from Peter, but i got a 4","If this was an album by NSync I'd be very impressed. But this is Peter Gabriel, the genius behind Genesis. The man who wrote the ""The return of the Giant Hogweed"" and probably the jist of the material on ""SElling England by the Pound"". So when I heard Peter GAbreil (3) i was a little dissapointed. He displays good lyrical content but i found the music to be dry and less than amazing. I like the songs ""Game without Frontiers"", ""No Self Control"", ""Biko"", and ""Family Snapshot"" but it wasn't the same type of liking as you do with his Genesis songs. The type of liking where you say to yourself, ""Now i got to get all his cd's"". I think this album is worth hearing never the less, but it won't be an ""experience"", just a plesant day in the park."
2,Weak...,"...Sorry, guys, I think that the cover says it all. Totally out of focus and falling apart. I much prefer his later work."
3,WYSI NOT WYG,"OK, first off, this is an ATA-5 drive, and IBM has an ATA-6 drive which several sites have for about (+ ~ 10%) the same as this. ATA-6 will run at burst rate of 133 MB/sec.But hold on...let's talk more about this drive.It is easy to install -- like any HD, put into the cage, screw in, attach slave mid-clip from IDE cable + power mid-clip -- and off you go.But I did this and the speed is dreadful when checked by several tools (e.g., Sisoft Sandra) as well as my own ability to just see how slow my machine became.Problem is likely that you'll need a Promise IDE car to support ATA-5/100, even if your BIOS or O/S (mine's XP Pro) indicates it knows it's an ATA-5/100 drive.So, know what you're getting (last year's hard drive) and that you might need to [spend some more money] for a new card as well."
1,Very High Failure Rating,"I don't recommend this drive to anyone. The failures are extremely high with the GXP series. I have had mine for six months and it is starting to fail. It is still under warranty, but I do not want another IBM. I have decided to purchase either a Maxtor or Seagate for a replacement. IF you are currently using this drive, back up your data and get a new non IBM GXP drive. Thanks to IBM, I have 45GB of data to try and salvage."
5,Centering Prayer,This book inspired and thrilled me. It teaches a simple yet ancient way to go deeper in ones prayer time. Certainly not easy but well worth the effort. Pennington is a brilliant writer and guide in this process. It is a hard book to put down I just wanted to keep reading. Read it and your prayer and meditation will be changed forever. It will be richer and more rewarding.
2,This radio looks good... but that's as far as it goes.,"The radio looks good and has nice features, but there is a problem that cannot be overcome.You have to press the PTT button for at least 2 seconds before talking. Why? The PTT button is a dual-function button. Obviously it is a PTT, but it is also a Monitor button. This makes it necessary to hold it down for at least 2 seconds before talking. Getting people to realize this and have them remember to do this is next to impossible.This made the radio very frustrating to use. I eventually sent them back for a refund."
3,good reception but extras don't work with frs on,"I looked at the Motorola 6310 and this Uniden 440 because they both have weather channels and FM radio and other similar extras. I chose this one because it was half the price of the Motorola. Unfortunately you can have FM or FRS but not both. On the Motorola the FM will be interrupted by a FRS transmission so you can have the best of both worlds. Also the call button gets hit accidentally very easily, so it's hard to tell when someone is really trying to call you or not. I have a Motorola 6200 that has recessed buttons and haven't had any false calls with it. I think I'll return the Uniden and get the Motorola 6310 or 6320 after all."
1,Hardware may be ok..,"...but who knows, because software & manual ABSOLUTELY is worth nothing, the people who've written the la-la-la happy comments above are either 1) employed at Belkin, 2) fortunenate enough to have a configuration of Win XP/2000/98 that by chance worked with the dreadful driver & configuratin software or 3) have probably learned by now that this product is, to a degree rarely seen, a piece of c++p!!!"
4,"after update, works flawlessly XP DRIVER",i must admit it gave me the headaches at the beginning.. but then i read that there was an XP Driver on Belkin's website.. so I downloaded and installed it IT WORKS!!!!!!!!....Try it...
1,Sporadic Connectivity,"One word: Junk. Card would only maintain connection with my D-Link DWL-1000 WAP for a few minutes before suddenly losing signal. Signal strength fluctuated between 20% and 45% and signal quality was always decent...but just coudn't maintain a continuous conversation with the WAP. Every couple mins I would get a message on my screen saying the ""Wireless Access Point could not be found."" When I plugged my D-Link wireless notebook card back in, it worked perfectly...same signal strength, but it never lost the connection. BTW, also bought a Belkin USB wireless adaptor for an old Win98 machine and the installation CD was practically useless. Had to install drivers manually (and even that wasn't straightforward); luckily I know a bit about PC's. A novice would have been completely stumped. Overall, I am not impressed with Belkin at all. Will stick to D-Link."
2,Card works fine with non-Belkin driver,"After hours of trying to get this card (version 1) to work with my win2000 laptop I finally in a desperate attempt installed the driver for the Compaq WL100, which is also based on the PRISM-2 chip set. To my astonishment it WORKED !! For the first time my card connected to the access point. After this I could use the Belkin configuration utility to configure wep etc. Moral of the story: do not use the Belkin driver and things will work out fine. Thumbs up for compaq, definite thumbs down for Belkin ..."
3,"Didn't work in WinXP, but it's fine otherwise","As other reviewers have noted, this card does not play well with Windows XP.Specifically, it gave me an obscure ""file not found"" error when I tried to install the drivers on the included CD. I got the same error when I attempted to install the updated WinXP-specific drivers that I'd downloaded from Belkin's Web site.For the record, this card *does* work fine on my Windows 2000 and Red Hat 8 partitions."
3,Works good..... but I have a couple complaints.,"Problem #1 - XP doesn't have drivers for this card and the manual included doesnt have XP setup instructions, so I had plugged in the card and ran the setup disc. The card didn't work. After removing everything and going to the Belkin website for XP setup instructions, my second install attempt was successful.Problem #2 - When I travel, I like to see all available wireless networks and connect to unencrypted ones to use the internet. With the software provided, you must know the network name you want to connect to and enter it in the software program. I think that sucks."
1,This movie would be better left alone...,"The one page ad in Revolver mag made this movie sound great. The dvd cover boasted ""...makes 'Kids' look like an after-school special."" No ultraviolence as stated, just line after line of obscenities. This movie is not comparable to 'Kids'. This movie will go to the DVD trader as soon as possible. You want some vulger stuff go watch 'Meet the Feebles' or 'Requiem for a Dream', not this poop made by kids in their late teens and early twenties."
5,I WANT THIS IN AUDIO FORMAT!,"I love this story. I have it in audio cassette format, but can't find it in CD or digital audio. This is a truly entertaining mystery set in feudal Japan. It's equal to ""Seven Samurai"" with only one Samurai. Reading it is good too, but listening to it is somehow - better."
1,"Keys Unresponsive, would not respond to keystrokes...","Received this keyboard today and was very dissapointed. I can't believe IBM actually allowed Micro Innovations to put their logo on this item. When typing, the keystrokes either were not recognized or would display seconds later. Receiver ""data"" light blinks showing that are you pressing keys, however, the keystrokes are not sent to the computer.Returning item now as I type on a good/working LOGITECH wireless RF keyboard."
5,Bringing Back The Past,"I remember this movie vividly from 1967 when it toured the art house circuit. Now it is available in an excellent transfer from Korea. Elvira Madigan tells the true story of a Danish tightrope artist and a Swedish army deserter whose brief romance ends abruptly. The film is notable for the beauty of the lead actors Pia Degermark and Thommy Berggren, the wonderful photography of the Swedish countryside near Karlberg Castle by Jorgen Persson and the haunting score based on the second movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto #21, which has ever since been referred to as ""Elvira Madigan"". The film is truly idyllic and one of the most beautiful films ever made. It will put a little romance in your life."
4,Tragic beauty,"This movie transported me back 40 years to when I first saw it. The artistic blend of fairytale photography, Mozart's music & the impossible position of two beautiful young lovers melds together to excite the senses and tug at the heart strings."
4,Hanky time,"One of the amazing things about Elvira Madigan is the timelessness of the piece, coupled with the films unique ability to emotionally drain the viewer. It is a simple romantic story that both young and old readily identify with.When I saw Elvira Madigan in 1966 at the Cameo Poly cinema in London, the capacity house was completely reduced to tears.Subsequently, as a teacher in the 70 & 80`s, I used the film as part of an 'A' level film studies course for worldly eighteen year old students - with the same moist eyed result.Now a senior university lecturer, I am about to submit my BSc degree students to the same emotional turmoil. I suspect that it will again be hankies all round.Sadly, as I understand it, the original prints were on a batch of Eastmancolor that faded back to just blues and reds. The BBC appears to have a copy, possibly on video, which was re-broadcast a couple of years ago. Let us hope that the publishers also re-issue soon for the next generation of wet eyes."
3,"Elvira dies, the yellow dress lives on!","Elvira Madigan may have not survived her summer of love, but her daffodil yellow dress obviously did. You know the dress I'm talking about? The one that she wore throghout the movie. She rolled in the grass in it, she soaked in the rain. But there is not a stain, not a wrinkle on her dress. It remains perfectly fresh and smooth.As for the love story, I can't say I was particularly moved. A sleazy soldier and a selfish showgirl - not exactly a sympathetic couple. But then again, I'm a cynical person, and I don't advocate ""free love"". When the two lovers killed themselves, I could only shrug my shoulders. Selfish romantics are usually self-destructive."
3,"Too beautiful to live, too beautiful to truly love","The film that launched a thousand copycat hairspray ads, and certainly more parodied than actually seen these days, Elvira Madigan is as light as a butterfly floating on the breeze - a beautiful to look at but short-lived tale of two doomed runaway lovers who, being Swedish, naturally end up committing suicide. Pia Degermark is beautiful, Thommy Berggren is a more beautiful Oskar Werner lookalike, the scenery is beautiful, the Mozart and Vivaldi soundtrack is beautiful, the photography is beautiful, the spilled wine that's the closest we get to seeing any blood is beautiful and even the one brief bit of vomiting onscreen isn't entirely ugly. It's pleasant enough and it's easy to understand its popularity, but it's too beautiful to truly love."
2,What's So Great About This Film?,"Well, yes, I had heard the name from back when the movie was new. I don't remember whether I was aware that it was a foreign film; I hate subtitles. It's a rather pretty movie, but slow paced. Not a lot actually happens. There's a lot of slow and thoughtful scenes of the couple Elvira and her lover, Sixten. And perhaps some of the little touches were meant to be symbolic in ways I do not understand. But frankly, I was pretty bored.Good music, though."
3,damaged in shipping,"Seems to work fine, and costs less than on the Cobra website. But: it was BENT DOUBLE to fit into a small box, and still has not fully straightended out."
2,Bad reception,"Do not have good radius with this antenna, may work well if your driving by a truck stop or something but not good if you want to talk to someone more then a mile away."
3,Add a good punch to any mobil handheld unit,"I pick up one of these at my local Frys with a BNC to Motorola adapter ($2.29) and as soon as I plugged in the ant. tossed it up on the roof of may van and said ""Breaker Break can anyone out there hear me"" I got a response ""NO! ha ha ha ha"". Yep I was in the CB game with my Midland Handheld unit and this ant.Worth the $20 to carry a better rang ant. then the ""Rubber Duck"" most handhelds come with.Not the best ant. out there but seem everybody carries it and it works pretty well.See Yall Later"
2,problems with the antenna,i had to order a SWR meter due to transmitting a ton of static when talking to other drivers. they said its extreamly statically and i sound like charlie browns teacher so i hope with getting a SWR meter this will fix the issue otherwise im going to get my money back. i will give this a 2 star rating only becuse for its size its pretty cheap
3,"Cobra antenna ""good""","Found an old CB radio in a box in the basement. Needed something to use to test. Order was received timely and in good condition. Antenna and radio both work, however, decided to spend a bit more and purchased a Wilson 1000. Wilson is a better antenna, but for the price, the Cobra works just fine. Will continue to use it for my other vehicles."
3,"Decent Antenna, purchased in a bundle",I have this antenna matched with the new cobra model 29 cb radio on my 08 Toyota Tundra. The reception is okay for the money but I'd look for other alternatives. If you need a get by antenna or just one for an old hunting truck its sufficient. I would recommend this product to someone who doesn't use a radio that often or travels using one in a rental car. The magnetic mount is strong for what it is and is easy to swap whole unit to another vehicle.
3,typical antenna for typical price,"Nothing special about this unit. I would have liked the insulating base to be of better material. I'm afraid that the thin silicon membrane will tear easily, and was better secured to the magnetic base. Removing the unit from your vehicle to clean or wax the vehicle, causes the membrane to detatch, and it's so thin, tearing may be an issue.Also, basic instructions on how to tune your antenna to your radio, using a SWR meter would have been good.It should be noted that you can pick up this exact antenna for the same price at any truck stop."
4,Mobile CB Users Beware,"Great antenna if your able to use the connector it has. i have a mobile cb radio, which does not have the same connector as a normal CB radio. So i needed to go out to radioshack and but a convertor to make it fit on my mobile CB radio. Once it fit the antenna worked great, just beware that you might need this convertor if your using a handheld unit."
2,not powerful enough.,I travel through the mountains each time I go to Florida. This antenna was not big enough to handle the hills and vallies.
1,"Ordered a used one, missing parts","Ordered the antenna and was missnig the bottom section of it to screw into the base. I was told I would could get a 20% discount since it's defected, but hows that going to help me if I can't use it. I would suggest spending that extra ten bucks and guarantee all of your parts. Just sharing my personal experience."
1,DOES NOT WORK,PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK COULD NOT GET RECEPTION EVEN BOUGHT GOOD ATTENA STILL COULD NOT CONNECT I THINK IT IS JUNK.
3,Not sure,So far i have not been able to transmit very far with this antennae. Am i missing somethingThe base and the overall construction of the antennae is decent. I like the long cord that allows me to feed the wire from the back hatch and reaching all the way to the driver seat.It's paired up with my Midland.I can certainly pick up a lot of stations but having problems transmitting. I have even tuned they antennae so it should be on spec.
4,works fine,"This unit is for my wife car, and she can get about 1/2 the range that my 12 ' whip does, but its easy and more stylish then this huge whip. (I love the look of the Whip) on my Truck but she likes the looks of this antenna on her NEW car. no holes being drilled and she flipped out seeing me cut a whole in the side of my trk to mount the whip. LOL.."
3,Cobra HG A 1500 Base-Load Medium Magnet Mount 300W CB Antenna by Cobra,"Received the antenna today and had to retuned it back because of missing parts. The part that attach the whip to the magnetic mount where the antenna screws in was missing, otherwise I would of give it a 4 stars. FYI, This is a three parts item (whip antenna, magnetic mount with cable, and screwablee antenna mount to the magnetic mount where the antenna adheres to + the allen key to adjust the whip."
5,Awesome Antenna!,"Got this for my Jeep CherokeeNeeded an antenna to communicate with my buddies out in the desert and it works awesome!-Without a tune I get signal from a decent distance.-Mounted it square in the middle of my roof, and the magnet is more than capable of holding on.-Ran the cable along my headliner down to my dash and still had some slack in the cable.-Ive already hit trees and signs, this thing is tough!-The antenna screws off, so you can leave the base on wherever and remove the antenna if needed.This thing rocks! Easily worth more than the price listed."
1,incompatible,This antenna will not give an acceptable SWR match with the new Cobra 75 WX ST SoundTracker CB radio. I was forced to return to my old antenna.Wasted $56.00 plus tax for two to go with two new CB's.
4,A great antenna for smaller vehicles,"Right out of the box this antenna worked great. The SWR on channel 1 was about 1.2 and a little over 1.5 on channel 40. Some minor adjustments brought the SWR down to a hair under 1.5 on channel 40 which, for me at least, is perfectly fine. This antenna comes with a generous amount of coax which should work for most applications. The mount base has a seemingly flimsy rubber cover/pad that I'm a bit skeptical of but so far hasn't failed. Great antenna for the price."
5,Good Item,"Great value. It's true that the rubber base pad is as cheap as it could possibly be, but the antenna had an SWR of 1.1 to 1, right out of the box. Works great."
2,Poor Base Cover,The vinyl cover of the base is flimsy at best. Falls off and will get lost over time leaving bare metal magnet touching your paint.
1,"Great antenna, terrible packaging","I bought this antenna from Amazon since I had a bad experience with a cheaper CB antenna. It's been a couple of months since I bought my Midland CB radio and I couldn't get any signal. This antenna is great. The rubber at the magnetic mount is gentle to your car's roof and other surfaces. The BIG problem was the packaging. I bought this antenna using a courier service, and Amazon decided to package the tightly and flexibly packaged antenna in a HUGE box with more than 70% free space filled with paper. Outrageous. I was charged 500 USD just to get this box to my place since it was bigger than all of my other shipments together."
3,Filling in the biographical gaps,"This book is cobbled from pieces in a wide variety of magazines, reviews & little journals--with some chapters written for the book--so the point of view does vary.Fox's story follows her biography _Borrowed Finery_, which was amplified by the novel _The Western Coast_. _The Coldest Winter_ fills out the story of her beginnings as a writer & explores how she gained a foothold in the world. She explores the oppression of both the communist bloc & Franco's Spain, by talking about the people who crossed her wandering path.There are astonishing vignettes, such as seeing Winston Churchill in the street, drunk, being steered along by a group of men, while he is weeping & mascara runs down his face. (She later found that Churchill's lashes & brows were so pale that he always wore mascara in public.) There are many such stunning moments. It's a fast read, but worthwhile."
5,Fun book to read to kids,"This book had a good match between the story and the illustrations, and I could point out where all the characters were and what they were doing while reading along in the book. It was fun."
2,Steer clear of this bummer of a live one,"This dud of a live album finds the Stones phoning in fairly uninspiring renditions of songs at breakneck speed. Shattered loses its sleazy groove to the double time pace; Let Me Go feels like the throw-away track it was on Emotional Rescue. Only Under My Thumb, grossly underplayed in concert, and Going To a Go-Go are worth the price. Satisfaction sounds a lot better on Flashpoint as does Start Me Up. The must have live Stones albums still are Love You Live and Get Yer Ya Ya's Out. For die hard collectors only."
3,Ehhhhh............,"This cd displays the tension that would come close to obliterating the Stones in the Eighties. That's all I'll say about it (I'm trying not to be snide about Mick Taylor's ""stand-in""), but the one thing that shows how sloppily this cd/album was slapped together was that THIS WAS THE SECOND 'LIVE' ALBUM BY THE STONES THAT BEGAN WITH ""UNDER MY THUMB"" AND CLOSED WITH ""SATISFACTION."" Don't believe me? Check out ""Got Live If You Want It."""
2,"Far From Their Best, But Still Okay for Some","I can only recommend this for people who specifically want a live album from the 1981 tour and don't have the wherewithal to find or trade for free bootlegs. This is definitely not a good place to start if you are just beginning to build or replenish a Stones music collection. This recording just doesn't sound very good. There are several 1981 bootlegs floating around that actually sound better than this commercial release. If you want good live Stones albums, you must get Get Yer Ya Ya's Out and Love You Live. Got Live If You Want It is also fun to listen to because you can really hear and feel the hysteria of their early 1960s UK fans. The Four Flicks DVD set from their 2003 concerts is also better and a good value. If you still have enough money left over to buy this one, you can probably find a lot of secondhand copies or maybe start looking for bootlegs."
2,Okay,"A lot of these songs are from the concert they gave that was broadcast live on (now defunct) ON TV. I didn't have ON TV in 1981, but I listened to the simulcast on the radio. But I didn't know it was going to be on when I turned on the radio in my kitchen as I made dinner. I turned on the radio to here ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" playing. And I thought, THIS BAND IS DOING A TERRIBLE RENDITION OF A STONES' SONG. I didn't think the band was the Stones!! They sounded too terrible. But then half way through the song, I realized it WAS the Stones. Being a Stones freak, I taped the show, anyway. Then when STILL LIFE came out, I saw it was from the same show. And it had that flacid live feel I'd heard on the radio. Mick's voice sounds NOTHING like his voice on the studio albums. IT SOUNDS LIKE A DIFFERENT, AND NOT VERY GOOD, BAND. The Stones get really sloppy when they play live, and it drives me nuts. I really only like their studio albums. STILL LIFE shows why."
2,Still Born,"A lifeless live CD. The highlight is 20 Flight Rock. Outside of that, this is a very wealthy band going through the motions. This is possibly their worst live album ever, even more so than Got Live If You Want It."
3,Still Life,"Another Stones live album. This one has some tracks not included on any of the others on that long list, but it's still a mediocre live LP at best. Keith, Charlie, and Ronnie Wood are in good form throughout. Shattered really rocks and has that punk feel to it that was the inspiration for the song to begin with. The one thing that makes this album mediocre is the vocals. Listening to it, you can't get over the fact that Mick Jagger's voice sounds so God awful bad. It reminds me of The Allman Brothers ""Second Set"", in which an obviously liquored up Greg Allman sounds unrecognizable throughout."
3,"If I'd bought tickets for this concert, I would have been so pissed off","Wow. I'm a huge Stones fan and have virtually their entire library. This one probably gets played the least, even less than their other (mediocre) live albums. The Stones live collection really isn't that good (except for Get Your Ya-Yas Out!), and this is probably the worst entry. The playlist is a joke...I just can't believe paying Stone tix prices and only getting that selection of songs. And Mick just sounds so LAZY as he sings most of them. It's sloppy and uninspired.It's a disappointing entry. I have it because I wanted my collection complete. If you're more selective, just skip this one."
3,not a 20 degree bag,"It's definately not a 20 degree bag, as my son and I were freezing in 45-50 degree weather. The bag is fluffy, but the lining is a bit itchy if you're not wearing long pants/shirt. Roomy though."
1,zippers poor quality,"We got these off our wedding registry and were really excited because they look and feel nice and zip together to create a 2 person bag if you like. Our first camping trip, though, the area by the feet came unzipped in the middle of the night and the zippers have continuously snagged and caught while zipping or unzipping the sides. We'll be looking into returning them. Too bad, otherwise they would have been great for casual camping!"
3,Super Reader,"The A-Team are a bunch of commandos on the run. Shafted by their bosses, they go undercover, working as a team of troubleshooters/crime fighters, helping those who didn't have anyone else to turn to.A disguise artist, a muscle man, a crazy pilot, and a mastermind made up the team - Face, B.A. Baracus, Howling Mad Murdoch and Hannibal Smith.The first book introduces the team, etc."
5,The Sims Have Done It Again!!! :),"This game is the best! Not only do you get the awesome Superstar where you become famous, but you also get Vacation where your Sims can go on a lovely family vacation! When I got this game in the mail... Ohmigosh!!! Not only was it (and still is) a ton of fun, it also is really cheap and runs completely smoothly on my computer! I was not disappointed, and neither will you! As a review above stated: HAPPY SIMMING!!! ;)"
4,Brilliant on its own,"Yes it does help tremendously if you know the story of ""Chinatown"" before viewing,because the impact of the final scene here is devastating. However, Jack Nicholson does a monumental task of making the time and place feel just as right as the original, even though it is 14 years later. Even though the women characters have to contend with the ghost of Dunaway, both Msdeline Stowe and Meg Tilly are fine.....and also vastly underrated is the work by Harvey Keitel and Richard Farnsworth as a wolf in sheep's clothing. If you havent seen ""Chinatown"" this film will stand on its own, as enough exposition is given to follow the plot, but if you are an admirer or Polanski's classic, ""The Two Jakes"" is a remarkable acheivement in adding a solemn bookend to a tragic story."
2,It's All About The Script...And There Wasn't One,"CHINATOWN was and always will be one of my favorite movies.The shame of this sequel is that script never came together. In fact, I remember reading about the feud that ensued between Jack Nicholson and screenwriter Robert Towne over the production of this movie. Nicholson complained that Towne left town without finishing the script and actress Meg Tilley was quoted that she could remember feeling the heat from just-copied pages fresh from a copy machine having just been thrown together.The acting and directing are there...but the story is not.Big disappointment."
5,Excellent and highly under-rated sequel to Chinatown.,"Truly one of the most under rated movies of all time. It may not be quite as good as Chinatown, but hell, what is? An excellent movie in its own right and a worthy successor to one of the greatest movies of all time. Don't see until you've seen Chinatown tho!"
2,A Disastrous Sequel,"A disastrous sequel to Chinatown--- it's hard to believe that the same screenwriter wrote both movies. While Jack Nicholson does a credible job directing, the screenplay is a convoluted mess. This movie was justifiably panned when it came out."
3,Sanitized version?,"I saw this movie when it was first released, and there was a brief but much more ""explicit"" sex scene between Jack and Madeleine Stowe doing it doggy-style on the floor of his office. It's completely gone in the Special collector's Version. There's no way I could have a false memory of something like that, so why was it deleted from the DVD?"
4,GREAT FILM IN ITS OWN RIGHT,"""Two Jakes"" is no Polanski treat, yet it is somewhat unjustly compared to its epic predecessor (""Chinatown""). Watch the movie in its own right, and you will be amazed. Chinatown had a trademark Polanski stamp in its fluid narrative and its clever unfurling of clues (just in time for an emotionally explosive denouement) but that is precisely where ""Two Jakes"" errs. The plot is quite suspenseful but a trifle convoluted. Characters are more deeply examined. If you enjoy intrigue, ala LA COnfidential or Unusual Suspects, this flick is definitely worth your while. If you insist on comparing it to its prequel you may be disappointed. Jack is a terrific actor but his directorial mettle is alarming here as well. Highly recommended!"
2,What Was Jack Thinking?,"I'm sorry to be so out of step with most other reviewers here but this movie is simply awful. The screenplay is sub-standard, the story is unnecessarily convoluted, and even the editing seems to be slipshod. Why Jack Nicholson chose to direct this movie is the biggest mystery of all.Watch ""The Maltese Falcon"" instead."
1,Boring,"Just flat out boring. I tried to follow, but just couldn't.It was an attempt by the producers to impress me with the Los Angeles 1950's style atmosphere, and I'm just not impressed.Storyline was bad also.How's that for a short and sweet review. Unlike many reviews on Amazon, this one didn't take 20 minutes to think out and it told you what to expect right away.Time to move on."
3,Can murder or suicide ever be truly altruistic?,"This is the kid sister of Chinatown. She is not as clever or as pretty as her elder, but she raises the same question: Why do we go to Jack Nicholson movies anyway? There are many allusions to Chinatown and lots of characters to figure out how they fit in. Be careful and don't take it any more seriously than it takes itself and it is reasonably amusing."
2,Disappointing Sequel,"Lots of great actors labour with a terrible plot and dialogue that doesn't make sense. Chinatown was mysterious, it stayed with you for months afterward. Two Jakes is boring - it took three trys to sit through the whole movie. My question was - can I leave now and come back later?"
1,Spare yourself the agony and rent Chinatown instead,"This sequel to Chinatown must be one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. It is badly written, badly directed (by star Jack Nicholson), and contains bland performances by two of my favorite actors, Nicholson and Harvey Keitel.Spare yourself the agony of wasting 99 cents on renting this turkey and rent the masterpiece Chinatown instead."
3,Good for the price.,"For 60 bucks this is a good vest to try and see if weighted vests will work for you.It is one size fits all.It fits well and doesn't move around, but the arm holes are a little tight when reaching out in front. Otherwise the fit is ok.It is a little tough to put on loaded with weight.Not as comfortable as the X Vest, but it is 1/3 the price.If you know you want one and will use it, I suggest the X vest.But as I stated, this one is good to see if this type of exercise will work for you."
2,Not for me,"I'm 6', 155lbs. Bought this in hopes of increasing my vertical for volleyball. Rough edges left marks near my neck and elbows. Could not adjust the velcro straps to comfortably fit my body, had to buy own velcro to make it fit, and even then it was loose. I wouldn't suggest buying it."
1,Shapeless sack,"This is a shapeless sack with pockets. Absolutely no thought has gone into design. When you are carrying 40 lbs on you, distribution of weight becomes critical, else you are likely to end up with a major case of backache. Having used the vest a few times and each time spending the following day in bed, I can vouch that the manufacturer has spent no effort in designing the product. I have an Altius (20 lbs). What a wonderful vest!"
1,unsatisfied,I am very unsatisfied with this vest. It has torn on the sides multiple times and I have already had to alter it. It hangs down to much and pushes down on your pants. It is to bulky and can't be covered with a shirt. It desperately need strenghtened. I would never buy another one.
3,"Its cool and all, but...","It's a very simple product, so there isn't much to say. It's a weighted vest so that you can burn more calories and build up muscle while doing regular activities or going for a walk. There isn't a lot of room for error or excellence--it's a weight vest, and it works, thanks to gravity and biomechanics. There is one small problem: it's a black, nylon vest of pockets filled with orange packets--every time I go outside, I worry that people are going to think I'm wearing a suicide bomb vest."
5,good early grant,"cary shines and shows some innocence refined out in later work, plus a few great back flips! crisp dialog and charming story make it a winner."
4,great fun,"this is a great funny and warm comedy and love story, it is one you can see over and over, all the great stars in it and the lines it is all great."
5,Holiday,"Cary Grant is a working class man engaged to a daughter from a wealthy family. He doesn't fit in with her stuffy ways but infatuated with her beauty and class. Her sister is Katherine Hepburn, she can't stand her family's stuffing ways and obsession over wealth and class. Will Cary marry the sister? Or will he finally realize that Katherine is his true soulmate?"
5,Wonderful Movie,This is a surprising movie...the emotions you feel in this is surprising...after watching this for the first time several years ago I knew I had to have this --- so will anyone who sees this movie..a must have!
5,charming and a delight to see,I can't say anything bad about this movie. The movie was unpredictable and witty. Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant make a great team.
4,very entertaining but a little stagy,"This is a film version of a Philip Barry play, and like ""The Philadelphia Story"" (which he also wrote, and the film version of which also stars Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn) this movie has sparkling dialogue, memorable supporting characters, and occasional heavy-handed commentary. But it's very entertaining, and the leads and most of the supporting cast are great. Grant, in particular, manages to give a very effective and human performance in a role that could easily be a plot device, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon are a total hoot as the very unconventional friends of Grant."
5,Fun frolic,"Haven't heard of it? Ah well, maybe they lost it womewhere along the way - this movie is a bit underated. Taken in context it is hilariously funny and thoughtful. It's over the top in all ways, a total fantasy as old Hollywood did so well. Enjoy the cast, the silly lines, the acrobatics and the uncanny way this movie seems to just feel good without hitting you over the head with a goofy stick.Love it."
5,They don't make 'em like they used to,"Movies express a vision of how we see ourselves or how we would like to see ourselves in the time they were made. On the surface, Holiday is a lovely fluff comedy with two of the screen's greatest stars. It is very funny. The acrobatic Hepburn and Grant show off delightfully and, for my money, have a better chemistry than Hepburn and Tracy ever had. That said, there are more serious issues, even if they seem somewhat dreamy and hollywoodilistic (so to speak). Lew Ayers as the weak, drink addicted brother, is very touching. Edward Everett Horton and Ruth Donnelly all but steal the scenes they are in, and social-economic issues are dealt with with a deft and subtle hand. A classic screwball comedy, which should be seen in the context of You Can't Take it With You and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."
3,rating Holiday,"I am a huge fan of Katharine Hepburn. I was a little dissapointedwith this movie. It is not a bad movie, but not a whole lot wenton in this movie. She has done much better work, especially withCary Grant. They have great chemistry."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD!,"I'm sure in it's time this was a very good movie, but for me it took forever to get to the inevitable. The film is saved by good performances by Grant and Hepburn, but it's not enough to save this slow moving predictable romance movie. It's easy to love the idea that the young Grant has, of earning enough money to let him take some time off to see what he wants to do with his life as I have always tried to live my life in the same manner. Maybe I've seen so many films that this one just doesn't stand out?I viewed this movie which was included in a box set with four other Grant pictures, I can only hope I enjoy the other more than this one, but the DVD transfer is very good and there are some interesting extras, so if your a fan look for the Cary Grant Box set."
1,Communist Clap Trap,"This movie is dissappointing from start to finish. The only character in the whole thing who seems to have any sense is Mr. Seton, the old-ish looking 58 year old father of Linda, Julia, and Ned. The only other highlight of this communist, progressive piece of obvious propaganda is the fact that Cary Grant is very young and handsome, if you can get over his annoying, unconvincing personality and overall lack of social propriety.Thank you."
4,What's missing?,"After reading some reviews, I expected something marvelous. But ""Holiday"" seemed only good, not a match for (say) ""The Shop Around the Corner."" I have a feeling that humor is at its best when there is affection and respect for even the comic characters and villains. Am I expecting too much?"
5,One of the best romantic classic movies,What more could you want but a touching movie with bit of fun and good romantic. Tis a happy movie.
5,My All-Time Favorite Movie,"Wish I had had the chance to have seen HOLIDAY at one of those huge and majestic cinematic palaces of yesteryear. As soon as I saw it for the first time about 23 years ago on the small screen it fast became my favorite movie of all time. Absolutely underrated, this gem is a joy to see time and again. You'll fall in love with Hepburn and be captivated by the dialogue. Every scene will have you glued to your seat and you'll soon fall under its spell. The theme is timeless and the movie rises above any romantic comedy of then or now. Pure Magic . . . . not to be missed!"
2,Sewn irregular. Great color and soft.,"Soft, great color, easy wash. However, the top edge is sewn asa fold over edge and sewn irregular. Does not lay flat or straight. Has quite a big of stretch to it as though it has lycra. Fine for a kids room but not for a formal or guest room."
4,Where else are you going to get $15 Queen-size sheets?,"These sheets are the right price, and they are perfectly fine and holding up well so far. I'm sure there are better quality jersey knit sheets out there, but these are soft and comfy. Just beware the colors are not named accurately. I ordered sheets in ""eggplant,"" and what arrived were lilac/light purple. Nowhere near eggplant. Otherwise, I'm more than happy with this $15 sheet set. What a steal."
4,Like Wearing Your Favorite TShirt To Bed!!,"Even the color we liked and it's like a burnt orange/orangish brown color. It's SOOOOOOOO incredibly soft and comfortable and we are never overly hot nor overly cold.One neg, be sure to be CAREFUL with it, b/c making the bed, the corners can easily tear.. it's a bit on the delicate side.Denver"
2,some defects,Top sheet had 2 SMALL holes in the fabric. One pillowcase came open at the seam and I had to repair it. This is very common with this stretchy fabric and is no big deal to me considering how delicate jersey knit can be. Even with these minor defects I would buy again. Price can't be beat!
1,Cheap in every sense of the word,"I got these sheets in eggplant color. The color is like what's on the screen, and I was happy with both that and the softness. However, within one week of use, a number of little holes have appeared on one end of the sheets and all over, I can see that fuzzy nubby look beginning that appears far later on quality material, including other jersey. It's like a Swiss cheese look and doesn't bode well for the future durability of these sheets.I'm surprised because none of the other reviews indicate such a problem. So maybe it's just mine. But if I were to do it again, I'd go for some sheets at Target or Ross with a slightly higher thread count and close to the same price."
4,Comfortable and affordable,I like these sheets. They feel comfortable and soft when you sleep on them. My only concern is durability as they are extremely elastic and my experience with elastic sheets is that they tend to give out sooner.
3,Okay - I guess????,"Well, the material seems nice (we'll see after a few washings) and the color was fine. But the cutting and sewing has a lot to be desired. I'm guessing these are irregulars.The bottom sheet fit nicely and was generously made. The top one, however, was an unusual shape (not straight lines) and on top of that, we realized that it had been sewn the wrong way.The wide band usually on the top of the sheet has to be on the sides of the bed in order for it to be long enough to cover everything. It's not a huge deal. You just don't have the usual wide band near the pillows - it runs down the side of the bed.In all, for the price, I would likely buy them again for my own bed - but I'm very glad that I didn't give them as a gift!"
3,Clearance Special,"Like some others, I bought these on clearance for $8.99. For around $27 I got 3 sets, the Caramel, Light Green, and Lavendar. The green and lavendar look like easter egg colors, otherwise they are nice enough. The caramel is a nice color! We like these sheets, we have a really high pillow top mattress and they don't quite fit but we still use them tightly stretched. They are not deluxe! They are usable, just not the nicest quality sheets you'll ever own. What do you expect for $8.99? At this price I feel like I got a deal, but not sure if I would pay much more for them."
3,"Soft, but Cheap","I have owned these sheets for a couple of months.Pros: Very soft & comfortable like the softest t-shirt.Cons: There is no question jersey sheets are soft, but these particular sheets are thin, too stretchy and too big for a queen bed. They hang way way longer than any other queen sized sheets I have owned.I would buy jersey sheets again, but I would pay more for quality."
1,Good First Impression--Didn't Last,"While I loved the look and feel of these sheets when they arrived, they didn't last. After only a single washing, they developed small holes and a moderate amount of pilling.While these sheets may seem like a bargain, realize that they'll only last a few washings."
2,Not quite the quality I have had in the past,"I was really happy to find jersey knit sheets at Amazon and couldn't wait to receive them as my old set had worn out. Finding them at an incredible price, I ordered two sets! However, the quality of these jersey sheets were not the excellent quality I had bought several years ago at a wholesale warehouse. We are using them on our queen size bed, and love the feel of the soft jersey, but they do not retain their shape after you toss and turn on them a few times. I don't know how they will respond after they are washed again, but I do miss the heavier knit of my old worn out sheets."
1,"Cheap, and You Get What You Pay For","I bought this sheet set because it looked like a great deal. It wasn't. The sheets are very comfortable, but they developed several small holes after just one washing. The material is so thin that it barely keeps together. In order to maximize my investment, I'll sleep on them until they wear out completely, then I'll buy some that are not as cheap."
4,Nice sheets for the price,"I ordered these sheets to go along with a burgundy comforter set and they look awesome together! I love the feel of these sheets and they are warm on cooler nights, yet not hot on warm ones. They've washed up just fine for me and havent lost shape or faded in color. I would order these again!"
5,Wonderful buy,I plan on buying more. No they are not high end but they suffice. The color is perfect. I usually buy gold to match my comforter set but these match even better. I love these sheets.
4,these are t-shirt sheets!!!,"i was unaware that these are t-shirt sheets!! i wanted regular sheets. i feel like i can't move in t-shirt sheets...like they roll with me.anyway, i returned them.i gave them 4 stars b/c they seemed like really NICE t-shirt sheets, even though i didn't use them. they are a good price and they are very soft. however, the colors are a bit off. i ordered the ""eggplant"" and what i got looked like ""lilac"" to me! very light purple.other than that...if you like t-shirt sheets...then buy these!!"
2,Sage Sheet set,I was impressed with how quickly this product came. The sheets are a little thicker than what I expected and the cotton is not quite as soft. They are decent for the price but definitely not sheets you can use in the summer.
1,Sage Green Cotton Sheets,Product color did not match color represented on display. I ordered the Sage Green sheets and received more of a Pea-Green color. Item was returned.
3,you get what you pay for,"Well... it was in a poorer quality than I expected. The quality is not really ""deluxe"", but it does fit my mattress. I bought another flat sheet and just used the fitted sheet. It is so cheap that it doesn't worth returning, but I regretted that I bought 2 sets."
5,One of the best albums ever,"The album is a masterpiece by all aspects. It's not only about ""sledgehammer"", ""big time"" or ""don't give up"", which were massive chart hits in the 80s. It's the totality that hits you. Every song has its own value, which sums up as a unique experience.The depths and details of the arrangements can be experienced in this SACD format with a proper sound system. If you have a standard setup, I can not blame you that you couldn't find any difference with the CD version. It's so sad to see that this 2 channel SACD version is discountinued by the manufacturer."
4,I recommend a good stereo,"I'm only going to comment on the sound quality of the album. To sum it up, the remastered version is better than the original CD release. The overall recording is a tad bright for me with only mild improvements in the sound quality. Yes, everything is cleaner, including vocals, but you probably won't notice many more subtleties versus the original release. Bass levels have been boosted slightly so that if you have a set of good full range speakers you will not need a subwoofer. If you have a nice system (mine cost a few thousand) I think you will enjoy this re-issue. If you have a ""home theater in a box"" or convert the album to MP3 (or iTunes) I doubt that you will notice much difference."
5,One of His Greatest!,"Peter G. is my favorite singer, but a couple of his songs (like this is the picture) are kind of weird. Somes songs are really rock and rolly, others are quiet and slow. If you like Peter Gabriels other recordings, get this one!"
4,Mixed,"This is a remarkably uneven album, but nevertheless Gabriel's best. It alternates between dark, somber, intense atmospheres like ""Red Rain"" ""Don't Give Up"" and ""Mercy Street,"" and less successful shlock-techno-rock like ""Big Time"" and ""Sledgehammer."" Here and there are short odd numbers like ""We Do What We're Told"" and ""This Is The Picture,"" which wear out pretty quick. But ""In Your Eyes"" and ""That Voice Again"" are first rate."
5,So was one of the most influencial albums of the 80's,"This set of songs truly celebrates the romantic spirit of the arts. Gabriel's music is emotional, and his lyrics are from the heart. The music shows world-wide influence, and its complexity is unusual for being recorded in the 80's. In fact, ""Big Time"" and ""Sledgehammer"" provide a whitty comentary of the times without sacrificing the quality of the music. Kate Bush's voice is haunting in ""Don't Give Up,"" and you can't get enough the unbounded emotion from Youssou N'Dour in ""In Your Eyes."" Perhaps the best song on the album is often over- looked ""Red Rain."" Rarely does one have the opportunity to purchase a recording where at least seven of the nine songs could stand on their own as the premier song of an album. The recording is of the highest quality and is one which every serious music fan should add to their library."
5,SO its his best album,"Peter Gabriel hit his creative and commercial peak with ""So,"" the rare smash album that is as good as it was popular. ""Sledgehammer"" was a huge dance hit (and great video)and was followed up the charts by the superb ballad ""In Your Eyes,"" as well as by ""Red Rain,"" ""Mercy Street"" and ""Big Time."" All the other songs are strong as well. The only unfortunate thing about ""So"" is the realization that Peter Gabriel has released only one other pop oriented album (""Us"") in the fourteen years since."
4,One of the fine great albums of the '80's.,"""So"" which I got for Christmas in 1990 because I liked the sound of ""Sledgehammer"" and ""In Your Eyes"" that I heard off the radio, is one of my treasured albums. The way it begins, the smooth and soothing ""Red Rain"" is great enough, along with the equally fine-tuned ""Don't Give Up"" (also on the out-of-print compilation ""Earthrise-The Rainforest Album) and ""Mercy Street"". There are cool funky rock ballads as well, ""That Voice Again"" and ""Big Time"". The last two tracks are only fair and so-so however. In Short, I really feel this is definetly a true essential album, Buy it today, it's a classic hit-filled masterpiece!"
4,Great Music,This is one of Peter Gabriel's Best CD's. It has the songs from 1986 that everyone in the US would remember being played all over the airwaves. This is one of my all time favorite albums.
4,Closest to pop,So is the closest to a pop album Peter Gabriel ever came but for all its commercialness Peter Gabriel was always an artist who focused more on quality then quantity and it shows on So. The album still manages to be challenging even with the hits and indeed with the hits. Once again Gabriel shows off his amazing dramatic range and big voice to great effect. The only weak track here is This Is The Picture which is kind of silly.
5,note regarding musician credits,"this is only a note regarding the musician credits found in the remastered version of ""so"". on the booklet's last page, each musician is listed in boldface type, followed by the instrument/vocal credit(s), followed (in parenthesis) by the track(s) that the musician appears on, according to track number. but: the album has been resequenced and the listed track numbers in the credits refer to the original sequence. since ""in your eyes"" has been moved from the middle of the album to the end (and i don't think that this interferes with the overall quality of the album's continuity), the credit numbers are now wrong, starting at track number 5. so, the ""key"" would be (in the form of ""# listed in credits = actual numer on the remastered disc""): #5 = #9 ; #6 = #5 ; #7 = #6 ; #8 = #7 ; #9 = #8."
5,"An incredible album, no other way to say it","To say this album is good is an understatement if ever there was one. ""Sledgehammer"", its groundbreaking video, and its No. 1 single status are classic, and ""Big Time"" achieved commercial success as well. ""In Your Eyes"" is one of the best songs in recent memory from any standpoint-- lyrically, vocally, melodically, you name it. While about unemployment, I'm told, the haunting ""Don't Give Up"" has the power to encourage anyone. The lesser-known tracks on here are all great, and this album is one of few that really stands up as a whole. Even the tracks that weren't hit singles are listenable, memorable, and well-written and well-performed. Alternately rockin', introspective, socially aware, and slightly arty without being pretentious, this album is simply incredible."
4,Not a significant improvement,"I was going to buy this disc because I had lost my previous copy and was looking forward to the improvements. It is still a great album, which has been made better but there is still plenty of noise on the disc so it not remastered to modern quality. If you don't have it is a great buy if you do have it well this isn't worth the upgrade."
5,sound quality,this was a welcome addition to my pg library . the depth and overall dynamics were a big improvement over my old copy . if you are a pg fan get it!
3,On the verge ...,"An album so close to being a masterpiece but doesn't quite make it. Some odd sounding tracks spoil it, but if you can overlook them, buy this alone for the beautiful track ""In Your Eyes"". Who could forget the clever video for ""Sledgehammer"", that song is included on this album as well as the great ""Big Time"". The duet with Kate Bush ""Don't Give Up"" is impressive, probably a little dragged out, but worth listening to. Skip the boring 'Red Rain' track. Nevertheless, in a nutshell, Peter Gabriel's best album to date."
5,Joy To Listen To,It seems every tune on this album is great and the album very easy to listen to over and over again.
3,So...,"I've been wanting this album for a very long time, so I finally just got it! I really love Peter Gabriels voice!"
2,Peter Gabriel Lost Me Here...,"This was a very disappointing album when released and it hasn't grown in stature over the last 20 years for me. ""Red Rain"" gets the album off to an incredible start and really faked me out. Metallic percussion returns and adds a high end back to the sound. ""Sledgehammer"" is okay for a hit single, but weak for Gabriel. His vocals don't fit with soul music at all. ""Don't Give Up"" is an interminable Kate Bush duet that in no way justifies it's 6:30 length! The only other A-class material here is the superb ""In Your Eyes."" It is such a strong song it makes me flabbergasted to think that the awful Roseanna Arquette is the inspiration for it! The rest doesn't merit much discussion one way or another. This was the last Peter Gabriel solo album I'd bother to buy."
1,Don't get ripped off!,"This is just a re-hash of the stereo CD, it's not ""re-mastered"" for multi-channel playback. You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album ""Dark SIde Of The Moon"" or the Eagles ""Hotel California"" or Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road""; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again."
4,it's got it's faults,"everyone says this album is excellent. now i can see where it comes from. I love the songs ""in your eyes"", and ""mercy street"". ""mercy street"" might be my favourite gabriel song. but look at the songs ""we do what we're told"" and ""this is the picture"". seems like peter just needed two more songs for the album. so let's just say that ""so"" is got some great key points, but it's got it's faults. i perfer ""US"""
4,If you like Peter Gabriel you'll like this album.,"Has some great songs...Red Rain, In Your Eyes, Mercy Street, This is the Picture. I think the album ""Us"" is better."
2,Not thrilled,This was so hyped in the media and I was so excited to get it. It really let me down. There wasn't the volume of music nor the quality of sound that was advertised. I love the artist but this left me flat.
4,Great Timeless classic,"Great CD. Get this one if you like Peter Gabriel's classics. It was worth the price to have this one transferrable to MP3, instead of cassette. Better sound quality."
4,Wears well with time,"When I first bought Stuntman way back in 1980 (on LP, of course), it struck me as somewhat mediocre and uninteresting--certainly not one of Froese's better efforts. However, twenty years later, I've changed my opinion somewhat. It certainly isn't Froese's best album, but in some ways it is his most representative. Surprisingly, it's worn rather well with time. The song titles are quite in keeping with the Tangerine Dream legacy, and there are two true masterworks here: the stunningly impressionistic ""Drunken Mozart in the Desert"" and the edgy analog-groove of ""A Dali-esque Sleep Fuse."" The other tracks are good in their own right, and the whole album has a completely different feel than anything Froese had done before--though Ages does resemble Stuntman in some respects.And, as is usual for a Froese album, great cover art."
2,lost somewhere in beetween.,"One of the soloprojects of Tangerine dream spokesman and longest staying member ( in fact the only original member at the time of writing). This album is very melodic, and strangely this makes it quite mediocre. Froese certainly has an ear for melodies, but the more abstract, ambient feelings so closely associated with Tangerine Dream is here lacking. This album rather sounds like that ... called ""classical music on synths"" (read: ""Mozart on Moog"")"
3,"One Master ""Piece"", one fun, the rest are up for grabs.","The main reason ( Which became the only reason ) I bought ""Stuntman"" was for the exquisite and brilliant ten minute ""Drunken Mozart in the Desert"", which is arguably the best piece of solo work that the Father of Tangerine Dream (Frose) has ever released. The title track is a lot of fun. It would be perfect for gymnastic practices( Not that I do any of course ). The rest, well...not too memorable. I love a couple of the title names at least. ( Who couldn't get a smile out of a title named ""Detroit Snackbar Dreamer""?) If you can find it used or on sale, it's worth buying. It could definately use a remastering.The biggest irony about Tadream, to myself at least, is that, as a rule, I find other(ex) members of the band's solo work superior. (""Klemania"" by Franke and ""Wuvein Reit"" by Schmoelling come immediately to mind)"
1,ESSAYS OF FRANCIS BACON (LARGE PRINT),"DID NOT MEET DESCRIPTION BY AMAZON.THERE WAS NO LISTING BY EACH ESSAY TITLE.THERE WAS NO DESCRIPTION IN EACH ESSAY OF MEANING OF ELIZABETHAN TERMS,NOR ANY TRANSLATION OF FREQUENT LATIN QUOTATIONS.NOR ANY INTERPRETIVE COMMENTS ON THE ESSAYS.ALL THESE THINGS ARE FOUND NORMALLY IN MODERN EDITIONS.THIS BOOK WAS DOWNLOADED FROM THE INTERNET AND IT SHOWS."
1,Seeds are a better bargain,"The service is great, but the product is awful. These tiny plants would locally sell for less than 50 cents, not the $10-$12 being asked at Amazon. The plants are are just a few months old, and not very healthy. Buy the seeds instead!PS: Soon after I posted my review, I noticed about 20 positive reviews with today's date on sellers storefront. Before that, there were one or two total! Hmmm.........and after my ps, most of them were gone again. So, just be warned, and be careful!"
4,Trumpet Vine,This plant looked rather scrawny. The leaves came off in the fall. i'll see if it revives in the spring. I had one before and loved it and it waas very large and hardy. I hope this makes it through the first cold winter.
5,clearing the eye,Clearing the eye is a true caption of isis live. I have seen them play in cambridge mass at the middle east and the shows captured remind me of that time. the sound quality is quality. sounds as if removed directly from the sound board. The dvd quality is also very good.
2,disappointing,"The information provided in this book is so basic as to be almost useless for anyone except perhaps those with absolutely no knowledge about the whippet or dogs. However, the quality of the writing is so poor that I really can't recommend it even to those looking for the most elementary guide. At times I was so distracted by the grammar, structure etc that I couldn't absorb the little information that was provided. It's certainly not what I would call a 'manual'. Gorgeous cover picture and lovely shiny paper but value for money, no."
2,Really mis-represeted titile,"I bought this HOPEING --I would be able to see or learn about My Earp. INSTEAD they mostly talked about other people and just a small mention of My Earp. I did get it in a reasonable time. I WOULD NOT buy this again. I even gave it away . Wasn,t worth watching again."
4,Antec 92MM Fan,"I found this product to be the perfect solution to a failed fan in my HP-branded desktop.Between calling and stopping in, I checked almost 20 retailers in my area. Many hadn't heard of a 92mm fan, one even saying there wasn't such a thing. No problems with noise or performance."
4,Antec 92MM SmartCool,"This fan has a tiny sensor in the front of the blades, so be careful not to bend it when you installed it. It comes with a (removable) 4-pin power connector and a separate signal connector to motherboard. Gotta take 1 star out, since the screws provided is to big for the fan, and will break the fan if I force it. I'm using my original screws from the old fan."
2,remingtons don't last long,"this was the 2nd remington shaver (not refurbished, but brand new) we got for my husband and it's the 2nd one to stop holding a charge before 1.5 years (warranty is 2 years - and what a pain it is to arrange to get it serviced). we will NOT be buying a remington ever again."
3,trebly but good,"Interesting to revisit after hearing the first Banyan album. It puts that later recording in an interesting light, since a similar sample-collage technique was employed here nearly a decade previous. Overall, the bass is way too low in the mix -- I end up turning the bass on my stereo all the way up any time I listen to this."
3,Not your typical Watt project,"This is a very interesting album and a real departure from what Watt normally does. Or Hurley or Sharpe for that matter. Actually much closer to Industrial than anything Watt was doing at the time. Album is still very sharp and innovative and sounds in no way ""dated"" (it did come out in 1988, after all). In terms of mainstream music tastes, probably came out about 5 years too early, i.e., would have been much more successful if it had come out during the mainstream boom of the early-mid 1990s. Watt's playing one of those 3/4 scale basses with the nylon strings, giving it an additional bit of cache in terms of Watt's career. This album could be released today and sound just as modern, and for overall innovation and experimentalism it's a 5, but unlike others reviewing articles for amazon, although I like the album, I don't think it's an overall 5- not quite up there with Sgt. Pepper's or Pet Sounds, or in more relevant terms, it's no Double Nickels or Metal Box."
5,Texas Tech Tailgate Party Pack,"This is a Christmas gift, so I personally haven't tried it, but I do like the packaging and how fast it got here. Great gift for a college kid and their room mates."
1,A Negative Tren,"We had the old DOS version of Hoyle Solitaire (1988 Copyright) and when I bought a new computer we wanted to update to a current version. Installed new version and found the following: 1.) Autoplay disappeared. Lets one play out finished game without manually clicking each card. 2.) Replay game is missing. Sometimes it took several tries to win a game, but this is gone now; you can't try again. I re-installed the old version from 1988 (One 1.4MB diskette) and find it better than the current version. Any owner of the old DOS version who buys this version will be severely disappointed; you spent money to downgrade to an inferior product."
2,Not very Mac OSX-friendly . . .,"Not sure how this package of games works on a PC, but is is not very Mac OSX-friendly, from what I can tell. (It is listed as Mac friendly, but I suspect it is probably more PC-oriented.) There are no drop-down menus, and finding instructions for the numerous games - - when there are some - - is not easy, either. The printed materials are virtually useless for this purpose, also. Finally, it seems to be fickle about whether it will let you add players. In short: the CD has dozens of games you can play; but if you are unfamiliar with the game's rules or objects, you wind-up having to try to figure it out for yourself. All-in-all, this CD is a letdown and not what one would expect from Hoyle."
1,londa,"absolutely worthless - the company no longer ""supports"" this game, which means that once you install it, you can't get it to play - in short terms - this is an outdated game and might a swell be tossed"
2,Not so graceful,"I purchased this book through a Montessori catalog. I was disappointed with the book. The parenting tips are written in negative language ""don't do this,"" rather than in a positive, gentle, well..graceful way. It seemed to be more of a litany of what not to do."
1,I can't believe someone charges money for this,"This is the silliest parenting book I've ever seen. It's two or three sentences on a page and while that is, in fact, simple, it's not groundbreaking. It's not even particularly helpful. Yes, I know I shouldn't yell and that it should only be reserved for instances of great danger for my child, how does that help me when my three year old refuses to listen? Come on, don't make me feel like a failure just because I can't refrain from arguing with another human being. Most of this stuff is common sense and what isn't is probably not realistic for 95% of parents. Sorry, I just didn't love this book"
1,"Just ""simple advice"" flash cards",This book is a waste of time and money. The author shares common sense tips but doesn't offer scenarios in which to resolve parenting issues. This seems like a vanity book. The person who got the most from it was probably the author and her son (the artist).
5,Breathtakingly Beautiful Book!,"An Amazingly beautiful illustrated book! I went through cover to cover looking at only the illustrations, then I've read it through a couple of times. What a great story! Truly an inspiration! This is a book that you need to get and put on your shelf next to ""Where The Wild Things Are."" A great book that can be appreciated by all ages."
3,Bingo Cage,WOrks pretty good for a small crowd. The cards are to small so you may want to purchase larger ones. You can only get 4 balls out at one time before they start to catch on the release.
4,hot replacement pickup,good sounding high output replacement pickup with original sound ...not the over driven humbucking sound of some others I've tried.
4,sad story of four men,"""The Enemy Stars"" by Poul Anderson, 1958, new material 1979.This is a sad story of four men who try to study the stars from up close. They are recruited and sent, by way of matter transfer, to a ship near the star. They make some choices and have to adapt and persevere because the choices put them in danger.The fellows are a disparate lot, one rich, one poor, but educated, one ornery and mad, and one sad and reconciled to his fate. These four come together and find out how to live and work together, which is just the first challenge they have.They try to approach the dead star they are studying and it damages the ship. They try to fix it and lose the first man. They try something else that sort of works and crash land on a planet, losing the second person. The one fellow says the sea does not forgive mistakes and it is the same out here. This could be a simile for life in general."
4,HO Girder Bridge Review,The HO Girder Bridge has been installed on a train platform that I created for my grandchildren. The product was well packaged and arrived quickly in perfect condition. It's a nice addition to add realism to the HO train setup.
2,teabag,"Little disappointed, some stalling when using subtitles, picture hangs a bit, might not like being played on Australian dvds."
3,german dictionary,"Convenient size, has a lot of words and phrases, but I found so many words in our traveling that could not be found in the book."
2,Not so helpful,"I was recently in Europe, and wanted to get this book to help translate. The dictionary component is grouped into different categories though, so it was difficult to find the words when you needed to do so quickly. There were also a lot of words that it didn't seem to have the translation for (or at least I didn't find it in time). As such, it ended up not being very helpful in the moments that I had wanted it for (e.g., trying to figure out what to order at a restaurant, etc.)."
4,helpful,This product is convenient to carry and contains pertinent information for the short-time visitor to Germany or Austria.
4,"Great, but one caveat","This is a very useful phrase book, which i have used successfully in germany. it's fresh and fun, unlike other phrase books i have used. i very much agree with other reviewers: this is the best phrase book i have seen, of the 5 or 6 i have used. but, for me, the book is missing what i think could have easily been included: article and gender. the book doesn't list what article (the/a) goes with a noun (masculine, feminine, or neuter; der, die, das/ein, eine, ein). for those with no experience in german this lack may seem like no big deal. but article/gender plays a critical role in constructing sentences--adapting what rick steves provides--because word endings change according to gender."
4,Handy companion,"Very easy to find common, useful phrases. The book is light weight, small enough to carry, yet the print is large enough to read easily."
4,Good Basics,The book was well organized and good hints and tips. But I barely used it in Frankfurt and the areas I visited...lots of English spoken there.
1,"""The Art of MISunderstanding Your Mate""....","This book, originally published in the early 70s, is WAY outdated. Osborne maintains (I am not far from quoting) that unless a woman gets married, gets pregnant, and has a bunch of kids she will never be satisfied. A woman's place is in the home, a man's is at the office, and apparently realizing this is supposed to let you and your mate in on your true identities and lead to blissful lives. Furthermore (and perhaps worse), Osborne insists on stereotyping males and females in ways that were very offensive to both me and my husband. Example: women like to fight to test whether their husband will dominate them, because in the end they like to be dominated. The further we read, the more disgusted we became. Unless you live on some other planet or possibly in some other time period, this book will only lead to MISunderstanding each other. Don't waste your money."
1,Read the books...skip the movie.,"I love Louis L'Amour, especially his epic series: The Sacketts. The stories are believable, tautly written and accessible for just about anyone. Unfortunately, the same cannot not be said about this movie, which is based upon two of the stories: The Daybreakers and Sackett. With great anticipation I watched this movie. I wanted to enjoy it, but no matter how hard I tried I coundn't for one simple reason: The acting is atrocious! Tom Selleck is awful. Mercedes McCambridge is awful (really awful), and sadly, worst of all is Glenn Ford. The best acting comes from the veterans Ben Johnson and Sam Elliot, barely. What frustrates me is that these are talented actors! What kind of direction were they receiving from Robert Totten?? ""One take and next scene"" must have been his credo. Really disappointing.Don't waste your money. Read the books instead."
1,Can't agree with other reviewers,"I am a big fan of Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott. I bought this DVD because of them and the glowing reviews. I have to say that I didn't enjoy this one at all for many reasons.I watched the first hour before I gave up on it and did not find one scene to be memorable or engrossing. The characters were all stereotypes with no real development to make them real. Tom Selleck's character lacked all the touches that made his other characters special. The plot was typical cowboy cliches. The soundtrack was loud, extremely dated, and annoying.I could sit and watch all eight hours of Lonesome Dove at one time or a dozen hours of Deadwood. I didn't even bother to finish watching this and I don't feel like I missed anything. If it had been good enough to keep watching, I would have given it two stars.Oh well, back to Quigley Down Under, Crossfire Trail, and Monte Walsh for me."
4,L'Amour Sacketts - Classic Cowboy,"I prefer Selleck's newer westerns. Still the cast in this movie is a who's who for westerns. Ben Johnson stills the show. Glen Ford is as solid as ever. The ""Sackett boys"" make it look easy. This is now a classic movie from the master classic western writer."
1,not what i expected i guess,i got this for my dad caus he loves louis l'amour and the sacketts but it was like the tv version where it would act like it was going to comercial then come back on ? i was frustrated ! ...i can not get to mad cause i never read to see if it was edited for tv or something i dont know ?
1,Major Letdown,This was not the complete series. Editing left a major hole in the story line. I would strongly suggest getting the full length version.
4,GOOD PURCHASE,This item was purchased as a gift for my father. He was thrilled and pleased with the compilation.For the Westerners at heart (like my father) this is a great buy! I am not into Westerns so can't offer my own comment.
3,Too little payoff for the viewing time invested,"This feature does have good qualities. The casting is spot on, the cinematography great, the character development good. It has the ""feel"" of a good western epic. One doesn't get the impression that any corners were cut.Unfortunately, the pacing is glacial. There just isn't enough story to fill the 193 minutes of screen time. Worse, one of the story lines is wrapped up far too quickly despite the extensive build up it was given. The other story line conclusion is far more satisfactory but the wait seems interminable.In short, this story could have been done on just one of the dvds. Not a bad western by any means but definitely flawed."
5,Great Western!,"Adapted from a story written by one of the greatest western writers of all time, I was happy the video version lived up to my expectations. It was a joy to watch the Sacketts come alive on screen, and be played by some of my favorite actors. I wasn't the least disappointed.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,The Sacketts,"Louis Lamour Western...Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott on the same screen...if you love westerns, this is a must see movie for you."
4,Good Western,"Watching Tom Selleck behave as himself is somewhat disappointing as is the discursive story. Still, the movie is relatively faithful to L'Amour's novels, and for a Western-lover very satisfying. Ben Johnson, as always, is quite satisfying."
1,Never Received Item,I never received this DVD. DVD legacy did not ship the item however they charged my credit card. DVD Legacy would not respond to my inquiries. Amazon never offered to help.
1,Hairiest Western Ever,This is the hairiest western ever! Never before has there been so much wet chest hair in a wash tub with dry ice....as in the scene where the brothers bathe together. (Ooooooo....kinky!). And what is up with the dry ice. Are they supposed to be bathing in boiling water?This sums up this whole never-ending joke of a western. Lame TV at its best....which means don't bother....unless you like real hairy cowboys!
1,Exceedingly Disappointing,"It was very painful to watch such talented actors stumble around in this film. The acting and dialogue were pitiful. Don't waste your money. No matter how much you love the actors, not even a die-hard fan can appreciate this film."
4,Classic Westerns,"The ""Sacketts"" series on dvd is a fine representation ofthe Western sagas, as is always the case when any film orseries is made from the writings of the Master of Westerns,Louis L'Amour. It is a very good addition to any Westernfilm library."
5,best western,i have to say i'm not much for westerns but this movie was awesome. loved it so much. if you really want a good western movie this would be the one to get. and you won't mind that it is really long.
4,Good Movies,"I bought the movie, The Sacketts, for my son. He loves it! I always find what I'm looking for with Amazon."
5,The Sacketts DVD,"I read all 16 of the Louie LaMour Sackett books. I am not a western reader. My brother-inlaw got me started and couldn't get enough so decided to see the DVD which the action is slower than the books, but, was very close to the story. They had Mr. LaMour speak about the movie. He was there during the making of the movie and wanted it to be like it was during that time period. Please read his series of Sacketts before viewing the DVD. aLSO, READ HIS BIOGRAPHY. He was a very speacial man. He died shortly after finishing the biography."
5,Beautiful examples and easy to understand text,I have several other books on handcoloring photographs but this one is the best so far! The examples are very inspiring and the text is very helpful and easy to follow. I definatly suggest this book for anyone interested in handcoloring.
2,Poor coverage; too much emphasis on details,"This book mainly focuses on one type of oil colouring medium (namely Marshall's photo oils) and explains its use in a detailed manner. Illustrations are quite much detailed. In fact, following only the pictures, you already have a rough idea of the method. Reading the whole text however, does not add much on top of it. The book doesn't cover different approaches and techniques and focuses on a particular method of the author. In this sense, if the name of the book was ""How do I handcolour my photographs using Marshall's Oils"" it would have been more appropriate. The guidelines given in the book might be useful for some beginners, however they are too much detailed. The author will try to encourage creativity, by giving certain guides which is a big contradiction. Portrait photography and it's colouring is emphasized in this book, which is another limitation."
5,A beautiful and instructive handbook,"As an amateur photographer, I found the book beautifully designed and very well written. The text is detailed and very useful. I believe that the book will enable me to improve my work, and I look forward to a follow up effort from Ms. Dorskind as I advance my skills further.This is an outstanding contribution that should be on any serious student's bookshelf."
5,The hand painter's bible.,This thorough and beautiful collection of helpful hints and wonderful examples guides the novice and the expert through the complex world of hand painted photography.It's the only real source for this subject. Very easy to digest and easier to enjoy. Much of the photography is true art.
5,"After reading this book, I now know my career of choice.","As a 13 year old, I am now positive of what I want to do with the rest of my life. Mrs. Dorskind's photos and instructional techniques were truly inspiring. I recomend this to all who are interested in either painting or photography."
2,Too basic; makes it look like Marshall is the only way to go,"This book only covers the basics of handpaiting. Most of what's said in the book you can learn it yourself. Furthermore, it looks like a publicity from Marshall. It asumes that Marshall products are the only way to handpaint photos, and never talks about other oils, watercolors, airbrushes, etc. If you are using Marshalls, the tips on how to mix paints can be very usefull."
4,I loved this book!,Ambrose is brilliant!!! He has a way of explaining the planning and telling what the soldiers went through. Amazing!!!
4,small but interesting saga,A thorough look at a key moment on D-Day with some discussion of overall D-Day events. Interesting but mostly for those who already have read one of the numerous overviews of the entire landing.
5,D-Day 6/6/1944,This is a wonderful look at what happened behind the lines on D-day 6/6/1944.Steven E Ambrose just keeps inviting us to the D-Day museum in New Orleans!
4,The Stuff Movies (Should) Be Made Of,"Hollywood's resent production of ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a wonderful tribute ot the men who took part in the greatest of endevour of World War II, however, THAT NEVER HAPPENED! I feel that it is sad that many people feel the need to invent some feat of grand military derry-do To make a good story. If one studies the history of any great event, such as the Normandy invasion, one can find real heros and real acts of heroism that far out shine any fictional event a Hollywood writter might dream up. This event, involving a mere company of British Paras, is one of those actions. Mr. Ambrose did a fine job of telling their story, and hopefully, keeping Major Howard from fading into obscurity, as have other heros, such as Lt.Col Frost, Lt Col Herbert Jones, and countless others."
3,Not Ambrose best effort,A small book about a small but important WW2 episode. The people in the story are real heros not made up so that makes it well worth the reading but it is not one of this authors best outings.
2,A story in search of an author,"My goodness, but here is a terrific bit of history desperately in need of a decent author. Told properly, the final product should be one of those rare books you simply cannot put down. Alas, Professor Ambrose was the one to take up the challenge and what he has wrought is a most amateurish work. His narrative style can be wincingly painful. His is the kind of storytelling I used to read in grade school. At any moment I half-expected Frank and Joe Hardy to appear on the scene. You would be better served by watching THE LONGEST DAY. Darryl F. Zanuck ""told"" the story much better."
5,THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME,I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME BECAUSE IT KEPT ME WANTING TO READ IT MORE AND MORE. I HAD A HARD TIME PUTTING THE BOOK DOWN. IT SEEM TO HAVE TRUE TO FACT KNOWLEDGE OF THE OLD PIONEER DAYS. THE CHARACTERS WERE GREAT.
4,Marvelous Living History,Ox-Team Days on the Oregon Trail. A first hand report from a person who actually did the Oregon Trail is so very special. His descriptions of the settlements and of the people were fascinating. How wonderful that he lived to make the Oregon Trail a monument. May we never forget the drive and the hardship these people suffered to tie our Nation together.If they hadn't gone we very well could not have kept the whole Oregon territory without a war.
3,Uncle Trapspringer Maybe....Well Written - Not!,"i just could not visualize the misadventures of the supposed U.T. in this book. it was almost like i was listening to someone telling me their almost disorganized thoughts (often with loose associations) and wishing they would either be more detailed and connected or just hurry up and get to the point. the story had potential, but just was not well written. perhaps the editing team let this one slip past them without them even reading it, much less editing it."
4,We finally get a good look at the most legendary kender .,This kender doesn't sound like the legendary kender that Tasselhoff always told about.
1,Worst Dragonlance Book I Ever Read,"I read my first Dragonlance more than 10 years ago and I've been an ardent fan since. So when I got my hands on this one, I was full of expectations.However, this book was a real letdown. I had to force myself to go through each page and finally gave up. The narration sounded like sentences in childrens' books. The kender didn't seem to act or speak like kender and the gully drarves were either too smart or too irritating. The death knight wasn't much of a Death Knight nor was Takhisis her usual Godlike self.The author, being new to Dragonlance series should have done her homework better and found out more about the Dragonlance world we all know and love. This was really a waste of such a promising title as a book of short stories on Uncle Trapspringer's adventures would indeed be very welcome to the Dragonlance series."
4,One of the funniest books I have ever Read!,"If your a kender fan you should definately go out and grab this book. Uncle Trapspringer makes for a great story. Some people are complaining that he's not like most kender, which is a relief, it's nice to see some originality here. Also people have been complaining about the fact that he did not live up to the stories that Tasslehoff told of him. Well Tas like most kender EXAGERATES! Of course he isn't quite as legendary as Tas's tales said he was, they were kender tales. All in all this has the whole package, good story, some gullu dwarves (a little bit more intelligent than the norm, but like before it's nice to see some change.Over come by wanderlust (like all kender) Trapspringer ends up traversing Krynn, falling into company with a couple of gully dwarves and an evil fiend. The evil fiend is great, it'll keep you rolling with laughter.So give the book a chance, get it fom the library id you can. You'll probly like it more than you would have thought!"
2,Kender funny but monotonous,"The book's main characters, Trapspringer and his sister were typically entertaining kender, however, the action predictable and lackluster. If you like kender, you'll like it, if you like a good Dragonlance story, skip it."
1,A Horrid book,"This book started off slow and never picked up. There is nothing interesting or different about Uncle Trapspringer, it is a complete waste of time and money. I found the Kender to be so completely depressing. It is the ownly Dragonlance book so far that I have completely dispised."
4,Good but shop for best price,This is the only release of Romance Dance on CD and it is a classic. This release is two albums recored on one CD...so I queston if the sound quality suffers a bit by cramming 21 songs on one CD. Amazon's version is over priced---look to buy from one of the other vendors for 1/2 the price for the exact same CD.
1,go for bonnie tyler instead,"kim has a great voice but sorry her stuff sounds very dated, u can listen to bonnie tylers old stuff and it hasnt dated. still sounds as good as her new stuff"
1,"Hyper, shallow, short","Well produced. Well shot. Well ""acted"". Very scant on teaching. I had to rewind to make sure I did not somewhat skip the explanation on how or where to aim. No more than 1 sentence is given to the subject. Only useful if you want to learn -in a hurried manner- the name of the elements, and (some of) the rules of 8 and 9 ball. A good DVD pool primer is still missing."
1,"""Too Basic"" is ""Too Kind"" to this DVD","I agree with everything in the ""Too Kind"" review. The contents of this DVD could easily fit into a couple of chapters of a basic billiards book. If you are just starting out, and I mean JUST starting out, this DVD has about $5 worth of good information."
1,do not order,"do not order this scrapbook, i placed and order for this and never received it. instead i was sent some charm for a necklace that looked like it came out of a cracker jack box. i would recommend not buying from this company."
2,not very unique,"i was a fan of duane's first few wizard books, so i picked this up. i guess i'm in a minority here, but i wasn't very impressed w/ this book. granted, it was one of duane's earliest efforts, but the plot is predictable and book lays on the mythology really thick. also, duane's dialogue feels out of place with its constant, very american-sounding vernacular. there are just a few interesting twists. the most interesting is the way she explores sex and sexuality, and the ideas of open relationships, bisexuality, and sex in relation to religion. it's also nice to see a (mostly) homosexual character in the main role, but the last herald mage series by mercedes lackey is much more poignant. be aware that this edition (1984) is a revised edition and slightly diff. from the original 1979 edition."
5,Open the Door,"This is the beginning of an incredible series--and Ms. Duane says the fourth and final book is FINALLY coming out this year! I love Ms. Duane in all her shadings, but I believe this quartet is among her finest work. Every page is edged with light. Her characters are so real that I wish they lived down my block--so I could go talk to them and learn more about them. I can't wait for the fourth book. At last, at last!"
2,Affirmation / Quote Book. Not a Goddess book.,"This book is only for people who like affirmations or quotes from famous women. There is no artwork other than the cover. Not for people who collect books on the Goddess. Also, it is a mini-book."
2,"Phone might be ok, but not the bracket.","The wall bracket is thin plastic,and snaps onto the back of the phone.As you attempt to hang the phone on the wall, the slightest pressure breaks off the cheaply made bracket. Don't buy this phone, go for an ATT."
1,Broke in 1 Month,"The phone is very inexpensive, and it shows in quality. Feels cheap, doesn't have some basic features (e.g. no memory dial), need to disconnect phone from wall to turn ringer on/off.In less than 1 month the phone broke...still rang, but no dial tone. There is a 1 year warranty, but who's going to go through the hassle of sending in a [price] phone to get fixed? So I opened it up to see what happened. There was a wire that had come unsoldered, but there was also a ribbon cable that had been cut and repaired with tape during manufacturing. Obviously not a very thorough QA process that repairs a wire with tape, instead of replacing it.You get what you pay for. Steer clear of this phone."
2,A bit too fairy tale,"Normally, BB books are quite all right to read, if you're looking for a snach read for a rainy afternoon. However, this one has some serious weaknesses apart from the fact that I personally don't like made up kingdoms and princesses. Part of the story is set in Austria and therefore there are some supposedly German parts mixed into the dialogue. However, Ms. Barton should do a little more research to offer correct German. Only because there are Umlaute does not mean that every vowel gets two little dots on top. The question 'How are you`, when literately translated, asks for a characteristic of a person rather than being a polite formula. The answer to this question could be something like nice, fat or stupid.So, I found this booh really quite boring and way too far fetched. Read this only if you are really desperate and waiting for all the good books to be shipped."
2,From Back Cover,"This arrogant, ill-mannered American was hardly the sort of man Princess Adele of Orlantha was used to encountering in her world of wealth and privilege. And yet Matt O'Brien was all that stood between her and the deadly conspiracy that threatened everything she held dear.Her only hope was a marriage - in name only - to her self-appointed ""protector."" But to be so very... intimate with this infuriating yet dangerously compelling man was almost more than she could bear - because their masquerade was turning into a passion that was all too real.13th in The Protector's series"
3,Fulton TK 1000100 Trailer Wheel Lock,"It is OK, it will only slow a thief down. I had to have a welding shop modify the part that the lug nut from the wheel so a thief could not get a wrench on it. The way it was manufactured anyone could get a wrench on the lug nut and if you get the lug nut off the lock is useless. The orange part that wraps around your trailer tire also catches rain water and when you remove the wheel lock if you are not careful you will get rust water on you and all over the paved surface the trailer is parked. i use other methods of keeping my trailer secure, this is just one method to slow a thief down but i recommed if you purchase it to have a welder make a wrap so to speak around the lug nut so you can get the lock off when you need too. if the thief has a battery power grinder they can remove this lock in a few seconds, however it will require the thief to make noise."
2,Another Mediocre Solo Effort,"How can a guy blessed with such a tangible, emotive voice be making such mediocre albums? He loses his band mates, spends more time with the wife and kid, and mellows out. You'll find none of the excruciating despair or alienated angst of Ashcroft's work with the Verve here. He's happy, the songs are happy. Everything's peachy . . . that is, except the album. When Ashcroft, the undisputed master of melancholic love songs, shows up on other people's records (see The Chemical Brothers' ""Come With Us"" or UNKLE's ""Psyence Fiction""), he delivers. So why, a fan's got to wonder, doesn't he expose that edginess when the limelight's squarely on his gangly physique? I give up."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'm a fan of Richard Ashcroft and the Verve, and loved ""Alone With Everybody."" However, ""Human Conditions"" doesn't even come close to his prior work--including the fantastic ""Urban Hymns."" In fact, I was surprised how uninspiring ""Human Conditions"" is. It's a sorry departure from his traditional hypnotic, edgy tunes. ""Human Conditions"" is filled with ten forgettable, banal songs without a single one that I would call ""catchy."" I truly hope his next CD returns to his trademark sound."
1,disastre...,"what can i say?...we've got another Sting here... this album (isnt good), sorry that guy from Munich..i love Munich Philarmonic, but sorry,this album is terrible. why don't u try Shining's True Skies, it's not as good as Verve,but it's definitly better thant this one!"
5,BLOODY AWESONE!!!! IT'S GREAT MAN!!,"As Chris Martin said once: ""Richard Ashcroft is the best singer in the world"", and believe me man, it's true. Human Conditions gathers glam and nostalgic elements that a britpop music love could adore. This cd opens with the great ""check the meaning"" the best example that you'll find in the musical journey Mr Ashcroft can offer in this album. It's really nice to hear every song, 'cause they're really sentimental, the lyrics have meaning, everythign fits correctly, the rest: just sit back and enjoy!!."
2,why ashcroft why?,why richard ashcroft after a fantastic first album follow it up with such trite as this...god check the meaning is boring mediocre twoodle and the rest of the songs all sound the same i bought this when it was first released and it sat gathering dust of ages until the other week i decide too give it another go because i heard he's releasing a new album new year and thought i would get in the mood for some great vocals and what i got was a depressing boring whingey album of twoodle i love buy it in bottles and bright lights but the rest sound like something you would expect from the over-rated i mean OVER-RATED band radiohead not from a guy that gave up three classic albums with the verve sorry richard this is craphope you pick up the pace with your new album and go back to the glory days of the verve
3,HELL OF A LOT BETTER THEN HIS FIRST SOLO ALBUM,"This album is easily 100 times better than Alone with Everybdy. Ashcroft's first solo outing was such a bust I puked in my soup. Human Conditions, much like his first solo joint sounds absolutely nothing like any of The Verve's material (and that is a bad thing), however this album is at least listenable. Good tracks on this one include Science of Silence, Check the Meaning, and Running Away. It seems Ashcroft is content with wasting his talent pursuing the Alt-country fanbase and abandoning his alt-rock experimental followers. When I first heard him sing on songs like Man on Mission, God in the Numbers and Bright Lights, i was too emabrrassed to play the album in front of my friends, I mean his faking a western accent is so retarded it's a sin. I really wish he would start rocking out again, hopefully he'll get divorced or something because he only produces awesome material when his life is in shambles."
4,Alone With Everybody..the next frontier!,"Richard Ashcroft, as confirmed by Christ Martin of Coldplay, is the best, most gifted, most talented singer/songwriter of his generation. From his classic and timeless work with The Verve, to his amazing solo debut ""Alone With Everybody"", to ""Human Condition"" and ""Keys To The World"", Ashcroft shines brightest! Human Condition continues Ashcroft quest for self-discovery, God, faith, love and redemption. Isn't that everyone's story? Pick up Alone With Everybody and his latest Keys To The World..this man's music is like candy to one's soul!To those looking for The Verve...this is not it; neither was ""Alone With Everybody or Keys To The World."" You want The Verve? Then go buy ""FOUR""..it is amazing!"
2,This Mouse Hates Keyboards,"It really isn't that this mouse is the worst, it is just that it seems to be useless if you do not have a basic keyboard (ie: just the 101 keys, no easy one-touch access keys).When I used my basic keyboard it worked fine, no faults. But with the enhanced keyboard it would lock up the computer or just stop functioning.So instead of buying this mouse, you should look into the Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical. For only a couple of dollars more you could have the reliability and stability of a mouse that will be fully supported by a Windows system."
1,computer crashes,"After installing this mouse from the disk, which you have to do if you want the scroll to work, my computer constantly freezes, then shuts down and restarts."
5,Must be read and expirienced,"I have never found the motivation to write the book review even when I came across a good one. This book changed that. More significantly it has changed myself or better yet helped to discover the lost one. This is not just a motivational, self-help material that tries to bring the best in you. Rather it is like discovering the simplest things and seeing them in a different, simple, true light. All of these principals are brought by Rav Laitman in easy to follow format and yet it is easy but not oversimplified. I felt like the mystery was unveiling in front of me. How could the life to so simple and you could appreciate it seeing the genius of the simplicity and perfection. This book is a must read for anyone who has not found the ultimate joy in life in its current state. Not only I recommend this book but I urge you to buy it."
5,True Kabbalah,"This book is a must for beginners and serious students alike. The translation is smooth and concise. The uses of complex Kabbalah terms are kept to a minimum while the explanations are straight forward, clear and enlighten. Rav Laitman guides the reader the through the Upper Worlds with gental words that reflect the great Light of this teacher.From the first chapter to the last, the reader will find the statement and response format a workable style, which allows the maximum comprehension with anchor points for rereading specific sections.When one delves into this book they will find the light of authentic Kabbalah shining through. Like other books written by Rav Laitman, returing to this work again and again, will increase their understanding of true Spiritual Kabbalah and will experience the expansion of the Light that shines within."
4,Interesting,"I am not all the way through the book yet, but it is very intersting so far. Very educational and uplifting."
5,A wonderful introduction,"This is an outstanding book for anyone interested in how people think, and how people can change the way they think, feel and relate to others. A wonderful survey of the research literature on psychotherapy, but also a great overview for anyone interested in changing others' attitudes and behavior. The topics are relevant and the authors' writing is succinct, clear and engaging. The models of depression, anxiety, inhibition and psychological change are very helpful to anyone in any of the helping fields."
2,A fairly good movie,"This movie must not be confused with the earlier Bud Spencer comedy, ""They Called Him Bulldozer"". This movie here is one of those that came out after Bud Spencer stopped acting in comedies. I guess I'm not used to Bud Spencer not doing so. It's a case of an actor acting in plenty of one genre of films, and then suddenly in another. In these Bud Spencer as private investigator Jack Costello movies, I have difficulty hearing what Bud Spencer says. But, not in the earlier comedies. I wonder why. I think one lot is dubbed.The film still has a good story, showing what hidden atrocities there could have been in the Vietnam War, and resultant vengeances."
1,Decieving looks.,"I bought this item because it looked way better than all-plastic sprinklers. However, regardless of the looks it still plastic where it counts the most, the gear is made of plastic. It didn't last even a season. So stay away from this item for this money you can shop around and find a better one."
2,"Cheaply Built, don't waste your money!!!!",I purchased this and the plastic part that attaches to the hose broke only a few weeks after starting to use it. It is now useless and I have to purchase something else. Not worth your money!!!!
2,hose end cracked off,"I was satisfied with the performance of this sprinkler until 2 wks after purchase it got stuck in one setting and wouldn't adjust,maybe because I did not turn off the water while adjusting it's motion arm. Anyhow I stepped on the plastic hose end and it cracked off. Now it is worthless because I cannot attach the hose to it and there is no way to replace the hose end. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,"Once more, with feeling","Cheap plastic part -- the ""heart"" that makes this sprinkler so special is made of plastic with a plastic washer to hold it on, briefly. Save your money and get a drip hose."
3,What's up with Fox and blu-ray?,"No HD glory here, only smeared faces. The worst looking blu-rays in my collection:-Die Hard-Predator 2-Point BreakThey're all Fox titles! And it's such a shame as ""Point Break"" is really an excellent movie.It's not like they don't know how to do it, ""Speed"" looks great."
2,Blu-Ray Review Only,"Not impressed with the picture quality at all. Unfocused, grainy, just not what I expected. I have a lot of old movies on blu-ray so I know what a good one should look like. Better than DVD quality but not by much. Disappointing."
4,NICELY DONE EVEN IF A BIT DATED,"A bit dated but still nicely done. The tale is more than an excuse to show bare chested guys and surf scenes. There's an actual attempt to cover the surfer culture and even focus on the spiritualism of the sea. Overall, there are some nicely done action scenes and the manner of locating The American Presidents feels believable. Very small role by a thin Tommy Sizemore. Still some great humor scenes, too. Keanu is referred to as ""Young, dumb and full of cum."" LOL MY GRADE: B plus."
1,picture freeze,"Just like Arie Socorro, I had the same problem on the picture freezing on that particular chapter. You have to skip to the next chapter to get it going. Other than that this movie is great"
4,A very good action movie! Has it all!,"I think Point Break was a very good movie! It has it all; a good story, beautiful, cool surfing-scenes,good actors. Only minus: it was a little too long. They could have shortened it a little.."
2,Not What I Expected!!!,"I'm a die hard fan of Ms. Bigelow's films, specially this one. I've been expecting it's release ever since DVD's been out!, but for starters: there's not even an animated menu, the extras are nothing but trailers, especially that 3 minute featurette, they don't even mention or show anything that's really something you could call a featurette. And also, when I reached chapter 10 that dual layer pause just freezed!, I passed then to chapter 11 just so that I could scan back to chapter 10 and then my DVD freezed completely. I sent Amazon my comments, and I got another DVD. To my surprise that same thing happened again and again. If someone has the same problem as me, please let me know so that the guys at Fox replace us with our money. Anyway, besides that, the flick is still great!"
5,"In australia, region 4, get the movie from here.","I saw the movie at the cinemas. The stupid censors or maybe just the version for australia has a scene missing from it. The scene when they take the babe ""showering"" girl completely naked out of the house when she is arrested after the gun battle with surfers. This is just after Johny utah almost gets his head in the lawn mower.Some people are just stupid."
3,Endless Summer,"""Point Break"" is the first R-rated movie I ever saw. It was middle school, and the thrill of the forbidden. It's a fun,cheesy blend of Buddhism, bank robbery, and surfing. Keanu Reeves stars as a police investigator, who's hot on the trail of Bodhi (Patrick Swayze),a bank robber who wears the masks of Presidents. The late Swayze is pitch-perfect as the serene stoner who guides Reeves in the ways of the Force. ""Point Break"" is one of those bad movies that's so cheesy and campy,it's a cult classic. There's plenty of action, skydiving, philosophizing, a gratuitous love scene--and Swayze carries the movie (would you trust Reeves with THAT???)Patrick Swayze was a great actor and human being. He will be missed. (1952-2009)"
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"Not since Chicken Fried Steak met Country Gravy has there been such a dynamic pairing as Patrick ""Forever Lulu"" Swayze and Keanu ""Permanent Record"" Reeves. The ""whoa""s fly fast and furious as Johnny Utah (Reeves), a hotshot FBI agent, pursues Bodhi (Swayze), a tan little fellow with Bon Jovi's hair who dresses up in adorable little costumes and robs banks. Gary Busey (the other Nick Nolte) gives a powerhouse performance as Utah's partner, and Lori ""Free Willy"" Petty, in one of her thinnest roles, is the girl Johnny likes to sleep with. Point Break is 100% pure adrenaline and Mike's ""Point Break"" RiffTrax is 100% pure nitrous oxide!"
3,Drop Dead Gorgeous!,"I must shamefully admit, I purchased this movie simply to gaze at Keanu's loveliness. The man is beautiful!"
3,point fail,"Not Like expected!!, i though i could find clear oceans and high definition everywhere but i was wrong."
3,Point Break,"A pretty early movie of Keanu Reeves. Some think he's not very polished yet, but I like it."
4,Johnny Utah first played football,"then joined police force, now he in surfing for the police to find out where the surfer bank robbers are."
3,"Keanu Reeves best film to date - still. ""The Ex-Presidents are Surfers...""","Keanu Reeves and Patrick 'Sleazy' are goodtogether here in this very likable surfer /bank robber flick. Does kind of give surfersa bad rep though! Lori Petty and Gary Buseyare superb in supporting roles. In fact Busey(until he's killed off) steals most of hisscenes, if not the whole movie as the robberycop vet who takes Reeves under his wing andsteers him in the right direction. A good come-back for Swazey after the stupid 'Ghost' andsappy 'Dirty Dancing'! That killer wave in Aus-tralia/finish is outstanding! {Actually three-and-one half-stars)."
5,I AM AN F.B.I. AGENT!,"This is the best surfing movie with gary busey in it since Big wednesday, which I also highly recomend watch them both they are excellent."
5,excellant you will not be disappointed,patrick swayze and reeves in one of there best performances ye
4,Song Title,This is not a review but a question. For anyone that may know the title of the music being played while Brody and Utah are skydiving near the end of the movie?
3,Duuude?,"My wife loves this movie. It's a pretty cheesy movie, but if you like Patrick Swayze, I guess this is all you."
4,Brotastic,"This product arrived ahead of schedule, the quality of the video was very high, I would recommend using this retailer again."
4,good movie that may seem familiar,ever notice how much the fast and the furious is exactly the same plotline as point break? yea. instead of surfers its drivers. thats kinda why i didnt like the fast and the furious. the stories already been told...and told much better in POINT BREAK.
5,Very satisfied!!,"first of all, this title has a DTS audio format. It maybe attracts you. Because the story is about surfer and surfing.the sound is very important, i think.anyway, if you have seen this movie before and like it, you should have this title. the sound and clear screen will make you happy and satisfy.and you'll see what the ""100% adrenalin"" is."
4,Extremely Entertaining!,"Let's see here. We have Patrick Swayze as the Zen-Buddhist, bank robbing, surfer guru Bodhi. We have Keanu Reeves as Johnny ""I AM A FBI AGENT!"" Utah. We have Gary ""I was once nominated for a Best Actor Oscar"" Busey as Utah's over-the-hill partner. We have an absurd plot about surfers, bank robberies, and FBI agents. It looks like we have all the ingredients for a bad movie: bad actors, hammy acting, and a really stupid plot.Yet ""Point Break"" is a very entertaining film. It is fast paced and fun. It's the kind of movie that you just slip your brain into neutral and sit back and enjoy. Of course, it's a hoot to watch Keanu as Johnny Utah. (Gotta love that name!) Keanu is at his wooden best here and he delivers some real knee-slappers."
4,100% Pure Adrenaline,"First I have to say, that as a surfer, I am biased. However I LOVED this movie. It is definitely in my top 10 action films of all time. Keanu is, well, Keanu, no better, no worse. Busey is probably better than average here, Swayze doesn't fit the role, but does a decent job with it nonetheless. Lori Petty was beautiful, sexy, and believable as Tyler, and the everpresent B-movie staple, John C. McGinley was great as Harp. Chili Pepper Anthony Kiedis makes a cameo, too.The action sequences were superb, especially the breathtaking skydiving scenes. This movie also has arguably the best two man chase scene in movie history. The plot is fairly original and engaging, and Keanu has a few good one-liners that elicit a chuckle every time. My only real complaint is that this movie is not available on DVD in the US."
5,POINT BREAK IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL KEANU FANS!,"This movie is a thrill a minute. It is one of the few movies you can watch many times and enjoy every time. It gets your adrenaline flowing with all the action (plus gets your heart rate up eyeing Keanu- he is gorgeous in this movie and plays his character Johnny Utah impeccably!) Any action film lover will love this one: bank robbing, surfing, sky-diving, etc... This movie in one word - EXCITING!"
1,don't buy the dvd,"all the dvd is, is the vhs version with the top and bottom cut off on the screen.i rented the vhs and dvd together one day and found once you get passed the widescreen intro that the vhs version actually shows more of the movie. the dvd is the full screen version with the top and bottom removed!this is ridiculous. go rent it yourself and see."
4,am i rating the product or the movie?,"Keanu Reeves plays a fresh from the academy FBI agent who goes under cover as a surfer to find a bank robbing group who calls themselves the ex-presidents, action ensues. The movie never takes it's self too seriously though, so as long as you don't either, it's enjoyable. This was after Keanu's Bill and Ted days but before the Speed and Matrix days. Since Keanu already sort of talks with a surfer accent people who are turned off by this normally might not mind. Patrick Swayze is the cool head surfer/ spiritual leader, Lori Petty is great as the love interest, and Gary Busey is great as crazy Gary Busey. Style wise, I would put it on par with Speed for action, plot, and corny/awesome one liners. If you liked Speed for any reason other than just Sandra Bulock, then you may like Point Break as well."
1,NOT Blu-ray Quality - DVD Quality on Blu-ray disc,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Waited for it to come out on Blu-ray and was really looking forward to seeing this in HD, but unfortunately the quality is only DVD quality, so a waste to buy it on Blu-ray if you already have it on DVD. (viewed on a 60"" HDTV)"
3,Keanuuuuuuu,Well its Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves in a movie about surfers who rob banks and sky dive. I have no idea what else to say about this movie. It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't.
1,Did I See The Same Movie?,"I'll go out on a limb here as probably the ONLY person who totally loathed this movie. Let's see...it was annoyingly predictable from beginning to end, poorly acted--and that's saying something for Keanu Reeves, and the ""action"" sequences, if they can be called that, were uninspiring at best. I'm not sure where all the described adrenalin rushes were coming from, but you'd have to be painfully wound up already to get them from this flick. About the only redeeming thing about his picture(if you're a woman,anyway)is seeing Mr. Reeves looking fairly buff. The only reason I give this a star at all is because you can't get out of the review field without one. This isn't a good ""bad"" movie, it's just plain bad."
1,Terribly Disappointing,"This was a horrible movie to say the least. I was greatly disappointed. It was highly immoral and most of the people hardly had any clothes on. Besides that kind of stuff, the movie portrayed the rebellious, thieving bad guys as the good guys. By the end of the movie, you actually started to feel sorry for the bad guys.Not worth anyone's time."
1,Bad,It wasn't a good movie. It isn't for kids. The movie had a lot of things that didn't need to be show and played.
5,"Intelligent, thought-provoking drama","Despite excellent supporting performances, this movie is really a one-man show: it's all about Spader's smart, emotional performance as Daniel Ellsberg.Very little of the movie happens in the Watergate time-frame from which we know Ellberg's name. Most instead covers the ten years (roughly 1963-1973) during which he reached the point of thinking the most patriotic act he could take was to release top-secret Department of Defense material about the Vietnam war. It's an engrossing exploration of the great questions: what is duty? to whom do we owe loyalty?Nothing explodes, except during a few striking, necessary scenes in Vietnam. Thanks be for intelligent film-making."
4,The Pentagon Papers,"This is also a good movie but its showed with the same details just not quite as in depth as some of the other movies on this topic.But if you were for the Vietnam War, then I recommend you see this movie or at least a movie on The Pentagon Papers topic. The truth will leave you feeling allot of controversy. Was this war justified or not??? I lost four family members in this war. When I see this movie and others on this topic, it makes me angry. This is a war that could have been avoided. And if not avoided then it should have been put into the hands of our generals and left to them to decide how to win it. But according to the Pentagon Papers, our country could not have ever won this war. I hate to think that so many of our soldiers died in vein, to include my own family members. But I do respect our soldiers who indeed tried to free Vietnam with all of their hearts."
4,Waechtersbach KIWI plates.,"Waechetersbach (pronounced Veck ters bahk) dinner plates have got to be the most vibrant,colorful along with festive and great quality plates I have ever purchased. I bought the ""Coupe"" style in Kiwi. The ""Rimmed"" style seemed to be a brighter lime green color. The coupe style had a bit darker of a hue but I still think they are fabulos. Amazon had the plates at my door in a week. For more colors try Waechtersbach warehouse, or Waechtersbach usa.They are a bit on the expensive side... about 12$ per plate, but so well worth it. :)Also: NOT microwavable (it will crack the colors on the ceramic) but dishwasher safe."
4,Buy Crosstalk instead,"I love the Grape, they truly are the great unsung band of the 60's. Their stuff is almost uniformly great. That said, this is only the 3rd best Moby Grape compilation out there. The best of course is the 2-disc ""Vintage"", which I think you can still find on Amazon UK. If you don't feel like hunting, then get ""Crosstalk"", which is cheaper than this release and has a better track selection. There's no way a Moby Grape best-of can be considered definitive while missing two of their best songs, ""Fall On You"" and ""It's a Beautiful Day Today""."
3,''2ND TIER BAND INDEED'',"Reading these overblown hyped up reviews was truly a treat!!To much acid i suspect,especially S.king.The claim that they had better '5 part' harmony then the BEACH BOYS is especially ridiculous and also the claim that J.Spence was a top 5 best guitarist makes me cringe ,just listen to his vibrato and string bending and you'll hear the same amatuerish uncontrolled drivel that many lower tiered guitarist displayed in that era.I know this soundS like just a bashing session but it is not,it's just reality., the music on this disc is very good for what it is a SAN FRANCISCO TYPE MUSIC BAND, NO BETTER NO WORSE THAN THE OTHERS FROM THAT AREA AND TIME!"
1,Reviewing the group rather than the record,"A new record is out, and I want to know if it is good. I already know the previous work of Moby Grape and I do not need Sam King telling me how good the group is. He is right but redundant. I want to know if there is anaything new on the record that I have not got or heard. From reading the 8 reviewers, I see no mention of any new material. I assume that everything on the record is recycled from the original releases and several previous compilations. A proper review might then begin with: ""why does anyone need this. The second hand stores have copies of the previous compilations."" The next issue is why the record company did not release something new, like the Amsterdam concert. Should record companies be rewarded when they have such conservative release policies. Why buy these songs again? Foolish, right."
1,Doesn't Live Up to the Hype,"Moby Grape is absolutely the most over-rated group to emerge from the late sixties. What little appeal they might have had is mitigated by the ridiculous claims of their followers, i.e. ""better first album than the Beatle, Byrds, Stones, Airplane et al"". At best, this is a highly debatable claim. At worst, it's a complete falsehood (my view).Spence's work on the first two Airplane albums is better than his work with the Grape thanks to the far superior vocals of Marty Balin/Signe Anderson/Grace Slick and the intiguing guitar interplay provided by Casady, Kantner and Kaukonen.I've tried to get into the Grape, several times. But the hype is such a turn off. Particularly when the group fails miserably to live up to it."
4,My fifth favorite Gilliam film that fits into most genres.,"This film ranks with me 5th behind the Baron, Brazil, 12 Monkeys, and Fear & Loathing but that doesn't mean I think its bad. Not by any means. I am a loyal Gilliam fan and I never sell out. The casting of Williams was perfect and I loved how Gilliam combined this film into a drama/comedy/fantasy/adventure/romance. The romance element was very unexpected and it worked great."
4,Excellent!,"Williams (Perry) is a homeless genius who lives in a fantasy world of Red Knights and King Arthur. Bridges is Jack, a radio personality whose career is destroyed after a listener acts out his advice. This tragedy brings Jack and his new homeless philosopher and friend together.There are many moments of joy, and heartbreak and romance. Fisher King is a wonderful movie for all to enjoy. Williams as always is brilliant. He will make you laugh, smile, cry and applaud. Bridges holds is own but Mercedes Ruehl is terrific! But the true star is film's message. The film is rated R for scene of nudity. Cover the kid's eyes for a few minutes and let them enjoy the rest of the film."
3,Gilliam's most visually tamed film,"Terry Gilliam is a visionary; with a scope too large for even Hollywood productions. Visually and structurally tame, this offbeat moral comedy provides enjoyable, and consistent performances from both Bridges and Williams. The script has its flaws, but subtley it has all the hallmarks of a Gilliam movie, with little visual flairs popping up here and there (i.e. the dark knight in the forest.) Although, I feel this is the weakest of Gilliam's body of work, it still carries the viewer through with memorable moments worth watching."
2,A few moments of truth amidst a lot of silliness.,"This movie has a few poignant lessons borrowed from Arthurian legends and the Don Quixote story--but read the originals instead of wasting time on this slow-moving film that is mostly filler between a few good scenes. By the time the Jeff Bridges character broke into the castle to steal the Grail, I no longer cared if he made it or what would happen if he brought it to Robin Williams.Good performances by Jeff Bridges and Mercedes Rhuel, just wish they'd had better material to work with. Robin Williams plays the type of character we're familiar seeing him do--zany, devil-may-care, society's-opinion-be-damned guy who tries too hard to make you love him."
5,The Fisher King,"Directed by Terry Gilliam....Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges, Amanda Plummer, and Mercedes Reuhl combine their awesome talents to create a remarkable modern-day dark fable of love and adventure in Manhattan's. sometimes harsh, cultural realty.Bridges plays a ""shock jock"" who unwittingly helps to cultivate more madness in Manhattan, a karmic psychological madness that he finds constantly dogging his heels. Williams plays a vigilante knight, coincidentally created by Bridges' radio show, running loose in Manhattan (and his own mind) on a quest for the holy grail, ""a billionaire's bowling trophy"". As Bridges slides deeper into his karmic pit of unresolved guilt the exciting and gorgeous Mercedes Reuhl plays an oscar-winning role as his lover on the way down. Amanda Plummer succeeds as William's timid mousy love interest.Excellent casting, excellent plot, and excellent entertainment set in a great city- New York!"
3,Promising but uneven,"When radio host Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) inadvertently causes a psycho to go on a killing spree in a restaurant, he is incapacitated by guilt and spirals into an alcohol-fueled depression. He is offered a chance for redemption when he meets Parry (Robin Williams),a homeless, delusional survivor of that tragedy who believes that he had been tasked with finding the Holy Grail. Bridges is excellent and Williams overacts entertainingly as one of those oddball characters brimming over with energy that he has played so many times. Unfortunately, the screenplay and direction have an uneven tone. Parry's psychological pain and the disturbing Red Knight that tortures him with its resemblance to raw, exploding flesh carry some real impact, but it is buried in a screenplay that is far too cutesy and superficial the rest of the time."
5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"This movie is pure magic!! It is the ultimate in ""Jungian"" adventure and ""Hero"" searching ala Joseph Campbell. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges bring these compelling characters to life...and beyond. Any student of psychology should perform a Jungian review on this movie. Joseph Campbell's ""Hero With a Thousand Faces"" also describes these characters with unparralled accuracy and definition. Not even ""Star Wars"" (the original Episode IV) can compare with the intricate psychological spectacular that is ""The Fisher King."" Oh, did I mention that I loved this movie???"
5,Touching Movie,"I watched this when it was in the theater and enjoyed it then. It is a really intense movie, with some humor in it. Well worth seeing again."
2,Wait For A Remastered Blu-Ray,"This is one of my favorite movies, and definitely my favorite of Terry Gilliam's. That is the reason I was very disappointed in this Blu Ray release that is nothing but a straight transfer from DVD at best with no extras whatsoever. Wait for a decent release. I would give it one star, but I actually love this movie and couldn't bring myself to do it...."
4,the fisher king,"item ordered from import cd's did not arrive dhl tracking # invalid, usps tracking # says delivered but no blu ray in mail box. Reordered direct from amazon delivered quickly no problem.Import cd's refunded my cost for blu ray and shipping. thanks kenNote required for grandson's college course, he got it and made report on last available day for college credit."
5,Great Movie!,"""The Fisher King"" is one of my favorites; when I heard it was coming out on Blu-ray, I had to get a copy.Jeff Bridges & Robin Williams are solid and expertly cast in the movie. Jeff Bridges has grown through the years as a commanding presence on-screen, and with Williams - even though he is known for mostly comedy - when given the right role can really shine with pathos and dramatic sincerity.After ordering from Amazon.com, it arrived within two days and I was enjoying the movie on Blu-ray!"
2,POOR LENS!,I purchased this tele converter lens as an add on to my Canon PowerShot S60. Boy was I disappointed. Let me first say that you first have to purchase an adapter to use this lens with my model (S60). Not a big deal since the adapter wasn't too expensive. The bad news is that the lens and adapter do not feel secure. As far as performance....the lens does what is says (brings in the shot 2X). However the images taken with the lens are terrible. The lens feels bulky and leaves a dark spot in the lower right hand corner of all images taken with the lens on. Do not purchase this lens. Stick with the built in digital zoom instead and don't waste your money.
3,So Big It Blocks the Flash,"I have just received this lens and have only tried using in in low-light environments, but immediately noticed a fairly serious problem in that the lens is so large it actually blocks the light from the flash from reaching the subjects and causes large shadows to appear in the lower right-hand third of every photo. Otherwise, the quality of the photos was good, so I expect it will work quite well in situations where the flash is not needed. It would have been nice to know ahead of time about the effect on flash photos before I made the purchase."
2,marginal utility for low-light close-ups,"I bought this lens to take some close-up shots of stationary items under low to moderate light environments. It is utterly useless for that application. The lens blocks the flash and you get a dark photo with a near-black 40% swatch in the lower right of the frame. It may be useful for those who plan to use it outdoors or in bright light situations, but if you're looking to take close-ups indoors, save your money."
1,Canon Telephoto TDC 10,This is not worth any amount of money if you take even a small amount of pride in your photos. Sadly it is the only one I find available for an otherwise acceptable camera but the pictures are terrible even using a tripod. Blurry and washed out. But what did I expect a 1200mm zoom lense for $80 bucks? You get what you pay for. I read other negative reviews on this lense but thought I might get better results.
3,Diana The Cutting Edge?,"don't bother with this ""strange autobiography"". It is reminiscent of Radcliffe Hall without the angst and certainly no page turner."
3,it's ok,"cons:ok, i bought this knife a couple years ago from academy sports and outdoors. about a week later some problems started to surface. one of the screws started to pop out, i kept fixing it but eventually it just fell out and stayed out. i had to put it back together with some duct tape, also, the blade doesnt come very sharp but is easily sharpened.pros:good tools, saw could be sharper thoughawesome wooden gripa good starter multitool."
2,This is a gerber???,"I purchased this tool for my father as a small stocking stuffer. I figured you can never have enough Multi-tools and I loved the wood handle. I bought it becaused it claimed it was made by Gerber. When the box came I found the bits to be rusted and the spring in the pliers bad. I check the box and can find no reference to Gerber on it. I suppose it could be made by a division of Gerber, but it is not there usual quality even if this is a low end of there product. I do love the way it looks and the quality of the blades, so I will see if I can clean the bits, but I am dissapointed."
4,quality,"sent this as a gift , arrived fast and the product is of fine quality.With the name ""Winchester"" I would not expect anything different."
3,ok value,"I guess you can't expect too much for 15 bucks,but I did expect the blade to have some sort of an edge... Has some good plyers,but overall I would spend the extra money and get a leatherman."
4,"Love this book, but check the measurements before ordering!","I LOVE the Jillian Jiggs books, I had them when I was little and now read them to my daughter, and she loves them too. As a book review, this is a great addition to the Jillian Jiggs collection!BUT I was very disappointed when my copy arrived in the mail. $4 for a book that measures about 5x5 inches - it's tiny and hard to read because it's so small! Please be sure to check the measurements before you order. Apparently it's been printed in pamphlet size as well as full size - be sure you get the one you want!"
5,This is a great book!!!,The whole book rhymes so I loved reading it. The kids loved listening to it and I promised to buy what we need to make our own wonderful pigs (there are instructions in the book)This book is very highly recommended.
5,See em live.,this band is the best band in the world. hands down. see them live. milwaukee is the best city in the world.
1,Only five of the eight cartoons are Betty Boop,"The title of this DVD is misleading. Of the eight cartoons, only the first five are Betty Boop. The other three are irrelevant. The quality of the picture is poor."
2,Check out before you buy,"The product looks ok. The buttons are nice and big and easy to read. They don't work very well though. For example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often I have to press it several times and just right for it to work. It does not come with the AC adapter and Northwestern Bell no longer makes or distributes them. Without the adapter the lights do not work, including the message waiting light. It is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter. I have tried several stores such as Radio Shack, Best Buy, Walmart and Target to find an adapter (120VAC to 6V 100mA) and cannot find one. I have not been able to find one online either. Also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 AA batteries. It does not. This one takes 4 AAA batteries. Not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me, but the description is not accurate for the item. I am sending it back."
4,SpeakerPhone,"This phone has no mute button, which made it absolutely useless for the application intended. I would not recommend if you need this option, otherwise, the phone was very nice."
4,Northwest Bell 11,Phone works fine. I like the one touch memory buttons. They would be better if there was more room to put name on each button.
1,Do not buy a NWB phone,After having my old phone for 40 years I bought a new NWB phone due to remodeling. It lasted 5 months. You cannot get through on their help line and they do not answer their e-mail. Buy a NWB phone at your own risk. I had to buy another phone--AT&T and it works fine.
1,northwestern bell 76510 corded speakerphone,This is a real lemon. The volume does not work properly and distorts the sound. The touchtone keys stick even though I have had this phone less than 6 months. I would like my money back.
2,Caller ID Stopped Working on Day 3,"Love this phone.....if only the Caller ID would work! It worked fine on day 1, day 2 worked on and off.....day 3 Caller ID not working. Tried moving the phone to different outlets, removing the batteries & putting them back in, tried new wire etc.... The phone works great otherwise. Loved the Caller ID when it was working--much larger than most and easy to read. Oh well!"
2,"Good Phone, Lousy Customer Support","I actually like the phone quite a bit. It works pretty well in almost every regard. Sound quality is very good, buttons are easy to find and use, and the feature set is pretty good. Overall, a nice phone and a good value.However, this item is advertised as having 20 number memory, which is 10 ""one touch"" and 10 ""two touch"". I have not been able to get the two touch feature to work.I tried calling the customer support number. I could never get an answer. I was always put on a queue, waited for a couple of minutes, and then offered a voicemail option or dropping the call. I left messages, and never got a call back. I (twice) tried recalling immediately after getting booted. I tried for an hour. No joy. Don't buy Northwestern Bell Phones unless you are sure nothing will ever go wrong."
1,Unfortunate,"Somehow I had the impression that the phone had a ""Message Waiting"" LED indicator. But what they don't tell you is that the same LED is used to indicate ""missed calls"" - which to me makes the LED totally worthless. The phone I had before used the same light, but it flashed green for missed calls, and flashed RED if there was a message waiting. This phone makes no distinction between the two. I had plugged the phone into a phone line just to see how it operated ... I never even got so far as to hang the phone on the wall before judging the message waiting 'issue' cause for stuffing the phone back into the box."
1,Phone is Dead On Arrival,"Phone did not work at all. first of all, the seller did not send the AC adapter, i had to order it. Then when it came, the phone did not work at all. The only thing that worked was the caller ID and that is the only reason why I gave it 1 star."
5,One of the classics and best books I recommend.,I needed at least an year preparation to understand and receive the information and messages in this book. Read all of Norma's books in the order it was published.
1,Mom of 3,"After reading this book, I can now see why Washington State's OSPI is in such a terrible state. Could someone please set Washington's educational system free from its New Age Mentality?"
5,Uplifiting,This book was recommended by a friend. A real page turner and reconfirms what I have always thought to be true. I highly recommend this book to you.
4,Martha opines,"Robin Lee Hatcher is on my favorite authors list. I've read most all of her books. This one is a heartwarming, totally absorbing read! As always, I love books that encourage, uplift and share my Christian faith. This is well-written,characters are so real and the story is good to the amazing end."
4,Love this Dictionary!,The Ultimate Business Dictionary is absolutely wonderful. It contains all the different kinds of business terms one can think of. I like that the book provides examples for some of the terms to help better explain the term being defined. I also like the facts and figures section in the back of the book. I have yet to find a business term not included in this dictionary. I would highly recommend this dictionary to business students and business professionals alike.
4,A New Spin on an Old Queen!,"Fans of Tudor history will enjoy this meaty volume which delivers a very different take on the life of Queen Katherine Howard...she is hardly the hysterical and promiscuous girl so often depicted. Especially interesting characterizations of ""Bloody"" Mary Tudor and Henry VIII, as well. Strictly for fans of the subject, however, or otherwise tedious reading."
5,Fave Queen,"I loved this book. The author writes in a beautiful style, and you really get the feel of Old England from it."
5,Cindy lou rocks!!!,"I know cindy lou personally and have been seeing her each moring this week at my art camp. She is a great musician, left alone an amazing guitarist. She deserves 5!!!"
5,a classic,"sure it isn't a cowboy movie, but it is john wayne at one of his best. the drama, the acting, and the cast... superb movie. has the characteristic barroom fights and everything that is the duke!!"
4,Daytime drama goes widescreen.,"As a tribute to oil-field fire fighting legend Red Adair, this incredibly formula 70's action picture (think Airport) over loads with talent then takes an extra 30 minutes or so just so everyone has something to say.Soapy story starts with hard-as-nails Chance Buckman (John Wayne), who fights fires with a vengeance-so far his profession has cost him his marriage and distanced him from his only child, Tish (Katherine Ross), a headstrong young filly. Toss in Buckman's protegee, Greg Parker (Jim Hutton), the young buck, himself a fearless firefighter by day, ferocious playboy by night.Will Tish's re-entry to her father's world upturn the apple cart? Will she tame Greg and settle into a union the Cleaver's might envy? Will passing years cause Chance to take a softer look at the world? Will he return to the woman he left behind?Or will their entire world be turned upside down in that next big fire up ahead?Enjoy."
5,Love John Wayne,"Hellfighters, has always been one of my favorite John Wayne movies. It shows his toughness and his tenderness. Great action too. It's the kind of movie the whole family can watch together."
2,"Duke takes a 'Chance""...","The action scenes with the burning oil wells were top notch and quite the spectacle and the humor came off well, but beyond that the film kinda sagged. It really suffered when the Duke was not onscreen. I found myself fast forwarding through those scenes. It was good to see Duke in a more contemporary film and his performance/character was right on par with what you'd expect from the man. Well worth seeing for the special effects on the five or so oil fires but I feel it would collect some dust on my shelf."
2,The Duke saves it,I found the film was poorly directed and photographed. It didnt have a good flow to it. The Duke saves an otherwise poor movie.
5,movie,i was shocked that i found a movie releaswed in 1968 on dvd this is the one john wayne movie i like will recommend to friends
4,This is when men where men and the equipment was just as big,Any thing to do with John Wayne the all action hero saw it when i was at school many many years ago and still remember it well when oil was plentyfull and how Red Adair would tackle oil well blow outs stilll a great move.
3,Gift,Bought this as a present for my father-in-law. He is a big fan and it was the only movie missing from his collection. Well it was new and the packaging was great. Movie played great and iwas shipped faily quick.
4,Who else but John Wayne could play Red Adair,"Loosely based on the life and career of Red Adair, I find this movie a joy to watch not only because I am a big fan of John Wayne, but also because of the fascinating job of being an oil well firefighter. Yeah, there is some soap to it with the love stories between Wayne and Vera Miles as well as Katherine Ross and Jim Hutton, but its not ridiculous or over the top, and I think the stories portrait how such a dangerous profession can have an effect on the families of the men who do it. The friendship between Wayne and Hutton's characters come through, and the play between them will keep you chuckling, especially when their relationship as friends grows to Father-in-law/Son-in-law."
5,Hell fighter is awesome,Don't think this is a cheap copy of the movie. It's an original DVD version that was rereleased several years ago. I couldn't believe that I had found a new copy. The sound and picture quality were awesome! It was shipped in a timely manner and I would highly reccommend anyone to buy this movie from this seller.
5,Great riff fodder,"I first saw this movie at the drive-in when it was released in the '60's, when me and my brother were kids. Big and brawling, it's been one of our favorites ever since.It's been on TV a lot recently, and I watched it everytime I could catch it. I've found myself riffing off some of the cheesy dialogue, and laughing myself silly watching Katherine Ross trying to act her way out of a paper bag.Great movie and I highly recommend it."
5,DVD Purchase,This was a Christmas present for my sister. She had been looking for this dvd for quite sometime. You would have thought it was a million dollars the way she reacted! She is extremely pleased with this gift.
3,just watch it,"I have probably seen this movie way more times than any human being should have, and it is truly a garment I wear proudly. Watch it alone, watch it with your colleagues, watch it drunk or sober, just watch it. You are under obligation to yourself.ClonusAlucarda"
5,A superb recorder for the price!,"I've had my YRA-302B for years, and find it to be hands down the best recorder for the money. True, moisture builds up quicker than with a wooden recorder, but the sound easily beats out other plastic recorders. The amount of breath control needed is considereable, but this is actually a good thing. One can get into bad habits with a recorder that allows a hard blow, and recorders that allow hard blows tend to have worse tone.So yes, it'll take some practice to avoid shrieking on it, but trust me, the rewards will be great, because that same sensitivity allows one to do modifications of tone. The YRA-302B is a recorder that you can make talk, and it's not gaggingly expensive!"
3,...its big...,"i thought it was gonna be small but it is thick and big for a recorder. i am 27 years old and my fingers have a hard time connecting properly to the holes, that and i have a hard time tuning it so that it can play properly...that's about it... did i mention it was big..."
3,Yamaha Alto Recorder,"The recorder meets my need for it at present, but I expected a better quality instrumentbecause it was labeled as a 'professional' recorder. However, the price was low, so Iam satisfied with it for practice."
3,Turkey early 1930s,"(from a seller's ad:) ""The Turkish Transformation: A Study in Social and Religious Development"" by Henry Elisah Allen; Chicago University Press, 1935; {251 pp.}. Topics covered include: Penetration of the West; Turkey's Resentment Against The Religious Incubus; The Rush to Westernize Under Kemal Ataturk; Turkey's Changed Status in The Family of Nations and in The Moslem World; The Construction of a Loyal, Unified Population; The New Spirit in Turkey's Social Institutions; Missionary Education in the Light Of Nationalism; The Place of Islam in the New Turkey. [Interesting picture of Turkey in the years following the establishment of the Republic.]"
1,NO!NO!NO!,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. ... He makes incredible errors of historical fact-well known historical fact, at that. For heaven's sakes never mind his errors regarding the women's lives, he puts Warm Springs (where FDR died) in West Virgina instead of Georgia(and where were his editors?) His lack of understanding of the truth of women's lives is no worse than many otherwise credible male biographers. Read it with a spoonful of salt, and you will learn of many women who have been overlooked. Just know going in that you are reading what amounts to a shallow overview magazine type article. Not unenjoyable just disappointing. I ignored the whole rating thing which is absurd."
2,"It's just ""whole language""","Get a good book on ""whole language"" if that's the teaching method you want to use. Better yet, use a good phonics-based approach that also emphasizes the ""whole word"" approach. There's nothing magic in this book for children with Down Syndrome, and the suggested materials are time-consuming to make. My child now reads well, having learned all the ""word attack"" skills, rather than just one word attack skill, which is what ""whole language"" amounts to."
5,turn a site into a web APPLICATION... start with this book!,"Active Server Pages technology rocks! This is the easiest way to harness web database power. Turn your clients' web sites into interactive WEB APPLICATIONS today. Learn how to easily use built-in web server objects to pass data between your web pages, and to and from your server using Request, Response, Application, and Session. Discover the global.asa file which maintains your application & session objects. Learn about the built-in server component for database support, ADO, and its Connection & RecordSet objects. Brush up on your SQL commands so that you can customize your database queries. I went from non-programmer to intermediate-level ASP developer in less than a month. Find an ISP that hosts the IIS or chiliSoft ASP web server, and read these great books to learn how to get your Web APPLICATION up & running this week: ASP for Dummies --> Beginning ASP 2.0 --> Professional ASP 2.0 and ADO 2.0."
1,Get with the times,"For those who don't want to be dragged into the new .net world. There is still asp...however, 2.0 is the old version, at least get 3.0"
2,Dont waste your money,"I was bitterly disappointed by this book. I found it mentions techniques that are possible, then fails to explain their implementation, which is extremely frustrating. Many of the fundamental aspect of ASP are covered all to briefly, leaving the reader confused later on in the book.Take my advice and look at the offerings from the Wrox programming range instead"
3,It is only good for short preview,"This book does not provide enough complete examples, so I need to buy another more comprehensive book to learn more about ASP. Anyway, if you want to know what ASP is, this dummies book is still good."
3,maybe,"I've read good books, and I've read bad books... I've learned HTML and JavaScript with the use of self help how to books, but this is one that I will have to call a disaster. The organization is good, but it downplays a lot of the powerfull features of the technology while over qualifing those who shouldn't even attempt it."
4,Good Introduction to ASP,This is a good introduction to ASP. It is easy to read and covers the material well. Perfect for the programmer who is looking for a start with ASP. I would not recommend this as a library reference.
3,"Good for starting, but ...","I started this book with little knowledge of ASP. I finished this book with a decent beginnings into the language, but by no means a mastery of it. First, the examples in the book - particularly the Classy Classifieds - were not annotated nearly well enough. A lot of the later examples assumed you knew stuff about SQL commands and did not make much of an attempt to explain them. I got some really neat stuff out of the book, but a week and a half after having gotten it, I need to get a more advanced ASP book in order to do more useful things."
4,Surprisingly Interesting,"Had to read this for school & was at first put off by its irrelevance to anything current. However, was completely drawn in & swept away. A really good read - moving & timeless."
1,BOOOOORING,"If you are looking for anything with any kind of story or plot at all, this is not the book for you. Simply an endless string of loosely related paragraphs. If you want a book that you cant put down, look elsewhere. This may be more appropriate in a literature class, but definitely not for a good-time-read."
4,Voices From Beyond the Grave!,Ever wonder how your life is going? Former residents of Spoon River are allowed the last word as they speak about their failures and triumphs from their final resting places. More than a few secrets are revealed as well.
4,Need these for to make extra brigdes,My son loves these but they do come loose sometime depending if he's a little rough with his trains.
3,Hot Shots,"Maybe it's just because I haven't seen Top Gun, but when I first saw this film I was absolutely clueless. Yeah, there were some funny parts and humor from the makers of Airplane, Naked Gun, and Mafia, but the plot fell a little short. Charlie Sheen plays Topper Harley and follows his fathers footsteps when he flies in the Navy. There's also other great appearances by Cary Elwes and Lloyd Bridges (getting a little older), and silly characters like Washout and Dead Meat. I suggest you see Top Gun first, maybe then you will get more of the jokes. I give credit to Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft, though, because Top Gun seems like a tough movie to spoof."
3,Okay,I enjoyed this movie it had some funny gags and jokes but some of the gags and jokes worked and some didn't and it isn't as funny as Airplane or Naked Gun but I really like Charlie Sheen he was very good in this movie. I would recommend that people rent this first before deciding if they want to buy it unless they have already seen it and really like it enough to add to their collection.
3,Did I mention pratfalls?,"You don't need a lot of brainpower to absorb this movie. It goes for the cheapest laughs it can find. To name three: pratfalls, pratfalls and more pratfalls. Sometimes it works -- especially when Lloyd Bridges is on the screen -- and sometimes the jokes fall flat. You're bound to get a few chuckles, and at only 90 minutes, it's doesn't require a big time commitment. Some of the jokes are so quick, you might have to watch it over to get them."
3,Top Gun in different way,"Starring Charlie Sheen, Hot Shots is a parody of Top Gun with a flavor of Airplane thrown in. Funny, Stupid and Silly action make this a must RENT. If you really like this you might want to buy it just to view it's comedy again and again. The Sequel(Hot Shots: Part Deux) is alright, nothing special.I recommend Airplane if you liked this movie."
5,The ultimate comedy of all time,"Put simply, this is one of (if not THE) greatest spoof comedies off all time. I have literally seen this movie over 50 times and it NEVER ceases to make me laugh uncontrollably. Lloyd Bridges has to be the funniest character in the movie...hands down. This movie needs a 10 out of 5 star rating, but this is as high as I can select :0)Where in the heck is the DVD???????????"
4,Great fun,"A hilarious movie, made moreso by the fact that the acting and plot are universally better than what you'd find in the object of it's spoofing, ""Top Gun."" The film is loaded with Abrahams's usual sight-gags, puns, slapstick, and quick wordplay. There's always something going on in the background, making for fun repeat viewings. The overall cheesiness of the special effects really adds to the overall experience. Besides that, it's educational, too! You'll never again wonder what a chafing dish is."
4,Hot Shots dvd,This is a way out there comedy. Like the Scary Movies and Airplane movies. If you like comedy like that you can't go wrong here. And it's funny seeing the Two men from Two & a half Men before that show together.
3,Hot Shots just ok,"Upon watching this spoof on Top Gun, it was kinda funny but nothing I would have purchased. I would have rented it once and called it good. But now we own it so maybe the grandkids would like to see it."
3,Great voices. Alwful mise en scene.,"Singers are great. Director or produces should not be allowed to alter or modify in such a way the original idea and even worse, to add noise that modifies the music."
5,A Superb MPB album,"Lulu Joppert is a superb Brazilian singer, composer, producer way overlooked and underrated; and this her second CD ""Encontro"" = ""Meeting"" or ""Encounter"" is a testimony of that; a very vibrant production, full of life, full of great musicianship and with awesome vocals; we can only hope that this and her previous CD ""Dance With Me"" be reinstated for the sake of wonderful music.And hopefully new albums by this great Brazilian Diva may also be released soon (check her out also in the ""Michael in Bossa CDs).One of the best examples how Magnificent MPB (Brazilian Pop Music) can be, period..."
3,Now in Widescreen,"Kudos to Universal for reissuing ""The Front Page"" in wide screen (and enhanced for 16x9 televisions). The first DVD version, released in 2001, was in full screen. ""The Front Page"" may not be the best version of this story (""His Girl Friday"") but it isn't the worst either (""Switching Channels""). And any film directed by Billy Wilder and featuring the team of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau is worth a look."
3,"Okay, but not as good as the original or first remake...","This is the remake of a remake. The original ""Front Page"" (1931) was a great movie. It was remade in 1940 as ""His Girl Friday."" This 1974 remake is not quite as good as the original or the first remake, but is 10 times better than the 1988 remake (""Switching Channels""). The main problem with this movie is that the attempt at ""adding jokes"" distracts away from humorous situations. Carol Burnett's performance as the killer's girlfriend is absolutely horrible. All that aside, it is still an entertaining story, but stick to the original or the 1940's remake."
5,Front Page,"This a classic, from the Ben Hecht, James McArthur play of the same name.With Jack Lemmon as Hildy Jhonson and and Walter Mathau as his editorWalter Burns, it is a laugh a minute."
5,Pleased with item and Amazon,Very pleased with the DVD [Front Desk] and the service I received from Amazon.Carlos Bonner
4,'The Front Page' pleases with smart humor,"If you are a journalism nerd or just enjoy a good laugh, ""The Front Page"" is a good choice. The movie is set in 1920s Chicago follows the story of Hildy Johnson (Jack Lemmon), who is the top reporter for newspaper editor Walter Burns (Walter Matthau). Hildy decides he wants to get out of the newspaper business and get married, but Walter doesn't want to lose his ace just as the biggest story of the year breaks out.The laughs are many, but only if you listen to the banter between the characters because there isn't a lot of physical humor.Also, from a journalism standpoint, it does provide an interesting look at what journalism was like, even if it is exaggerated a great deal.From my standpoint, it was kind of fun to see Lemmon and Matthau when they were younger, too. They are a great, comedic duo.I recommend this movie, but remember, you have to pay attention a little to get all the jokes and appreciated the cleverness."
3,Ok but not great,"This is an ok album; not particularly strong, but not bad. It was released in 1971 and peaked at 33 on the US album chart and 12 on the country album chart. It did better in the UK reaching 7 on the album chart. The title track, ""Love Letters"" was originally released as a single in 1966 and was a top 20 hit in the US and top ten in the UK. The song ""Life"" was a minor hit in 1971 reaching 53 on the US singles chart and 34 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It's flip side ""Only Believe"" was a top ten country hit. It has a couple of up-tempo tunes on it that are pretty good, ""Got My Mojo Working"" and ""Cindy, Cindy""."
5,just like grandma's,So glad I found this! It's exactly like the one my Grandma had (minus the written notations and cooking stains!). I love the recipe for Ethel's sugar cookies. It's my all-time favorite.
5,Cookie Doodle Doo,"I got this book on a Friday and the very next day I was baking delicious treats from it,for soldiers over seas! Mmm mmm mmm, Chocolate Crinkles! I wish I had this whilegrowing up! Like some have said, it is for the novice or the master. If you love to bake,this cookie book if just for you."
5,Best Cookie Cookbook out there,I actually received one of these in my teens and it got misplaced during a move. I HAD to replace because it is the BEST tried and true cookie book!
5,My go-to cooky book for over 40 years!!,"I bought this cookbook well-over 40 years ago. It was my ""go-to"" cookie recipe source. Infortunately, I lost mine 4 or 5 years ago. I thought I would never find another one, since it was so old. Then, I posted on a forum at Taste of Home, looking for someone who would share some of the recipes I always used at Christmas. One of the ladies told me about the bout being re-printed, she sent me the link to Amazon. THERE IT WAS! I purchased 1 for myself, as well as 1 for each of my 5 adult children. When I asked each of them if they would like a copy, they all said yes. They had very fond memories of sitting and browsing through the book and helping me make cookies from the book, as children. Needless to say, all 6 of us love our new books. You are a lifesaver. Oh--and I ordered on Christmas day and they were here 2 days later! What service!! Thanks, so much!!!ToniMOM of 5 & GOMMY of 5"
5,Great classic cookies,This is a wonderful cookbook of classic cookie recipes and it includes many photos. The cookies are delicious and easy to make. There are recipes from many countries and a section on the best cookies of different decades. Three generations of our family have enjoyed the original edition and we are thrilled to be able to buy copies of the new edition for our grown children.
2,Not so yummy looking,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. None of the pictures of cookies in the book actually look good to eat. They look like they would be ideal in decorating the witch's house from Hansel and Gretel but I wanted cookies to eat not enjoy visually. I like the retro look but for cookies that are meant to be eaten, I recommend the Cookie Bible. Everything in that book looks and tastes great."
5,A very welcome trip down Memory Lane,"When my old copy of Betty Crocker's Cooky Book literally started to fall to pieces, I was delighted to discover that it had been reprinted in a facsimile version, and even more thrilled to receive my copy. This book is, indeed, a dead ringer for the original edition, and I'm sure that anyone who remembers the original with fondness or who just has a liking for 50s and 60s vintage cookie recipes will love it as much as I do. I'll be buying another copy of this eventually, so that my daughter, who grew up on these recipes, can have her own copy to take with her when she leaves home."
5,Great!,This was a gift to replace the same book my Mother had given my sister which she had lost in a fire. It was in even better condition than I had expected! I know it made my sister very happy...
5,Cooky Book,One of my co-workers had the original and brought it in. This is the best. I gave it as a gift to my daughter who loves to bake.
4,cooky book,I have had a copy of this book for decades and it came up missing.I was so happy to find this one...it came promptly and in good condition
4,Love the Vintage Cooky Book!,"Betty Crocker's Cooky Book is wonderful. It is an exact replica of the same book I grew up on, making cookies with my mom at Christmas time. The recipes are great, and the pictures are all ""vintage,"" reminiscent of the 60's. Some recipes are tried and true--absolutely wonderful and have been passed around at cookie exchanges for decades. The new one might have more updated pictures and a few new recipes, but this one from back when my mom was a new wife is a keepsake that you can share with your own kids when cookie baking time rolls around again in December."
5,Had it since 1977,"I bought this book at an elemtary school book fair in 1977. It has been my family's favorite cookie book my whole life. Now that I am grown with children of my own, I purchased two more (one for each child) to learn from and pass onto their own children.S.C. Colorado"
3,OK,"Lots of cookie recipes, but most are decorative cookies for cookie plates. Not a lot of chewy,gooey cookies."
4,Classic!,I love that this book had a bunch of the classic cookie recipes that my mom and grandma used to make. I bought it for my dad as a Christmas gift since he is getting into baking...lots of his favorites in this book.
2,Lean Servicing??,"I bought the book to learn about Lean Servicing. While Lean Servicing is 50% of the title, it is less than 10% of the text. Just one case study/example."
2,Another hype,Being a certified MBB I was looking for something with more substance. A typical off the shelf book regading Six Sigma methodology and application. I was expecting more from the lean perspective and it absolutely failed at delivering anything regading lean processing. Just another hype to sell the lean manufacturing priciple with a poor execution.
4,Classic Push Toy,"My 15 month old daughter has enjoyed this toy since about 10 months. Before she could walk she would push it along as she crawled. As an early walker, she pulled it behind her, now as a steady walker she pushes it ahead of her, as intended. It's a great, battery-free toy. Dog has solid wood construction with leather ears. I like that the push/pull apparatus is wood rather than string - eliminating the strangulation hazard."
2,For older kids,"I got this for my son and he had such a hard time getting the 4 wheels on the floor at the same time that I had to make a hole on the dogs body to place the stick handle directly there. This helped him a lot.The toy is very durable and cute... don't know, have mixed emotions about it"
5,Best choir he's ever had!,I finally got it! I have been looking for this product for so long. Thank you for having it available.
5,awesome!,"this cd is a MUST for any Dream Street fan!! The new versions of their older songs, and the new additions such as ""With All My Heart"" are GREAT!! GO BUY IT!!"
1,Can They Be Any Worse??,"I'd give this 0 stars. Dream Street is five kids put together to make bad music. This CD sure proves it. Why is the you-can-be-a-pop-star-while-you're-10 thing so ""in""? Buy something more mature like Dido or John Mayer."
1,UGH!,Thank god this group broke up! I defenately dont understand why they were even a group in the first place! Theres no talent there!
1,...Ugh?,"Obviously you people don't know real music. Here's some good bands, in which members play their own instruments instead of making millions off lip singing, like these kids probably do: Linkin Park, Korn,... and I could go on and on. This band'll be gone in a week."
5,Dream Street number 1 fan!,"This cd is sooo awsome. I love chris he is sooo totally hot! I just got a christmas cd and he is on it. With his song i so love, ""wild christmas"" This movie is going to rock. I am so there to see it. this cd is just like their other ones All Awsome. Please get this cd! Chris is the best singer in the whole world!!!"
5,this alb rocks,"i first seen the biggest fan on nick , and unfortuantly it didnt come out in this country (uk) i totally lurve it , the music in the film is great and this album is a must have !!!!!"
5,A Must for all Dream Street Fans,"WOW, this cd is way more then I excepected, I new this cd would be great but.. its soo AWSOME, lets put it that way lol! I think EVERY one should at least listen to all of it, especally pop lovers! GO GET THIS CD DS FANS, IT ROCKS =0)We love you DS now & Forever!"
2,Blah,"I absolutely loved the Dream Street songs on this CD! They definitly could have been the next N'Sync if they stayed together! Ruby Blue songs were cute and all, but they're not exactly my cup of tea... The Chris and Play duet was okay. Chris did awesome! But I really do not like Play's voices at all! Sorry Play fans, but that's what I think! I recomend buying the Dream Street debut CD instead of this soundtrack!"
3,"the greatest,greatest fan","The cd is great!I love dream street,there cute there talented and great dancers.when you listen to the cd you will wish you were the girl in the movie.i would love to meet dreamstreet."
3,geez...,"I just wanted to comment on what Matsudo Kenji said. I make music videos myself, but theres no way to make a video without lipsinking. I mean, since you use different shots, the sound will be different, and it wont soundl ike a song with the sound changing all the time... Anyway, not my type of music, but good enough for teenagers..."
2,"Too generalized, not enough breed specifics!","This book is not written with enough detail, to generalized missing a lot of breed specific info that I already knew. I was not happy with my purchase."
3,why they cut girl's head off,girl is lovely then bad man be nice to her but then he really cut her head off then her eyes fall out - me no like bad man but then dolphin lungerland no like him either and he have funny man the crow to help him punish bad man. then he get into tub with tia maria and everybody so oh yes me too. then he fight in the street and everybody stand around and say yeh cool and then he stab him then him and the crow decide to fight crime forever and marry tia maria.
3,I've seen worse! But not much worse!,"Kung-fu's response to Plan 9 From Outer Space. Sadly, the action sequences cannot compensate for wretched dialogue, stale directing. But Lundgren and Lee do fine with what they're given. And I have this on video! Somebody PLEASE rescure Dolph from this! Did anybody pay money to see this!"
3,showdown in little tokyo,Very good Dolph and Brandon make a good time nice moves and the bad guys you love to hate.
4,Showdown in little tokyo,"I saw this movie on skinamax and fell asleep before I finshed watching it, so I came on here and picked it up for 60 cents.I can't complain about it for what I paid. It's basically Drago (Rocky 4) vs Tsung (Mortal Kombat 1). That pretty much sums up the whole plot. It's a typical guy movie and it shows a very nice full frontal of Tia Carrere ;)It's a good movie, check it out."
5,This is an action movie a woman can enjoy too,Im not one for 80s or early 90s action movies but i did really enjoy this one. Most action movies that have a woman being rescued etc. in it seem pretty cheesy cause the woman usually acts really fake. I admire Tia Carrere and I think she was pretty strong in this film. Who can forget her and dolph getting it on to? Not to be perverted or anything but that somewhat draws a woman into a action movie. I would defintely watch this movie again...and dont worry guys its not a sappy movie or anything but i would defintely watch it on a 2nd date...might get lucky!
3,Showdown In Little Tokyo REVIEW,"Looking for good pointless buddy action? Look no further. Before Brandon Lee's unforunate and tragic death and Dolph Lundren's exile to straight-to-video fare, the two did this average and predictable but fun and fast-paced action film. Lundgren is the American trained in the Hong Kong style while Lee is vice-versa and the two are looking to track down the always-evil Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who is the distributor of a new lethal form of drugs that is killing kids on the streets. If that's not enough, Tagawa murdered Dolph's parents when he was just a child so this is a mission of revenge.At just a little bit over an hour and ten minutes, this movie gets right to the point and fast. You get a whole lot of kicking and shooting but not too much of anything else. If you are a fan of either Lundgren or Lee then it's worth a look but non-action fans may want to skip this."
2,Bottom of the Barrel Actioner,"Summary: Two L.A. cops (Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee) vs the Yakuza (led by Carey-Hiroyuki Tagawa, the murderer of Lundgren's parents).Dumbo martial-arts action movie is short and fast moving enough to end before we are bored. This movie is so forgettable that I forgot about it while I was still watching it. From the director of 'Class of 1984' and 'Commando'."
3,Very good fun.,Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee team up to beat the baddies in a well paced and earnest adventure.
5,"Kinky Interracial sex scene was funny, and cool...","The scene in which Japanese-American actor Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa (who also played the father in the children's TV series, ""Johnny Tsunami"") and the actress playing a *smoking-hot* blonde drug addict engage in sexual ""foreplay"" with the kantana blade was actually very hot, in a cheesy yet very original and sexy sort of way. Totally worth the viewing just for that scene!"
2,For what it's worth....,"If you're out to collect all of Brandon Lee's work, this is an essential. If not, you may want to pass. While the martial arts work is slick, and the dialog is peppered with some good humor, the plot is rather lacking. To top it off, Stephen Glantz (writer) has apparently never actually spoken to a woman, because he certainly can't write for them. Tia Carrere is utterly wasted (yes, even for her skills, this is a waste) in the most unrealistic female character in film. Even her nude scenes are a body double.If your looking for martial arts action you haven't already seen, you could get this one. Just don't get your hopes up."
3,"Great Writing, Ugly Presentation","I read this book many years ago and loved it. I remember Drucker's prophetic comments that a computer didn't make a revolution; you have to have an interlocking network to change people's lives. Electricity, for example, was much more than a light bulb; it was a network that linked people's homes to a source of electricity. I found that insightful and have always wanted to go back and reread Drucker's lucid discussion and see how much of it has ""played out.""Sadly, this book is a sloppy-looking photograph of the original and the cover is ugly. I don't know if the cover picture is supposed to be clouds or a map of something. Perhaps I should have sought an original."
3,It ia very abstract,"This book has a lot of good ideas, but it is too vague, too lack of specificity. It keeps repeating. It is not too bad, but it could This book has a lot of good ideas, but it is too vague, too lack of specificity. It keeps repeating. It is not too bad, but it could have been a better book. been a better book."
4,Finally a readable book on international marketing,"After ploughing through too many dry, long texts its really refreshing to find a book that is not only useful and informative but really easy to read - when you as busy as most of us are it is of paramount importance to get some real value and memorable tips and tricks QUICKLY!"
2,Not real happy,"Product come on time, and was well packed no scratches or dents looked very nice. The real problem was putting them on.. Was not real easy, matter a fact it took me about 3 hours and still feel they are not on perfect.You have to take body mount bolts out then tap bushing away from bolt (so you just have bolt)That was not hard but.....it was attaching them that became the problem..After I had them attached and tightened bolts down ( I tightened them down good ) The GMC truck I have now makes all kinds a noise..(creaks and makes noise when making turns..It did not make NO noise before I put these on.I losened them up a little to maybe stop all the creaking but it still makes noise.I am NOT real happy with this purchase, would I recomend them? NO"
3,Prog beginnings.,"This recording marked Le Orme's entry into the world of prog-rock. Where they had recorded prior to this they tended to be more pop or psychedelia rooted. This is a less refined effort than subsequent efforts but a good one none the less. Cemento Armanti cleverly borrows the melody line from Aqualung. Solos can get a little lost on occassion but overall the playing is solid. Primarily an organ trio on this date, they would more fully develop there sound later on. This one is still worth obtaining but you'd be better off starting with Felona e Sorona, Uomo di Pezza and Contrapunti...Simon"
2,Outdated and non-essential,"Get the following Le Orme albums (in this order): ""Felona E Sorona"", ""Uomo Di Pezza"", ""Contrappunti"", ""Storia O Leggenda"", ""Florian"" and skip the rest. ""Collage"" is forgettable and there's no song on the album that is a keeper. Not a terrible album. Just not that good."
4,Get the Original,Save your money and buy the 6 volume set. Dr. Robertson never intended for this work to be missing his transliteration of the Koine Greek and expected that the scholar would have the W&H text open as the word pictures were being explained. Milk may be good when condensed - this clearly isn't.
4,Very Helpful Set,"You know who A. T. Robertson is. His Greek grammar is the standard against which all other grammars are judged.In this 6 volume set, Robertson analyzes a key word or phrase from almost every passage of the New Testament. Not only does he give the syntax, but he also gives a good deal of background on each word, such as where else it is found, as well as the connotations of the orginial Greek.If you are a pastor, this book will be of great help to you in your sermon preparation. It will give you a good amount of material to draw on for sermon illustrations."
3,None,"Upon an initial glance at one passage (immediately after downloading this volume) I find that it is not completely devoid of the Greek, as another review might lead you to believe. However, it is an abridged edition, containing less information than my hardcover 6 volume set. Overall, I expect it to be a handy quick-reference that will give some insight without too much detail."
1,Only got the NT for luke,"Not the book it should be. I am very disappointed since i got the wrong item. Please do not sell books to people if you are not giving what is shown. On a positive note, I understand we all make mistakes! Please dont do this again however to anyone besides myself. Honesty really is the best policy! God bless you!!!"
4,crunchy snack in convenient 1 oz bags,"These are the best crackers if you like extra crunch and lots of seeds. The bags are great for portion control. The bite size crackers are about an inch square. Put on a small square of cheese and get a real explosion of taste - but be sure to have a beverage on hand, to wash it down."
5,These are great!,"I buy these crackers at my local HEB store, although they are cheaper here at Amazon. I find them to be healthy and satisfy my need for something crunchy. They are very filling as well and easily satisfy my hunger craving. They are very hard, more so than the average cracker, but that is part of the fun! Lastly, they taste great! What more can you ask for!"
4,Connected to Place,"Urban, suburban, rootless, nomadic: if these words describe your experience, this film will leave you cold. Agrarian, transplanted, uprooted, trying to re-connect to a rich family tradition? This film is for you. The plight of a man who is part of the land, and whose land is part of him, really moved me. This film asks, ""What do you value, and why?"" It affirms the worth of connectedness, continuity, and deep roots, while challenging our cultural idols of speed, change, and the new."
4,Racing Beauty,"This is a well written, well research book that combines a political and historical analysis of race. While examining black women the reader gets the bitter taste of racism in American politics. This book crosses multple genres and will be useful in virtually any social science and humanities courses.I also think that the lay reader will find this book interesting."
4,Additional Equipment Needed,"The sockets work fantastic. I had several lug nuts on my car that were over-tightened when new tires were installed. When I tried to remove them to rotate my tires they completely rounded over. I used Grip-Tite 3/4"" deep socket and wratchet handle to try to remove the lug nuts. The wratchet handle was not strong enough. It kept slipping. The drive size of the Grip-Tite sockets is 3/8"",so I tried using a 3/8"" drive breaker-bar(not included in the set). There simply was not enough leverage to loosen the lug nuts. I then used an adapter drive (3/8"" to 1/2""drive)(not included in the set)in order to use my 1/2"" drive breaker bar. This worked fantastic. I got all the lug nuts off easily."
3,Interesting concept,"Have not tried to use it on any ""problem"" jobs that the advertisement describes and have only used one size so far, however, on about the third nut I tightened one of the fingers broke. Have not contacted anybody about that yet so do not know how they will respond. Be aware that the walls are a little thicker than regular sockets so you cannot get into as tight a space as others. I do like the way they hold a bolt or nut as you try to insert them into close quarters."
3,a bit cheaply made,"i have had a few of these sockets break, they are very cheaply made, the walls are too thin, the teeth that bite the bolt head are too weak, I would not of minded paying more for a more durable product, when it comes to removing a bolt that has a bolt head that is rounded, the job has then become bad already, need a good quality tool."
2,Missing scene & worn video master Alpha/Gotham DVD.,"This is a passable-for-the-price DVD, but looks like a good VHS picture. Obviously a WORN OUT video tape was used as the mastering source for this DVD, there are some glitches & mis-tracking lines that come & go.THE PICTURE IS SOFT!There is also a portion of the opening scene MISSING! On the Platinum Disc ""EAST SIDE KIDS: 8 MOVIES"" box set, this movie starts with the boys trying to paint a wall. THEN Muggs enters asking about the mailman (this is where the Alpha/Gotham DVD starts)."
2,The East Side Kids get into horseracing.,"Well, the East Side Boys finally made it out of the haunted mansion inEast Side Kids - Boys of the City(1940). They are suppose to be painting a wall in town, but Leo Gorcey has decided he wants to be a jockey. Knuckles (Dave O'Brien) and Algy (Eugene Francis) must keep an eye on this gang to make sure they finish the job. They made a mess of it, so Knuckles told them to go hide at there old stable hang-out. The boys decide to race a throughbred they own called, Blue Knight. If Seabiscuit could win and make money for everyone, so could Blue Knight. After all, the horse is from Kentucky. Guess who they train to be the stable jockey? Muggs. The boys are: Bobby Jordan, Leo Gorcey, Sunshine Sammy Morrison, David Gorcey (Leo's younger brother) and Donald Haines. The next films are:Pride of the Bowery (1941)(1941), FLYING WILD (1941), BOWERY BLITZKRIEG (1941)."
2,Mormons Awake!,"This guy just ""cans"" Mormonism, as he ""cans"" pretty much every ""faith"" other than his own, whatever that may be. I'm NOT Mormon and don't hope to be - but I did expect some sort of unbiased reporting from someone with an ""open mind"". He professes ""Christianity"" and tells us to keep to the ""straight and narrow"". But what exactly are HIS own views, and let's see him review THEM candidly and without bias. He forgets to mention that Christianity (per se) has so many ""holes"" in it that we shouldn't believe ANY of that, either. To each his own, I suppose."
5,A Mind that found itself,"This is about a yale man who ended up in a mental hospital in the 1900's.He was cured and committed his life to changing the abuses of the industry.Thur him the Mental health associations were formed, now Mental Health of America.If you read this book it will change you life forever."
3,All work and no play makes for an unhappy hedgehog.,"One beautiful day the little hedgehog Mikko is sent out of his beloved garden by his Grandfather Tarek. It seems that Tarek thinks Mikko is lazy and needs to get motivated to make something of his life and earn his happiness. What Mikko sees are a group of animals suffering to make happiness. A gentle narrative voice and some pretty pictures make the story an entertaining read, but the message is poorly presented and weakens the lesson Mikko learns and passes on to his Grandfather."
1,Misguided attempt at teaching simplicity in life,This book attempts to teach young children about how to lead a simple life but instead tells them its bad to try to improve themselves. It's the only children's book I've ever thrown away.
3,I missed something here...,"""Signs of Life"" is well written, but is overly dependent on a story universe I know nothing about.In addition, Wilder introduces a lot of characters. Some of these characters were rather interesting (like the androids), although most just further diluted the story. I think the reader would have been better served with a simpler presentation providing more background.If you have been following Wilder's work in other books or magazines you will probably get a lot out of this book. I've never read anything by this author. As such I was as much a castaway as the survivors of the ""Serendip Dana""."
1,"Too bad, because the premise was good","I picked this up and read the back and the blurbs and it sounded like it would be interesting, if not a good read. Unfortunately, this book was bad from the first paragraph on. There were so many names and characters just thrown at me, I could hardly tell when the story started to advance. The immediate establishment of the military guys bad, us civillians good, was also irritating, since neither side was able to prove themselves anything other than their labeling. I was so confused after the first sixty pages, I had to give up. The book had gone from confusing to impossible to follow. At that point, I'd already lost interest in the characters, since I could hardly tell what was going on, and could have cared less about their fates."
2,what use is astrology?,"Too technical, too work shop based, for the professionals only, not the book I was hoping for."
2,I'm sure it's useful if you could read the print!!,This Concordance has the SMALLEST print I've ever seen in ANY book!! Even with my reading glasses I have to squint in order to make out the print. I even tried a magnifying glass but gave up. I don't know who would able to use this book. I wasted my money since I can't even read it!!
4,Angels - Good or Evil,"My wife and I enjoyed this movie. We had only caught the last of it on the History channel and saw that it wasn't coming back for a long time, so we knew we could buy it from 'Amazon sellers' at a good price. We will watch it again in a few months."
5,Buy This Record!,"I saw these guys play for about 15 people at CBGB last summer -- it was handsdown one of the best performances I ever saw to an nearly empty room.I find it offensive that they get slapped with the ""hardcore"" label. They're a band that plays for the love of their own music while not being preachy about it. Very few bands that wave the banner of ""hardcore"" can even hold a candle to these guys.Something tells me we're going to be hearing a lot more from this band in the not-so-distant future."
4,i prefered one,"as a fan of one, i was initially dissappointed when this arrived in the mail. it seemed to lack the urgency, immediacy and rawness of one. the drums sounded flat and buried in the mix. the guitars sounded weak and i didn't appreciate the mastering [note that i was listening to two through headphones]. once i got home and gave it a blast on the stereo, my opinion changed rapidly. the songs may not be as strong as say polygraph, bloody mary or opposable thumbs but in my opinion this sets two apart from one, in a postive way - instead of releasing an album in the same vein as one, cursed have changed things up. without a doubt the lyrical content is as strong as one. bottom line: if you enjoyed one (and let's face it, if you didn't rate one then you need to have you head checked) you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection. cursed beat the pants off their contemporaries. listen to this loud."
2,Uninspired and Dated,"Glen Campbell has recorded some very fine interpretations of love songs over the past 35 years. This album, even though it's a recent recording, is way below his usual standards. Dreadful arrangements that were probably meant to recapture a 1960's feel and a terribly flat and uninvolved vocal performance on most of the tracks.On top of that, the CD clocks in at barely half an hour of playing time, most of the selections are in the two-minute range. The only halfway decent rendition here is probably Jim Croce's ""Time in a Bottle"" with some nice guitar work. The other eleven tracks drown in female sing-along-choruses and soupy strings that sound as if recorded during a Vegas showroom practise and patched over Glen's uninspried vocals as an afterthought.If you look for moving Glen Campbell ballads check out his work with Jimmy Webb, especially the ""Reunited"" album that gives you 75 minutes of some of his best recordings of the 1970's and 1980's - and they even sound a lot better!"
2,cheep some what effective,patches down release bubbles most just at the ends and it super fragile one broke in half from setting it down on the table to fast . but for 3 $ u get what you pay for perfect for cheep no frills fish tank
2,"Air Stone - 12""","This product didn't meet my expectation. After installing it in my fish tank, I was disappointed to see that there were gaps in where the air bubbles were being dispersed within the air stone causing an uneveness of flowing bubbles."
5,Singer-Songwriter at his best!,"I was given this CD as a gift a few months back, and it hasn't left my CD changer since. I would describe Joseph Arthur as a heady mix between Jeff Buckley and Ryan Adams. He transitions from the elegant, moody introspection of Buckley to the romping alt-country of Adams in a snap without reason or need for apology. He creates rich harmonies through falcetto and intricate bass lines - you'll find yourself singing along with the opening title-track (which will remind you of David Grey), and not stopping until the closing song: ""You've Been Loved"". The CD is melancholy and sweet. He's a fantastic lyricist and underrated talent - you won't regret adding this one to your collection."
4,Sweet and Sour,"Two superbly crafted pop songs seduce us into Arthur's third albumn. Deeply introspective, often perplexed, Arthur sings to save himself, though the rewards are aren't necessarily a renewal of energy. He rarely shakes free of a fog of resignation. This makes the more exhuberant,'Let's Embrace','In the Night',or 'Permission' less convincing, an impression overscored by the inappropriateness of the Gabriel signature sound. For the most part though(and this is a long CD), the production palette is not excessively lavish. 'Termite's Song's' moog & dulcimer mantra recalls the innocence of the Donovan who gave us Songs For Children; fragile, nacrescent as the inside of an abelone shell, held to the ear. By far the better part of the albumn is a genuine treasure. Those enticed by this work may wish to investigate Melbourne's, David Bridie whose ,'Act Of Free Choice' runs in parallel to Arthur's palette."
4,Helpful Genealogy Guide,"I find that trying to get into genealogy is fairly easy & fun, but you can spend an enormous amount of time just getting started unless you have some guidelines. Where do you look for certain records; how do you find old Uncle Joe's third wife; etc? Even with helpful books such as the Idiots Guide, you will still find yourself spending lots of time searching through records, but at least you're being more productive because there are lots of hints & shortcuts. It's a great book to use along with an ancestry site."
3,"Desperately needs to be an online text, not in print","This is a useful reference, but because of the nature of the Internet, the links outdate quickly. It desperately needs to be an online text that can be updated frequently and more readily accessed, as these are very long urls to type in in some cases (only to find the site has been moved). But wait, we have that online resource...it's called Cyndi's list. I haven't found anything in this text yet that was not more easily accessed on Cyndi's list."
5,"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Online Genealogy, Second Edition",Very informative for the novice Genealogist. Helpful hints of where to look for information both online and in the library.
4,Good Introduction to Johnny Clegg,"I liked this album a lot, particularly after visiting South Africa; however, this album is missing some of his more famous songs. For example, how can you have a ""best of"" without ""Impi""."
2,over priced,"I bought a pair last year, which was early style(made in Italy), it was awsome! some how I broke the frame. So I ordered this one from UVEX sport, they described it as made in Italy, but actually made in China. The quality was awful! It slips and the lense had some optical problem. I was forced to returned it after one day. so I glued my old one back and use it as it, and It still works GREAT! All I can say is ""OVER PRICE KNOCK OFF,"""
4,"A great historical film, but sometimes a bit slow","This is a fantastic historical film of Adam Mickiewicz's epic poem, Pan Tadeusz, which deals with the petty squabbles of two noble families before Napoleon's invasion of Russia and how they come together to fight against the Russians. The cinematography was very beautiful and you really get a sense of the landscape. Other people have given the plot synopsis, so I'll just mention that it was very engaging. However, I'm sure it's better if you've already read the poem. I have to admit I haven't. Sometimes the narrative was a bit difficult to follow, and it is true that there were some over long scenes. Sometimes there were typos in the English subtitles. However, despite these issues, it is a film worth seeing, even for those who haven't read the poem."
2,"bolts were defective, customer service was nonexistent","I bought the Legacy 225 crossbow and scope package, which also included a quiver, 3 Horton bolts, and a cocking rope. The crossbow itself seems to be well-made, and is powerful. My problem was with the bolts, and Horton's customer service. After firing the bolts into my block target, the inserts and field points came out of the bolts, and were left inside the target when I went to pull them out. I contacted Horton's customer service department. Horton would not answer e-mail or replace the bolts. Customer service is important to me--if Horton is unwilling to resolve an issue this minor, I'm not waiting to see how they handle a more serious one. I have sold my Horton, and am going buy an Excalibur."
4,"The music is cool, yet raunchy",I think this is one of the best albums from a female i have listened to in the last 10 months. The lyrics:Devine. The music:groovy.
1,Album is sadly over - rated,I was excited when I heard that Fugees' Lauryn Hill was releasing a solo album.If I had known that this album was basically rap I never would have purchased it.Lauryn Hill has a beautiful voice that isn't even used in this album....
1,No negative star option?,"What the hell is this woman thinking. If u r going to swear on a CD, swear. Dont just make the entire cd edited. (O wait she cant, she is supposed to be the great role model) Doo op is one of the worst songz i have ever heard."
1,A HUGE waste of money!!,"Hey people..those of you who feel compelled to either dis or defend this album based on comments the woman may or may not have made in an interview or concert...it has no place here. This is to reveiw the album. So, that said....this was by far the worst $13 I've ever spent. I literally threw it on the shelf after one listen and I'm sure I'll never bother again. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. The Grammy's should be ashamed of themselves for being bullied into handing out awards to be ""politically correct"". Can you say ""Milli Vanilli""? Ugh...this album could signal the downfall of western civilization and true art. Bad...bad...bad."
1,What in hell is this?,"Okay, where do I start? First there is that piano repeating that same annoying motif over and over again in ""Doo Wop"" (DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING all throughout the song) And then some songs like ""Ex Factor"" and ""Superstar"" just drag out and end up putting me to sleep. ""Everything is Everything"" may be the only decent song on the CD. And what are those interludes? I bet twenty minutes of this entire CD consists of those kids talking in class. No wonder this CD was almost seventy-eight minutes in length! Her ideas are good, but maybe she should just write a book instead."
5,The BEST Cd of the Year!,"I love this Cd and listen to it at least once a day. Lauryn has an awesome voice, and it is very versatile. She has great raps, wonderful slow songs, and a nice religious tint to some of them.My favorite song is TO ZION because I think that her voice is the prettiest in this song. It also reminds of the gospel in my church. Then Superstar is my next favorite. Doo Wop is great but they play it too much. Then Every Ghetto, Every City, and finally Forgive Them Father. Hey to Lauryn Hill: thanks a billion for such a great Cd. I can't stop diggin it."
5,An awesome mix of rap and pride,"Lauryn Hill, this year's best new artist (rap and other things), has taken the country by storm with ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"". This only proves to show that the former Fugees star who started her career at 15(?) is an excellent phenomenon on her own. My favorite track was ""Doo Wop"", which had rythem, soul, and heart. Other favorites include: ""Every Ghetto, Every City"", and the remake of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"". Whether you like rap or not (I hate rap), you will LOVE this CD. It should be a good addition to your collection."
5,Versatility.,"Lauren Hill shows that she is extremely versatile and her talent knows no bounds on her album. This is one of those CDs that you pop in and let it play to the very end. This is one for the road trips. Every song has a positive, but not preachy, message and serves as proof that she definitely is a role model to young sisters, and everyone else for that matter. There aren't many albums out there where you can get your slow dance, jam, and just cool out and groove on to. This is one of them. Definitely the album of the year. They just don't write lyrics like these anymore."
1,Why Has L. Hill's Singing Ever Produced Even a Single Fan?,"Why indeed? This will never do -- as one critic, Croaker, said of John Keats. Oh that Ms. Hill was an Emily Dickinson or even a Jennie Lind ... Why the toneless sound, chasing vainly after a melodic line and harmonic consistency? Why the baby-talk intonation? Why the absence of simple voice quality? Can anyone distinguish even a single word -- without cribbing it first from album notes? I see her old CDs are a whopping $2.99. Doubtless that is becuz they have been played down to scratches. (Scatches r better!) It is possible to sing greatly without much voice and a one-octave range, but only if you are Billie Holiday. I knew BH, and Lauryn ... you are no Lady Day!"
1,Most Overrated Album Ever,"I was excited getting this album after hearing the heaps of acclaim from reviewers. What a soulless bore. Neneh Cherry did this with more brains and heart, for god's sake."
3,"Good, but I hope her next one will be better.","Lauryn Hill is the next Stevie Wonder in my opinion. Her songwriting is soulful and smart. But her rapping, after listening to it for awhile, is irritating! I love Hip Hop, but I dont think that Lauryn has the voice for it. ""That Thing"" and ""Cant keep my eyes off of you"" are my particular favorites, but after those two and a few others, I turn the CD off. I am one of the few reviewers on this page who wishes Lauryn would stick to singin and leave the Hip Hop to someone who can really flow."
5,This CD was on my player 24/7!,"Lauryn Hill is truly an inspiration to me. She touches me in the very deepest of my heart in this album. I especially love Ex-Factor, Can't Take My Eyes Off You, Every Ghetto, Every City, and the title of the album, The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill. I remember the first time I discovered Lauryn Hill. My mom rented the video, Sister Act 2 and I was already a fan by then. I was only five at that time. I hope she will produce many more albums like this and may she stay successful forever in all her entertainment business career!"
5,beautiful,"both poignant and dignified, lauryn hill is one of the forerunners in modern neo-soul and hip hop.. she won more grammys before she was 22 than most people ever dream of winning.. and its not without reason. this album really did it for me, particularly the song ""to zion."" a great, must-own album that embraces elements of reggae, hip hop, and soul."
5,Good all the way through!,"It's rare to buy a CD and like every song on it. Lauryn Hill's music is a perfect blend of hip-hop, true R&B, funk, and soul. There's not one throwaway song on this CD. My favorite tracks are probably her two most personal songs, ""To Zion"" and ""Every Ghetto, Every City,"" which speak of her son and her own childhood, respectively. The cameos from Mary J. Blige and D'Angelo are naturals on this soulful collection. Can't wait until the next album."
3,good record but enough already it ain't thriller,"when i first got this record i dug it alright but only thru 8 or 9 cuts.cuz the beats became to predictable.i think shes a good artist with a promising career. however this record isn't the second coming.i'm glad to see her do well and be rewarded.but i think in all honesty shes a better producer than anything. doo-wop was the jam as is to zion. but a rose is still a rose on the Queen,i was made to love him for Whitney and all i can say for mary whips this record up.it's a alright record by a talented person but let's see with the next couple of ones before greatness is bestowed.way to many people are overhyped.if folks were exposed to the really great artist let's say put a hip-hop beat behind roberta flack ,gladys knight or mavis staples give those ladies a fair shake L boggie might still be known but she couldn't hang with those kinds of talent."
3,"Rap 5*, R&B 3*.","Lauren has certainly shown us how to Rap but in terms of R&B this CD lacks a little, with such a beautiful voice, I would hope a little more singing from Lauren, well maybe the next album will shows us a bit more. Fantastic album other wise."
3,"Well, at least she is original!","Even though I detest rap music (unoriginal, copies everyone else's music, totally inane and stupid) at least Lauryn Hill uses her own medleys and lyrics without having to steal from others."
2,Lauryn Hill simply wins by default,"The current status of Hip-Hop--like the current status of Heavy-weight boxing--is rife with cats and chicks taking dives and pulling punches for instant fame, their names in neon and the Big Payoff. As a result, there are no real contenders willing to challenge other artists and listeners. While Hill's album has bright moments, the music is dull and repetitive, her vocal range is limited, and she tends to oversimplify situations. When you put this album within the context of current music, it is being lauded because there is no one out there giving Lauryn a challenge for the lyrical title. And the public, gorged to death on Puffy and those pimping our nostalgia, hungers for a real pugilist."
5,An Instant Classic,"This CD has got to be the best I have heard this year. I had stopped buying CD's because some only contained maybe 2 songs at the most worth listening to and they probably were given so much airplay that you didn't want to hear them again. But this is an exception. Every song on this CD is worth listening to over and over again. Songs like Ex-factor, Forgive them Father and That Thing makes you wonder how someone so young could come up with such words. This is a brilliant and gifted artist and her CD is of the same stature."
1,The Grammy awards don't matter,"The Grammies really don't make a difference. look who was nominated - Shania Twain, Madonna, Backstreet Boys...and Lauryn Hill. Go figure, the committee has poor taste in music. You have to understand that in order to receive a nomination, your album must have sold at least a million copies.Nothing special about this album at all, it sounds just like any other hip hop/R&B album. ""Doo Wop"" is incredibly overrated and overplayed, right down to Lauryn's own Busta Rhymes knockoff in the song. ""To Zion"" and the title track among others make this album quite a drag.If you want to hear a truly amazing album, check out the latest releases by Leah Andreone, Sprung Monkey...or, better yet, the greatest album in the '90s, ""Fantastic Planet"" by Failure. They will truly knock your socks off...this won't."
1,Most Overrated of the year!,"Lauryn Hill music is trash. I love all types of music and why she is so popular is a mystery to me. I do not enjoy her ""music"" at all."
1,Oh GOD is this thing DULL,"Shocking, after all the press, to finally hear this album. Easily among the most pointless, meandering music ever committed to CD, and that's saying a LOT! This could be in the dictionary as the definition for ""bad R&B.""Its kind of ironic, given the flap about Hill's supposedly racist remarks, that she has produced one of the ""whitest"" albums ever. And I don't mean that racially. I mean it in the sense of whitebread -- dull, tasteless, featureless, all fluff and no nutrition.If you want to hear rap, buy Biggie. If you want to hear devotional music, get an old Bob Marley record, or listen to Curtis Mayfield, or hell even Public Enemy. If you want grooves, there's a million good alternatives. Who needs this?"
1,Simultaneously pretentious and moronic,This is even more brain-dead than the average rap CD. She's certainly pretty enough; why can't she hire someone to write her some decent songs to sing? Or one even.
3,Not What I expected.,"I received this cd on time and undamaged, However it seems as if some of the songs are missing. It is a very short cd. Would not recommend this product."
5,My Daily Soundtrack,My Favorite Album of All Time. I listen to it Everyday. I Encourage Those Around Me to Listen to it. I Wish Every Track Would Be Played on the Radio. I Hope and Plan to Meet Ms. Hill one Day So I Can Tell Her How Much She is Loved and How Her Wonderful Creation Has Inspired Me on a Daily Basis. I am Truly a Devouted Fan and FriendSHE IS NOT A RACIST If you carefully listen to her work and when she speaks publically you would realize this. BAD PRESS WOULD MAKE A NEWBORN BABY SEEM EVIL!
5,This album definitely hits the heart.,"I expected Lauryn Hill's album to be hot and she came through. I admire her work for its originality and soulfulness. I thank her for making the album seem personal to all listeners, something everyone can relate to. Since I'm from these streets, bumps, and turns she is speaking of, it makes it all the better for me. One song imparticular, To Zion, filled my heart up with emotion and made me cry. Overall, this album is one to make everyone think twice about life."
5,Best Album of the Year (easy),"Lauryn Hill has spread her musical wings and taken flight. There is not one weak song on the ENTIRE CD. Buying this CD is money well spent. She weaves HipHop, Soul, and R&B into a potion of potent energy that takes you through every feeling and emotion. I bought it for one song and now cannot resist listening to the entire CD! If you like music, you will LOVE ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill""!"
5,Stimulating voice and touching lyrics,"Lauryn Hill definitely ""keeps it real"" on this album. She talks about very real subjects that anyone who has ever been in love, or thought they were in love can relate to. Her lovely voice, lyrics and jazzy beats define what music should be like."
3,If expect every song to sound like Lost Ones then pass.,"It's not bad for a first album. I would have given it 4 stars if the interludes were separate tracks and not tacked on at the end of songs. The only thing in common with other Refugee albums is the positive message. The music is averge. I think some of the beats were even partially sampled from some of Wu-tang's songs. Although the music is average, the lyrics and Lauryn's lovely voice aren't. Most of the songs are a nice blend of rap and vocals. I think the best songs are: (track 2)Lost Ones, (5)Doo Wop (That Thing), (6)Superstar, (10)Forgive Them Father, (11)Every Ghetto,Every City, (13)Everything is Everything, (15)Bonus track. If you like Lauryn's voice and songs like Killing Me Softly, you'll definitely like this album."
5,Soul in the age of hip-hop,"Lauryn Hill / The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill: An obvious fan of the soul of Marvin Gaye and the power of Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill mixes that past with the beat of late 90's Hip-hop and creates a wonderful and enjoyable sound. That sound is then made part of a brilliantly devastating set of lyrics that turn this album into one of the Greatest of the era. Five Stars."
5,One of the top ten must-have recordings,This CD has blown me away since it came out. I think it was the best CD of the 90s.
5,one of my favorite albums,"I was always a Fugees fan but this really made me realize just how talented Lauryn Hill is. Every single song on this album is wonderful. Some of my favorites are ""To Zion"", ""Tell Him"", and ""Every Ghetto, Every City"". This CD is just a real joy to listen to and it makes me respect Lauryn Hill so much. I would recommend this CD to anyone because yes, although it's R&B/Hip-Hop people who usual don't like those genres like this CD, and that is just part of it's great appeal."
5,"Perfect blend of R&B, Reggae and Soul!","This is the perfect album for anyone into Bob Marley type of Reggae, Soulful R&B (The way it should be) and innovative lyrical flows that just emminate poetry through and through.... Perfect for India.Arie, D'Angelo and Bob Marley lovers..."
1,I will save you the trouble of buying it and returning it,"I buy about 3 or 4 cd's per week so when I heard about this one I wanted to get it. I returned it to the store, because it didn't live up to all the hype. I was really disappointed.There was one ok song, but it wasn't worth buying it for that."
1,like a long boring sermon,"This Cd came out in this age of political-correctness, spiritualism, self-introspection, social-issues consciousness, etc. That's why it has won the Grammys. Otherwise, it's just one long boring sermon, exalting Ms Hill's views and beliefs."
5,"The ablum is not only an inspiration, but a true masterpiece","The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a seriously poetic, no- nonsense ablum. This ablum and the artist deserves all that is given to them. There is really nothing more to say than it is heartfelt and a extremely good ablum. It contains nice beats, great lyrics, and an excellent vocalist. The Best! God Bless!"
5,Lauryn Hill Is the best!,"This Cd is a real 5 stars,Lauryn is a great singer/Rapper and the back and forth between Rap and Singing leaves some song in the middle. All the work she put into it is shining now, Every award given to her for this CD she worked for. Every one will and is loving this CD No matter what type of music they leasn to. This CD is a must have."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CDS OF 99,"WHEN I LISTENED TO THIS MUSIC FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS REALLY A SURPRISE. IT MAKES ME DANCE ,IT MAKES ME CALM, THANKS LAURYN FOR SUCH A GOOD MUSIC"
4,"Soul-filled, melodic, rhythms","Lauren is truly an artist not afraid to put it on the line. Her music is a real departure from the ""comfort zone"" of the tasteless lyrics and re-makes of alot of her counterparts. Her Miseducation speaks to the soul, the heart and the mind; she lays down tracks that are soul-filled, melodic and hard to ignore. I am not a big fan of a lot of the immature hip-hop groups around but Lauren and Badu are truly in a class by themselves."
4,This Lauryn Hill at her best.,"This is one of the most sincere, heartfelt cd's I've listened to. The tunes are great. My favorite song is #16. P.S. Her hidden tracks make for a nice surprise."
2,I'm sorry...but it's overrated.,"My sister bought this CD and said it was great. My mother wanted this CD, so I bought it for her. I heard my mother playing it, but couldn't figure out what was so great about it. Give it another chance, I said. I stole the CD from my brother and listened to it all the way through...I was not impressed. Yes, Lauryn is beautiful and has a beautiful voice, but I for one, do not like her talking through some of the songs. For example in ""Ex-Factor"" which is a great song (I can't get it out of my head), but is that ""yo yo"" necessary in the background? I also like ""To Zion"". ""That Thing"" is nice, but overplayed. This album didn't change my life or anything. I'm glad I borrowed my brother's CD, because I would've felt that I wasted $12 or $13 on an extra copy for myself. Two stars, one each for Ex-Factor and To Zion."
2,This CD is okay.,This CD isn't worth the hype it has been given. It's okay but that's it. Just okay. Her messages are clear but too preachy in my opinion.
2,"Great Album, Talented Strong Women",Lauryn Hill is an extraordinary human being and singer. she is very smart and her music sends a message it kind of teaches you. She makes you listen kind of like a gospel album. It's a spiritual thang. You Go Lauryn!!!
1,1 star,"this cd was definatly composed of a unique style of music. This was definitly not one of my favorites, although i have heard worse."
1,HYPE!,She'll get a truckload load of Grammys but this album will still be weak and flimsy no matter how many she gets.Stiff rhythm as per usual for Hip-Hop and dreary lyrics as usual.At least she'll make that truckload of money her investment manager is looking forward to.
5,The Best CD of the Fall,"When I first bought this CD I knew I loved her first single, but I wasn't so sure if I liked all the tracks, once I started listening I realized the Lauryn Hill had done it again, her music is SWEET its a combonation of ethnic, r&b, rap, gospel and pop music all rolled into one. I think the Fugees should do another CD all together because Pras, Wy Clef and Lauryn Hill are such original and wonderful artists."
5,Master Piece,Every song is incredibly perfect.Be sure that you will active the repeat choice on your cdplayer. You will love it.
4,Es un álbum excepcional,"Al escuchar este CD por primera ocasión me interesó mucho la calidad del mismo pero después de varias canciones me pareció algo poco inovador.Sin embargo,el mérito del álbum se sostiene por la excelente calidad de (no muchas) canciones.En realidad llegarás a pensar que Lauryn Hill es una genio de la música por su capacidad de hacer majestuosas canciones.Para mí es de mis mejores álbums,y vale mucho la pena,porque aunque la calidad del mismo merma un poco en parte del disco,brilla como un quásar en las canciones buenas.Muy recomendable."
5,Lauryn Hill has taken R&B/Hip-Hop back to the right spot,"Lauryn Hill has been able to return to write, record, and produce incredible music with ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill."" Listening to her CD is lovely because it's lyrics are obviously true to the writer's and performer's heart, and they are very relevant to the issues that we face at the end of the millenium. Ms. Hill has also managed to create 16 unique songs, and all of them are done equally well. Let us hope that Ms. Hill has taken the road which other R&B/Hip-Hop Performers will also take, because the music needs a change, and perhaps Lauryn Hill's miseducation is the wake-up much needed."
1,not that good. grossly over-rated.,i mean it wasnt that good sounds not unlike anything we havent heard before. whats the big deal. I guess if your a critic you have to say its good because you have to be politicaly correct. I mean gosh darn she's black and shes singing hip hop.Who would dare go against that right?
1,I would give it no stars if it was available!!,"This album, is so full of phony music, ""Lauren, honey you dissappointed me, I guess I'll stick to the Fugees, rather than on your solo"" This album has no real freshness, it all sounds the same, all the songs are of about the same beat, there is nothing that lift my soul to even want to sing along with her lyrics, the only one is that last song, in the album, which is an oldie just revised to a new version. I really thought she could have done a lot better especially with winning all those grammy's."
1,This album is an ill fated attempt at hip hop honesty.,"Although I am not denying Ms. Hill's obvious talent, it seems as though this album falls short in the Hip Hop genre. This is more of a womens ballad that is clearly not intended for the hard core hip hop fan. I has anticipated some hard core cuts on the joint but was truly disappointed. R&B fans should really like this."
5,I think I've found a new favorite female artist.,"Since she won so many Grammys and everyone says she's so great, I decided to buy this album thinking it would be chock full of crappy reggae numbers, but boy was I wrong! She can sing melodic ballads like ""Nothing Even Matters"" and ""Ex-Factor"" and get jiggy with fast beat tunes like ""Lost Ones,"" ""Doo Wop,"" ""Final Hour,"" and ""Can't Take My Eyes off of you."" buy this album!"
4,Lauryn sings from the soul.,"One thing I love about ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" is that you connect with th artist. You're not just listening, you're feeling. ""Zion"" is my favorite song on there; she pours her heart into that one. A must buy!!"
1,Highly overrated.,"Not just highly overrated, but quite possibly the most overrated album of all time."
1,"I'd give it a ""negative"" score if I could...","This is one of the most overrated and frankly unbearable efforts I've ever heard. Pure trash...I don't see the appeal at all. The songs sound like they were all written in one sitting, with no real thought or care. Bottom line, save your money or spend it elsewhere."
1,Makes me want to throw up,"I truly can't understand WHY people can actually enjoy that stuff. I know that she's a talented singer, but the songs that she sings are really bad! Why can't she sing a melody instead of rapping on and on? She was much better when she was in ""Sister Act2"". My apologies to the people who enjoyed the CD. Thank you."
1,a boring and insipid mess,"I find it somewhat interesting that every review for this album is to the extreme, either one star or five stars with very few in the middle. That should tell you something about mainstream MTV-glorified music"
5,"Miseducation of Lauryn Hill emotional, fun CD","This cd was great. It speaks of growing up, love and life. The words in songs as ""Zion"" make you cry. But there's also a mix of fun songs, like ""Every ghetto, every city"". I recommend this cd to everyone!It moves you, and makes you want to sing along. Lauryn Hill has put beautiful poetry to music. This is a fantastic cd, which will not be a disappointment!!!"
5,You won't listen to anything else...it's THAT good!,"This album is sooooo good! Every track has tremendous base and beat, and each song contains those phat Lauryn Hill lyrics that all just flow and come together to make you feel the song.The CD has 2 bonus tracks at the end which aren't listed on the jacket (nice surprise!). An empowering, soulful, sensual, emotional album that is sure to get you hooked! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do...haven't listened to anything else since I got it!"
5,"She's so real,& the songs are true life stories that inspire","This was a very good CD. Every song was inspiriring and up lifting. Lauryn is a very talented woman. She was very unique with the music, it was like nothing I had ever heard before. the music style was different and she stood out amoung other many artist. I like her insights and views that she expressed in the songs. Mine are basically the same. Lauryn Hill is the BOMB!!! She can flow too. SUPER KRUNK"
1,Tiresome and annoying,"This, like most rap, is cliche drivel. It is ""audio entertainment"" for people who either 1) don't like actual music 2)who don't know better. Very unlikely to stand the test of time. The hype and gushing surrounding this CD is almost unbelievable until you think ""Hey, people liked Milli Vanilli for a while too."" Trendy garbage."
2,wack album,in this album i just like 3 or 4 songs so i just saying that this album don't worth anything
1,SURPRISED!,"i didn't think the album was worth my money at all. plus, i was shocked to find that she's racist against whites, and in my opinion doesn't deserve any respect. she said that she'd rather that ""no white people buy her music."" good enough for me. if she's like that, forget her. she lost my respect. she's obviously very disturbed. i used to like her and support her, but when i heard what she said, to the trash with her."
1,Lauryn Hill is terrible.,"The Fugees were tight.Lauryn Hill by herself... is not.The unbelievably annoying shrill piano tone melody of Doo-Wop (That Thing) will haunt me for the rest of my days! This album cannot possibly stand the test of time, or any other test for that matter. Don't waste your money. (Or bandwidth)"
2,bored to tears,"I am baffled as to what people love about this CD. Lauryn Hill's image is great, but her music is below mediocre. And it's boring. Just because you have a positive message doesn't make you a good musician. There is no funk. The beats suck. That Thing is one of the most irritating songs I've ever heard. Seriously, people... You need to think for yourselves. This album is all hype and no substance. Oh, and comparing her to Marvin Gaye is just a crime. The Fugees are great, but don't be mislead. If you value funk at all, don't buy this CD. I gave it 2 stars for the positive message, but the music deserves a 1."
1,worse album ever,this album is wack the only 2 songs on here i like is1 nothing even matters2 ex factory but other then that i was so diappointed when i bought this album 8 years ago i was salty this is the worse album i ever bought in my life besides whats the 411 by mary j blige
5,The Top of My Music List,"I've been listening to this album since I was about 8 and I've loved it since then. Her lyrics take you to a different place, they make you think. This album is like a journey; through love, hard times, and to success. To me she is like what Kanye West is trying to be now, a MUSICAL GENIUS. She can sing, she can rap, she can write... Lauryn Hill is truly an inspiration to young artists. Some of my favorites on this album are ""Lost Ones"", ""Ex-Factor"", ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"", ""Superstar"", ""Final Hour"", ""I Used To Love Him"" with MJB, ""Forgive Them Father"", ""Every Ghetto Every City"", ""Nothing Even Matters"" with D'Angelo, and ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"". I recommend this album for ANYONE who is a fan of good music. BKLYNBABYLON signing off..."
5,Amazing!,"Lauryn Hill does a lot of different things on this album...and she does them all well! You have her singing in a classic R&B style on some songs to going hardcore rap on other songs. Then you have the different musical styles...Motown, rap, soul, R&B, and even a track featuring Santana. Worth checking out, worth buying, and definitely worth the hype!"
5,this was an inredible album,she really outdid herself with this wonderul album.her voice is strong and breathtaking. each song was incredible and full of emotion. my heart melted with each loving word sung about her son zion. i liked her when she was with the fugees. amazed by her in sister act 2 and blown away by her with this album.
4,A great album!,"I wasn't that big of a fan of the Fugees, but this I really like. Now I know it's not the most original or most well done album I ever listend to. But some of the songs (like ex-factor) just makes me wanna listen to it forever. I don't know why everyone keeps bugging so much about originality, if someone makes a great album with great songs, let it just rest at that!? The miseducation of Lauryn Hill is definitly a very good album, and I recomend it to anyone!"
5,Fantastic,"Lauryn Hill is one person who can actually sing, and not only that, she's a brilliant rapper, song writer (and producer - after all, she did produce the album) All the songs are wonderfull and she really is brimming with talent. I especially like 'To Zion' (about her son), it's much better than that Will Smith song about his kid (no offence to Will Smith fans but all his songs sound exactly the same whether he's singing about MIB, his son, Miami or whatever)"
5,"positive, spiritual,inspisartional","this album has the best album yet from any artist. lauryn has a strong sense of spirituality and it shows in her msic. she doesn't put anyone down in her lyrics she just educates them, and she doesn't look down on them neither because her album is about her experiences in life. it's about all the things school didn't teach her that why it's called the miseducation of lauryn hill. racist? i think not! who ever wrote the bad review on her calling her a racist you definately need to get your facts straight before you try and call some one a racist. she is an inspiration to the new hip hop generation and has the support of all artists black or white. don't playa hate congradulate. go lauryn! i commend you. i applaude you, i bow down to you."
5,Lauryn Hill is the best,The songs are great I love them all. My favorite is the song The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. It is great. The whole CD is great.
5,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,"For far too long we've awaited the debut of Mama Zion, Ms. L-Boogie herself, and what a wonderful reward patience brings, this album is superb. She has expertly blended all the elements of a true hip-hop album to create the female rap album creme de la creme. From beginning to end, it's non-stop ear appetizing. I flipped when I heard the heart wrenching and soul identifying song ""Miseducation of L.Hill"" or the vibrating reggae song ""Forgive Them Father"". Lauryn wonderfully combines poetry, dope beats and (like 2Pac her Gemini male twin R.I.P.), music we can identify with from the heart. Anyone can feel this album deeply from the children to the elders of our community, ThanQ Ms. Hill, We love you!"
5,"""best one Ive heard in a long time!""","This cd by Lauryn Hill is one of the best written cds that will ever be written.The reason I loved this cd is that it got me off of listing to hard rock to listening to more smooth.....mellodic music. When you listen to this cd more and more you will get more out of it and find out the meaning inside the song. Some of my favorite songs on hear are.... Doo Wop That Thing, I used to love him, and Everything is Everything. But the most mellodic and meaningful song in this album is Forgive them Father. Buy it and listen to it. You'll understand what Im talking about."
5,The best ..,"I cant really say enough about this album. Its a masterpiece, a beautiful poetically written gospel. I totally understand what Lauryn Hill is preaching and agree with every word. Its incredible how one person can write and sing all of these resonating songs in such a flawless way. I was born in the 90s and this was what I listening to as a young girl and now I listen to it being much older makes me appreciate it more. If you dont know who Lauryn Hill is, buy this album and listen to it thoroughly. You will have such an appreciation for female singers and rap artists. I listen to this till this day so her work is definitely always relevant :]"
1,lastest craze,"Can we say pet rock? Oh also, if the album is so damn good, how come the singles are NOT being played all over the radio? TOTAL HYPE...Lets look back in 2 years and you will say ""who""?"
1,I've Had Enough,"I'd just like to say that every track on this CD is wack, except for ""Lost Ones"". Lauryn Hill trying to sing makes me sick. She's a much better rapper. That's all I gotta say."
1,Don't see what the big deal is,Popular music must be in a pretty sad state if people rave so much about this thing.
5,Janet watch your back: Miss Hill is in town,"Lauryn Hill can't miss. Naturally beautiful, sings AND raps, writes, directs AND produces...she is the complete package and proves it on this cd! You want to listen to it for the sheer beauty and strength of it, you have to listen to it for the lessons she teaches. We waited a long time for baby girl to do it on her own and it is more than worth it."
5,Lauryn Hill's new album is truly inspiring.,"Lauryn Hill has done an excellent job with her first solo effort. I bought the CD the day it was released and have listened to it practically everyday since then. I've heard other people say that the CD is too ""preachy"". I couldn't disagree more. It's refreshing to hear a musician that takes her talent seriously and tries to express positivity."
5,Should be added to your music collection ASAP,"This album is fantastic. It has everything. She brings every emotion a woman has ever had to the forefront. ""TO Zion"" is quite possibly the strongest song on the album. She brought the pain, agony, and delight every woman has when she is confronted with an unplanned pregnancy. But she handles it with style and grace. Lauryn will, in time, take her place amongst the REAL divas in the music biz (Chaka, Aretha, Patti, Gladys, and Dionne. Can't wait to hear more from her in the future."
2,it's okay but no classic,"she is a good artist for these times but she is overrated and stated.a few good songs but the music sounds all the same.it ain't no thriller,songs in the key of life,what's going on,sparkle,superfly.to be more blunt&honest it's not as good as wycliff's disc.he tried to something different at least.l-hill to me is a better producer than artist."
2,"I Love Lauryn,But this Album is Overrated!","I love Lauryn Hill, really I do. I especially loved her song, ""The Sweetest Thing"" on the Love Jones soundtrack, so when I heard all the hype about her new album, I wasn't surprised. She has a powerful voice.....BUT this album is not for her. She only has, like two good songs (Ex-factor and Mahogany-the hidden track) but even those songs are just GOOD not GREAT. This album is highly overrated and was a huge disappointment. How she has won all those awards with this album is a pure mystery to me. Her voice is amazing, but the songs on this album just were not for her. I am so sorry I bought this and it pains me so much to remember that I didn't buy it on sale! Don't believe the hype, this album is not all that. Period."
1,A damn shame.,"I don't know why this gets all that attention. The CD, to be quite honest, didn't do anything for me. The only song that was that good was the Roberta Flack wannabe ""Ex-Factor"". I think Lauryn tries too hard to sound like Roberta. I mean, this album and Lauryn herself got nominees that didn't apply to her. She's nominated for best rap solo on ""Lost Ones"", which was never released as a single. If they wanna play like that, why didn't they ever nominate the Dogg Pound's ""Smooth"", which was a masterful performance."
1,My ignorance,"I bought this cd because of the multiple Grammy nominations. I suppose my ignorance is that I don't know the meaning of ""hip-hop"". It is all rap! I hated it."
5,THIS CD IS THE BEST OF 1998/1999 AND THE NEW MILLENIUM,"LAURYN HILL IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL...........SHE IS SMART, BEAUTIFUL, TALENTED AND A WONDERFUL SINGER.......ALL COMBINATIONS MANY PEOPLE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY LACKS....HER CD SHOULD SET NEW STANDARDS IN TODAYS MUSIC.....UNLIKE MANY ARTISTS WHO FEEL THE NEED TO USE SWEAR WORDS OFTEN, SHE USED IT ONCES (""I PUT A MUTHAFUCKA IN IT SO YOU IGNORANT NIGGAS HEAR ME"")....WHICH ITSELF WAS A POWERFUL STATEMENT......ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK...U R TRULY THE BOMB......"
3,She just gets there,"I've been listening to this release for some time now trying to understand the hype and reason for all the rave reviews and accolades. I couldn't see it , hard as I tried. However with it fading away, I started to appreciate it. She was individual in style and approach - deserves applause for that. The downside is the absence of the ' rap ' in trying to cover all the bases at once.She inspired the individuality that we have sinse seen from the likes of Macy since. However we would like to see some hip-hop next time around."
1,I laughed hard when I heard about her Medusa snake-hairstyle,Bah! not worth much. hip-hop you say? Maybe Bull-hop is more applicable here. get a clue about real rap artists miss Medusa!
3,Why did this cd win so many grammy awards last year?,"I know that Lauryn is a good rapper and some of the songs are cool, but overall it is kinda boring and just blah. I liked Doo Woop (That Thing). To Zion was a outstanding song and I like how Carlos Santana did the guitar for the song. It was ok. Not earth shattering like Third Eye Blind's ""Blue"""
3,I DONT KNOW WHAT ALL THE HYPE IS ABOUT,"OK. I DONT HATE LAURYN HILL. SHE MADE ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME(NOT THIS ONE, THE SCORE as a member of the fugees) EVERYONE SAYS THAT THIS ALBUM IS SOOOOOO GOOD, BUT THE SONGS WERE JUST WEAK TO ME. ESPECIALLY THE SONG WITH D'ANGELO(ONE OF MY FAVORITE ARTISTS) ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT IF YOU LIKE THIS, GOOD FOR YOU. I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT. IF YOU CAN REALLY APPRECIATE SOMEONES MUSIC, IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT I SAY IN MY REVIEW OR WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS TO YOU. THIS REVIEW IS MY PERSONAL OPINION AND EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON EVERYTHING. THIS WAS NOT MEANT FOR ME TO TELL YOU TO NOT BUY THE ALBUM. IT WAS MEANT FOR ME TO GET MY OPINION ACROSS."
5,Excellent! Ms. Hill outdid herself this time.,"I thought the music was wonderful. I liked when Ms. Hill sang with the Fugees, and think Ms. Hill is a master of rhythm and rhyme. ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" is a CD I can listen to over and over again."
5,This cd is Phenomenal,THIS CD BREAKS ALL KINDS OF BARRIERS. MS. HILL IS TOTALLY LEGIT. THIS CD SHOWS HER ABILITY TO APPEAL TO ALL KINDS OF AUDIENCES. lAURYN HILL HAS EVERYTHING IT TAKES TO BE ONE THE ARTISTS WHO STAY AROUND FOR YEARS. TO MS. HILL: THANK YOU FOR THE MOST REAL CD I HAVE HEARD OUTSIDE OF GOSPEL MUSIC IN YEARS.
5,This album deserved every Grammy it won and so much more,"This cd is excellent. Every song has its own unique sound and you can't quite pinpoint her style, which makes me love it all the more. I listen to this cd any time I can and enjoy it every single time. My ratings of each song- Lost Ones - **** (out of five) Ex - Factor - **** - I love how it doesn't have the traditional chorus. To Zion - ***** - This song to her son is so sweet. Doo-Wop (That Thing) - ***** - Hip-hop in all of it's glory. Superstar - *** Final Hour - ***** - Edgy, who do you think you are attitude. When It Hurts So Bad - *** I Used to Love Him - **** - It's a great duet between Mary J. Blige and Lauryn. Forgive Them Father - *** Every Ghetto, Every City - ***** - MAkes you want to dance! Nothing Even Matters - **** - Another great duet. Everything is Everything - **** The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill - **** And the bonus tracks are good too. You go, girl!"
5,the most inner reaching album of the hip hop era,I often felt as if this were my subconcious speaking while Lauryn's beautiful voice played in the backround. She was killing me softly with the similarities to my life. Ms. Hill is trully triumphant here.
5,Lauren Hill is an inspirational delight!,"The Miseducation of Lauren Hill is an amazing album that transends the mundane music of today resulting in sounds that appeal to the soul. She delivers a message that inspires people regardless of race, age, or creed. This album is an amazing thing to own."
5,timeless,"after a decade it's still one of my favorites. i love every track on here, especially zion. i should probably buy a new one, since the one i have is scratched up, but it still plays pretty good. she really taught the lessons of being in love, being a woman and a mother."
5,Doesn't take much to describe this album,"Even after a decade this album still sounds sooo much better than most anything else out right now. I don't think I'll ever get tired of hearing this album over and over. I was introduced to it as a middle school kid, I rediscovered it a few months ago and just can't believe how fresh and deep it still sounds."
5,It's a classic!,"I know everyone is probably sick of her voice but this album is good. I had it for a while now and even though I have to admit I've listened to it so many times that I'm ""done"" with it it was good until the radio played it out."
2,"It's okay, but...","After all the Press and the 5 times Grammy winning, I must say that This CD only is a ornament for my CD-Collection. It doesn't grow on me at all! There are a few nice songs on it, but that's all! All the Rest I skip away! Sorry, but I don't think to buy something more from her."
1,Truly miseducated,"I hope this artist gets beyond simple expression and learns to create music.We shouldn't suffer for her ""art."""
2,laurin hill takes a second seat to Celine Dion,"Celine Dion has put out the most memorable and sold CD of the 90's, states Billboard magazine but laurin hill should try to learn from superiors like Celine when it comes to making a Cd. i don't like hip hop and this didn't do any better. i recommend to buy Celine cd instead."
5,As brilliant and multi-faceted as sisters everywhere....,"You don't have to be anything but a human with ears to feel the fire of Lauryn Hill. ""Lost Ones"" was incredible, as was ""Ex-Factor,"" ""Superstar"", and ""...Zion"": that's an athem for mothers everywhere. And the title track? Perfection!!! The interludes worked my last nerve (can you say ""fast forward""???), and I don't care for ""The Final Hour"" or ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"", but otherwise, a classic. Treat yourself to one of the best releases of the year. Keep flowing Miss Hill: can't wait to see you in March!!!"
5,shes just too good to be true!,"I LOVED THIS CD.listening to Lauryns words were almost as thought one could feel that she was heavy with birth, and the outcome was a masterful play of words interwoven with love and a soul-filled voice. she is as much a prodigy as she is a beauty, and a mother.i loved it."
3,It was okay...,"It was a good CD but what is this about she would rather no one bought her music than to have one white person buy her CD. I bet that the majority of people who bought this CD where young, white, suburban, females."
4,she remembers who gave her the talent to do so well,i think in any kind of music her voice is so wonderful to listen to it wouldnt matter if the tunes were ugly or not.
4,"Good, but could use a little more R&B","I got this cd from my mom who had heard it was really good, normally I'm not into this kind of musicbut I really liked it. My favorite song on it is ""To Zion"" But I wish it had a little more R&B music in it."
2,Something was bugging me about this CD.,"I couldn't figure out what. But then it came to me. She is copying Bob Marley. I see it clearly now: the lyrics, music, even the hair style. Then I realized she named a son zion. The sentiments of the Rastafarian people of Jamaica copied down to the ""T"". Maybe she can fool middle America, but the people who listen to ""World Music"" know better. We've been exposed to this music years before. I gave her 2 stars for re-packaging and marketing the music to the general public of America who maybe haven't heard ""world music"" before."
5,she's amazing,this album is amazing there is a reason why it won so many awards. she will be in Stockholm for the jazz fest this summer!
4,Miseducation indeed,"This CD never gets old. Lauryn was in rare form and seemingly at the peak of her creativity. I don't know what happened but I'm waiting for the genius of songwriting ability to return. Though I've never thought much of her as ""Live"" performer, she definitely is the bomb in the studio. Great CD. Highly recommend."
4,"this was an ""ok"" album",this album was ok after listening to it for some time its not that great. i do appreciate that she adds some gospel feel to it. and i think she has a beautiful voice but i like her rapping better. my advice is borrow this and see if ya like it then buy it.
3,Good album.,"It's everything I expect from a debut album; nice new music but lacks almost everything else. What I have to give credit for in this album is the lyrics, I just love them. From Lauryn herself, (on ""Lost Ones,"" probably the best track) she raps: ""I know you don't wanna hear my opinion/ But there comes a time when you must choose one..."" If you like rap or hip-hop, this is a must have."
5,I love all of lauryn's songs they are really great .,"Ilove all of lauryn's songs their absolutely great.she helps me get in touch with my inner soul.Ilove her music and hers is the best ever in century, she's truly the""Diva of the millenium""I especially love her song ""forgive them father"" it reflects on a part of my life that I was never able to come to terms with. I forgot that the only way to wipe away any emotional pain is to pray about it and leave up to jesus christ himself. I LOVE YOU LAURYN HILL, your message will live on and on even after life it self you go girl may the good lord keep you on your long journey onward. ""LAURYN HILL THE DIVA OF THE MILLENIUM"""
5,She speaks what she fills. She's real,"When I listen to this CD I was able to understand what kind of point she was trying to make. Lauren like everyone else, is only human for thoes who did not like her CD but for the ones that did she is perfect!!!"
5,A Classic Album,"Lauryn Hill was so far ahead of her time when this most popular, genre mixed Cd was released. It was a ""must"" have then and now required to have a complete Cd library."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzz......,"No, this CD is not as bad as one-star. But someone needs to balance all the 5-star reviews...Face it, any CD that USA Today and People magazine rave about has to be pretty lame. I tried to like this CD, but it's a bunch of bland, faceless soul singing combined with a small helping of very average rap.It's a plus that folks are looking for women rappers, and willing to support them. But Lauren Hill is vastly overrated.Wanna hear the real thing? Check out The Coup. Good rapping, great lyrics."
2,This CD does not reflect Lauryn's talent,"I am the first to admit that Lauryn Hill has a very beautiful voice, but she did not show it on this CD. None of the songs caught my attention except ""Can't take my eyes off you."" That was the only song that truly captured the beauty of Lauryn's voice. In my opinion, Lauryn should stay away from the rap and stick to more ballads."
2,Nuttin' new here,"Although you could never say that this album is a complete wash, it never even got close to tickling my mind, catching me off guard with a fresh, unexpected turn of melody or riddim or sound splash. It ended up sounding way too cliche...and pardon the paraphrase...but...""Everything she dropped was so tired."""
2,A good blen of folk/country with hip-hop.,"Lauryn Hill, former member of the Fugees (which brought out such great unoriginal remakes such as ""Kill Me Softly"", which was actually a remake of an unknown band known as Pearl, hailing from the Reichstag in Germany (a political band!) with Perry Farrell on bass. Her new single ""That Thing, That Thing, That Things,"" surprisingly has sexual overtones. What thing could that be? But the album is excellent, bringing hip-hop into mainstream pop. Hip-Hop is finally becoming widely known and emerging into the mainstream. As a result we will benefit from more pop/mainstream albums from Lauryn Hill and pop/mainstream albums from other Hip-Hop artists. Good Going Lauryn Hill! Hip-Hop is now accepted and everyone will listen to it! FIVE BIG STARS!"
5,"THE BEST R&B ALBUM SINCE ""SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE""",Lauryn Hill tells it how it is. This is an album with honest lyrics that make sense. Hip-hop is changed forever! Other great albums of '98: Madonna RAY OF LIGHT & Lucinda Williams CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD
5,DA BOMB,"Lauren Hill is on her way. Being the key member of the Fugees she has proven that all three are very successful and talented. This CD shows all sides of Lauren's gifts. Being a true MC and a great singer, Lauren proves she is equally as good at both of her crafts, which is just spectacular. Bomb tracks are: Lost Ones, Doo Wop (That Thing), Every Ghetto, Every City, To Zion, and both hidden tracks."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST,"I am the best Lauryn Hill fan out there. Her smooth rhythymic tones are hot and out of this world. I tell you, this is the best yet. A classical hit of the late 90's."
3,I like it but.....,"I think Lauryn Hill's voice is beautiful. I wish there were more R & B songs, and less rap. And, I also don't like all the talking after almost every track. But, I love Can't Take My Eyes Off You. She did a great job covering that song! I also like That Thing, and When It Hurts So Bad."
2,"I hate to say it, but...","This is one overatted album! The lyrcial content is nice. Very pleasent. A real upper, but nothing new or innovative. To say that she put so much of her soul into it is a joke! Most of the time it's just stuff like Superstar where Lauryn bitches about how fly she thinks it is. That's no soul. That's arrogance! Some tracks almost make it. I do think of Forgive Them Father quite often. I alos like her vocals but they are so constrained by lay-overs like in Ex-Factor. She should only be singing one line at a time. It sounds more natural. There is a few good bouncy doo-wop songs, but that's about all this album offers. It is no classic and will not be remembered as fondly 10 years from now as it is today. Peechy album, but there is quite a few others I would take to a desert island. I give it 2 and 1/2 stars."
5,This CD is simply excellent,When every I suggest to someone to buy this cd my primary reason for suggesting the cd is because it is an expression of meaning. I feel that Lauryn is a very deep individual and gives much thought and purpose to her songs...........I simply love it!
4,(:D) ....it was ok for me,I liked it the cowboy just did it for me it was sad at some points but it was a good watch for me..
4,The Guide to Making Your Trolls Even Bigger Characters,"Didn't White Wolf's short description in the Changeling rule book tell you enough about those big oafs that call themselves trolls? If you want to fill out your character so she isn't just a big, clumsy, not-so-bright, oaf, this Kithbook is a must. With new troll only merits/flaws and weapons and treasure, you'll have the tools to make your troll more realistic and unique. Included is a fairly detailed outline of Troll history since before the Shattering along with what the Trolls really think of the other kiths from both a Seelie and Unseelie perspective. With splendid artwork, a definite must buy for the serious Changeling participant. The only criticism is that the book is a bit on the thin side, but nevertheless is packed with information."
1,Shipped Substitute Item,Did not ship the style folder that I ordered. Folders were not the same quality and had a white sticker on the back covering something. They enclosed a letter detailing why they shipped an inferior product. Very disappointed.
4,Pocket Portfolios,"These two pocket portfolios are some of the best I have seen. I was getting them at Staples, but these are so much better!"
5,What a twisted character!,I had to give this a 5 star review because Sedaris makes me laugh out loud. Everyone will think you're a nut while you're reading this because you will be unable to stifle your snickers. His character is so twisted that I can't believe he's talking about himself! I refuse to swallow that those stories are even half-way true. Not all of the stories are funny but there are plenty of laughs in this book. I'll read anything he wants to write!
4,Classic but relatively unknown Bing Christmas music,"I found this album (under a different title, but the songs are the same) while searching through the used music section of a local store, and by golly I had been looking for most of these songs most of my life. I'd hear snippets of them here and there but I could never find where the collection was. Der Bingle's ""Christmas Album"" (or as my cover states, ""A Christmas Toast from Bing"") is a welcome addition to any household that relishes the Holiday Nostalgia from the 40's and 50's."
3,Just OK,I think the item would be better if the bottom was tapered. The rectangular shape is too bulky and unnecessary. Otherwise the nylon material seems durable and the velcro scissor latch is good. I would get the horizontal version since the vertical one just gets in the way.
3,Not what it says,"The description says that this holster accommodates up to 2.5"" belts. This isn't the case. My belt measures 2"", and the holster doesn't even close around it. This is a good product, but make sure your belt is 1.5"" or less."
4,Great,"This is a very good video - a great adaption of the book (although some bits were left out, that's understandable) and with good acting all round. I also agree that Daniel Radcliffe did a much better job here than in Harry Potter - I think it was this that gave him that ""magical quality"" people mention. Costumes and settings were brilliant."
4,"The first half great, second half...","I saw this movie after seeing Daniel Radcliffe in all 4 Harry Potter movies and I must confess that his acting touched me more here than in any of his other roles. I love Daniel Radcliffe but I wonder what happens to boys as they grow up? Do they find that they have to hide their feelings as they get older? This is what struck me in his more grown up films. All I have to say is for Dan to look at this and tap into what made his performance so excellent here. Please learn to cry again on film.Maggie Smith is memorable as usual and Bob Hoskins is a delight. I must say that the second half of the movie is a bit of a snooze. The portrayal of the older David Copperfield is not nearly as interesting. Other than this I highly recommend it especially if you are a Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter or Dickens lover."
3,The Book is Better,"Usually I know I'm going to like anything by BBC before I even see it. But I was a bit leery about their version of David Copperfield because the book is so long and they couldn't possibly fit everything into a movie.I'm not happy with what they took out. David's best friend from school, Tommy Traddles, isn't even mentioned. The acting, scenery, costumes, music, etc...is all nice. But I came away feeling like something was missing from this vibrant story about a boy growing up.Although, I must add I still cried about the last part with Agnes.Overall, this film was well done but not fulfilling. Not a classic rewatchable movie in my opinion. If you have time just read the book (it's 500+ pages though)."
4,"""David Copperfield"" - Pretty good","The movie was overall pretty good. The story in the movie stayed close to the book, with the exception that several characters such as Dr. Strong, Thomas Traddle were eleminated from teh story. Which I thought was a bit odd, because these characters were great to the story. It is argued that David Copperfield himself is rather a dull character with no strong personality and that what makes Dicken's book wonderful are the David's surrounding characters. This argument was well presented in the movie because the actor who played adult David Copperfield had a relatively dull camera time than rest of the roles. He didn't seem to have much freedom to express any of his emotions in front of the camera. My favorite character is David's aunt Betsy Trotwood, both in the book and in the movie. The actress was very good.I recommend this movie to everyone who likes the book.Purple_Garden"
5,Dickens - Great Prose,"Dickens has become my favorite author of all time. His novels are still relevant to this day - 150 years or so after they were written. It takes a bit of time to settle into the formal style of 19th century British writers, but once you get into the flow, the stories are great, the characters come alive in sparkling clarity, and not one plot element is left hanging. Long reads? Yes, definitely, but well worth the time and effort. I would wager that you will be sorry to see the book end if you persevere. Why were these books such drudgery to read when assigned in school? Maybe it takes some years in the world to appreciate what Dickens left for us."
5,David Copperfield,"Masterpiece Theater does it again! This is the debut of ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe. Ironically enough, quite a few of the cast members of this PBS miniseries have performed together, especially cast members from ""Harry Potter."" This is a perfect film...no flaws at all. Comparable to the PBS miniseries,""Moll Flanders."""
5,A great version of a great classic!,I saw this and became very aware of why David Copperfield has become such a classic. The production of this PBS version rivals any period movie made with Hollywood money. You'll really get involved in the lives of the characters.
3,re-makes,"PBS should not get into making re-makes of fine productions (if I'm not mistaken, previously done on Masterpiece Theater). While a reasonably good movie, not nearly as good as the one a couple of years ago, which I would like to purchase. Much was left out which made the Dickens story so very complex. I guess the ""dumbing down of modern times"" continues, but pick on modern stories, then, rather than make people think this was the story that Dickens wrote. But -- still -- not nearly as bad as the recent ""Woman in White"" remake."
4,Excellent adaption of the Dickens classic!,"I happen to be a huge period piece buff, and David Copperfield is so rich with characters. Perfect for showing off the acting chops~and the acting in this version is top notch. Uriah Heep is one of the smarmiest characters in literature and watching his character in this adaption made my flesh crawl. Perfect!"
3,TLG,"This movie was exellant as far as I could tell. However I am extremlyhard of hearing and this DVD was advertised to have ""closed caption""as did the back cover say the movie was ""closed caption"".Ofcourse it was not ""closed caption"" nor did it have sub titles.I do not blame Amazon for this as they had no way of telling.However I dofault whoever makes these dvd's for BBC. BBC needs to be aware thatat least this dvd was not as it should have been. I did however watchthe movie with hearing aids in, but could still understand very littleof what they were saying."
1,Terrible!,"I love to watch period films based on classical novels and I am a huge fan of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. The BBC has done just a wonderful job of reproducing many of these works in recent years, but I thought I would give this one a try since it was at a discounted rate on Amazon. It was just plain unengaging. The characters were difficult to relate to with the exception of the young David Copperfield, his mother, and Piggoty. I found the whole thing to be more of a depressing adaptation instead of the triumphal tale of overcoming a difficult past. I now have buyer's remorse. :/ If at all possible, please watch the movie by renting or watching snippets on youtube before buying."
