3,"Start off with This Kyuss Album, then.....","Start off with This Kyuss Album, then go to the others, because if you like this one, you will really enjoy the other albums so much more. I usually try to encourage new listeners to pick up the weakest effort (which would be this one) from a band that they arent familer with, because if you can dig an album that is only average, then you will really appricate the band more. Kyuss is a must for ""Stoner"" metal and rock fans, and even though ""and the circus left town"" is only slighty above average (OK, I will give it 3 1/2 Stars) the other albums are much stronger..ENJOY"
4,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic thermos, especially considering the price! It keeps drinks warm for a reasonably long time, and is dishwasher safe. And, unlike some termoses (thermoses? thermosi? nevermind) that I've used in the past, this one doesn't fall apart after two runs through the dishwasher, or let liquid seep into the insulation so that after two weeks you start getting a vaguely disturbing smell that you can't identify or clean out. I prefer the silver one, because I thinks it's a ""sleeker"" look, but that's just a matter of preference."
4,Would be AWESOME if it were dishwasher-safe,"I love this mug. I bought this one and the blue one on a whim and am pleased with the look, heft, and capacity of both. I love that it fits decently in my car's cupholders, which are under the dash, and stay very leak-proof. My only regret is that they are not dishwasher safe, but otherwise they are fantastic. If you're on the edge of buying one of Copco's mugs, go for it."
5,Wonderful!,"This CD is a marvelous showcase for this extremely gifted performer. It is a collection you will listen to again and again. It spotlights the ""Iceman's"" early hits giving you rare gems with the Impressions as well as some of his later masters. Listen to one of the truly great yet under appreciated singers of our time."
3,Maybe Not The Best of JB,"Although I didn't think it was the best of Jerry Butler, I thoroughly enjoyed most of the 18 tracks included. I'm primarily interested in most of his cuts prior to 1965 (the year I graduated from high school) and it's obvious I will have to get others to have a complete collection. However, if you are a fan of JB, I think you will enjoy this CD although I consider it to be incomplete."
5,Simple,"Great tool for cleaning/refilling, I use it on my 10 gal tank and it working great, also used it on my beta tank. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy in tank maintenance."
3,Not as good as Python,"I've had a python for 5 years and was stupid last time I put it away and didn't make sure all the water was out of it and behold, mold! I was looking for something fast on here (since I have prime) and not overly expensive. Lee's was always at the pet store so figured I'd try it. It doesn't have the vacuum power I'm used to, took a half hour to do my 29 gal. Even then I had to refill the tank to finish cleaning the gravel. Not impressed, but it worked just took too long for my taste. Plus side is no leaks"
4,"Very good, especially for the price!","I've been in and around the painting business for more than a few years but hadn't used an HVLP sprayer for over 20 years. This sprayer is very good for the price, especially for the smaller jobs and more so with oil based and varnish type finishes. Clean-up is much, much quicker and economical without all the line to clean as with a typical airless. Checking the flow rate and good filtering practices ARE a must, but anyone who has done any spray painting will find this machine easy and (again!) economical to work with. I chose to give it only 4 stars because of some small faults I found: I think it should have a 3-prong electrical plug (just an extra safety feature) and the air supply hose could be just a little more substantial AND longer."
1,One time use product,"Should have paid attention to the reviews about leaking. After one use it leaked like made where the tip goes in.Sprays fine but not any good if it dripping on to the area.All plastic so I figured I did not tighten enough. Went to use again and when I tightened the tool they give you broke. So take apart get the pieces out, put the needle back and tighten and the piece that it screws into breaks out of the gun. This is a piece all right."
4,"Good product, good value.","I read the reviews of several HVLP sprayers before I decided to take a chance on this one. I am entirely satisfied.Good packaging, reasonably good design (the cord does suck, but oh well.) well written instruction manual. The gun is very easy to clean and the accessory cleaning kit is worth having. Overall, a well executed product. Way to go, Earlex.I did take the advice of several reviewers on the amount of Floetrol to use when thinning paint. I am getting good results using 3 parts paint, 1 part floetrol. I can't wait to spray some clear finishes."
3,Earlex 3000 hvlp,It sprays well with latex and poly. I am happy with the finish. It is an inexpensive tool and therefore has limitations. The hose and cord are short and everything except the needle is plastic. But- it sprays good!
3,decent gun,"Earlex advertises this HVLP sprayer saying it will spray all paints and clear finishes. It sprays lacquer with good results, it sprays Waterlox great. It sprays oil based polyurethane okay but has a hard time with water based polyurethane. It will not spray paint. I thinned alkali paints to the point of ridiculous and still this sprayer would not spray without spatter. Don't even think about using it for latex based paint. If you are spraying most clear finishes, this gun might work for you. I use it exclusively for spraying Waterlox which it excels at."
1,JUNK,"SLOW TO HEAT UP, 1.5 HOURS TO GO FROM 65 F TO 160 F. ADJUSTMET BUTTON FELL OUT OF HOLE AND IS GONE. JUNK AFTER USE OF 6 TIMES OF USE."
1,Call Me - Sample remix version is NOT the downloaded version!,"Hey! I purchased this twice thinking that this was a glitch. ""Call Me"" is not the song that I downloaded from the Sampladelic album. I love the few-second sample that is provided, but the download version is the original song from the original album! Don't think I'll get my two bucks back, but I won't be buying any music from Amazon. I'm sticking back to iTunes."
3,"Many a ""Good Beat"".","It's your basic remix album, just good. I'm gonna guess casual fans can pass on this, and go for the hits disc. However, true fans of Deee-lite, or fans of electronica/dance music, may expierience a ""Mind Melt"" upon listening. None of the originals are really improved on, they're just much different. Some are nearly unrecognizable, some are slowed down or sped up quite a bit. This is surely full of good beats though, good samples, and it's a good 69 minutes long. If you're forever waiting on that Lady Miss Kier solo album, you know you need to pick this up."
2,"Not bad, but not too great either...","I was pretty excited when this hit the shelves, but it was a real disappointment. The musical artistry itself wasn't too bad, but the grooves were nowhere near as grovy and electrifying as the group's earlier material. This could have something to do with the fact that most of the album wasn't actually remixed by members of Deee Lite. I recommend their earlier remix singles, if you can get your hands on them."
3,I recomend it for advanced readers,It's a well edited and wonderful source of information but it's for advanced readers. I don't use it for my translation classes.
4,1974 Album Mixes Blues/Soft Rock/Reggae.,"The fantastic cover design sets the tone for an interesting album which covers several styles with good quality music.Bob Marley's I Shot The Sheriff introduced many mainstream listerners to reggae, but the best by far is Let It Grow, a powerfully understated song.I also recommend the follow up One In Every Crowd from 1975."
3,And GOD created something else at 461 Ocean Boulevard,"In the 60's, Eric Clapton was GOD, but after that he became addicted and than (only) human. His '461 Ocean Boulevard', recorded in Florida, was a shock to many old believers, but his laid back approach also brought him a new and broader audience. It's a fine album, with some strong emotional songs like 'Please be with me' and 'Let it grow', and also some more straightforward stuff, pleasing, but not too special."
3,My favorite song is GONE,"Just got this one in the mail. Does anybody know who decided to replace ""Better Make it Through Today"" (song 2, side one on the lp version) with ""Give Me Strength"" on the CD? Couldn't both have been included on a 40 minute CD? The MFSL version does include both. For me it lessons a great album. The remastering sounds pretty good and it still was a major comeback album for Clapton. The rest of the material is a beginning to Clapton's more vocal focused 80's output, but there is still an urgency Clapton's playing here that makes it more than worthwhile. OK, I give it 4 stars if both of the previously mentioned songs were included, and 2.5 with ""Better make it Through... oddly deleted."
4,For serious Clapton fans only,"Worthwhile listen for the serious Clapton fan and colector only. This is not Clapton at his best, but does capture a tentative, unsure artist on his comeback tour. Useful to contrast his playing on this tour with the 1975 tour on which he was more out in front and confident in his abilities."
1,An Audio Mix Disaster,"Yes, everything the reviews say about the regular CD is correct. This is one of Eric's premier works, but do yourself a favor and purchase the regular compact disk. After purchasing this DTS release, I was horrified to listen to the lead guitar comming out of the right rear speaker on several cuts. I do not rememeber who mixed this (I sent it back for a refund), but they should have been given the janitorial tasks at the company, not at the mixing board. Maybe it was a mistake."
3,Middle Of The Road,"A quiet tone exists on this recording. Let It Grow is the standout song on this recording and a few others have ear catching moments as well. However, the lack of enough rock n roll tunes here make this an average recording when compared to Eric's work as a whole."
5,great album,461 Ocean Boulevard contains some of the most optimistic and faithful songs Eric Clapton has ever written. The lyrics really boost people's faith in what they want to accomplish. The songs are just simply beautiful and captivating.
4,Rewarding CD.,"""Uninspired"" Clapton is still way ahead of inspired competition.A very good insight into creative process. Plenty of decent playing."
3,Uneven Pavement,"What were we thinking back then? This was a top album at the time of its release in 1974, aided by a couple of hit singles -- and, apparently, Clapton's guitar-hero halo, which prevented us from taking a good listen.The recording doesn't age well. It's largely uninspired, languid 70's rock. Great cover songs (Motherless Children, Willie and the Hand Jive, I Shot the Sheriff) are run through the de-flavorizer. Clapton's singing sounds like he's been told to keep it down and his playing shares a ""don't wake the neighbors"" restraint. Where's the fire? NOT on this album.The best moments are the back-to-back ballads, Please be With Me & Let it Grow. Dated and sentimental, perhaps, but with great changes and gorgeous arrangements.Clapton may be God, but even God rested on the 7th day. And now we know at what address."
3,Should have toned down the insessant beats,I guess Moby's got a rep to live up to but this nice ambient disc is flawed I think from the driving beats he deemed necessary and that are so much in the fore of the soundscapes here. Tone them down and concentrate a little more on everything else nice that is going on and I would likely give this 5 stars. A shame but I suppose Moby fans looking to relax a little will like it.
3,a set of tv sketches does not a book make,"my wife and i each read this book in 1 evening (it's short, folks), and both had the same impression: a series of hit-and-miss sketches somewhat appropriate for a SNL-type setting, but not really worth it as a book."
2,"I get it, Jon. I get it!","This book has its moments, but Stewart beats his jokes to death with a redundancy that you never see in his TV show or live performances. I couldn't wait for the Kennedy thing to be over! Maybe the first time he implied that Jack and family were somewhat nastier than the Camelot legend would have you believe, and that they were taking advantage of the poor naive Jewish boy it was mildly amusing. But the same premise is revisited again and again. Actually, it's the ONLY joke in the essay and the majority of the ""essays"" have that same problem. Stewart is a smart and funny guy, but I suspect he is more comfortable with briefer bits of humor."
5,funniest book I ever read,"Anybody who didn't like this book, especially for some dumb reason like vulgarness, get with the times. If you don't like a book because it has some bad words in it, go to hell"
3,Funny at times but mostly uneven.,"I love Jon Stewart's stand up and Daily Show delivery and I was really expecting a lot from this book. And while it is very funny in spots I found that more often than not it wasn't. For me the variety of styles presented in the book, THe interviews, the diaries, the ancient scrolls, threw me off and I never really settled into a comedy groove. By the end of the book the ideas are definitely more solid and the chuckes come in bunches. The waiter at the last supper memoir is hilarious and so is the Hitler/Larry King interview. But infortunately, for me those were the exception to the rule."
3,Dissappointed Fan,"I'm a huge JS fan (I watch The Daily show, uh, daily) and I was not too impressed with this book. It had a few guffaws -- paticularly the weekend with JFK and the transcripts of the AOL chat hall -- but it mostly only ""mildly amusing.""Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was hoping for more."
5,Brilliant!,"I read this book in one sitting, on the plane, with a bunch of people looking at me like I'm some kind of weirdo, constantly laughing and not giving a fart what people think. I loved this book. It's very direct, brutally funny and witty. Jon Stewart is a comic genius!"
1,"I agree with those who say ""disappointing.""","Like the other 1 star reviewers, I was looking forward to reading this, but I have to agreewith them that it's not very funny, considering how funny he is on TV. I have read it all, andit's as if he's trying to imitate the humor of Woody Allen in his writing. Borrow it from the library,is my advice."
4,Semi-Brilliant Comedy,"I love The Daily Show, and Stewart never fails to make me laugh when I watch it.The book has some low points, such as the chat room bit. The highlights include the Hitler interview, the Princess Diana letters to St. Teresa, and the Kennedy Compound story was a stitch.What comes out of this book is very intelligent comedy. Stewart strikes me as being something of an intellectual. The humor may be too dry for some, but speaking for myself, this book was right up my alley."
3,A few gems in an otherwise uninspired collection of nonsense,"Jon Stewart, a comedian worthy of the high praise he is receiving for his work on The Daily Show on Comedy Central, has put together a book, a book in name only because it is more of a collection of very short stories, that while quite funny at times, falls far short of what I have come to expect from this intelligent, irreverant funnyman. Please don't get me wrong, the book is worth buying and reading just for the sake of the few great chapters (The Cult, The Devil and William Gates, and Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Cold). Give it a read and I think you'll be glad you did, but don't expect this to be the funniest book you've ever read or you will be sorely disappointed."
3,Good...,"I adore watching Jon Stewart on the Daily Show, my favorite show. And while this book was clever, it was a little less than I expected from Jon. Some of the stories were great, like the Last Supper, Hanson Christmas, Revenge... and the New Judaism; but I only got a few really good laughs out of this book. Some didn't even come close, like Martha Stewart. Not because I'm offended by the vagina but it just wasn't funny. Overall I'd say the book is more clever than ha ha funny. Still, it's enjoyable, and I'm still a huge Jon Stewart fan."
1,"Like Jon Stewart, but awful book.","Have you ever gotten that embarrassed feeling for someone? Y'know, you just want to cringe and make it stop. Well, that's the way I felt about this book. Jon Stewart, who is funny on T.V., is painfully unfunny in print. This book was a chore to read. I felt so bad for Mr. Stewart because he so clearly embarrasses himself with this book. I wish his editor would've stepped in and protected him from doing this. Stick to T.V., Mr. Stewart, you're no Mark Twain. Yikes!"
1,The Dead Horse Groans,"This post-Arsenio endeavors to compel a disinterested audience to a true Utopia: the nowhere where anywhere is funnywear. Jon's cheeks are too big for his tongue, and self-deprecation reaches a seventh degree of separation. Every joke is purported to possess a grain of truth, but in Jon's case, one must be a child of the corn to taste a sour mash. Simply: I don't get it! It ain't funny! It's bad! Smarmy isn't campy, and Jon isn't either. The horror, the schmorror. Back to you, Jon."
2,"If you don't expect too much, you won't be let down","What is amazing about Jon Stewart is that he keeps getting good jobs despite his failures. He currently works the Daily Show, despite every other show he had bottoming out. This book is a demostration of why he has failed.Many of the jokes/stories in this book are old jokes that he recycled and put a slightly new twist on. For example, how many jokes about the Kennedy family can be funny? While the new twists are often creative, they fail to actually be FUNNY! The story about Hitler 2000 was creative, but it was not laugh out loud funny. Also, the new Judiasm joke was humorous, but most people do not have the funny bone for Jewish jokes. Otherwise, Woody Allen would still be huge.In this book, Jon Stewart tries to be something he is clearly not, funny. George Carlin knows how to write a humorous book. Stewart knows how to luck out and get good tv jobs and book deals with little talent. The high ratings for this book are fraudulent."
2,stewart book,"The service from the bookseller was just great, book as promised. However, the contents of the book were disappointing. It just didn't sound like Jon Stewart - book was for my 19 year-old son who was expecting something different than the content of this book."
3,Mean,"I thought ""America"" was hilarious so I bought this book. It was funny, but not ""laugh out loud on the floor"" funny- rather mildly amusing, and I felt bad about finding it funny at all because the humor was so mean spirited. Not ""mean but funny anyway"", like the show, just mean."
2,Not So Great,"You have to remember what makes Jon Stewart funny on TV. It is not only his lines, but his delivery and accompanying facial expressions. Some of the vignettes in this book could be funny with his delivery. Some would not be even amusing with Mr. Stewart delivering them at his best.The book is made up of various vignettes about people living, dead and fictitious. I found some mildly amusing (like Bill Gates and some of the Jewish humor), some awful (cult leader) and some that were amazingly dated for a 1999 publication (the Hansens).Even if you are a big Stewart fan I think you will find yourself skipping and skimming through much of this book. My advice would be to close the book and watch ""The Daily Show""."
1,Wish I could have given it ZERO stars!,"What an enormous waste of money and time. I LOVE John Stewart - really, I do! It's why I bought the book. But there wasn't a funny thing about it. Nothing at all. I read every page, waiting for the giggles to happen - as I plainly knew they would. But again, nothing.I am very disappointed. Maybe his humor just doesn't translate well to the printed page.I'll keep watching the Daily Show and his movies though."
4,"Stewart's sarcastic, witty humor proves entertaining","I picked up this book because I'm a huge fan of Jon Stewart's sarcastic, self-depreciating humor on The Daily Show. While I still prefer his in-person standup persona, Naked Pictures of Famous People is, well, funny.The beauty of Stewart's humor is his intelligence, especially in the age of Tom Green, The Man Show, and TV Funhouse. It's comedy for those of us who got over laughing at someone getting hit in the nuts round about puberty. This book reemphasizes his intelligence and wit. I'd reccomend it for anyone who is a fan of smart comedy. If you're a Tom Green fan, probably stay away -though in that case, you probably wouldn't be browsing the editorial reviews on Amazon.com anyway. So on second thought, if you're reading this, buy the book."
3,Okay but Not Great!,"Jon Stewart's book, Naked Pictures of Famous People, is a collection of his wicked sense of humor. My favorite part of the book was Larry King interviewing Adolph Hitler. It was wickedly inappropriate but funny as well.There are hits and misses in this book but if you enjoy Jon Stewart's brand of comedy, you will appreciate this book aiming at the ridiculous, seriousness, and the laughter is the best medicine to cure what ails us all to help us readers out of our situation. This book was written before the events of September 11,2001 in a time when it seemed more innocent and maybe offensive.Now after over ten years in print, I am still surprised but not shocked that it's still being published. Maybe we just need a dose of his humor to keep us going out in their real world."
2,had a moment,"Just as the title of this review states, that's all it had, just A moment. I really only laughed once throughout the whole thing. As I was reading it I could feel the disgusted look on my face, as if I was watching a car accident. I wanted it to be funny, but it just wasn't. I read the excerpt that Amazon gave on it, and that one bit was funny, just that ONE bit. Not even the rest of the Hitler interview was that funny. I tried to finish it but I simply couldn't. I tried to give it two stars, to be nice, but I just couldn't, so, for it making me laugh but only once, I give it one star."
1,I love Jon Stewart on The Daily Show but....,I didn't enjoy this book. Maybe I'm just not savvy enough to pick up Jon's brilliance but for me most of the chapters just fell flat. There were some portions that were minorly amusing but I expected great stuff and it wasn't there.
1,Painfully not funny,"I was so so so dissapointed. Stewart's humor in this book resembles a 12 year old trying so hard to be funny, and failing miserably. He looks for any place to throw in a stupid punch line that any child could write and then the stories themselves lead to predictable, and dissapointing conclusions.It's so sad how pathetic this book is. It almost hurt to read. Please do not read this, it makes me think less of Jon Stewart though I love the Daily Show and America."
2,Humor not as sharp as his show,"I got this book because I enjoy watching the The Daily Show, however was very disappointed after reading the book. Stewart's attempts at short stories fall short - way short. I gave his book two stars because I did enjoy one of the stories, but the rest didn't entertain me. I bought this book based on several positive reviews, but if you're thinking about purchasing a humor book, look elsewhere such as Steve Martin's Pure Drivel."
3,Why Do they Pick little people...,Why did they pick to talk about Hanson? They only did it to get girls to try and read..And Martha Streward? John Steward only did it cuase she has his last name. He tried to pick topics to get demographics. NOT WORKING. And don't diss Jews.
2,Humor?,I can not believe some of the reviews of this book call it educated humor. I think a pull my finger joke would have more humor than some of these stories. They are terrible. How many Jew jokes can a guy get away with? I am offended and would recommend that you buy something with real wit!
1,Don't waste your money,"An embarrassingly mind-numbing, unfunny attempt by a very good on-air comedian to translate into print. The sort of book that you can't wait to put down in order to pick up something hialrious like the telephone directory. 1 star rated only because there is no zero star rating available."
4,Great Product,"This is indeed a good product, very high quality cables, but when they arrived I learned that you could get the same thing at local retailers for about $5 cheaper. That is not a big deal, but that is the reason I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars."
3,Way smaller than i expected,"Will do the job but are really tiny. If you have issues looking through a tiny peep hole, stay away from these."
4,Lullabys of Birdland,"In the 50's and 60's Chris Connor was my favorite jazz singer. I lost a disc of hers in Hurricane Katrina, and I wanted one of her discs. I like this one, but it was not my favorite. I may look for some others later."
4,Good information but images are bit dated,"I enjoyed this program very much. The images were a bit dated, but I realized this had been produced 10 years prior. The information I got I consider to be timeless."
2,Cute but crummy,"This phone is a cute pink color, but that's about all it has going for it. It has poor connectivity. The internet speeds are incredibly slow. My fiance had the silver version, but his had raised buttons, whereas the pink's are flat. It's much harder to blindly press, since you can't feel individual buttons. You basically have to dial with your fingernails. My screen frequently goes blank, but always eventually comes back. The volume at the highest level is poor. You can't hear or be heard if there is ANY wind outside.Buy a better phone than this one."
5,UH-HUH,Nothing can be finer then John Melloncamp. This guy has a killer voice and it's just great music. He's a true delight
5,Good Old Rock n Roll,"I heard this album the first time around (back in the late 80's) and found it just flowed with strong up-beat songs: great guitar, great hard-hitting drums and John Cougar's singing had real attitude. It was my favorite album to chase away the stresses of the day and to get my feet tapping. The first two tracks (Crumblin' Down and Pink Houses) set the pace.By the time 'Serious Business' came on you were probably strutting around the room with an air guitar! These days, we get to listen to the whole album without having to flip the black vinyl over -Bliss! Enjoy."
5,Uh-Huh,"I bought this used at The Record Shop for 5 bucks. It was worth 5 times that much. This is John's closest to a hard rock album he's ever made.Crumblin' Down- Great opener filled with energy and great vocals.Pink Houses- Great song many people think this is his best (I think Jack and Diane is).Authority Song- Awesome boogie guitar at the begining and great guitar solo a the end. With great vocals all the way through.Warmer Place To Sleep- Includes many references to the Bible (for 40 days and 40 nights I slept out in the rain) and he would trade it all for a warmer place to sleep. Great hard-rocker.Jackie O.- I don't get it, but I like itPlay Guitar- This is another song The Best I Could Do 1978-1988 forgotSerious Business- Awesome hard rockin' songLovin' Mother For Ya- Weird song. Awesome song.Golden Gates- Beautiful balladThe special thanks on this album was The Rolling Stones and i really think that John & his band sound alot like the rolling stones on this album."
2,A Little Disappointing,"I purchased this CD after buying ""Lonesome Jubilee"" which I loved. I have to say I was disappointed. Besides the songs I bought the CD for, ""Crumblin' Down"" and ""Pink Houses"", I found it hard to get into the other songs. You may disagree - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it."
4,"Very good, but somewhat obsolete","This CD compiles everything recorded by Blind Willie McTell for the Library of Congress, including a handful of often fascinating monologues (or, in some cases, dialogues with the ageing and obviously racist John A. Lomax).The sound is reasonably good, and there are plenty of excellent cuts here, some blues tunes, and numerous religious songs as well. McTell's playing is masterful as always...the only ""problem"" with this CD is that all of these tracks are available on JSP's phenomenal Willie McTell-box set ""The Classic Years 1927-1940"", so there's really not much point in going out and buying this disc unless you already have McTell's commercial sides and just want the LoC recordings to go with them."
1,such a unique material,"I really did not understand that nearly one month they could not send my shampoo order.Just shampoo!!And there was no warn about the supplier stocks or another notice,still I do not know why still I am waiting?More than this I can not cancel my order I have to wait whenever They decide to send my order even it will be along time.."
5,super good,Cant go wrong with Cables-To-Go brand. This is probably by 20th cable that I've gotten. they are all made professionally with proper patching on both ends. Not only its a CAT5e cable but its also shielded so perfect combo. I use those for our Servers. Shipped on time from the seller.
5,ZZZZenZZZZational Book!,"I checked Zeee out from the library numerous times when I was a child. It has now been re-published for the next generation of children to read. Zeee is a delightful story with wonderful pictures. It makes you want to search your own backyard for a fairy. The story: Zeee has emotional trials and tribulations while trying to find the perfect home. Every time she thinks she has found a wonderful location, a human destroys it. It's a delightful story and I highly recommend it a ""must-have&quot"
5,Zeee not thumbelina,"My mother always told me to keep my books, I'm glad that she did too. Out of the drew books from her childhood this is my favorite, while not as popular as thumbelina may be zeee is by far my favorite little fairy book. Zeee is the perfect book for one looking for a strong female fairy character that does not play into the typical type casting and plot line, it helps that she has a lot of spunk too. Good for any little girl whos into faries."
2,Too wimpy to make baby food,"I bought this blender to replace my Cuisinart Smart Stick after my husband dropped and broke it... The low price of this blender convinced me (warily) to try this one. It seems to have short blades, and really they didn't seem sharp when I felt them. Maybe the motor itself doesn't have much power. But for whatever reason, this thing just wouldn't blend the baby food smooth. I did peas and okra. I could only get the peas to a 3rd foods consistency and the okra never got close to smooth enough to feed my baby. I ended up dirtying the big food processor to finish the process. This blender is half the price of the Cuisinart, but really we're only talking the difference between $14 and $28. I suggest shelling out the $28 to get a much better item."
4,Good for the price,"I needed something for our second home. The blender seems to work great. It is very simple, and nothing fancy. Good value for the price. I would like it better if the blade end could somehow be detached from the handpiece/motor area for cleaning purposes--I am always worried about getting the handpiece wet."
4,So easy to use,"This blender does exactly what is says it will, and makes clean up so so easy. The only thing about it is that the blade is small so it can take a few minutes to really puree something, but I think the ease and convenience of it makes it worth the time. 1000 times easier to use this than to transfer something to the food processor and then back to the pot. Love this hand blender."
2,PS Hand blender,I was disappointed in this blender. It stalled and seemed to lack the power to remix peanut butter. It also lacked n removable housing and blade for washing.
1,Blew up in my hand!!,"This product just blew up in my hand, sparks and all! It also caused the plugs in my house to short out and nothing else was running off that socket either! I was making mashed potatoes and it just couldn't handle the job. Besides it being somewhat uncomfortable to hold down the button I do not believe this product is very safe. You are not supposed to run it for more than a minute at a time but this probably won't happen unless you have huge hands- to grip the shaft and push the button gets tiring. I've only used this mixer maybe 3 times before it blew up. It remained hot for a long time after blowing sparks at me and smelled like it was burning from the inside out. Next time I will spend a little more money and get a mixer that lasts my whole life (or at least a really long time)."
2,"A toy, not a serious utensil","Only for SMALL pots/bowls; can only be immersed 4 inches. Does not separate (like the Braun models). As a result, the blender cannot be put into a dishwasher for real cleaning. Spend a bit more, get a better model."
1,Not Happy... Blew on the first use.,"I bought this to use in home made soap making, using it as recommended in 20-30 second bursts (in a liquid about as thick as hand lotion) and then *poof* it blows a fuse and I'm finishing by hand. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER."
2,"OK, not great","This blender is not nearly as good as theCuisinart CSB-76BC. I bought the proctor silex because it cost so little and because I wanted a mixer for blending protein powder at work. It does the job, but not nearly as well as the Cuisinart. In fact, if the proctor silex had been my first immersion blender I'd have thought the entire concept was a fad.Still, at 13 bucks I'm glad I tried it out. I'll probably keep using it at work until it breaks or until I find a unit that fits better into a coffee cup."
5,Better than a regular blender for most jobs,"I am using this as a substitute for a regular blender. It's much easier to clean. All you have to do is rinse it under the faucet. I use it to blend soups right in the pot, vinaigrettes in a glass, and fruit/yogurt in a bowl. It's fast and easy. For large quantities you'll need a regular blender, but for small quantities this thing is a breeze."
3,Proctor Silex 59735 Immersion Hand Blender,If you add ice to your smoothie...it must be small chips of ice for this blender to handle the job...but for the price...it's great!
4,soap making,"blended a 3 pound mixture of oils and lye - and of the methods tested, this blender gave me the best results (compared to a drill with a paint blender) - adequate and affordable"
4,Hand blender,"Was skeptical at first because the blades were so small (not like my original one), however, it gets the job done very well. Not difficult to hold the button in as someone else had mentioned. The price was right fo what I wanted. Great for fresh sauces, figs, fruit -- instead of getting the blender out & messing up so many dishes or taking the time to chop."
5,NIce blender for the price!,Great blender! Proctor Silex has made a good quality inexpensive kitchen tool which is very useful.
3,Not much power.,"This blender is definitely not for anything major. I didn't expect it to have such little power. It took ages to blend cooked vegetables in soup but would be OK for blending ice cream or a powdered drink. I had a Braun one that could blend raw fruit. There is no way this one would. Also you can't immerse it very far so as I said if you're looking to blend a big pot of soup, which is what I was hoping to do, you're out of luck."
1,Stopped working in less than two months,"I got this for soap making. It worked fine, except that you can't immerse it more than four inches, which was a pain with the bigger batches. It turned out to be a piece of junk. Stopped working in less than two months, right in the middle of my fifth batch of soap. It is completely dead, and, of course, there's no way to open it up and look inside to see what's broken and maybe fix it. I'm trying to return it, but amazon wants me to pay for the original shipping and the return shipping. Not exactly fair given that their product is faulty."
1,Broke after second use. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.,"My first use of this product I was impressed. The second was a different story. It short circuited and tripped the breaker to the kitchen. A second attempt caused the same results instantly. It wasn't even in use at the time but still caused the breaker to flip and the device to become extremely hot. Faulty manufactoring and a product so sub-par that not only does it not work, it's most likely and electrical and safety hazard. Review: not only is it useless, it's basically dangerous."
4,Nice item for the money you pay,My wife found this item handy and very useful. It does the job perfectly... It could have been even better if the bottom portion be removable. That would have made me give a perfect 5 star.
1,Disappointment,Simply put: If you are trying to blend shakes with ice do not purchase this product. Very dissapointing purchase. Ended up tossing it and purchasing the cuisinart.
2,Not good for smoothies,"Do not use this blender to chop ice cubes. I tried and it shorted out the motor, tripping the circuit breakers in my house, and does so every time it is plugged in. Works great at blending thin items like soup and protein shakes, but don't use it for thicker items like milk shakes."
1,a big help for aching hands,"Obviously, there are a lot of uses for an immersion blender, but I got it to aid me in one particular task that has been nearly impossible with arthritic hands and a potato masher -- smashing beans for burrito filling! Beans do not mash easily with a potato masher (they slide out from under mostly), and that was very hard on my arthritic hands and wrists. The blender did a bang-up job on the beans, which couldn't get away from it as I moved it around, and up and down in a large, flat pan. I could've gotten the mixture even smoother if I'd wanted, and all in just two or three minutes. It was a bit noisy, but the vibration actually felt good to my hands, and clean up was a cinch. I look forward to using it on many other things that would be a trial to do by hand or any other method."
3,A little underpowered,"This blender is good, but has a tough time with ice... if you are expecting to make smoothies with it, then you have purchased the wrong blender.Thankfully, I purchased it to blend up food in the sauce pot, so it works great for me."
1,Stuff Gets Stuck In Blender Base,"I bought this hand blender to make smoothies. All it has to do is blend berries, bananas, and yogurt in a cup.But the berries get jammed in the teeth of the base. The banana doesn't get mushed, and the whole thing is just a noisy mess. And no blending.I'm returning it. NOT recommended."
3,Not bad for the price.,"Its simple and works fine for the price, the only draw back is that it can only go into liquid about 3 or 4 inches."
4,Quiet and powerful,"It's a rather nice device. It fits in the hand well, doesn't make too much noise, and is easy to clean. My only complaint is that I bought it to use in preparing frozen concentrated juices, and the guard makes it fairly useless in that role."
4,Immersion Blender by Proctor suits my needs.,"I bought the Proctor Silex blender to help me mix my ingredients during soapmaking in a crock pot.It worked very well. I was worried about it being too strong and spitting the mix out of the bowl but it didn't. I am happy with my blender. I think I will purchase another one soon to use for food. Thanks !!!Soapmaking the Natural Way: 45 Melt-and-Pour Recipes Using Herbs, Flowers & Essential Oils"
4,Thank God!!!!!,"I am so happy to hear some new material from Steph. She is, by far, one of our best ""real"" singers of our time. Technology had taken over the industry. But thank God for singers like Steph, Aretha, Mariah, and Whitney, who can really work without the extra help.I was wishing for something more from Steph on this cd, but after being out of the game for such a long period of time, I think this is really a nice effort to re-introduce herself to the music world.I have followed her from album, to cassette, and on to cd. She is a trooper. And I am so proud to be a fan.Stephanie was ""Born For This.""I can't wait for her next cd."
3,Money well Spent...So to Speak.,"I'm glad that I bought this CD although I feel that a collection of songs from Miss Mills, one of the finest musician/singers alive, could have been much much much better. This CD is nowhere nearly as well done as Regina Belle's ""Lazy Afternoon"" for instance. Too bad that Miss Stephanie couldn't have had George Duke produce her CD.However! I'm not sorry that I bought ""Born For This"" because I REALLY like two of the offerings in this collection. Born for This and Baby Love are songs that highlight her unquestionably wondrous voice and if there had been only one song that I liked ... it still would have been worth it just to hear Stephanie Mills Sing something new !!! Gotta Love Her ~"
3,Pleasant surprise,"Browsing through the store one day, I noticed this cd. Reading the titles, I thought it was a collection cd with a few new cuts. With the exception of one song, it's all new, and with the exception of 2 songs, I really enjoyed this cd. Stephanie hasn't changed her style; she's stuck to the audience that knows and enjoys her music which I appreciate since so many other artists have been doing that lately (i.e., Tamia). No, there aren't any Grammy-winning tunes here, but it's good listening for Stephanie's fans."
1,A Failed Attempt,"""Born For This"" was supposed to be Mills' comeback album. Up to this point, she had not recorded an R&B;/Pop album in over 10 years so people were expecting Stephanie to return in a big way. Sadly, it did not happen.The CD faired very modestly on the Billboard R&B; charts, peaking at #25, while a single release failed to chart at all. Sadly, the album missed the Pop charts altogether. While Mills was in fine voice throughout this disc, every song she was given to sing was pure rubbish, nothing befitting of a vocalist of her legendary status. I was very saddened and disappointed to see her reduced to this. Mills has not resurfaced with any new material since this disc. I hope next time around, she is able to find a label who will put her with producers willing to supply her with quality material. My advice to anyone thinking of purchasing this disc is to SKIP IT. This is, by far, the worst album in Stephanie's discography."
1,AWFUL!,"I WAS SO GLAD TO HEAR STEPHANIE HAD A NEW CD OUT, I LISTENED TO THE FIRST THREE SONGS ON THE CD AT THE MUSIC STORE, THEY SOUNDED PRETTY NICE, SO I PURCHASED THE CD. I GOT HOME AND COULDN'T WAIT, I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THE REST, EVEN THE REMAKE OF NEVER NEW LOVE WAS AWFUL,"
1,Nobody should be BORN FOR THIS!,"I have been a fan since The Wiz , so was curious to find what she had been up to...whatever it was she should still be doing it. I bought this cd to listen to on a car trip...my first impression was the voice is still strong but the material seems repetitive and weak (i then pulled out the liner notes and read that she had written a majority of the songs...big mistake!) on 2nd listening i had other people in the car who were willing to pay me to change cd's or they were going to slice their wrists. not only is the song choices poor ..she sounds off-key and over emoting on several songs. This is my first review, but after reading the others on this CD, I felt I needed to warn you...I don't get what the other reviewers are talking about and after the second listening it is out of my disc player and on its way to used cd store!"
1,So many technical errors! Burn this book!,"I went through chapter 4 ""WDM Network Design -1"" of this book. I found so many annoying technical errors and inaccuracies, almost on all pages, of this chapter. It appears that authors copied various material and formula from various sources without fully understanding the material. In my view this kind of technical publication does more harm than service.The book still may be useful if you are looking for only general ideas on the subject, but if you need accurate technical information, forget it."
5,Best book on Optical Networking,The book is an excellent source of information for network design and product development. It covers all aspects of optical network design. No other book covers this aspect of network design as this one does. Network classificaiton and explanation is very contemporary and cutting edge technologies are shown in the manuscript. The futures section covers technologies that seem most appropriate for real time networks. The simulation software is useful for physical layer design as well as network layer routing and wavelength assignment strategies....Looking to a second edition hopefully soon..Vik
2,Cutscene after cutscene.. more like watching an animated movie.,"If you like watching animated movies, especially foreign Asian animation, you might like this game because that is what you do in Jade Empire. If you like some good button mashing and then watching cutscene after cutscene after cutscene, then this might be the game for you. I like SOME cutscenes in my games, but too many will take me out of the immersion factor. Also, the graphics in Jade Empire just feel cartoony.Your character fights scripted linear enemies and then triggers another cutscene. Then your silent voiced character will have choices of dialog to select from leading eventually down the path of good or evil. Once you choose your dialog, you continue to the next cutsene. I just couldn't get into this game no matter how hard I tried."
4,Jade Empire SE,"This is a stable game with excellent graphic and a very good story line. The controls are simple and easy to learn. Unfortunately it is a bit on the short side, it took me only 14 hours to finish the game my first time.There are a number of subplots, but they don't take long to complete. The romantic subplots for male characters are good and varied, female characters have only two options.While the story is a bit lacking for replay, the combat options are keeping my interest. I have just started my third game. My wife completed it once and is likely to play through it again soon.Personal RatingGraphics: AStability: AControls: ACombat Options: ACharacter Customization: C+Story Depth: A-Story Length: CReplay Value: C+Overall I give Jade Empire SE a solid B.I honestly found the Rhino Demon exclusive combat style to be of little value. But it is a cool little bonus that is fun to play around with once or twice."
1,Fun but terminates way too early,This game came highly recommended. I can see why. I can also assume that it wasn't the PC version of the game.Good side: Epic martial arts action. Nicely developed storyline. Easy controls. Lush graphics (though a little dated).Bad side: No hopes at all for a patch. Every so often the camera would get stuck with your nose in the ground with no hope of getting it back out except through either leaving the area or reloading the game. Was unable to progress past 2nd chapter because of scripting errors. http://jade.bioware.com/forums/viewforum.html?forum=102 for all the information. No chance for a patch.
4,easy and fun and pretty to look at,"Very beautiful game world, interesting character abilities and combat, decent little quests and storyline, and even some arcade-like fun. This was a blast."
2,I only found 2 songs on this cd to be worth anything,"Those 2 songs are ''Road to bonoa'' [First and by far the greatest song on this cd] and ''The purging''. This album is mostly mediocre and dated. I bought this cd at a christian store for like $2. And i guess i really got what i paid for. The music on here is played well, But like the previous reviewer stated, The lyrics were mostly horrible. If the lyrics were better [Even though the music to them hasn't aged very well], This could've been a great christian rock album for its time. I can't really imagine anyone really wanting to find this album and from the forgettable material on this album to the downright stupid lyrics, It's very easy to understand why this album is currently out of print and long forgotten about. Asightunseen might have been something worth investing time into if the music had a more lasting impact. Hope the review helped. Be blessed."
1,Dangerous trip thanks to Let's Go.,"My (military) boyfriend and I (Italian student... book was my idea) stayed at a Milanese hotel suggested by this AWFUL guidebook.The place was lousy, run down and more expensive than stated on the book.While in the restroom, I overheard a conversation during which the receptionist told someone to watch us and follow us because my guy was in the U.S. Military.We packed our bags in one minute and ran to the police, where an inspector of the Special Ops unit warmly recommended us to stear clear from the hotels suggested by Let's Go, as they often turn out to be bad surprises!Follow the cop's wise suggestion and get a better, more serious book!!!"
1,Too Small To Be Useful,"I was very excited to receive these, but when they arrived and I opened the package I was speechless. These bowls are FAR too small to be useful for anything more than a condiment cup. They are literally smaller than an infant's bowl. I will be returning these, as they are no use to me whatsoever."

5,great find,I was having problems with my septic system and was told to buy some kind of grease remover. I have used this product and it works really fast and what a difference it makes. I would recommend it 100%
1,DISAPPOINTING AND NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"The promise of a comprehensive guide to assist you in starting your own collection agency,is not even remotely delivered. The points in the book are 100% vague. Not enough specifics, not even more information than basic research would provide. [...] I wasted money on this book If you are going to waste money as well then make sure NOT to order the ebook version. At least by ordering the regular book, you can send it back and hope that she deems it in good enough condition to sell. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE !"
1,Do not waste your money,"This book has nothing you cannot find on the internet in 5 minutes. Very general and a waste of money.So general it tells you how to get website hosting, and what software to buy like office 2000..Most peolpe that did not know that would not be ordering this book anyway.Not even the picture on the cover is on book instead she makes a postcard and sticks it in the book., its more like the whole book was copied on a cheap printer and put together...only thing of value was a few links for skip tracing in back, but a search engine revealed that as well...You have been warned...Try any another book beside this.."
2,Save your Money,Save the $29.99 for a printer ink cartridge to print all the information you need from the Internet.I read this booklet in 20 minutes and then returned it day I recieved it.I found way more free information on the Internet about the collection business than this booklet provided.Go to your local Library and check out Collection Agency Harassment: What the dept collector doesn't want you to know.by Richard L. DiMaggioI read this book while waiting for Starting a Collection Business booklet.This book was written by a lawyer who collected depts.Read this book to find the proper way to collect dept following the FDCPA and keep yourself from being sued.It also has collection form letters that follow FDCPA.Also register with Collection Insustry.com (Free) for the latest Collection Industry news.Follow these free steps and use Google and Yahoo search engines to find vast amounts of information about the collection business.Good Luck... Mark D.
1,Don't believe the positive reviews - this is JUNK!,"Do you have time and money to waste? Then buy this book. If you want to get the real answers or a true guide for starting a home based collections agency, THIS IS NOT IT!In my opinion, it is generic - simple - vague - short - and a waste of time. It does not give a detailed outline or a complete process needed to start a collection biz.Very VERY dissapointing product."
4,Great,I am hoping that by watching Italian movies with English subtitles this may help me understand and speak the language. Good comedy
4,LAUGH AWAY your BACK-TO-SCHOOL BLUES ?,"Feel those heart jitters? That's a genuine reaction from a heart-squeezing, fast-moving comedy about Marco Sperelli a teacher from uppity Northern Italy who is assigned - mistakenly - to teach street-smart third graders in a town near Naples.The language might singe my ears if i understood Italian - - even so, a few asterisks or bleeps wouldn't be out-of-place! *Ciao* is vulgar & leaning toward an X-rating but it has just the right mix of garlic, laughter and truly heart-felt *lessons*.Reviewer mcHAIKU would be surprised if you didn't want to watch more than once this Professore bumbling along . . . confronted by some pretty amazing young actors. Don't let *Back-to-School Sales* get you down - - check out *CIAO, PROFESSORE!* for a busload of laughs."
4,"Cia, Professore !","Ciao, Professore ! is a very funny and outrageous movie not to be missed.I love Lina Wermuller's films, and I own most of her movies on DVD."
5,Believe the name,Bought this to supplement recipes. Great to add to store bought chicken stock to deepen the flavor. Thought it might be too salty. Wasn't.
3,good but not the best,The better then bouillon is very good but has a hint of a sweet taste that my family dosen't seem to care for.
2,Bland,"Disclaimer: I am a salt-junkie, so that might explain my disappointment. But it really lacked in depth also. I tasted it unwatered when it became obvious that it was too weak for my use and there seemed to be an excessive amount of filler--it had a flour roux-like weight on the tongue that didn't dissolve. And I was making soup stock (not broth or bouillon) and it took three times the recommended measure to bring it up to snuff. It might be fine for those with more sensitive taste, but I wouldn't buy again."
1,this was not what I wanted. I was looking for a powder base for gravy.,"When purchasing this item from Amazon, I thought that the product was a powder base for a chicken gravy. I followed the instruction on making the gravy but I had to add more mixture. Not very happy with this purchase."
5,Better Than Bouillon,"This chicken flavor is really delicious in recipes. Everyone in the family enjoys it. I find the flavor is much more robust and rich than other products, and the price is right."
5,Chicken Base,I add this to all my chicken dishes for excelent flavor. Have given this product to family and friends to introduce them to it.
2,"Has an off-taste, weak","I was really excited by Better Than Bouillon. Especially when making risotto, I have been searching for a good chicken bouillon to make life easier.Preparing it is very simple, and the jar sits easily in the fridge.The taste is, however, lack luster. I found myself adding extra just to get any real flavor, and even then, there was no strong chicken taste. Didn't serve to heighten the flavors, or add aroma.Given the high price (and the Amazon price is higher than in many stores), this isn't worth it. Knorr's very salty bouillon is still better."
2,"Good information, slam to defense biomechanics.","This book is a good summary of the available literature for biomechanics accident reconstruction. Where the reviewed literature is often used by defense experts, the author takes personal criticism at the defense experts for using this literature in assessing injury potential. This is done quite often to a point where it is rediculous and quite defamatory. It is obvious from this book that the author has aligned himself with the plaintiff side of low speed collision analysis. I would not recommend this book if your looking for literature on this matter which is impartial."
4,A must read,"This book (2nd edition) is quite comprehensive and largely covers all issues relating to its title. Personally I found the book very informative and a great guide to the field it is intended to cover. Anyone wanting to learn more about the field of studies it addresses should most definitely have read this book. Clearly the author/s are well versed with the subject matter, as is evident from the interrelated subject matter diversity of the book. Surprisingly, considering the volume, the manner in which it is compiled and written makes for somewhat easy reading."
4,Statlers 10th anniversary,Good Album. Clay Kentucky and One Less Day to go are favorites. I think there is a youtube of One Less day to go performed on Pop Goes the Country.
1,crap,don't get it found it boring and crappy acting and will not suggest it to any one ever that bad.
4,An Interesting Concept,"""Homer's Daughter"" does not compare favorably to ""I, Claudius""--Graves does not write a woman's voice convicingly. Still, the idea behind this novel is an interesting one. I can well believe after reading it that the ""Odyssey"" could have been written by a woman. The main character, Nausicaa, is likeable and spirited.As an ""Odyssey"" fan, it was a lot of fun seeing how Graves set up the story as parallel to ""The Odyssey""--the sort of situation that could have inspired it. The setting, in actual historic Greece/Mediteranean, not a mythical setting, was well-drawn and interesting. I would recommend this novel as a thought-provoking read for someone who is well-familiar with ""The Odyssey""."
4,An Unseen World In Your Backyard,"Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou created one of the most arresting nature films of the year in 1996 with their Microcosmos which won the Technical Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The film depicts in stunning close up the lives of the insects in a meadow in Aveyron, France. We see ants and bees as they go about the business of pollination, we have the mating ritual of snails, the battle of horned beetles and perhaps most stunning the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly and the birth of a mosquito.The photography is stunning and carries the film. The dialogue by Kristen Scott Thomas is minimal. The idea here is to show that mother nature is the greatest special effects creator of all. The music by Bruno Coulais fits the mood perfectly. This is a great film for the entire family and comes highly recommended. The disc contains no special features but viewing the film is all one really needs.Excellent"
3,Not up to par,"Compared to Baraka, Koyanisquatsi and others films of the same genre', this one lacks the magic and artistic qualities that have made some of the others such landmarks in filmography."
2,Beautiful pictures but boring,"I am a fan of Nature movies, and with my son, can watch 10 hours of Nature DVD in one sitting ! But not this one ! Although some pictures are really nice, the real-time emergence of the mosquito got a biiiiiiitttttt tooooooooo ssssssllllloooowwww !! ( you know what I mean ? ) And the lack of narration meant that if you knew what you were looking at, great ! otherwise, good luck trying to determine what insect or flower you were looking at and why !The only reason this is not a 1 is that there are some nice segments, but that is only about 10 minutes. The other 60 minutes are a dooozer ! ( hey, this is a great DVD if you can not sleep ! )I would rather buy a NATURE DVD ( PBS ) ."
1,"Poor movie structure and content, but with shiny, pretty images","If you are looking for a Nature documentary and would like to learn more about invertebrate biology, then look elsewhere. This movie is a bit like a silent-era movie, but played by small, incognito alien creatures. In Microcosmos, no effort is made to explain or describe, the scenes that are presented. Though or perhaps because the images are gorgeous, the movie feels even more vacuous and futile.Now, if instead you are moderately- to well-versed in biology and want some stock footage, say, to illustrate a lecture on invertebrate behavior, then this movie is perfect. The bland and sometimes almost vacant soundtrack is not intrusive for a voice-over during lecture. However, you will need to know your invertebrates, for Microcosmos does not mention anything about the rich life it depicts."
3,MicroCosmos,"This film's visulals are astounding. The problem is that with such limited narration you can't always figure out what the insects are doing and why, which is the interesting part to me."
3,I was disappointed at first...,"I was disappointed at first. I was expecting a nature documentary. I wanted to LEARN something. Shortly into the film, however, I realized that learning was not the purpose of this production. Indeed, there is almost no narration at all. The film is simply a montage of nature video focusing on things that are generally too small for most people to notice. Think mainly in terms of bugs.That being said, it is still a stunning achievement. The videography is first rate and engrossing to watch. The images are superb. I only wish there was some narration to go with it.This is a GOOD film. It is worth watching for its own sake. For what it is, I would give it 5 stars. For what I wanted, I give it 2. I am listing it as 3. I am disappointed in that it is not what I sought but it was worth watching.This is worth the money especially if you enjoy brilliant nature footage. Be prepared to be engrossed by the images. Be prepared to wish you had some explanations to go with them."
2,Don't get this one for the kids.,"The fascination of absolutely gorgeous photography wanes as the puzzling insect antics remain unexplained. My 6-year-old and I are great fans of all that's to do with creepy crawlers, but within 10 minutes, he lost interest. If your kid sits still and doesn't ask questions, this movie is fine; otherwise, buy this movie for the beauty of the best insect photography I've ever seen--but don't expect to be educated. And don't expect the kids to sit through it."
3,not as thrilling as the Italian versions,"Of course few places inspire such passion as Italy, but I've read the NYC version as well and found it much more intruguing than this one. It seems as if most of the entries concern Georgian architecture and stodgy gardens. Did Thatcher kill lively London?"
3,Great - But it burst my bubble,"A wonderful set but I was disapointed.The album itself contains wonderful recordings and restorations.The only thing is that Ma Rainey was disshelved from the highalter of my admiration.I had thought that Ma Rainey was a GREAT performer. I discoveredthat, although she was a pioneer, she was just a mediocre performer.Maybe having my fantasy replaced by the facts isn't such a badthing after all!"
4,This CD sings!,"I fell in love with this CD the first time I listened to it. Ellis is unnasuming, has a great voice that travels both light and strong respectively. Her playful, unabashed stage presence and banter with the audience makes listening to this CD a uniquely personal experience. This is fresh and very welcome. If you like a bit of folk, accoustic and an engaging voice, you'll love Ellis. Check out her website too at http://ellis-music.com"
4,better than the first,"yes, i have connections and have gained access to initial d: battle 2 a week early from its official release. rest assured you will not be dissappointed. if you liked the racing, this one has much more of that and it looks great. the story also progresses deeper and has really got me hooked. ..."
3,"Fantastic Anime, Practically Butchered","I absolutely love Initial D, however, my love for the show is the only thing that is keeping this DVD's rating at 3 stars. The American liscenced version is just plain bad. The three best things about the japanese version of this show are: character interaction, music, and race scenes, all of which have been altered. If you've never seen it I'd say stay away unless you have an interest in cars, then it still MAY be worth your while."
4,Big improvement from the first dvd,"When I first viewed initial d this wasn't like any type of anime that I've seen before. I'm normally into stuff like inuyasha, tenchi muyo etc, but i decided to give initial d a chance. My first review about the akina downhill specialist will tell you a little bit about what I saw and after that dvd I was kinda hooked on the story line. After Tak was on his way to akina I wanted to see the race even though I already knew the result of the race. It's just kinda funny how a old beat up 86' can beat the latest mazda rx-7 fd. I mean the graphics on the character weren't like all of my other anime choices, but I mainly watch this one because of the story line. I just want to see how far they will take this series. So if you want my opinion If you have seen the first dvd and was kinda interested then this dvd is just right for you!!!"
1,forget anything TOKYOPOP brings...,"TOKYOPOP doesn't know anime and transform it into uglyness (change score, characters' names, cut scenes, etc...). Pioneer at least keep the original score and characters' names for their animes."
5,2 is even better than 1,I love Intital D. The storyline gets even better on the second. I can live without Iggy but I guess hes suppose to be the comic relief of the Anime. Anyway this is a must have for car lovers!
5,Classic Album,"Fun House is simply one of the best albums of all time. The production and re-mastering brings out the potency of the Stooges at the top of their game. If you want to hear where ""it"" all came from buy this album.....be one of the cool kids."
5,Pure genius,"This is one of the best albums of all time. If you have any blood in your veins, buy a copy and you won't be disappointed. Dirt is my personal favourite but all the tracks here are absolutely outstanding. Read the other reviews for analysis, ignoring what Howie Tuttleman (probably doesn't really exist and, if he does, with a name like that he is hardly to be taken seriously) and some potential date raper [sic] (another crass hoax which is neither funny nor convincing) have to say. Then get this album and I promise you your life won't be the same again..."
5,Crushing!,"The Stooges at their gutbucket best.They give new meaning to the term""Murder City""and they define what is great about Motown flavored rock.Detroit is underrated as far as rock bands go but Stooges and MC5 make the case that Detroit truly rocks."
5,Essential Rock,"The good folks at Amazon need to list this as one of their ""Essential Recordings"". This cd rocks harder and better than anything I have ever heard .. it just doesn't get any better than this."
5,Buy this!!!,"This is sooo good. it sounds a little like the stones, you also hear some free jazz (which is wild) influence, but basically this is the stooges being the stooges. There's one slow song (""Dirt""), one that's all noise (""L.A.Blues""), and 5 that are wild rock/heavy metal/punk/whatever, a sax player that mixes the wilder side of jazz with Bill Haleys's saxophonist, and great screaming, banging, and freaking out. This is so wild, you'll love it. The Hives do something like this, but this is so much darker and more emotional. The punks in the 70's never came close. AC/DC circa ""TNT"" was this interesting almost, but not so versatile. MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"" may be a LITTLE better, but nothing else is."
4,The Id Personified,"I first heard this anarchic assault in 1977, and have never been the same since. It is Iggy in his most aggressive mode, and no record, not even ""Raw Power"" with its superior production and ferver can come near this dangerous attack upon convention. It is a slap on the face of reality; a goose to the reality that stretches from Iggy's howl on ""Loose"" to the throat-grabbin of ""TV EVE."""
5,Human nature,"Forget the album as a masterpiece, forget it as a landmark, forget the Stooges, forget Iggy Pop, forget what everybody tells you about this recording, forget yourself in desperate search of the truth and just listen to the most raw human nature ever recorded..."
5,Up Close and Personal,"As a native Michigander who saw the Stooges perform this, and the rest of their albums live on many occasions, I can attest to the fact this is the album that best represents the chaos of a live show. From the live shows featuring this music at the Factory Ballroom, Silverbell and the Eastown Theater, the Stooges went beyond their basic cord simplicity on the eponymously titled, first album to an experimental sound that landed Ron Ashton a position in Rolling Stone's top 100 guitarist of all time list. This recording convinced a lot of people that the Stooges were much more than a novelty act."
5,All aboard for fun time...,"Never mind the Mars probe: one listen to Fun House provides all the evidence you need to know that life exists elsewhere in the universe and that it visits the Earth from time to time. This album was so far ahead of its time and so at odds with virtually everything else being done by The Stooges' contemporaries - at least in rock music - that the only possible conclusion is that it was produced by aliens. The reason this album, together with its belated (1973) successor Raw Power, were so influential (and so magnificent) is that they quite simply redefined the limits of rock and roll. No band since has even looked like taking the music beyond this point, established in 1970. That's also why, after hearing this album, most bands today sound old and clichéd and The Stooges sound brand new. I really hope Iggy and the band finally get the credit they deserve as true greats."
5,Fun House - Fun Time *,"Iggy and the Stooges were certainly one of the finest and most innovative Rock acts ever to surface out of the Detroit 60's scene . Well beyond other acts of their time, The Stooges combined a psychedelic and punk style wall of sound... ! Both genres can even to this day site this album as their ultimate influence. Vintage Detroit Rock !"
5,a high that will never again be achieved,"I apoligize if this review is anecdotal and not very analytical. I am an analytical person, however, no music has ever touched me as directly and emotionally, right or wrong, as this album did. I bought this CD on a whim 12 years ago, thinking it was a good novelty album. When I played it the first time, I think I experienced what a heroin addict achieves during their first intravenous injection. During those precious 36 minutes, I became overwhelmed, as I had no idea music such as this existed, lying latent for me to be discovered. I never achieved the same state of gripping awe and wonder as then, and now it is difficult to listen to this album because it is so incredibly draining emotionally."
5,Fantastic,"This is everything you need to know about rock music, boiled down to seven songs. It had ear-splitting force, gritty funk blues and wild sonic abandon. Mostly, its just the sort of god awful racket that you need to shake the cobwebs off of your crusty, dirty soul."
4,As usual Rhino delivers the goods,"""Either you're a fan of Iggy Pop and The Stooges or you're not. I fall into the latter category. Although, I can't deny the raw, underground rock sound that The Stooges helped create on their debut and sophomore albums. With The Stooges you get the original 8 tracks plus the original mixes on the bonus disc that were deemed to artsy back in 1969.With Funhouse, Iggy expands on his lyrical ability; I think these seven songs combined have twice as many words as their debut. The songs on the bonus disc are alternate takes of what turned out to be the final product. As usual Rhino delivers the goods with a combined total of 24 bonus tracks, original artwork, and expanded liner notes."""
5,Classic Stooges,"Funhouse came along during my formative years as a musician and was one of the albums that influenced me most in my own songwriting and playing. When Iggy Stooge began calling himself Iggy Pop, it was the full flowering of punk, a mecca toward which every heavy metal and punk band has been slouching ever since. When you put this cd on and turn your headphones to B-52 take-off, you will hear the distillation of rock influences that formed generations of music, fashion, attitude. Iggy Pop belongs on Mt. Rushmore. Now that we know Thomas Jefferson lied and would have been impeached had DNA testing existed in his era, perhaps we could rechisel his visage, add a ton of black mascara and a dumptruck full of peanut butter and put Iggy where he truly belongs, sneering down on the world he has created out of three chords and Motor City teenage angst."
1,I dont care what u say this isnt punk,"I heard about the stooges on the vh1 punk show and a few people told me this is a clasic punk cd but guess what it aint punk. This sounds like the Rolling Stones or something u have a serius problem if u think its punk. Check out NOFX, Lag wagon, MxPx, American Hifi, Sr-71, SUM41, Good Charlote, or Dead Kennedie's if u want 2 hear what real punk sounds like."
4,pop me,"Hey CT reviewer, the truth doesn't hurt as much as it does when you were dropping all those names on my feet. And such hip and cool names! Maybe you can star in School of Rock 2.This album rocks. It's from the heart, and it's ruthless and inventive. This is what real artists were up to while the Stones were busy cribbing from Gram Parsons and passing out in chateau hallways."
3,Decent camera for the price,The camera is cheap and the picture quality is decent for daytime but lowlight its very poor. I know you can't expect much for this price. It is a decent covert camera although I would have asked they not put a screw at the bottom of the unit so its seen anytime this is placed higher than eye level which most if not all the time it would be. The silver screw stands out and very much cheapens the unit. Easy to install and yes this has to be hard wired.
2,Disappointing,I was expecting a lot more out of this book. It scratched the surface of a huge topic without enough content.
5,A MUST-HAVE for the environmental-minded,"I bought this book after seeing a review in Newsweek. It's the best $11 dollars I've ever spent on a book! Despite the wealth of information already prevalent on the internet, I have not been able to stop turning to it as a reference guide since. All the topics are well-researched, up-to-date, and are outlined in a simple, easy-to-read format. I love how practical the book is... at the end of every chapter are websites and other ""green"" resources relating to the chapter topic as practical ways of starting changes in our ways of living. If you have watched Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and are aching to begin a healthier way of living, then do your self and your family a favor and read this book!"
4,Amazing,This book is amazing. My professor suggested this book and it has changed my life. I only shop organic. I have learned that when you shop at farmer's markets you save a ton of money. I go to Trader Joe's for everything else. I am currently making my home more eco-friendly. This book even changed the way I allocate my money for my retirement. This book is awesome!!!
5,Great Practical Get Started Book,"This book is really a great get started check list with enough details to be helpful and get people on the right track. It makes a great gift as it is an easy read and is not too preachy or overwrought. As with everything else, you can not write a book that covers this much material and have detailed information on each subject. It does help you target the places you feel you can be greener without much effort and give you a course of action that may require more research on more complicated things like systems for your home. This would be a great read for middle school & high school students as part of Earth Week."
5,Good Audie Murphy movie,"Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier of World War II. Surprisingly, after the war he became an actor in Hollywood, mostly in westerns. Although Murphy was not a great actor, he became a quite competent one. The Guns of Fort Petticoat has Murphy's character helping a group of women who are in serious danger from an Indian attack cleverly and successfully defend themselves. This is not a great movie, but it s a good western for Audie Murphy fans -- like me."
1,CD. Disapoints,"I have loved this music, since the 80s On vinyl. Of course. My favorite trac. The little fete, is. inaudible..on my BOSE...at the highest volume. That Cd. Is trash. A bad burn."
4,"Post-""Beauborg"" Vangelis","Before this album, Vangelis handed ""Beauborg"" over to RCA, an album that everyone figures was intended as a contractual obligation piece. Then he skipped to Polydor with this return to form, picking up back where he'd left off with ""Albedo 0.39"" and ""Spiral"", but adding for this project a good bit of orientalisms in keeping with the theme. Of the Vangelis projects I'm familiar with, this is perhaps one of the most ""New Age""-ish of the lot, along with ""Ignacio"". Still, there's a lot of the soundtrack/dramatic elements present in these compositions, and like his immediate pre-""Beauborg"" albums, this provides some pleasant and enjoyable listening with an exotic coloration. But it's not one of his peaks, I think; for those, you'll need to check out ""Heaven and Hell"" and the ""Bladerunner"" soundtrack."
4,As earliest Vangelis's job..,"In this album, he shows us his earliest digital sounds.And he tried to show us China, mysterious world. But his imformation to China was short. As a result, his music was very nice, but the symbolising of China was't.For example,The Long March dosen't symbolise pains of the people.But his music was very beatiful to listen."
5,SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL!,"This album is atmospheric, romantic, inspiring, dynamic, just plain genius!1979 was THE year of punk and to think that music like CHINA was being produced at this time makes me laugh! It just spat in the face of all that contrived, hypocritical, image concious, attention seeking noise.China is one man's vision of a mystical culture. This is reflected in the music with intelligence, passion and supreme musicianship.It just exudes oriental charm and sensitivity. I have known many people with very differing musical tastes find this album refreshing and inspiring.BUY IT, NOW!"
5,After 8 years I listen to this CD weekly,"Of all the new stuff out there, this CD is still among the best. Van is very powerful on this Cd and the music is very potent and powerful"
4,My favorite,"The Vangelis album I listen to most in my collection and the one I recommend to people, in general. More indirectly inspired by China than the title suggests.It's interesting that two of the tracks were used in commercials in the Eighties: one for a Linoln-Mercury Cougar auto ad and another for that early Channel #5 spot (the one with the guy diving into the pool...). Some good organic-sounding stuff for fans of music synthesis, too."
4,"A Good Sequel, But Not There Best.....","I bought this album because of the songs that are sung by the Bee Gees. My favorite songs are ""Woman In You"" and ""Breakout"" which show there wonderful harmonies. There is at least 5 bee gees songs on this album which is great. The rest of the album is just filler to me. If you are a big bee gees fan sure buy this album if you want to hear something new. I'm not a big Frank Stallone fan or Cynthia Rhodes fan they just fall flat to me. Happy listening."
2,average,"it's not Saturday night Fever part 2.very average.the Bee Gees only really get right on ""The Woman In You"" but it is Frank Stallone that has the song.""Far From Over"".that is the best sing on this set.but overall 2nd tier material."
3,Great,When I watched the Movie ther were Two songs I just had to have. So it was right up my alley when I found this Sountrack for the movie. with the 2 trcks that I've always wanted. I'm happy and relaxed.
4,Beautiful songs,"I like this album very much even though there were just a half of Bee Gees' songs in that album. The melody of ""Someone belonging to someone"", ""Woman in you"" are so beautiful. I strongly recomend Bee Gees' fan should have this CD as your collection of Bee Gees."
2,The power and the gory,"I didn't know that this would be the Gospel According to MacArthur. Was hoping more for an historical perspective on crucifixion. This book would be great for someone searching for an uplifing slant (no pun intented). Simply put, it was just too religious for my tastes."
4,"Solid, Biblical exposition","I love studying MacArthur's books. He doesn't write terribly well, but he is thorough and insighful. This is one of his better books. It's a study of the crucifixion - written well before the movie The Passion of the Christ and so obviously not written to capitalize on the film, as other books on this topic seem to be. He focuses on how God displayed His sovereignty through the events of the crucifixion. Very, very well done."
4,wonderful fragrance,"I have always loved this fragrance. I stopped buying it because of the cost. But a couple of weeks ago, I orderedthe eau de toilette. I should have spent a little more and purchased the perfume. The toilette is nice but it doesnot stand up like perfume does. I am saving penneys so I can order the perfume."
4,Satire with a capital S,"Death by Zamboni by David David Katzman is satire with a capital S. There is no subtlety here. It is in your face. Parts made me cringe, parts made me laugh out loud. Zany, witty, gross. As inA Greater Monster, the creative use of the English language is worth the price of the ticket alone."
5,My favorite adventure series of all...,"I read this book shortly after it was first released (I was in high school). If I could take one adventure series with me to a desert island--this would be it. I love aviation, I love technothrillers, and love good sets of characters. This book delivers all of the above. Set in the aftermath of WWIII, the character Hawk Hunter is the hero whom the series centers--and he is a patriotic, adventurous, and and very likeable character who takes on the impossible. The story is very fast moving and will keep you wanting more. The surrounding characters are as equally interesting as the plot itself. I hope this series has a very long life. Mack Maloney is a guru of adventure!"
5,"Wingman is amazing, and this is from a woman!","I LOVE this book. It's action filled, is suspensful, kinda like an edge of your seat movie in book form. Maloney is suprub in this book and the 14 books that follows Hawk Hunter. I have all but 2 of the 15 books, they're in order right now and waiting to come in. If a person loves action they'll love this book, it's perfectly made for a movie! Mack are you listening? (hint hint)"
5,A Fast paced page turner,"One of the best books I have ever read. Yet buyer beware, after this book you'll have to read the next in the series, and then the next, and then... I think you get the picture."
3,"A fun read, but...","thats only if you can get past a few things about the book. First off, the main character, Hawk ""Hawker"" Hunter is a Gary Stu. There's no getting around it, he's so perfect that his only flaw is that he's too loyal and patriotic. The second major flaw is that the book plays very loose with certain aircraft details, the biggest I've found being the B-52's weight capacity, which was overstated by something like 8-10x. If you can ignore those two points, you'll find this to be an entertaining read."
4,A fun and enjoyable 80s style military romp,This is a perfect yarn for someone who loves a Tom Clancy novel or any sort of high powered guns blaring action novel. You'll blaze through the novel in a few hours and just enjoy it as you would a good action movie.
5,Good at its job,"It is very easy to use. It has 4 speed control. Super Low which just barely moves the air, low moves the air little more, medium and high. I am glad I bought it."
2,works but poor design and construction,"I purchased two of these Hunter switches for existing ceiling fans. They work and control the fan as intended but the design made the installations problematic. The switch is big... fitting it into a wire crowded electrical box was difficult... and in one case impossible.The frame of the switch has an attached ground wire placed next to, and on the same plane as, the lower mounting screw cut-out... making it impossible for one side of the installed switch to lay flat against the box. One of these installations replaced a similar switch from Leviton. Because the Leviton is slightly smaller, it fit into the box which would not accommodate the Hunter switch, it lays flat and was much easier to install. the Leviton also seems to be of better quality and will be my replacement switch when the time comes.Edited to note that replacement time came within two weeks of the installation when the plastic connector on the Hunter switch broke."
1,look elsewhere -- cheap....,"I have 4 of these installed by my builder. 2 have broken knobs -- they simply break too easily. Please look elsewhere now, or you'll be looking elsewhere later after you break the knob in 4 months.Also -- like another reviewer stated, the L1 setting is reallllllllllly slow, and has no useful purpose."
1,get some glue,It worked first time placing it in but the real work came to precisely lift the light or the fan knob up/down. I also liked the built it plastic knobs that easily pop off and its find waldo time to get it from the floor if you noticed it popping out. If you do glue be sure just lightly do it or its one giant mess....but the glue wont hold these plastic pieces down as they will come off again and again....its adventure built right in.
1,Hunter 27181 Four-Speed Slide Fan Control,"Truly a sorry control.Buy anything but this. Low speed barely moves, high speed is high, if you go to a lower speed it might stop."
2,cheap switch,The switch operated very well for about 2 weeks and then the slider broke off. I would not reccomend this switch at all. The slider needs to be thicker.
3,not bad,"This is a collection of nice, rather original tales. I especially liked those about brownies. However, in my opinion Russian folk tales are really the best."
4,poor ending,"thiz movie was kinda a change in story for me. im used ta scary horror movies, and this one wanst scary ( it wasnt supposed to be) and it had a corny ending. the boy gets a chance to have a truck load of c\toys, but he chooses lunch with an ugly kid!!!"
3,Language,"Cadbury enjoys the use of foreign words. It can make this particular work exceptionally difficult to read. I found it to be a distraction to the information that he intended to pass on.This is a focus on the more human aspects of Luke-Acts. It represents an in-depth look at only the man-made elements and if that is the goal for study, then it will be a good resource."
3,"Cute, not practical for us",We have carpet so I bought this to go under the high chair. It was too hard to move chair around on it. Easy to clean if you pick it up after every meal. We ended up buying a mat that is supposed to go under a computer chair. More expensive but easier to clean and looks nicer.
4,A good translation . . .,"M. L. West's translation of Hesiod's ""Theogony Works and Days"" is very readable and enjoyable if one likes Hesiod. Some of Hesiod's writing is cryptic because he tends to use poetic descriptions and to mention or refer to topics not included in his work, but the West edition includes a decent set of notes to assist the reader. The notes are not exhaustive but suffices in aiding the reader to comprehend the discussion. The translation is written in prose and well-written, but I gave the book FOUR STARS only because I prefer verse translations. The book is otherwise a very good one. (A verse translation that I enjoyed is by Richard S. Caldwell.)"
4,"Review of Hesiod and Theognis, Penguin Classics","The translation is readable and its endnotes extensive. Personally, I prefer footnotes, but I have no complaints about the notes themselves. The translation of Theogony is a bit dry, and Work and Days a bit better (although the translator argues this is Hesiod himself growing in quality as a poet). The poems do not rhyme.The Elegies of Theognis are perhaps the greatest asset of this edition. When I ordered the book, I had no idea who Theognis was, but the translation is so well-done that the poetry is most memorable. Some of these poems (the translator's favorites) are in rhyming verse."
5,Excellent Translation,"I found Wender's translation to be both readable and pleasing. Although Hesiod and Theognis are not necessarily related by their views, they do have a similarity. That being that they are perhaps more densly populated with great short quotable statements than any other works in literature. The one criticism that I would agree with is that it would have been nice for the notes to be turned into footnotes. They are very useful and looking to the back of the book constantly is a bit tedious. Still, it's a small price to pay when reading such excellent works."
5,12 years later and still relevant,"I got this book as a complete introduction to Java and programming almost a year ago. This book assumes literally NO knowledge of programming or computers in general. It does a very good job of teaching the basics and it is a very easy book to read. The programming projects at the end of every chapter really do a great job at driving home what you learned in the chapter. The only complaint I have is that some (only a few) of the programming projects are a little too hard. Also, the chapter on files isn't really useful anymore, but every other chapter is still (for the most part) up to date.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to begin programming with Java, or who has programming experience and wants to learn Java."
2,Manufacturer misrepresents product,"The heating element inside the pad is much, much smaller than the pad. It does not heat the entire pad nor is it weight activated as stated by the manufacturer. The heat simply does not quickly dissipate when an animal is lying on top of the heated area. The small heated area. My cats do happily use them every day though. Their favorite is a mat I purchased two years ago, from the same manufacturer, with a heater that fills the entire pad. I bought that mat on sale for less than the cost of these newer, smaller mats with the tiny heater. I'd give this more recent purchase a three rating, even a four, for the warmth and comfort provided since my cats are not offended by the manufacturer's deceptive advertising. After making a complaint I decided to keep the mats. It was not worth my time, effort or return postage to send them back. For misleading buyers a one or zero would be appropriate. Average it out for a two star rating."
2,too much useless information,"This book has tons of information in it if you are writing a detailed report on the background, history and subtypes of bettas. It has a great deal about wild bettas and types of bettas. It wasn't until over half-way through the book that it actually told me information on keeping the betta splenden as a pet, and then it went back to the history lesson again.The information that he provided about food types for Bettas was the most helpful part in the whole book."
1,Irrelevant Information for Actual Betta CARE,"I bought this book for my sister as we've been bitten by the ""betta bug"" and I decided to take a peek before giving it to her. It says right on the cover it would have information on maintaining the aquarium, food, breeding, and health. However, a majority of the book was just about different species and their natural habitat, breeding, and genetics. There were a few pages dedicated to food but nothing about maintaining or setting up a tank. He says in the introduction that bettas are hardy and will eat and live anywhere, with no requirements for water parameters or heat. Not what I was looking for and I will probably return it and get my sister something else."
4,"""The Betta Handbook""","This book offers a detailed description of many Betta species, not just our favorite Betta splendins. The book cites were the many Betta species were first identified in Southeast Asia including the habitat. This book makes you apreciate the many Betta fish species and how adaptive they are. There is a significant amount in this book regarding Betta splendins color genetics and gidance on breeding. I gave this book a four rating because relative to other hard-copy and e-books there is less information on the care of the Betta fish. Also, the book is somewhat outdate being published in 2004. However, for those wanting to learn about the orgin of the Betta fish and the many varities fo Bettas, this is the book for you."
2,Pretty useless,"I bought this book hoping to learn the basics of how to keep my bettas healthy and happy. I learned little of what I need to actually know. Unfortunately, there's very little relevant information about required water parameters, daily feeding, and temperament of bettas. The first twenty pages or so goes on and on about genetics and breeding, as if that's relevant to most people who keep the fish as a pet. The most informative part was about what to feed my fish, but unless you want to harvest mosquito larvae or cultivate your own brine shrimp, let me give you a tip: feed your bettas bloodworms and brine shrimp you get from the pet store, and skip this book."
5,Great Fun,"The Garza boys are amazing, and this book gives a great insight into Henry Garza's technique and style. I read some of the reviews that said the tab wasn't complete - I don't know what the reviewers mean by that. You will want to have some experience reading tab - there's a lot to wade through if you don't understand music very well. There is a system with standard notation, a system for the lead tab, and a system for the rhythm tab. In other words, on most pages you have three stacked systems. If you're going to play it by tab as it's written you need two guitarists. It's all there - if you're on your own you just need to pick whether you want to do the rhythm or the lead tab. You can certainly combine both for a good sound, too - adding some lead riffs here and there into the rhythm. At any rate, guitarists who appreciate tab will find this book lots of fun!"
1,Awfully sick,"This book is a waste of money - it claims to be by eddie vedder - the fist page is written by him - the rest is ""sick"" pictures of another band. Waste of money"
2,Captures a certain era - to a degree ...,"I was there - in Seattle - in the 80s - in that scene... The book does capture some of the mood and the angst of the times, however, once you glance through the book, your done. No desire to pick it up again. Get 'Grunge"" instead; More evocative shots of the key musicians of the time. You will want to keep that one handy just to walk down memory alley once in awhile..."
3,Worth it for the racing scenes,"Although this isn't one of the best series I've seen, since it's so cheap it's worth it just for the racing scenes (which admittadly are few and far between). The story is average, the non-racing animation isn't that great, and Takumi's friend Iggy is just plain annoying (especially in the dub). Don't look for too much action, there's a lot of re-hashing the same scenes over and over, but with all that said I'd still recommend it. The small part of the series that actually is racing is amazing!"
4,Lots of Synthesizers!,"When I purchased the CD, I didn't realize how old of a recording it was. I will buy another Eloy CD, if not ALL of them. I wish they were a little longer but back in those days, the CD's were much shorter. The vocals could have been better but the music is wonderful. Having 2 keyboardists is a plus for this recording. It you like synthesizers, it is a great CD to purchase."
5,"The first ""punks""","They are never reconized for it, but The Stooges were really the first punk band, no, not The Pistols, The Ramones, or The Damned, but The Stooges. This came out in 69 were as most of the early punk came out around 77. This album, IS raw power (another good Stooges album), this cd has great songs like No Fun (Pistols did a great cover of this) and I want to be your dog... If you want to have the true roots of punk, get this."
4,THIS is how Detroit rock SHOULD be,"Okay, it's not perfect at all. Why not? For one, there's the infamous We Will Fall, a ten-minute disaster that is unlistenable, endless, and void of any merits whatsoever. Harsh, but true. Anne isn't much either, a psychedelic ballad with Iggy attempting amusing-yet-annoying Jim Morrison-esque vocals. But the rest is excellent. I Wanna Be Your Dog is the most familiar track, having been covered by virtually every self-respecting punk band. Not coincidentally, it's the best thing the group ever recorded - Iggy's maniac vocals; a burning, brutal riff and a driving rhythm come together to make this one of the best sex anthems ever. No Fun is another classic song, and justly so. The group rocks out, and it's funny. Same with 1969, another keeper with a great wah-wah solo and hilarious lyrics. Meanwhile, the lesser-known Real Cool Time is - wait for it - real cool. Okay, there are a couple duds. But this is a great debut from the original punk band."
5,An all time punk classic.....,"If your one of those people who didnt know that punk existed prior to the ramones untill now, then the first thing to do is to get ""Kick out the jams"" by MC5. The next thing you must do is buy this impressive debut from the stooges. MC5 were louder, angrier and politically minded, but the stooges made better music.There is only one bad song on this album...yep, its the much hated ""we will fall"". The rest is pure gold. The best here is really 1969 and no fun, but its all good. As hard as it might be to believe, this is not their best album! Fun House and Raw power are both better than this, but that doesnt mean that this isnt a masterpiece, because it is."
1,This mix sucks!,"I agree with everything the other reviewer said. The Cale Mixes are messed up bad! You will notice the way the alternate vocal version of I Wanna Be Your Dog on Disc 2 comes to an abrput end at approx. 3:26? On the 2005 remastered version it fades out. What gives?Also, where is the alternate vocal version of Real Cool Time that appeared on the 2005 set? The ""takes 1+2"" version on RCT is just the instrumental track. Does anyone have an explanation?"
5,This is the real deal!,"For anyone who digs the real DETROIT sound and wants more of that Asheton guitar work, check out the CD ""Thin, Slim & None"" by The Empty Set and Ron Asheton. The CD features studio and live cuts and captures the essence of the Detroit experience."
4,Why We Exist,"This is nihilism as we should all know when we are 17--and should listen to afterward. Buy it, you of too much faith."
3,"Not good enough for four, too influential for two","Iggy and the Stooges' album is an ok album. Don't be discouraged, we can expect better from this band. The next two albums FUN HOUSE and RAW POWER are supposed to be better than this though I do not own them. I am a large punk fan apart from these guys I like MC5, the New York Dolls, Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Ramones, the Damned, the Dead Boys, and many other amazing punk bands.The problem is though every song but 'We Will Fall' and 'Ann' is somewhat notable, only '1969', 'No Fun', and maybe 'Little Doll' are songs fit to set punk standards.Iggy Stooge (later to be called Iggy Pop)-VocalsRon Asheton-GuitarDave Alexander-BassScott Asheton-Drums"
1,Don't buy.,"Well I bought one, lasted a year or 2. I figure for $40 thats what I get. So I'm about to sell the vehicle and want something cheap to throw in it again so I buy another one and low and behold the thing only lasts 2 weeks this time.So now I need ANOTHER one just to sell the truck and am going to be out another $40 at least. Sweet.I'm going to try out the ""Professional Products 10700"" to see how well it goes since it has no reviews anywhere. So go look at that product instead of this trash and see if there are any positive reviews yet."
1,Biggest automotive POS EVER!!!,I've gone through 2 of these pumps in 6 months; the first one lasted maybe 2 weeks...... I'm going to look at Facet or Airtex brands.
1,Don't buy,Don't buy this pump it only lasted about 1 hour and quit. I will be returning it and buying a higher rated pump
1,Failed in a few months,"I bought 2 of this fuel pumps. One is this 12S and one is 42S. Both of them failed in a few months. I used it pump fuel for 5 minutes per day on my work. Therefore, it is not very reliable. One of them I have to hit is a few times before it start pumping now and one is totally dead."
5,Dont use for Diesel!,"I always laugh when i see that huge disclaimer on the packaging. Like the sky is going to fall or something if you get it near diesel.I dont know why its there as i have been using these pumps for the last 8 or so years, and only in a 100% diesel environment. This is to include all the way from 100% bio-diesel, 100% SVO and 100% #2 diesel and mixtures of all three in a dizzying array of quantities.One word of caution though. Ditch the joke of a filter that the pump comes with, and place this pump after a real fuel filter. You'll be amazed the garbage floating in your tank, the stock ""filter"" will clog easily and you'll choke off your fuel supply. If you put it after a 10 micron filter, you'll have no problem for years and years.You'll also want to mount the pump on some sort of rubber isolators, cause if you just slap it on your fender liner the noise will get old in a hurry."
2,Stick People Would Like It,"I received this book as a Christmas gift because it was recommeded by a relative. I have found it helpful because of the basic instructions, but only in conjuction with other knitting books that I own. I have not made any of the sweaters because they are all for people that must not only be stick people, but also quite short. If you are of normal size, forget about it...."
3,Not all it is cracked up to be,There are a few mistakes in this book and you have to be sure to visit their website for the corrections. I was expecting some of the designs to be real contemporary and exciting. There are a lot of sweaters and you can basically find the patterns in other books that offer more variety. I do like that they focus on large needles and chunky yarns. It gives a beginning knitter quick satisfaction.
2,"Cute patterns, but...","I picked up this book while looking for a new knitting book. I'm pissed at myself that I didn't look closer at it, because the patterns are basically useless for me. The patterns are very cute, but the fact that they are knitted in bulky yarns is a big turnoff. I get the feeling that if any woman wore sweaters from this book made from bulky yarns that they would end up wearing a fat suit. Not good."
2,sort of ugly sweaters,"I was pretty excited about this book when I got it, and I made two sweaters from it... but they both turned out kind of cropped and wide. I think it requires a little more adjusting and thinking than ""simple knits"" implies. I still have hope that their sweaters could be cute, with a little modification. Also, they only suggest really expensive yarn, so you might want to substitute."
5,My first knitting book,"I am brand new to knitting, this is my first book. I just checked it out from the library last week and I'm already halfway done with a sweater. The first few pages of instruction were very easy to follow. It's filled with a lot of easy patterns for trendy clothes and accessories. Each pattern has a large color picture of the final product and tips to get you through. There is also a website listed on the back flap ... that takes you directly to the yarn girls company so you can buy the exact yarn suggested for each pattern. It's a great first book. I came back today to buy it."
2,Not bad but could be better,"This book does have some very basic, approachable patterns but as one other reader mentioned, the hooded sweatshirt pattern is incomplete. I am also having trouble achieving the gauge with the yarns recommended even after trying different needles. Also, the little story with the V-Neck sweater is obnoxious --- it was made to show off the store owner's ""washboard abs.""On the plus side, they do give row-by-row instructions for shaping armholes and necks and they do have schematics for the sweaters which is very helpful. Yes, the yarns they recommend are pricey but I do think good yarn goes a long way to making a knitting project a success."
3,Frustrated Newish Knitter,"This book has patterns that looked simple enough for someone who had made more than my fair share of scarves and wanted a challenge. While the patterns look cute and very wearable to someone in their 20's I have the following complaints:1. The yarn is incredibly expensive.2. The instructions are not very clear, the illustrations are even more unclear, and several basic techniques are left out.3. All the materials required for each project are not all listed in the materials section at the start of each project.4. Even with the correct gauge I have had to purchase extra yarn to complete projects.I'd recommend that a beginner find another book to explain basic techniques, but I still think the patterns are cute enough to suffer through the rest of the book's shortcomings."
3,"Cute projects, but a word of warning:","Although there are stylish, simple projects in this book, the sizes tend to run much smaller than normal. The size small of the easy buttoned cardigan measures only 18 inches long, which must be a size 0-2. A beginner would not necessarily realize this; experts could make their own adjustments, but the book is written for those who have a bit less experience."
2,"pictures, please!","i checked this book out of the library because i thought it might have some hip, new knitting patterns. unfortunately, i can't tell what half of the finished designs actually look like because the photographs are so bad. one sweater is shown hanging on a clothesline and most of the others are photographed on dress forms and cropped so that only half of the sweater is visible! i'd like to know what these clothes look like on real people before i put the time into making them."
2,Not-so-simple,"I am an intermediate knitter, and I had a lot of trouble with this book. First, many of the patterns are just not that appealing. They're quite bulky -- and while thicker yarns do knit up quickly, they're not so attractive on anyone larger than a beanpole. While I'm fairly small (size 6), I do have a chest and cannot imagine wearing such bulky garments.Second, I found the yarn selections hard to substitute because of the way they were almost all used double. And the yarns suggested were quite expensive.All in all, I resold my book on Amazon after holding on to it for about six months. I just never was that interested in knitting anything in it. I like the kids' book much better, and am looking forward to the ""Beyond the Basics"" book."
2,Yarn Girls Guide To Simple Knits,I found this book disappointing. I bought it because it had been well reviewed and I thought the younger styles would appeal to my 14 year old daughter. The pattern I did was the hooded sweater. The picture was cute but the pattern is incomplete. There was no info on finishing the hood. No directions for the drawstring or casing. This is not good in a book for beginners especially one as expensive as this. Also found the authors' attitude insulting to the history of knitting ie. the comments on your grandmothers kniting in the intro.They act like they invented knitting.
4,Somewhat of a beginner/somewhat lazy,I go tthis book because I wanted to learn how to read patterns. I figured if I stuck with a bunch of patterns out of one book then I would get the hang of it. I just finished my first sweater from the book (4th sweater total) and it did knit up small. I can barely get my head through the turtle neck and I am a pixie of a girl. I don't EVER use the recomended yarn (that is no fun to me) and I knit tight so this could be the issue. I did wish this book (or any) really gave pic ad instructions for stitching up the sweaters. I will try another make a bigger size. I did complete it by MYSELF without running to my LYS which was my goal.
1,"Easy, Boring, Not so Sophisticated",Another in an onslaught of books aimed at the non-knitter. Patterns are dull but a good place to turn if you are JUST starting to learn how to knit.
5,Beautifully Simple,"Simple Yet beautiful, a beginner can knit these items, and they will come out perfect every time. I used variegated yarn to knit these simple sweaters and the results were breathtaking. I am basically a crocheter and I still loved this book."
4,Not intimidating,"If you are a self learner, this is the perfect book for you. It is easy to learn of you have never knit a thing in your life. Being a continual 'scarf' knitter, I wanted to venture out into something a little more daring - but have been intimidated by knitting terms, abbreviations, etc. This book did it for me. If you get started and have any questions, just call the toll free number to the New York store and a super friendly sales person will be happy to help you out. I was so impressed with the entire situation (book, customer service, etc.) - I now order all of my yarns from the yarnco.com"
5,Excellent Book for the Beginner,"This book has become my favorite knitting resource! It is an excellent reference for those beginners used to only making scarves and other such basics but lack the confidence to dare to create more challenging items like sweaters. My own knitting has improved 10 fold with the basic easy to understand instructions provided in this book. I have learned better ways to shape and seam my completed sweater projects (that turn out very professional looking I might add)and because of this book I have become a faster more confident knitter, completing projects in 5-7 days between the subway and evenings at home. I have already created a beautiful V-Neck sweater for my friend's daughter. This is definitely where most of my Christmas sweaters will be coming out of this year!"
3,Patterns look nice....If you're no bigger than a size 8!,"I really enjoyed the simple, straight-forward approach to these patterns, then I read a bit closer. Nearly all of the patterns do not account for a bust larger than 33""! It wouldn't be so bad if they provided instruction for how to grade the patterns up, but this book doesn't get into the nitty gritty of that, as this is a book for beginning knitters. It was so disappointing to see that the authors do not account for the ""sizable"" majority of the reading public when constructing the patterns here."
5,"Knit, Knit and more Knitting",I really enjoyed this guide book because as a knitter who sometimes needs a little help I can look back and find everything I need to know right there. Also this book has a lot of great patterns that really wouldn't go out of date soon. The patterns are also very easy to follow.
3,Patterns all the same.,"I have been knitting for about 6 years now, and I purchase books mainly for their patterns and not necessarily their Learn To Knit instructions. As for the patterns in this book, I found them all easy to follow and knit, but pretty much all the same. In this I mean, the garments all look the same minus a turtleneck, sleeve (tanktop version), long torso instead of short torso, etc.A friend of mine is borrowed the book to learn how to knit. It covered the basics for her just fine. She said that the illustrations were helpful."
2,U S Book Distributors Directory-no great deals yet!,"I.'ve been through about half the book from front to back and haven't found a good deal yet. At least not at the prices some of my comeptetors on Amazon.com can sell their books for. The best deal I've found is a comapnay that offers 45% off regualr list prices, but you have to spend $500 minimum order. That's a lot of books to sell, and the discount isn't that great."
3,Totally dated---too sixties!!!,"I'm trying to plow through this story but it isn't easy! I find it too dated especially when describing Sara's appearance and the way she and Bruce treat Ruth and Pat. I got this book on the basis of all the good reviews but I didn't find it spellbinding at all! In fact, I might not even finish this tedious work."
2,Not one I would typically recommend.,"I bought this book based on reader reviews, and I can't believe how dissappointed I was! The story itself was interesting enough, but the writing just didn't pull at my emotions at all. Perhaps it made a better TV movie, but the read was nothing special. I don't even think it was the fact that it was released in 1968 because after all, a classic transcends time. This book is far from classic. I can only guess that those who love it have maintained a smaller spectrum as basis for comparison. I however will continue my quest to find the perfect novel that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up!"
2,ammie come home,I was dissappointed by this book. I thought it was a bit draggy at times and could not wait to get through it.
2,Used book - Really used!,"I knew that I was buying a used book, but I didn't expect it to be a used library book with the lables cut off. It was no less money than others listed... Really beat up."
4,Ammie Come Home,"Like several other reviewers of this book, I first read ""Ammie"" in the Reader's Digest Condensed Book format. I devoured it! I recently picked up my own copy and haven't changed my positive opinion of this book one bit. It has a little of everything for every reader as it is a ghost story, a mystery, and a romance all rolled into one. Barbara Michaels tells an excellent story and the reader will easily become familiar with her characters, as if they are old friends. Highly recommended!"
5,"Ammie, come home",One of my favorite authors and she never fails to deliver a good story. This one was no exception with likable characters and an unusual plat..
3,Very Dated,"This is the second time I've read ""Ammie, Come Home"". I have to say I found it very boring this time around, and very dated. I believe it was written in 1968, and it has not aged very well. The story, if it had been developed better, is a good tale of Revolutionary War-era murder, madness, ghosts and possession, but the thrust of the ghost story takes a back seat to the endless, often dull, conversations of the four main characters, who can never seem to converse without getting into some sort of phony confrontation. They always seem annoyed and petulant. Do yourselves a favor and check out the film version, entitled ""The House That Would Not Die"" starring Barbara Stanwyck--a great scary movie for a rainy Saturday night."
1,False advertising -- not jasmine,"This hand cream contains no jasmine! It says jasmine on the front, then says in the description on the back that it's jasmine, but there is NO JASMINE in the ingredients, and it of course has no jasmine scent whatsoever."
5,The Perfect Combination,"Whenever these two musicians get together, magic happens. Jon Anderson's wonderful voice and lyrics were made to go with Vangelis' incredible music. From the first notes of Italian Song to the last of Horizon this album shines with a positive and uplifting brilliance. Jon Anderson is so flexible that he can move from the large band sound of Yes to a more intimate and personal sound as on Private Collection with no problem. Horizon is an incredible epic that really makes you feel that perhaps there is a spark of hope in this world where ""no reason seems to exist."" If you love Jon Anderson, you will adore this album. He and Vangelis work very well together. I also strongly suggest you try their other three albums, Page of Life, The Friends of Mr. Cairo, and Short Stories."
2,Buy for Italian Song,"If the entire album was as good as the Italian song, it would be a 5 plus star rating. That song is brilliant. The rest of the album is very lackluster in comparison. If you are looking for a great Jon and Vangelis album, Page of Life would be my choice. If you have never heard Italian song...download it or buy this disk...it is that good."
5,The Little Twins DVD,"The is one of the most WONDERFUL shows we own for our kids and they absolutely love it. Gentle stories with nice values to learn. A must have for your DVD kids collection.The stories are about a sister and brother, who are twins and also little gnomes! They go on adventures together, solve problems and just have fun together."
3,Ok - but something was missing -,"Seducing Sir Oliver by Nicole Byrd was sweet historical love story with a dash of mystery. Julian goes to London and finds herself staying with Lady Sealey who someone is trying to kill. Julian becomes mixed up in solving the mystery with handsome blushing Sir Oliver. Sir Oliver is not your normal historial romance character, he is shy and collects wild animals which cause havoc. It was a nice Sunday read - but something was missing. I hated the cover ! If you are looking for some great historical novels check out The Lady Lies by Samantha Saxon, The Naked Duke by Sally Mackenzie and Daring the Duke by Anne Mallory"
4,review,this tubelight is good. you would need 2 of these in one room to make it appropriately bright though...
1,Not good for reading light,I found the light very disturbing for my eyes. I now only like Full spectrum white lights. I recommend it highly.Also u can pick this GE light at Walllllmart for $9. (here it killed me for $33)
2,"Fine, as long as they last, but 5 months sucks!","Less than 5 months ago, I bought 2, GE 12257 Bright sticks to replace the two I bought the year before. Those previous two had died. The first of the last two purchased last April (now September) has also died. Perhaps, I should start looking for some alternative."
5,"My Opinion of 'It won't happen to me""","I think that this is a great book for young teenagers to read in school because it deals with all sorts of teens who ended up doing something that which and everyone of them regret, or would have chose to do it in another way. It shows how the mothers and fathers have to live, and what they have to sacrifice with becoming pregnant, and the choices of whether or not to keep the child. If they end up keeping the child, then they have to go through so much more than what regular teens would have to go through in a normal situation. This book is rated a thumbs up in my opinion."
4,Action AND Acting,"I loved it!Although Reversal is a film that's focused on more than wrestling -- it doesn't leave you wanting for mat action.Great cinematography, too."
3,The best movie ever about amateur wrestling,"I thought this was the best movie I have ever seen about amateur wrestling. It shows both the good and the bad of the sport. It takes on the obsessive values and delves into the eating disorders that are almost encouraged. It also is a story about family and love.This is a small independant film. Most of the actors from what I have read are not professional actors and it sometimes shows. It is based on a true story. The amateur wrestling is very real and done really well.This movie has been recommended by amateur wrestling champions like Kurt Angle, Cael Sanderson and the great Danny Hodge."
2,Disappointed,"I would not reccomend this movie to students. I thought it was supposed to be a family movie. The language and sexual themes were unnecessary. It could have been such a great film without those things. The convenience store part where the kid is buying trojans is pitiful. The part where Shaw is talking about them sleeping together is unecessary. Just a few things and it would have been so great. Now I can't show it to my wrestling team. As I was watching the video, my thoughts were to destroy it, because I find it unsuitable for any audience."
3,a little too much,"After a while it starts to get on my nerves...maybe a song or too is fun, but like the Ramones there is little depth."
4,Verrrry good album,"I've listened to this album a few times and I always felt like Matt reminded me of another artist. I finally realized that he sounds like a male version of Aimee Mann, IMHO. So if you like her, chances are you'll like Aqualung."
2,Fragile,"Initially a great watch, exactly what I was looking for.In the entire year that I owned it not a problem... and then I dropped it. I was putting it on my wrist so it fell from a height of 3-4 feet and landed on its face. I didn't notice at first but the next time I checked the time it was off because the seconds hand had fallend off the center and was just floating around inside, blocking the other hands from moving.Real nice, a tactical watch that can't handle a 4 foot fall. Don't bother with this one."
1,unbelievable leaky POS,"i've owned hundreds of watches of every sort, but this a first. i bought this watch to swim in as it is rated as a 200 meter water resistant watch and the inside of the crystal is fogged after the first time in the pool. my 10 dollar casio that is minimally water resistant has been in both the pool and the ocean many times without issue. this is a pretty disgraceful product. it was very cheap for its spec, so i took a chance that it would work out. nope!btw, it's a wonder a company like smith & wesson would tarnish itself by having their name put on something like this"
3,Entertaining,"I wonder why there are no reviews or Kirkus reviews on this book.Written in 1974, it is the story of a man and his land, inherited from his father. He has 2 younger brothers who work with him and hang in throughtout the book. He, Jim, marries Peggy and they produce one and then another baby. There is a mystery with Duncan who came to live with them some years ago, is a wonderful person, but has a shsde hanging over him which is not solved until the end. Peggy has problems and Phoebe enters the picture. things work out in the end and I would not read it again. Sorry, AT"
4,Enseñando a Leer,"El libro ademas de una tecnica de estudio, nos enseña que forzar el aprendizaje, castigar a los niños, los periodos largos de estudio y cosas por el estilo NO ayudan a aprender, sino motivan el desgano y desinteres del niño para leer."
4,Top side up !,"Tim Buckley was evidently blessed with an amazing voice and great songwriting talents - even able to explore quite diverse musical areas. This album has always been my favourite, because of the atmosphere and the jazzy feel. I'm not entirely convinced by the second half of this record but the first half especially is very, very good and very, very satisfying. Adorable ! You just gotta love this man !Hans Wigman."
4,Happy But Sad... I also noticed somethin'....,"It's a good album. Quite in par with Van Morrison's Astral Weeks but not as stunning. However, I observed the melody of STRANGE FEELIN'. Has nobody yet noticed that it has almost the same melody with that of Miles Davis' composition ALL BLUES from the critically acclaimed KIND OF BLUE album? I did notice upon the initial play of STRANGE FEELIN'. Anyways, Tim Buckley is worth the try as well as his son Jeff."
5,Good Music,"By buying this CD, I have recovered music that I used to listen to when I was 18. Great stuff!"
4,Nero Corleone,"Cute cat story, delivered on time and inexpensively. I enjoy all kinds of cat stories, and this one was different from others I have read since it was set in Italy and Germany."
2,Wrong size.,"The knob I received is a good deal larger than what it looks like on the website. It's a beautiful part but unfortunately it doesn't fit my 2nd generation Mazda MX-6. (The mounting hole of the knob has a larger diameter than the stick in my car so it can't be securely attached.)I wish this website had copied the label on the package reading ""Fits Mustang""."
1,signal enhancer,This signal enhancer did not seem to to much for us and so I was diappointed. I had hoped it would give just a bit of a boost so we would have a better signal here in rural Missouri.
2,Signal Enhancer,It is what they advertised. Can say it enhanced my cell signal any. Slow delivery time.
1,Timing correction.,"Though the disc lists a playing time of 42 minutes, it is actually longer. You just can't hear it."
2,ugh,"well, the playing here is first rate... as are some parts of the composition... but, i have to agree with a previous reviewer that a lot of this could be done away with - the loud brass is just a waste - who needs it? yes, a bit like mahler, i.e. a bit like the worst, most over-rated composer ever - some good bits put between a bunch of crap - like peanut butter and jelly?"
4,"An unknown author, an obscure press, a splendid novel!","This first novel is the work of Frank Gaspar who grew up in the '50's in Provincetown, Massachusetts in the midst of the Portuguese-American culture there. He looks back on that ethnic phenomenon with total recall and perfect pitch. This novel is so good, so true to its amazing cast of characters, that it is a sheer pleasure to read. Not suprising since the author has had three powerful books of poetry in this setting published, all of them prize winners for clarity and quality. If you remember William Saroyan, if you found The Perfect Storm and The Hungry Ocean interesting you will like this novel. The buzz is starting. Who knows ? It might even hit the best seller lists!"
5,An AMERICAN story,"""Leaving Pico"" is more than just the coming of age story of a young, second generation Portuguese immigrant boy. It is a desperately needed fresh look at the story of America. No judgement call here. Just the real inside stuff that can't be found on a map. The heart of this country and what makes her swagger. Displaced characters, fully realized in the author's capable hands, trying to catch a toe hold on some reason to raise their heads up when they are well beyond down. And surviving, growing more confident with each generation, learning the new tricks for adaptation. Yes folks, the AMERICAN novel IS alive and lives without shame in this amazing first novel by this poetic American voice. Buy it, read it, and put your name on it before you lend it out!"
4,Leaving Pico,"Only because I was raised there and grew up in that end of town I knew the people he was referring to (even though names were changed) I knew his family. I maybe wrong, but I don't think it would have held the attention of another reader for long..It was a great time and town to be raised in and the way he wrote about the people caring and life style was ""right on"" It was an era of time that I was grateful to grow up in. Family was everything....and neighbors were extended family. That's the way it was....We are of the same ethnic back ground, for me it was a step back in time that no longer exists there. It brought back many memories. Thanks for letting me express myself."
1,Overpriced and Under-serviced,This backing pad was very expensive and wore out after only a few uses. I have always had good luck ordering items through Amazon but this one was a total lemon!
2,late receipt,"received item several weeks beyond when I expected it. company claims fault was with USPS. once they were made aware of the problem, they did ship the item ordered."
2,Tights,They ripped within and hour of putting them on! They were cute but after that first half hour started to unravel.
5,Austen Andrews does it again,"The second book in Austen Andrews The Technocrat War trilogy. The same comments I made for the first apply here. Fantastic dialogue, likeable characters, engaging story.I give this book 5 out of 5 stars for the same reason as the first book."
1,don't waste your time,"This book has obviously not been updated in years. Many of the answers are inaccurate, so you are not sure if you are understanding the concept or if the book is wrong. Additionally, the author did not take the time to do the research to make sure all of the information is correct. Please, please do not waste your time or money buying this book."
2,Not Worth Buying,"When I was studying for the DAT, I bought this book for extra practice and for clarification on topics which I felt the Kaplan course was weak on. However, I found the text to be dry and unhelpful, and occasionally incorrect! Although the book comes with some sample exams, there are no explanations for the answers.The only useful part of this book the section on the PAT. The hints are mediocre, but the plentitude of sample problems is good practice for the real thing.In retrospect, I would not have purchased this book and might have gone with one of the computerized packets which are now available. The Kaplan course offered several computerized tests which were very helpful for the real thing!FYI... Academic: 24, PAT: 21."
2,NOT GREAT,"i still did not take the DAT, i had postponed it numerous times becuase i just don't feel ready. this book is horrible.. so i had to take a kaplan course and now going to do TOP score. this book is too general. i read this book in one weekend and learned nothing"
3,Review from a Returning Student,"I am a returning student and have been out of college for some time. This book is not an adequate review for returning students. The review sections are very basic. I would reccommend getting the Schaums outlines for Biology and Chemistry instead. However, the PAT section of this book is very good. It is well worth the cost just for this section of the book. I would also reccommend getting the Top Score CD for a more adequate representation of the DAT. If your wondering how I did, I made a 20 on the Academic Average and an 18 on the PAT. Not bad for someone who hasn't looked at a textbook in 3 years."
2,poor investment,"This book wasn't worth the money. The PAT was good, but it isn't the same on paper as it is on a screen. Also they use two punches in the DAT not one. The other sections seemed poorly put together. The outlines were helpful, but not worth the money."
1,Poor Proof Reading,"I have been going through this book and recently took a practice test. I was incredibly frustrated to find out that there are numerous mistakes in their answer keys. There were several answers that I knew for a fact were correct and upon checking my answers to information in recent text books, I was indeed correct and the answer key was not. It is very annoying to pay money for a test preparation tool just to find out that they did not take the time to double check everything. The information contained in the book before the practice tests is helpful, especially the PAT section, but don't waste your time with the tests unless you want to look up every answer to verify whether or not your answer is correct. Stick with Kaplan or other big name test preparation books."
2,Do NOT recommend Barron's,"I have this Barron's review book for DAT. It is filled with errors and mistakes. The review lecture contains materials that are not only misleading but sometimes contradict most current edition of organic chemistry textbook (ex. read the Sn1 and Sn1 solvent). Even the practice test are filled with wrong answer and incomplete explanation. The diagrams are often incorrectly illustrated, especially in the PAT section. Chances are that you will end up missing more points because of the wrong information in this book. I would recommend Kaplan's prep material instead. Final advise: don't waste your money for this cheap book!"
3,Good PAT and pre-dent advice,"The best part of this book is definitely the PAT. It offers a lot of strategies and has more practice problems than other books I looked at. I also like the section they have in the beginning of the book for pre-dents, which offers advice on things like recommendation letters and interviews.The concerns that I have with this book are that I've seen the many complaints about mistakes in the answer key, and I can't tell whether I really got a question wrong or if it's a typo. Also, the math and science sections aren't sufficient. I wish that Barron's would update this, too, because it was published about 10 years ago, and I'd like to have most up to date study material possible."
3,A Closer Look at Barron's,"I am using this book in conjunction with the Kaplan review book to study for the DAT. The information is good, but the book does lack a CD Rom practice test, which I feel is necessary to properly prepare for the test. It is a great complement to other review materials, but I don't think it would work as well alone."
1,A complete waste of money,"I dont know who Barrons got to edit the information and practice test answers in this book, but I could have done a better job!! The answers to many of the practice test questions were completely wrong and some review sections could be misleading. Save your time and money and dont buy this book"
2,The PAT section is the only good section,"...according to the author at www.dentalschooladmission.com-Michael, Pre-dent"
4,"Introductory book to QM, if you are not a novice.","I read this book as an undergraduate student in engineering physics. It can be considered an introduction to Quantum Mechanics even though it is a challenging book to read. It is very mathematical, stringent, and thorough, as well as broad, and it includes a chapter on the historical origins of quantum theory. However, for the novice, I would recommend this book as ""a second stepping stone"" after reading a ""true first introductory text"" like ""Quantum Physics"" by ""Robert Eisberg, and Robert Resnick"", but that all depends on whether you know something about Quantum Mechanics beforehand, as well as your mathematical background.I found Chapter 6 ""Operators and Eigenfunctions"" to be particularly interesting. The operator formalism in Quantum Mechanics is a powerful tool, and I think the author should have introduced this earlier on and used it more."
4,Works as advertized,The battery was a bit difficult to install. Directions virtually useless. But since it is basically a simple device it does work as advertised and I would buy it again.
3,Good for Class,"It is very informative and clearly written. But if I didn't need to buy or read it for a class, I wouldn't have. An excellent textbook, but not exactly leisurely reading."
4,Fundamentals of Litigation for Paralegals,[...]Very helpful and usefull in my studies to become a paralegal. Will be a resource for me to look back on if needed.
5,a great interpretation of Schubert's Winterreise,"Hans Hotter's 1943 recording of Schubert's Winterreise stands as one of the greatest performances of this monumental work. Hotter, better renowned as a Wagnerian bass baritone, scales his voice down for this Schubert song cycle. He was 34 years of age when DG taped this version. Hotter's voice is ideally suited to the darkness and sadness of Wilhelm Muller's poems and he easily held my attention over the long time span of the composition.Hotter is ably partnered by Michael Raucheisen, one of the finest accompanists of his generation. The very acceptable sound on this Music and Arts is clear and undistorted. It must be noted that the voice is better reproduced than the piano. There is some minor surface noise but this is easily tolerated. Of the many Winterreise versions that I have heard, I place this one at the top of the list."
1,Video X is a rip off,"The description of the video made me to believe it the actual raw footage of a crimal spree, which got me interested in the first place. I was really disappointed to find out it was a wanna be ""Blair Witch Project"" with a lot bad acting. I wish I could sue the maker for misleading us to believe this stuff was real. I'd rather watch ""The Bachelor"" for reality entertaiment."
1,Blair Witch wannabe...without the fine acting.,"The two five-star reviews have to be from someone directly involved with this movie (perhaps the two ""co-stars""?) because by no stretch of anyone's imagination does this come close to five stars. Only reason I gave it one was there was no option for zero stars.Blair Witch was at least an original concept.There's more ""real life"" drama in an episode of Jerry Springer. Or if it's true crime stories you're after, watch an episode of COPS."
1,Horrible Rip Off,Very disappointing to have a cover claim to be soemthing then it turns out to be flat lies. Lousy film & lousy ethics.
2,Blair Witch meets Natural Born Killers.,"If you buy this dvd expecting to see a real crime spree, you'll be sorely disappointed. However, if you're looking to be entertained and shocked, Video X has its moments and keeps you riveted. However, it's a little bloodless and the backwoods country folk cliches are almost laughable at times."
4,Fake? Yes. But believable nonetheless...,"I picked up this movie at the library of all places (as rentals are free) and could tell that, despite Vanguard's claim that this is real footage, it was fake. Unlike Blair Witch, however, it was believable. Some reviewers mentioned that the two didn't have a charger or spare tapes, but if you pay attention, at one point Dwayne mentions that he doesn't want to keep having to charge the batteries, and it's possible to put 101 minutes onto 1 tape. Be that as it may, during the final scene, the end result is predictable yet shocking. I found myself wanting more after the film was over, which I can't say for a lot of the so-called ""blockbusters"" that have been released recently. The creators, however, should have done a little more research into the handgun used, because at one point too many shots were fired without Dwayne reloading, but that's a minor point. Still, overall, it was well done and good for an emotional rollercoaster."
3,I Had a Feeling....,"At first, I believed it was real...until it came time for their sad little sex act and the bath scene. She(Darla Jean) was supposed to be underage and they showed her breasts...can we say Child Porn Laws??..Either way, it was kinda entertaining, nevertheless."
4,Love True Crime,"I love true crime and love reality TV. Video X is the sum of what can happen when pop culture and it's glorification of money and violence is exposed to people of lesser intelligence. This couple watched too much MTV and tried to get it for themselves. I felt like a voyeur and found myself drawn into their nightmare as the film went on. I even was sympathetic at times and can see how a crime spree can happen. There is so much to it I watched it a second time. This video is sweet, sad and above all shocking."
1,Can't beleive that some people think this is REAL!!!!!!,If you watched this DVD and beleived that it was real than you should feel like a real sucker! The acting in this movie should be a dead giveaway but incase you somehow missed that than here is proof! During one of the scenes in which the two are driving in the car and arguing and the camera is on the seat between them pointing at the car stereo...well you can clearly see the head of a third person in the car...and this is way before they pick up the Billy guy. So you want proof....there you go!
5,Absolutely Superb,"I think it is rare to find a book in this genre as good as this one .The writing,character development,plot/story,etc.are superb.I felt as though Seth and Jim were friends whose backstory I was experiencing as they told it. I spent two sleepy days at work this week from staying up so late reading as the book was impossible to put down.I applaud Ms Shapiro,this lady can write. I am looking forward to her next novelI hope some smart producer turns this novel into a great movie."
2,How love can bore you to death,"Yikes. I gave this two stars because I felt badly that I could not make it past page 108 before I just couldn't take it anymore. A combination of a middle-aged gay man's sex fantasy and Harlequin Romance, it can really try the patience of the reader. In fact, I am a little saddened at the increasing mumber of gay novels that might have been written by Jackie Collin's little sister. Not to offend anyone - but there is and can be so much better stuff out there."
2,"good writing, awful story","I really did enjoy the writer's style. It's too bad it was wasted on such a bad story. The book started out okay, but spiraled into garbage pretty quickly. After the characters return to Drinkwater hte book pretty much became unreadable to me. It was trite, and pretty much done before."
5,Terrific Emotional Roller coaster,"This one sucks you into a wonderful emotional roller coaster with élan and humor. Very sexy, too, whatever your preference in gender."
2,2 1/2 stars for a film with more style than substance,"Radha Mitchell reminds me of Mariel Hemingway in 1982's ""Personal Best"". She not only looks remarkably like her, but exudes that innocent, yet sexy persona. Also, like Hemingway's character, Syd (Mitchell) begins to dabble in homosexuality. I never saw this movie before, but it always had my interest because it was a big change for Ali Sheedy playing a very butch photographer. It is also the first movie directed (and written) by Lisa Cholodenko who had great success recently with ""The Kids Are All Right"". Unfortunately, the movie is more style than substance. Aided by the terrific Patricia Clarkson as a drugged out German actress, this is another example of the actors being better than the material. It isn't a bad movie, just a boring one. Cholodenko holds back on the hot and sexy when it's most needed and generally leaves the viewer flat."
2,Patricia Clarkson is why you sit through it,"WHAT, for heavens sake, is Rhada Mitchell doing in this film -- and why? As a mousy editor of a preeminent, cutting edge, photography magazine? The masses may buy the idea, but it doesn't fly with reality. Ally Sheedy did an interesting job of looking bored and wasted, but I did not for one second believe she was a lesbian and her pawing attempts at portraying homo erotica were laughable. Thumbs way up to Tammy Grimes: when she was in front of the camera (as little though it may have been), she ruled the scene. The absolutely phenomenal actor in this dreary and bleak story was Patricia Clarkson -- her portrayal of a drug addict high for most of the film was too real for comfort. She, and she alone, is the reason to watch this ultimately empty story of human decay."
4,"Interesting, entertaining","Heroin sheek and high camp revolving around a briliant photographer everyone wants to work with, sleep with, be with in any way they can manage. Ally Sheedy was great. Add my thumb to the other two thumbs up!"
5,EXCELLENT !!!,"This film catches Ally Sheedy at her Best. She is so Brilliant as Lucy. The role just seemed to fit Ally perfectly. Radha Mitchell is so young and vibrant playing opposite her. A very wise choice of cast to play off of each other so easily. Cinematically speaking the entire film was just full of visual treats for the artistic mind to enjoy. Ally Sheedy is such a Professional and Natural Performer. She was born to play this role. I just wish she was more involved with either the Independent or even Mainstream Film industries, so that we can enjoy more of her Great Acting abilities...I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who loves a ""One-of-a-Kind"" performance.."
2,Low Art,"First off, Mitchell and Sheedy gave incredible performances. Both were so natural (Sheedy was always my favorite Brat Packer) and I never doubted for an instant these were real people, not just stock junkie lesbian characters. My problem was with the screenplay. I could almost feel the director's elbow in my ribs, poking me at every ""shocking"" scene. Everyone wallows in the excess, and it eventually brings the entire film down. I finally did not care about these people, and the final twist ending was more expected than new."
3,ally sheedy is sure a good looking boy,"an interesting look at aging artists living a decade too late in the era of ""rent"", but it sells out in its final minutes with the too predictable demise of the ally sheedy character. ive always liked ally; shes one of those girls who looks like a teenage boy."
2,budget,of all the movies i have seen in this catergory this movie was dissapointing to me. poor acting and hard to understand dialoge. would get a refund if you were in australia. but it is too much hassle to poste back overseas. and it could get lost in the mail.debra
1,A silly juvenile film. A pseudointellectual piece of nonsense.,Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people. But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day. The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the pathway for Marxism). The film appeals to naive youth.
3,High Art answers burning questions,"Syd (Radha Mitchell), an editor at an art magazine, befriends her photographer neighbor Lucy (Ally Sheedy), and a relationship ensues. If you've ever wondered what happened to Allison Reynolds after her Breakfast Club detention, I'm sorry to tell you she grew up to be a lesbian heroin addict. This movie has a few shining moments (most of which involve Patricia Clarkson as the tragically beautiful girlfriend) and will make you think about life and your place in it. -Cynthia Gunnells, CeleGAYtions"
5,Fantastic!! a must have...!!,"One fantastic and real movie.I am not going to explain the content of the film since the previous reviewers did an excellent job; I must only say that this film is essential in your DVD collection and it will be in your thoughts for a long time.Far away from a Hollywood Love movie, this film captures the essence of the relationships based in opportunities, ambition and manipulation. Which brings the question, what will you do for getting what you want?."
4,About 3 Lebians....but much more,"I caught this movie years ago on cable and came across it again on Amazon. It's about 2 woman who are slightly older and in a same sex relashonship. The downstairs ""teenager"" who I belive was bicurious, starts falling the older woman/artist and a working relashonship draws them together. Ofcoarse the partner of the lesbian woman and oh yeah did I mention the boyfriend of the ""teenager"" doesnt really like it. Sex, drugs, and love? are apart of this movie, check it out."
2,High Art -- disappointing,"I really didn't get this movie. The entire cast could have been reduced down to three people. All the druggies hanging around Ally Sheedy's character could have been removed from the movie and no one would notice the difference. The person you think is going to die at the end of the movie (due to a drug overdose) doesn't. And, the person you think isn't going to die (due to a drug overdose) does. That's pretty much the story line."
3,"Mixed review: original and compelling, but...","Some of the time this movie dips pretty far into darkness. Yes, ""artists"" are known to have all kinds of eccentricities. The revolting extent of ""Greta's"" drug abuse drags us away from the relationship between the main characters - even though it was important to show the power she had over Ally Sheedy's character. I do think that the depiction of all the drugs and apparent lack of real employment is annoying, but, it is often the reality of artists lifestyles. It also draws into focus the vulnerabilty of drug users, and how helpless and enslaved they become. The attraction between the two main women characters is gritty, but finally tender and believable. Even with the idea that they have found love, and potential success together, drugs win. Absolutely worth watching, a good discussion piece."
5,Still one of the best of the 80's,"I recently picked up The Crossing as a digitally remastered CD containing additional tracks beyond the original release. It was years since I had this album, and quite honestly, I had forgotten how remarkable it is. Big Country's debut is infectious, energizing, affective, and unique. These guys wrote and performed with all the energy and sincerity of soul, making the music on The Crossing both powerful and captivating. I was very pleased to discover that the additional tracks that have been added to this remastered CD are just as compelling as the originals. The Crossing continues to be one of my very favorite albums from the 80's, one of those rare albums that I enjoy as much (or even more) today as I did ""back in the day."""
1,A Textbook Example of the Worst Kind of Remastering.,"Add this reviewer to the list of Big Country fans who agree that the 2002 Remaster is compressed to the point of being totally unacceptable. In the name of making it loud, every nuance has been squashed right out of the mix. Avoid it."
1,Was better before the remaster,"I bought this album on vinyl in 1983, and later a cassette copy to listen to in my car. More recently I copied the vinyl to a CD. When I discovered this remastered version, I decided to buy a copy and I expected a much improved listening experience. Sadly that is not the case. As others have pointed out in their reviews here, this remastered version is very bass heavy and the vocals now sound like they're in the background. Listen to the song samples here and then compare them with the samples on the page for the un-remastered original album CD and I think you'll agree..... They should have left it alone, or found a more competent sound engineer. Seek out the original version!"
5,Buy this.,"A fantastic, underrated rock album. Some of the best vocals and lead guitar riffs I've ever heard on record, and their influence can be found in many modern acts. Fans of U2, Bloc Party, Maximo Park will be pleased. Absolutely essential."
4,Big Country--Good,"I loved Big Country in the 80's and now i have them on DVD. They are refreshing--you can feel the history and angst in their music. Can't listen to it over and over--your head will explode, but they are great."
5,A New Wave Classic,"Though Big Country like most of the new wave/synth pop movement of the 80's was a one hit wonder, it was quite an addicting hit. With the new wave revival coming around with bands like The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, and Modest Mouse, it's fun to go back to the 80's when it was the hottest thing around. This album contains the 1983 hit from them ""Big Country""."
5,One of the best albums of all time,"I saw the group the first time on Countdown (An Australian Music Show) with ""In A Big Country"" and automatically love them. A short time later I bought ""The Crossing"". I listened to it over and over and each time it just got better. The bagpipe guitars just blew me away as I have never heard any other band try this concept. Every song on the album is fantastic and this album is a definate to every music lovers collection."
4,Worth the Wait!,"Big Country's The Crossing was that album I wanted as a kid but never bought. I am glad I finally did. Simply, its a great rock album. Fields of Fire is great, just as great as I remember from years back. For anyone who ever thought of buying it, do so."
5,One of the most influential and defining albums of the 80s,"The Crossing is one of the most influential and defining albums of the 80s. The guitars speak for themselves in this album. Includes the instant classic ""In a Big Country"". Adamson and company delivered a work of art with this CD.This CD also includes the songs from the Wonderland EP as bonus tracks (on the same CD) after the original Crossing songs.Highly recommended!"
3,meh,"Pretty expensive in my opinion. The package is just as it looks in the picture. But if you want to have an orange scent, just use orange peels and save $..."
5,Too useful,"Terrific collection of illustrations of food, utensils, spices and more! Borders too. Perfect for use with group cookbooks, holiday letters, etc. Just finished Thanksgiving themed letters, used cornucopia graphic. Like the other books in the series (books & reading, animals, Egyptian designs, Indian designs, etc.) you can run them off the CD-ROM without installing them on your hard drive. Collect 'em all kids!"
5,impressive,"I wasn't so big on Take Me Home. But The Wait, three years to be exact, is worth it. This album is better written AND produced. The group sounds cleaner. The arrangement builds and falls in a unique way, structurally different than the typical rock band. The instrumental sections draw as many ears as the catchy chorus hooks. Zox uses a wide range of styles, from folky violin melodies to hard rock jams, helping me separate each song from the next The lead singer has a powerful voice. At his highpoints I can really feel the emotion (*Carolyn *Can't Look Down). Not to mention, the melody and counterpoint of the album create memorable jingles in your head. Well worth the investment. I wish Zox the best of luck promoting this album, spreading the wealth around the nation, and into a major labels hands."
5,zox.. YEAH!,"well.. the first ZOX show i went to was this past summer. it was a BRU show at station park and it was the first time i'd ever heard of ZOX, besides a few kids at my summercamp mentioning them. since then, zox has been one of my favorite bands. they have a sound unlike any other band, and ""the wait"" is definately a great album. all in all, you should really buy this cd, it will CHANGE YOUR LIFE.. not really, but it is pretty awesome to listen to."
5,All you need if you have a basement sump well in your house,"Just got this little venturi, put it on the wash sink in the basement, which has a faucet that is threaded for a hose. Then hooked a full length garden hose to the side port and stuck the other end in the sump well, in the other corner of the basement.Turn on the faucet, you create enough suction to raise water a few vertical feet through all that hose, believe it or not!A lot easier than bailing the sump, if the power goes out."
4,Wow That Was Fast!,The pump got here really fast! I ordered it on Monday evening and it arrived on Friday morning. I had to order a replacement for my other one that broke but it was 3 years old and had a lot of use. The pump works great but the threads on the white piece that connects to the faucet can be easily stripped and is the reason I only gave it 4 stars. I upgraded to a metal one that I found at Home Depot and it works great. Other than that you will have no issues with this product. It is simple to use and it will assist you with draining a 55 gallon fish tank in as little as 10-15 minutes.
1,Miss Leading and Deceptive Advertising Photo,"The picture depicting the product made it look like you would be receiving the hose with the super pump, as I was in need of a hose, being the primary reason I ordered this product. I only received the super pump unlike the photo depicts the product to be. It appears to be quite deceptive and extremely misleading the way the picture was displayed."
5,Great,Used this cable to connect my Ipod to my PC. Works like a charm. Does the job quick and efficient. Who knows I'll be liking the apple products after all.
4,Excellent Lesbian/Gay Movie,This movie is highly entertaining. I don't know what else to say about it. It is about a quirky character and I thought she was delightful. It's not really about an intense romance.Canadian. Keep that in mind!
1,Ugh,"reading all the wonderful reviews, i had high hopes for this movie.Result: utterly disappointed. waste of time and money."
1,Horrible - artistic tripe,This movie is horrible. I can't understand why anyone would like this pathetic artistic tripe.
5,At last!,"I have waited years for this to come out on DVD. One of my favourite films of all time (if not my favourite), I've only had a very poor copy I taped from the television years ago. When it was first shown at the Cannes film festival, the critics gave it a standing ovation (totally unheard of). A beautiful story, wonderfully acted and filmed. A truly magical experience, so why did we have to wait for so long? - second hand tapes have been changing hands for quite large sums, so its obvious there was a demand for it.Slightly mysterious, but very grounded, the story is touching in many ways. The basics are spelt out in the other reviews below, so I won't repeat them. But I will repeat my praises for it- this is a MUST HAVE independant Canadian film, rarely seen at the Cinema anywhere, and surely one of the best films missed by most people.BUY IT NOW."
5,Very nice shoe.,"I loved the shoe, but I ordered the wrong size and I found another that I liked better. It is a very well made shoe, quality leather, nice fit."
5,STATS Lights up the Scoreboard Again,"Filled with insight and a dab of humor as only the analysts at Stats can do, Baseball Scoreboard offers so much more than the annuals that merely list player and team statistics. I have read the previous 6 editions of Scoreboard and this one is the best ever -- answering those important questions and pointing out the most fascinating information of the historic 1999 season. An essential read for any student of the game and an entertaining read for even the most casual fan."
4,"it roxxxxx, man","what can i say mannn. My eardrums are blown outt. Still got my Heep poster on tha wall. Had it since I was 12. I'm 45 now and still livin in the same bedroom I grew up in, in my parents house. I help out with the wash. Thats OK cause I got the Heepsters to keep me company. I listen to this album every day mann. It roxxxx! As long as I got Heep starin down at me from that wall, I'll be doin fine. Later!"
4,Before the Metal Became Too Heavy,"Demons & Wizards is one of the two best Uriah Heep albums because it manages to be engaging without losing any of the intensity that Heep were capable of. Ken Hensley was the heart of this band, and his compositions, while simplistic, manage to create small worlds. An artifact of its time, D & W is fun to listen to."
3,SOlid output,"SOlid release by Heep, a band that always produced a lot of somewhat ""slicky"" records. DEMONS & WIZARDS was their great breakthrough, but the band slowly went into numeral members changes (more than 30 - yes, thirty!!) musicians passed through their rankings in their long career, when MIck Box assumed control (like Iommi did in Black Sabbath). DEMONS was their fourth album, released in 1972, and displayed some foolish fantasy lyrics, but a general great sound. The singer, David Byron, is simple amazing, altough his voice can be a little bit annoying sometimes."
3,Mixed feeling but all ok in the end,"When I received my shipment it was in good timing, but wrong product. I am buying as xmas gift so no big deal. was easy to return and receive proper item. Thank you!"
4,Very good Uriah Heep album,"This is the first band that I ever loved, I was eight years old when my brother won ""Uriah Heep Live"" in a contest on radio. I was listening to this album every day. The first album I bought was ""The magician's Birthday"" and a friend of mine, also eight years old, bought ""Demons and Wizards"". We both still enjoy listening those two albums, they are among the best from the band. In my opinion, these two albums have the most beautiful cover art ever made ! ""The Wizard"", ""Circle of Hands"" and ""Paradise"" are pretty good songs. Did somebody, like me, ever saw that ""Circle of Hands"" is based on the same chords than ""In the court of the Crimson King"" from King Crimson? Even if I know these two songs since a very long time, I didn't notice this very recently..."
2,One of signs of the Death of Rock & Roll,"The absolute worse record of the seventies, but, in spite of that every metal head throws this up as a classic...Save your money....Give up on this one.....Belongs in the heap of ""What the hell was I smoking ?"" when i liked this. Really,really lousy stuff.......See for yourself....just dont, buy this junk.............."
4,Great memories from my childhood,"I purchased this book out of pure nostalgia and I was not disappointed. The illustrations of are as dark and entertaining as I remember them with grinning skeletal specters, a haunted house cross-section, and a cyclopean phantom dog. It's a visual feast that offers bite-sized information on a very broad category of ghostly subjects, such as history, ghosts from different countries, explanations, and fakes. Great for little kids. My only complaint is that this book is hair thin. I'd kill to have a copy of the Usborne Guide to the Supernatural. If only."
2,Not as good as the old edition,"I am really disappointed with this new edition of Beginning Russian. I needed it because I had a copy of the first edition from the library and had ordered the CDs from Cornell University to match. The CDs (which are excellent and amazingly extensive and good value) didn't match the old edition of the book, so I ordered the new book, thinking it would be roughly the same. Unfortunately, it is totally different. In the old edition, the graded conversations followed a story and kept me committed to continuing. In this new edition, the graded conversations are totally random. I don't care about the characters in them, as I don't get to know them. I know nothing about them. They have no substance, and I'm bored. I bought this book because I don't have a regular teacher or class to attend where I live, so I need the book to be very engaging, which the first edition WAS! This new ""improved"" edition is a great disappointment."
2,Weird Colors,"We got these for my husband, who is vison impaired. Though the print is large, the abnormal colors are confusing for him--and for extended family members who have played with them (they REALLY dislike these). We prefer the other kind we bought, which are red and white or black and white, over these."
4,Low Vision Bicycle Cards,"I bought these cards for my Mom who has ARMD. She loves the fact that the hearts and diamonds are different colors. It makes it much easier for her to tell the difference between the two suits. However, her friends do not like the cards. I'm hoping that they will get use to them as my Mom loves to play cards and especially bridge."
2,Romantic suspense...with espionage....,"Megan MacLeod is aboard of a cruise ship with her father's research partner's stepson, Luke Cross. Luke's mission is to keep Megan safe from her former fiance, Howard Atterbury. Howard's mission is an attempt to smuggle classified data out of the U.S from Megan's father's research lab. I personally did not care for the added espionage element of the novel. I did enjoy Megan's adventures with having her bloodhound, Ferdinand, who is also on board the cruise ship with her. I did enjoy the day Megan and Luke spent at the port of Singapore in Chapter 7 (i.e., her visit to Tangs shopping centre, lunch at the Raffles Hotel, Sago Lane). However, this book would not make my short list for a good romantic suspense."
1,Shure Master,"This Case is is not oval as indicated in the picture but small and round, and will not fit the SE series. The model number of the case for the SE530's is PA628"
5,fantastic,SURE sent me the wrong product and I called them directly explained to them that they sent me the circular case and not the oval and they shipped one overnight. Free of charge and no return
1,not the case as described,My friend just got this case but it's not the big oral one but the round one which looks really cheap.
1,Apperances can be deceiving,This product is presented as a case for the Shure E5c headphones. It is not. It is too small. The picture of the item gives the impression that it is oval in shape. It is not. It is round and small. Shure does/did have an oval shaped nylon zippered case for the E5c but this is not it. I ordered this case but was greatly disappointed with what I received. Amazon should replace the picture and correct the description so that it is accurate. I had to expend the time and money to return this item to the vendor since it was not what Amazon led me to belive I would be recieving.
2,recommended by a friend,"but i couldn't stand the smell of this, and i am reluctant to put things on my skin, that have chemicals in it...just not for me, although a friend loves it, i just gave it to someone at work"
5,Body Dew Body Mist,this is an excellent product and when used properly makes your skin feel like silk. I would recommend it to any woman who wants soft skin. It was recommended to me by friends and they weren't wrong. it's awesome!
1,Will the Chinese ghost writers and actors please stand up?,"Anyone who is aware of the history behind the 1959 Chinese takeover of Tibet and their subsequent execution of 1000's of monks, as well as the attempt to totally destroy the temples, writings and schools, should be able to see through this exercise in propaganda for what it is. The Chinese government's fear of the Buddhists and the power of the Buddhist philosophy is reflected in this feeble attempt to disparage Buddhism and its practitioners. It should be obvious to Amazon. I am not asking that Amazon not provide the film, but an accurate description of what it is and why it is propaganda would be useful in the description."
2,Israel: A Journey Through Victimization,"A politically correct documentary of a people potrayed as victims, complete with Liberal consensus views on man made global warming contributing to biblical end time prophecy. Their is no biblical focus on the fact that mans inhumanity toward mankind in general is caused by mans sinful nature, and his enmity toward God. Man is responsible for all the misery of this world, but a loving God has provided a means for repairing our relationship with Him through the sacrifice of Christ Jesus. There is no explanation as to how cultures destroy themselves by turning away from God and biblical truth. The Jewish story is not one hopelessness as it is portrayed in this documentary. In the end God will fullfill His promises toward His choosen people and all believers in Christ Jesus.This documentary is a onesided Liberal view focusing on a victim-hood ideaology. It does a horrible injustice to all those seeking truth from a biblical world perspective."
3,adequate monsters,"As a collection of stories, this one is adequate. The stories themselves are realistic but seem to be taken from a small unrepresentative portion of society as there are a lot of important teen issues that don't even garner a mention. What is included is well written, but as someone who has worked with teens in crisis for years, I was disappointed that there wasn't more to this book than there was."
2,"Good, but not the best","I like REM's music. I really do. I grew up listening to them on the radio. But there's nothing new or ""best"" about this album, except for the fact that it includes a few new never-before heard tracks. And how did those new songs merit ""great"" status, anyway? I bought this CD in order to listen to songs that have already proved their weight, not to listen to anything new.In addition, ""Bad Day"" sounds suspiciously like ""Its the End of the World as We Know It.""One good thing about this album, however: I was pleased to note that ""Stand,"" ""Man on the Moon,"" and ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"" made the play list."
4,REM is my favorite old-time band,"I started liking this band when I was a kid, and I still love it now. I saw them perform one time, and Michael Stipe just blew me away. If you like REM, get this CD and just sink into it."
3,Best of Pet Peeve,"I hate ""Best of"" CD's that include previously unreleased material (new) at the expense of what I am buying the CD for; material that has already proven itself (only once was the new material worthy: Olivia Newton John)! To decide that these new songs deserve hit status at the expense of earlier material has always seemed an affront to the listener. This CD is no exception! Songs that made the Band popular and enabled them to have a ""Best of "" collection in the first place are missing. Since my budget for new material has shrunk with rising music prices, I have been dropping new albums by older groups who appear to be condescending in their selection of what ""I"" should recognize as their hits. Save your Money, if your already a Fan, then you have the good stuff, if your not your missing way too much on this one."
3,Good but missing a lot,"I see a lot of complaints about this CD not having their early hits. Read that title of the CD folks, it says 1988-2003, there is another CD that covers the pre 1988 hits.This should've been a double CD, but not in the way the ""Special Edition"" is, cause it is missing a lot of 'hits' and I really wonder about some of the song selections. I have seen articles with Michael Stipe and he said that he chose the songs for it and he intentionally left out songs like 'Shiny Happy People' cause he hates it now. But, the lack of representation for the better songs from Monster is disappointing such as Strange Currencies."
3,Useable item v. hassle of returns,"The CD arrived and appeared to be a manufacturer irregular. It was like two discs glued together so it was too fat to play in my player. When I pried the two apart, I realized that that's exactly what had happened--two cd's were glued together. Because of the glue, one wasn't playable. The other could only read some of the tracks. I bought the disc for two songs, so I kept in only because the return process would have taken too much effort."
4,The best of a great band,"While I feel that this album misses some great songs, no one is going to agree on a definitive ""best of"" from a band that has put out so many albums. And I do emphasize ""best of."" This is not a greatest hits album, since most radio stations have ignored REM in the past few years, and they haven't had many hits in the U.S. For those who miss ""Fall on Me"" and ""It's the End of the World,"" remember that this is 1988-2003, and those earlier songs can be found on Eponymous, their IRS collection. For those who say there are too many new songs, there are (I think) about 2 songs per album, plus three additions. I believe REM wants people to hear what they're proud of from recent, critically acclaimed albums that very few people bothered to check out. Give it a chance-- and then check out their newer stuff."
3,A tribute to the masses (will music industry ever learn?),"Good album - although I heavily suspect recording industry for keeping an eye on commercial interests and not paying tribute to such audio highlights as Drive, Bang And Blame and last not least Shiny Happy People. Those songs definitely would have been worth being put on a ""Best Of"" album - but which song of R.E.M. wouldn't have? A probably good solution would have been to produce a double CD full of R.E.M. hit compilations instead of boring the masses with some live and acoustic rarities on a so called Special Edition."
3,R.E.M.: The Ballads,"This collection should be called ""R.E.M.: The Ballads 1988-2003."" Almost all of the selections are slow songs, and even though the songs themselves are mostly great (except for some mediocre recent material like ""The Great Beyond"" and ""All the Way to Reno""), the band comes off as wimpy balladeers when they were much, much more than that. Where's ""Bittersweet Me""? Where's ""Lotus""? If not for the inclusion of ""Orange Crush"" and ""Bad Day,"" you might think that R.E.M. just completely forgot how to rock out after they signed to Warners. Combined with the awkward track sequencing, it makes for a frustrating listen.The bonus disc includes some cool stuff, but probably not a lot that a dedicated fan hasn't heard before.All in all, these songs work much better in the context of R.E.M.'s full-length albums than on this one-dimensional assemblage. Representing all sides of R.E.M.'s music would have resulted in a stronger, more listenable compilation."
3,The Best Of R.E.M. -CD,"If you are a R.E.M. fan it has good choices. I purchased the CD for one song only.....and it did meet my expectations for the one song, R.E.M. just isn't one of my favorite groups so it didn't have a chance to get a 5 star rating from me."
3,Was not what I was thinking it was,"OK I am a fan of R.E.M.. I am just a little in a tough mood at the moment to leave a review I think,"
2,"OK album, but should be called ""best of the slow songs""","I love REM, but I guess I didn't realize which songs I was buying. This compilation of songs is pretty slow-paced, so I had hoped for a less depressing album. But again that's more my fault."
3,Volume 1?,"In light of the dismal sales of R.E.M.'s recent albums, Warner Bros. may be trying to milk as much as they can out of their $80m deal with the band, thus issuing this 'greatest hits' package that feels more like Vol. 1 of a series. So many hits are missing that it fairly screams out for a Vol. 2 counterpart, and while the more rare tracks are welcome for hardcore fans, casual listeners would rather have the radio hits they know. Alas, they may have to download those other hits, as this 'Best of' lacks many (Bang & Blame, Drive, Shiny Happy People, to name just a few). Attribute it to corporate greed, perhaps, but this ""Best of"" could have been a much stronger compilation."
3,Why it is 1988-2003,"For the person who suspected some kind of Vol. 2 conspiracy for the dates used for this album, there isn't one. After REM left IRS, the label put out Eponymous, which covered the band's career through '87. If you want It's the End of the World as We Know It or The One I Love, they're on Eponymous. Interestingly enough, the band was angry about Eponymous being put out at that time. I guess views on a Best Of change when your career is in a commercial decline, as opposed to a commercial & citical up-swing.I've loved REM since the early 80's & used to buy every REM album without hearing any of it or even contemplating whether I should, but the last 2 or 3 haven't gotten many listens by me. This album isn't all the best of REM's career, but gives you some of the better songs of recent years without having to wade through the excessively melancholy & somewhat boring albums that they've been putting out lately."
2,"Not Much ""Great"" in this Greatest Hits","I'm going to have to agree with the others who have complained about the song selection. While I don't mind having a few obscure songs on a Greatest Hits album, especially if the band doesn't have very many hits, but REM has a ton of hits that were omitted. Why?Where is ""Radio Free Europe"", ""Rockville"", ""The One I Love"", ""Fall On Me"", ""End of the World"", ""Drive"", ""Shiney Happy People""?I would definitely think that the above hits are GREATER than ""Bad Day"", ""E-Bow The Letter"", ""Animal"", ""Electrolite"" and ""All The Right Friends."" We're not talking a FEW mis-selections - there are a lot! I'm disappointed."
4,"Good, but not awesome","I waited for this CD for few months, and I finally got it. Was it worth waiting? Yes! The CD contains all of the most important R.E.M. songs in time 88-03. You'll find such a big hits as Man on the Moon, All the Way to Reno, Losing my Religion, Imitation of Life, The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite, fabulous Everybody Hurts and last single Bad Day (with the clip inspired by polish video). The selection of the songs is very good, there's nothing missing. But what we could expect from this band? They just can't make bad CD's. A must-have for fans, and really good item for non-fans. I recommend it."
2,You've Got To Be Kidding?!?!,"Where is ""Drive"", ""Shiny Happy People"", ""Radio Song"", ""Pop Song 89"", ""Bang and Blame"", or ""Crush With Eyeliner"" to name just a few of the missing radio hits recorded between '88-'03? Talk about an incomplete best of! Combine that with the fact that there are at least four ""duds"" in this set. Had REM had so many hits that they just didn't fit on one CD, that would be one thing. Instead of getting one great retrospective - we get one medoicre set of songs. Blah!"
1,what the hell,"Why bother making 2 versions of a best of. I preordered this cd thinking there was only 1 cd to preorder. After getting the cd i couldn't believe they would dare call this a best of at all. I never even heard of half these songs and i consider myself an R.E.M. fan. Go the extra few bucks and get the 2 disc version cuz this one is not worth it, and if i didn't throw out my box and receipt already i would have sent it back for sure.Shame on me for not looking more closely at what i was buying but shame on them for releasing this at all."
2,Shotgun Marketing,"It is Stupid to have to pay for a second disc full of junk songs in order to get ""The One I Love""."
1,Sickening,"Any true R.E.M. fan, and there aren't any post Bill Berry, will tell you what a travesty this 'collection' is. To call this a 'Best of' anything is either outright stupidity or blatant ego-stroking.If it makes the band feel better about themselves to place Stipe tripe from the last two mediocre efforts alongside classic stuff from Out of Time by all means do so, but I checked out with Bill and they should have had the personal dignity to do likewise.I'm BEGGING you guys to stop, for the love of God and all the fans like myself who try with all our might to defend how great you WERE to people who see how lousy you ARE."
1,Waaaay To Much Filler!!!,"This should have been a single CD Gr. Hits, with a secnond CD in the future called ""B"" sides. As usual, it's your typicalGr. hits CD that's NOT Gr. hits. Don't bother wasting your money.Maybe they'll come out with an ""essential"" CD in the future, and make it a real greatest hits."
2,REM's unimaginative best,"REM is one of the greatest bands ever, OK? I will never deny that. I have all of their albums and have seen them many times in concert. However, there are two kinds of REM fans. There are the ones that have been with them all along and still like listening to ""Murmur"" and ""Lifes Rich Pagent."" Then there are those fans that love ""Out of Time"" and ""Automatic For the People."" Now, i will give you that Austomatic was a great album, Out of Time was not. However, the differences between the two groups are demonstrated by a love of the early, non-commercial stuff and the mid '90s commercial stuff. The compilation is all about the mindless singles that gave REM mainstream success. Excluding ""Electrolite,"" none of these songs really needed to be included for a ""best of"" album. It was an attempt by REM to pick up a paycheck because their most recent albums were not selling well. Sad but true."
1,Best of REM '88 to '03,"I have always been a fan of REM, and this CD had a track on it that was particularly meaningful for me, as I first heard it one desperate day when I was seriously contemplating suicide. The track was ""Everybody Hurts""....and for me at that time, it said it all.The other tracks are up to the usual high standard of muscianship of this group.....in a word, AWESOME!!"
1,IT'S TIME TO QUIT!!!!,OUT OF TIME AND AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE WERE THEIR LAST 2 GOOD CD'S. ON THIS BEST OF ???ONLY 1 SONG FROM OUT OF TIME IS ON IT. EVERYTHING ELSE THEY'VE RECORDED IS GARBAGE. I USED TO LOVE THIS BAND.....PLEASE GIVE IT UP!!!!!
4,Good Collection But....,"Where is ""Drive""?, that's an WB release & received alot of airplay, also i would like to add that alot of reviewers are asking why ""it's the end of the world"" is not on this collection?Very simple, it's not a Warner Brothers release, that one is by IRS Records (Their old label).this collection only covers the Warner Brothers years."
3,Are You Kidding?You call this a collection?,"There are SO MANY MORE songs that are better than some of the songs on this album?WHY ARE THERE NEW SONGS ON THIS ALBUM?THIS SHOULD BE A HIT-ONLY ALBUM,NO NEW SONGS.Where is ""Bang and Blame?""That was one of their big hits.This is a poorly compiled collection.But if you are a true fan,get the cd."
3,"Good, but incomplete!","This Best of R.E.M. CD is pretty good and includes many of the favorites. However, it is a little disappointing because it excludes some of their best songs like ""Bittersweet Me,"" ""Drive,"" ""Pop Song 89,"" ""Shiny Happy People,"" and ""Star 69."" Also, even though many of their earlier best songs are either on the Eponymous or Document CD, it would have been nice to include a few of the very best from those two CDs like ""The One I Love,"" ""Radio Free Europe,"" ""Finest Worksong,"" and ""It's the End of the World as We Know It."" It just doesn't feel complete!"
3,Who's in charge here?,"I was puzzled when I saw the tracklist for this album. 2 tracks from ""Green"" but only 1 to represent ""Out of Time"" and ""Monster."" Some significant singles are missing. Like ""Bang and Blame,"" ""Strange Currencies,"" ""Bittersweet Me,"" and ""Drive."" (How could they not include ""Drive""?) If it were up to me, I would remove ""The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite."" I would put the two new tracks on disc 2 of the limited edition version, and fill in the spots with the above mentioned songs. This compilation is really lacking for any fan who thought a good representation of REM's last 15 years is what we were in store for. Also the sequencing is akward and doesn't sound very well thought out."
3,1 CD Best of REM? Why Bother?,"In one disk there is no way you encapsulate the best of REM. The omissions of fan favorites and radio singles and defining tracks means this hardly represents the best of REM. Even if I wasn't a hardcore fan and just wanted to hear the hits I enjoy from the group, they aren't here and thus I would pass on this. Which is what I recommend. Pick Up Best of REM import, Orange, Out of Time, Automatic for the People and Reveal instead...make your own best of. Then buy the rest."
5,Best of the best,"This is an amazing CD. Were I to compile my favourite REM songs, I wouldn't have done a better job!"
2,Best Of Should Mean Best Of,Right. The songs are from 1988 on. And why is that? Why not put all of your best songs on your greatest hits CD? This is an excuse to leave off The One I Love and End Of The World. What's left? About five good songs and thirteen boring ones. I know. REM saved some songs for volume 2. I can't imagine how lame that one will be. Hey Guys. This is why people download.
3,Yawn,I like R.E.M. I liked them in the late 80's and in the 90's. This is a good collection of hits. No more exciting than that.
5,Great!,"In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003 is the best of one of the most original bands ever!I can say with 100 percent honesty, REM are much better than the Beatles!"
3,You may tell that i only complain...but it is not complete!,"What's wrong with new compilations? on Red hot's ""Greatest hits"" there are few very important tracks missing,on REM's best of there are also these - ""Shiny happy people"",""Bang and blame"",""Crush with eyeliner"" and famous ""Drive"" - one of their most known songs.also ""Radio song"",""Near wild heaven""...too many good tracks (and they were big hits!) missed to give it more than 3 stars.everyone who want to have only 1 REM album will miss many goodies after buying.but happily new tracks are nice although ""Bad day"" is a real copy of their hit ""It's the end of the world""...)but what the hell - i like these new tracks.anyway - this compilation is half baked idea.maybe it would be better as a double cd album."
5,Really is the best of,"As a fan of rem I can really say that the best of is not used lightly. This is that cd that you can spin over and over and not get bored with it. If I could only ever own one cd, this would be it-"
3,It's tough to decide...,"...on how to rate this album. On one hand, there are so many great tracks missing from the 88-03 era of R.E.M. (Bittersweet Me, Bang and Blame, and please, at least one more from Out of Time would have helped!). On the other hand, they did include some of my favorites that I was suprised to see on this CD, such as Electrolite, At My Most Beautiful, the Great Beyond, and Nightswimming. Although these tracks may have gotten some radio airplay in their time, none were huge commercial hits. I give it 3 stars because I think some tracks could have been left out (What's the Frequency Kenneth?, The Sidewinder Sleeps tonight) to make room for the many others that this album is lacking. I'm ready for volume two."
3,about the music CD...Best of REM.........,"The music is so so only after shops in Singapore sell this album (double disc album) which could also be found on Amazon.com. These shops in Singapore are HMV Singapore and Gramophone. What I could say about the nice pieces of music they have out of the so so album are track 8 - orange crush, track 9 - imitation of life and track 12 - the sidewinder sleeps tonite. Recommeneded to those whom are interested in this genre of music.In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003Review by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kahdirector lou ye - Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace."
4,"""Pop Songs 88-03"".","It's about time we got ""In Time"". There's been roughly 8 albums since their earlier collection ""Eponymous"". This includes mostly the best, from ""Green"", right up to the new songs. The big ones are on here like ""Everybody Hurts"", ""Orange Crush"", ""What's The Frequency, Kenneth?"", and the huge ""Losing My Religion"". Plus other favorites like ""Nightswimming"", ""Electrolite"", and ""Daysleeper"". I'm suprised that ""Out Of Time"" and ""Monster"" each only have one track on here. Therefore I'm missing ""Bang and Blame"", as well as ""Drive"" and ""Pop Song 89"". But it's hard to complain with 18 tracks of ""REM's"" best. There's also the ""Limited Edition"" of this for fanatics, which comes with a second disc of extras. Whichever you choose though, it will go great with your ""Cure"" and ""U2"" collections."
3,Average - a rating of 3.5,"This was the first book that I have ever read by Nishawnda Ellis. I was able to jump into the story pretty well but the book overall was an average read. The pace seemed okay but it wasn't the page turner I thought/hoped it would be. I skipped over all of the love/sex scenes because they were way too crass for my taste in the way they were written.The surprise ending was the best part of this novel, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone I know. Not because it was horribly written, but because I only like to recommend books that I feel are ultimate page turners and for me this wasn't one. Good job though."
5,Off Da Chain!,"A definite page turner. I thought it was going to be the typical, predictable urban novel but it had some surprising scenarious near the end. It kept my attention through-out. Great read!"
5,the lives of WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS,This book was an excellent read!!The plot was great and it was well written. From the start to finish you will never suspect the ending.
4,Dogs = Men,"This was an typical read for myself involving no-good men! Some men are not satisfied regardless what kinda of woman they have. Dominic Jones is in for one hell of a ride. Dominic is married to Donna but has an affair with Tera Larou. Things a fine at the beginning, but will they remain the same? How will Donna react to the situation?"
5,Fantastic Read,"What a story. Dominic gets caught up in his web of lies when his mistress is found murdered and his wife Donna, finally sees him for the SOB that he is. Payback is a you know what. The ending will shock you! I absolutely loved the book and plan to recommend it to my friends."
1,Makes your hair oily,"I bought this product from my hair salon. The first time I used it it was alright, but then after like the third time it made my hair began to get really oily. It did make my hair reflect light...but not in a good way!! It was a gross, unwashed shiny look! Disgusting, do not buy this.. Also, its rly difficult to get the cap to open.Btw, the conditioner i use now and LOVE is matrix sleek look conditioner, its fabulous."
5,Joschka Fischer's hypocrisy,"Now, almost eight years after he and German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder ordered the first war of Germany after WWII against a sovereign country former Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer decries the war he had launched employing lies like ""Auschwitz is happening again in Yugoslavia"" as a mistake. In this book I found the hard facts which prove in a fictional trial based on real evidence how cynical Fischer and Schroeder were leading the unwilling German people into a war of aggression, fashionably marketing it as a war over ""human rights"". Also Adolf Hitler has always maintained that he had ""freed"" the people he tortured and had only shot back."
5,truth is always first victim of war,"what can we ""ordinary"" citizens do about our leaders misleading us when it comes to a colonial - kind of expension? Not listen? Hardly, but we should question the news being presented to us. This is what this fictional account of the war crimes committed by our leaders in the NATO war against Yugoslavia teaches us. Haven't Schroeder, Blair, Fischer spoken all along about ""Auschwitz"" which they wanted to prevent from happening again and used it as a reason to justify the invasion and bombing campaign against Yugoslavia? In this book, although fictional, some hard facts are introduced which if we ever had the guts to ask our leaders about would have made it impossible for them to gain public support for the war against Serbia. We should ask questions now when it comes to another ""humanitarian"" war, let's say in Sudan...."
5,Schroeder in prison? - Never!,"When reading the book I was really not sure at the beginning whether or not this could be a true scenario but I must say it is fascinating as the fiction becomes very real and one can imagine that the politicians who once attacked Yugoslavia and Afghanistan would not have any power anymore when they are in the docks like Milosevic is. After reading the book I thought, well, yes, why not put our leaders into prison for their crimes? Then again, can I imagine Schroeder, Bush and others serving life sentences? On the other hand: who ever thought that Milosevic would end up in prison? I am glad thait is only a fiction so far but it made me think about our democracies. I can only recommend the book to anyone who is eager to learn something about the background of today's world politics and their actors."
5,Loved it!,This product was great! I am very satisfied with it. The book arrived really quick and in very good conditions.
3,Disappointing,The watch is a cool watch and it kept the time well and didn't loose a second but I had mine for about a month and a few days ago I looked and the second hand was broken off. I was disappointed because I really liked it but if you want something that will hold up really well I guess in gonna have to put some cash into one.
3,Wrist Band Is Too Short,"This dive watch functions well, is easy to read and is a good deal, however the band is too short and the compass is basically worthless. I can barely squeeze it on when wearing a wetsuit and I am only an average size guy. This is a rather big design blunder in my opinion. It's like they forgot that people generally wear wetsuits when diving. Still, I am happy with the purchase, just beware if you have thick wrists."
4,Nice watch,"After my offspring disposed of my beloved Pulsar some years ago when he was a toddler I went without a waatch. I got older and tiny face with tiny numbers was not going to work for me. This watch is absolutely perfect for my needs. The one thing that would have made it it even more perfect is smaller wrist band size. This wristband would work better for someone larger then moi, but since it came with the watch I can live with it."
4,Good solid album,"She's Strange is still the cut it is so Funky&Dope.Larry Blackmon with His Cool Rap.Talkin'out the side of your neck is Bangin'.Hangin' Downtown is a Great Slow-Jam.but Love You Anyway was The Song here.Tribute to Bob Marley was cool.Cameo was Bad Back in the 80's.they along with Rick James,Roger&Zapp&Very Few Others Kept the Funk Alive in The 80's."
5,Hangin' Downtown....,"....was 'the cut'. But watchout for ""Talkin' Out the Side of Your Neck'! Overall, a verry good ol' skool CD."
2,Miserable...,I am taking a Photo class and about half the class has these tanks. They leak incessantly. Buy the Paterson tank. It costs a bit more but it will save your wardrobe.
5,GOOD BUY,"I NEED THIS BOOK FOR MY CLASS, ITS GREAT TO HAVE TO HELP IMPROVE ONES SPEAKING LANGUAGE...IT HELP ME OUT ALOT....I NEED TO STUDY MORE INTO IT.. ITS A MUST HAVE..."
3,good buy,the book came really quick but it was a little more beat up than i thought. however the pages are still intact and it was cheaperthan other sites.
4,Great starter camcorder,This camcorder is a great little camera that is easy to operate. The LCD is clear and the colors are crisp. The needed buttons are easy access. It is lightweight and fits nicely in the palm of your hand.
2,Lens Cap error after <50 hours use,"Bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error (appears like the shutter never opens) and will not record video. Spoke with JVC and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in. Will update my rating after I see what is wrong, if they can fix it, if they will stand behind their product. Watch for more details. Before it failed only complaint I had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price."
2,good for a while but then not so much,"so i have had my camcorder for a few years now, i haven't used it a whole lot but at least once a year during the summers. not until recently when i went on a cross country road trip with it that i noticed a lot of back ground noise being picked up instead of the sounds i was actually trying to record. and basically what is happening is that the motor i suspect is dying and that is all the mic is picking up so i have nice video quality with motor and fan noises instead of peoples voices. I have not yet gotten any of the errors that some people have gotten bit im sure they are to follow. and the battery life seams to drop significantly over time, i maybe get 25 mins of battery life now."
5,"Great price, great quality... service, not so good!","I'm very pleased with the quality of these glasses, definitely the real thing, this is the second pair I buy (first pair I bought at the mall) and they're identical to eachother, price is great and packaging is great as well.The only issue that I had was with the seller EzContactsUSA who took a while to ship my order, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the glasses (I will review the seller later)Bottom line is, if you're looking for a great price and you're willing to wait a few weeks to receive the glasses, you should buy them here!"
3,"Great idea, wrong venue.","The positive:This is a great product and excellent idea. I love being able to recharge this instead of buying a new one each time. Seems well built, easy to use, and easy to refill.The negative:This is not the same sound as the normal 'stadium' type air horns. This is a much higher pitch. Sounds like a boat horn, so I imagine this is more for the marina than the football game."
1,Cheap and Ineffective,"I bought this ""recharchable"" air horn because I liked the idea of being able to re-use it. In fact, on a full charge I get about 30-seconds of air, which in my opion is not nearly enuf. Don't purchase!"
5,Casey the Utterly Ageless Horse,"""Casey the Utterly Impossible Horse"" is now out of print. Too bad! Anita Feagles' book is easy yet engaging to read. It is only 80 pages (broken down into 9 chapters). Each chapter details a different scenario in the life of Casey and ""his boy"" Mike. The story is humorous and sentimental. As a young reader in the early 1960's this was my favorite story. I still have my original copy. I recommend this story highly because the character traits displayed by Casey echo the feelings and words expressed by many adolescents."
4,Wonderful childrens book,I wasn't a child who liked to read but I do remember this book. It was a fun story about a horse who was as onery as I was.This is a great book for young children who love to read about animals and their friends.My love for this book has followed me to this day. I even use casey as my chat room alias.
4,Twenty Years a-Growing,"Excellent story about an isolated area of Irish culture at the time when it was dying out as a resul of ""progress"" and changing economics. A fascinating story."
5,ARE YOU REALLY GONNA LOVE MEEEEEEEEEEEEE????,"So sings a longing Reba in what has to be one of the finest songs she has ever recorded! I can listen to that one song and never get tired. If you want to learn how to sing you should hear Reba on that song ""You Really Better Love Me After This"". Its a song that would make the hair on the back of your neck stand up!!!!! This album is worth a mind of diamonds for that song alone!! Reba if you're reading this, please, please, resurrect this song and put it in your live show! Its the most beautiful, haunting song you've ever done!!!"
4,A Final Stand for a Final Time,"Reba really did well here. This was Reba's last album with Mercury (Thank Goodness!) Mercury was actually quite detrimental to her career, it was just kind of a waste of time. She did however record some great songs here. One Good Reason, Why Do We Want are both very like her pop from today. She also has some beautiful ballads (Love Isn't Love and You Really Better Love Me After This), and some good upbeat songs (Reasons; Pins and Needles). This album has great variety, and would be a good choice for anyone. I would recommend purchasing it IF you can get your hands on it. Her Mercury albums are EXTREMELY rare, and you should buy them anytime you see them."
5,Images paired with a quick reference and health facts,"The telescope's invention and advancement let the human world in on how tiny organisms looked, and helped to reveal pathogens and their dangers: now the images of these disease-producing microbes, from viruses to fungi, are accessible to non-scientists in MICROTERRORS, a gathering of microscope color images paired with a quick reference and health facts. Clinical notes on treatment and prevention round out a unique approach."
2,A smug harangue,"I took an intense dislike to her smugness and across-the-board disdain of her clients. She seems to despise all of them, unknown as well as known. She scorns those whose homes are too clean and those whose homes are too dirty; those who won't stay to talk and those who do stay around, presumably because they don't trust her (she doesn't consider it a violation of trust to watch TV, make phone calls, have sex on their bed, and ""spy"" (her words) on them. Even other cleaners don't escape her mocking. The writing style is breezy and reads quickly. Is it a good book? It does reveal who she is, and in that way succeeds as a kind of memoir. But I wouldn't read anything by Rafkin again."
3,good clean fun,"Entertaining, and easily read in one sitting. It isn't particularly deep or meaningful, but certainly jaunty and fun. Ms. Rafkin has an eye for the absurd. She briefly mentions a book about the history of maids, and more information about that would have made the book more interesting. I liked the tips on what to do if you hire a housecleaner; that's worth the price of the book."
1,"Don't bother buying this insulting, hypocritical book.","THE OCCASIONALLY AMUSING COMMENTS ARE NOT WORTH THE INSULTING ATTITUDE THAT PERSISTS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE BOOK.The author can't be pleased: She gets hired to clean a filthy house, she complains. She gets hired to clean a pristine house, she complains. Meanwhile, she NAMES her clients and their locales when describing their shortcomings, and talks openly about her brother's drug-dealing history. She spends WAY too much time divulging other people's private information. She also believes that housekeepers' employers should bring them into the home as guests for social gatherings, an absurd presumption (who invites their mechanic, their doctor, or their plumber to their home?). No wonder she got fired from jobs after divulging clients' names and eccentricities in local newspaper columns."
1,Appalling!,"Wow! Read this book and I guarantee you will never trust any stranger to set foot in your house and ""clean"". Apparently, the actual act of housecleaning is beneath Louise Rafkin, as she feels the need to self-describe herself as an ""academic"" several times throughout the book. And, there are several references to her drug-dealing brother...um, what did this have to do with anything? Scary, disturbing, disgusting. Louise Rafkin gives this whole industry a black eye. Shame on her! The reader reviewer from Brooklyn, NY sums up the atrocities of this book perfectly..."
2,Not very curious or adventurous,"Well, they're not all that curious, and they're not all Rafkin's adventures. Either she simply didn't have enough to fill a book, or she felt the need to be ""serious"". So interspersed with anecdotes of her cleaning jobs, we are treated to interviews with ""dirty"" house cleaners, her family's former maid, and members of ""Messies Anonymous"". Not to mention an extraordinarily self-involved letter to the surviving lover of an old friend, a letter that read as though it were written with an eye to publication.Rafkin likes to clean, but she doesn't have to, and so one gets the impression, even though it may be unfair, of a dilettante. Too, although she mentions long-term clients, there's a sense that she flits from place to place. There are amusing anecdotes here, but in the end it's not a very satisfying read."
4,Do I want to have a maid?,"I thought it was very interesting how the author's described what she witnessed, and what evidence she saw of people's lives. The insight she gave into her own life and the lives of other house cleaners was also interesting and insightful. I thought the book ended a little strangely but I have learned that these types of books and their authors often end strangely."
2,"not ""adventurous"" enough","I thought this book would be more about what the subtitle described: ""A Housecleaner's Curious Adventures."" It wasn't. As someone else said, she tries to give overviews of a lot of areas at least tangentially related to cleaning -- minorities, a Japanese spiritual commune -- but jumps from one to the next without exploring any of them fully. And if you're reading it to find out the ""spy secrets"" she can supposedly figure out about her clients, you've learned all you're going to get on the cover blurbs. She knows how to write, but apparently can't decide what to write about."
1,Poor little rich girl,"This book turned out to be a bust. Thankfully, I got it used at the library resale cart. I agree with other reviewers that she couldn't seem to settle on a topic. And then, at the end, when she mentions that she OWNS a home in the Bay Area--tell me she did that with cleaning money!! Yeah, right. Sorry, honey, but there are a lot of people who actually have to do the crappy job that you were trying out. It might be ""interesting"" for you; for most, such work is thankless and unending and barely serves to put food on the table."
1,Rude and not funny,"The author is rude and crude and tries to be funny in a sort of smug way. She assumes you will laugh at her ""insights."" These are mere invasions of privacy that would make anyone with a maid or house cleaner shudder. The author thinks these invasions of privacy are funny. They aren't. Don't get this book!"
1,An unfortunate book,"Louise Rafkin seems to find nearly everyone except herself below contempt, whether it's a client or a sibling. She doesn't seem terribly fond of friends, and a potential spiritual advisor gives her ""vapid"" advice, which she fails to follow in the single test she's given. She despises people who aren't as obsessive-compulsive as she is, and shows no integrity in her work. I can't imagine that anyone would dream of hiring her to clean their homes, or write another book, after this dreadful self-aggrandizement of what must be a very sorry life devoid of trust or true intimacy. The time spent reading this book could be spent doing almost anything else; cleaning your own toilet is more amusing, and you won't feel nearly as dirty afterwards"
1,What's the point?,This book is filled with anecdotes that go nowhere and aren't funny. The stories are random and poorly written. I wasted my time.
1,Terrible. Just TERRIBLE!,"Just when I was warming to the idea of hiring someone to clean the house, I read this book and it FLAT made up my mind to never, EVER do such a thing! In all fairness, housecleaners in general are probably nothing like the nosy, critical, self-serving, not to mention LAZY Ms. Rafkin, but I shall not take the chance. What an incredible waste of time, money, and eyesight it was to read the blithering idiocy proclaimed on each page."
5,absolutely funny!,"I could hardly put it down. I think the scathing reviews in here can only be those of women or men who have never cleaned homes for a living. Lighten up folks...sheesh!! This was one of the funniest books I've ever read. Though I may not agree with Louise politically, her humor and humanity are wonderful. I have cleaned homes for 5 years. It isn't a ""hobby"" as some clients would like to think. This made for a delightful evening of laffs. Hey, Louise, when's the video coming? KUDOS, susie melkus"
5,"Witty, funny, clever","Ms. Rafkin is a very smart and funny writer. Who else could take the tedious job of house cleaning and turn it in to such an amusing tale. This book does make me think twice about my OWN house cleaner. Fortunately, Rumanian is the only language she speaks."
5,this book is satire at its best,"I loved the dry wit Ms. Rafkin brings to our dirty laundry. I've always wondered what house cleaners must think about when they are mopping up other people's mess, and now here it is. People may find the book's humor painful, but that's probably because they don't have any sense of humor about themselves (or they thought they had really cleaned up before the cleaner came!)."
3,"After reading it, I was possessed by a sudden urge to clean.","I thought that Ms. Rafkin's book didn't carry any particularly deep messages -- just some amusing stories about former clients, some despised, some not -- and some ""Miss Manners""-like instructions on how to behave as an employer of a cleaning professional should one find oneself in that situation. However, shortly after reading the book my toddler came down with a serious virus, and I discovered that, as I stayed up with him several nights in a row, cleaning suddenly had a remarkably calming and theraputic effect. I think Ms. Rafkin's book was more moving and persuasive than I had realized as I read it the first time. This book is particularly recommended for those people, such as myself, who look only to the results of cleaning rather than the process as the reason for doing it."
1,"If you like Jerry Springer, you'll love this book","Rafkin's book is doing well, which is fortunate for her, because she surely has driven a stake through the heart of her cleaning business by publishing it. The self-portrait she paints reveals her to be the kind of woman who would stab you in the back just after proclaiming you her best friend. THEN she'd have the gall to ""tsk, tsk"" you because the knife's no longer clean! This book left me feeling soiled, not unlike the revulsion one feels after watching a Jerry Springer episode."
4,"A View from the ""Other Side"" of Life","It's a bit difficult to determine when the author is stretching a point or stating the facts. She brings us inside the world that most of us never experience -- domestic service. It goes beyond cleaning to a calling. The books leads to the inevetable ending where she joins a commune of Japanese cleaners who try to live the noble life of self effacing service to her conclusion that it is time for her to go home and ""clean house.""Nothing here is a revelation. Just a peek into a world that few, if any of us readers, have experienced. A nice read with more than a bit of good humor."
5,Al Stump deserves a medal of honor,"How Al Stump could have tolerated living with Ty Cobb while being his acquaintance (friend?), nursemaid, gopher, and storywriter, should be considered an act of charity. For the opportunity to write a story (whose facts may have been altered somewhat at Cobb's insistence)about baseball's greatest competitor (and batter), Stump put his life on the line. His depiction of a tired, ailing, psycotic and bitter old man who half-heartedly wanted the world to know ""the truth"" about Tyrus Raymond Cobb evoked so many emotions that I couldn't put the book down. If you want to know about the life of Ty Cobb - for better or worse - this book is an eye opener."
3,Stump had an axe to grind.,"Ok, this book is extremely entertaining, and very informative. It displays Cobb as unquestionably a candidate for one of the top two or three players in baseball history. Stump seemed to have been trying to counteract the sterile Cobb certified biography done by him early in his career by writing a tell all book about his time with Cobb. I have read several books on Cobb, and I have read many other books about players that knew him talked about him. I think Stump went to far in his depicting Cobb as a nearly psychotic person. Perhaps he had a bit of an axe to grind against Cobb, but I don't think this portrayal is fair. The real Cobb was probably somewhere between his other biographies and the psychotic Cobb of Stump's work."
4,"Ty Cobb, the ballplayer","This is an incredible book. It's a great read for anyone who wants to know what it feels like to know someone so hated, yet a gem on the field, a genius at the plate, and a demon on the basepaths. Al Stump portrays this sports figure as legendary on the diamond, but a menace everywhere else. No one liked him, but he was better than everyone else of his day, or any day, for that matter. Some highlights are his 'restraining order' from the entire state of Ohio, his several run-ins with owner Frank Navin, and even baseball's only fatality is described(and how Cobb used it to his advantage). A good book, you come away with the feeling that you almost knew Cobb, but you're glad you didn't."
4,Cobb's Inner Demons?,"There's no doubt that Ty Cobb had a chip on his shoulder for his entire life. Big deal. He didn't commit any crimes, and despite popular belief, he never played ""dirty baseball""; he was simply quite cunning.Cobb was no doubt a flawed individual; he was rascist and was probably more than a little disturbed by the manner in which his father lost his life; shot to death by mommy dearest, who thought dad was an ""intruder"". Somehow, that one sounds hard to believe.Once you get past all the personal traumas and various skeletons in the closet of Ty Cobb, you can't help but believe Ty Cobb would be a great player in any era, and is perhaps the greatest player of all-time, with the possible exception of another flawed American hero by the name of Ruth."
5,intriguing,I found this book very fascinating. Stump gets into the complexities of a baseball perfectionist while interweaving the complexities of a truly disturbed and unstable man. The story is well told and intriguing.
4,Scariest Saul I've read,"This is my sixth Saul book I've read and it might be my favorite so far. ""Hand"" grabs you in the opening with a very scary scene. This sets the stage for what awaits the Conway family. Some very scary visuals. I'm not sure if any of Saul's work has been turned into movies but this would make a good one. Quick read, worth checking out."
4,Quick ending...,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. I could not put it down, and read the last half of the book in one sitting. I felt the end came abruptly, but I find that a lot in the horror genre. I thought there was good character development, and Mr. Saul had me liking and hating characters at his whim. Not much for thrills, but rarely do I find them in books as much as I do movies, others may disagree. Overall, I enjoyed it, and would definitely recommend Creature and the Blackstone Chronicles as well."
3,Same old Saul still delivers.,"Despite all the snazzy set dressing he can come up with in terms of story concept, horror writer John Saul writes with such a consistent tone and stock characters that it makes his novels both dependable and predictable reading.The Right Hand of Evil is yet another tale of a miserable family moving into a quaint, isolated, and very small town with a dark, nasty secret to hide (invariably relatives of the newcomers are smack in the middle of it all). Slowly the horrors of the past rise up and engulf our hapless protagonists. The only difference from Saul's other supernatural based horror chillers is that animals, and not children, get the brunt of the torture, so animal lovers beware.As a quick, gruesome read The Right Hand of Evil has enough spooky moments to make it a suitable diversion for a lazy summer afternoon in the hammock, or a rainy winter night in front of the fire. Recommended to his fans."
3,"There is only one word for this book, strange.",I liked the book but I'm not so sure about the ending.
4,Pretty good horror story...,"I made a mistake and purchased the abridged audio book version of this book. And while I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it a little scary at times, I'm sure I missed a lot of good reading by having an abridged version. But aside from that sad fact, the book is good. I expected it to be a very weak horror story, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think if I'd read every word of this book, it's one I wouldn't have read alone."
2,Weak story - not as good as his other books,"I did not like this book, it was a struggle to finish. The first 300 pages were dull, and seemed written for children except for a few scenes. I kept looking for Barney or Kermit to appear. While the last part of the book was better it did not make up for the simplistic first 300 pages. I read The Presence and liked it, this book was a letdown."
3,Saul's best effort since Creature.,"Good old Gothic Devil and Demons horror that starts a little slow but builds to a very dramatic, descriptive ending. The Conway's of St Albans only thought Ted's drinking was a nightmare !! Just wait till they get a load of Jarred (the son). This is a teriffic story of possession and EVIL that rivals the Exorcist. Way to go John, keep em coming !!!"
2,"Lame, but would make a great B-Movie.","Complete with ""My husband's a drunk but I'm too weak to leave him"" Stupid-Woman Syndrome and some adolescent sex, here is a sorry tale. The first few pages pulled me in, building up the suspense only to be disappointed by the rest of the book's predictability. Like lambs to the slaughter, the characters in this book followed an unimaginative path and most are unable to overcome their personal weaknesses. It's not their strength of character or religious beliefs that save them but rather a trivial token which saves the author from having to think of a more original ending."
5,Saul never manages to let his fans down.,Saul's latest creation is one more strand in the web of his talent that always leaves his readers begging for more. THE RIGHT HAND OF EVIL is perhaps his best yet. His characters and environments are so real you feel as if you are a fly on the wall. The atmosphere he can create can send a chiver down your spine that lasts for days. THE RIGHT HAND OF EVIL is a sure-fire hit that I would recommend to anyone who is not having trouble sleeping.
5,The Right Hand of Evil,I would reccomend it to anyone who likes a good scare. It was a bout a house that had awful things happen in it and the new age family that moves into it. Really wierd things start to happen to people who live there. They hear wierd things in the night. They can hear things moving in the attic upstairs. This book reminded me of a book called Can You hear My Silent Screams. But i would only rate that book as a 3 because it was no where as scary as The Right Hand of Evil.
1,The Right Hand of Evil,This book was BORING! I love John Saul books - what happened here? Was this cranked out for the sake of cranking out another bestseller? I almost did not want to buy Nightshade. But I took the plunge and loved Nightshade - readers save your money - buy Nightshare instead.
2,Cliche,"Maybe I am spoiled because my previous experience with Saul was so good - The Blackstone Chronicles. I really thought that was an excellent piece of work. So, I was in the mood for another horror yarn and I picked this up. And I was dissappointed!It seems like Saul knocked this one out as quickly as possible just to have a presence on the bookshelves - its plot was cliche and its ending very predictable. Characters were tragically underdeveloped and certain elements of the story that appeared as if they were intended to be important, went nowhere.All-in-all, not the best thing I've read this month. Not awful but bordering on a waste of time."
2,Shocked!,"With The Right Hand of Evil, Mr. Saul has definitely crossed the line. I was totally shocked and disgusted by the gratuitous violence. The animal mutilations and murders sickened me. It will be a long time before I pick up another John Saul book."
1,Don't Waste Your Time-Totally Lame!,"First off I want to say, this was my first ever Saul book. I know this guy is VERY popular but after reading this book, I'm completely puzzled as to why. This book was BAD. A total rehash of 100 different horror movies I've seen. Dreams about sex & the devil (Rosemary's Baby anyone?), voodoo, possessed family members (Damien, I presume?), a creepy old house with a scary reputation (wow that's new!). How this book ever got published is beyond me. My first and last John Saul book."
3,Just OK,"I quit reading John Saul's works several years ago, because while I enjoyed them at first, I found he used the same type of tricks in each story. My sister said it best: ""Once you've read one of his books, you've read them all."" But I wanted something to read and thought I'd see if his more recent works would convince me to add him to my ""favorite authors"" list.While THE RIGHT HAND OF EVIL didn't wow me, it at least seemed different than his usual stuff (keeping in mind I'm talking about works I read back in the 80's). It wasn't great, and was similar to other haunted/possessed house stories I'd read by other authors, but it was better than nothing. I might give him another chance, if the subject interested me, but I wouldn't expect greatness. I hope he surprises me next time."
3,"Good, but not great.....","I love John Saul, but found this to be a mildly satisfying read--not one of his best. I found it predictable and not as suspenseful as his other books. Treat yourself to ""Midnight Voices"" or ""The Unloved"" or ""Suffer the Children"" before reading this one and you will see what I mean."
1,Far from his best,"I only kept reading this after the first third because I'd bought it to get me through a long train ride. It was a ""page-turner"" only in the sense that I wanted it to be over as soon as possible. Multiple cliches, no psychological insight, gratuitous pet mutilation, weak and unpleasant characters, no attempt to bring any degree of depth to the proceedings, and a conclusion that is in no way satisfying combine to make this perhaps the least of this authors efforts of the half dozen of his novels that I have read. Very disappointing. Not recommended."
1,Leave it on the Shelf,"Unfortunately, your rating scale doesn't go into minus numbers. Flat characters, boring story and animal mutilation - was John Saul always this bad? It may just be that I've outgrown this particular genre, but in my opinion, this wasn't worth the paper it was printed on. It just goes to prove - when it comes to the ""creepies"", stick to the 'King'!"
2,Rehashed Stew,"John Saul has turned out some incredibly good books: ""The Homing,"" ""Shadows,"" and ""The Blackstone Chronicles,"" to name just a few. His dark, pessimistic view of life, particularly of youths and their parents, has always been a little disturbing, but his stories have held our interest and got us caught up in the plots effectively. Not so with this book. John has written this book so many times, I have to wonder why he bothered. It's so predictable! Hopefully, his upcoming release will exonerate him from this pedestrian effort!"
3,The Right Hand of Evil - interesting but not thrilling.,"This is the first book I have read by John Saul. It was given great reviews by my book club and by the audio-reviewer, Booktalk. I decided to purchase it and read it over the long weekend. I thought it was a pretty good book, it held my interest to the end and didn't disappoint me. But there were a few aspects of it that I didn't like, such as the exuberent amount of dream sequences. I felt it was too much to always be thrusted into others dreams, and would have rather seen the characters in a non-comatose state. Also, I felt that most scenes were over described and that some of the setting should be left to the reader's imagination. But overall it was a scary read which left me with doubts about my own basement!"
3,Would Make A Better Movie,"As usual of John Saul's books, a family is overcome by EVIL. However, you never really get to understand the source of the evil -- is it the house or the curse passed on through the male children of the family?John describes some pretty scary stuff going on in the house -- however it comes too late in the book. You spend most of the time working up to one major evil happening -- the end.Oh well -- maybe next time I'll be scared."
2,The Left Hand of Predictable,"John Saul wrote this one for the bucks. Cashing in on his name, he has released a storyline that is at best predictable and juvinile. My son wrote better stories in the 8th grade.Pass on this one and go for one of his other books. Most of the others are good. This is a book you can read in a weekend, but it is filled with B rated horror cliches.I could give you a synopsis, but you've seen/read it a million times already. Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."
1,Not thrilled,"I used to love to read John Saul's books - It must have been a teen thing, because this one just grossed me out."
1,time is too scarce to spend it on this book,"The preface is the most exciting part of this book. It goes downhill from there. I kept going and going hoping it would get better, but no luck. The book makes it out to be a mystery, perhaps scifi, and about black magic. But it ended up instead being a boring uneventful book about being in a marriage with an alcoholic spouse, cleaning up a large house, going to school and trying to fit into a new school with a touch about teenagers and their pot smoking rebellion. I think you have to be high to enjoy this book."
2,What happened to a very good horror author?,"I see by the list that I will write one bad review among at this time, 9 rave reviews. I have read ALL of John Saul's books and thought he got better with age, but what happened here? This book didn't just grab me and not let go as so many of his earlier books, especially The Blackstone Chronicles. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better but, at least for me, it never did. I hate to say I was relieved when I finally finished this book. Come on John, try, try again. But thanks for the earlier books."
4,Very good book with a dud of an ending,"Very good book. It had you gripping your seat all through it. That is, until you reached the end."
3,"I liked it, I liked it not","This was the first book by John Saul that i read, and i found it compelling in that i wanted to know what the whole deal was behind the family curse, the storyline was decent but not all that original. I did not think it was as bad as some of the other reviews but you might, this book is kinda up to the reader. I got through the book faster than normal, but that might have been due to the fact that i wanted to hurry up and read it so that i could start reading something more exciting. Read at own risk!"
2,A Disappointment,"I have read every one of John Saul's books, and I was sorely disappointed with this one. The writing was weak, the dialogue unrealistic, and the characters unlikeable. I think John Saul is a very talented writer, but something was seriously lacking from this book. It read like it was slapped together and dashed off to the publisher. Skip this and read Nightshade... Now there's a great read!"
2,Not the best form john,"It might be a novel by one of the greatest but not a winner. The story revolves around a spirit that dwells in a haunted house and control the lives of some who live within.The starting is really interesting but as the plot unfolds, the only thing worth addictive is the sole curiousity ... what will happen at the end? and still you may not be satisfied."
3,The Right Hand is only a standard Saul story.,"Once again a troubled family moves to a small town caught in some kind of time warp (all small towns in John Saul-land are like something out of Pleasantville) that is equally troubled by some hideous secret that terrify the elderly, confound the middle aged, and are humorously dismissed by the local teen-agers (at least in front of their friends). Soon all hell breaks loose and people (most often teen-agers and children) begin dropping like flies. Saul has told this same story since 1977 and, more often than not, it works quite well.Just not this time.The Right Hand of Evil starts off promisingly, with a well drawn look at a marriage disintergrating under the burden of alcoholism. But then Saul begins his standard histronics. Not particularly frightening, but some scenes do pack a punch. I would recommend this for diehard Saul fans only. Those looking for better books from this author should try Creature or The Homing."
3,Cool,"I loved how John described the setting and how the lone house differed from the rest of the town. It feels very isolated. Creepy setting and nice story line, but theres a -2 from a perfect 5 score because of how I could kinda relate this book to ""The Shining"" by ""Steven King""."
2,Nice try but..Not So Great,"Not the greatest Saul book.I think the storyline was a good idea but the plotting was terrible. I was disappointed because in the past, John Saul has been a fabulous writer. I don't know what happened w/this book. The beginning was much more interesting than the middle of the book. The dreams of the characters were confusing because I wasn't sure if it was actually occurring.... A few paragraphs later, the reader realizes that it was just a dream. I also think the writer rushed through some scenes in order to get to the next ""scary"" scene. It really wasn't as eerie as Saul's novels usually are. If this was your first John Saul read, please DO NOT give up...his other books are much much better."
2,worthy of a B movie,"I couldn't help but think of a B movie while reading this book. He repeats himself several times, the dialog is ridiculous and I spent most of my time reading fast (not enjoying or relishing the book) so I could get through with it. Predictable, not fun, not scary, not original. Not worth it."
5,I AM A NEW FAN!,"This book was great! I love the style of John Saul's writing! It is so graphic, yet simple, it makes you wonder why you haven't written anything like this. The plot is twisted, the story morbid, the charecters' deceiptful. My kind of novel! Entertaining from beginning to end and completely shocking! Great, highly recommended read! Five Out Of Five"
1,Disappointed,"I just finished Right Hand of Evil and was extremely disappointed. I'm not a fan of of the occult and satanism, but I thought I'd give Mr. Saul the benefit of the doubt on this one since he has given me some chills in his other books. None were to be had though. I found the plot neither terrifying or interesting. Again extremely disappointed and I only give this one star simply because I can't give it less."
2,Boring book.,"If you find any original idea, plot or characters, please let me know. After reading a few pages, I knew the end. This is my first John Saul's book; I think Steven King is a much better writer.One interesting thought, if the gourmet burger is the same price and fast service as McDonald's, most people wouldn't bother with McDonald's. John Saul's book is about the same price as other good writer's books, and we have only limited time, why bother with John Saul's."
2,Entertaining but lacks Saul's usual depth and creativity.,This book probably would translate well into a movie. It lacks depth but was enjoyable while it lasted. It took me longer to read than most due to the fact that it wasn't something I couldn't put down.
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"This reminded me of Saul's Blackcreek Crossing. I found myself confusing the two stories since they both involve a drunk dad, a tolerant mom, and teens as victims. This story was at least a little more mature for its intended audience. It wasn't the best but it wasn't a complete waste of time either."
1,Don't waste your time,"I picked this up at the library thinking it would be a good mystery, suspense. It was a big disappointment. The plot is predictable and the story and characters are weak. I found the use of God's name taken in vain horrible. There is constant swearing and its not necessary. John Saul is always writing about death,and evil. I think he needs to have a heart to heart with God and get it straight before he writes another book."
4,The best explanation of patanjali's yogasutras,"It is an insightful look at Patanjali's yogasutras. These 'sutras' (principles) are gist of meditation guidelines given in the upanishads. Vivekanands, with his broad and deep knowledge of ancient literature provides a good expostion of these profound principles. The stimulating and magnetic style of Vivekanada's lectures and books is not to be found in this book. The principles are difficult to understand by themselves and call for the direction of a teacher for correct understanding and Vivekananda fulfills this role very well."
1,Awful,"This is one of the most modern sexist narratives of history that I have ever encountered. Especially in the chapter about Victoria Woodhull, Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz paints a picture of woman that is of emotional, vindictive people. She says that Woodhull ""targets"" Henry Beecher to further her own goals. I'm sorry, but it is not her fault that he actively denounced sexual relationships while simultaneously having an affair with his close friends wife for years. He is the definition of sexual hypocrisy. One would think that Horowitz would be critical of Beecher, but no, she condemns Woodhull for releasing this story. She treats as a moody woman who took her PMS out on an innocent, lovely pastor. I was incredibly disappointed with this book and I am ashamed that it was written so recently."
2,Very expensive to maintain!,"Bought it from Sam's Club in 2006. I burned three bulbs already! No matter what you do, the bulb will not last longer than 1500 hours. It is not a bad projector, but the bulb reliability makes it a very expensive projector. I spent $1200 on bulbs for a projector that cost $600."
5,Straight Old School Player!,This album could've had only the cut I've Got So Much To Give and still it would be BOMB! I've Found Someone and I'm Gonna Love... completes it.
1,not the song I'm looking for,"This is not the song I am interest. I do not know the name of it, its a very old song by Barry White, I believe. He SAYS a lot ""I love you"" and there's a backgrouwnd of femenine voices. If you know what song this is please write to me. I've been searching for so long.jcrooks@earthlink.net thanks"
4,surprisingly great for the price,"I didn't expect much from this fairly cheap subwoofer: I wanted a subwoofer for my home theater, and that's it. I was impressed with all of the options built-into the subwoofer. There is a ""super-bass"" option in addition to the usual volume option. There's a power button to turn it off without having to unplug it. The bass is directed downward which is exactly as one would want a subwoofer. There are RCA type plugs on the back so be sure your stereo receiver uses this type of connection. Pleasantly happy with the sound."
5,Great for kids and parents!,"This is an upbeat, comical CD with great music for kids and parents. Parents, you'll find yourself listening to this music even when the kids aren't around! This will become your favorite kid music to play, I promise!"
2,Way too salty,"This may be better than a bouillon cube, but it's still not great. This Better Than Bouillon isn't absolutely terrible for straight stock but if you try to then use that stock to make sauces or demi-glazes, instead of getting a richer flavor, ugh, they just get saltier and saltier and saltier as the reduction occurs. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for Minor's."
1,RIP OFF,Boy did I feel silly when I found this exact item at a specialty store downtown for $5.00. I paid $11.45 on Amazon.Buyer BEWARE!
2,Too salty,"Typical of the US food industry, they have to pack the product full of salt. By the time you you get the saltiness diluted out all the flavor is diluted out."
2,Very salty,"Very salty and not as much protein as I would have hoped for. Not sure I will buy again. I was hoping for a very rich reduced beef sauce, to be used as a soup. May need to make my own."
1,"Too S A L T Y , not enough B E E F !","I've tried to use this product for several dishes including au jus,beef barley soup, roast beef, beef gravy and others.The S A L T gets in the way and the results are most often an off-beef flavor.If you try to ""thin"" the beef base with more liquid you end up with athin salty hardly beef flavored anything. Most notable flavor is celery followedby onion followed by garlic and then maybe the beef."
4,"A good migration studies book, with a female focus","Memories covers a fairly complex topic with a good sense of organization. The author communicates using a balance of academic level wording, but without the blatent 'My vocabulary is bigger then yours' attitude that so many books of this kind fall prey to. Of all the books for my migration course I had to read, this is the only one I looked forward to sitting down with. It's quite interesting reading."
1,Really awful,"I won't detail the failings of this book because others have described them here better than I can. I will just say that it's as bad as they say it is. It's really awful.One thing that I would like to add is that the popularity of this book and the other book of the series, Eragon, disturbs me. I wonder how many young readers mistakenly believe that they are are reading real literature. How much are these books contributing to the ""dumbing-down"" of the reading public? I urge anyone who considers getting either book to think again and get something else. There are many better choices available."
4,"Warm journey, warm feelings","In Eldest, Paolini succeeded in what good fantasy should do - remind us of the hidden and depthful, often secret and special, feelings we carry in ourselves.Paolini successfully conveys the authentic adolescent emotional experience of Eragon, and the continuing adventure awakened many of the nostalgic and sometimes conflicting emotions I felt as a teenager. Sure, as many of the reviews say: the plot can at times be predictable, much of it resembles Tolkien and Robin Hobb. Yet as any true fantasy fan should know, it's the experience that counts the most, not the complexity or any other such technical concept."
4,Better than Alot of these reviews say,"First- I am tired of reviewers expecting polished perfect books everytime- Ain't gonna happen.....This one was worth the money if you have read the first...a Better continuation than many experienced authors bring to the table and hopefully the third is better. Personally I was amazed that a teenager wrote these books- he will only get more experienced/better as he goes on.....Maybe it is sour grapes for other reviewers whose kids have no talent except to annoy others or ""Adults"" who expect a TEEN fantasy to satisfy them- NO X rated SEX- so sorry...it is also an excellent book for more mature adults who keep in mind where the book came from!"
1,YES UNIVERSALLY LOATHED,"I read a review of this book saying it was universally loathed and I agree to no end. Why you buying this awful book people? Even if Eragon was the first book you ever read in your life, it'd be impossible not to see how bad it is. Eldest is infinity times as bad. What's with all the characters talking like sesame street? How come it takes poopi boy a page and a half to describe the simplest thing? If this book was edited it'd be 200 pages not 700."
2,Parents Don't Dismay,"I note the audience is 5th grade and up. After struggling with the excessive description, the love interest, and the ping pong of the story line; maybe junior high was the intended audience. A good story if you are into fantasy, disappointing if you want a successful read. So, if your gift is placed down wait a few years. Better yet, donate to your local public library."
3,Entertaining and Unoriginal,"This is a solid three-star book. In rating a lot of things, you have your one-stars (a mistake for the genre), two-stars (interesting idea but technical crashes weigh it down), three stars (entertaining, just like those other 85 identical products), four-stars (original, lively, creative) and five-stars (exceptionally brilliant). This one falls in the three-star category. It tells a story that has been told the same way more than a few times. It adds unpronounceable words to keep the mind challenged in an otherwise unchallenging story. On the upside, it does have some unexpected things happen at the end. All in all, it's clumsy, unoriginal, at times boring, but ultimately moderately entertaining."
5,The Best Book In The WORLD!!!,"THis book is the best. I loved it. If you like sci-fi mixed with medieval with some magic tossed in you will love this book. I think Paolini organized it very well and he also depicted the different areas of the story perfectly. The book has difficult vocabulary and is written from 3rd person point of view. Paolini also was very inventive in creating ""Eldest"" and ""Eragon"".He uses foreshadowing and also analogies frequently to help the reader to understand the plot and details of the story. I really wish that the new book could come out sooner but you just can't rush the writing process."
5,"Awesome book, deserved the read!","Eldest by Christopher Paolini was great. From the very first page, Christopher Paolini makes you feel as if you have not left Farthen Dur. This book jumps out at you and makes you want to read it. Eldest is filled with adventure. The writing engages you and is paced to keep you interested page after page. Eragon is learning new things and becoming a more experienced fighter. His magic is improving and King Galbatorix is on the move. A climatic ending with an expected twist, makes the reader wish for the third installment in the series. The second story line with Rohan shows how the author has matured as a writer. Two plot lines make the book difficult to put down. This book shows how good of an author Christopher Paolini really is and I recommend this book to all!"
4,"Easy, gripping entertainment","It may be that there are better fantasy novels available. It may also be that there is a mixture ideas of different Authors in this book.Fact is, that this is an entertaining and gripping story. Don't compare it to others and simply enjoy the storyline.I can't wait to find out the conclusion of this Trilogy!"
1,Amazing! Almost as good as the phone book!,"One night, while eating a ham sandwich, I decided to go and read some stuff. So, I went out to a Books-A-Million and there stood the phone book with a new cover and the word ""ELDEST"" written in MASSIVE lettering. I wondered why they'd change the name of a phone book, so I glanced at it. Alas!, it was not a phone book, but an equally EXCITING read! What fun and joy swelled through my heart the minute I began to thumb trhough it! I purchased it immediately, with the money I had earned from working for two weeks in both McDonald's AND the laundromat. I give this book two million stars, even if I'm not able to ride the bus home now because of my money crisis! Yay! Thanks, Paolini!"
1,AWFUL,I couldn't agree more with all the previous reviewers who said this one is the worst book written. Eldest is laughably bad. Skip it!
1,What the heck?,I may be slow but I caught on that Lucille and other hypers keep re-posting their reviews every day. Why would any one do that except to try to keep up the impression peopel are luving this terrible book.I told myself I wasn't going to post a review even though I feel terribly disappointed but after seeing people playing games I felt obligated. Like most other readers I feel ripped off. I want my money back - I won't be reading another Paolini book in my life time. Even if it's a book by Paolini's dog I won't be reading it.
3,colse but no sigar,"I won't deny that Eldest is awsome but there's not as much umm.... what's the word... oh-ya ""exitment"" as there is in Eragon. It only took me five days to read Eragon, but it took me THREE WEEKS!!!! to read Eldest. And that was during x-mas vaction too and twice I'd stayed up all night to read portions of it. The ending is awsome though, wourth the long reading wait, but one thing still bothers me. How is it that Galbatorix can tell what sex a dragon is in the shell? And if he can't then.... that.... means...."
2,Why torture your readers with overused cliches?,"Look I will write novel also.""Watch out of the Dragon Herithusiskarsham!"" said tiny elf warrior. ""It almost kill me!""The dragon put claws on the elf and carried him away.""Farghin Fargh,"" said Wizard Gordalfo Pundrazzorini. ""Dragon is have elf master Drist Ferllodf in its claws!""Troll Warrior Glumsteff put axe in hand and throws at dragon. ""Harrr! Is in pain now dragon?""Wizard made lightning bolt and seared dragons head. ""Ow,"" said dragon. ""In pain now!"" And dropped elf.So, with this writing, how can kid make money? Cause he is a kid and people cheer that he is not on meth because he lives in Montana outback. He has no friends or life, except with hippy mom and stoner dad. Why is kid not on stoner pot too? Because his invisible dragon friend says NO to drugs.If you think Stephen King is rot on paper, please to read this kid, now old enough to drink. World, beware! Next book... The Drunken Troll-King of Nothern Montana!"
2,Reply to the person below me,"This is the 'best book you've read in your life'? Come on.1You're only 12-13--I'm not sure you've had a long enough life to read a whole lot of great books! (obviously, I'm not any older myself, but I'm not going to use my 'whole life' as a considerable time frame)"
5,This is one of my favourite books ever ... and i've read ALOT of books,"Its hard to tell whether this sequal is even better than Eragon itself but i would have to say yes! It is interesting to see how Eragon changes in this book how he has to focus alot more on his training as the fate of alagaesia is hanging in the balance. Also the added story of Roran gives the book a bit of a background, i found that i couldnt wait for the two stories to meet.A lot of people say that the book sort of falls apart nearer the end but i dont agree. There is one point in the book where i wanted to stop reading it but that wasnt out of boredom but because i didnt want what was happening in the book to happen.All in all it is a fantastic book that keeps you hooked from the start!"
2,There are way better reads,This book was way to long. If you want a great undiscovered book with tons of imagination read Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo. It shows how good a non-hyped book can be.
2,Try to keep going!,"If you can get through the first 2/3rd's of this, and it won't be easy, then it gets better... Not good, but better. The worst moment for me was when a reference was made to the movie ""Scarface"" that destroyed all sense of suspension of disbelief for pages after. Then again, movie references shouldn't be a shock with this book -- it's ""surprise"" plot twist at the end is an inch away from Luke hearing the guy in the black mask is his father... Wow, didn't see that one coming."
4,Much improvement over Eragon,"This is the second book in a series. Eragon was the first, written when the author was a teenager. The author is showing more maturity in his writing. He does a better job of developing his major characters. His plot is not nearly so perdictable and the problems are not all solved by magic. I have enjoyed this book very much."
4,its Ok ...,"the book was good and perfect but it was kinda boring because there was an over discriptions and so many stories sometimes i forced my self to finish this book but when i finished i thought the ending was great althought its not the end of this tale but you definetly get what you expect from 700 pages i mean only talented writes could keep you thrilled while reading 700 or more pages so you well get keen at some chapters and you well get bored at others and thats how it is""this book is much like eragon but with alittle bit of new adventures and stories and charecters"""
3,I challenge everyone,"Even though this book was a medley of diffrent books put together,I challenge anyone to come up with a COMPLETELY ORIGINAL idea.It can't be from any type of mythology.Don't make a mockery of great writers by claiming their ideas as yours. If you can come up with a new idea you can continue your critcism."
4,Eldest a dragon above the rest,Very excellent sequel. My daughter and I enjoyed it from start to finish.
2,Found it Tedious,"i loved the first book, Eragon. i was really excitied to get a hold of Eldest, but as soon as i started reading, i found it very dismal. the author is trying to display his great vocaulary, but all he does is bore the reader, and make the reader confused. there was still some humor in it, and the secrets that are revealed are interesting and suprising. i would reccomend it, but be prepare to find yourself midly uninterseted in most parts."
2,Thoughts from my 12 year old son,"Nothing can compare to the first book. The second book was a disappointment in the way it was written- too choppy and rushed. The author needed to spend more time doing finishing work to the book. There were areas of the book where there was no danger, where something should have happened but nothing did, though the expectation was there, such as the journey into the Elf City. Nothing happened, it was completely boring. I had a hard time getting into the book, unlike the first one, which I could not put down. I did not like the character switches and found it distracting from the over-all story. He needs to learn how to make the characters flow together. I hope that this author will read his first book again and do a better job on the third book and bring everyone together in a smoother format. I hope Mr. Paolini takes his time on the next one. He is a talented writer with a great story."
3,fun but a bit flat,"People like to criticize Poulini a lot. I don't want to jump on that pile. He's a very young author and he's writing a book primarily for a young adult audience. Adults with higher standards might find it disappointing. It's not War and Peace, but it's still fun."
2,ELDEST,"Item arrived damaged broken into 3 parts front cover, spine with 3 rings and disc attached, and the back cover. 2 of the disc [3 and 19] were so scratched that I could not understand what was said. I notified company via email and they sent a full refund immediately.Love the reader's voice. He read long passages in both elf and dwarf and his accent changed consistenly with each one. He had a different voice for each character and culture too, of course. I had no trouble knowing who was talking. Listening to him kept me awake on long boring road trips."
2,Disappointing,"Why I have to give credit to Christopher for experimenting with multiple points of view, he didn't pull it off successfully. Most of Eragon's story was dull description of the elves' home (which reminded me heavily of descriptions from LoTR) while Nasuada's was too short and came off as a cheap way to show the audience what was happening to the Varden. With the exception of a couple chapters, Roran's pov was the more interesting of the three because he actually did some important things during it. The pacing was overall a bit long as well and some parts felt like they could have benefited from more editing. I truthfully preferred Eragon over this book."
3,Very good until the very end,"This book contained a lot of character development for Eragon. Because of the author's writing style, it was very engaging and not at all boring. The sentences and language were rich and deep. There were many little pieces of mystery that kept me on the ""edge of my seat"" throughout the entire novel. I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating if not for the extremely disappointing Star Wars like ending. But since this was such a small portion of the book, and at the very end, it did not ruin the whole experience. Enjoyable overall. I recommend you read it."
4,A must read for LOTR and HP fans,"This book was as engaging and exciting as the first book of Paolini's series, but only better written. While it is written as a kids' book, adults will be just as thrilled to read the Eldest. Paolini's style matured a bit in this book to show that he has grown as an author from Eragon. One of my favorite scenes is when Eragon physically changes after the elven ceremony. The elven kingdom so wonderfully described so that you can see it in your mind. And of course I love the the huge surprise at the end of the book!If you liked reading the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter this is a book for you!"
1,Put this book down!,ok well dispite all the rip offs of this series I liked the first book. I read it in one sitting. But Eldest is another thing alltogether! It took me nearly a year to finish it. I read the first chapter and there was nothing sucking me into the book so I put it down and could not pick it up again. I made the BIG mistake of actually buying the book. This is not a mistake that you should make! If you really want to read this book go get it out of the library.
3,"Not so good, not so bad","Ok.I'm like a really big fan of the Eragon books. I mean, I cried when I got hold of Eldest. When I started this book, I kind of had this vibe in the beginning that told me that this book isn't going to be as good as the first book, Eragon. Now, Eragon rocked. It was really good. When I finished Eldest, I knew that Paolini tried to improve his writing, try to hold the suspence, but man did he mess it up!! He did add some surprises in the end so that's why this book didn't get a 1 star from me. But, in the beginning and middle, Paolini made the chapters so dragging and boring that I seriously wanted to skip like five chapters to the end. If I wasn't such a big fan of the Eragon books, you wouldn't be reading this review. My suggestions to you is to borrow Elest from the library and save your freaking time on this book. PLEASE. You don't want to be as frustrated as I was."
5,not a boring book,"My son will not read. This book and the first in the series, ""Eragon"", he would not put down. I literally had to force him to put these books down to sleep. If you have a reluctant reader in your family, try these books."
1,"Lazy writing, poor story","It was so difficult to get through. I had a really hard time reading something so poorly written. It is filled with poor prose and things that make you go Huh? He does an awful lot of rantings but not a lot of anything to the point. Going on and on about nothing most of the time. As other reviewers have said ""read the reviews"". Don't waste your money on this."
5,AMAZING SEQUEL,"Eragon seemed boring and baby-ish to me, but now I found out that it was just setting the scene for this amazing story. Everyone is sure to like Eldest, whether you prefer romance, mystery or action.Just make sure that you read Eragon first, though, or u will find urself a little confused....Plus, there are more:->scenes with Eragon and Arya for those who enjoyed the romance.->adventures->actionso dont be shy by the size-PICK ONE UP TODAY!!!"
1,Put me to sleep,Anyone blowing smoke at you about it is on something cuz let me tell you it is booooooring. I held in there cuz they say the end is good yeah right. just said it so you wouldn't return it and get your money back. Peace out.
1,"Poorly written, dull story","I am giving this book one star despite the fact that judged on its own merits it probably deserves zero stars. And I am doing it for a very very very good reason - this is the worst book ever printed (even worse than Eragon if there were possible) but if the author and publisher were smart enough to sucker us all in to buying it probably deserves at least one star.Bottom line, I'd be lying if I said otherwise. Start this series if you want to but don't say nobody warned you..."
1,I couldn't find it!!!!,This book was sooooooo stupid! i couldn't find the battery compartment in it! if you don't like trouble then don't buy it if you can't look very well! I WANT TO FIND THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT!!!!!
3,Very boring book,"I was so excited to get this book, then once i read it, i was so upset. All he does is go visit old people and learn how to meditate or something like that (very boring) I stopped reading it after i grew sick of elfs!! What i liked about Eragon is that its an adventure but this is just like reading about classes. Please write a better version of this book!!!!"
1,Didn't like it,"Eldest had all the problems of Eragon. Overly descriptive, derivative, awkward dialogue, and dull characters. And in some parts it was preachy.I know what some of you are thinking. ""You can't criticize Eldest. I don't see you writing a better book."" So I have to publish a novel before I'm allowed to have an opinion? That's a laugh. HAHAHAHAHA!!!"
1,Not Impressed,"Sorry I am just not impressed. The writing is that of a child of whom the author is. To compare his book to that of the Lord of the Rings is an insult. No imagination, or originality. Go ahead and read it if you want something that mimics other books. I however would rather read something original."
1,Dry and dull,"The Inheritance trilogy embodies the worst of the fantasy genre. I can't stand the blatant Tolkien ripoffs. It's as if Paolini thinks that in fantasy, stealing from other authors is not only okay but necessary.Oh, and the huge, unneccessary info dumps during Eragon's training. Paolini has fallen so in love with the elven society he dreamed up that he neglected the story.I'll commend Paolini for the character Elva. As far as I know, she is Paolini's only original creation. Though if I find out that she's been ripped off from somewhere too, I won't be surprised."
2,Where was his editor?,"The first book was a fairly solid read. Not great, but entertaining. And coming from a 19 year old, the future looked promising. But as often happens to those who experience success very early, things start to go downhill quickly.This book needed an editor to step in and say no. It is long and boring and the entire subplot with Roran is mystifying. Brom and Eregagon need all of their skills and magic to get away from the bad guys (which kills Brom), but Roran just needs a hammer and a bunch of villagers???The time Eragon spends with Osmosis (or whatever the heck his name is) in the dark mysterious Elven woods reads way too much like Luke and Yoda on Degoba. And it just goes on and on and on. I don't blame the writer, the professionals around him let him down badly."
1,Not worth it,"I must admit that I did not find Eldest as I expected. It's long, boring, and stupid. I found myself doing chores and homework so I had excuses not to read.Do two things:1. Read the reviews2. Instead of paying for it get it from the libraryI did both and I am glad I did."
1,Awful doesn't begin to cover it,"Any real criticism of Eragon and Eldest seems to magically disappear. How does that happen? Why does that happen? How many reviews from real people never got posted in the first place? Is it designed to make us think people love these books? Well it's not working, the word is out: Eragon and Eldest SUCK!! Eragon had laughably bad writing and if it were possible the writing in Eldest is even worse."
3,Middle of the road ...,"I didn't think the book was horrible, but it wasn't great either. I thought the same of Book 1. I do agree with other reviews that the editing was quite a mess. Still, it was entertaining in sections and I didn't hate it. It is by no means on the level of the beautiful writing of Lord of the Rings. I tried to keep in mind that the writer is quite young and inexperienced as it does show in his writing."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I just finished reading this book. It is one of the best books I have ever read and I am an avid reader. This book was truly amazing especially all the detail involved. Paolini can create a picture in your head of even the finest details. I mean wow just wow.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. Buy this book you won't regret it.
5,Eldest,"Eldest, by Christoper Paolini is an amazing book! This book is about the hardships Eragon, the Varden [ a resistance of King Galbatorix], Roran, and countless other endure after the battle in Farthern Dur. It goes into detail on Eragon's training as a rider as he is taught by a legacy. Eragon and everyone who knows him is sworn in the ancient language not to tell of the existance of the Cripple Who Is Whole. Eragon also experiences a miraculous alteration with his body. Many celebrate the victory at Farthern Dur, but an upcoming battle is on the horizon. Roran, an outlaw by the Empire, has to save his village of Carvahall from the Raz'ac. What will he do to save them? Can the Varden defeat the almighty Empire and save all who live in Alagaesia from the wrath of King Galbatorix? I loved this book and give it 5 out of 5 stars, when you read this book you will feel as if you are living the story! Read Eldest, by Christopher Paolini to find out!"
3,Very enjoyable...,"Like the first in the series 'Eragon', I found Eldest to be very engaging and interesting. The plot was predictable, but it was predictable in good ways. I find this series very interesting and easy to read.Looking forward to the third."
5,Great battle sequences,"I absolutely loved Eragon, and I was pretty pleased with this book as well. Granted, there were MANY dull parts to it, but all of the action completely made up for it. I especially loved the battle at the end of the book. Those three chapters or so were probably the best out of them all.[...]"
4,pretty sweet,"I thought that this book was pretty good. I liked it and can't wait for the movies! I like a lot of these kid's fantasy books, like harry potter and battle for arkwood, so this was a natural book choice!"
4,pretty good,"Well first of all I don't like that it has it's own language because it get's pretty annoying to go back in the book to see what there saying. also it seems that all the names have to have a weird pronunciation. Well now to get to the reason why I really gave it a four star, it was because in the end it is sort of like star wars when Murtagh told Eragon that he was his brother makeing Morzan his father whichEragon hated, but in the end it was still written very well."
4,"Good, but long and some parts boring.","It was a excellent book, lots of it writen very well, but it got bumped down because it was long and all the stuff about roran and oromises training were BORING!!"
4,"Eldest, predictable but fun",i thought Eldest was breathtaking. Allthough to me the beginning didn't have me biting my nails but as the story progressed I found myself intrigued by the imagery and feeling Christopher put into this book. The problem I had with this book is that by just raeding Eragon I was finding myself perfectly fore seeing events and watching my predictions unfold infront of me. In the end I think that this is just as good a read as Eragon if not better and it is definetly worth any fantasy fan's atention
1,Awful doesn't begin to cover it,"I saw reviews of this people were gushing praise then I read the book and thought what the #%@$!. I didn't want to tell anyone I hated it. Thank God to see I'm not alone... the vast majority hated this dreadful book as much as I did.Truth be told, reading reviews of Eldest was more fun than reading the book. There are so many dead on reviews I won't even begin to try to say how tedius this was to read. Like in the title of my review awful doesn't begin to cover it."
4,Eldest--Better than the 1st,"Loved this book! Paolina rights so well, like the magicians in parts of his narrative he weaves you into the story and you care about the characters & their trials & tribulations. Just read Brsinger as well & it's even better--further character development & in depth history is revealed. What an author--look forward to the next in the series and sadly the last. He is one of the writers who weaves such a wonderful tale you want to eat it up but dread coming to the end because you know you will miss the characters & the wonderful world he has created. Hopefully, more great novels will follow this series."
5,Great continue of a great start,It seems that even when the first book in a series is great the second or third one absoluley sucks. Not with something Cristopher Paolini writes!! The first book was great but the second was (if anything) even better because of his maturity in his writing style. The parellel storyline with Roran add a huge amount to the book.A great book and a fun read!
1,George Lucas just may have a lawsuit on his hands...,"What more needs said? Why didn't Paolini just start the books... ""A long time ago in a Middle Earth far far away?""It's like he took George Lucas' plot outlines and just changed the names and locations. The comparisons to Tolkein are more thinly veiled and possibly more forgivable, the guy practically invented the fantasy genre as we know it, and its tough to stray from his world.But the Star Wars similarities are uncanny. Using a tried and true formula is not unheard of... (ie: hero meets girl, villian threatens girl, hero defeats villian, hero gets girl...etc) but this isn't the formula... it's almost the exact plot.Very disappointing, I expected better from him. But he's young and hopefully will mature in his writing as well as his plot devices...However, if you've never seen Star Wars (and if you haven't shame on you, LOL)... you may actually enjoy this not distracted by the obvious connections."
1,Returning it.......so should you,"When my son wanted to return this book to Amazon, I asked him why and we talked about the book. I couldn't believe a book could be published that was so poorly written so I read it myself and was appalled. Glaring errors, disastrous editing, poorly written, poorly organized. Clearly the most overrated book in years. Paolini you've got the last dime you'll ever get from our family of readers. This telephone book should have been trimmed to 1/2 size at the least."
1,Um...?,"I know that a lot of people like this book, but I have to say that I personally thought that both books were really cliche, shame I can't turn down a relative's present.... I found that the basis and plot of the books came from a lot of overused ideas.To me, it falls short on originality and that's what killed the book for me."
1,Terrible,Entertainment Weekly gave it a D+. My hometown newspaper gave it an F. If there was ever a book so undeserving of hype it's this one. No way is it a good book. The only good thing? My dad got me my money back.
4,Eldest is like a good middle,"Very interesting book which gave a lot of insite into the aspects of the journey. I just kept thinking that it was like a lot of other 2nd books in a trilogy, often acting as a filler to the get to the end. Much like ""the Two Towers,"" ""Empire Strikes Back"" & ""Temple of Doom."" You know it is setting it up for a big confrontation at the end. But after Eragon and Eldest, I still recommend the book over the theatrical version."
3,"Good, But...","I like Eldest, right now I'm only halfway through but it's enough to say what I need to say on the book. This story is marvelous. It's creative and unique. However, the problem lies in the telling. In this book and in Eragon, the author used way to many elements of other stories in his book. It's not like he plagerized, far from it. Instead he took ideas, names and places from the best parts of his favorite authors work. Probably the most blatant example is the story of the Melora tree. It's not that it's really a bad thing. It's just that it's indicative of his inexperience and I would like to see what happens once he's had a chance to delve into his own personal fantasies."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I really liked Eragon, let me start out by saying something nice. I was really looking forward to Eldest, but I must say I am disapponted by the book. I understood from where Eragon left off that the plotline of Eldest would take place in Ellesmera. However; I didn't expect that Eragon would spend almost the entire book there. Thank God for the Roran and Nasuada angles, without them the book would have been hopeless. It was dull. With the exception of the last chapters, it was a boring read. And I have to say the plot twists at the end were hardly suprising. I think they would have carried more weight if they had been revealed mid book. The book dragged me along for 600 pages before dropping a ""bombshell"" that I had already guessed. That being said, I am keeping my fingers crossed that the final book of the trilogy will be a more exciting read."
5,"Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2)","As an audiobook listener it was wonderful to hear the story told to me. I am able to form pictures of the people and places of Alegasia in my mind. I highly recommend this book to adults as well as children but you really must read Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1) first so you don't miss out on the entire tale. I am looking forward to the 3rd book in the tale. Christopher Paolini's writing is phenomenal."
3,Don't judge it until you read till the end,"Because of Eragon, my expectation for Eldest is quite high. I do not expect it to be better than Eragon, just equal is OK.It takes me almost 3 weeks to finish this book, while it should be much faster, but the first half of the book is ABSOLUTELY BORING.The explanation, the storyline, and there's something weir about Paolini choice of word. It makes the book more difficult to understand than it should be. (On the bright side, Paolini can make you feel that Eragon journey to Ellesmera is a VERY LONG JOURNEY)But then things get much better on the second half of the book, when Eragon start his training and Roran start to do something more than pity himself.And the graph is pointing upward from there until the end of the book. The excitement, the story, it's all there!So if you plan to throw this book away or sold it to someone else in the first half, hold on a bit longer until you finish it.Then you will know that it is worth your patience."
5,Great read,this book was a great follow on to the first he has written - keeps you at the edge of your seat while it expands on the Kingdom and domain for Eragon and all his 'family'.
3,Ok...,This book was pretty average. It is good if you have nothing else to do. The plot is a bit predectable and flat.
5,Love it,The book arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Am really enjoying reading it.
3,"not bad, but could be great","as with many of the other reviewers, i found the plot to be very predictable...i keep waiting for the author to throw something new or unexpected at me..never happens. i can sum up the next book arya falls for earagon, she gets the last egg and becomes a rider, roran saves his girl somehow...happy ever after. it could be a classic trilogy if it breaks out the all to common mold in fantasy today.oh and the movie has HORRIBLE, hope they remake it, or better yet animate it"
2,Unfortunately Dissapointed,"I am sorry to say that this book is a big upset. Although I didn't enjoy Eragon for taking the ideas of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and DragonRiders of Pern, there was action in the book-- a good dose of it. Up until the final few chapters this book is a bore. If Paolini's writing was better it would be more enjoyable, unfortunately that is not the case.The story was predictable. The unique aspects he did put in (which were rare) had some nice touches. I'm really leaning for a 1.5 star rating. Eragon would have been a 2.5"
5,Great Book,I thought this book was better than the first. I am crazy over fantasy books and this one was perfect to add to my collection. I would suggest this to anyone who is a fan of fantasy.
2,To NAPADOLLY,"For a 54 year old, your review was incredibly immature. In fact, that review would be immature if it were written by an 11 year old. It being written in caps was incredibly childish. However, the worst part is that your arguments were pitiful. How can you accuse negative reviewers of not reading the book? Nearly all of them have well-thought out statements and valid criticisms. Besides, if they didn't read the book, why would they take the time to review?Saying that Eldest is compared to LOTR too often doesn't make that criticism false.Look around: NONE of Paolini's ideas are new. His magic system was stolen from Ursula LeGuin. His Dragon Riders were stolen from McCaffrey. His plot is derived from Star Wars and LOTR. I'd go on, but you should get the point.Thank you, NAPADOLLY, for reinforcing the point that the ones who think Eldest is great and original are either too young or too immature to see its many flaws."
2,The real issue,"I read Eragon, and enjoyed it quite a lot. Then Eldest comes along, and falls into the trap of many sequels.It seems that the author falls in love with the world he created more than the story he was telling. So in Eldest he spends all his time going into exhaustive detail about everything around, to the extent of being boring a lot of the time.He wrote enough story and plot for about 100 pages, not over 600. And some of the dialogue and situations, such as who Eragon would support to run the Varden, are very simplistic, almost childish. The romantic story between Eragon and the elf princess shows that Paolini in real life has never had a girlfriend, since he really proves he doesn't have a clue.I sure hope he does a lot better for the third book, or I'm going to be very burned out on Paolini.Gary Haynes"
2,Weak,"I was very sad with the result of the sequel of ""Eragon"" which was a great book, even though the movie was no good. About 300 of the pages in this book are a waste of time and ink. This book could easily have been 400 pages long and extremely cool, but it became boring halfway through... how unfortunate."
2,well....not the worst book ever,but it is pretty close. ok. having read both books i can say with all honesty and objectivity that compared to other books out their these just are not to good. This book could easily have been cut in half and have been better for it.he is repetitive and fills us in on details that we just don't care about. Paulini tries so hard to gloat about how big his vocabulary is by using words that anyone who took an SAT prep class would know but would otherwise not care about.His cosmology is inconsistant as is his overiding thematic message. he has no idea what he is talking about in his own universe.on top of that his characters do not seem to deal with the situations they are presented in realisticly. i understand that he is writing for kids but so is JK Rowling and she does a great job.this is a childrens book and not worth spending 20 dollars on. maybe if you are bored and have a library card but don't spend money on this stuff.
2,Even the Title Is a Grammatical Error,"First off, the title of this book should be ""Elder."" When you are comparing two things in English, one is the elder and the other the younger. Eldest is only used when there are three or more. So the title is a grammatical error. Nit-picking? Hardly. This single glaring example is indicative of the book's general sloppiness. It shows a disturbing disregard for the reader, I will not say by Paolini, who is, if anything, too earnest, but by his publisher. Given its recycled plot elements and sophomoric prose, the book is a reminder of two things: why teenagers do not generally get their books published and why even the most talented writers need editors. Of course, the author is no longer a teenager, so his writing ought to be getting better. But there is no evidence of such development here. If you must read it because you read the first one, get a copy from the library."
1,0 stars,This book has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. The story is so choppy and hard to follow. By the end you could care less about anyone in the book. Don't get this book save your money.
1,Harry Potter/ Electric Eel smashing?,After carefully reading both Eldest and Harry Potter I have prepared an equation to guide potential readers.Eldest=(Harry Potter)^(1/2)Eldest is the square root of Harry Potter.
1,Looks like the fanatics have a new bullet in their gun.,"There have been many arguments to defend this subpar book and attack honest reviewers. However, we've begun seeing a new one which goes something like this: ""If you like LOTR or Star Wars so much and Paolini stole so much from them, then you must like Paolini."" I'm gonna prove this wrong, though the fanatics are sure to close their ears to me.Each individual author MUST have his own ideas. When we pick up a book that says ""By Christopher Paolini"" on the cover, we want to read a book by Christopher Paolini. We don't want some watered-down LOTR fanfiction. While we want something that ties in to the classics of the genre, we also want something fresh and new. We want to see Paolini contribute to the genre rather than just mimicking other authors and adding nothing new."
1,"Someone take away this kid's keyboard, please!","So he wrote it when he was 15/17. So WHAT? Age is no excuse for bad writing. And believe you me, this is BAD. Is there a single major sci-fi/fantasy book/movie he didn't rip off? Paolini doesn't have an original idea of his own, and oh boy, does it ever show. He hasn't written a ""groundbreaking new fantasy novel,"" he's regurgitated everything he's ever read/seen that he thought was ""cool."" Only the very young reader or the reader new to the genre could mistake this for a good book."
1,GREAT BOOK!.......NOT!!!!!!,"Blah, blah, great book, good book, blah, blah, kiss-up, suck-up, kiss-up. This book is a lame excuse for fantasy fiction...dragon dung."
1,Eldest is a great read,This story is a wonderful read for anyone who can still use their imagination. I believe that Eldest should be read after reading Eragon (book 1) The characters are beleivable and easy to associate yourself with. It is hard to put it down until you reach the end.Bring on Book 3.
5,Sounds Good,"I have been waiting for 3 long months to get this book and I still haven't read the book. From what I have read from the reviews here, are mainly that it was ok. But personally I think that Eldest will be a very good book."
5,Awesome book loved it reccomend it for all.,"This is an awesome book, it is very good. Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter fans will adore this."
2,And then Eragon lightly bounded up the epicly proportionatly steps to his bed.,"Bored yet. Thats what most of the sentences are like. I found myself skipping pages and missing absolutely nothing except Mr. Paolinis wonderful descriptions. When I read Eragon I thought it was okay not great, I didn't like the fact that Paolini copied just about every fantasty book out there. In Eldest though it gets ridiculous. As I was reading I was imagining Gimli, Arwen, and Luke Skywalker strolling through the woods.I have to agree with the others about the editor, this book could have gotten rid of 200 pgs. or so and we would have missed nothing except expandind our vocabulary. I found myself thinking of one of my old english teachers(shudder) I don't need to be reminded of that.Overall Paolinis descriptions reminded me of the enigizer bunny, they kept going and going and going. I'll probably read the third book when it comes out, lets all hope that a new editor comes along. Please."
3,"A little disapointing after the first, but still good.","In my personal opinion, Eragon was much better than this book here. It's kind of a weak follow up to a great series starter, especially with all the high expectations for this book. The main plot was great, but for the most part it was fairly boring. It was mainly 75% talk and 25% action. Not better than the first."
4,so so,i belive that while this may not be the best book you have ever read it is still worth reading. i thought that while the overall plot was better then eragon but it just didnt have that flow to it that made eragon such a huge success. this book does have a few interesting moments like during eragons training and the final battle. but all in all the grand suprise of this book was really predictable in my opinion but still will work out nicely for the next book. i belive that the 3rd book shows promise if he writes it correctly. all in all i am hoping that this book was just building up for the next book. i do not belive it is as good as last but i know many people will like it a lot.
4,Good read - waiting for the 3rd,"I enjoyed it. I read Eragon on an early release to ebooks and have been waiting since then for Eldest. I think this is the 1st time I've started a series where all of the books weren't out. Dang, I hate that! Sure hope #3 doesn't take 2 years!I gave it 4 stars because his writing style needs a little bit of work. That's ok, it takes writers a while to mature. It was a good book. The story line was decent, it sucked me in pretty early, etc. I wouldn't compare him to Tolkien, Orson Scott Card, Lewis, Tad Williams, etc. yet ... but maybe a few books down the road. Hence 4 stars."
1,"UGH! Sicko, Yuck! everlasting boredom!!!!!!!!!!!",what a sicko read. this thing does not even deserve half a star but i had to give it one. you will wast your time reading this so dont because it will bore you to death. i cannot imagine i actually read this .YUCK!!!! if your're looking for awesome fantasy books try Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer or the Stravaganza triology by Mary HOffman. i made my self sick writing this UGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
1,A Chore to Read,"Hmm. I've already reviewed and said it was awful, but there's a point I'd like to make in this ongoing debate:""As for dialogue seeming unrealistic, of course it would be! It's a completely alternate reality from our own, stuck back into a--most likely--feudal society where people saying those sorts of things would be absolutely normal.""Eragon is a farm boy. Would he really be so eloquent in two languages in...what, a year? 18 months? I think most farm boys, even then, would use swear-words and vulgar language, not flowery prose.The preaching of atheism and vegetarianism was lame too, Paolini. If you want people to follow your views, make your books a little more sensible and your characters a lot more 3-dimensional so we know you're worth following. And, before you say, ""That's just because you disagree with my views!"" I am atheist and practically vegetarian."
1,Horrible doesn't begin to describe it,"After reading some of the reviews for Eldest I'm beginning to wonder if this was supposed to be published on April 1 as an april fool's joke. This book reads like an april fool's joke what with the characters being pulled around like puppets and talking like they dropped in from cartoonland.I find it hard to believe any honest to goodness person read and liked Eldest. After rolling my eyes the umpteenth time at this stupipdity of the characters, I gave up. I couldn't even get my kids to read it. In a way, I'm glad my kids didn't read it. No good parent would let their kids read a book where characters are so lacking in values."
1,Rip Off,This poor excuse of a book is a cheap rip-off of other(and far more talented)people's ideas. It is a wonder there hasn't been any law suits.
2,HUGELY disappointing,"I didn't expect much from this book, just a nice fantasy story, pushing further Eragon in his quest...Well I was utterly disappointed reading Eldest. I must confess the book is way too predictable, and it does nothing but dusting off the same old fantasy clichès, or little more. Beside I found the carachters of Sapphira and Eragon REALLY nasty and childish...but I guess that's a matter of personal taste.Though I must praise the side quest of Eragon's step-brother. DEspite not being totally original, it was better written and much more dense with feeling than Eragon's.Finally I'd just point out thet the book is pretty uneventuful, there are few major events (5 I would say)and that's it.C.P. has potential, but I belive he must work more on plot and setting.P.S. Yeah, that's it, settig. Alagaesia is pretty much identical to R.Jordan's world (wheel of time series). And the plot, pardon me, seems too similar to Star Wars'. (I know this sounds ridiculous, but try thinking of it...)"
1,"Painful, frankly.","I tried so hard to like this book; I like Eragon so much! But ultimately, the writing needs work, the plot needs work, and the character development lacks. I give this book one star, only because I can't give it 0. Terribly disappointing."
2,Who's Christopher Paolini?,"Did Tolkien awake from the dead and join forces with Anne McCaffery, Urusula K. LeGuin, and George Lucas? It seems as if those four adopted one common pen name, because at the moment, I can't see Christopher Paolini anywhere.Sure, some LOTR 'fans' of lesser dedication may like these books, but either way, you aren't reading Paolini, you are reading 'watered down' Tolkien plus akward description. Anne McCaffery fans will marvel at her amazing ability to suddenly go from great author of great dialogue to author of shabby lines. Ta-da! See Ursula LeGuin's science of magic corrupted in nothing flat! See Star Wars shoved into shoes much to small for it!So remember to ask yourself ""Who or Where's Christopher Paolini?"" when you read this book, though I advise you not to. I can't find CP anywhere. Can you?"
1,Reprehensible,Entirely disappointing if not plaigerized from Tolkien's work. I'm surprised there aren't any lawsuits over this yet. Clearly the history of dwarves is taken directly from Tolkien. Other entire pages and passages seem to be taken from other sources as well.
1,I agree with most of the negative comments posted before,"Eragon was a decent book. It started off well and ended ok. I was intrigued to read it in first place because it was written by a 15 year old. The first book was good. However, the second book doesn't stand a chance. It reads like it was written by a 15 year old. It starts off exactly where the first book ended. So, you would think it might be worth the read. Well, I lost interest when Roran became so imported, particularly when he hit his future father-in-law. Now, come on... What was Christopher thinking? Roran doesn't seem like a hero to me. It made him look like an immature idiot. As I continue the read (I forced myself), I couldn't believe how perfect the characters were portrayed. I'm mean, they couldn't have one flaw? Children may like it, but it does come close to any fantasy story I have read. Definitely not worth the read!"
3,Neither Here Nor There,"It may not be original, but it is entertaining. I am a fan of dragon mythology and at least Paolini does dragon lore justice.I also recommend Dragon's Milk (Dragon Chronicles)by Susan Fletcher- Some good dragon concepts here as well."
5,Enchanting...,"I believe that every person who has ever wrote a book should recieve respect. These writers pour their thoughts onto pages for others to read. Not everyone is brave enough to let people into their thoughts. Some may think that The Inheritance Trilogy may resemble other works of fiction; however, these books have their own unique story. Christopher Paolini is one of the few authors who can make a fictional language and use it well. I loved the fact that he contained a dictionary of the different languages in the back of the book. It kept me entertained and excited to see what the characters were saying. The books are enchanting and held my attention throughout. I recommend these books to anyone who honestly loves to read, especially fantasy."
4,Eldest,"Although a more slow paced book than Eragon, this enchanting tale takes you on an adventure of your wildest dreams.Eragon must travel lengths to get to the Elven city, Ellesmera.Upon arriving, Eragon is subject to a tutor who is to teach him the ways of the Dragon Riders.All the while, Roran undergoes a battle with the Ra'zac and himself to avenge his uncle.Upon finding the Varden is at war again with Galbatorix's forces, Eragon must take flight to Surda. But when another rider shows, is Eragon ready to fight the forces of evil?"
5,Eldest by Christopher Paolini is the best!,"Eragon and his dragon Saphira are caring and loving not to mention protective characters. But both of them need to learn how to be patient. These two friends also learn who's their enemies and who's family. The plot of Eldest is Eragon and Saphira trying to overcome Galiborex who is evil, in many many fights and wars. While they try to fight him they learn who's there family and who's not. The time is unknown but the place takes place in lots of woods and little towns. The theme of this book is to find true friends and to learn new things everyday.This book was wonderful because it's adventurous and it'll leave you hanging over the edge because you want to know more and that's what makes it good."
2,Disappointing,"This book was very disappointing, especially considering the fun and adventure in its prequel, Eragon. A long portion of the story drags when we read about Eragon's training, something of which I was not interested in reading about. The ending was better (as was Roran's parallel story), but the fact that so much revolved around Eragon's training, I was overall disappointed."
2,Improvement over the first...but that's not saying much,"Eragon was a terribly written book. Full of cliches, flat characters, and an amazing amount of grammatical errors, Paolini failed to impress me. In the second book, Eldest, Paolini makes huge strides as author. Except now he's moved from a child's writing to that of your standard fan fiction author. Eldest doesn't have the grammatical errors anymore, but pushes ahead with deux ex machina, improbable occurrences, and the most vapid love story sequence you'll see since Star Wars II. This is the kind of book you read to laugh at, so check out some passages while at the library or bookstore--just don't pay for it."
5,extroadinarily entrancing and inspiring!!!,"I am a bit disappointed in the reviews of others on this page. I find it so sad that many people would judge Mr. Paolini's latest book on such a scale!My personal opinion of why he switched characters and stories in multiple chapters is that he wanted us to view a perspective of different characters and what was currently going on in other's lives so we would get more out of the story, and I believe that he suceeded.Well done, Christopher! You are a gifted fantasy epic novel writer and a great role model to all!Eldest is an inspiring story, and I think that the idea of boring the readers in the middle of the book just made the ending more exciting! An excellent strategy, I must say."
5,For my Nephew : ),When a child wants to read - you must provide. It was suitable and keeps his interests. Thanks!
5,Fantastic Book!,"I am an adult who loves the Harry Potter books. Then I picked up Eragon and read that, absolutely fascinated by it. The same day I finished Eragon, I bought Eldest, and loved it even more. I do not think the book loses momentum, instead it gets better with every chapter!I also think this book is appropriate for a wide age range. Some of the words used in the book are very advanced, but it will give younger readers a chance to learn them while at the same time giving adult readers a good time.This book has captured my imagination and I would recommend it to everyone!"
2,The product itself.,"Too many reviews on here review the quality of the writing. I found these unhelpful. There are plenty of other ways and better sites to find literary reviews. Chances are, if you're buying this sequel, you want to read it.The product, however, was a poor purchase. It is a small paperback, and is poorly made. The inside margins are so small that there's no way to read the book comfortably; you must stretch the book out to read the end of each line. The day I received my copy, the last 2 chapters fell out due to poor binding. If you choose to read this book, buy some other copy, as this is -- physically -- a poor quality paperback."
2,Boring book two!,"I wouldn't have thought it possible, but this book is even worse than the first one. I don't want to give away spoilers, so instead I will just bash the book. Once again it is super slow paced and boring. This author is more long winded than the Unabomber. Not only did the author manage to make up less of a plot and state the super obvious plot twists, but he made Eragon even more of a Smeg-mah. ""Look at me, I'm Eragon, I caught an arrow and can tell who shot it, but I can't heal myself or beat my brother who has studied magic far less than I have. Oh look, now I am half elf because I got drunk on music at the dance. I think for my final act I shall get owned and cry about it."" Seriously, why does he keep writing these books and why do I keep reading them I hate them?"
3,Disappointing after Eragon...,"I LOVED Eragon. But this one is just dragging. I agree with a lot of the reviewers - the writing is ridiculous at times. I can't stand how slow it is, and it's not really that interesting, it's sort of boring me. I am more than halfway and I can't believe that I am going to put this one down. I am angry that I spent so much time, hoping that it would just get better. What a flop, I had high hopes for Eragon but I won't be finishing the series..."
5,Great Book,Read the book before. My kids seen the movie Eragon and I told them that they had books on them. They asked me to get them so I can help them read the books before they go to bed. Movie doesn't do the book justice. But great choice. My boys love them.
3,Entertaining if anything else,"All in all for a 17 year old author, it's not a bad read. Clever and detailed it's a descriptive read without going over board like Tolkien. You can help but feel bad for the human/dragon duo as they try to find where they fit in and keeping their hormones in check. I can't help but feel that he's putting a little of his personal life in here.Now the one thing I DID NOT like were these cheesy little jokes put in for older readers. In this he shows his inexperience as a writer. I just sat there for a minute and couldn't help but ask what he could've been thinking. But I will say that it's a bad story, it is an entertaining read and that's more than I can say about several books I've read!"
4,Eargon v.s Eldest,"Eldest surpasses any and all expatiations set by Eargon (book 1)A griping continuation of its beloved counterpart Eargon, Eldest is a must read!!"
1,A Awesom Buk!,"I luvd this buk. It was relly intresting and exiting. There were magical fling dragons. Then a gy namd Aragon lik in Lord of the Rings fond a dragon and it hached and then Aragon namd it Safira lik the diamond. Then he flis with Safira and fites a battle. Then he goz to the elfs and falls in luv. The luv seens are very tuching. The elf that he fals in luv with is namd Arya, like Arwen in Lord of the Rings. But then she hats him and he is sed. Then Aragon fites and losses. But his enmey is acually his bruther and then Aragon duzn't dy. But then Aragon meets his other bruther, Roran, who is like Rohan in Lord of the Rings. Then thy kis and mak up and evryon is hapy. This buk had a lot of gud plots. It was rely long but ther wernt any extra detials to mak it borig. The charrcters were livly and fresh and orginal. The plot was to. I luvd it.P.S. (Sarcasm)"
1,Stupid me...,Stupid me I still bought it even though I knew it was gonna stink. Everyone in this book walks around and does dumbheaded stuff and talks like idiots. Never again. No more Paolini books for me.
1,Don't even bother,"After reading the reviews of Eragon and this book I was really excited and couldn't wait to order them. Even though they cost more than twice as much as the other books I normally read, I thought it would be worth it. I had recently read ""Tales of Otori"" series by Liam Hearn and was looking forward to an exciting fantasy adventure.I made it through Eragon after a lot of effort to make myself continue reading because I kept thinking that the book is going to get better. I made it through a few hundred pages of Eldest thinking the same thing. But it never gets better! The plot and the character's motivations are incomprehensable, the characters are flat which makes it difficult to care about any of them. Suffice to say I won't ever read any more books by Paolini."
5,amazing,i am really happy with reading this book on my kindle its the best investment i have made and i so love reading xo
5,Eldest,"Fantastic sequel, full of action and emotion. Christopher Paolini is a god with a pen! Cant wait to read his other works"
4,great story but a little lengthy,"this book was a little long and a little too detailed that by the time i was through with it i couldnt remember the beinnning but it was overall a great read, and i NEVER got bored with it. i would reccomend this and i cant wait for the third!!!!"
5,Eldest book review,"Book was received in excellent condition. I was really impressed! It was brand new, wrapped in clear wrap. I spent half of what the bookstore price was. My daughter has already finished reading it! I have recommended ""used books"" to several people who were suprised that it even exists. Thanks."
3,"More original than the first, but still...","This book was slightly more original than the first and didn't copy off Tolkien quite as much (it still did, but there was nothing new), but even as someone who hasn't seen Star Wars I can tell it took a plot twist from that. Also, I find Eragon's relationship with Oromis COMPLETELY copied from The Giver. I advise every potential buyer of this book to stay away and read Tolkien instead."
1,Book not as described,"This book was described as very good(not good). To me this means there will be no major problems with the book, but may show some signs of wear. Well this book had a hole and tear in the front cover. Very disappointed, because it is a Christmas gift!! If they would have described as ""good"", then I would have known there may have been issues with the book & I would not have bought as a Christmas gift."
4,Lot of info,Book is filled with alot of training. Does more than makes up for it by splitting the book with another character. Has to be done the story needs this info. Kind of slow till second charater roars in. Ending is epic. A must read for all fantasy fans.
4,Loved it even if I guessed the ending,I couldn't put it down even though I guessed the ending right. Wasn't so up on the training sessions but I found what everyone else was doing quite interesting. The series looks to be set up thus far like the Lord of the rings with the middle book breaking apart the main players and having them come back together in the end. It was fun and light.
5,Wonderful Book For Youngsters,"Bless Chistopher Paolini's heart! My ten year old sondevoured Eragon and was pining for Inheritance tobe published. These books are fun, smart, and full of wonderfulstorytelling. In a marketplace overloaded with so-sobooks cranked out for young kids, Paolini emerges asthe real deal. Highly recommended for kids that like Tolkein,Harry Potter series, fantasy and just plain great stories."
3,Fantasy in flight,"Enjoyable to follow the progress of Eragon and his half brother.Lovely shocks at the end when you start to find out whos who.Better than the first book, but would never stand up on its own."
4,Starwars episode V: The empire strikes back,Still I just cannot believe how funny this is! next thing you know lightsabors wil be popping out of no where and wookies will come in and dance! but it is a good read. i cannot put it down! I would reccomend theese to about anyone!
5,Phenominal,"It is an excellent book! The author is amazing to be writing such a wonderful and imaginary book at such a young age! I had a hard time putting it down. I did see the influence of J.R.R.Tolkien and others ,however there was enough of Paolini,s own imagination to make it a wonderful and different story to be told and read. I look forward to the last book of the trilogy. Sandra Holt"
4,Eldest ( Inheritane. Book2),"Everything a Fantasy-Fiction book should be, with lots of magic, beautiful elves, grumpy dwarves, and of course the heros of the story, Eragon the dragon rider, and Saphira his magical dragon and best friend. This was easy, fun reading that came to the end of the book too soon. Can't wait till the the third book comes out!!!~"
5,PRINTING ERROR WARNING!!!!!,"I received two NEW copies of this book published by Alfred A. Knopf. After page 236, there were pages from ANOTHER story (the sequel to Inkheart). and there are about 100 pages of the Eldest story missing.BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
2,Boring and Dull,Eldest is the second part of Eragon. It's about Eragon going to train with the elves. It also says what has happened to Roran. The book is a lot longer then it needs to be. It didn't to hold my attention. I only read a few chapters before setting it aside. The story dragged on with very little action. Unless you really like the first book I don't think it's worth buying.
5,"Gripping tale, well written, worthy sequel","Let me say outright, that if anyone was sick of reading about elves and dragons, I do not know why they bought the first book in the series. Just get over it, and don't spoil everyone else's enjoyment.Having heard all of the cynical stuff about similarities with Star Wars etc, I didn't think I was going to be able to enjoy ""Eldest"". However, I think that the ""Star Wars"" similarities are, after all, a little far-fetched. It smells to me of tall-poppy syndrome.I was gripped by the end of the first chapter, and read, and read for two days whenever I had spare time. I loved the tale, and can't wait to re-read it. It's a very satisfying read.Of course it doesn't have the same depth of ""Lord of the Rings"". Give the author a break! Tolkien was preparing his background material for LOTR for, what, 20 years? That said, Eldest is still an excellent quality story, well worth the money.I'm looking forward to the conclusion."
1,Awesome Read!!!,"I picked up this book about a week after it came out and it is AWESOME!!! I read Eragon about a year ago, recommended to me by a good friend of mine, and I loved it. Eldest has a different meaning in it, a different plotline. I liked how the book frequently switches off between Eragon and Roran, and sometimes Nasuada. It gives the book a taste much like Artemis Fowl. At the end, there is a mindblowing secret which will make you want the next book as soon as possible. WAY TO GO, PAOLINI!!! 5 stars!"
3,"Still good, but slower than the first","I really enjoyed the first book in this series, but found it a little slow. This book was more of the same. There are not enough action scenes in a book of this length to satisfy me. With that said, I completely enjoyed the book and I agree with other reviewers who say that learning about the elves and dwarves adds valuable context to the series. I also think that learning about Eragon's training, where he fits into the history of the riders and hearing about what is expected of him in more detail is valuable. It could have been done more concisely, but worth reading anyway.I also enjoyed reading about Roran, but found myself trying to read through these sections quickly to get back to Eragon and Saphira's story. These sections, in particular, could have been written more concisely.Even though the book is longer than it has to be, it is still a very enjoyable read for those who like this type of book, and you have to read this one if you enjoyed the first."
5,The Eldest: Alagaesia has my heart...,"I thought Eragon was a great book, but this one drug my heart through the mud. The adventures of Eragon continue to swell with time and destiny as the rest of Alagaesia struggles to survive. I didn't expect to become so attached. I am looking forward to the next book. This series is a must-read for young readers and fantasy lovers."
4,Not as good as the first,"Ok, I admit it was not as good as the first, but the end of the book was awsome. The second book,or movie, in a trilogy is always not as good. It had its good parts, and bad. Over all I give it a 4. Don't lose hope in Paolini yet people."
4,Good setup for the 3rd book,"Eldest is a good read, a few slow spots, but all in all a good book. It gives background on the main characters and sets you up for the 3rd book."
4,Amazing yet not perfection,"Personaly I Have not seen the best book ever. Though this is right in line. Paolini seems to have a knack for writting even at the age of 17. For many of the books ""haters"" people seem to forget that. Yes the book seems to have woven in some of the plots of many of our favorites (star wars, toklien) yet its great. Im hooked and so are millions. Plus the movie rights have been bought. No i can not say it worth of 5 stars as i am a firm beliver of 5 stars means PERFECTION but no its no 1 star either."
1,Amateurly written,"With all the popularity of the books I expected more. But unlike books like The King's Blade and The Crystal Shard this book drags. The narrative made it hard for me to stay awake, there were unresolved issues and all of it was far too predictable.If you're looking for a fun read, try the books above especially The King's Blade, both are definitely far better than this one."
4,Better than expected,"I wasn't pleased with the Eragon movie, so to fill in the holes I bought the book which was better, and then decited to read the second book too. I was pleased with this addition, you learn more about the elves and I really got pulled into the story this time. A good buy. Can't wait for the third book."
2,Whatever,"I wasn't in love with Eragon, but I thought I would read the second book anyway. I needed something to do over spreing Break anyway. Well, this book was boring and it felt like I already read it somewhere before. Oh yeah, in every other fantasy book ever written.Save yourself a headache and try a different series."
2,my point of view,"Eldest is an adventure-fantasy book. I'm halfway into the book and this is my point of view. I don't think it's better than Eragon but it's ok. It's not very easy to read. The book has a lot of hard words. The sentences don't make you understand those words too easily. I was disappointed when Ajihad died.(He was the leader of the Varden) He was slaughtered by urgals. I think Saphira was one most important characters. Saphira is the most important character because she helps Eragon everyway. Maybe this is a summer reading book, because it takes a long time to read."
1,This book belongs in Yawnsville Arizona,"In books there's boring, really boring, and incredibly boring. But this book is über-boring. It's beyond the tedium event horizon. It's broken the barrier of boredom. It's so incredibly and unbelieveably dull that it has to be read to be believed.But you probably shouldn't read it anyway. Not if you value your sanity, anyway."
2,Poorly written,Overall a bad expirience. The two books seem like they were written by different people. There was almost no movement of plot in the book just lots of character development which he constantly does not stick too. This was a hard book to stay interested in. I am not impressed by this poor writing style.
2,"My daughter loved it, I hated it","Epic fantasy is new to my daughter. So all the cliched characters and situations, all the contrived plot devices, even the poor writing style, didn't matter - it was all new. She had never read anything like it before and was swept away by the sheer scope of the book.It piqued her interest, and she is now devouring fantasy books from far better authors. For that reason alone it gets two stars, rather than one."
4,I WISH PEOPLE WOULD STOP SAYING HOW BAD THESE BOOK IS!!,"I have know idea why people think this book stinks or is poorly writen. Personaly I think some people are just jealous because Paolini is so young and becoming popular. I think he did an awsome job for his age and I think his books are great. I can't beleive someone his age would come up with all he did like the different languages he made and just the whole plot. Also, the way he writes keeps you in suspence and it makes you want to read more. Overall these books are really good especially for the fantasy lovers."
5,Eldest was even better than I expected,"What a wonderful story, I couldnt hardly put the book down!! Now, when will part three be available????"
2,Much Worse Than The First,"Eldest was bad. Eragon was MUCH better than this. All Eldest was about is Eragon's training and that's basically it. If it weren't for Roran, the whole middle of the book could be thrown out with no regrets from anyone. The middle part was so boring it took me three months just to get from 259 to 400! Paolini really screwed up on this. The only thing Eragon ever did was, feel the forest, in training. SO STUPID!The Good:The ending battle, and Roran's part.The Bad:Everything else.Another bad thing was that if you mix Lord of the Rings and Star Wars together, you get this. At least Eragon had more originality.People who haven't read this, just read the ending. It's the only good part."
2,A watered down story that tries too hard.,"The book is full of bad dialogue, illogical events, and sloppily written prose. In short, this book is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. There are about 10 pages of anything interesting out of 704.Trust me, folks, this is all nonsense. Has this guy ever even taken English 101??Save your money."
2,A disappointing follow-up,"As an adult reader, I was pleasantly suprised with Eragon. I thought Paolini would improve his writing and his trilogy would get better with each book. That didn't happen. I made it about a 1/3 of the way through Eldest and had to stop reading. The story was plot driven and boring. Characterization was lacking, and the dialogue seemed forced."
2,Disappointment,"eldest was a disappointing read compared to eragon. true, it is a well sized book and looks impressive; however, this does not make up for the choppy content. Roran's ""quest"" was unclear and quite lame. Eragon's training and adventures were also a bit boring. I had to read it for school, and the few days it took to finish were slow. This is why I give eldest the 2 star rating it deserves. I hope paolini's next book in the inheritance is one much better than the 2nd one."
1,You've got to be kidding me...,"Stupid sucker me. I bought Eldest without reading the reviews. If I had read the reviews I never would have bought it. Everyone hates this book, and for good reason. For me JUST SAY NO means no more Paolini books. Anyone reading it must be stupider than me cause this books stinks."
2,"Hard to Read, but Hoping Paolini finds His Stride","It's awesome that Paolini has been successful in getting published when many good writers don't. I absolutely hope he refines his style and goes on to write the best books I've ever read. But this one is a low point so far.I suppose all the elements of his story are not original, but that doesn't bother me so much. And I think the truth is that most others wouldn't mind it so much either except for the writing itself. The problem that keeps making me want to throw the book down is that the writing itself is just ... clunky! It doesn't flow very well. He uses the words ""which"" and ""the fact that"" an awful lot along with many other phrases that just don't flow very well. It's hard for me to describe, but you will know it when you read it. It just doesn't settle into you easily. So rather than enabling the story, the words he uses actually get in the way."
1,mind blowing,"We have a thousand monkeys with typwriters randomly typing things. Eldest is coming. ETA 36 minutes.A blatant ripoff of everything, covered up with really long Norwegian sounding names and symbols that should be reserved for chemicals. Du Waldenvarden? Bless you. Of course, some names are just silly. Come, Galbatorix! Asterix, Obelix, and Vitalstatistix are waiting for you! Oh yes, and syntax. From this century that is. Language is supposed to E-volve.I comfort myself that at least the storyline is orignally from The Wheel of TIme. Oh, whoops.The one thing I do find amazing is that Paolini, who lives in Nowhere USA and probably has never seen alcohol or women before, is miraculously able to describe their effects... in the same way every other Tor fantasy novel does. Has somebody been stealing his experiences along with his plots? Stick to describing moss, kid."
2,Not worth it,"Eragon was an ok read, though not too well written and with the plot obviously taken from a variety of books and movies currently out there. However, some parts I liked, and it kept me turning the pages.Eldest though, did not impress me.The writing certainly hadn't improved, and it was much too long, making it an even duller read than Eragon. It should have been much shorter, not to forget that I would have expected better than what the book turned out to be from a writer of his age.Also, the editor deserves a whack on the head."
1,eragon and eldest the best rip off ever?,Am i the only one who thinks eragon is basically walking eyebrows because you never really get an idea of what he looked like exept he has slanted eyebrows.the book i must say was okay like star wars lord of the rings and dragon riders of pern condensed into one. it even had a luke i am your father momemt with murtugh and the mary sue character eragon this book was great cause it saved me reading dragon riders of pern and lord of the ring.totally ok not rubbish just okay boring too and unoriginal dragons have been done to death as have elves and drawfs not to mention the farm boy becomes almighty god you never fear for them whatsoever i gave this book 1 star only because it saved me some time on the lord of the rings and dragon rider books
1,Lemmings?,"I'm not sure why everyone like this. The writing and the story are mediocre at best, and a lot of the ideas have been used much better in other books."
4,good readin,"Eldest is a book with humans, dragons, elves, dwarves. There are battles with weapons and magic. A boy named Eragon who became a rider now has to travel to Ellesmera with his dragon Saphira. He becomes more powerful and stronger at a festival where he is turned into an elf. He fights alongside with the Varden against the empire and their ultimate doom might have just come when he sees what happens.In the middle of the book, Eragon learns new techniques for battling and using magic. He becomes stronger and much smarter. He also meets a rider and a dragon. They are amazed because he thought that him and Saphira were the only dragon and rider left.I liked this book because it was very interesting and it was an adventure book and I like adventure books. This book was a fantasy book. If you like adventure and action books this would be a good book for you. It is a middle and high school level book."
5,Great!,"This book is the sequel to the book Eragon, also a good book. Eldest is a very good book because it employs a good plot, love and memorable characters all into one great story. This an astoundingly good book as it draws the reader in, enticing them to delve further into the book. I highly recommend this book, as it is one of the most highly detailed books I've ever seen."
2,Slow and Annoying Spinoffs,"Honestly, it was a disappointment. The first book was pretty alright. But this one was more of a rushed work with stolen plotlines from lord of the rings, star wars, etc. It was slow moving with many pointless chapters that did little to progress the story. Character developments were little. Arya became more annoying and has no tolerance for different beliefs. Eragon became more pathetic and emotionally weak. The elves and dwarves were spinoffs of Tolkien's works. The best part was the end when Murtagh, the only decent character was brought back. A book that you may read once and will never want to look at it again."
4,Good Book,"It's a good book if you like books that involve dragons, middle earth, and adventure. It has a little bit of everything in it. I usually don't read books but when I bought and read this I was shocked that i read the whole thing."
2,Leaves me flat,"The first book was good enough for me to continue on onto this one. To tell the truth, much of it was enjoyable. I found that the focus on training and description drawing me into the world, and with each new chapter I kept saying to myself ""Huh, I didn't expect that"". The characters of Saphira and Roran develop nicely. But I don't know, somewhere around 2/3 into it I stop hearing the characters giving well thought out reasons for their actions, descriptions of the world stop feeling so detailed, and I can feel the author shoving the plot along to the end. Then the ending was kind of ho-hum. I don't see me reading the last book."
5,this book series is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i enjoyed this book series alot this book series is amazing this author is one of my all time favorite authors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Author Needs to Grow Up,"While I found ERAGON to be an entertaining first effort, I could not get through more than two chapters of ELDEST. The author tells everything that is happening and what the characters are feeling in tedious expository, rather than allowing the descriptive imagery, action and dialogue to move story forward. I had hoped that Paolini's style would have matured since his first book."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I have just reread all the reviews, now that I have finished the first two books for myself, and I'm mystified by all the glowing praise. I'm a long-time fantasy and scifi fan, but this just didn't grab me. I found the characters flat, unengaging, and frankly uninspiring. The events were difficult to follow, and unfold more as after the fact this is what's been going on rather than taking you along to discover it for yourself. There was no sitting on edge of the seat waiting the next revelation it was more like riding in the back seat asking ""are we there yet?"" ""is it over yet?""I understand there will be a third book, but I won't be bothering with it."
2,Just dull,"Paolini is a prodigy, no doubt, but he isn't a very gifted writer. Much of what he wrote in the first book was synthesized from other fantasy stories and from those elements he crafted a fairly interesting, albeit longwinded, tale. It's my opinion that his editors (if he has any) should've cut out at least one-third of Eragon.With that said, reading Eldest was like slogging through mud. It was so incredibly convoluted and just plain dull that I gave up midway and have no desire to go back and find out what I missed. I couldn't care less.I think his problem is that he and his parents are so impressed with whatever he writes that they don't suggest massive editing. If they do, then it doesn't show. Eragon was ok, Eldest was boring, and I'll skip Brisingr altogether."
1,Is it possible to give less than one star?,"Nobody should have to endure writing this bad. It's like someone watched Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Willow, ate some nachos, and then went to sleep and had a bad dream...and this is what came out. I can't believe I wasted so much time on this.Really? Yes, really. I think if Paolini's mother were not a publisher and had the connections to get this book pushed through to publication as well as the marketing gimmick that her son is a teenage writer, this book would never have seen the light of day...and a forest of trees would be happier for it.Unfortunately, Paolini has since seen fit to continue his bad writing, increasing the length of this dumb idea by turning a trilogy into a quadrilogy...the phrase ""cruel and unusual"" comes to mind. Fortunately, I do not have to read them."
5,A great in the series,I bought this book for my son and he loves it. He already read Eragon and Eldest has left him wanting more from the series of books. A well written book that plays on the idea of fantasy and life.
3,"Good, but not as good.","First of all before anything, I LOVE (and still do) ERAGON!I thought it was an incredibly imaginative book. When I first started reading Eldest, I had very high hopes for the same kind of writing style. As I got farther into the book I could tell that it wasn't the same at all. It lacked the origonality that Eragon had.Some details I though were totally dumb. Like the one-way romance between Arya and Eragon. Stupid! If you're going to write something like that, at least make it worth while to read the part! If you're looking for a great romance novel, BACK OFF FROM THIS BOOK!!!!While I like Eldest okay, I don't love it. It might be the lowest on my top ten favorite books."
2,Weaker than the first,"I just finished reading Eldest over the weekend. I found it plodding. I can't help but agree with the Star Wars analogies. Also, it appears that Paolini took Philosophy 101 class in college and included several of the trite reason v. faith arguments. Paolini wrote as if his readers can't spot or understand a faulty syllogism when they see it. Please, leave that nonsense out in the next book and write an adventure story like Eragon. I'll keep reading, but for those still considering this book, get it from the library ."
1,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,"all i have to say is: I CANT BELIEVE THIS PIECE JUNK WAS ACTUALLY PUBLISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yewww! PAOLINI (WHAT EVER HIS NAME IS) WAS TRYING TO MAKE THIS BOOK SOPHISTICATED AND FANCY BUT INSTEAD SUCCEEDED IN RUINING IT ENTIRELY! SERIOUSLY, WHO WANTS TO READ A BOOK WHERE EVER OTHER WORD IS ABOUT 15 LETTERS LONG? if you want to read some quality books read the Stravaganza triology! Go Stravaganza!"
4,Great book,I must admit the beginning was very slow and it kind of dragged buy on Eragons part. However Rorans part was great and it kept me reading. By the end I was happy I kept at it because the end was awesome. It was the best part of the book. It had a very big suprise and twist and I didnt want to stop reading. Dont listen to the critics who say this one is bad. Get it and read it and you'll be happy. =)
5,A Fun Read,"For those of us who just enjoy reading, Eragon and Eldest are a fun read. I appreciate how Eragon's character has grown since the beginning and have been thoroughly engrossed by the action. Sure . . . I recognize some of my favorite stories living within this series, but I didn't enjoy it any less as a result. I can't wait for the 3rd book!"
2,Who says we're jealous?,"I thought a previous reviewer had summed this up. Not all of us our jealous. Not all of us are teenagers that want to be published. Sorry, some of them might be, but saying that we are all jealous of Paolini's success is an overstatement.After all, what do you deem success? The amount of money that fills you pocket? Is success writing a boring novel and making big 'bling' off it? Is it getting a ton of attention? I personally would say that a novel that sells two copies is more of a success story than Eldest. Eldest is only 'sucessful' because it is hanging off the tail of Eragon, a better book, not like that is hard to achieve.I didn't come here to flame Paolini. That would be waste of a dragon's breathe, just like Eldest wastes the dragon story that was Eragon.Again, what do I have to be jealous of? Eragon, maybe if I liked writing, but Eldest? I would never stoop so low."
1,Shockingly Poor Content and B O R I N G !,"This hardcover cover version is not costly but a major source of headache. After reading Eragon I was anticipating Eldest to be a good read. But, alas, Paolini thinks he is Charles Dickens or something and has tried and failed miserably to put his latest offering into the realm of classics. Poor Poor! I won't recommend this book at all for anything except throwing it into the bin, I really hope he reads this review and writes the last book better.Mediocre to very poor book!"
1,There's a reason so many people hate this book...its bad,"I have been reading fantasy my whole life, and am pretty darn open minded. When I saw the great rating Eragon had, I bought both Eragon and Eldest on the spot. I was really disappointed though when my family and I tried read this. Dull, mindnumbingly boring, and that's just the beginning. I am not one of those people that has to have action all the time, but this is pure stupdity."
1,Boring,"This book was REALLY BORING. I have ""A"" student, book loving (even Eragon loving) friends who read about 18 chapters and then called it quits because they were so bored. The descripions wander and leave you wondering what Paolini was trying the describe. *spoiler* Also at the end when Murtagh tells Eragon they are brothers, Eragon denies it and then what does Murtagh say? ""Search your feelings, you know it to be true!""Pop in Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back and you will see Vader telling Luke the EXACT same thing! Other reviewers have pointed out many other striking similarities between Eldest and Star Wars. Paolini is a copier!Don't waste your time or money on Eldest - buy Star Wars instead for the same story but with much more entertainment value!"
5,simply amazing!,I am thoroughly impressed. After I started to really get into it I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it!
1,I am speechless.,"Absolutely ridiculous. I cannot imagine how such a cliched and boring pile of nonsense was even published. After reading the disappointing Eragon, I had hoped that the author's sadly misguided style would have improved, but I was terribly mistaken. This is an insult to Tolkien (which is blatanly ripped off of in both books) and every other notable book in the fantasy genre. The dialogue is not natural. It is constructed and awkward. The plot and events have been done a million times over (and much better executed, too). The characters are terribly cliche, and I feel no sympathy for them. The villain is boring and predictable, as are the heroes. The creatures show little imagination, and are not very well devised. The only redeeming quality about this book is the front cover art. Unfortunately, that's not enough to warrant a buy from me. In short, just don't touch this book. I'm sure whatever story you can imagine in your mind will be loads better than the real thing."
3,"bummer, wrong performer!","now that i look closely, i can see that this version of eldest is read by someone other than Mr. Doyle. Wouldn't have ordered it if I had noticed that before I ordered. That might be a good thing to make clear in the description. But it's in good shape and arrived in a timely manner."
1,Please don't Preach.,"Maybe you can chalk it up to second book let down, but this was far weaker than Eragon, slow moving and verbose like there was a word count to fulfill. The part that bothered me was the attempt to say that the lowest bug and man were in reality of the same value. This on it's face may be likened to the beliefs of Hinduism, but that too is crushed by the assertion that anyone that is really enlightened does not believe in God. The book also states that one who is enlightened will not eat the flesh of another living being. It then goes on to give plants a low level of awareness, I wonder why the enlightened are allowed to eat at all."
1,It's bad because it's bad,"Blaming the publisher now for this mess of a book, you cannot be serious?! It's not the fault of the changing viewpoints either-that's the one thing I didn't hate about this clunker. At least there were more characters to hate this time. Seriously the worst book I've ever read!!"
1,Why Rave?,"I am unimpressed. This is only the 2nd book I have failed to finish in my life. I only got through about 1/2 of the book. While Eragon was mindnumbing and utterly boring, Eldest is a disaster. I'd rather go to the dentist and have new holes drilled in my mouth than continue reading it. I was VERY unimpressed with the writer. I will avoid his books in the future. He doesn't seem to have even the most basic writing skills. You'd have to be pretty desperate with nothing else going on to want to read this."
3,Entertaining but no classic,"I voractiously read and perhaps the timing was just ""right"" for me to pick up both Eragon and Eldest over the past week. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the story in Eragon and eagerly picked up Eldest to continue the ride.Unfortunately, I think that Eldest fails it's predecessor by spending too much time in alternate storylines which pale to the central storyline of Eragon and Saphira. I found the Roran plotline exceedingly plodding - to the point of actually skipping chapters to get back to Eragon and Saphira.Perhaps book 3 of the trilogy will round the series out and clean up the entirely too loose ends of Eldest, but I feel that maturity and experience of the author are what's holding him back. Clearly a great start to a career, but by no means would I compare him or these works to Tolkien or Asimov."
3,Simply stated,"a fantasy book for adolescents that has had extensive PR/Marketing applied to selling it to adults as well. There is nothing special here, hackneyed plotline, flat dialog, cookie cutter characters...many fantasy books out there similar to it written by 43 year olds. If your looking for safe, reliable, predictable fantasy plotlines than this book is for you and you will enjoy it otherwise save your money."
1,You call that a book?,"""Sé onr sverdar sitja hvass!""-may your swords stay sharp. That is the lamest book I ever read. Talk about characters dieing Ajihad was not supposed to die! And this book is much much worse then Eragon. A lot of this comprehendible espacilly of the flips from the point of view that take place (Eragon to Roran to Ajihad's daughter). Augh! that mess me up so mech. If I have on word to describe Eldest and Christopher Paolini it would be pitful. He just did a horrible job from the different languages to keeping the readers attention. Well, if you did't read it I suggest you don't read it. If you read I apologies."
5,The best book since trilogy since Tolkein!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Eldest has everything any loyal fantasy reader would adore. The high vocabulary shouldn't be a challenge if you read and comprehended Tolkein. This book is excellent! I can't wait until the third book in the trilogy comes out. For those people with low vocabulary, don't read this book and write a review, complaining about your own incompetence. I'm sorry if this is offending, but it is my own opinion. This book compares to Tolkein, and Starwars the most (both of which I greatly enjoyed). For this fact I did not mind the intertwining of them. I greatly enjoyed this book and strongly reccomend it to anyone with a high vocabulary, and a like for Tolkein and Starwars."
5,Eldest,"I have two words that describe this book: Secrets Revealed. Action, romance, you name it, all in this book. -Brannon"
2,Eldest < Expectations,"WARNING: SPOILERSLike Eragon, Eldest had quite a few unoriginal things in it (mostly things from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings). However, Eragon held up far better than Eldest. Things got very boring during Eragon's training, and by now most of the few interseting or decent characters had died or disappeared (Brom, Murtagh) or just weren't in the book enough (Roran). The last battle could've been great, but it took away from the book that Eragon was a ""superman"" by this time and was killing off people without moving a finger. Roran salvaged the book as best he could, but one character can do only so much."
4,Great book,"I read Eragon and decided to get Eldest. It's a great book, very enjoyable read. I can tell the author is older now, because of how it is written. I highly recommend this book. Enjoy!!"
4,"Wasn't as exciting as ""Eragon"" but was just as captivating","I REALLY liked ""Eldest""! It took me 26 days to finish it, but it was a very enjoyable read. I will warn you that it is much easier to put down than ""Eragon"" and the most exciting parts are at the begining and at the very end of the book. There are quite a few suprises in it and a lot a questions that were asked in the first book are answerd. Somebody said something about the book being scary, but I didn't think so. But, I woundn't recomend letting a ten year old who's afaid of the dark, read it. I strongly suggest that you read ""Eragon"" before you read this book. That way you will undestand it better. I really enjoyed ""Eldest"" and if you liked Eragon, I'm sure you'll like ""Eldest"" as well."
3,good but rip off...,"It took me a long time to read it, which is strange for me. It was kind of slow to get moving, and not a lot of action scenes. Halfway through it I felt even more like I was rereading a mimick of Lord of the Rings. Toward the end of the book I felt like I was watching Star Wars, only a weak version of it. None of the characters were orginal, just mimicks of LOTR's and Star Wars characters also. I kept wanting to call orik, gimli.Over all I have to say, if you made it through the first one, you might as well read this book and probably the third one. But be pepared to be somewhat dispointed."
2,Lacking,"What do I mean by lacking? Well.... When I read this book I was in fourth grade and had alot of hope. I had read Eragon, and it was simply mediocre (sp?) But I had heard such great reviews and I decided to give it a chance. What I found was the typical fantasy book. A little too typical. When I heard Paolini was stealing from other authors, I didn't believe it. But, alas, the evidence is staring me right in the face.I wanted to like this book, I really did. It was my dream to become a writer, and this guy was only fifteen. I think he could use some more experience...It was so predictable. I would read something, and groan, wondering how I didn't see that coming. Not to mention the lack of leading ladies.Worth reading? Nope. I know there are alot of hardcore Eragon fans out there, and this is just my opinion."
5,Eldest (Inheritance Book 2),"Eldest is even better then ""Eragon (Book 1)"". Can't wait for Book 3 to come out."
3,the story continues,"I would buy this book to keep up with the story line in hopes that the third book is better. While it is't as good as the first book, it isn't horrible either."
5,Great Follow up to Eragon,"I really enjoyed this book. It follows Eragon though the ""adolecent"" part of the story. After leaving Farthen Dur, he goes and trains with the elfs. At the Same time, paolini follows the stories of Roran and Nasuade. Full of twists and surprises, this book is hard to put down!"
4,Inheritance,This is a great follow up to Eragon. I can't wait for the third book of the Inheretance trilogy.
3,"Pretty good, but overhyped","I'm enjoying this book after finding it slow at the start, but it's comical how much the author is trying to imitate Tolkein. It's also no surprise at all that the author was still a teenager (or perhaps 20?) when he wrote this book. Nary a sentence lacks an adjective, or four.Anyway, I'm still reading after 500 pages, so that's worth 3 stars. Just don't expect it to be the second coming of anything. It's not even as well-written as the (of course even more over-hyped) Harry Potter series."
3,Good book I guess,"I liked this book except for a few things:1. The fact that eragon's side of the story is boring for the first half of the book anyway.2. Everyone keeps saying ""aye""3. It has some wierd scenes4. The characters seem to overeact sometimes5. Resembles Star Wars, but less than in Eragon6. Eragon and Arya*thier scenes seem rather fake."
3,I can do better then this any day of the week !,"for me the book was good , but Christopher Paolini relly should have cut this book douwn at lest the very lest 400 pags.I think that the story is good, but Christopher Paolini just relly didn't do a good job of keeping the reader intreest though out the book, he terid to go in to way to many directions, and the directions that he did go in weren't Interesting they there just takeing up more room. so i think that Christopher Paolini thinks he much better they he is, but that not to say that he doesn't have talent, I just think i have more, and that the only talent that Christopher Paolini has is to come up a book that is so obviousley a copy of lord of the rings and star wars. and a one more thing, the parts of the book that Christopher Paolini did copy for lord of the ring were complety Unnecessary, it was just as if Christopher Paolini was purposly tring to make he's books like the lord of the rings .joshua.b"
1,Why Rave?,"As with Eragon, a friend of mine wrote a review of Eldest that magically disappeared. Funny how only reviews that promote this book in some way make it. Enough already!!On with the review, this book not the stupendious epic that I expected. I do like well written fantasy and I am not sure why this one is being praised so highly. The writing and the story are mediocre at best, laughable at worst. It was very slow and boring. Nothing happens in the entire book except people traveling around. Save your time and money."
4,awesome,"Wow between Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, Eragon, and Tucker O'Doyle, these are wonderful days to be a fan of good quality fantasy novels!"
5,awesome,this book is awesome and is action packed. Also there are alot of suprises thaat keep the book interesting
2,Homeschoolers...,"I'm not here to make a stand or point. All I ask, is that you leave homeschoolers out of your arguments.NOt all of us are unsociable geeks who never see the light of day. I am involved in all kinds of stuff and act like a normal human being, yet I am still homeschooled.Someday, I hope to be a published author. So please, if you see that I am a homeschooler, I would like a chance for being my own person, and not the common opinion.Thank you for your time. Beat up Paolini as much as you want; I could care less. Just leave us homeschoolers out of it!Natalie"
1,Snore - Don't Bother,"I've read fanfics better written than this. Where the heck were the editors? When people say: ""it's in the image of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars,"" what they really mean is: ""It's a cheap knockoff."" While ""Eragon"" was decent, ""Eldest"" bored me to tears. The characters were one-dimensional and bland, their emotions stereotypical in the extreme. For a classified-as-young-adult book, it reads as though Paolini swallowed a thesaurus and the obscure words take away from the story as a whole. The storyline is ""Star Wars"" with a few changes to avoid copyright issues and a little ""Lord of the Rings"" for good measure; it's simple and extremely predictable... Hopefully book 3 is better."
4,"What can I say, it lived up to the first one","Again, this was a family favorite. We enjoyed the way Christopher Paolini has his way of making you see exactly what he wants you to see. Great read."
2,Let down all the way around,"I had really looked forward to the second installment, knowing that sophomore efforts are sometimes a little weak. That was unfortunately the case here. Eragon gains terrific strength and power as expected and the conflict builds between the Varden and the Empire. The action in the book continued to hold my interest but the language and writing was almost unbearable at times. ""Barges' I don't want no stinking barges!"" Come on! And if I had to read one more introspective moment with Eragon and Arya, I would have had to put the book down without finishing it. I hope the third book shows more maturity in its writing style."
3,well...,"I didn't read LOTR carefully and have never really watched Star Wars (although I do know the basic plot). But if someone like me can pick out similarities between Eldest and the others (including LeGuin), then there must be a lot indeed."
2,Can't help but laugh...,"Okay, so I just have to say how funny this is for me. While reading the beginning of Eragon the first thing I said to my husband was, ""this book is like Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings."" I didn't think anything of it, finished the book (fairly enjoying it considering the young authors age), and then checked out the reviews out of curiousity to find everyone else noting the same comparisons I did! It's hilarious! And yes, a sad, sad truth to what I had heard was a unique and creative novel. Even people like me who are unfamiliar with Star Wars (I've only seen one) and Lord of the Rings (watched the first one) could see this uncanny similiarity. Good luck Paolini-it's a good thing you didn't write this for a college course (you could be expelled for plagarism) :)"
1,Land of the disappearing reviews,What a disappointment this was!!! The story goes on and on and on nothing happens nothing ever happens. The only reason I give it one star is cause I can't give it no stars. What a rip off. I will not continue the series.
3,"long, drawn out, until end","What makes a climax of a story what it is is the buildup, but the buildup shouldn't be long and boring, and I think the Eldest is disappointing in this aspect. The first 500 pages are so slow, giving us necessary buildup for the climax without making this part as good as it could be. Dialogue is filled with obvious statements and don't make sense sometimes (Saphira calls Eragon ""Little one"" with the same tone, even as she goes through emotional turmoil. The parts I looked forward to, like Roran learning about Eragon, are written in a way that almost brushed over the moment leaving me dissapointed. Only the ending is great (though predictable), but that is at the expense of the rest of the novel.Paolini's vocabulary has certainly improved. You'll find SAT words on every page. But his writing as a whole, including organization and pace, is not as good as the first book, Eragon."
1,SEND IT BACK!!!,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and so many people are obviously disappointed with this novel. I certain am and I sent my copy back to show how disappoited I am.What I don't like is it is a seriously boring, tedious read. Reading Eldest felt more like work than enjoyment. All the characters talk alike. Paolini takes like ten pages to write about the simplest thing but doesn't really say anything at all in those ten pages. It's like your reading air. Skip this book. If you must read it borrow it from a friend or get it from the library."
4,Longer But Better,I liked this one better. I'm not going to write a plot summary but I will tell you that it's basically based on Star Wars with a little bit of Lord of the Rings. The plot twists are a lot like Star Wars. I did enjoy Eragon's training time. I know a lot of people seem to find that boring but I was really interested in it. I didn't enjoy Roran. I find him not fully developed as a character so he is hard to read. I didn't like that the battle and what was playing out in the battle was so fast and poorly written. However even though I knew what was coming I enjoyed the plot twists. I'm looking forward to the next and final book so that I can see if he veers off the Star Wars trilogy connection.
1,Should come with a warning label,I read and then re-read the glowing reviews and am dumbfounded! I am wondering if it isn't some kind of Amazon marketing scam since Amazon posts reviews at its discretion. It worked on me I bought both Eragon and Eldest. The story wonders aimlessly. The characters are irritating and don't do anything rationally. For anyone to give this book any stars is beyond me. Maybe they were trying to review a different book?
1,Disappointed,"You would hope that in a second effort, lessons would have been learned and perhaps acted upon. No such luck in Eldest. This book gasps for editorial attention. The number one thought in a reader's mind should not be the quality of the writing. Here, it was."
5,Librarians need not apply,"Some people seem to misunderstand what a story is meant to do, which is to entertain. Regardless of Paolini's source of inspiration, this book enveloped me into a fictional world that was so enriched with descriptional writing that at times I felt like part of the story itself. Paolini never claimed to be writing the next American Novel, he wanted to write a story that allowed people to escape their own world and transpose themselves into a fantasy world rich with flamboyant heroics and brutal honor. Read this book, regardless of your favorite genre, you will find this story refreshingly simple to read and expertly woven from chapter to chapter."
1,"Alas, Eldest (Eragon book II)","The book was bad, bad, bad. It's so slow that the reader can't get into it. Page after page of rituals and minor incidents that go no where, but slow down the pace and bores one to death. I was obvious our young author has a lot of ideas & issues and decided to cram everything into this book....he even tried to teach the reader how to make lace. Too, young Paolini wrestling with his teenage sexual frustration writes his characters into several awkward and unneeded love scenes that not only include Eragon, but for poor old Sephira. If Mr. Paolini is determined to write a third book it is hope that he reads book I and tries to recapture the energy and pace, otherwise let him stop writing until he matures as a fantasy writer."
2,to predictable,I really liked the first book but was disapointed with this one. I thought that this book had no surpises and just went on and on and on ect.
5,Why do people say it doesn't live up to Eragon?,"I'll admit this: Eragon was way too good for its sequel to be as good, but Eldest was still fantastic. I'll also admit that it is like star wars, but frankly I'm so hooked when I'm reading it that I can't tell, and don't care for that matter. Please, you don't have to buy it, but at least get it from the library to try it out if you read the first book."
5,Eldest is a VERY good book!!!,"I think that Eldest is the best book that I have read in my whole entire life. The suspence, the violence, everything. I would evan say that it is better than the first one. I hope that the thrid, and final,book is evan bettr. i gave it 5 stars, but it deserves 10!! If you are anyone around my age, (12 almost 13) then I recomend this book for you. Good job Paolini! I wish that you would write more books like the ones that you have already written, though enan better."
4,Its very good rivaling harry pooter even but any1 else notice the similaritys with Star Wars???,"Its a very good stoy one of the best I have ever read and I cant see why these other people hated it... If u liked harry potter or other fantasy books this is the book 4 you!!! Its well writen and has a good plot.The only bad thing is it is just like star wars!!! 1st he has a loveing familly but they are not his real prents(Luke Skywalker and his aunt and uncle?!), He had an old trainer who is sectretly a dragon rider who dies just as everything seems 2 get better(Luke and Obi-Wan!!), his father is realy one of the forsworn, the bad guys that were once good,(Luke and Anikin(Vader)!!!), his new trainer is old and in bad shape(Luke and Yoda!!), and finally as he starts getting good training he has a vision and has 2 go help his friends before his training is conplete(Luke leaveing Yoda 2 save Leia Han and chewbacca!!!)See what I mean??"
3,Entertaining if nothing else,"One thing I found particularly interesting about this book was the range of reviews it received and I'd have to say I agree with some of the points made by those giving it 1 star and also some from the 5 star givers. I think it would depend on what your looking for in a book; if you're mostly after something to take up a bit of time and distract you from whatever else is going on then you're more likely to enjoy this book then say the hardcore LOTR/Starwars fans who devote their time to discovering new treasures in this genre. It's not the best in it's field and Paolini isn't able to completely hide his writing skill level amoungst character development or an all involving storyline as other young writers have previously achieved. I was disappointed when I was so easily able to predict what would happen but despite all this, I did find it enjoyable and for Eragon's parts at least, not boring. I think I'll end up reading the 3rd, but I'm not counting down the days..."
1,Overhyped and unreadable,"After all the buzz, I finally decided to give this series a try. It is shallow, linear, simplistic and boring. Don't buy this book if you are looking for something along the lines of Tolkien, LeGuin, or even Rowling. You will be sadly disappointed."
1,Embarrassing,"When Mr. Paolini looks back on these books and related comments in a couple of decades it will be a painful experience. Writing a trilogy, no matter how bad, at such a young age is quite an accomplishment. Twenty years from now he should see them for what they are - a combination of Jr. High love letters and Philosophy 101 essays mixed into a base of rip offs from all over popular culture, not just science fiction and fantasy."
1,To Dan Carrera. Again,"Sorry Dan. I missed this comment in my rebuke of you.""Oh, and one more thing A KID'S REVIEW. If you like the books you THINK he stole ideas from, then you must certainly like Eragon and Eldest. Only because it's like others. But im not changing my opinion about you. As well as others."" No, his blatant stealing of ideas angers me. He stole ideas that weren't his, chewed them up, and regurgitated them into this book, adding nothing of his own. Everywhere I read, I thought to myself ""I've read ALL of this before."" What's wrong with wanting something new, Dan? And ""im"" not changing my opinion about you or Eldest either."
2,Doesn't add more to the Genre than it copies,"I got through the second book, Eldest, by skim reading and skipping whole paragraph's and pages. Too long, too verbose, with too little worth reading. But my major disappointment is similar to the reviews of many others: Paolini takes the ideas and themes of other authors so much, but adds very little original concept to the Genre. It lacks a convincing identity and character of is own to differentiate itself from much better works of fiction. But I gave it two stars because it did fill in two rainy days of vacation, and I am a sucker for adventure tales."
4,A interesting book,This book was written by a young person and is pointed towards them but can still capture the intrest of the mature crowd and ejoy this book'
5,Eldest,This book was in very good condition. I really enjoyed the book very much. I wish there were more books like this one. I try to order from goodwill in San Frisco when they have the book in stock.
5,A good read,Nice bed side night time reading . Helping relax and venture off into dream land. That opens the mind to far off lands
3,Satisfactory at the Most,Does anybody understand how terrible it is to listen to Christopher Paolini describe an ant? I haven't any care for a child to recite quotes from star wars and Lord of the Rings! Only read the final eight or so chapters or you might suicide from severe boredom disease. SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This book really really stinks.
1,Not so Great,"This book is a copy of lots of books. It's obvious that Christopher is using other things from other books. Like Eragon sounds a lot like Aragorn and Arya sounds a lot like Arwen...and since Morzan is evil and Eragon is good AND is his son, that's like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker...!!! I found the parts with Roran were completely boring and uninteresting. I thought that they could have been made shorter and also not so frequent. Yeah, there were a couple parts which were okay, but this book is not a bestseller in my book! And what's with the elves? It's like another Tolkein copier! Don't waste your money on this one, guys, it's not worth it. Borrow it from the library or friend."
5,amazingly good book,"There are 2 reasons this is an amazingly good book. 1: the author can write pages & pages of action that is interesting to young adults & teens. 2: the author can write pages & pages of plot that is interesting to young adults & teens. lots of young adult books are dull because they are written by old adults. but this book and eragon i loved straight away because the author is young & can write stuff thats amazingly interesting to me. other amazingly good books: Eragon by C. Paolini, Kealoha the Keeper by E. Kay & The Opal Deception by E. Colfer."
1,OH! Dear God! WHY?!,"Oh why? This was a massacre of popular stories OTHER PEOPLE WROTE! I fully expected Morzan to come back from the dead Kenobi-style and announce to the world, ""Eragon, I am your father."" and Eragon to anguish over it for the rest of the book. OH WAIT! That last part actually HAPPENED! Garion was also overdue for an appearance, coming in to say, ""Why did you steal the cool mark on my hand that I have to keep hidden?"" And for added fun, why not throw in a cute little scene where Arya's scent WAFTS toward Eragon, and she smells suspiciously like pine needles and another spicy scent. Oh wait, I think he did that too! Somebody read too many of his mom's romance novels when he was younger! This was a horrible book. If you value your sanity, IQ level, or anything else, DON'T read this. I regret actually borrowing this book from the library, and genuinely feel sorry that they spent money on this piece of cliched, predictable drivel."
2,Too PC for me,"I've liked the story for the most part. I'm not too crazy about the idea of atheist vegetarian elves (Tolkien must be spinning). Comparing the killing of rabbits to killing humans? Please... At least he didn't try making his dragon eat tofu and bean sprouts.The ending of Eldest was a let down. Eragon turned into quite the wimp at the end, begging for his hide. Lame. I'm now rooting for King Galbatorix."
4,"Not the best, but not the worst","I read Eragon when I was in 4th grade, at the advice of my english teacher. I absolutely loved it, and managed to get a signed copy when Paolini was in my area. I couldn't wait for the second volume to come out, and when it did, I waited for my local bookstore to open, and walked down the boardwalk to pick it up (I was at the beach at the time).That said, I was both pleased and dissapointed. I thought that some of the prose was too flowery, and too much time was spent on descriptions, but overall, it was enjoyable, and better than the first volume. I thought Paolini went a long way in developing Roran, and he seems like a very human character. Also, the ending is quite a surprise, although I will say that I correctly guessed the identity of Eragon's father, and ended up winning $5 from a friend over it. I reccomend people read it, and I look forward to the publication of volume 3."
5,Great Book,I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed Eragon. I am so amazed that these books were written by someone so young. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out to continue the adventure
4,A Great Adventure,"Eldest is the sequel to Eragon. In Eragon we meet a young farm boy who discovers something that would soon change his life forever. He found a large egg while huntung oneday and when it hatched a dragon emerged and choose him as its Rider. The king of the land where the boy lived was a very bad one and there were those(the Warden) who opposed him. The boy, Eragon, and his dragon,saphira, end up living in a stronghold with the Warden.Eldest picks up the story of Eragon just after a Great battle, and is about Eragon's journey to try to help the Warden remove the King from power. This book moves at a very steady pace, so dont start reading this thinking that you will finish its 668 pages in one sitting. Although some say that the book is ""even worse then the first one"", i have to disagree. As in the first book, Eldest creschendos into a great battle at the end. I found it very entertaining even though i was left hanging and now i have to antipate the 3rd book of the series."
2,Not Progressing,"After the first few pages of this book I was like ""Wow! We're going to have some good action!"" and then a few hundred pages later I'm regretting that thought as it has not come to fruition. What disappoints me the most is the predictability. There is not an original idea used in these books. Its obviously the product of a fantasy fan who has read too much. I'm hoping that as Paolini grows and matures he is able to produce a story that is from his own imagination instead of one thats been borrowed from here, there and everywhere. I would rather hand kids the originals and not the copy."
1,Awful,"This book was just awful. There was zero originality, the characters were flat, the prose purple, dialogue forced and unbelievable, events laughable, main character [Eragon] a wimp, and so on...Does anyone else believe Christopher Paolini used a thesaurus for every other word in this book, choosing the longest one as a replacement? I doubt he even looked up the new words' definitions, as none of them made any sense and made the prose sound awkward.Eldest in a nutshell. ^^~Kate"
3,Ok...but annoying,"It's readable (especially if you enjoyed Eragon), but it'll drive you nuts. I don't have as much of a problem with it being like Tolkien, but I do have a problem that reading this book made me feel like I was taking an SAT prep course. In a book like this it REALLY is better to say ""he was confused"" than ""he was ambivalent"" (not sure if this exact example exists in the book, but you get the idea). It was getting on my nerves quite a bit - made it hard to read at times. Also, although lots of things happen in the book and many questions get answered, it feels ""slower"" than Eragon, I think mostly because the story line isn't that strong. So this is by far not my favorite book. Yet, it was still fun to read...so if you liked Eragon, you'll probably get satisfaction (though not great excitement) out of reading this one."
3,note i have never read it,never read it but you probably should not get this book look at the video of the author when he tells about his book he said the story is kind of vage and he is supprised he even finished the first book.
1,Why?,"Why has anyone in the publishing world brushed past better genius to allow this young person to be exploited? Give time to grow up, before asking someone to share what they don't have. It'll come easier then, when life is understood well enough to relate to others with some sense of humility."
2,"Luke, I am your father!","What more is there to say?I managed to rewrite Eldest in 5 words. Beat that.To anybody who reads this: I am mocking this book, and would prefer only ""not helpful"" reviews because heh, why not?"
2,"""Luke, I am your father""","I already know the Star Wars plot, if I wanted to read it again I would have bought the Star Wars books instead. Luke Skywalker riding a dragon ? What is this ? Even Yoda is there !!!"
1,"Amazing, THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!","This is a goob book, I do not read dat many books,but dis is a goob book...Amazing, da best book eva written...I seriously need to read more literature, but dis is a goob book."
1,Disappointing,"After all the hype I read in the reviews, I was expecting more from this book. I found the characters very flat and undifferentiated. They seemed just to plod from place to place, and I found it hard to care at all what happened to them. There are tons of good books out there, this isn't one of them."
5,"As good as ""Eragon""","I will keep this simple: I think ""Eldest"" is as good as ""Eragon"". I listened to the audio book and found the book just as spell binding."
1,Let's settle the argument,"Okay I notice there is an argument on the space below me. Here's the verdict: ERAGON SUCKS. End of story. Why?1. Too much like Star wars. Period.2. Piss poor writing. My 7 year old can do better with the English language.3. Rip off of LOTR. He uses the line ""Fly you fools!""4. The story is stupid. The characters are incosnistent and the concept is unoriginal.If you want a really good book about dragons, read Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate by Kenneth Eng, another young author. I mean, he's obviously not as financially successful as paolini, but he's still a better writer."
1,Eldest STINKS!,Eldest is the worst book I've ever read in my life. For the life of me I don't know why it got published. It's sad to see honest reviews get buried by response reviewers who lavish 5 star raves on what is at best the worst book of the year and at worst the worst book of the decade. Comparing Paolini to Tolkien is only meant to further the hype. There's nothing in the writing comparative in the least. People should focus on the writing which is awful. Paolini should be glad people still believe he's a kid which at 22 years old he is not.
3,A Good Review,The book Eragon basically laid the grounds for what would happen in Eldest. I'll admit that the book Eldest had a few surprises but some things were dragged out when they didn't need to be. The other Rider was a surprise but the biggest surprise was Murtagh being a Rider and serving Galbatorix. I believe that the next book will be very interesting.
1,ELDEST IS AMAZING!!!!!,"Gee! Wow! I'm giddy!! I love Eldest, I think it is the best bookever written!!! You, see, I don't get out much!!! I even have an Eragon Fannypack that I wear at school!!! People call me a nerd, but hey, I love Eragon!!!!"
4,ELDEST,"I AM 54 YEARS YOUNG AND I HAVE BEEN ENTHRALLED WITH ERAGON AND ELDESTMAYBE THE KIDS WHO HAVE READ THIS FIND IT TOO COMPLICATED AND THEN GIVE IT A BAD REVIEW, I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW IT IS GEARED TO 8 YR OLDSI WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW WELL THEY COULD WRITE A TRILOGY AS COMPLICATED AS THIS, OR ANY ADULT FOR THAT MATTERI AM TIRED OF THE COMPARISON TO LOTRTHIS HAS A LOT OF VERY NEW IDEAS AND TO SAY IT IS POORLY WRITTEN IS LUDICROUSTHE VOCABULARY IS ASTOUNDING AND THE LANGUAGE THAT HE HAS MADE UPEXTRAORDINARYI THINK THAT THE REVIEWERS, ESPECIALLY AT ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY THAT GAVE IT A D EITHER DID NOT READ ITDO NOT CARE FOR FANTASY, OR SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THEIR LOVE FOR CHICK LITOBVIOUSLY, IT IS OVER THEIR HEADSNAPADOLLY"
1,12 year old fan 100% Disappointed,"Don't think anyone expected Eldest to have tons of action or anything, just expecting it to be readable. I sure DID expect it to be readable. This book sTINKS!!!"
1,Plain Rubbish!,"This is just a copy of LOTR and HP all through, It doesn't even makes sense!And this Paolini guy thinks he really is something, he's just plain wrong and all of you whom buy his books would know better before doing so.Mind buying Harry Potter than this piece of junk, all right?!"
2,Eldest: No need to read this if you've seen star wars 5,"This dissapointing sequal to Eragon is close to twice as long as Eragon and twice as tedious. I really can't believe I wasted twenty three bucks on this boring rip off of lord of the rings, harry potter and star wars. In fact, the ending is taken right out of Empire Strikes Back, only instead of ""Luke, I am your father it's ""Eragon, I am your brother."" Dissapointing awaited sequal. Skip the stuff about Ellesmera if you do not wish to throw up in disgust at the love scenes between Eragon and Arya. Stupid."
5,Eldest,"I brought this book for my son aged (11 years), after he read the first one, and really loved it. He read this one in full in 6 days and couldn't put it down. He loves these type of books and carn't wait for the next one."
1,AWFUL,"I was shocked and in disbelief when our local paper reviewed Eldest and gave it its ""lowest rating ever"" F-. Previously I had thought that Entertainment Weekly's D+ rating was harsh but F-?Imagine my outrage when those reviews turned out to be not harsh enough. This book is really awful. Was this book rushed to print? Was any editing done? I can't for the life of me imagine it was."
1,Totally Not Worth It,Eldest is stinks! I kept on having to force myself through it to the end. The end sucks too! Nothing in hear worth it.
1,just borrow it...,"Arg, this book was HORRIBLE! One thing that really stuck out at me was when one of the characters said, ""HA! You're as weak as a woman!"" or something like that. can you say stereotypical? If you must buy this book, just borrow it from a friend or the library. chances are, you won't read it more than once."
2,A disappointment,"Having loved the first book, we waited for so long for the second book only to be disappointed. This book reads like a complicated video/computer game, too intent on creating a new language, overloaded on strange names and unneeded characters and short on character development and plot. The author seems to have lost the art of storytelling and is concentrating on creating another universe that the reader really has no need to enter except if the reader wants to try to master its intricacies for the sole purpose of mastering those intracacies. We literally stopped halfway through the book, a first."
3,Missing Chapters!!,"I LOVED Eragon! I LOVE Eldest however... critical chapters are missing and replaced by chapters from a book called Inkspell. The continuity is destroyed, twice!From page 241-272 we miss important info about Eragon and Saphira's teachers, Oromis and Glaedr, and who knows what else? Again from page 353-384 entire chapters are missing. This spoils an otherwise excellent story by leaving the reader confused.A marketing ploy or a publishers snafu?"
5,Review by a kid,I find that the criticisms of Eragon were well based but the notion of laying the same criticisms on Eldest is preposterous. It is very evident that Mr. Paolini has greatly matured in his writing and that is to be expected. This book is not at all bad I found a few reviews saying that the characters did stupid things but those are explained if the reader is paying attention to everything that is going on. This is a great book and I look forward to reading the third one. (By the way I don't care how old Mr. Paolini is and yes I am a kid as well.)
1,Like pulling teeth...,"The second book does not come close to the first. Eragon was an entertaining and easy read. This second book is painfully slow. I feel as if I have read this story before. Bad, bad, bad!!"
1,Skip it!!,This is such an insult to anyone who's ever read another fantasy book before! Most worthless book ever in the history of the world. Better to burn your money than to waste it on this drivel. One wonders if the author ever had high school English....I don't see how that is possible.
3,"I have to admit, I like this one better than Eragon.","There was next to no action and every thing I predicted that would happen after reading Eragon, happened. The one thing I did like about the book was that you saw a lot more of the characters personalities. That's one thing that was missing from the first book. The only ""surprise"" was the cursed child. I did not expect that. Over all, it was long winded but kept my interest better than Eragon."
4,good job Paolini!,"If a book really tears me apart from the real world, that I call a real fantastic one! I really enjoyed this book more than the first one,Eragon.However it would be better if the author kept the languages more ""human"" and not push the readers to look at the dictionary at the back of the book,in every single part...Yet, it couldn't keep me away from reading it even in the elevator when I am on the way to work! I am looking forward to read Empire, the book three..."
2,One word: Disappointing,"After reading Christopher Paolini's first entry into the Inheritance trilogy, 'Eregon,' I was eager to jump into the second book in the series, 'Eldest.'Maybe I was too eager.The novel trudges, and I mean trudges along for the first five hundred pages or so, with little happening. It's not until the last hundred or so pages that Paolini cranks up the happenings that the book did anything for me. 'Eregon,' the first book was masterful. Many things happened to Eregon in his quest in the first novel. In this one, he goes to live with the elves to train as a dragon rider... and that's about it.Aside from a twist at the end, beautiful prose, and this book being a bridge to the last novel in the series, there's just not much here in this nearly seven-hundred page book.I was disappointed, and I hope that the last book in the Inheritance trilogy lives up to the legacy that the first started."
4,Eldest is Cool!,"You must read Eldest! It is an awesome book, just like Christopher's Paolini's first novel, Eragon. This second book in his fantasy trilogy is filled with action and magic.The author, Christopher Paolini, writes enchantingly about Eragon, a young adult, and his dragon, Saphira. Eragon travels to Ellesmera, the land of the elves, with Saphira. He trains as the legendary ""Dragon Rider,"" a protector against the evil King Galbatorix. Eragon learns how to cast magic spells, how to swordfight and how to heal wounds.When the action adventure begins against the evil king's army, watch out! You'll be hooked on this book because of the page-turning excitement. Eragon's bravery and the danger he faces everyday will leave you in suspense!By Steve B."
5,People for get its a story.,"Ok to begin I like both books. Yes they could be better and all that but you must remember the guy writing these is young himself. Another this is this is something to read and enjoy. If you think its the same as any ohter fantasy novel why read it, but if you want to read it at face vaule its a good book. Yes everything in fantasy has been done before and it will be done again. there's not much we can do about that. I'm just going to say this read it for what it is a story and not something to anlyise every aspect of. Plus if you didn't like the first book why read the second? Thats all i'm going to say. If you want a good story try it out it might not be for you, but you never know."
5,Better than Eragon,"I want to say to all of you who have read the bad reviews that it's not true, it's a book filled with fresh adventure.One of the few books that has actually made me LIVE it."
2,"LISTEN to your critics, Chris","Paolini said that he doesn't listen to critics, good or bad, because they make him self conscious. This book makes that very clear. Most of the flaws of the past book and many of this book's anticipated flaws are still here. The characters still have no personalities of their own. Paolini repeats lines like ""single tear"" and ""strong of body, keen of mind"" far too often. And did Eragon go for his Yoda-style training? yep. Was ERagon's father a villain? yep, though at least it wasn't Galbatorix.I gave it an extra star because it's getting the kiddies to read"
4,Asking To Be Read,Thank you to Christopher Paolini for a yet another great book in his Inheritance Series. I love reading about Eragon and his adventures. Sadly we are expecting a very long wait to see book 3 and oh ya by the way. THERE WILL BE A BOOK 4 TOO!
4,Better,"Christopher Paolini has certainly grown as a writer. The writing is miles ahead of Eragon, although still cringe worthy in some places. Still deriative, although he has enough unique ideas to separate him from Tolkien. Way better than Eragon, although still weak. If Paolini continues to advance his writing skills with the release of each book than by the time the Inheritance Cycle is over it may be a classic.Need a light read than I highly recommend it. Wanting to get back to those classic epic fantasy stories about a farmboy, I highly recommend it. Seeking to see if Eldest is any better than Eragon I definetly recommend it."
3,More of the same,"Eldest is the second book in the Inheritance Cycle. This series is a bestseller, and I can only guess why: because the author is so young? The first book, Eragon, showed promise considering the author's age. It was an interesting story despite being too long and having so many elements borrowed directly from classical fantasy novels. I decided that was just immaturity as a writer and gave the Eldest a go. The story itself is interesting: Eragon travels to the land of the Elves to learn how to be a dragon-rider. However, the writing style didn't mature any from the first book. Eldest dragged because it was 300 pages of plot in 800 pages of detail. And, as much as I tried, I simply didn't like Roran's character. So if you absolutely loved the first book, more power to you: this book is more of the same! If you liked Eragon's story, but found the execution lacking, this book is more of the same--with a little less of that new-story-gleam."
3,Starwars with Dragons,"I don't mean to belittle his books because, some what like Harry Potter, they aren't nearly as good as the hype surrouding them, but they aren't that bad either. Eragon's journey, so far anyway, is very similar to Luke's journey in episodes 4-6. If you like those first movies, and I suspect there are some people out there who do, you will most likely enjoy these books."
3,Eragon was better,"My kids have both books, including an autographed copy of Eldest. A lot of kids stood in line at a local store to get it signed by him.This book is not as good as eragon. And both, when you read them, will remind you of Lord of the rings (tolkien),and The Dragon stories of Anne Mcaffrey.Still, this generation of kids have not read Anne Mcaffrey, so they enjoy these books. I did too, but can't say I've found anything original in them."
2,Very long and drawn out,"I listened to this book on audio to/from work, otherwise I would not have continued ""reading"" this series. Paolini is very detailed about the world and magic system, but that just doesn't drive a good story for me. In fact, I prefer authors to be more concise about that stuff. The book is OK, probably worthy on 2.5 stars, but it took me awhile to read it because I simply found it boring at times and went months between reading on multiple occasions."
5,I like it.... but I can see why others don't.,"I really loved this book and the book before it, Eragon, but I can see why others hate it. look up at the previous reviews and you will see that people either love this book or hate it (interesting huh?). Some people are die-hard fantasy fans (although they are becoming increasingly rare) and some people lothe fantasy in almost every shape and form (the exceptions are in movies, and the ocasional good book). This book is hard core fantasy and as I said before apperently too hard-core fantasy for some people. If you read fantasy often and can withstand the legth of this book it's just right for you, but if you don't like non-realistic fiction and usually read much shorter books, don't."
4,The Dragon review,I thought that this book a really good book. It is a great book for people who like that medieval books. I thought that Paolini did a great job by starting it with a battle and a killed character. This made the book really easy to start. I thought that he could've made the parts where they travel shorter.
1,Fool's Gold and Pie in the Sky,"Got this book as a gift so felt obligated to read it. At best, a muddled collection cobbled together from previously published books, all recycled. At worst, completely bogus with such keen utterances as ""Aye"" and ""Werg"", and annoying characters who slur their letters. Don't waste your money it'll be in the discount rack for 70% off soon."
1,Not aging well...,"I'd hoped that Paolini would improve with age...not so. The ""gimmick"" of his starting to write at 15 has run its course, and I'd say that Eldest would be trashed in even an introductory college writing class. The characters and plot are shallow and derivative and the dialogue is painfully simplistic. Aside from its length, it isn't even up to the standards of the average fantasy series."
1,Correction to a Kid's Review from 10th November,"After writing the review posted on the 10th of November, I realised I'd made a minor mistake in it.I re-checked Eldest and discovered that, in fact, Eragon's leather arm bracers were given to him by the dwarves. However, I missed a much more significant internal contradiction: Arya frequently dresses in leather. Okay, what the hell? It would be understandable if Eragon still wore leather, given that he's (sort of) human, but an elf? Yet another thing a competent editor should have fixed."
1,"Seriously....I mean, come ON!","Eldest is a HUGE disaster!! It's such a COPY of Tolkien! I mean, URGALS and ORCS. KULLS and URUKHAI. Sound familiar? And, what's with the 'elite' elves who don't bother getting off their lazy butts and help fight?And it's like a reinactment of Star Wars with Morzan and Eragon. And the names... they're just stupid.Yeah, maybe there were a couple okay parts, but most of it was just dumb and cheesy.I agree that Christopher Paolini uses too many complicated words in seriously simple statements! I mean, it's like, how do WE know what they mean...I mean, we don't ALL graduate high school at 15! Don't waste your money."
1,Reviews very misleading,"I read the reviews on this site for the previous book, which made me give it a try. Unfortunately, I found this book very unenjoyable. I couldn't wait for it to end. I don't usually write unfavorable reviews, but if I can encourage one person to save themselves from this boring book, then it was worth it."
1,"REHASH OF A WELL-WORN THEME, not to mention a knock-off of the Lord of the Rings","This book is but a bulk of fantasy rehash, a half-baked 'get rich quick' tome with nothing worthwhile in reading it...It should appeal to all illiterate-when-comes-to-great-literature readers,you know, those whose imaginations have been stifled by overly-formulaic hackneyed pulp fiction like this book...""I LOVED IT!!! BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!""...come on now, read a real book. I know most of these 'little' readers like the mythical escapism cause they lack something of the essence of real life.In short, this book is trite and ephemeral, like the author, and all the fan-boy bandwagon jumpers who think it (is) a good book."
3,Loses Its Shine,"Eldest was not really what I expected for the second volume of the Inheritance trilogy. The book never kept me interested, and it switched to different scenes constantly, from Eragon's perspective to Roran's. Eldest's prequel, Eragon, was much better written, with vivid details, suspense, and it was very good read. You could always guess what happens in Eldest, which really made the book less intriguing. Eldest never blew my mind away, and it never appealed to me as an awesome novel. Overall, however, it was a mediocre book with some interesting circumstances. I really hope the third book of the trilogy turns out a lot better than the second."
4,The Eldest,"My son TOTALLY enjoyed this book.(He's 11) The problem was he waited nearly 3 weeks before it came. He was so anxious and I had no contact from the sellers despite sending at least 2 e-mails. I had almost decided to order from someplace else when the book finally came.Now, two years later, I find myself looking for another copy of this book. He literally has read it to pieces!"
5,ENJOYING TO THE FULLEST!,I really enjoy this series. I can't wait to read the finale. The text is a bit wordy but the fantasy and story is real bliss. I just love the world and characters he has created. Not as easy to read as Harry Potter but worth the effort.
4,A Riveting Read,"This is a a brilliant sequel to eragorn. There are battles arguments and surprises. This grips you and just makes you want to read more. Find out about roran, eragorns injured back the gathering of Gallbatrixs army. Be warned there is a twist at the end.By George Vernon age 12 from Wantage"
2,SImply Not Good Enough...,"Eragon was a pleasure to read.A swashbuckling adventure involving a boy and a dragon. This time around Paolini decides to inject an otherwise good plot with a lot of filler material. The narrative drags at many places.The book is entertaining in parts.Paolini decides to juggle 2 to 3 differennt storylines and in the process....He falls flat on his face. Some subplots are deeply boring. Others mildly interesting. But there is nothing here for which you would say...Hell , that was cool. The storyline is heavily inspired by the Star Wars series. Paoilini even tries to include songs ... in the manner of Lord of The Rings..Needless to say that he fails miserably. I didnt like the book one bit. I had to slog through it because I had spent money on it. If you are looking for an LOTR like experience then stay away from this book. Better read LOTR again. I gave it two stars only because Paolini is young and he atleast tried his hand at writing.."
3,"Not brilliant, not a horror","I originally was captivated by Eragon's storyline, read it, was mildy engaged, and forgot about it. During the 'mildly engaged' period, I told a couple of friends about it, one of whom became obsessed. We didn't see each other for awhile, but when we did finally she reintroduced me to the bestselling phenomenon. I had a chance to reread Eragon, and wasn't utterly wowed. Christopher Paolini's writing style isn't unlike sme of the essays my class writes at school. Obviously the better ones, but still...Eldest failed to wow me, though I liked it better than Eragon, mostly because of the Burning Plains scenario. Murtagh has grown has a character in an utterly believable way, and I love how complex he is, as compared to some of the other characters. Roran was pretty boring."
1,Haven't I read this somewhere before? Or is it just me?,"I have read many books, and just about all of them have a great story line, great characters, and have a little ""new"" in them I never read before. With Eragon I liked, but Eldest falls sort of anything I liked for Eragon. And Eragon doesn't come close to any of the other novels I read such as: Elizabeth Haydon, J.R.R.Tolkien, George R.R. Martin, Kristen Britain, C. J. Cherryh, Anne McCaffrey, Mercedes Lackey, and Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman. I feel that all of these were shoved together to try to make an epic fantasy novel of dragonrider's. By the 20th page I immediately dropped the book in disgusts. This all seems so familar to me, and so boring. Of course, it's could be just me. But maybe Ill try it again when I have nothing else better to read. [I would give this review 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me]"
1,John Palencar is a genius!,"Who's John Palencar? The guy who drew the cover of Eldest. Isn't it just the most beautiful and vivid cover you ever saw? It's the best and most eye-catching cover I've ever seen, rivalled only by the cover of Eragon, which was drawn by the same guy. I'd pay good money for a large-size print of this book's cover to go on my wall. However, I wouldn't read the book again if *I* was the one being paid good money. The expression 'don't judge a book by its cover' was never more accurate in this case: Eldest has a gorgeous cover and a ghastly interior. Poorly written, boring, plagiarised... it's all been said. My advice is to go to the bookshop and look at the cover for nothing. You can enjoy fine artwork without having to pay for it that way."
3,there is something you guys got to understand...,The first book was much better for i gave that a five star but you guys need to understand that the middle book in a trilogy is never quite as good as the rest because its main purpose is to lead the path to the third book... In the second book of a trilogy the main character often plays the role of a rookie and as you could imagine he loses more struggles then not... now i'd advise you to buy this book but not because it is absolutly spactacular or because the narrtive plot will blow your mind but merely to gain an understanding on the trilogy so later when the author releases the third book you will be able to fully enjoy its obvious five star matterial to come...
3,A better effort,"A better read than ""Eragon"" but everything pretty much falls into place. No surprises here. If you liked ""Eldest"" you'll love ""The Naming"" by Alison Croggon even more."
1,How many times has Paolini seen Lord of the Rings???,"I can't believe this. Paolini clearly watched and/or read Lord of the Rings WAY TOO MUCH!!!For example, Orik, the dwarf. In LOTR, there's Gimli. I love Gimli and Orik clearly resmbles him. And he sucks!!!And there's Eragon and Arya, who fall in love. They resemble Aragorn and Arwen. Look at their names closely and you'll see that they are the same. Plus their character matches. In LOTR, Arwen is the daughter of the elf lord Elrond. Arya is the dughter of Queen Islandi. And both Eragon and Aragorn have long life.I read the whole thing and compared it to LOTR. In the end, LOTR is much better. Read them instead of this garbage."
4,DELIGHT for the FAMILIAR fans....,"Our Kitty HERO is at it again, Fun, Interestingly well crafted mystery. Plenty of""Red Herrings"" to keep you guessing. A great job of discribing the area of New Orleans with it's colorful, streets, resturants & surrounding climes. As always the wonderful Familiar, ala Cat Dectective..."
1,Um....,"This product came nice and quickly, but came in the worst coniditon. The product came with hard-as-sin to remove Denver Library stickers all over the case, and inside on the CD. the DVD came damaged; watchable, but damaged. I guess this falls under failed customer serivce, I mean, can't do anything about the DVD being damaged but if you can put them stickers on, I know damn well you can take them off. AT LEAST!"
5,A RELAXING STROLL,VERY FINE CD...WONDERFUL FOR SLOWING THE HEART & SOOTHING THE SOUL.A HAPPY MARIAGE OF MEANDERING CREATIVITY & SPONTANEITY.
4,Always Good to Read a Deighton Thriller,"I've read and thoroughly enjoyed most of Len Deighton's books, but for some reason, this one escaped me. Till now, and I'm glad a relative foisted it upon me. Few authors write with the skill and authority of Deighton -- especially those of the ""spy"" genre. I'll take Deighton any day over the pretentious Le Carre or the hyperbolic Ian Fleming. I don't think this is one of Deighton's best books but Deighton's ""average"" is usually superior to other writer's ""excellent."" The plot seems to gently descend on the reader like a cloud and by book's end, you've absorbed a lot. Good characterization, good place descriptions, good plot. All of it enjoyable. It's been a while since I've read a Deighton book, and now I'm ready to go back and re-read his entire oevre. Few writers have given me more pleasure."
1,Practice what you Preach,Mr. Wertman obviously fancies himself a better father than a husband-at the latter he was and is a dismal failure.
4,Diane Schuur & The Count Basie Orchestra,"I bought this title at YONGSAN Electronic Store in South Korea... $40...(-_-) but...No regret! Easily worth the price. HAHAHA ! I like a Jazz very much. I'm a fan of Diane Schuur! This DVD is... A must have for fans and non-fans alike! and...This is without a doubt a video any serious jazz enthusiast must have. Diane Schuur& The Count Basie Orchestra gives a great performance! Especially, I like ""Until I Met You""..It's very good song ! Video&Sound is normal. but I recommend this title! I'm not ashamed to have this in my collection. Thank you..ps. I'm sorry...I'm not speak English very well...because I'm korean^^"
4,Great music,"Great music. If someone finds the price of this DVD too high, the music is also available as CD at normal CD price.As always, the rhythm guitarist Freddie Green (with the Basie band since 1937!) is the hidden force who keeps the whole band on the track. Green was perhaps even more important for the identity of the Basie band than Basie himself. Guitar nerds may notice Greens incredibly high string action, which made his instrument impossible to play for other guitarists who dared to give it a try."
3,"supposedly 100M water resistant, but failed at a water park","Had this watch 6 months and it failed at a water park. I was no more than 1 meter underwater, but some of the waterfalls and such obviously exerted more pressure, but I wouldn't think 100 meters of water pressure? I know it died due water damage as water appeared under the watch face. Usually Casio watches are tougher. Warranty return was easy via the casio website."
1,It doesn't work!,"I got the watch because of the 10 year battery.The battery is fine but the watch never worked, I found out this because I had to carry it to be serviced."
2,impossible to set,"This is a very nice inexpensive watch using atomic time, but is impossible to set or change time zones and if you ever try without the directions, you are lost permanently. I am a college graduate and was on vacation, when I wanted to change time zones. I was not able to find anything about this watch to be intuitive. I could not google any help. When I arrived home, I found the watch was not receiving the signal and had to send it back so they could reset it. Not too convenient."
4,Super deal on a good watch,"I've had my watch for a while now, so I though it would be time for a review. First it was really cheap, less than $15. With that in mind I'd have to say it's a good quality watch for that price. It's really light weight, easy to keep clean, the battery lasts 10 years so thats a good thing. The watch face scratches easily, and it lacks a self lighting function. But all things considered I think it's a good buy."
2,watch band,Good watch but the band did not hold up. The band broke within a month. Now I am having trouble buying a new band because it is not a standard width band. I found one on amazon but the price of the band is almost as much as the watch.CASIO Men's MW600F-4AV 10-Year Battery Sport Watch
2,Doesn't hold up long,"We have a small car (honda insight) so we can't use just any shade, but this one fit well. Our son got a kick out of having balloons and Pooh to look at, but it didn't last more than 6 months. The suction cups got kind of hard, or dried up and stopped sticking. The roller broke and worst of all, our son was suddenly able to pull a metal stick out of the bottom one day. We've since paid an extra $4.00 for a higher quality product and it's holding up much better."
2,"Solid Feel, Flimsy...","We just installed two of these sun shades and while the build quality of the case and mechanism feels sturdy, the shade is flimsy and does not seem to be durable. I also didn't stop to think that it's not really easy to see through the shade so they create blind spots. I think next time I would purchase a shade without the graphics."
3,Jack Spicer review,"The songs are great, but the sound quality on half of the cuts is very edgy and hard to listen to. It seems that no effort was made to process the originals. A disclosure is printed on the back of the disc referring to this. So if you are fussy about sound you may be disappointed. I recently purchased Hit Parade 1946 (a different series) released in 2007 and it has the word, 'Dynamic' printed on the disc and it is a much smoother sound. I hope that this information is helpful to you."
3,Decent. Does the job I need.,"This is a decent cheap folder. what do you expect for this price, you know? If you are looking for a heavy duty workhorse, this is not the folder to get. But if you're like me and you want to store some info here, a little menu organizing there, etc, then this will get the job done."
3,2 out of 3,I ordered 3 binders.2 binders were perfect.however the 3rd binder was torn at thespine.I did not wish to get to involved by complaining.I am sure that if I had theywould have replaced the defective binder.
4,"Good Binder, But a Bit Pricey","When reviewing a 3-Ring Binder, there's really not much you can say. The binder either works or it doesn't and it's either durable or it's not. There's also the price factor and if the binder comes with any extras. This 3-RING BINDER from Acco-Wilson is a typical, one-inch 3-Ring Binder. It works well for its size, has a sleeve pocket in the front and back, is rather durable. I've used these binders for work, school, and personal use and have never had a problem with them. The only negative is that these binders are a bit expensive. There not at all different from most binders available at retail stores that sell for about a half to a quarter of the price that they are sold for here at Amazon."
1,Broke in less than 1 quarter,"Crappy, cheap construction. Looks fine and worked only for 3 months before the bottom ring failed to close."
4,Did You Know?,"The story and illustrations are to the point, enjoyable and specific. A reader will not be distracted by either overly illustrated or written information.Adults probably will learn a little to a lot. In addition to Frogs and Toads other species are mentioned and hopefully the reader is aware of inter dependency as well as important."
3,It'a not a toy,"This is a pre-built model, not a toy. Any kid who wants to get into a batub and play with this is goiing to be disappointed. the guns dont move, it's brittle and will break easily.If the buyer understands that this is a display modle, and treats it gently, then they will be happier, building a scale model this size is not easy. The price is right for someone interested in naval battles and history.I bought it for me, a collector of models who is going to display and use it for show. People who have that in mind will appreciate the ability to immediately add a model to the collection without assembeling it. Of course, pre-builts do tend to look that way, they are not as detailed as an assemneled kit, but that the trade off.Just know why you're buying this & you should be ok."
2,Buy the older model for juicer perfection.,"I checked the reviews here for this newer model of the juicer I have and found that the newer model doesn't have very good reliability. If it works, it works great, but many of them break in the first few uses. The same thing happened to a friend of mine who bought the Black and Decker version of a citrus juicer after envying my 20-year-old Proctor Silex Juicit. The good news is that the 20-year-old model is still widely available on eBay. Go look for a Proctor Silex Juicit that has been used but still works great from a seller with a high rating (99.5% positive feedback) and you can't go wrong. Mine doesn't have a catch pitcher like the new one. The juice pours from the ceramic reamer(its ceramic crisp edges are another plus over B&D's plastic parts) through a metal strainer into a funnel that guides it into a bowl or other container that you provide. It may not be as handy, but it has worked on at least a weekly basis for over 20 years now!"
1,Waste of time,"Mine went to small appliance heaven in under 3 min, halfway thru the third orange heard a loud 'pop', neatly packed & RMA'ed it. Lot easier to just eat the oranges!"
4,Very good juicer,Works very well. Other than the adjustible strainer if set at a low setting will block all the juice due to the pulp build-up. Very easy to clean.
1,Stopped within minutes,It stopped working after my 3rd squeeze of half of orange slice & never worked again. I returned it.
1,Low quality product,"The juicer broke the first time I used it. Shipped it back, and lost the shipping cost of over $7.00"
5,Less is More,Bought this for my girlfriend after she used the one i had.She had a high end expensive model.She gave that away and loves this one. Less is more..
4,Fragile item - but good to use,"I bought this item in 2010 and the glas broke after it fell from my hand. This item is fragile but the second time, I bought this again as this was much cheaper than the other products and overall this is a pretty good juicer. Make sure you handle the glass jar carefully."
1,Lucky,Unfortunatly I purchased the juicer prior to reading any reviews. Big Mistake! Had I read reviews I would never have purchased the juicer. I feel lucky in comparision to some other consumers as it broke on the 2nd use. Don't waste your hard earned money. Find another juicer.
1,Defective product,"The first time this juicer was used, it worked for approximately 5 minutes, and quit completely. Very disappointed with the quality. Returned for refund."
1,Completely broke first time used,"When I used the juicer the first time, I used this to juice a lime. It only juiced half of the lime and then stopped. I turned it off and could hear ball bearings rolling around inside. Too cheap!"
5,Electric Juicer,"I am so happy with my electric juicer, I can have a glass of fresh orange or grapefruit juice in a matter of minutes. How healthy can one get???"
3,Bulky,"This item turned out to be larger and bulkier than what I expected, although the product description clearly indicates ""extra-large capacity."" I am returning the unit without trying and it is hard to expect too much from a $12.99 product but this item feels rather not very well made. The plastic lid does not have a tight fit and neither do the rest of the parts."
1,worst juicer ever,"this item did not even go through 1 bag of oranges and stopped working, i picked it up and heard rattling in the bottom of the unit. i had bought it the year before at end of the orange season so by the time next year rolled around it was too late to return. i opened the bottom and found that the cheap plastic gear they put on the motor had twisted in half. i don't really like the brand in the first place never had cheaper products from any other manufacturer. don't buy this item unless u want to replace it shortly after u get it. if i could give it less than 1 star i would."
1,Two of them didn't work.,"Since two of them didn't work, this really deserves a zero.My 27 year old Proctor Silex juicer finally died. I used it thousands of time since 1979. I bought this and the motor stopped after 30 seconds. I returned it and the next one also worked for less than 30 seconds. Don't waste your time."
1,Proctor-Silex Juicer,"The first time I used the juicer the motor quit on me and never worked again. You can still use it as a hand juicer, but that's all."
1,Get the Re-Recording!!!!,"Although any album by Philip Glass is worth the money, honestly, if you are craving the music from the movie ""Koyaanisqatsi"", then the 1998 re-Recording will please you a hundred-fold more than this one. The new one is longer and not merely a ""soundtrack"", it IS the movie, sans images. But you make up your own images, if you like."
5,"Glass, P. : Koya....i.","The film was moving, the music superb. I especially like his organ style. I am a fan of Bach's Organ Works, so naturally it follows I like Glass's Organ. If you find you can't understand it, or find it un-original, then you haven't played it on maximum volume. Try Glass's ORGAN WORKS. magnificent ! Yet, this ( Koya..i) CD is really a rare find ! Superb. Great to accompany late night logic problems. Worth the money. For extracting the best impact of Glass, listen to early church music, and see how sophisticated the organ, as a musical instrument can be."
1,trash,The Grid is 18 minutes of what could quite seriously be used for the sound analogy to water torture. It is not only obnoxious but actually sounds juvenile as if a child were responsible for the noise. What a scam that guy has going on.
3,Balance is in the eye/ear of the beholder?,"While I am fascinated with the combined visuals/music of the film Koyaanisqatsi, I find its message to be profoundly disturbing. After all, it describes life that is ""out of balance"" and shows New York City to be the example of that unbalanced way. I wonder what Ric Burns, the director of the 12 hour PBS documentary on New York City, would think about the ""container of ashes"" prophesy of the Hopi. Still, the director Godfrey Reggio and the Philip Glass Ensemble have produced a ""singular"" vision which is compelling. I feel that it speaks more about the balance of the artists themselves than New York though. New York City, with its millions of inhabitants is difficult to describe in total. Watch the Ric Burns documentary which uses the Powaqqatsi score in part of its soundtrack. Somehow, that score of partial balance also works well in describing New York City. The music sets a tone for how we feel about a subject."
3,1900 Teapot Apples Trivet/Spoon Rest,"The spoon rest was great, but the teapot apple trivet ended up being a rooster trivet. They were both great quality and wonderful products the rooster just didn't fit."
5,Classic!,"This movie does not need MST3K to turn it into a comedy but, it's great to see their work here!The film is simply a masterpiece. If you are looking for trees chasing people to a self-gliding sled, and a mixture of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty with a really weird twist, this is your movie of the year."
3,Unimpressed,"I love me some MST3K, but I did not find this episode funny. The movie just did not provide the fodder they needed, and is damned bizarre on its own. There are a few real good ones, but this ain't no Gila Monster. Ha!"
1,Get The Real Version Of Talmud Jmmanuel By Billy Meier!,"George Green has stolen this information from Billy Meier and, although, this book still is a good read, it's not the true version of the Talmud. Look up Billy Meier's version ""Talmud Jmmanuel"" for the unaltered version.George Green is a fake and a phoney."
1,This Version has Errors!,Please buy the newer version just called Talmud Jmmanuel. All the other versions have errors in them. This version is a bootleg of the original & is full of translation errors. The corrected version of the Talmud Jmmanuel has no 'of' in the title & is the fourth edition. just search Amazon forTalmud Jmmanuelor click the links in this review. The corrected fourth edition of theTalmud Jmmanuelhas undergone a three year review by national and international editors resulting in the most accurate German-to-English translation to date. The fourth edition also contains an addendum of new material from the prophets Jeremia and Elia who lived long before the time of Jmmanuel.
3,Interesting book.,This book was a little difficult for me to read--it's definitely to be taken in small doses because the subject matter requires serious study and one needs to be of a certain mindset to be able to appreciate the writer's style.
5,Occult info,This book reveals the true story of Jesus (Jmmanuel) and the distortion that his name and message has been twisted into. It awakened me to many things that have been hidden. I will always treasure the day I discovered this book.
2,Entertaining reference for intelligent drinking.,"A good reference book to have next to your home bar or wine cellar with brief but informative descriptions. Unfortunately the book is very euro-centric: hundreds of entries on French wines and British beers, for example, but no entries for Tequila, Mezcal or Caipirinha (at least in the 1996 Edition; the 1997 Edition may fare better)."
5,Best Album Yet!,"I saw the band live in Alaska and absolutely loved them (go figure an Aussie band touring in Alaska)! They are full of spunk and jazz, and have some good slow folky songs as well! I also have their other albums, and this one is by far their best! The band is on a quest for words to describe their music and I thought to myself, how hard can it be?! But after listening to them, they have so many different styles of songs, that it really is hard to describe them, except to say that there's something for everyone on this album! There is no possible way you could be grumpy or sad after listening to their music, it is an automatic mood lifter! If you ever have the chance to see them live, make it a top priority! Until then, this album is FANTASTIC!!!"
4,spiderman pilot case,I am so certified with this pilot case..... my son (2 years old) loves it and happy with his new pilot case because came with back pack also. He can use it everytimes he spent night to his great grandparent house.
2,Keep searching,"Looking for a little inspiration and always up for a good adventure, I relied on a few of the reviewers here who touted this book's ""inspirational"" qualities. Well, I finished the book, and I'm still looking. The stories are mildly entertaining accounts of the author's tv documentary, but I hardy found myself inspired (okay, that's a lie -- the irridescent pink and yellow accents on the cover did give me a jolt). I wish I'd saved the $16 and gotten it from the library. Oh well."
4,For all the wanderers...,"I thought this book was fabulously entertaining and inspiring for Women and men. Holly Morris is balls out doing her thing and making it alsmost seem normal. Her strong brave spirit have led her to some amazing, exotic places and it's great to meet the people ( especially Divas) in writintg from the comfort of my bed. This books speaks to the Diva in me and somehow normalizes my tendencies and urgencies to fleed the scene at any given moment. At a time in my life when I spend majority of my day at a desk in front of a computer, Adventure Divas is the fix I need to make me remember....the world is waiting! Viva Divadom!"
3,Ho hum,"So-so. I found the interview subjects moderately interesting, but it's a bit of a stretch to believe real adventure happens with a tv crew following your every move-- armchair adventurers looking for a good read are going to be disappointed by this one. The concept bites off more than it can chew: feminist interviews/tv production/international travel/adventure, etc., so the end product is a more than a little disjointed."
3,Didn't really grab me,"I'm an intrepid traveler and an avid reader of anything adventure-related. This book had some funny travel moments for me, but I never found myself engaged enough by the author on a personal level or the stories to feel the kind of inspiration I like to get from a good adventure. I also felt the concept was a little too gimmicky and stories too short to deliver any major insight about the cultures the author (briefly) addresses. Anyway, overall it wasn't bad, but it just didn't hold my attention for any length of time."
4,Good Book to Learn About Travel T.V. Shows,"The book was entertaining for me, but I can see how it would be boring for other folks. I love the television series, ""Globe Trekker,"" so when she wrote about doing shoots for them, I was fascinated. Ms. Morris comes across lighter and funnier in her book than she does on the series.It was insightful to see the problems associated with the logistics, interviewing and shooting a show. Ms. Morris added humor to the problems that happen while traveling.Most importantly, Ms. Morris did give a sense of the struggles experienced by the women she interviewed. I actually was afraid of the aftermath that some of them would face because of their interviews. It truly shows how brave these women were.I can't wait to see the actually videos of the series."
2,Only practice tests,"I was looking for a book with the content that one must study for this test. This book only has practice tests, some rather old, for the Praxis II ESOL test."
4,Captivating,Ms Buchi Emecheta is indeed one of the leading lights documenting the experience of Africans in the diaspora.She is indeed gifted.In this book which deals with the gradual emigration of a Jamaican family to England and the trials and tribulations they face there.It also deals with the issue of sexual abuse and incest and the damage it has on the family. The main character is a girl who lived with her grandmother in Jamaica for some years before joining her parents in England.It also has as a subtheme how the Black immigrants generally live in the U.K.I would indeed recommend it wholeheartedly to everybody.When you talk about Interpreters of Maladies the award winning book know that Ms Emecheta was indeed making chronicles of the African experience in the diaspora 20 years before that.
5,"Reference Quality, and I'm not a big fan of the engineer's followers","I am not a huge fan of the nasty kool-aid drinking followers of the man who mastered this SACD. With that said, this SACD of After Midnight is incredible. It beats all the slabs of vinyl I have for this album. It envelops my listening area so nicely it's hard to believe its ""only"" mono. Don't let petty bias' or politics stop you from picking up this truly reference quality SACD"
2,Not wha tI hat hoped,"When I bought these I bought them as a gift for my mother who loves art scenes such as these the display picture that is show for the product shows it as a mostly clear detailed image I know that the actual product is going to be a little less detailed but I am highly dissatisfied with these coasters they came to me dull and some of them you can even see the wood grain pattern through the image which distorts the image even more. Also one of the coasters had some type of black smudge on it that we had to clean off. I expected a better product for what I paid. I also don't like that there where only four coasters in this package I would have rather gotten more bulk but since I got nether bulk nor quality.I should make a note that I would not have bought these if they where not for a gift, now that I have received them I will not be purchasing anymore."
3,Good movie,"his is a typical Hindi 80's dacoit drama type of film.Satyadev (Vikram Gokhle), his wife Ganga (Rakhee) and their two little children's Sham & Ghansham were living happily together. Unless, Bhim Singh (Amrish Puri), a new corrupt collector came in the village and started showing his brutality. Satyadev challenged him but was sadly killed. Ganga had to fly away with their children from Bhim Singh. Later those two children grew up (Arbaaz Khan & Chandrachur Singh) and decided to take revenge for their father's death."
4,A Bum's Life,"This is an intriguing, and often graphically insightful experiment into the psychology of the homeless and into the sociology of how we perceive them and react to them. Dawson pulls no punches with his word for word accounts straight from the mouths of the homeless in their various states of sobriety and intelligence. I have even more conflicting views on the homeless now, but I certainly will never look at them the same way again.David,Los Angeles."
1,Very disappointing experience,"I subscribed to Today's Caregiver October 2008 (subscription paid in full when ordered via Amazon); when I didn't receive the December 08 issue, I contacted the magazine and was told my subscription would begin February 2009. February came and went, no magazine. I contacted the magazine again, was told I would receive the next issue - it never arrived. I emailed the magazine June 09 to inquire about the missing issues; there was no response. This month I received a renewal notice by email. Again, I contacted the magazine only to find each menu option resulted in a recording to leave a message. Given its dismal track record, I will not renew and given my experience, I cannot in good conscience recommend a subscription to this publication."
3,Pluto: Vol 2: The Soul's Evolution Through Relationships,The book itself is great but it stinks so much from cigarettes that i can't read it. it might be the last time i buy a used book.
4,Comprehensive Read,"The sections on Venus and Mars through the signs are worth the price of the book all on their own. I found it to be a very detailed and well researched read. The author takes the time to walk the reader step-by-step through the interpretations and therefore this gives the aspects more relevance. I liked the fact that he did not shy away from the more ""base"" aspects. He delved into past lives, sado-masochism and sexual aspects with a fine-toothed comb. Another thing I liked was his use of the asteroids. So many ""astrologers"" write books with no mention of them. Astrology is certainly not a ""science"" of absolutes. But I take my hat off to the author who researches and incorporates the use of more than just the ""usual aspects"". Other authors in this field would should take pointers. For those readers who have grown tired of the usual astrology ""cookbooks"", sun sign generalizations and boring (read sedate) chart profiles, this book and others by this author may well be for you."
5,A Rare Gem,"Having read many books on astrology, this book raised my awareness level ten fold. Extraordinary writings, yet written in simple language, revealing an uncommon depth of perception and understanding of the planets and their relationships to one another. I learned more from this book than with my therapist. Truly remarkable."
5,Accurate reflections of relationships,"I currently have Pluto conjuncting my Sun and wanted to understand the affects of Pluto on my life... I got more out of this book about my relationships, their purpose and the overall affect of the relationship...the lessons learned. It was accurate insights and reflections of the situation. I now figure out the composite Pluto for friends and family and understand the purpose of the agreement with each person.It has changed and added to my perspective and my spiritual journey in many ways. I highly recommend if you want to know why someone is in your life... read this book. It gives me peace of mind and direction."
3,pluto lessons,"This book was sometimes straightforward, clear and easy to apply for my beginner astrology skills.And then suddenly it wouldn't be.The parts I liked were concrete examples of tendencies of ""if then, then that"", so that I could use the information to my life.Overall the book is engaging and sympathetic, just uneven in being sometimes broad, sometimes theoretical, sometimes practical."
5,Souls journey,Brilliant Soul level insight that I am utilizing in my work on Venus and Self-Esteem - My passion is to increase self-Esteem love and compassion through deeper self-knowledge. thank you!
5,The pinnacle of Bluegrass entertainment !!!,"I was blown away !!! The energy Rhonda Vincent brings to the stage is absolutely incredible, a stage full of musicians second to none. This by far the best DVD I have ever seen. The outtakes, photo gallerys only magnify the spectacle----ENJOY!!!"
5,Ronda Vincent and the rage DVD,"WOW!!! That's all I have too say! This piece is wonderful! If you like Bluegrass, and are looking for a very well recorded concert, this is the one for you! Absolutely fabulous..."
5,A music/bluegrass inspiration to anyone,"Rhonda Vincent is a little bundle of talent and energy. It's said, ""she's a looker, but hard to work for."" That must be because all her musicians are top talents with amazing skill on many instruments. It's an extreme joy to see her and all of them perform !!!Keep on ragin', sweet Missouri gal !!![I'm part of the West clan - Greencastle way back.]"
4,Thought provoking,"I loved this book of Hanson's. I lived in Arizona, also with a high immigrant population, and share many of Hanson's convictions. Contrary to what the Pat Buchanan types say, most immigrants do not come here with evil intentions. They are instead, sandwiched between a Mexican government which doesn't want them in Mexico, and counterproductive American policies such as bilingual education and multiculturalism, which help retard immigrants assimilation and rise into society. Short but clear book, filled both with knowledge and first-hand experience."
2,Pity Me,"I read Mexifornia soon after it was initially released. My feelings for the author and the book varied from pity to anger. ""Good Mexicans"" are those who attend his classes in the Classics. ""Bad Mexicans"" are usually ""Indians from the small towns"" and others who cling to their heritage and bring it with them. Hanson's historical amnesia excludes the fact that California was stolen from Mexico in a war of aggression so blatant that US Grant quit the army in disgust. Dr. Hanson happily earns a living on this stolen land and resents ""bad"" Mexicans from invading his private Anglodom. No mention of California Indians who no longer apparently exist. History is only for nice Anglophones in his home town, although ""some best friends"" are Mexican. No solutions here, just resentment for Mexican existence. Forget the book."
2,Show Me the Sources,"I sympathize with the problems the author faces as a result of illegal immigration, but I found many of the chapters to be little more than a rant about those problems. I was also dismayed to see that sources for the statistics the author used were not included in a reference list. As a matter of fact, there was NO reference list of ANY kind. I would have liked to have known where his informaion was coming from."
5,Thought provoking yet down to earth,"Hanson's style can be a little too intelluctual at times yet it is very clear and his points are well made.Here is someone descended from immigrants as many of us are and who has seen first hand the effects and benefits of the recent and constant flow of immigrants, legal and illegal. He describes quite clearly the role of assimilation into American culture and the effects of a failure to assimilate. He exposes the failures of the 'multicultural' approach and demonstrates the strengths of our multiracial country.Lastly, it is clear from his words that Hanson very obviously cares about these immigrants and wants to see them succeed and their children succeed. Finally someone courageously explores the issues surrounding immigration and race politics."
2,Mexifornia: A State of Becoming,"I purchased this book, Mexifornia: A State of Becoming. It was used and was guaranteed to be in ""like-new"" condition. I was amazed. It barely looked touched which is why I gave this purchase 2 stars. The condition was as promised. I am a college graduate and could barely understand this book. I needed a dictionary to read it and I still could not make sense of what the writer was saying."
5,A Professor of security studies,"Finally a balanced, sensitive, yet very pragmatic book on the whole immigration and culture debate. Hanson lays out the strong case that refutes the pro-immigration lobby and all the ethnic pride industry that has been built up around the cult of multiculturalism in the United States. The real question that comes out of the book is what has the Government of Mexico really done to take care of its citizens in the past 100 years? Not much, and it has effectively outsourced its problems to its neighbor to the north."
4,A Sobering View of Immigration From the Southern Border,"This is a must read for all Americans (of all races and colors) who are concerned with the immigration crisis (yes crisis) across our southern border. This book should be required reading for our politicians and educators who choose to seek band-aid approaches (sometimes for self serving reasons) to solving the far reaching issues discussed in this riviting work by Dr. Hanson. I couldn't put the book down but when I finished reading the book, I asked myself - - where do we go from here?"
5,Liberal Reviewers' condescension,"I have read many articles by Hanson, also his book on war. I'm going to buy Mexifornia as soon as I can because I just read a review by John Fonte ... Of course I wanted to read the liberal reviews on Amazon and naturally they hold true to form. Anyone they disagree with is stupid and not worthy of a PhD. I'm so sick of that argument, over and over again. ..., Hanson doesn't have to lie to support his position. ... It's too bad you'll never see Hanson receive the accolades from the press like Moore. But there's no such thing as liberal bias is there?"
1,Mighty foolish stuff!,"There is one, and only one, reason that our borders were never really closed- and that is because we *could not* close them. We could not do it in the past, and we can't do it now. Pick your own reasons- they will all be good- but I think the single strongest one is that it was, and remains, politically impossible, and becomes only more impossible as the Hispanic vote share grows. What changed was that things did not use to be so much better in the US than in Mexico... but now the gap is so large that the flood of migration northward is on. As the gap closes- as Mexican economics improve, and our need for cheap labor declines- so will the migrant wave.So all Hanson's talk is for naught."
1,"Man, the racism in this book & these reviews is frightening!","As a white Californian, I really feel for the Mexican immigrants who are up against the wall of racism as evidenced from this book and the sympathetic reviewers. NEVER underestimate the innate power of the ""us versus them"" reaction. Whew!Even for those who are racist though, on a purely pragmatic and even selfish level, we need to open the border with Mexico so that we can benefit from the influx of a young work force and thereby avoid the perils of the dropping birth rates in the First World (see Wattenberg's ""Fewer"" for details). Everyone will get richer simply from the influx, for as the lowest levels of the socioeconomic pyramid are filled by immigrants, the assets of those above automatically increase in value.But I'm sure I'm just whistling in the wind...so...WHY DONT YER JUST PACK THEM WETBACKS UP IN A BIG OLE BOX AN SHIP EM BACK TO WHAR THEY COME FROM DANG IT!There, did the majority of you readers like that better?Jeez!"
3,A book that seems to have found its audience,"I did not read this book, but I did read the first chapter and skimmed the rest. This is a dismal book, one that can be best summed up this way: It appeals to a certain kind of reader, which is apparently the same kind of reader who is also the television viewer of ""Jerry Springer."" As evidence, I offer Joseph D. Seckelman's review, a few down from mine: decrying that Latinos, by continuing to speak Spanish, are not learning English, I question his own command of the English language. He can't even spell A P A R T H E I D ... Thus the market for this book: illiterate English speakers. As Rick Ricardo would say: Mira que tiene cosas esta mujer! Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!"
1,Hanson is the Daddy of Hanson,"Lamer Daddy = Lamer Band.VDH thinks invading Iraq was a good thing, even though is was not a direct threat to the US.VDH thinks invading 'Mexicans' want to over run the US, even though much of the land was stolen by the US from the aboriginal population.Me thinks VDH is a hypocrite."
2,Mexifornia,"I had received several emails about this book from conservatives who indicated that it made a strong case for sending immigrants back to Mexico etc. I am for Comprehensive Immigration Reform and wanted to see what the big deal was. I was surprised that the book took a very humane position on the plight of immigrant workers. Only the last two or three pages of the book did he seem to present his alternative solutions. This may point out that there may be no real solutions to the problem, but that working together we might be able to improve our lot. He continually made the point that we need to be talking about the issue rather than taking hard line positions on both ends of the spectrum. I also believe that some things have changed since he wrote the book, including bilingual and emersion language studies for children (at least in Texas)."
3,"Good, but with exceptions ...","Handy phone, however very sensitive to wireless reception. The phone disconnects easy when the wireless strength is less than a quarter, which does not happen with other phones i.e. the Iphone from Linksys. Otherwise the phone is equal to and not really better. A good product with limits."
5,Cheap easy setup clear calls get one for yourself,"I bought this for [...] bucks at Fry's Electronics [...]. I set it up in about 10 minutes on my WEP enabled WIFI network, and was making calls in about 15 minutes. Clear call quality, I will be taking this phone with me when I travel to save my cell phone minutes."
3,It works but is unstable,"This phone did not live up to my expectations. The wifi connection is not stable enough for long conversations. Otherwise, it presents a good package and software. I suggest going for a wired solution with standard DECT communication from base to phone if you plan to replace your landline, and not carry the phone around."
3,Pros and cons,"Battery lasts one day, two at most (with low use).Network keeps on disconecting even when I'm 4 ft from my linksys router.Lacks from text messaging, ringtones or any utility software.The rest is ok"
2,Dopped Signal Dropped call,"I bought this phone for the main factor of it being wireless. The phone itself was not bad, however it would constantly loose our wireless signal and drop the call as well as signing out of skype. I would then have to reconnect to the network and call the person back. This was very annoying. Most of the time it would do this in 40 min intervals but sometimes it would do it more. I am not sure why it would drop the signal as our laptop sitting in the same room would still be connected. I felt the phone was not worth the 150 so I took it back disapointed."
1,phone charging relies on damage prone usb connector,"This phone comes with no charging cradel. To charge the phone you must plug a USB cable into the phone. The charging connector on the phone is not easy to plug into and is not meant to have a USB cable inserted into it multiple 100's of times. I've seen the same charging connector on GPS units ruined from too many insertions or ruff treatment while charging.There is a one year warranty and the USB charging connector is sure to suffer damage.Funny thing is, the phone is outfitted with charging contacts for a cradel. Why does Belkin build functional charging contacts into the phone and not sell a charging cradel?"
2,Belkin WiFi - Lousy Battery Life,Lousy battery life. Can't get through a conversation that lasts longer than about 1h. The phone does not even indicate that it is running out of power. Also annoying: It freezes up and takes up to 10sec to recover. Never sure if waiting or power cycling is more efficient. All in all very poor price performance ratio.
1,More trouble than its worth,"Although a great concept, it is not yet well executed. The menus and set up are quite a chore even for a techie, because entry of all the technical details is through the slow telephone keypad (imagine SSIDs and passwords and other details all through a telephone keypad). This means that if your time is worth more than five bucks an hour, its not worth the savings you get to enter all of the information, UNLESS you are just using this on one or a few networks all the time. Even for that, I still found it so discouraging that I have not used it. The first one's screen broke just having it in my luggage, so not sure how durable it is. The second one had the same problems as the first one. So...not recommended."
1,Not Ready For Prime-Time,"I was very disappointed to read all of these nice reviews on this product. Out of the other candy-bar style Skype phones, this looked to be the winner. I am attempting to connect to an Airport Extreme Base Station with WEP security (tried both 40bit and 128bit). The phone simply won't connect. I bought this for my parents so that they would have a simple, no-nonsense skype setup. Something that would be less complicated then using their computer to make phone calls. Well, back to the computer. The bugs haven't been worked out yet and if you need to connect to a network that requires a 'terms of agreement' form (uh, most of the hotels and airports and public wifi requires this) you are SOL. Wait six months and try again when they hit version 2.5."
5,All Around Great Phone!!!,"I am in love with this Phone!! After waiting for this phone to come out for months it does not dissapoint. The Black design is sleek and screen is bright and clear. The user interface is very easy to use and it makes calling your skype buddies fun and easy. I showed my mom who has never even used skype before and she was able to call my sister who is away at school without my help at all. Showing my friends this phone has definitely created some converts to this new technology that is going to be huge. Overall with this phone being 50 dollars cheaper than netgears, and the fact that it uses Boingo software to connect to its 60,000 hotspots worldwide, buying this phone was a no brainer. I Recomend this phone to anyone that likes to keep in touch with friends and family over long distances, a skype fan, or to anyone looking for the next coolest gadget to show off to all their friends."
2,The Phone Is OK - But has problems,I agree with some of the posters on here. The phone feels real cheap and the buttons are hard to push. The battery life is bad. I leave the phone hooked up to the charger and if I make a call- you have about 30 mins of battery before it dies.Phone call quality is good and it does interfase with Skype well. If the phone was 49.95- it say it was good deal. It is no way a 150.00 phone.
1,"DON'T BUY IT, IT'S WASTE OF MONEY!!!","The phone looks really nice. But it works terrible drops connection, you can hear echo, you can hear with a daily. I own Linksys CIT200, even thou is not Wi-Fi its USB much better has even speaker phene Belkin doesn't. Don't buy. You will be disappointed. I just retuned it because was fed up."
2,Buy with caution,"I've had this phone for a couple months and it is functional, but I would NOT buy this product again. The phone is VERY finickey about staying connected to a STRONG wi-fi signal onle feet away. I usually have to reconnect and redial several every few minutes during a conversation....which is VERY annoying!I was hoping for a firmware update to help solve the connectivity problems, but the last version is from 2007 which tells me this product is not well supported from Belkin.I suggest shopping around for another product....my lesson is that there is a reason why this phone is CHEAP on some sitesGood Luck"
3,Skype Portable Phone,"The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes I have to reconnect to the wireless signal. Other than that, I like it. It doesn't have to many features to choose from and is a very simple product. I think it is overpriced a bit, but I haven't found another portable Skype phone that is better."
2,Not a good product,"Aside from the display looking and working like a cell phone from 7 years ago, this Skype phone is CONSTANTLY disconnecting from my wireless network. It goes through these periods where it disconnects, connects, disconnects, connects, disconnects, connects, disconnects for about 10 minutes straight, a few times a day. Really annoying when I'm trying to sleep and it basically turns into an alarm clock, making the disconnect/connect noises over and over. It's also annoying when I get disconnected during a call because of it.There's nothing wrong with my home network. I live in a small one bedroom apartment, I'm using an Apple Airport Extreme, and none of my other devices have any trouble (Windows XP PC, Macbook Air, iPhone and PS3).I do not recommend this. Try one of the competing phones, instead."
2,Not Reliable,"I have had this phone for almost a year now, and rarely use it, because no matter what type of router I use it constantly drops calls. Even in areas with bad coverage, my cell phone is more reliable than this. I originally intended it to be my work line, however, that wasn't an option due to the fact it only stays connected to a call about 40% of the time. Don't waste your money."
1,do not buy this phone,this phone just keeps on dropping the network i have e-mailed numerous times to support at belkinand tried to call with no luck at all tech support over e-mail say's reprogram the phone and i keep telling themI have and it is still the same so much for support belkin get a life I am going for the philips
4,Excellent phone,"This is a value purchase. Phone numbers are stored and calling out is easy from an open network. However, in downtown San Francisco I could never find an open network to make a call. Also it should have a charger like other phone rather than a plug."
2,Needs improvements,"I never tried any other skype phone but after reading reviews and reviewing netgear and other phones I purchased two of these phones.Everything was kind of what expected and I was impressed by the phone but as i used it more, i missed lot of sms as this phone didn't support it. Other thing i didn't like was the phone getting hot at the ear piece side after half an hour or more... i know that cell phone connected to adparter while talking get hot but this thing was getting hot without the wire connect, it is weird that it is getting hot for just being used and that was one major reason for my return."
5,Excellent quality,"I have had my phone for about a month now and am very happy. The configuration was easy and only took about 5 mins, the battery life is excellent, and the sync between adding, renaming, removing contacts from either the phone or computer is excellent. And most of all the sound quality is just like a cell phone it's next to perfect. This one item has saved me over two hundred dollars this month alone just form my wife talking to her mom on it verses the cell phone. The one inconvenience that I noticed was when my WIFI would cut out randomly (as they do some times) the phone would notify me with a very obnoxious tone but I was able to disable the audio notification of loss of network and all is good."
2,Shop around...,"My boyfriend got this in March 2007 when we decided to use Skype instead of a landline. So most of my review is just for home use. I also don't know if there's a better phone out there. (I hope so)First this phone truly does not deliver.It:-has a short battery life-shuts down while you're on a call-resets on its own for no reason-shuts down while you have it plugged in, so everything rolls to voicemail-clock does not reflect daylight savings, it's always off-people from the other end hear echo-while my laptop shows very strong wifi connection, the phone shows two bars maxI still gave it some stars because I like the idea of a WiFi phone. But really, it makes me want to have landline phone!"
2,If you want,If you want to talk with a delay and with an echo.. this is the phone for you. I was not to impressed by it. Battery power is good for about 4 calls and half a day tops.The mini usb charging is pretty cool and the phone connect to wifi easy but over all value drops when I gotta talk to people like its a cb radio and the other person has an echo.
1,Simply doesen't work,"Looks that it connects and can call out fine but after 10 minutes you are lost..No matter if you upgrade firmware, issue persists.Don't buy it."
2,Not that great...,This phone looks good and was easy to set up but the lag in the conversation is painful. My normal skype on my computer is fine but when I use this wireless phone there i noticeable lag and sometimes an annoying echo.
2,"Nice product, but needs work","Nice idea, but no speaker phone, and the earpiece volume and ringer was too low to keep it."
2,Working but...,"The phone came with old firmware (September), was working pretty good, but when I was online, my friends see my as offline (and all calls were forwarded to my cell phone). So I decided to upgrade the firmware to the newest one from Belkin website (December). After successfull upgrade the issue wasn't fixed and unfortunately it started to restart/freeze at least once per day. The volume keys are not working sometimes, the charge icon shows charging when it's not. Belkin support is horrible, after making about 5 calls, I finally get to the lady who wrote down alle the issues and promes to forward the to level 2 technical support, didn't heard from them till now."
2,Poor sound quality: Serious delay and echo,"The sound quality of Skype via Wif-fi with the Belkin phone shows 2 serious problems: Delay and echo. The quality is poorer than normal Skype quality (which is not always great to begin with). The sound quality is so poor that I cannot use the phone as much as I intended.1. DelayWith the wifi phone, there is at least a 1-second delay in outgoing direction.2. EchoThere is a serious echo in outgoing directionI have tested with 2 different wi-fi base stations (both with WEP encryption). I have the same problems with both."
1,HORRIBLE... get the NetGear one instead,"This product is the worst. I should've read the reviews before getting it. Plug-n-play... not even close. Would not connect to my LinkSys router even with my settings as wide open as Lindsay Lohan. The user interface is clumsy and the tech support was a joke. When I started asking some tough questions about the device, the poor guy on the other line I think started to cry. Anyway, I bought the NetGear SPH200w and it worked right out of the box. Excellent job, nicely done. User interface was intuitive and setup was a piece of cake. I am an IT guy and I probably could've forced the Belkin device to work but that was not the point... the point was that Belkin represents this product as something my technophobiac parents could use and that is simply just not true. Again, get the NetGear."
2,Fine but Very Few Connections,"Mine had worked OK. Sounds fine. However, there are very few places it connects. It won't connect if a username and password are required, no way to enter those. At many open wifi spots it gives a cannot connect to the Internet message. It will only connect in very few places. Beware."
4,Great phone -- needs longer lasting battery,The phone was easy to set up and works perfectly -- no more being tied to the computer. The battery lasts less than 2 hours. I contacted Belkin and was told they don't sell replacement batteries for backups. I was able to find a similar battery with charger on ebay. It's a camera battery and I didn't see any similar sold in the U.S.
2,Skyp Phone,"This tool is good only in an unsecured netwek zone. Public zones i.e., airports, hotels etc., you can not access. This make the phone fairly useless."
2,Just didn't work well enough,"I'm pretty tech and web savvy - and the phone DOES work....but absolutely not as a home phone replacement. Its a gadget, and be prepared to fiddle with it often. It also drops calls 50% of the time, even when I'm well within wifi range. It does work, but not well enough for $100."
1,Totally unhappy with he phone and Skype. I have purchased Time Warner phone servise.,"Quality is poor (echos, time lapses between words). Would not recommend to anyone.Would return it if possible."
2,Belkin Skype phone.. it's ok,"The phone is just okay.. Not nearly as good as calling through the computer.. it drops calls all the time, even if you are standing next to the router. It also freezes all the time and has to be reset to work. With that said, for the price it's ok. Nothing to write home about, but it'll do."
4,Belkin Wi-Fi Phone,"I have been able to connect to a few hotspots, but whenever I dial a telephone number it comes up invalid. I have not been able, my own lack of ability, to actual make a call as of yet to truly rate this product. I do love the idea of flexibility in being able to make calls when I am away from my computer."
2,Dissapointing Performance,"I ordered this and then returned it about a month later.Set up was easy enough and everything seemed fine. The phone appeared to have connected to Skype just fine.However, about half the time, if someone would call my Skype-In number, the phone just wouldn't ring and their call would go straight to voice mail. It could have been a defective unit, but for some reason the product just didn't work for me."
3,"A looker, works at home wifi, but not in hotel or Starbucks","Agree with the previous reviewer: it only works in the unsecured network. Tried and failed in hotel and Starbucks. So not as useful as I originally thought it would be.Pro: look and feel.Con: slow startup, data loading, can't be used outside my home so far.Un tested: battery and talk time. Sound quality is ok. Not great, but ok. No worse than the PC headphone/mike combo.Bottom line: It's cutie and purchase at your own ""risk""."
3,Buyer beware: this will ONLY work with Skype,"I bought the phone under the impression that it was a fully customizable WiFi phone that I could use with a Gizmo5 (now Google Voice) account. This phone only works with Skype accounts and Skype credits. I was disappointed, but that's not why the phone only gets 3 stars. I used the free 30 minute Skype credit that came with the phone to try it out and I was still fairly disappointed. The software is very limited and simple and the phone could not consistently maintain a WiFi connection to my router despite several tests and reconfigurations.You may have better luck with the phone based on your setup; there are a lot of variables, but I wouldn't call this a phone for power users (and I can't say I ever had the chance to try the Boingo feature). This is just a way to make Skype calls. For similar money, you could probably find an older generation 8GB iPod touch and just run the free Skype app with a set of headphones."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this phone when I got a skype line at my new apartment. The phone came quickly which was great because I was using my line through my laptop. After a year I am still finding this a disappointing purchase, for almost $200 I would like the phone to work. It drops calls a lot and is always disconnecting from the wifi. I have also noticed that it holds a lower charge then my cell phone. If I even want to make one phone call I have to make sure it has a full charge because if it doesn't it will go dead during the call. My friends have a cheaper version of this phone, and are very happy with it. I thought this one would be just a little nicer so figured I would try it, but I am not enjoying it."
4,100% WiFi Skype Phone - but nothing else,"The Belkin Skype Phone does exactly what it claims; acts as a standalone Skype node when connected to a nearby WiFi hotspot. The calls are clear, the battery life is good, it can store your Skype contacts - all very handy. Don't expect it to do much else that mobile phones do, though - there's no camera, no audio or video players, no storage (other than the friends list etc. in RAM), no address book, extra wallpapers, ringtones...The enclosed USB cable can't be used for syncing or to use it as a USB handset when WiFi is unavailable; it's only for recharging the handset from a USB socket when the charger's out of reach.Perfectly capable item, but completely frill-free."
1,Creates more trouble than help,"The phone concept is good, but the extremely slow software (even after updating the firmware) makes it useless. Yesterday I broke the phone in two pieces and throwed it on the bin.To make a single phone call could take upto five minutes, as the phone freeze and does not respond. If it ever works the quality is in most cases very good.Not recommended."
2,"Frequent wireless disconnection, bad sound quality","I had this phone about almost a month, got a replacement by Amazon. But I am still having problems with it. First time, the volume adjustment dead screen made me replace the phone. I got the replacement, but it disconnects frequently that sometimes makes you feel like throwing it away. I am a loyal customer of Amazon. I think Amazon should not sell this kind of product to ruin its reputation. I would say, if you want to talk on skype, just buy $10 wire headset and enjoy your conversation. Don't waste money on this. I just got a replacement and don't want to degrade my amazon credit for this kind of product, but it is 100 bucks. I might return it."
1,Dead on arrival nothing more to say!,its all in the title. Nice to say Amazon arranged for ups to pick up and after awhile I received a full refund. So no lasting damage. my replacement was the Netgear unit. Sorry unable to make comparison.
4,keeping in touch,"We have skype at home and use this phone as a portable extension, but also take it one the road. We just came back from Israel. There were unsecured hotspots everywhere and we were able to keep in touch with friends and family at home easily and cost-free. We were also able to call people and businesses in Israel at nominal cost.When the phone is on standby the battery runs down in about 24 hours, a lot faster than most cell phones. Longer charge life would be helpful. It also will occasionally lose its connection even though the signal is good. Although it quickly re-establishes the link, a call may be interrupted in the process. This is a problem that needs some attention.Given satellite connectivity, it would be truly sensational.I see an item 'tag this product' below, which I don't understand, so I'll have to skip it."
3,"it works, but","The phone works but it does tend to drop out if you move around too much while you are using it. We have a lot of thicker walls in our house so it may be that we need something with a bit more power. Will be taking it on our next holiday to use in hotels with free wifi, so will see how we go. It is definitely saving us money versus having a home phone service."
1,Piece of Crap Useless Waste of Time,"This is a useless product. The calling quality is terrible. I use my itouch in the same network and the quality is 50x better. It really is a joke that Skype is even worth anything as a business because in general the call quality is so low....but with this handset it really is unusable.Also, the 30 minute skype out voucher it came with - doesn't work. Have been on phone with Belkin customer service for 30 minutes, the indians have no idea what's going on.Finally, it doesn't work on other networks. Only your home network, this is because most networks require a web browser to login. Which this uselss device doesn't have.Complete waste of money.Use your itouch/iphone instead."
2,Dis not work during my trip to France and Italy,"I have used the regular Skype system for many years and thought that using the wi-fi skype phone was going to solve my problem to make phone calls during my travels out side the U.S.On june I bought the the Belkin Skype phone and went happy to my vacation trip ( France and Italy ) . Well...and guess what happened? During one month exactly that lasted my trip, I was not able NOT EVENG ONCE, to use this phone.....It was impossible to get connection anywhere.Now I use it at home...and the only difference is that I spent 120 US$..to make calls from my own home, instead of headphones, but for travel unfurtunatly didn't work at all"
1,Nightmare,"After I updated my Belkin Skype phone[...] I was asked to restart this phone. When I restarted my phone, Only the first page (Belkin) is shown up. It can't be turned off, either."
2,3 Unforgivable Problems,"It would be great if this worked well. The battery meter isn't accurate; it actually jumps around every so often, sometimes saying it's 3/4 full, sometimes 1/4, always ""Full"" when I try to charge it, and every so often it dies without warning.The buttons aren't hard to push, but much too easy to enter too many; I often type too many of a letter, and end up deleting more than I wanted when I try to fix my mistake. It doesn't have any intelligent software to sense how many times I meant to push the button, I suppose.I also can't get the screen to shut off. It has a screen shut off option in the settings, and I have it set to ""1 minute"", but after an hour it won't go into standby. This I expect is a problem unique to my phone, but it's very frustrating.Otherwise, I like the actual working parts of this; I don't need my computer on, it feels nice in my hand, and I can go scouting the neighborhood looking at the names of people's wireless router networks."
3,Wish the battery life was better,Main issue with this set is the low battery life. Other than that it does what it is supposed to.
1,Spotty Service,"I used a cheap USB Skype phone that I purchased for <$10 and it worked great. Quality was great and never a dropped call. But I would like to have a WIFI one without depending on the computer being on. So I purchased this one since it was certified by Skype.The phone worked somewhat, but the quality was real poor and not comparable to other connected USB phones and wired headsets. And forget about comparing it to a landline or a cell phone. I tried it at home (cable ~10mb down/~1mb up) and work (DSL ~5mb down/~1mb up) and at both locations, the phone quality was subpart. It dropped calls a few times too.Actually my <$10 USB phone sounded better than cell phone, and almost as good as my landline.I wouldn't recommend it. I returned it after a few days of use. Good thing AMAZON.COM has a great return policy and service."
2,Low ring,"I bought this product but returned it. Technically, phone works fine; however, its ring tone is too low and I felt that was going to be an inconvenience. So I sent it back. But like I said the phone works fine + it was easy to make it connect to the router."
4,a good value but poor quality and bad support from Belkin,It works like a cell phone around house with 802.11 network connection. It is convenient and you can call people around-the-world with cheap phone bills. However the product was poorly made with back cover as thin as a paper. I broke the back cover when I trid to open it up to install the battery. I called the Belkin and try to get a replaced back cover. They asked me to send back the whole phone. I explained to the support quy that I just need a back cover and my phone worked fine. But he follow the book and I must send the phone in order to get the back cover replaced.My recommendation if you can find a similar phone and under $100 get it. So far Belkin maybe the only one under $100.
3,Incorrect sizing,"The product was perfect in terms of quality and functionality, but sizing was wrong. I expect medium to fit a waistline of between 30-36, but this was way too small, and should have been labeled small. At least the vendor should have provided a sizing table on the web site if their sizing is non-conventional. Luckily someone else was able to use this support. It's a hassle to return and reorder."
1,"Plus size isn't very ""plus""","Admittedly, I run into this a lot with all kinds of stockings and pantyhose. I was hoping for an inexpensive pair for one occasion, but they didn't fit my thighs at all. I know I have large thighs, that's why I ordered plus size, but it needs more stretch at the top to actually work. Can't speak to the quality of the actual stockings as I was unable to actually wear them."
2,run easily- i paid too much at 2.50,"I think these are really low quality....they are wear once type of stockings. if you are extremely careful with them.....you might get away with wearing them twice. I kind of knew these would be cheap, but I'm a sucker for a deal. If you are going to buy them--and you've got long legs and are at all thick in the thighs--I mean at all-....they are going to be short-low on the thigh. The seam is nice, but they really are thin and cheap."
5,Love the Stockings,"I love the nude back seam stockings. I love their silky texture. I am tall - 5'11"" - but still find them adequate in length, even though they are one size fits all. I have discovered, though, that it is best to wear gloves when putting them on (and taking them off) as any roughness on the hands or nails will catch on them and slightly snag them. However, the snags do not result in runs, it just takes away from their smooth appearance. I will undoubtedly be ordering more in the future."
3,Good fit; seam isn't black like I thought,"I ordered these in nude (I guess the color option is referring to the back seam?). These fit surprisingly well as I am 5'1"" and am underweight. The texture is very silky but I am worried they may snag easy."
5,Cheaper then Victoria's Secret,I am plesed with these. It is not always easy to find stockings or nylons with a back seam. But I always get compliments when wearing them. My previous pair came from Victoria's Secret. This is much more affordable. Who knew you could look sexy and classy at the same time. Give yourself a treat.
3,okay. They do not feel great,I am more into the way Hanes feel. These look good but do not feel that great. They also fit a little loose on my girlfriend.
1,wont run/after 1month use,"I used my humidifer for one month,got it out and filled.nothing happened.all controls light up,so i know there is power to the unit.I cleaned it good before storing it last year.i have given up on sunbeam humidifers.Ibuy a new one every year.i always use bottled water.I feel it is a waste of money to buy any more of them."
5,"Last stop, The End of History","This is a short version, upgraded, of S. Moore's _Marx on the Choice between Socialism and Communism_. The author's argument is:""Pointing out that Marx deffines communist economies as classless economies without markets, this book examines his claim that classless economies with markets are in some sense inferior to communist economies. From its analysis, two conclusions emerge. First, Marx's major arguments for abolishing commodity exchange rely on moral and philosophical premises, derived from Feuerback in the earlier writings and from Hegel in the later. Second, Marx's ideal of a communist economy is incompatible with his materialist approach to history...'Your move."
2,HEAR IT BUT DON'T SEE IT,"Both sound and performance are very good, but for god's sake how could you have such a bad picture? Lightening is very bad and the images are terribly hazy. Only the closeup images are clear (when the focus is right). In such a modern filming I would expect a much much better image."
5,A Very Good Discovery,"This modest little volume, almost devoid of text, is a nicely-printed collection of patterns by a lesser-known but very worthy deco stylist, Serge Gladky, who was apparently one of the pioneers of the movement. The restrained and intelligent color palette is perhaps the most striking feature of his work; his use of shapes is even more mathematical than a collection of patterns would imply. It's a useful and inspiring resource for designers and afficianados, and the material richly deserves to be preserved and presented."
5,Excellent...as was her live performance!,"Love the album. I had the opportunity to see Rhonda Vincent and the Rage @ Fort Benning and they put on a great show, playing a majority of the songs on this CD. After the concert I purchased this CD and it was like I never left the concert on post. A+! Looking forward to more."
4,Great for a live album,Actually very good to have been recorded live. She is very talented. You can't even tell that the album is live except at the beginning and end of the songs when everyone's clapping. If you like this type of music and/or her then I recommend it.
5,Ragin' Live,A top shelf bluegrass band- second to none. Rhonda Vincent is Bluegass - the genunine article
4,A Different Shade of Bluegrass,"I had the opportunity to see Rhonda and the Rage at Johnston County Community College in Smithfield, NC recently. I was NOT a bluegrass fan...but Rhonda is NOT the bluegrass I was thinking about. She's an awesome entertainer, not just talented but so energetic, and so in touch and in tune with the audience. Her current single of I've Forgotten You is awesome...and even CMT thought so and featured it several times on their Wide Open Country programming. This Live CD is like being right there at the concert all over again. I'm not a fan of live performances but this one is awesome."
3,great in theory,"One did fit, but alot of extra you will never use. We just plug the tip into the computer with other end charging phone. The Ziplinc gives more mobility, but ""attachment"" actually worked without it. Also, I wish pictures or info on exactly what tip fit what would have been helpful. e.g. This tip fits this make and model phone. That said once you figure what fits what its a great product."
3,"Old sci-fi, almost comical....","It brought back a lot of memories of movies I watched as a young person. Compared to today's pictures, it is comical...."
2,wvchotfudge,"I ordered a case of these cookies and thought it would be something my cookie monsters would love but they sat around for a very long time and only slowly got eaten. I think I actually gave away some of them just to not through them out! Sorry to say, they were not a big hit with the family. I would not recomend this product because if my cookie monsters didn't goble them up yours probably won't either!"
5,Good listenin' all the way through,"There aren't too many CDs you can listen to all the way through without a bad patch. For me, this is one of those golden records. Cale is awesome, and I recommend it to anyone. From easy listeners to rock and rollers to country kickers, all will enjoy this one."
2,------------------------------- --------------------------,Let me start of by saying I am a big Dead Milkmen fan. When I purchased this disc for the collection I was very dissapointed. This cd was made from two different recordings. One is at a party and is just unbearable to listen to. The other recording is from a radio show they did. The radio one is whole lot easier to listen to. My promblem with it is the music is edited. If anything edited music offends me. The only reason I gave the cd to stars is because there the Dead Milkmen. Don't be fooled this isnt a collection of there best material or a greatest hits cd. Go buy there other cds you wont be sorry
5,After A While - Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"Ain't this guy just somethin'? !! True Texas home grown. Another Great Album by Jimmie Dale and if you like his style and his music, you'll like what's on this CD. I had to give it 5-Stars !"
4,One Of Nashville's Great Unappreciated Voices,"It's say to say the song that attracted me to this album was the only one on the album he didn't write himself. ""My Mind's Got A Mind Of Its Own"" is a happy little party tune by fellow neglected country artist Butch Hancock. Still, as both a singer and a songwriter, Gilmore ranks with Hancock, Iris DeMent, and Hal Ketchum as one of the great country artists neglected by the press of hat acts like Garth Brooks and Alan Jackson, who are to be avoided by purists."
5,Great for baby meds!,"We have been using these syringes for the past several months, four times per day, to dispense oral medications to our infant triplets. Washing between each use, I can use each syringe for 2-3 weeks before the markings have worn off. The 5 mL size is convenient for many medications. In fact, I find these syringes much easier to use than the droppers typically included with OTC medications such as children's tylenol, advil, etc."
5,Works well,I use these for giving my horse injections. They work fine. There is an excessive outer plastic part that is not necessary for me.
1,"Disgusting, biased, pro-Nazi","This book is the product of the Cold War. It says nothing of the at least 17 million Soviet civilians murdered or starved to death by the Germans. It is not accurate either. It is offensive and some would think Seaton is a Nazi apologist. When he describes Russian atrocities, he fails to say that there was no official policy of the killing of the Germans. Many Soviet commanders often had their soldiers court martialed or executed when the commanders visited the front. The Soviets rightfully felt hatred for these Nazis who started this war in the first place. During the Cold War, this book must be highly acclaimed by us. I also guess if this book is on sale in Germany (which it probably is) it is highly popular."
3,The Best of the Rest,"There is still no really good balanced single-volume or two-volume work on the Eastern Front, and most are riddled with errors (i.e. check their accounts of the Battle of Prokhorovka). Ziemke's books are certianly the most accurate overall, and would recommend them as a starting point. After that Erickson (although Werth is good for perspective). After that Seaton, even with its errors and ""German perspective"" is probably the best of the rest."
2,dry,"i am a big ""eastern front"" reader,and this book doesn't compare to Alexander werth's magnificent ""russia at war"",and it doesn't compare to Alan clark's outstanding ""barbarossa"" Seaton's book is too dry,too pro-nazi,and just doesn't convey to the reader the vast scope of this awesome event,the war between russia/germany,which was the greatest conflict in human history. Werth's book give's you a human look at the tragedy, and the scope of this world historcal event. Clarks' book is sweeping,and vibrant in it's reporting i loved the quotes from the german infrantrymen,and the descriptions of the ugly landscape,and the savage weather,all in all,Seaton's book is too dry,too antiseptic."
4,"Russo German War, 1941-45",Very well written book that goes into great details about the strategies of the war on the Eastern Front. The author does a very good job of detailing what both sides were doing and the reasoning behind their strategies. Found it an excellent read for anyone interested in that part of World War II history.
5,Very Good Military Study,"I found this book to be a very good detailed study of the Eastern Front from 1941-45, especially in terms of describing unit operations. I also found the detailing of German and Soviet economic factors rather interesting.I agree with another review that the author more than willing to state Soviet atrocities whilst German atrocities were barely mentioned. If anything, German atrocities were the equal of, if not worse, than Soviet atrocities, so I think author should have either mentioned the Nazi barbarities in more detailed or simply mentioned both in passing seeing how this was more of a military study."
5,Great book for the WW2 researcher.,"All in all a wonderful book that goes into great detail on the German and Russian side of WW2. This is a misunderstood area of the war by many Westerns, and this book was very educational. Great details and behind the scences information."
4,Try is a success,"Although, this isn't my favorite Bebo Norman CD, I cannot find much fault in it.Bebo's music rings with a simplicty and grace. Even with the simplicity, it is also woven into a fabric of great thought and wisdom.The lyrics ring true throughout the whole album.From Finding You""I'm finding you in everything that shinesI'm finding you in between the linesI'm finding youYou open up my eyes every time'Cause your love is so alive""To Other Side Of Day""When I'm falling in the shadows of the SonOnly You remain, the hope of what's to come.""Sit back and enjoy this album."
4,Bebo's growing up!,"I can understand the one reviewer's dislike of Bebo's newest album, however I don't agree. This album is different than his other albums, with this one being more direct lyrically. One thing I've always loved about Bebo is how his lyrics can affect you in different ways depending on your mood or other external circumstances. This album seems to be a little bit more poignant. One great example is song number 10, titled ""Yes I Will"". The lyrics are simply striking and to the point.Bebo's new married life has obviously played a huge role in his life and his new work definitely reflects it. The whole album just feels a little more ""grown up"". I still hold Bebo in the highest regard for his complex simplicity in writing truly genuine music."
3,It's No Wonder ....,"People for years have been drawn to this album for some unknown reason to them. Could it be the fact that Cougar hadn't quite found his way at that time and tried to emulate The Boss? Look at the composition of the lyrics and the way he modified his voice to fit Bruce's style. Don't get me wrong, I loved this album but it was so obvious to us at the time what Mellencamp was trying to do. The store owner of our local record shop would play this non-stop while betting the regulars ( this was a while ago remember) to whom was singing. We'd all be wrong thinking that he'd had gotten his hands on a bootleg. Still an enjoyable album especially if you love the Boss."
4,Lots of Atmosphere,"This is a great album that captures a late night atmosphere in a small town, as only John can do. This is slightly different than his later works, but it's cool to hear John use piano and do some mellow songs, as these became less common later on. This is pretty raw, but it sounds great. I would highly recomend this album."
5,His first album,"This one is extreemly hard to find. Most places don't even carry it. If you're a true Mellencamp fan, this is the one to get"
2,Still getting warmed up,"Don't expect any great John Mellencamp songs like ""Small Town"" or even ""Pink Houses"" on this album. Recorded back when he was still John Cougar, this album, like many of his early albums, proved he still had a lot of growin' up to do. In fact, except for the excellent single ""Ain't Even Done With the Night,"" in which he starts to show his songwriting abilities, there is little on this album to recommend. Stick to later period Mellencamp instead."
3,See it for acting not the plot,"This also wasent Pierce Brosnan personal favorit Bond movie with him in it (witch its was his secend Bond film) The DVD its self wasent all thet good if you Fast Foward threw it or stop it at certan points the color fades a little for a min and the sound starts to drop like toward the end of the movie this DVD was care-lessly transferd (my opinon) but I suggest buying the spical editon of Tomorrow never Dies witch features much more and doesnt have any sound problems. The acting was good to bad Pierce Brosnan puted a lot of efforit into it and got a bad movie rating, The Plot isnt real good at all, The villen and the cause of Bond stoping whatever happend was cheap I suggest buying Goldeneye or even The World is not Enough at least more storyline effort was puted into The Wrold is not Enough."
4,A Must See Movie for a Bond Fanatic,"Tomorrow Never Dies was a very well done movie and great adition to the Bond collection. I've had people tell me that they didn't like it because it isn't the way it used to be . Then I pointed out to them that it is a very good Bond movie, because the older Bond movies were always about being ahead of Technology, and James Bond saving the world. Well in this movie all of that and more happens. We see the new up-to-date James Bond. Also this limited edition DVD has many great extra features, which makes watching the movie even better. If you're debating whether or not to spend the movie for this movie, it is definetly a movie that you should highly consider."
4,"Very good job, but not as good as Goldeneye",This film is one of the best Bond films ever made. There was a lot of action but Goldeneye had that bit more.Pierce Brosnan is an excellent actor and portrays Bond's personality exactly.
5,great movie,"this limtied edition gift pack not only contains a great movie (tomorrow never dies) but it also containsa behind the scenes of t.n.d. and a script for the film......a little packet of pictures was included also as well as a certificate of authenticity and a ""Live Like Bond"" sweepstakes(end1-31-99)the movies in this set are great"
4,Not so bad!,"This is one of the weakest Bond films. But, this ""special edition"" DVD makes up for it with the ""extras"" and a stunning transfer - fantastic picture! The audio commentary is a bit boring though, which I found surprising!"
4,"Not Your Best Adventure, 007","Tomorrow Never Dies is a Bond movie too tragically caught by the 90's. The script was excellent on Bruce Fierstein's part, it's just that the storyline was slightly off par. Being a die hard James Bond fan, who is currently writing a book on him, I must say this movie was not one of the better ones. The vilain, superbly played by Jonathan Pryce was a contemporary of the 90's. Although his way of doing it was unexpected, his plan was not at all original. The best part of the film was the opening sequence, which was Bruce Fierstein's brainchild. It displayed a classic element of Bond as well as adding an ultramodern twist. A good movie, just not one of the better Bond films. To get a truly ""Bondian"" feel, read the novel by my good friend Raymond Benson."
2,"Oh Dear, What Happened Here?","After proving that there was life after Dalton with the credible ""GOLDENEYE"", the follow up film falls somewhat short, as a stunt training video, its a masterpiece, but with only the videocover to remind you it is indeed a story, it is disappionting. The Evil press baron is more Ian Hislop than Robert Maxwell and Teri Hatcher looks decidedly pregnant a times (at the time of filming she was indeed). Pierce Brosnan tries to be more Roger Moore than Roger Moore, and fails. However, they all redeemed themselves with ""The World Is Not Enough"" which is in a different class alltogether."
3,Pretty much action but little panache,"Since ""Tomorrow never dies"" is a James-Bond-film, one can be quite sure in advance that this film will neither be a complete disaster nor an all-time-classic (similar to the films of the ""Star-Trek""-franchise).This one stars Pierce Brosnan once again who is really an acceptable James Bond. But like his two films, he has only little panache. It would perhaps be unfair to blame him for that since the creators are only striving for spectacular action scenes. It's not that I don't like action but I think James Bond films must be different from other action films. They really need a touch of class. In this respect, the Brosnan-starrers have still plenty of room for improvement."
2,Even DVD doesn't help this Bond film.,"This was perhaps one of the worst Bond movies ever! A dry plot, uninteresting Bond girls, and a silly villain, make this movie down right boring. There were perhaps two action scenes that were a little exciting, but that is it! Although, one good quality this movie has is the intro. Sheryl Crow and that computer animation were a perfect match!!! It is TREMENDOUS on DVD!!! I also commend MGM for producing DVD's the RIGHT WAY. That is using hard plastic cases, both formats of the movie (widescreen and standard) on one side of the disc, and a nice display menu. Too often you find DVD only with the widescreen or in those cardboard snap cases, which I HATE!!! Thank you MGM!!!"
2,A bit tedious,"The final half hour is an overwrought shoot out aboard a stealth craft that is too long by 25 minutes. Nothing happens except a lot of fake bullets fly endlessly. Otherwise, the plot, thinly disguised as a spoof on Rupert Murdoch, involves the usual megalomaniac -in this case, a media mogul - bent on creating world havoc for his own gain. Brosnan is cool in the early going, and the opener, involving an arms bazaar and a nuclear bomb carrying jet fighter is great, as usual with Bond films. The story line overall is just so-so. The title track by Sheryl Crowe is one of the better Bonds."
4,Great as there is Michelle Yeoh,"This show is another typical Bond shows where you will get to see cool gadgets. However, different this time is the Bond girl. An Asian bond girl that kick...Michelle Yeoh really adds colours to this show. Overall, quite a nice and exciting show."
4,One of the Best Bond Movies,"Tomorrow Never Dies is one of the best Bond movies. Though I've enjoyed the later Bond movies starring Daniel Craig, I still think Pierce Brosnan was the better Bond, James Bond. Craig never seems like he's having any fun. Brosnan has the ability to show Bond enjoying himself, while still bringing a more realistic performance to a very non-realistic film genre. When Bond crashes down onto the Millennium Dome, Brosnan makes you feel Bond's pain (even if it is much less pain than a normal person would feel.) Bond teams up with Michelle Yeoh, as a Chinese secret agent, and provides an equal match for our hero. I would have loved to have seen more with that team. Jonathan Pryce is also entertaining as the main villain. His secret power is the ability to type with one hand. That's one ability I'd like to have!"
3,Brosnan Excels as Hard-Edged 007,"A flat pre-credit sequence and by-the-numbers climax prevent ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" (1997) from matching the overall excellence of ""GoldenEye."" What remains is mostly splendid - with Pierce Brosnan as an elegant yet refreshingly hard-edged James Bond. Jonathan Pryce's multimedia villainy and Michelle Yeoh's energetic presence help tremendously. However, the 007 producers made a big mistake replacing k.d. lang's dynamic theme song with Sheryl Crow's weak ""official"" version in the opening credits."
2,Lame Villian,"A super villian want to start a war between China and Great Britain, and the reason why is because he wants a media foothold in China? This is the worst plot for a Bond Film hands down. Trying to give Bond an equal female partner is getting old. Doesen't anyone remember Anya Amasova from The Spy who Loved Me. The only good part about this film is Pierce Brosnan. However he can't save this mess."
2,Not like the classics,"Lot of action in this one with very little thought going into the storyline. Not near as good as the earlier ones, this one falls flat on its face, gets a big thumbs down."
2,"Ok movie, i guess?","Ok, i like Bond movies but this one stinks I fell asleep about an 45 minutes through. Has its moments but it isn't worth buying. Spend your money on real action, like, I don't Know, TERMINATOR!!!!!"
2,I Hope Tomorrow Really Isn't This Bad.,"Holy Moly this is a bad movie. The plot was not very interesting or even feasible. The Bond girls were horrible. If only Terry Hatcher's chest was as big as her ego, this matched might have worked. What was up with Michelle Yeoh? She's got to be the most unsexy bond girl ever. I take that back, Grace Jones (A VIEW TO A KILL), was the worst. I was hoping that TND would live up to GOLDENEYE, but I was sadly disappointed. Good Lord! Did they give him enough campy one liners? In the Bond films, you always accept a few, but this was ridiculous. The bright spots in the movie, and oh were there very few, were the decent at best car chase scene and the motorcycle scene. I hope for the Bond movies sake, that newcomers do not view this one first."
2,This makes Moonraker look like a classic,"Save your money. Tomorrow Never Dies ranks up their with A View To A Kill. First, someone please get Brosnan out of this role. He looks the part, but he has no personality. Bring Connery out of retirement and give Bond a pulse again. Plot goes as follows, Media Mogul Jonathan Pryce ( wasting his time ) wants to start a war in the William Randolph Hearst tradition. blah, blah, blah. Even Moonraker's plot was better than this travesty. Stamper, the evil henchman, is about as effective as Mayday. It was such a surprise when the number 2 Bond girl died, actually, no, no it wasn't. If you are going to copy the formulas of the good Bond films, at least copy a good one like From Russia With Love. Honestly, nobody can call Live and Let Die stupid until you see this entry in the series."
2,What Happened?,I would have to say this is the worst Bond Movie there is. This is not the James Bond Ian Fleming introduced some years ago. The Movie is to dark and sinster. They need to go back to the James Bond Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton portrayed. Once again I will ask the question- What Happend!?
2,A dissapointment!,"I thought that they were just trying to grab some money after GoldenEye. GoldenEye was far better. The thing that really takes the movie down is that the plot with the""bad-guy"" really needs work. I recommend that they use terrorists in their next movie, not people that own something kinda like CNN or other networks for news!"
3,Same old same old,"I only saw the film when I heard Michelle Yeoh was gonna be in it. It's about time these Bond girls are not portrayed as bimbos or passive objects. I really loved it when Michelle was choked from behind, hurled against the wall, but she did this amazing back flip climb and kicked the bad guy's butt from behind!"
4,I believe this is a great movie!,"This movie is great but I believe it lacks one major potential to be one of the best Bond films. It doesn't have a good story line. It's about a mad media titan that is trying to take over the world with his media network. It is unrealistic, I think. Who would try to do this. With his power he could of found another way to take over the world. I just wanted to bring this up. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie but I believe a better story line could have been created. That is why I gave Tomorrow Never Dies a 4 star rating. I am only eleven but I thought this was a good point."
2,Great action but empty,"This film takes 007 and turns him into just another action hero after one of those shady billionaire villains. The lagging plot is saved by some incredible stunt work, but the characters have been ""updated"" so badly are hardly recognizable. Joe Don Baker is terrible in his two scenes playing the obnoxious American the British love to hate, and Dench's coquettish smiles at Bond's behavior border on silly. Bring back Connery and Moore...heck, even Lazenby and Dalton!"
3,Dumb One,"Great sound track and stunt work/effects, but gimme a break! Can the villians get any sillier? Perhaps having seen this right after watching the classic Cleopatra, (Liz Taylor, Rich Burton) affected my judgement, but try it... watch this and then watch something with substance and you will take latter every time."
3,Missing Cubby,"As a Bond devotee who skipped out on the last few releases in the theaters, this was a real disappointment. Brosnan showed he has the stuff in Goldeneye, but Broccoli's direction is *sorely* missed in this DieHard/Seagall-ish shoot-em-up. Not too many years ago Roger Moore was even concerned about kicking the villain's car over a cliff. Now Bond spews bullets like Rambo.... The plot is clever, very much up to standards, but the new direction/production staff needs to find its *direction* to make Bond work in the 21st. We're all pulling for 'em!"
