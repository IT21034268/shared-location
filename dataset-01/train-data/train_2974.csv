2,Fantastic until it quit working,"I bought this ice shaver only 1-2 months ago, and one day it simply stopped working. Until then it was fantastic and I loved the ease with which it turned out shaved ice and the quality and texture of the ice. Now it still moves, still turns, but simply will not produce any shaved ice. I removed and sharpened the blade but to no avail. If it already needs a new blade, it should come packaged with several rather than having to order them."
1,Not happy on Syracuse,"Not the greatest product. I have the less expensive model by the same company and it works much better. I can see how a parent would prefer this product if it was to be used by children as the less expensive model, although electric, requires strength. But for my use, the less expensive model is the way to go. It is MUCH faster. This product is slow and does not produce shaved ice with any degree of consistancy. Some days, no matter what I did, it would not produce shaved ice. Go with the less expensive electric model. This model needs to be re-engineered!!"
4,Simple to Use and easy to clean up.,"Neat product and does the job.Kids are happy and I am happy.I wish it had come with an extra bladejust in case I need it.Used it five times since I had it.Red Bean and Ice, yum yum!Will be use more often for partynow. Love it!"
3,Might have been better,"This is a case of ""lower your expectations"". Compared to other products of this nature, this is an excellent product. I felt the item description was untrue to its nature since it does not appear to be made from real leather - more like a plastic that is trying to look like leather. The construction is good and, from afar, it looks decent. I remain undecided as to whether the jewelry will make the case look expensive - or whether the case will make the jewelry look cheap..."
1,Awful packaging,"Mine arrived falling out of an open box, dented in numerous places, and missing pieces. Shameful. I will be sending it back as soon as I figure out how to package it up -- the box is barely holding together with excessive tape!The light itself didn't look bad (aside from the damage), but the silver powder coat finish is rather dull, and I suspect a white lining would reflect much more light and offer a more efficient system."
1,Junk,Had some shipping damage but got it working and now it has crapped out after about three months. Total junk.
1,Sloppy shipping of a mediocre product.,"This item may have looked nice (like the picture) at some point, but when it got to me it was dinged and dented so bad I'm ashamed to hang it in my garage. It still sits in the box it came in with NO protective packing. It was probably a return from someone who promptly sent it back - like I should have. Save yourself the aggrevation of buying from this vendor thru Amazon."
1,every single 1 was damaged in shipping,i ordered 10 every single 1 had damadge and 1 was so bad it wouldnt workpoor poor poor job packing they used the same boxes that they come in at lowes not made for shippinggo to lowes pay the extra couple of bucks you wont have damadged lightsthis will definetly efect me buying on amazon now
1,NOT BAD BUT ALL DAMMAGED WHEN SHIPED,YOU GET WHAT YOU SEE I ORERD 3 THEY CAME IN 3 BOXES ALL DAMAGED COST TO MUCH TO RETURN BUT STILL WORK JUST ALL DENTED UP
4,Menopause Symptoms are Gone,Using the Zalestra menopause product for 4 weeks and my symptoms have all but subsided. That is great but I have only lost 6 pounds at this point in time. I need to lose another 45 pounds as per my doctors directives. It's difficult for me to lose because I like to snack on food after midnight because I work late and my schedule is really not condusive to good eating habits.
1,This product did nothing,I am very disappointed in this product. It was costly and did not perform one of the items it claimed.
1,Disappointed,"I bought 2 bottles and took it religiously. I didn't lose one pound and could tell little difference in menopausal symptoms; flashes, sleep disturbance, energy level,etc. This product is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, so I got smart and read the ingrediants. I then bought the herbs at a fraction of the cost. I couldn't find every last one, but the 4 or 5 main ingrediants were available, some at Walmart. I'm now taking a higher dosage of each herb and if it doesn't work after a few more months I'm not out a truck-load of money. Get smart and buy the herbs yourself!"
4,Zalestra review,"This product helped with all the changes I went through during this difficult adjustment period. All the moodiness, aches, and severe migranes are gone. I recommend this to all women, we all need Zalestra when the time comes."
3,Just started taking this product,Just started taking this. So far so good I heard alot of good things about this product from my friends.
2,zalestra,helped at the beginning with hot flashesdid nothing for weight or energynow it doesnt work on the hot flasheseither.i would't buy again
1,Not As Good As Other Products.,"As far as relief of Symptoms, Zelestra is far less effective then other cheaper products (90 Capsules is only a 22 Day Supply). It seems to be completely ineffective for weight loss. A real dissapointment."
4,Menopause is no walk in the park,"I'd heard of this product knowing that menopause has a nasty way of sneaking up on you, I bought it as soon as I started feeling the symptoms.Glad I had it on hand and I am fully stocked. I worked way too hard to be fit and thin after having 3 children (who are now in college) There was no way I was going to let the transition to my golden years be foiled by menopause. Especially if I already had anxiety and depression issues.Great Product."
4,Thanks to the makers of Zalestra....,"Hats off to the makers behind this product. I am extremely careful about what I take. I thought I could get through ""the change of life"" without having to take anything to help my changing body cope with menopauseal symptoms especially weight gain. I struggle with weight gain as it is and when I hit menopause oh boy did I immediately feel the pounds sticking even more. As for my own personal menopause experience I first was always fatigued and very emotional really heavy mood swings thus taking away any motivation to exercise like I did before which was about 3x's a week. Now I'm back on track with my treadmill and not so blue of a mood. I really believe this product is helping me get through this period in my life without driving myself and my friends and family crazy. I love them and thank them for thier support :)"
3,I am feeling relief with this product,I just placed my 2nd order for this product. It provided relief from my discomforts.
4,Very happy I found this product.,This is an extremely effective supplement. Since taking it I have had more energy and less moodiness. I recommend it to everyone I know going through menopause.
3,Zalestra review,"This product has helped with making me more calm, no more emotional mood swings since taking it. I'd say it's a good product."
2,Did nothing for me.........,"I like a product if it works, but I did not see any change in my weight at all. Did nothing form me."
3,Just not for me I guess!,"I've been searching for awhile now for a replacement for a supplement called Rejuvex, which I loved. It was one pill a day and it was just wonderful for all the usual menopausal problems like hot flashes. It was discontinued (don't know why) and it was perfect for me. I thought I'd try this one because of the reviews, etc. and it's ""natural"" but I really don't like having to take something twice a day. You're supposed to take 2 capsules in the morning and mid-afternoon. My work day is so busy (at a school) that mid-afternoon comes and goes without me being able to stop and take a couple of pills! I was missing my dose more often than not. Therefore, I'm really not reviewing if it works or not if taken as directed. If you have no problem with the dosage, etc. it may work fine for you..........it's just not for me!"
1,No weight loss,"I do not recommend this product, the weight loss promise is not real.It is a very expensive product. I strongly recommend Macafen."
4,Very Pleaseed,I have been using this product for almost 1 month and I must say that I feel great. The night sweats are almost gone and I have tons of energy.I would recommend others to try this product.
1,Hasn't worked for me,"I purchased this product to gain relief from hot flashes and night sweats. I don't know how long it takes to work, but it's been 2 weeks and the flashes and sweats are just as bad as they were before. Plus, you have to take 4 pills a day, which means it costs over $55 for 22 days. That's ridiculously expensive. I'll try Estroven which my gynecologist recommended. It's much more reasonably priced. At least if that doesn't work, I won't feel as if I was taken."
3,Diminished menopausal symptoms but no weight loss,"I tried many supplemnts to help with symptoms of menopause; hot flashes, mood swings, and weight gain. Zalestra reduced the frequency of hot flashes. I do notice a decrease in appetite but no weight loss (and I do exercise. I am on my second bottle so I would recommend it for hot flashes and irritability, but I don't see where it will work as a wt loss supplement. :("
2,Evreryone talks about PMS and Menopausal Symptoms.......what about weight loss?,"Can someone please talk about their experience on loosing weight with this dietary supplement? There are several reviews here that are duplicated with different names, please if you can be original then don't even try to copy what others say.It only confuses the readers who a looking for helpful information. We the consumer trust your reviews.Thanks"
1,This product does not work,I have severe menopausal symptoms and this product did nothing for me. I have the same amount of hot flashes that I had before.
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I have been taking Zalestra for 24 days (two in the morning and two in mid-afternoon as instructed on the container) with absolutely no relief from the hot flashes and no weight loss either. I was so sure this was going to work, but it looks like I'll have to resume taking prescription estrogen which I had stopped taking 6 months ago after 9 years.Barbara C.(New York)"
5,This helped me with my menopausal symptoms,I am very pleased with this menopause product. I feel more calm and not so moody...my husband would like to give a big thanks to the makers of Zalestra!
4,Zalestra review 4 stars,"I am very thankful for Amazon having Zalestra, I would have never found it on my own. I shop Amazon all the time because it is a very trustful site.Zalestra has helped me incredibly in dealing with menopause."
4,Very good supplement for menopause,"Zalestra has made menopause bearable.Thankfully I haven't had any weight gain problems however my moodiness was driving everyone crazy, especially me. One minute I was joyful and the next severely emotional and depressed. I thought I was losing my mind."
4,Zalestra made my menopause bearable,I tried just about every over-the-counter menopausal product and Zalestra works the best. I have been more calm since taking and I just ordered my 2nd Zalestra order.
1,Severe rash,"After taking Zalestra for 2 days I broke out in a severe rash mainly over the torso area. The rash continued to last for a couple of weeks after I stopped taking it. While I can't be certain Zalestra caused it, I could not attribute it to anything else and I have no allergies to foods."
4,Zalestra review- I rate it higher that most other menopause products...,"This stuff is great. I have been able to deal with the discomfort of my ""Change of Life"".Zalestra was recommended to me by my gynocologiest."
1,Disappointed,"I was really hoping this supplement would kick start my metabolism, which has become so sluggish after menopause. Unfortunately, I do not feel different than before and I continue to struggle with my weight."
3,Symptoms have been better,Big difference in my Menopausal symptoms but still waiting for the weight to come off. I somehow managed to quit smoking in the midst of all this physical chaos however it's made me eat like a horse. I'm trying to eat healthy.
3,Just started taking this product,I heard alot of great things about Zalestra. I decided to try this based on all the positive things my friends in my bridge club have said about it.
4,A fine addition. . .,". . .to the Ancient Christian Commentary series.I have commented on other volumes in this series, and have not been uncritical when I felt that criticism was necessary. With ""Genesis 1-11"", the editors made a positive effort to provide ""Ancient Christian"" thought on this most difficult portion of Scripture. In addition, the decision by the General Editor(s) to divide Genesis into two volumes, using chapters 11 and 12 as the dividing points made a great deal of sense.All in all, recommended."
5,Outstanding little talked about timeless classic,"Outstanding survey of technical analysis. Core principles are as applicable today as when originally written. Book brought back by Lambert-Gann publishing of Pomeroy, WA."
5,"Practical Advice: Straight Up, With a Twist","I loved this book. It's more fun to read than many of the relationship or help books because it's a lot less formal, and the advice is very practical. For instance, Dr. Paul gives some pointers about how to behave in the professional world and he also has some interesting political observations. Since most women tend to be moderate-to-liberal in their views, they'll find themselves agreeing with Dr. Paul. My favorite part of the book is in Part IV: For Women Only, which leads into my second favorite chapter: Sex! Seriously, I like how Dr. Paul serves his advice - straight up, with a twist."
5,No Problems,"My wife and I have played the original so this seemed the next logical step. Updated graphic drivers,installed the game and d/l the latest patch. NWN2 runs great on both of our computers(AMD4400 dual core 7800gtx in SLI & AMD XP3000 6800xt). I have read negitive reviews from others about crashes, bugs, etc but have not had any problems. Looks great with easy to use interface that is improvement from original. I am learning the toolset via on-line tutorials and hope to create my own module to play soon. Steep learning curve for toolset but not any harder than the original."
5,"Outstanding, its a step up from the original!","Either NWN or NWN2 I still rate both of them 5 stars. This game has more content than the original release of neverwinter nights. For now you can only reach level 20. But that was the same with the first game, until shadows and hordes expansions were released. This game definetely has more potential than the first game which is why I gave it a overall of 5 stars."
1,DON'T BUY! NO CD-KEY INCLUDED IN PACKAGE,"So I got this as a Christmas gift, and as I start to install it I look and there is no CD key, ANYWHERE! BURNED!SO I can't even PLAY this game to tell you what it's like, unlessI buy a second game and -hopefully-maybe-possibly- find one in there.Which I will tell you honestly isn't going to happen.I've own a few Atari games, and the quality of theirproducts are on a hardcore downhill ride. I have another Atari game (Demon Stone) and in that one the SOUND doesn't even play. I won't be buying from this company ever again."
2,Requires a huge system to run,"I recently purchased this machine to play on my 5 month old Dell Dimension E510 with 1GB of RAM, dual-core processor, and 256MB video card. Nevertheless, the game is choppy and doesn't run well.This is probably due to poor programming, and one should realize that these problems were in another game (Temple of Elemental Evil) by the same company.To run this game correctly, you are going to need a high-end, possible server-class machine with a 768MB video card ($700), dual-processor (add $500), and at least 1.5GB of RAM (add another $200-300). So if you are willing to throw $1400 in upgrades into your machine, or purchase a new machine for $4000-5000 you are good to go.The game is massive and took hours to install. Downloading the 80MB patch from the Internet took an hour in itself.So word of warning. The game will not run on 98% of computers out there. Don't waste money thinking you can run it -you can't."
1,"How Odd, It still isn't shipped?","I have pre-ordered this game in May 2006, as soon as I realized I could. And yet, even though the game is out, and people around me have recieved it and played it, the package is not shipped. I'd hope that Amazon would have prioritized the shipping for those who ordered first over those who ordered last, as they have obviously waited longer, but I was wrong. The most annoying thing is that the estimated shipping date is ""August 9 - August 18, 2006"". I think the estimate is a bit off. It is frustrating, and I only hope the game is worth it.I merely give a low raiting because I have yet to actually see the game on my screen."
3,A fun game if your system can handle it,"This game has fairly steep system requirements, but if your system can handle it, the game is a lot of fun. I am enjoying the story a lot, and there seem to be a lot more dialogue options in this game than in NWN I.On the downside, you spend A LOT of time controlling the camera, especially on indoor dungeons. So many games have gotten camera control right, it's a shame this one didn't.The biggest plus over NWN I is that you can finally have a full party again. That's what made games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale so much fun, and that fun is now back again. If your system meets the requirements for this game, you'll have a lot of fun. If not, you can still find Baldur's Gate, one of the BEST D&D; games ever made, for under $10."
2,The Longest 4 Year Disappointment,"Neverwinter Nights: One of the most highly acclaimed RPG titles finally has a sequel!After literally 10 minuts of gameplay, I couldn't be more disappointed.Pros-Graphics are noticeably nicer. Crisp, Clean refresh rate...and that is about it.Cons-The interface is completely and totally abysmal. I have no other way of putting this.The screen at 1024 X 728 resolution is cluttered and unmanageable.Your player movement is sloppy and uninspired. I tried to use the default movement keys (WASD) thinking it would make movement/camera angle easier to navigate. Nope. Still terrible.These are my impressions after 10 minutes.How on earth did you manage to make this game so unplayable? What a complete and utter disappointment. Did your developers or playtesters even play this? Are you sure you didn't accidentally give them a copy of NWN 1?Do not buy this; you will be sorely disappointed and out $60. Seriously, save your money for Christmas presents for your family."
5,Enjoyable game,"Having played Neverwinter Nights, I have been impatiently waiting for this sequel. The game is quite enjoyable and immersive. This is no fast-paced superficial hack and slash but a deeper role-playing experience. The editor will make the replay value of this game phenomenal."
2,Looks like something a Pentium III would run,"Not much to cover here than what everyone else said...I got a good deal on it over the weekend being that the store I went to was going out of business...6 disks, 1.5 hrs of patching, 2 reboots and tweaking the graphics card later...the game plays like these guys are in molasses...sadly enough I got a 512 nvidia card on my board but the game looks like something from a P III from years ago. I am just hitting the opening chapters of the game and I am frustrated with the camera-work and combat...not really feeling this game at all. If you a hardcore player of this game, by all means...if not...just avoid"
4,Great Game. Not too much different than the first,"The game seems identical to the first Neverwinter Nights, just a different Story line. Not that it is a bad thing, but the graphics seem to be about the same (I expected major improvement). Over all this is a good game to buy, and keeps you entertained for days."
2,Wait for titanium edition...,"CONS:- Riddled with game-stopping bugs, and technical support never got back to me. No help from the self-help forum either.- Jumpy frames due to point source lighting in a game where the graphics aren't good enough for you to notice good lighting effects.- Gameplay camera is not easily maneuverable or controllable.- Update requires a ridiculous 6 GB of free hard-drive space, which is about as much as the original game install.PROS:- Very cool D&D; style combat and character builds.- Entertaining, and sometimes original, storyline.- Nice repertoire of skills/abilities.They rushed this to get it out before Christmas '06, and basically, it's still a prototype.Wait until they get the bugs out!"
2,NWN 1.5,"Yes, the graphics are prettier than NWN, but the game often oddly jumps like a slide show missing some slides. It's very useful to control your minion's inventories, but changing your party is a big pain, because you have to change around your party multiple times in one go in order to switch around inventory items, because there's no universal inventory. If you really loved NWN, this isn't a bad game to buy, but I'm sure there are better ways to spend your money."
2,High-End Only,"Due to my love of both bioware and obsidian games I was greatly anticipating this game and bought a new computer to play it (although I will admit a relatively low end new system). The system specs were well above the recomendeded and despite this the game runs incredably poorly. Were not talking a little bit, were talking jumping animations, poor movement, and graphics far below NWN1 to make it playable. I don't know exactly how they managed to pull this off, but its impressive. If you have a top end gaming system I suspect this game would be rather amazing, but with anything beneath that it is sadly a waste of cash."
1,One of the worst UIs ever,"Give me back ""gold-box"" NWN on AOL! Constantly having to adjust the camera angles (""excuse me Mr. Dwarf can you hold off attacking for 30 seconds while I turn the camera so that I can see you."") eliminated any enjoyment that I could squeeze out of this.Trying to distinguish which character was which gave me a headache. I cannot even imagine trying to plan a battle tactically with this UI. So far it basically seems like a chaotic, thoughtless hack fest. I fear the first dungeon puzzle I come across.At this point, I am hoping the lizard people slaughter my character so I can quit and play planescape, BG 1, BG2 or NWN1. Any of them would be much more fun than this.While I appreciate others opinions, for me the prettiest thing about this game was the box. Everything else was unremarkable."
1,Not for the average gamer,"I consider myself something of a gamer, but this game did not work on my system at all. If you haven't invested $500 within the last year on video cards, RAM and processor speed, don't bother trying to purchase this game. I'm out the $40 for a game that doesn't work, even though I meet the listed computer requirements for the game. If your computer isn't top of the line and the latest, don't bother because you won't get higher than 5 frames per second."
1,So much potential- so little delivery,"The graphics aren't bad, although if you're a fan of actually doing anything in your game, I'd recommend turning most of the graphics options off for performance reasons. Obsidian threw in the obligatory major ""overhaul"" of the user interface (read: ""Change for change sake"") so even if you're a NWN junkie like me, it's good to run through the tutorial. Especially since if you don't, a bug in the game won't let you save.And speaking of not being able to save, devote a lot of time to playing. Every time I quit, my save games and settings disappear.This is what happens when the pros don't work on the sequal to a best seller. NWN wasn't perfect, but Bioware didn't release something this bad."
1,Not Ready for Primetime,"What a disappointment. I have been a major fan of Balders Gate and NWN for years and I was very excited about this game. I have a good rig as well (AMD 3200XP 256MB Video, 1GB of RAM).Yikes - the game was unplayable due to the enormous amount of bugs. The simple act of saving a game crashed the machine. When you complain on the NWN2 blog, the developers have you start hacking into your registry. No thanks.This game is in beta form and I would definately wait 6 months or more before buying. The camera and the inventory system leave much to be desired as well - assuming you can even get the game running. Frankly, to release a game in this state is unexcusable. You've been warned!"
3,Has potential,"Obsidian wrote this game primarily for it's built in single player campaign,however the toolset has possibilities. With patience and practice coupled with continued support from both Obsidian and the player community the toolset could be become truly fantastic. Persistant worlds are starting to appear with tons more on the way. Buy the game, keep up with the patches and you'll love it.There are some stability problems with the game but nothing that driver updates cannot fix. You do however need a strong machine. Pay attention to the recommended requirements."
1,great game but bad,i bought this game a couple of months after it came out but now i cant reinstall it. i usually do a system restore every once in a while but now because of that i cant install the game so i cant play something i paid for. i thought that the game was great to play and very entertaining but now i cant reinstall it and play it.
3,"It's ok, something to do while waiting for better MMORPG's","ProsGraphics are decent if you have a top of the line killer rig.Story is engaging.Combat is about as fun as NWN1 but better with character switching.ConsGraphics must be turned way down (to worse than NWN1 standards) if youdon't have a top of the line killer rig.Crashes and hangs sometimes.Combat is extremly easy or insanly hard, nothing inbetween.Pick it up if you must pass some time..."
4,Great Sequel,"NWN2 is great in terms of what it is. They took the first one and made the graphics better and upgraded the User Interface. If you want to continue your Neverwinter Nights adventuring in an upgraded graphics and game environment, this is for you. If you are looking for a completely different game in the Neverwinter Nights setting, this is not for you. It is still turn based RPG based on D&D rules with the same type of combat. Which is good or bad depending on what you're lookin for ;-)"
4,Simply Awesome!!,"NWN1 brought a lot to the line of Forgotten Realms RPGs, but they really out did themselves this time. NWN2 is amazing! Game play is exactly the same, but with much better graphics, better actors for voices of NPCs and a ton more game play! You really get your money's worth."
2,Way behind the times!,"Read the other reviews to get a good idea of what you will be dealing with. It is definitely buggy...even with updates. I firmly believe a game should be fully functional out of the box. This game requires and will continue to require updates and patches. I have a pre-release copy becauseI was a beta tester. I have played the retail release version for over 3 weeks.Forget this game and go buy Elder Scrolls: Oblivion!!!To be honest, if you want the best of both FPS and RPG environments...skip this game. The graphics are outdated, the concept is outdated and the inventory management system is horrible. Just wait till you have 2 or 3 characters to manage!!!! UTTERLY FRUSTRATING and TIME CONSUMING!!If you like clicking around with your mouse all day....you could just cruise websites...it won't cost you a dime...or you could play this game!Pass it over, especially if you played the first NWN game. Not much new folks.Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is still the GOLD STANDARD!"
1,"Sad, buggy sequel- Developers should feel shamed","Please do not waste your money, like I did. The game is VERY buggy, and has tons of broken elements. It was clearly done on a low budget, and is just leveraging the great success of the first version.The graphics look like they are from the mid-90's, and the gameplay is just... a joke. So sad- I wish I could get a refund. Especially, because my game broke only part way though. (my brothers snagged on a bug even earlier). I feel robbed and cheated... and mostly just dissapointed."
3,Neverwinter Nights 2,"I've been unable to play under Windows 7!! I wasted my money on this game. However, I'm looking for ways to be able to play."
3,"Now, in 2010, a worthwhile playthrough","That said, I'm giving the game a low rating because AT RELASE, it was buggy and unplayable.This is somewhat par for the course for Obsidian: Great concept, pretty game, good plot...intolerable bugs until well past release (New Vegas would be your more recent case study.) Whether you want to bag that on the Studio or the Publisher is a matter of philosophy I guess.My only gameplay complaints are related to the party characters, they're very transparent and the party-balancing via dialogue isn't detailed enough to actually let you keep everyone content, some combinations just don't work out."
2,disappointed again...I was expecting more the second time around.,"Well I played NeverWinterNights 1 a few months after it came out but with all the bugs and glitches I didn't play it very long. (it was just so damn frustrating) well...time goes on and with the great experience I had with the Temple of Elemental evil I figured this version of NWN would be just as good at TOE. Guess not. Lots of bugs, lots of issues with the AI, the inventory, the spells and abilities turning themselves off at random,...etc. And yes I'm patched and up to date. Obviously some people are loving it. Lots of mods and modules out there. But it's soooo damn FRUSTRATING!! Not sure who to avoid next time...Atari or Obsidian. No way am I buying either of the expansions for this one."
2,Doesn't work on newer processors,"This game is really slow on my AMD system. I have an ASUS m2n board running a dual core Brisbane at 2.2 ghz on XP 32 bit, 2 gig of Ram and an onboard nvidia 6150 graphics card. At first I thought it was the onboard graphics until I loaded up Jade Empire, Fully cranked, and played that with nary a hitch. I updated all my drivers, and the game still ran slow.I am not really sure what is going on here. It's a shame, because this is a favorite game of mine :("
1,"SecuROM used, so the game doesn't work for me.","Unfortunately a fact of life for PC games is that they almost always use sophisticated and tempermental copy protection schemes, which sometimes work with out a hitch and other times render the game unplayable or uninstallable. In my case the game constantly generates CRC error reading from the DVD. Since the errors are on random files and no other (currently running) games seem to have a problem with my DVD drive I can only conclude that the copy protection scheme (SecuROM) is responsible. Especially since Atari's support forums show that a large number of people are have the same or similar issues with running the game.Oh well, maybe punishing ratings and plummiting sales will teach the distributors that it just isn't worth the loss of honest customers in the future."
3,Make Sure Your Computer is Up to Par,"I was quite a fan of the baldur's gate series and was quite pleased when I saw a lot of the storytelling and control sceme from that series make it's way NW2.Gameplaywise, pretty good. Controls...eh...camera...bleh..but not bad enough that you can get used to it.This game is a total resource hog, I have an aging gaming rig, however this game is not doing anything that should require so much bandwidth....They were really lazy with the optimization in my mind....Overall if your into these kinds of games, have play the BG's and NW1, your going to like this one too...."
1,Be warned - NWN2 unplayable on most computers,"Not everyone walks around with the complete system specs for their machine in their head. Looking at the requirements on the box I assumed that since I have plenty of memory and that my comp is still fairly new I'd be up and playing in no time. But it turned out that my video card wasn't an NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or 6800. The game wouldn't run at all with my inferior card.Now that I'm retro-researching, I'm finding out MANY buyers can't access this game without significant upgrades or flat-out buying a new computer. PLEASE don't make the same mistake I did. Make absolutely certain your machine has what it takes to play the game before putting your money down. Otherwise you may end up feeling cheated."
2,No fun whatsoever,"Linear and cliched plot, lifeless NPCs, horrible AI and a clunky interface -- this game has it all. I gave it a good eight hours of play hoping things would pick up, but no dice.The toolset for creating your own modules looks promising (although it is, as of this date, riddled with bugs and missing features). Maybe eventually somebody will use that toolset to create a game that's actually worth playing. For now, though, I can't stress enough that this game is a waste of time and money."
2,Dissapointed,"Mega-disappointment, especially since this game was WAY behind schedule. Originally it was scheduled for release about a year ago - what have they been doing in the extra year they added to development? And why, for the love of God, can't they get something as simple as WASD/Camera follow controls right??? Come on people, this kind of control has been around for many, many years - why can't you get it right?The game runs fine on my machine, but the interface/contols are too big of an obstacle to game play. The character customization (graphics) is basically non-existant, the voice acting/scripts are dreadful, the graphics are wanting, and on and on... To be honest, NWN1 was a far better effort.I'll be going back to Nightfall - see you in Elona"
4,4.5 stars,"This was a fabulous game. I waited to play it until a significant number of the patches were out and I think that's why my experience with the game was considerably better than others.I really enjoyed the storyline in this game. I thought it was engaging, deep, very well developed and told. I enjoyed watching my character go from barely taking on Lizardmen to fighting Dragons. I also felt like my involvement in the greater world at large was much better done than previous games. The NPC characters were considerably more interesting and I enjoyed having them in my party. I also liked that we could control 3 NPC's and for awhile even 4. Made it feel like a true adventuring party vs. NWN1.Overall a great game that I would highly recommend to RPG fans."
4,Great game... if you have the PC power,"The game is great as long as you have the necessary RAM and processor speed. Its a bit different from the 1st (all-time great game), and will take some getting used to, but as a DnD player, it's a great blend from the 3.5 rules and the PC version. The replay value is high and a ton of classes to choose from. I also like the amount of customization that goes into character creation, allowing you to create really unique characters. Would have been nice if they would have more voice sets than jusy using the 1st game's, but no worries. It had room to improve, but you really can't beat the 1st NWN."
3,Dissappointing,I loved the original series and hoped for a lot with this one. I confess I have not played it a lot but this is mostly because the interface and game play is so clunky. The combat interface seems nearly worthless and the camera is difficult and cumbersome. Friends tell me there is a great story line but I have not played enough to know for myself. I have some trouble forcing myself to go back and give it another chance. Perhaps with a patch or two it might be playable and more enjoyable and I could get to see the story line. I suggest this game be purchased from the bargain barrel.
1,Read the specs before you buy...,My husband and I couldn't wait for this game to be released and Amazon had the greatest prices for it. We snatched up two copies and the guide and couldn't wait for the delivery which is always prompt from this site. Here's the catch..no specs listed on the site for the game..we are unable to play because our comps do not meet the minimum requirement for this game. This game requires window XP..pentium 4 2.4 gig or AMD athlon xp 2000 or higher..512 mb ram ..higher preferred...nvidia 6600 is minimum or ati with pixel shader 2 is minimum.So beware before you buy..read the boxWe were able to play for two minutes..our video cards are nvidia but not the 6600 or better series...you move two frames every 2 minutes without it.Good Luck
1,Falls way short of the original (See expanded review),"This is more like Icewind Dale than NWN.If there was a demo I wouldn't have bought it.If you like NWN you probably won't like NWN2. They removed many useful things NWN had, made it so large pw's won't be possible, there's hardly any monsters.A horrible let down"
4,Waited for patches--Runs very well,"Instead of buying games when they first come out, my gaming group and I wait (sometimes several years) to buy new games to play together. With NWW2, this strategy seems to have paid off well for us. After patching (an hour investment at least), we have played this game co-op over a LAN with little problems. The one time we did struggle to play was due to a conflicting setting that was easy to diagnose and change.Graphics are beautiful. My computer was built in the winter of 2006, and I play on maxed out settings. I recently went back and played NWN1. The older game is difficult to play now because I am used to being able to adjust my camera in NWN2. If you don't like monkeying with camera angles, then this game probably isn't for you. But if you like a good story, great characters, and interesting dungeon crawls, I highly recommend NWN2."
2,I really want this game to work,"I have got back into D&D; recently after many years, mainly through playing DDO Stormreach, which I would really recommend. On the strength of this I bought NWN2. The character generation is good and in line with 3.5 rules. It gives more options than DDO Stormreach. However once you get into the gameplay it lags like hell, to the extent that it's really unplayable even on a machine that outperforms the requirements as stated on the box. Maybe they should post the PC requirements for a machine that will run it at an acceptable rate, that might have been a better strategy than disappointing customers who THOUGHT their machine would run it ok.Though I can understand they wanted the game to appeal to the widest audience possible.That being said the initial fair has a great RPG atmosphere - its such a disappointment I'm going to have to spend $$$$ to make my machine run it properly"
4,Comments from the author,"Having spent nearly three years researching this book, it is the most detailed look at the career of Michael Powell and his work with Emeric Pressburger. As Steve Crook correctly points out, a number of spelling errors made it into the final manuscript, but this book serves to introduce fans of The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus, Peeping Tom, and I Know Where I'm Going to their other work. In addition to the most comprehensive filmography and bibliography available, it takes a detailed look at most of his films that are available. Thanks to the cooperation of the British Film Institute, many of his lesser-known works were analyzed in detail, including some that were thought to be long lost."
4,Just what we wanted.,The box arrived on time and in good condition. The assembly was fairly easy--my husband put it together in about 1/2 hour. It is just the right size and what we wanted for a studio easel.
2,"slow, pretentious, boring and what's the purpose of this movie?","so the proposition was to kill your brother to save another brother? what's the logic here? since the australian movie makers tried to imitate hollywood's western movies, every one come out of there was weird, and this one is no particular to the others, they never got over with the 'mad max' formula, crazy, bloody, gross, filthy, pointless and pretentious. this proposition sucks big time! 'two thombs up""? give me a break."
2,Sonically lacking,"The reviews and price for the Fishman Pro-EQ were good so I decided to purchase one based on that information. I needed something to travel (fly with) to gigs that are not driveable and was looking for something that was small enough yet had a quality sound for my acoustic guitar. I use an old 1990 Trace Acoustic Amp for my usual preamp needs and love it as it always sounds great when the direct outs on the back run to a PA-front of house system. It weighs 40+ pounds and is impossible for ""flying"" needs. I tried the Fishman after receiving it and was very unsatisfied in comparison to the old Trace Eliot. It sounded artificial and dull and although the build quality seems to be there and the size and weight were good for my needs, it would never do sonically.I guess that's what I should have expected for $135.00I returned it subsequently and was given a refund."
3,acceptable,cheap plastic casing and inks will dry easily because of the opening at the tip but a hassle free all in one go purchase if you need a large number of colors
2,Handy But Dries Out Quickly,"I really love the idea of retractable highlighters. Who wouldn't love the idea of not having to cap and re-cap your highlighters over and over again?Unfortunately, these highlighters have the life-span of about three days. If you're in a profession or graduate program that requires a lot of consistent highlighting, I wouldn't recommend these highlighters unless you have money to burn. Even an aggressive highlighting session of more than an hour can kill it quickly.So for now, it's back to the regular highlighters for me!P.S. The blue highlighter ink is a bit dark."
3,Nice if you like muted colors,"I did the run-around at the office supply trying out the retractable highlighter. I first bought the other brand, and returned it because the ""florescent"" inks were not bright and florescent at all (unlike the pen housing colors).Hoping I would do better with the Sharpies, they had the same problem.I imagine there must be people who prefer that muted, understated highlighter look. Unfortunately I am not one of them.I will buy these when they make them with the super-bright florescent inks, not before then. But I am glad to see the product designers innovating!"
3,Expected more from a Sharpie product,"Sharpie for me is synonymous with quality. These highlighters however let me down. I like that they're retractable, which is one of the main reasons that I chose them, however the other reason was that they won't smear the writing being highlighted. Truth is, they do smear. That's why I'm disappointed. Other than that, they're okay, but I won't be recommending them to anyone."
1,Tea Kettle,Cheap metal that made my tea taste like lead. I'm sorry I paid allot for it. But I found it great for other projects.
5,Blue Teapot,"This is a great teapot. The handle is deceiving. It never gets hot! Holds plenty of water. The outside, stays clean looking. Vinegar boiled inside cleans out the calcium build up I get. Looks great sitting on the range. Adds the blue I want in my kitchen. And heck can take it camping!"
1,Very disappointed,"Received the Mackie order in a timely fashion only to discover the 1.7 oz cologne bottle was cracked and all the liquid had soaked into the box. It was wrapped securely in styrofoam peanuts so no problem there. It seemed to be the way it was attached to the Mackie box. The box smelled nice but no cologne for my 82 yr.-old Mother's Valentine. Very, very disappointed and no replacement from Tuccini."
5,Bob Mackie Lover,"I have always loved Bob Mackie since I was a child. His perfume is one of the best, I have ever smelled or used; I have looked all over for this particular brand of Mackie's Parfume. Thanks to amazon.com I'd don't think I would have found it. I have searched high and low, but still to no avail, I had almost given up my search, but at last, I have found my Bob Mackie. To hold, touch, and smell again. Now I can feel free again in this elegant parfume. Now I'm sweet again.Thanks BM"
3,Bring it out of Retirement!,"I have used the body lotion for years and I found this at Amazon and decided to buy it. The product is old but I thought I would try it. The lotion has lost it's luster and I wish Mackie would consider bringing this back to life. I always get complements when I were this light yummy smelling lotion! Unfortunately, the one I bought is watery and doesn't smell good anymore."
5,DCT is singin just fine!!,"If you like any of Blood, Sweat & Tears and David Clayton Thomas then just buy it. You won't be disappointed. The only problem with the recording was when the alto player did a solo on Lucretia MacEvil, the sound guy didn't turn his mic on or he did not have a bug mic. Apart from that, it's a good concert and the gospel thing at the end is ok too."
3,ralph,jacket as promised but very late delivery...and was made to pay duty of 40...which i did not expect as i had paid for delivery already at purchase of item
3,Different style from the band and it works.,"Amanset is great at this kind of warm drone music but this record is alot more drawn out both songs are over 10 mins and virtually instrumental. The reason that it gets 3 stars is because the other albums are so great although for true fans this is great but not something you would listen to all the time. In a way it reminds me of Miles Davis' ""In A silent Way"" groovin ambient jazz."
5,Rave Review for 'Aspects in Astrology'by Sue Tompkins,"Sue Tomkin's 'Aspects in Astrology' is an indespensable cook-book guide to aspect combinations. It can be used by astrologers of any experience level, and includes useful technical information, on orbs etc. It is written in accessable language, and includes numerous interesting case study examples. Her book is ideal for astrology teachers. There is just one problem: the book is consistently unavailable and/or extremely expensive in Australia. I hope that her publishers read this review and consider reprinting in a less expensive format. It is excellent, and had it been less expensive and more available I would have brought dozens of copies for my students"
5,good,"In depth analysis of the way different planets combine in aspects. Does not narrow down by aspect, but, for example will have 2-3pages on mercury-venus instead of having different, shorter paragraphs for each different type of aspect. I really liked it."
5,British astrologer's very good work,"Now it seems to me that most of astrology books are written by American astrologers. Their books are sometimes very well-written, but they are always too simple in terms of interpretation. Although this book employs ""cook-book"" style, but it contains a lot of valuable inspirations, and practical examples. Her way of writing is very elegant and also eloquent. Even if you are tired of cook- book introductory books in astrology, this book is still worth to read."
5,aspects to astrology,I thought this was a great book on aspects on a persons chart. Highly recommend this book
4,"A look at women's history, from 1974.","This book is a reexamining of the lives of historical English-speaking women, from the vantagepoint of the revolutionary 1970s. Includes biographical commentary about Fanny Wright, the Grimke sisters, Margaret Sanger, Jane Addams, Victoria Woodhull, Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Martineau, and many more. A good women's history resource."
5,"TARGET IS A RED HOT ""BULL'S EYE""","Great book on a great company!!! Target is known for being Fast, Fun, and Friendly. This book is a must for all retailers to know how do to do it right...the first time!!!"
2,Fair,This book was ok. I thought it could have included a lot more detail on how Target actually works. Instead it was a long list of facts that sounded more like an article than a book.I recommned a quick skim of this book.
2,Not much,"My two rating is graded on the curve. Could have been a one. I found myself skimming most of the book. It would probably mostly appeal to Target fans who are women and have an interest in businesss. 4 out of 5 Target customers are women. The book covers a lot about the history of the Daytons and how it grew into Target, but not about the inter-day workings and decisions. The book isn't worth more than a quick evening's read. It's interesting that the people who wrote a piece for the back cover (Stuart Varney and the author's Self supervisor/colleague) have/had a business realtionship to the author. No really notables who were canvassed or who offered their reviews.If you want to read about retail business, there are plenty of other books about Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Starbucks, et al which are much more interesting and a better investment of your leisure time."
2,Not worthy,"I expected much more of this book. Much of the information is about the opinion of the customers, not a real investigation of Target strategies."
2,Informative But Sycophantic,"I read this book upon the advice of an HR staff member at Target interviewing me for a management position. While I found the history of Target informative and interesting, the remainder of the book was simply an extensive marketing packet for the company. There was little to no objectivity, especially when the author bashes Walmart and Kmart as incompetent and bland, boring competitors to Target. Furthermore, the author admits to having close relatives within the executive hierarchy of Target! It seems like a conflict of interest... One other thing that bugged me was that despite this being a paperback edition, there were still grammatical errors on one in every three pages. I'm not exaggerating, it really made me cringe at times. Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone except current Target employees looking to impress their managers."
1,A sorry book,Quite possibly the worst book that I have ever read. It is an infomercial from start to finish. At least one comparison as to how efficiently Target is managed compared to other stores actually proves the opposite of what the clueless author intends (If you look at the numbers). It is pure hype with no real value to anyone who graduated high School.
3,"Decent but ""Where is the on/off switch?""","Solidly constructed, casts a decent beam with the incandescent bulb and two AA batteries but you have to unscrew the lamp cover or take the batteries out to turn it off. I suppose you wouldn't need that if you were cave exploring but I use it in the early morning darkness to do livestock chores. I'd like to have an on/off switch to save the batteries without needing to take them out each time. If it had one, I'd give it a higher rating."
4,Amelodic technical death,"Twisty, complex blend of death metal and jazz fusion. Expertly played, always interesting, sometimes even groovy, but not quite as engaging as their previous album (Under a Stone with No Inscription). I'd hesitate to call this melodic, at least not in any traditional sense - these are strange, dissonant, mutating lines, taking cues from MORBID ANGEL and later-era DEATH. Chuck Schuldiner would be proud. 4/5."
2,Disapointed.,"Expected better. Don't waste your money on this DVD ""Kids are Funny"" is much better and this one I would recommend"
2,"""Best of"" my fanny","A ""best of"" from Jeff Lorber with nothing from Wizard Island and only one from Lift Off (granted, itself a compilation)? What was being smoked when this list was approved? There are some fine songs here of course, but I can't imagine any serious Lorber fan not shaking their heads and rolling their eyes at this one."
2,To Be Frank,"Not trying to beat a dead horse, but I have to agree -- this is a great short but Frankly, it's ridiculously high-priced.If the rights-holders to ""Frank Film"" are reading this, would you please just release a DVD and sell it for a reasonable price (like under $10)?Until you do, don't be surprised if not too many people want to part with $50 for a 9-minute short."
1,Useless - putting mat won't lay flat,"The putting mat seems to be permanently crinkled in a few spots so you can't get the ball to roll toward the cup without jumping the rolls. I tried heavy books to ""iron"" them out to no use. As with most golf gimic items, they don't work well. Save your money."
2,It's a hard read,"Maybe it's just me - but i found this book rather hard to read. And really rather boring. The majority of the book is about who Gilles was before the crimes. And I'm not talking about who he was personally, but who his family was, his title etc. It was just REALLY boring. Great if you are doing a report on him - there is a lot of info. But it just wasn't what i was expecting or looking for. The details of his crimes are very brief.if you are looking to delve into the mind and actions of a serial killer - this just isn't your book."
4,"The Little Rabbits, Yeah (Box Set)","This album is fabulous, and too hard to find offline...beyond atmosphere, beyond funky, you think it's one thing and then it changes your mind! First hear some of these tracks on the web and the fire was lit.Check it out..."
4,Mod Revivalism 101,"In late 70s/early 80s England punk was followed by a revival of the Mod look & sound of the mid 60s. The music was a great combination of punk & power pop. Unfortunately this scene was all but completely ignored in the US. Sure the Jam had a small American following and one neo-mod group did have a Top 30 hit stateside (""turning Japanees"" by the Vapors) but most Yanks never heard the Chords, the Purple Hearts, the Lambrettas, Merton Parkas or Secret Affair. ""On Target"" is an excellent intro to this obscure scene. These bands take what the Kinks, Small Faces & Who started and combined it with the ""revolution"" ... & early Clash. Best songs: ""when you're young"" by the Jam, ""maybe tomorrow"" & ""British way of life"" by the Chords, and ""millions like us"" by the Purple Hearts. Other good neo-mod comps to look for are ""100% British Mod"" and ""This Is Mod"" (US edition)."
5,Just what i was looking for,"I am very pleased with the quality of this product. The baskets are large enough and strong enough to hold a full bag of oranges or apples, I have used the top and smallest one for a melon or a pineapple to let ripen and each fits well. With summer here I am thinking of a getting a second one for easy access to veggies."
3,Chains are weak. Does the job if you baby it.,"I was trying to tweak one of the baskets and one of the links pulled apart, I plied it back together, doesn't look like the rest of the links. Tried the same thing the next week, same thing happened. It is still working like a charm. Truthfully, if you don't let it swing around and just put items in and out of it, works fine. I DON'T recommend piling it full. I would RECOMMEND only filing each basket to the brim, under not over. Not great, but not horrible if you know how to gently handle it."
1,Replace chains and it's great,"I read all of the reviews that said this product broke as soon as they used it, but it was exactly what I was looking for so I bought it anyway. As soon as I got it I didn't even hang it up, I tested it by holding it by the top hook and pushing on the bottom basket, and sure enough, the chains broke in three places!!!I went right out to Lowes and bought $4 worth of chain that was close in color and the same size but was actually QUALITY chain, and the product has been perfect ever since.SO, it's worth buying as long as you don't even bother trusting it, and just replace the chain. The chain is connected to the basket by hooks, so it took me about 10 minutes tops to replace it.I now like it very much and it's a great space saver, gets stuff off of my counter top!"
3,Pretty Flimsy,"This is hanging in our kitchen holding bananas, lemons, and a potatoe - but it won't hold much more. It's pretty flimsy. When we got it, several of the links had fallen off and we had to put it back together. Despite our attempt to count the links on each side, the thing is still a little uneven. It does what we want it to, but if you're looking for anything stronger, don't get this"
1,shoddy workmanship.,"I bought this set of hanging baskets and was surprised when I went to put a bunch of bananas in it. It fell to the gound. The chains had broken in not one, but two places!I used my needle nosed pliers to try and fix it, and for a while it was ok. however, this morning it broke again.Now it's in the trash."
1,Don't waste your money on this kitchen basket,"The chains on this kitchen basket broke in 5 places after only 2 weeks of use. It is very poorly made. Don't waste your money on it. Thankfully no one was underneath it when it broke, but it could potentially be dangerous. I've reported it to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission."
2,Beware of Sudden Crashes!,"I've had this item for about two years, and for a long while I thought it was a great solution to my kitchen storage issues. However, just like one of the other reviewers, one day I must have put one banana too many in the basket, because the chains snapped and everything fell to the counters. I fixed it, like the other reviewer, with pliers, but it happened twice more, and now I am giving up. It's not worth the bruised fruit or toes!"
1,weak chain breaks too easily,"My first review on amazon and it has to be a negative one. I hung the basket up and one of the 3 chains broke as soon as I put in a bunch of bananas in the bottom basket. Thought I could ""fix"" it by squeezing the link closed again with plyers, but it happened again. I saw reviews suggesting the chain is weak and should have listened. I don't recommend this."
1,Uneven,"Design was poor, baskets hang uneven, took apart & tried to straighten it out better, still does not hang right. Threw it away & bought a cheap one that works great."
4,Works Great!,It's more durable than I expected. Works really well in my kitchen. I wish it had come with a hook for the ceiling though because I had to purchase that separately. Oh well I still love it!
5,Great,Ive had it hanging with various items for 6 months now and it's held up perfectly. It still looks new. I can put quite a bit in it and the chains don't appear to be under ny stress.
5,perfect.,"This hanging basket was just what I was looking for. With three tiers, I can separate onions from oranges, and the bottom tier is big enough for a nice bunch of bananas too. Good chrome mesh, and sturdy quality chain. Looks good hanging anywhere."
2,Didn't hold up,My husband and I lived on a sailboat for a year and we thought this would be great for the limited space that we had. Within a week the clip that held the baskets together kept giving out. We finally had to put it together with zip ties to keep it functional. Great idea but very flimsy.
3,Sorta... fell apart,"I was really excited to have something to keep my countertops a little neater. I put it up, and admired it then went out for veggies. When I came back I put a few carrots in the bottom, then as I was starting to place some tomatoes in the next basket, it fell. I was disappointed... After inspecting it, the rings on one of the chains had been loose and just fell out of the other. It was pretty easy to fix with some pliers, but I do expect a little better workmanship that what I (and apparently others) have received. Hopefully it won't happen again, but if it does I'll have my pliers close by."
1,Don't waste your money,This is so poorly made the links are constantly breaking. You definitely get what you pay for with this vegetable basket.
4,Skeptical at first...,"From all the reviews I read I was a bit skeptical, but for the price I said... Why not??I'm so glad I purchased. So far no complaints. It holds oranges and potatoes well.Only reason not a 5, is that it didn't come with an eye-hook to attached to the ceiling for hanging - that would have been helpful, and made the purchase - perfect."
2,Chains Break!,"Attractive and shiny, but not stainless steel, chromed steel as stated (not sure why there aren't stainless steel versions... with stronger chains!). Chains broke after loading similar to picture in the listing. Light duty chains not worth trying to mend after separation. Replacement with box hardware store chain rated at 11 lbs would cost another $6 dollars and time. This product is not worth more than its scrap value in metal."
1,"Junk, Just junk, get a two tier one from gardeners supply company","I bought one of these, like every one else that has one said it's just junk, the chain fell apart several times, I finally had enough so I threw it out at only 2 months old, my search started for a quality replacement NO ONE makes a good three tier basket but I found a awesome super heavy duty one from gardeners supply... [...] I have put well over 15 pounds in these and have had no problems at all! plus the look is a little nicer than these.Cheers,"
1,It broke after only 2 weeks:-(,I was so excited to receive this hanging fruit basket. I wanted my fruit within sight for the family.After less than 2 weeks serving it's purpose the links broke. I wanted it so bad I fixed it with a paper clip only to have more break!!!!!Too cheaply made.
1,I would not trust this chain in battle...,"The baskets themselves are great. However, if you plan to put more than four bananas, two grapefruit, and two onions in this basket, you will be sadly disappointed. Not only will the chain break, but your fruit will fall to the floor/sink/counter and potentially incur bruising. It could make a not-so-good Monday that much worse.Of course, if you have other means of suspending these baskets and wish to devote some time and energy to doing so, this could turn into a great DIY project; I myself have refashioned the baskets with fishing line...and so far, 20 pounds of fruit has stayed suspended for over a week.Best of luck!"
1,Chain Breaks Immediately,"I hung this basket up, filled it with fruit, and 5 minutes later the chain broke and everything came crashing to the ground. All of my brand new organic peaches, vine-ripe tomatoes, and other produce were ruined. I thought it was a problem with just one of the links, so I fixed it with pliers and hung the basket up again, just for the chain to break in two more places before I had even finished filling the basket. Do NOT buy this product, it is garbage. The only good thing is that the company gave me a full refund when I called to complain."
1,Not worth the $$,"I ordered these baskets hoping they would look nicer then the usual wire 3 tier baskets, but unfortunately they do not. They actually not only looked cheap, they were very poorly constructed. Each basket alone was fine, but the chains that they hung from were very flimsy and at each point where the basket is attached to the chain, it was attached with a wire clip making the overall appearance cheap. I returned this item even though they are deducting $5.93 for shipping and the baskets cost me $16 and change, there was nothing I would ever use these for."
1,Lousy chains,"We ordered 2, and BOTH fell apart within minutes of hanging them when we added the second 3lb bag of onions. The decorative chains are terrible. Unfortunately every basket sold on Amazon has similar issues, so we went and spent as much on replacement chains from the hardware store as we spent on the original baskets The baskets themselves are solid."
1,I've had it!,"I have this exact fruit basket but in the copper color and I decided to give it a review today after numerous frustrating experiences with the chain breaking in different places. It looks nice, but it can hardly hold anything without breaking! Before this I had the classic ""fishnet"" hanging basket, and that one broke once, I fixed it and it never happened again. After many years and it getting dusty I replaced it with this one and I hate it! Every time I place a new fruit in it, my heart shrinks in fear that it might break again and often, it does. I don't want to go to the hardware store and get a new chain, I just want a functioning hanging fruit basket!!!PS- I did not buy mine from Amazon, but from a kitchen store. Which I'm sure makes no difference in the quality."
1,PC Not As Advertized,"We ordered Compaq EVO W4000, but received Compaq EVO XW4000 which has a different processor (X=Xeron) and chip set. This one also had rambus and only a CD-Rom rather than the drive advertized. The case physically looks identical, but inside it is completely different. We needed a W4000 to support 24/7 dispatcher operations, parts or as a whole replacement PC. We couldn't use anything off of this one! Buyer beware!"
4,What a Game!!,I love this game. I remember plaing it on the original nintendo and then remember how excited I was when it finally came out for the super nintendo. This game came with a booklet give a brief yet excellent account of japanese history. This game is a must for video game playing history enthusiasts.
3,"Good, but...",You should open it. Use them. They work well. Sad thing -- they're made in China. They won't be worth much in the future as some reviewers seem to think.
5,Awesome Retro Classic! Find this today!,"Great classic shooter... also available on GBA.... find either or...there are a ton of NEW shooters coming out... like Raiden 4, Raiden Fighters Aces, and others on XBLA like TriggerHeart Exelica...get into the genre!!! [...]Great site!"
2,as thin as it gets,"i have used this set only one time and the frying pan bottom got burned and i almost melt the entire pan, and the other two got burned too but not as badly.The copper bottom is thinner than a sheet of cigarette paper and the kit is large enough for only one person, forget about satisfying two people with it,overall two stars."
1,Ben Harper cd,"I would love to review this item for you....however....I still have not received the cd. And yes, It's been well over a month since I ordered it, and PAID for it. Fabulous service guys. I only give one star because apparently you HAVE to give at least one star, but in reality, you get NO stars....ever."
3,Good but not compelling,"This CD single from the UK contains an edited version of City of Blinding Lights from U2's How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb album, as well as two live tracks from a 1992 concert in Manchester, England. The version of City of Blinding Lights is apparently intended for radio airplay and is about 90 seconds shorter than the wonderful album version. This radio edit is fine, but I much prefer the luminous album version.The live tracks, a sinister version of The Fly paired with a pretty good version of Even Better Than The Real Thing, are good but not exceptional. The same can be said of the quality of the recording and mixing. Much better versions of these songs can be found on the Achtung Baby album and, in the case of The Fly, on the Elevation Tour 2001 - Live From Boston DVD.This CD single is therefore a 'must have' only for those who collect everything U2 releases."
5,One of the best songs of all time,"City of Blinding Lights shocks me every time I hear it. The sonic chords created by the edge's guitar are amazing and the lyrics are perfect. I have heard just about every U2 song and I think this is the song that sums it all up. City of Blinding Lights is U2 in a nutshell. Sonic architecture (if that makes any sense) that builds and builds until the blazing conclusion. After this song is over ""WOW"" is all that comes to mind. If you are thinking about buying the single, don't, buy the whole album, it is excellent."
3,not quite what I had hoped,"I read some reviews on this and went ahead and bought it. I was a little dissapointed overall but will continue using it in hopes that my opinion will change. The biggest problem was that the sponges didn't stick at all, I ended up using a dab of superglue to get them to stay in place. Also, my device doesn't alway turn on like it should. I usually use the Biore face scrub which so far, I believe does just as good a job as this creme, maybe even better. Overall, it's not a bad product, especially for the price, but I wasn't blown away with it either."
4,Great machine but-Miss my Starbucks espresso.,"I love the D290. Small, great steam, not much in drip tray unlike some I have had to empty frequently. Love the crema, but I really like starbucks espresso. Wish they had capsules to fit."
1,no coffee for me,This machine is a complete waste of money. I can't get it to give me a cup of coffee for love nor money.
4,Nespresso C120,"I had Nespresso C120 for a year. I loved the test of the coffee, but to me water was not getting hot enough. I don't know if there was a settings for the temperature but, i just couldn't get it hot enough. I am thinking about buying Nespresso D290 now, can any body help me about the water temperature information please before I buy this machine. I do like my coffee very hot by the way, most of the time I have to tell people at the coffee shop that I would like to have my coffee extra hot, then I get the temperature I like. Thank you,"
2,good machine terrible company,"This company knows how to lock up profits. Tried ordering, you must join ""the club"" and have coffee ordered in advance...but what happens if you run out? You better be prepared to wait 10 days....I tried ordering from them and 4 times they refused my credit card because even though I imputed it correctly online and then called 3 times giving them the correct information, each time they put East in my street address instead of SE.Don't like that I can't run to the local mkt and pick up some quality beans if we have alot of company who all enjoy espresso with dessert and then run out. I would recommend against this machine because they are so exclusive. Other than that if they simply had some agreement with any one of the popular flavors with say, Safeway or some international chains, I'd go for it. Like my coffee too much to play the run around game...they just make it way too hard."
3,Not what I was expecting,"So, I thought I was getting a nespresso that helped with the milk too - I didn't realize that the nozzle on the right (which looks like the steamers at coffee shops) was for hot water, not for milk. So needless to say, I was pretty bummed. But as an espresso machine it definitely does the job. I'm pissed at nespresso because they sent me an email telling me how important it is to clean it out but then want me to spend even more money to buy something to clean it out. In the future, I wouldn't have gotten such a high end one - I have friends that have the Keurig kind - work just as well and overall much less expensive."
2,Questionable Quality,"I purchased this machine, enjoyed ONE cup of espresso and then the machine broke. No reasoning behind it. Spent two calls with customer service (they were great), but the machine was beyond repair and I had to take it back. Something about a router problem. My thinking is that a $500 machine should have the kinks worked out before it hits the shelf. Luckily I had just purchased it from a local retailer so I didn't have to hassle with postal. I'm going back to Saeco."
5,"A ""must have"" resource for all skill levels of clowning","David Ginn's CLOWN MAGIC is well written and beautifully illustrated, giving the reader a wealth of information. He covers a wide variety of ""magic"" skills from the presentation to the actual production of the illusion. This is a must for those in the clowning/magic entertainment field."
5,The Best,"This is a very good book. It teaches you a lot on clowning not just funny magic tricks but also how to behave as a clown. This book was very helpful to me and I'm shure it will be helpful to you to. If you are thinking of buying a clowning book, this one should be at the top of your list."
3,what the !!@#$#@,I give it a 3 only for the fact that it is SUBLIME the other two stars are missing for a very large what the H*ll were they thinking when they only put 10 best of's.....what about the rest of them? Caress me Down !!!!
2,?????????,"A millenium collection?? Of Sublime? One would expect to see at at LEAST a 2-cd set with about 40 songs. Instead there were a small, pathetic ten. All of the songs on this collection are good, yes, but not even a dozen songs comes not even close to doing these musical gods justice. These ten songs aren't even their best."
2,Not Enough,I rated this cd so low because it does not appeal to me nor do I think it appeals to many other sublime fans. I dont think you really get the feel of sublime by just listening to there greatest hits. Songs like Boss Dj is where the real Sublime shows through. I dont think this would be a very good buy for people who have never listen to sublime because it doesnt let your taste for sublime grow. I really like every single sublime song i have ever heard. If I were new to Sublime I would go out and buy 40oz to Freedom
2,"Good for what it is, yet doesent do Sublime any justice.","Song wise, this is a great cd. This has all of the mainstream Sublime radio hits, and they're pretty darn good. Overall though, this could have been so much more. Yet, this is 20th Centure Masters were talking about. The vast majority of the 20th Century Masters cds are under ten songs, and dont do the artists any justice, so I really wouldent reccomend buying these unless you just want a few radio hits. I hope one day we get a proper Sublime collection, though. More like Pure Cult (The Cult's greatest hits cd) or even like '....And Love Said No' by Finnish rockers H.I.M. Even if you're a new Sublime fan, their self titled would be much better if you are just getting into them. Heck, that has more than half of the songs on here and only costs a few extra bucks. You'll thank me later."
1,Edits?!!!,"Okay There are only ten songs...And they're edited for content...if you don't want to buy all of the albums, get a copy of their greatest hits album, at least then you have the choice of explicit lyrics or not."
1,Don't buy a Whynter,"On 11/15/10 I purchased the Whyntner WC28S Sno 28. It worked for exactly 90 days. Unfoturnately we threw away the box at day 60. We called Whynter and while they will ""honor the one year warranty"" they won't pay for boxing the refigerator and they won't pay for the shipping even though the product is defective. Amazon may be able to get bulk rates to ship it to consumers but on our end the shipping alone was quoted at $120 plus the special boxing that Whynter wanted which is a special box in a box. Bottom line it would have cost $180 to ship the piece of crap back to them. The warranty is a joke. when the unit stopped working the temprature inside the unit was hotter than the outside. Avoid this company. The products are not well made."
2,Ok product but died after ~2.5 years.,"I bought the 28 bottle unit just over 2 years ago, in part because it had a lock, and the price. It worked okay until a few weeks ago when the fan started making noises whenever it turned on. Then a few days ago it just died and stopped cooling at all. Luckily I have a built-in U-Line Echelon wine refrigerator in my third floor game room where I store my ""nice"" wine, so I just transferred the wine from my ""working wine collection"" upstairs. U-line Echelon Series 48 Bottle Wine Cooler - Stainless SteelThis product only has a 1 year warranty and at less than $200 it is cheaper to buy a new one than have it repaired. I am looking for a new wine cooler that doesn't cost >$2,000 like the U-Line, but good enough quality to last longer than 2 years."
1,Not so great,"I purchased the Whynter wine cooler as a replacement to another cooler which gave up the goat after 5 years. The Whynter looks great and does cool but at the cost of significant noise polution, at least the one i received. Others may not be so noisy, possibly the one i received was damaged in shipping (given the excellent packaging I don't think so) or faulty but it was loud enough to be distracting and irritating. The other vendor's product and the one i finally went with was absolutely quiet. Read other reviews but I won't try this brand again."
2,Whynter WC28S SNO Wine Cooler,"I bought this cooler on July 11, 2012. It arrived by UPS in a poorly packed box. None of the interior shelves was secured. After carefully taking the cooler out of the box. I discovered the top door hinge was broken and the door almost feel off. The whole unit looks cheaply made. I asked to retun it. Amazon promptly sent UPS back to pick it up the next day. With promise of a full refund and no shipping charge. Thankfully I bought thWhynter WC28S SNO 28 Bottle Wine Cooler, Platinum with Lockthis item from a reputable source."
1,didnt make 6 months,"I had two issues with this piece of junk. first after only a couple of months the door started to fall apart, it came apart at the corner and I had to repair it with tape didnt look so good. Next in under 6 months the unit stopped working altogehter. Going to try and get a refund."
4,"Stable, Quiet","Clean look. Quiet, but it emits a slight ""burn"" smell when cooling. Temperature seems accurate. I set the wine temp to 13 C. I'll buy another and make a table around them. It's been two months, I'll wait two more based on the other reviews."

4,Dora is a crabby child saver!,"My daughter loves Dora the Explorer, so this dvd set saves many a crabby day. The only reason I didn't rate it a five is because on each dvd if you want to watch the ""bonus episodes"" you have to go through the menu extensively to get to them. It is kind of a hassle. It is worth the wait though!"
5,Dora the explorer,This DVD collection is excellent. My son is 2 years and 3 months old and he loves all three DVDs. He asks us to play it over and over again.
5,great for toddlers,This collection was a big hit for my 2 years old son. It is very educational and it attracts his attention for hours.
2,only 12 episodes!!!!!!!!,"For costing just shy of 30 bucks it should have more episodes!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU WANT MORE EPISODES LOOK ELSEWHERE, other than that I like it and so does my little girl."
3,some repeat episodes in packet,"Only one of the DVD's is really entertaining, some repeated episodes included in bonus episodes. Only plays main episode once, then you have to click through the menu to find bonus tracks."
3,Repeats!,"My daughter is a huge Dora fan, and loves watching this. I love it because of what she's learning from the how.However, about half the episodes on it turned out to be ones we'd already seen from other Dora dvds. What was the point of releasing this? And we also found the whole 'bonus' episode billing a complete joke...bonus implies that it's extra, but the so called bonus just brought it to the usual amount of episodes."
3,Not for kids under 3,"I watched one DVD ""with"" my 2 year old niece. While she loves Dora, apparently she's not all that interested in watching her on DVD. I'm hoping it will grow on her as she gets older and can begin to understand what is going on with Dora. She continues to love all the other Dora merchandise (dolls, memory game, action figures etc.) but the DVD .. I guess she has to be a bit older.I however, or should I say the ""kid in me"" did enjoy the DVD."
5,Great for dancers -- and everyone!,"I am a former professional ballet dancer, now in my sixties and still taking ballet classes twice a week. I have studied yoga with Mimi for five years, and get special benefits from her excellent Deep Stretch classes, which help keep me flexible enough to still dance at my age! I love this DVD, and my husband and I do all, or part, of it on days when I can't make it to an actual class. Mimi's presentation is clear, relaxing, and unhurried, and gives just the right amount of time for the poses. I feel refreshed in mind and body at the end of a session. Thank you, Mimi!"
5,Favorite Stretch DVD,"This is my absolute favorite stretch video. I own several but always seem to select this one to use, time and time again. When you have finished one, two, or all of the segments you feel wonderful. I would recommend this to anyone."
2,subpar,"the production values are awful: music mastered too loud over the voice over, white outfit on white background makes it hard to tell what instructor is doing with her body, really monotonous voice.but the real problem here is that all this is a super slow regular vinyassa yoga routine, not yin yoga, so you get neither the feeling that you've exercised nor that you've meditated. the stretches in real yin yoga are ten times more deep and satisfying than in this video.also, boo to amazon because the streaming video quality is piss poor and the interface SUCKS"
4,A window into immigrant life in America.,"I'm currently taking HIST 134 at CSU, Chico by the author and this book is one of the bright spots of the class. It paints a clear but not always unbiased opinion of what life was like for minorities as well as immigrants in the United States.This book covers immigrant life in America from the earliest colonies until the 1970's. The book seems to cover all of the major bases while being relatively objective."
4,Really a Iron Grip but too tight!!,"It is good but really a Iron grip on you. It is little tight for average guys but definitely not a deal breaker!!If its girth and dimensions details are on display, it would help buyers to choose with more confidence!!"
1,only 3 condoms,"I purchase the same condoms before and i remeber it has 36 condoms. This time i got only 3 condoms for $6, are you kidding me? I am going to return it."
1,3 Pack of Condoms for 36 Count Price,"The condoms themselves are fine, but you get 3 of them for the price of 36.They don't list the count in the description, so I can't blame them for being cheapskates & taking advantage of that, but I'm kicking myself for getting screwed over.Buy the condoms. Don't buy them from this listing."
2,little,these might be ok if your getting them for a new born. way to small. can finally squeeze into it but takes so long it isnt worth the hassel
3,Used after bunion surgery...,My doctor recommended i buy these to use after bunion surgery. He said to cut the top of the big toe off so it isn't as snug. This did help keep the toes aligned but it wasn't that comfortable. I am sure nothing would have been comfortable after surgery. Was happy to finally remove it but it did the job.
4,"Pricey, but....","It's expensive, but very comfortable. Not sure if the material that it was made of will last. I already have bunions so this is just to prevent it from getting worse. I also use toe separator for couple of minutes to an hour a day and then use the bunion brace at bedtime."
2,The straussians are coming! the straussians are coming!,"It is ironic that one of the favorable reviews for this work of intellectual yellow journalism should come fronm a student at Boston College, which includes on its faculty a large number of cunning, evil, right-wing Straussians, bent on global conquest. One can see it now, Gingrich , furtively thumbing through Thoughts on Machiavelli, Dole, Poring through Spinozas critique of religion, and behingd them all, the GOdfather, the sinister Leo Strauss, whose cunning even extended to teaching liberal democrats such as William Galston, Cass Sunstien, and George Aastaplo.Dear God, I have even heard rumors that CATHOLIC PRIESTS are among this devils disciples. Watch out, the Straussians will getcha if you dont watch out."
1,LAUGH OR CRY?,"Difficult to know whether to laugh or cry over this rehash of Drury's 1988 pedestrian opus. The image of Newt Gingrich (on the cover) ""furtively thumbing through Thoughts on Machiavelli"" made me LOL! But the idea of Shadia Drury taking the measure of Strauss's body of work would be like, say, Mortimer Adler having the last word on the thought of Martin Heidegger, except that Mortimer was sincere, and better qualified (RIP). How do books like this get into print?"
5,Absolutely the best for the beginning Classic Guitarist,"Don't bother with the ""Sour Grapes"" review from the so called professional guitarist above. This book is quickly becoming the De-Facto standard teaching guide for the classic guitar. In the last three years I have had three seperate teachers and they ALL used this book somewhere in their teachings. The included warmup routine is worth the price alone. The practice routines are carefully organized in a way that allows you to pick the areas you feel need the most improvement. Thanks Scott for a great book. Well done!"
4,Thumb up,"A must if you are interested in getting intoBach Lute Suites For Guitar (Classical Guitar Series). If you are playing Bach's Lute Suites and are having difficulties---like me, this book will help."
5,Great Book,"Best overall technique book i've ever read, and i used to work at a music store for 2 years. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to straighten out their bad habits or learn new good habits in order to improve your coordination, speed, and reduce tension while playing all while improving your sound and of course, strengthening your fingers."
1,NO CD INCLUDED,I am only an beginning classical guitar player and I don't have the best music reading skills. I didn't notice the book did not come with a cd and was very disappointed one was not included. The other reviews are correct--this is not for beginners.
1,puerile waste of time,"i bought this book/dvd in the hope it would actually take me through various pieces for the classicl guitar. instead it spends overlong on things like nails, scales and arpeggios....having the lessons set in mocked up gym was so cheesy as to be embarrassing. all we got was the maestro zipping through some fine pieces...what i wanted was step by step instruction on how to play them!!! dont buy unless you have the intellectual capacity of a boiled potato"
1,Anemic and incorrect,"From having played professionally for many years, this little guide has some very serious mistakes on the care and filing of the fingernails. This is most detrimental to the welfare of the playing of a nylon string guitar, for anyone who evers wants to play well."
1,Nothing new,"I have like 15 years playing guitar, and this dvd didn't show me nothing that I did'n know, only the last 20 minutes of the dvd were new for me, but not really enough. If someone ask for me, I say ""NOT TO BUY THIS"""
4,No Pain No Gain,"This is as advertised. As long as you can read music, you will feel the pain. For me it was especially instructive towards left hand technique and developing independence of fingers. Don't expect this book to yield a concert program. It is not designed for that. It is designed for the player that wants to strengthen her or his technique to be able to take on more complex pieces."
5,Classical guitar excercises,This book is truly important for those starting out or for the more advanced players. The dvd goes over everything so you can see and read the material. Talked to some other guitar players and this book is certainly the one to have. Scott Tennant as done a great job and working over the excercises will make for stronger playing. Highly recommend.
3,"The pencil is great, the pen is not perfect","The pencil is great, 0.5mm - very sharp, very easy to work with it.The pen has a small defect, but it's too complicated to return it."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"I have to admit that it's hard to review this since I didn't finish it, but the book was so bad that I felt obligated to warn other people away from it. I don't care about at what speed the zombies move, or whether the phenomenon was disease born or some government experiment, I've seen better video game storylines than this. For anyone expecting to finally see a well written novel in the zombie attack theme, don't get your hopes up with this one."
5,great scary book,"this book is great i bought both books to this series. i loved both of the books they were gross, scary and made me want more. if your looking for a page turner this is it. enjoy it!"
2,"Bathroom reader zombie book, at best 1.8 out of 5","The story starts out interesting and unfortunately takes a turn on to lame road. Although not the worst of the zombies novels out there, the book does little to keep us interested. This is a novel of multiple story lines, none of which are truly explored or fulfilled.I feel none of the characters really give us anything to hope for, as none of them are painted very well. Toward the last 3rd of the book, description of scenes and events take a dramatic decline. Overall, I'd describe this as seeing an average movie with little to take home.I think the most enjoyable feeling of this books comes from the various scenarios one would be able to place themselves in. If you just can't get enough ""zombie"" this book will keep you from starving, but will by no means satisfy."
5,Very Good Young Adult or teen novel,"I must warn you, if you're a fan of Steven King, or some other ""Great Novelist"" you're in for a big let down. But I'm 14 and not a big reader, so after finishing Pride and Prejudice(barf), I could use some zombie action horror. I bought the second book not 2 days ago and I'm almost done with it. I've seen almost every zombie film out there, I own over 21 hours of zombie movies on DVD, and this is by far, and have read over 7 books on zombies and this is the shot to the head (zombie killing technique). It puts all other forms of zombie media to rest. So if you're tired of reading Harry Potter, and are looking for a good book to get yourself or your teen, Reign of the Dead is perfect."
3,No new twists to an old story,"I admit that I love Zombie fiction. There are some great ones out there. I had high hopes for this story. I really felt this could have been fleshed out (bad pun - sorry) much better. All of the characters seemed to be sketched lightly and I had no real reason to care about any of them. The end of the preacher and his followers was almost an afterthought. All in all, typical end of the human race at the hand of zombies story. Nice addition to the collection but not a great story."
2,Reign of the Dead,"A BIG disappointment! After following many glowing reviews, I purchased this book. Little did I know that the content reflects something out of a basic writing course. Characters and plot are shallow to an almost absurd degree. Chapters run, in some cases, only one page. The main characters are cardboard cut-outs. There is practically no tension in the story. The sudden, convenient ending (no spoilers here) came abruptly and without any logic.Max Brook's Zombie Survival Guide was a much better representation of the genre."
2,Marginally Entertaining,Good points:Fast moving plotCool genreStays loyal to its Romero movie rootsBad points:Huge gaping plot holesAnnoying protagonistsContrived dialogueAmateurish style and editing
2,Get This Man an Editor,"As far as zombie fiction goes, this story gets a solid ""ehhhh."" It's a connect-the-dots tale that all but files the serial numbers off of George A. Romero's zombie works. The few interesting ideas that crop up (a mention of an intelligent zombie, for one) are then tossed away and ignored completely. Characterization can only be called lacking, as well.One bit of advice for Mr. Barnhart...hire an editor, posthaste. Basic grammar goes out the window with the persistent run-on sentences, fragments, and gross misspellings. Phrases like ""he shuttered in fear"" (instead of ""shuddered"") and ""he was weary of the plan"" (instead of ""wary"") make reading the book a chore.All in all, it reads like a first novel, and I hope Mr. Barnhart learns from the experience and improves his craft. (All my criticisms aside, I've already purchased the sequel. What can I say? I'm a sucker for zombie stories.)"
2,Had Potential,"Yep, this book coulda been great. The concept is ripped right out of the NotLD movies. You remember, the dead rise for mysterious reasons, they eat the living, people struggle to survive, etc, etc. That's about how this tale goes too, all motions no depth. I really got the impression that this was planned on being a 2 parter, or maybe even a trilogy, considering that the ending was rather abrupt and without much resolve. I won't say what happens to the undead, or the humans for that matter, but it is pretty predictable once things get going. I'm sure that this could have been better. I'm actually giving a star higher than I normally would since this was his first novel, and I try to support anything that has to do with zombies. This is a good primer for a nice halloween zombie-fest, but little else. I usually read a book in under 4 to 5 hours if it's good, and I read this one on and off over a two week period. Sorry, I hope he gets better."
2,"Not awful, but not great either","This book is what it is. It has a plot, a familiar premise, and kills (pardon the pun) a few hours of time. I wouldn't say it's a great novel, but it's not worth trashing either. Depends on what you like to read."
2,"""When de ded walk senoir....we must stop de killing!""","Hmmm, Recent dead rise from the grave and kill the living. Very Original!!! Quick someone get my buddy George Romero on the phone, maybe he can buy the film rights!! Or maybe some Italian director if Romero is busy! HAHA Like Fulci, no wait he's dead!! Um... Bava, Rami, Umberti, Degatto........?????"
1,Dreadful,"Absolutely dreadful. Where was this man's editor? The plot is the sort of thing a pre-adolescent might dream up, the characters are as dull as can be, and my 5-year-old can construct a better sentence. At first, I kept reading because I thought there had to be a reason the book was this bad -- perhaps the author was playing some kind of trick on us. When it became clear he was serious, I started actually enjoying the book's awfulness, waiting to see how bad it could possibly get. Pretty darn bad, as it turns out, culminating in an absolutely ludicrous ending."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of zombie stories, so I figured I'd give this one a try. It's not that it was terrible exactly, but there was no spark. It felt like somebody input a bunch of things that would be expected in a zombie story into a computer program, and the computer generated a generic zombie tale.I'm pretty forgiving of zombie stories, but I've read fan fiction that has more energy in it than this. I'm not saying that Mr. Barnhart is a bad writer, but I didn't get the feeling that the story meant much to him. I ordered both this book and its sequel, so I was really expecting to like it."
5,If you love Neruda and Lorca...,"...you need to read David Rosenmann-Taub. As a long-time admirer of the other two authors - their lyricism, sense of tragedy, and panoramic view of life - it was a revelation to find another poet with so many of these same qualities but in an altogether different key. Yet Rosenmann-Taub's originality and depth of perception make reading him (dare I say it) an even more moving and challenging experience for me. The poems `Schabat' and ""Un gato coge a una mariposa..."" have touched me as only the greatest poetry can. Rosenmann-Taub recreates the Spanish language in ways I wouldn't have imagined possible."
3,"a good book for a beginner, but assumes intermediate skills","There is a lot of info on yarns in this book which is good for someone who cannot go to a yarn store to see and touch the yarns there. The illustrations are clear for beginners to learn how to knit and there is a great section on making your first sweater. There is also a good section on finishing, however, this section could have used more illustrations for beginners to learn finishing techniques. The patterns in this book are nice and even contemporary: pair of socks, cardigans, rolled-neck and cable pullovers, scarfs, hat with tassel, luxury shawl, and throws, but would not wow anyone looking for more fashionable items."
5,Great Book for Beginners!,"My serch for an introduction to knitting book has ended!! A Passion for Knitting had everything I was looking for in a knitting book. Detailed information on yarns and tools, step by step instructions with photos teaching the basics of this art form, instructions for reading knitting patterns (with a listing of common knitting terms and their abbreviations), and a variety of projects aimed at the beginning knitter. The above is only the first half of the book! The second half is dedicated to exploring the world of knitting, it's trends and traditions."
2,"Too much print, not enough knitting","For avid readers, rather than avid knitters, this book could be a hit. There is plenty of information about websites, yarn manufacturers, and knitting in general. As an avid knitter who has a vast collection of knitting books, the patterns don't tempt me to go to my yarn stash."
5,Love it,"I have had this kettle for a year. I have had no difficulties with the unit. Both the lid a cord of mine work just fine. I use this kettle at least twice a day, love it and I am purchasing one for my mom for Christmas."
5,Special teapot,"This is what I wanted and received from Santa. Heats super fast, looks elegant on the counter and it is so nice to have it hot and ready in a jiffy. Worth every penny. Plan to give one to my sister too when her birthday rolls around."
4,Nice Kettle,"This kettle has worked great since we got it. We especially like to use it when we have company over. Only thing I would like is a ""keep warm"" setting."
2,Disappointed,"We were impressed with how it looked. We wanted something a little fancier for the office but we had a hard time, almost impossible, keeping the ""On lever"" pushed down in order for the water to even boil. No matter which way we positioned the pot on the base it would click back up. I read the instructions again and again to make sure I was doing it correctly and nothing. We finally got fed up and decided to return it."
2,Leaky Kettle,"This kettle works great for boiling water, BUT when its done it slowly leaks water until its all out on your countertop. I have tried contacting Cuisinart support for help determining whether I have a defective kettle, or whether its just a poor design, but that have not replied to my repeated emails, and I don't have the time to spend on hold."
4,TRUE SUSAN JOHNSON FAN....!,"This was the fourth book of hers i've read and i loved it. The heroine in courageous and willful, like every woman wants to be when tempted by a truly hot and sexy man. The love scenes are fabulous, especially the part about his special ""Harem"" bed. Susan Johnson just gets better and better with each book. I love that her women are strong-minded, independent and outspoken. Her men are all sexy and men most women would dream about. She writes a story that is romantic as well as emotional. I'm hooked !"
3,Forbidden,I agree with the other reviewers. The sex was hot but the storyline was boring. And really to keep going back to be beaten and hurt makes no sense to me.
2,Not particularly interesting...,"It's not a bad read, but its very unusual for me to be able to put a book down after I get into it and not get back to it rather quickly.But I made it about halfway through yesterday, put it down, and have no desire to pick it up again. Maybe when I'm really bored or something. I guess nothing in the story is really grabbing me. It's been a dry read so far, maybe the second half is better, but at this point, it just doesn't seem worth the trouble."
3,"Not bad, but could be better!","...what a waste of money. Etienne and Daisy are two characters that are fully developed and are totally loveable but the storyline is not develop fully. I agree with another read and would say that this book could have been cut down by a few hundred pages. I love the way Etienne and Daisy appear as strong, independent characters, which I personally think is the best SJ characters ever but it just lack the fire and passion of her other books. But I love SJ so I will continue to read her book and hope she improves on this one."
1,"""Penthouse"" is Cheaper Trash","I can't imagine anyone classifying this as ""romance."" It ought to be moved to the ""erotica"" category."
3,Nice looking watch but very heavy,"The watch looks great and seems to be very high quality, though I'd argue that the black dial version (currently not sold on Amazon) looks even better. Also the watch is pretty heavy - both the bracelet and the watch itself are a little thicker and a little heavier than you'd expect from looking at it online. Or maybe I just need to get some exercise. Either way, I recommend checking out the watch in person before buying."
4,A Great Watch at a Great Price!!,I have had my eye on this particular watch for about six months. The price was a little too steep for me until I seen the cost Amazon was charging. At first I hesitated because I never ordered jewelry on line but since it was Amazon and the price was right I decided to take a chance. I am very happy with my choice and the price I paid. Thank you.
3,Needs more capacity info,"An ordinary product that could have been great if it had more info on capacity:More info and breakdown on Ounces, cups, etc. should be engraved on its side.This way, it is just another container to hold things and measure some very few, seldom used amounts."
1,Will not sustain 24 hour operation.,"I've gone through two of these, and each one of them has broke on me. The first one was on a timer, and that one broke and the second replacement one was on 24/7, and that one also broke."
1,Lack of information,"Why does the specification for this product neglect to state whether the tubes are T8 (1"") or T12 (1 1/2"")? T12 tubes are going to be phased out -- this phase out could affect your decision on whether to buy a fixture where bulbs may be more difficult to procure.Why does the specification not mention the Sound rating of the ballast: Class A, B, or C? (Class A is the quietest.)I do not own this; I'm giving this product the lowest rating because of failure to specify information which should be important to a buyer. If Amazon updates the information about this product specifying the ballast's Sound rating and what kind of bulb this fixture takes, then this rating should be ignored."
4,D'oh!,"The photo with this listing is incorrect. The package actually contains Julia Carpenter Spider-Woman, in her navy and white costume, rather than Jessica Drew in red. Still a nifty figure, but...not the same."
3,"Probably fine for bikes, but not for water rockets!","I'm going to break down & buy a Dutton-Lainson Goldenrod 140, but this was my second dime-store pump that failed pumping water rockets (at the end of a 30 foot hose for safety - they do explode sometimes) to 100-120 psi.I believe the problem is check valves heating up until they stick, but when trying to disassemble this pump to check the check, I tore the o-ring that sits between the barrel and the base. This seems to be a weak spot of the pump as it leaked there a bit when I first bought it until I cranked down the retention ring a bit.The cross section of the ring is triangular rather than the common circle (i.e. doughnut) so isn't replaceable. PlanetBike pumps have $5 rebuild kits available.The pump did reach 120 psi with a 200 lb. pumper at the handle. Lighter people inflating racing tires might want to use a narrower-bore pump."
2,Bell Airstrike 1900,Good pump at first but tubing between pump and Gauge deteriorates and breaks making pump unusable also the tubing from the gauge to the fill lever does the same of coarse.
3,Good basic floor pump,"This pump seems to be reasonably well made, but the gage is not very accurate and it will only inflate bike tires to about 70 lbs. It is worth the price if you don't need to reach a higher pressure. This pump is correctly labeled as the Airstrike 1900."
2,Laborious prose for a laborious read,"Two stars may not be a fair rating of this book. I myself couldn't get beyond the first few pages. The author's first concern seemed to be to flaunt his showy ""poetic"" prose style in sentence after sentence like this one: ""I waited for the purple bus to travel through these places edging the round cratered lake where something large from the sky struck long ago, places where the blacktop road sinks through soft-bottomed bogs and erupts flat and dry farther on, a serpentine plumbing of the earth's thin surface, the purple bus leaning on the quicksand curves, slipped tires spinning, the exhaust pipes gurgling, the white-eyed driver mostly blind and dreaming them along the road he drove, steering the bus to where I always slept in wait."" Phew. Purple indeed. If this is the kind of writing that turns you on, you'll find plenty of it here."
1,S**tworth book--would not use it to wipe my a$$,"Dear prospective Fishboy readerz: please spare yourself this wannabe poetic prose style. You'll only want to suffocate after holding your breath through unbearably long sentences, you'll want to gouge your eyes out with this BLINDINGLY INCONCEIVABLE IMAGERY, while mind-boggling, trippy thoughts in this ""coming-of-age"" tale just put your mind in a nightmarish state.Seriously, spare yourself the change and get a shotgun shell instead, so maybe you can pump it into Mark Richard for writing this awful book to begin with.Thank you."
5,A trip worth taking,"This book serves as a parable and fable. It is a strange world which Fishboy lives in, and the beautiful way the book is written will no doubt lead to strange dreams, as it did with me."
5,Fishboy's a ghost you can bond over!,"Fishboy became part of our multi-coastal family in ways we could not of imagined! The story of Fishboy worms into your brain right from the beginning, and each chapter stays with you, like the taste of the ship cooks' soup! We love Fishboy and his shipmates;even the ""weeping man who says ----"". I challenge readers to see how long they can go before they peek at this story a second time."
2,Disappointing,"I didn't really like this book very much at all. This could be, in part, because I had pretty high expectations for it. After all, according to the book's description, it combined two of my favorite elements in literature: the ocean and feral children. But, much like the sea the book revolved around, my interest lapsed in and out with the regularity of the tide. There would be a fascinating snippet, the imagery-laden text sucking me in, but it would be inevitably followed by a paragraph-long single sentence so heavily overwritten, my interest would completely deflate. I am just so disappointed that I didn't enjoy this more, but at least it was a short novel."
5,Love the older versions of the BC,This video provided great video time for the long car rides. Good to have some variety of old and new versions of blue's clue.
3,Like Blues Clues - don't like Steve's replacement,"Nothing personal toward 'Joe'...but he works too hard to appear natural and it gets in the way of his performance in Blue's Clues. Blue is the same, but we had a very hard time getting into the shows in this set because Steve is NO WHERE to be found. My toddler lost interest quickly.If you are hoping to see the original Blues Clues with Steve, get another set of DVDs. This one is labeled with Steve Burns, but he is NOT in this set. Sorry! Amazon needs to fix that typo."
3,Cute if your kid is in to Blue's Clues,"My autistic son was suddenly in to Blue's Clues, so we were scrambling to find some dvds for him to watch. These fit the bill and also taught him lessons involving numbers, colors and music. He loves music so that one is his favorite. It's a nice package for kids needing a Blue's Clues fix!"
3,Disappointed,I would have to say I bought this Collection thinking that it had Steve Burns on the DVD's how very disappointing to get it and find out that Joe is on it instead. My daughter will not watch Joe for anything. They need to get more DVD's with Steve on them. There great video's if your kids like Joe but if not don't waste the money.
1,Not as advertised...,"Bought this collection to replace my kid's copy of ""ABC's & 123's"" that broke. It contains 3 videos but not the ""ABC's & 123's"" noted in the title. Sent back for a return.Here's an idea. Why not list the 3 videos it does contain? Seems obvious..."
4,"Good Shows, Frustrating Set-Up","I got this for my toddler who loves ""Blues Clues"" to break out on a long car-trip. While he and I love the videos (they're fun, calm, educational, and entertaining), the way these DVD's are set up is frustrating. Each one has four shows, but only two are accessible from the main menu, the other two are found in a ""Bonus Episodes"" section, so ""Play All"" isn't an option. After playing the first two episodes, I had to pull off the interstate so I could see the DVD screen and navigate to the proper menu and get the other episodes going. Unfortunately, I only found this out when I was going 70mph and got yells of frustration from my toddler in the back seat!All in all, this is a great collection of ""Blues Clues"" episodes, but a pain to navigate through them!"
5,Best price for 3 dvd,"Nothing can't complain 3 new DVD for $19.99 with free shipping.It's just I love Amazon! Glad I found it. It is expensive even at ebay.My children love those dvd, watching over and over..good for educational as well. Learning colors, shapes, ABC and more. This 3 dvd teaches basic important things for pre-schooler to kinder children for sure."
3,"I really, really wanted to like this book...","...but it was just so unrelentingly dull. Even the interesting parts (Anatomy books bound in HUMAN FLESH!) were dull, or presented in a fashion that made them dull. The detail was exquisite, but the presentation was...not. And some of the descriptions of avid book collectors and their manners of storing, arranging, and displaying their books made me want to back away, very slowly, towards the nearest exit.For anyone interested in the history of books and the ways in which they have been stored, I recommend this book for the wealth of information it provides. It's a pity it couldn't be presented in a more interesting manner."
4,"A ""must have"" for bibliofiles","I found Petroski's book on the evolution of bookshelves and libraries fasinating. For those that love books and the history about them, this is the book for them! I found it hard to put down, but then I am an addicted bibliofile!"
3,if you're not bored by the concept,"This is a book about the history of the bookshelf. It also covers some history of books. Not the literature of books, but the manufacturing and design of the actual paper and cover.If that idea doesn't bore you to death then this is a very well written book. It will definitely tell you an awful lot about bookshelves, and if that doesn't scare you then you might want to read this book."
2,Wow. Talk about focus on a niche area.,"This is a study not really about books. Nor a study really about bookshelves. But it's a study about how books look the way they do -on- bookshelves.Why are books organized vertically and not horizontally? Why are books organized spine out and not spine in? Why do bookshelves look the way they do? ...You get the idea.If you harbor these questions as your compelling inquiries, then this book will be the one that frosts your cupcakes. I love books, too. It's only that, to me, this was such an exceptionally limited and narrow field examination that forced a myopia on a wider and much more exciting world.It's good. Fine research and depth. It's just that with our finite and invaluable time, there's just so much more out there of greater scope in life to savor. No?"
2,For Librarians Only,"This is in essence a brief history of library design, fleshed out to book length by Petroski's memories of the bookshelves in his life. It is primarily not (as are his other books) a framework for his theories of industrial design, which are barely mentioned.Petroski is obviously a booklover and has thought the many things, profound and mundane, that booklovers think about their books. But reading about his thinking about them is not a particularly interesting or enlightening experience. If the layout of libraries intrigues you then there is interesting information here. Otherwise, there really isn't much point."
2,Windy and boring,"I'm as fascinated by history and technology as the next person, but this book seems to be an overstretched monograph, marked by redundancy and needless recitation. Properly edited, the story of the bookshelf would take far fewer pages. There is no reason to cite nine examples to prove that rows of lecterns with books chained to them were common c1600, for example. I'm willing to try other titles by this author--he is curious about interesting things and writes readably--but the subject matter here doesn't fill a book, in my opinion."
4,The ordinary is made fascinating.,"This book is thoroughly researched, well illustrated and written without engineering jargon so that the general reader will enjoy the story of the book and the shelf. I will forever look at libraries with renewed appreciation for not only their content but their structure. This book is a good complement for those bibliophiles who have read A Gentle Madness by Nicholas Basbanes."
4,"good, but not great","Henry Petroski has done it again--describing the evolution, engineering and quirks of objects we all take for granted. Unfortunately, this Petroski effort isn't nearly as engrossing as his book on the pencil. But for bibliophiles and library lovers, I can't recommend this tome enough. Truth be told, there really have only been a handful (or two) of significant changes to bookshelf design over the last 500 years. Somehow, Petroski is able to expand on these subtle changes and create an entire book on the subject. It's fascinating, but ultimately you're left wondering why it took nearly 300 pages for this story to unfold."
3,Quite good though not his best work,"It's not quite as fascinating as Petroski's ""The Evolution of Useful Things,"" but I suspect that is because ""The Book on the Bookshelf"" is much more narrowly focused (the design of bookshelves, the structure of book bindings and, to a lesser extent, the organization of libraries). But it is a quick read and one that bibliophiles should find terribly interesting."
4,Proven to be effective in real businesses,"Answers the question ""how should I be working with field sales."" Contains tables, worksheets, lists, and step-by-step approaches with examples. The problem will be getting an entire sales and marketing team to adopt it. Even if they don't, after reading this book, you may find you relate to your sales force in a different, more productive manner. The only reservation I have about this book is that for the concept to be truly effective, an entire work team must complete the training described in the book. I know from personal experience that, when a work team completes the training, it works, and works well. The book, as well as it may be written, cannot substitute for the group training. If it did, I would rate it a 10+."
3,Needs more illustrations & photos,"This was a very good book, no doubt. It would have helped immensely to have more photos or illustrations of features being discussed, especially fronts & rears.Overall I didn't find it that helpful. I'm sure the seminar another reviewer mentioned would've been really helpful where things are being demonstrated. I'm not sure I'd read this again since I'd already read ""THE DOG IN ACTION"" by Mcdowell Lyon. I found a few word-for-word matches in this book and ""AN EYE FOR A DOG"" by Robert W. Cole. I hope this was unintentional by both authors."
5,Great Technical Book on Canine Structure,"This book is a ""must have"" for anyone interested in canine structure. Great illustrations and pictures help explain what would otherwise be difficult to understand subject matter. The information is very enlightening and presented in an easy-to-read format. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will definitely recommend it to others."
5,Excellent!,"An excellent, well-written guide for the dog fancier wishing to understand the terminology and the ""why"" of various dog breed structures and movement. A resource to be read and reread, consulted often."
4,K-0 Structure and Terminology,"I purchased this book after attending a Seminar given by Mr. Gilbert. He made a great many good points, but I wanted to read the book to firm them up in my mind. It is a very good work on the subject of canine conformation and terminology."
1,Zipper does not stay closed,"This would be a great product if the zipper stayed closed. It has popped open on every bag I've used (I'm halfway through my second box because I bought two boxes originally).I am now writing an amendment to my review after some time has passed. This is because I went back and read reviews of this product by others. Other people said the zipper only breaks when the bag is overstuffed. I beg to differ. None of the zippers in my two boxes held at all, and I definitely did not overstuff the bags. I think the zipper issue is a manufacturing defect. I wrote to the company, and they sent me a coupon for a free box. They didn't respond to my question about whether or not it was a defect that has since been fixed."
3,Closure breaks if too full,"These bags work for the most part, but if you fill them too full the closing mechanism breaks. Then you have to manually pinch them closed each time, which can be annoying. They should work on making the closures stronger for such large sized bags. Great price for so many items though."
3,Long time coming...,"I was familiar with the Hefty Freezer bags, as are most folks. It stated online that it would ship within 3 days and coming from Atlanta. I live in Georgia and it took a good 2 weeks to get here--very frustrating when I have to put my project on hold for over a week waiting for supplies. Would have given 5 stars if the delivery was timely."
1,useful size but useless because of faulty closure,These never close properly. Very often I have found that the seams have opened despite the zipper not having moved.
5,Excellent,"Where else can you find a zip loc see through plastic bag that is 2.5 gallons. Its large, does a great job and makes for storing larger items a breeze. I really enjoy this item and wish more companies would make them."
5,One of the best purchases I've made . . .,"These bags are so versatile. Not only can you store food but anything else you want to keep clean and dust free and because they're clear, you see right away what's in the bag. They'll also be very useful for when I travel. I will buy these bags again."
4,Handiest storage bags for projects,"I love the 2.5 gallon bags. I do quilting and they're really handy for storing fabric and notions for each project. It's also handy for kid's crafts with a box but small items that invariably fall out. They stay IN. The only con is that the hefty zipper is flimsy so if you overload it at all, the clip might come off or the zip part won't work. Regardless - until someone new comes out with an improvement on this (or a 3 gal. size), this is my favorite for MANY things. They're not always easy to find, so I just ordered a bunch so I wouldn't have to keep looking for them."
5,Necessity for MTs,"This book offers the medical transcriptionist a list of lab values for various tests, which I have found indispensable as not only an MT but for helping friends understand labs they may have had. It is great for a list of various laboratory tests and different pathologies."
5,Richard,I love the way King B's peppered beef jerky tastes it does'nt have that sweet taste like most of the other brands have.
3,not a self-contained book,"Compared to the one edited by Tocci(Optical interconnections), this book is new but provides no further theoretical explanation. I suggest using Tocci's book."
2,Have had three of these since 2007,"So far it is the best for space, and portability. However, the top flap cracks with in a year of use. I usually cover it with some black vinyl tape to make it last a little bit longer. But it looks like crap. Not replacing it this time.Solo Vinyl Rolling Catalog Case"
2,Not very well made,I just received this case. It came damaged with a big gouge on the side along with cracked plastic that surrounds the hole the handle goes through. The telescoping handle doesn't stay up well. You put a little pressure on it and it slips all the way down. I had to return the case because of the damage and chose not to get a replacement because I found it too cheaply made.
5,Just what the Boss asked for!,The case arrived quickly and was eactly what my Boss wanted. Roomy inside w/o a bunch of dividers he did need. It is used for carrying lega size files that are usually very thick. Perfect!
1,"Dubious claims, expensive product",These perform no better than a good paper filter and they can even damage some of your sensors in your engine by putting oil into your air stream. They are also thicker than paper filters (think a t-shirt versus a paper towel). I think these are way over-priced and then you still have to buy the expensive special cleaner and oil for them.You are better of just getting one of these for a lot less moneyPentius PAB7764 UltraFLOW Air Filter. The performance is even better.
1,ummm..,"I love Billie Burke, but I couldn't get though the first few chapters of this book. It was full of 1950's crap like ""get up before your husband, and put your makeup on"" ""never let him see you looking less than beautiful"". Really?? I haven't read her first book, ""With a feather on my Nose"", but I want to. I think it's full of her actual life and experences. I've been married 24 years, and I've never gotten up earlier to primp. So Yay! for Billie for a fantastic career, but yuck to this book."
2,Disappointing,"I bought two of these toys for my 7 and 5 year olds who both wanted electric guitars for Christmas. I didn't think they were ready for the real thing so I bought the MiJam guitar as a compromise. When I received the product I was very disappointed. It is VERY small (about the size of a todler's toy guitar) and does not have strings. It looks like a cheap small plastic toy, not at all like the full-sized guitar pictured on the box being played by a teenager. For the price I should have realized how unrealistic it would be, but I think the product description is misleading. The product age range seems to be greatly over-estimated. I can't imagine any child over 4 being happy with the item."
3,MiJam is pretty good.,My son got the MiJam guitar for Christmas. It is a cute toy. I thought it would be a little bigger. I was disappointed that there is no speaker on the guitar so he has to wear headphones to hear it as we haven't found any of our audio equipment to fit the jack for the guitar. He's five and headphones are not so much fun on a little head. I think we'll buy the amp and headset that go with it and it might make it better.
4,Quality Product,"It is a good, quality product. I haven't driven enough miles to see if it really improves gas mileage or performance. Cleaning the filter rather than changing the conventional air filter twice a year, it will pay for itself in a year."
2,The Glory Feild,"The Glory Feild is story about civil rights throughout the ages. The book is about a family, from the time when they were shipped to America as slaves, to present times, when they have nearly equal rights. All through the book the family is descriminated and called racist names. They must live through being cheated, and being thought useless by the white people. They must pay taxes, but have no political say. As you progress through the book the times get better and better, and the African americans get more and more rights. I thought the book was informative, but not a great read. It had some good points, but the book its self was not great in my opinion. The book was sort of choppy and hard to follow, and you could not really get to know the characters. I give this book 2 stars for those reasons."
2,A somewhat mediocre read...,"Well...this book is not exactly what I would call exciting. It's one of those books that your teacher assigns you and you HAVE to read it whether you like it or not. I think the book would have been better had I not been forced to read it. The plot is good for, oh, the first two generations and then it gets old. Know what I mean? If you are a teacher and are trying to teach your students something about family traditions and the difference between one generation and the next, then give them this book. But I am warning you (and this is a heartfelt response from an eighth grade English student!) be prepared for quite a bit of grumbling about this novel."
3,The Glory Field,"I think this book ""The Glory Field"", was okay. There were some things I didn't understand about the book, but there were some interesting parts in the book, for example they talked about slave's daily life. I think that was interesting. It was cool about how the author had describe to us about the suffering the African Americans had because it is like we can really experienced what it feels like. They wanted so much to be free that they will almost do anything. Mostly this book is about racism and about slavery. African Americans are trying to reach their dreams that they always wished for. I think this book would teach everybody the history of the African American people and more about the subject, ""slavery"". I think whoever reads the ""The Glory Field"" would really like it if they like to learn about history."
4,An excellent book for junior high and high school teachers.,"""Glory Field,"" is a very interesting book. Walter Dean Myers does an excellent job developing several different characters to make their lives very interesting to the reader. The book is quite similar to Alex Haley's ""Roots,"" but it is not quite as harsh. It is a wonderful book for teachers of junior high or high school English or History. It is easy to follow and appeals to the reader's emotions, but is not offensive."
4,Interesting,"The Glory Field by Walter Dean Myers was interesting/cool book that truly held my attention. This wonderful book is about a strong family that overcomes incredible hardship. The Lewis family spans nearly 250 years. This story of the Lewis generations traces their on-going battle for freedom and equality. I was truly amazed with the perseverance and courage the characters showed in this book. Each generation has its own unique story with sorrow and joy. It gives the reader a glimps of what slavery was like, knowing that what the African-americans truly went through was absolutley horrifying. A thought provoking story that everyone should read."
3,Quite slow... very boring,I read this for school over the summer. I never got into it. I think each part of the book was too short for you to really get to know the character. But the idea of having a story of the generations of family was a good idea.
3,The Glory Field,"The Glory Field book is about the history of an African-American family over two hundred and forty years. There were stories of Muhammad, traveling from West Africa on a slave ship, and Lizzy who breaks the bonds of slavery.This novel follows six generations of the Lewis family. At the turn of the twentieth century, Elijah saves his family's South Carolina land called ""The Glory Field,but then they are forced to leave the home he loves. In the Depression in Chicago, Luvenia resolves to achieve success when her dream of a college education is shattered. The final section of the book concerns a teenager name Malcolm, who follows his cousin from Harlem to the Lewis family reunion."
2,I thought that the book was ok,"The Glory Feild is about the troubles of 5 teenage generations of a struggling black family line. The family line experiences troubles of racism and segregation. My opinion of the book is that it was very well done. The only problem I found was that the author jumped the characters around to much. It was confusing having so many characters. Besides the characterazation problem the plot of the story was done well. I found that the book as a whole was mildly interesting. My ovrall score of the book, out of 5 stars was 2 stars."
5,a great family book,"This is the story of a family. Who saw its first ancestor captured, bound, andbrought to this country from Africa. Where they live one person can just walk past theremaining shackles of their family members. Even today there are family members ofthese former slaves walking around. But most of all it is a story of pride, passion andhope.I thought it was a good book. It focused on family sticking together no matterwhat happens or what someone else tells you. The main characters really express theirtrue feelings of how it was back then. It almost gave me a mental picture of how badthey were treated. It was a fun book overall, I read it with my mom and my little brotherwe all had a good time."
3,The Glory Field,The Glory Field was very descriptive about the scenes and all but it really didn't catch my attention at all. In the beginning it talked about a family being slaves and how they struggled about everything. Around the middle it was very confusing so I kinda lost it. In this book I learned how slaves were treated. In this book the author decribes things like feelings and emotions really well. After generations have pasted each one 's better than the next. But you know good things comes with bad things. In The Glory Field there were way too much characters and because of that I got really confused. Nothing really motivated me to read on becuase there aren't really any exitement. After I read the book I almost didn't even remember the plots and scenes. Mainly I think this book is dealt on teachings and feelings about rights of colored people. On another hand if I hadn't read this book I would've missed out in some very important facts.
1,Caravan Liftgate Supports,"These are not as strong as the last ones I bought about 12 years ago even though they are the same brand and part number. They do hold the gate up with a few pounds to spare, but will not raise the gate like the old ones did.UP-Date: 12/08/2012 Even tho these are the same model and make as the ones that lasted 10 years, these only lasted about a month before they could no longer hold the gate up. I replaced them with a different brand (Sachs SG214001) and now you just unlock the door and stand back as the lifts move the door up!!!!!"
3,Now Voyager,"I bought this film simply because I'm a Pink Floyd fan - the epic 23min piece ""Echoes"" makes up one block of the sound-track for this film.There's minimal storyline. The first 50 mins is one of George Greenough's views on surfing, with loads of shots of him doing just that, along with him building a boat, which he then sails with two mates, including champion surfer, the Australian, Nat Young.The next part of the film features great under-water shots, made surreal by the aforementioned Pink Floyd music. It's a trip, man."
5,flexible,This is better than the blue tubing I bought here at amazon. I can make a loop with out kinking the tube. Good packaging too.
1,no toy,this is a difficult to find fuel line i am using to rebuild small engines . it definitly is what i needed and it was mailed directly to my front door .
5,Great Pocket Companion for All Levels of Astrologer,"I've been carrying the Maynard's for almost 10 years now. I am the worst when it comes to computing charts, but I like what's in this book. Clear, easy-to-understand daily aspects, with monthly tables in the back. It's a wealth of great info, and not too challenging...it's a great intro for new enthusiasts, while being completely functional for the more serious among us.I can't recommended this too highly - it's a great gift for your friends who are just learning. Kids can enjoy this. Phases of the moon, important dates, eclipse data...great artwork!"
2,A little dated and a little cheesy,"While I do have this book in my collection it is not typically the primary one I utilize when working with anger management. I find this book to have good information and the fact that it is in workbook format lends itself well to weekly therapy sessions. However, I do feel that there are many other books out there that do the same job much better. Finally the concept of a ""work out"" is a good idea but pretty cheesy. On the rare occasion I utilize this book with a client I almost always lead with a disclaimer of ""I know it's corny but work with the information not the corny concept""."
5,Dr Weisinger work book,This book was purchased for a class requested by my teacher. I bought this book used and is in excellent condition.
1,fair,"it is, as the first reviewer points out, quite inferior to kandarpa's gem. the prior review sounds like it was written by the author."
3,Catchy Melodies and a Poor Recording,"Vells have the drummer from Modest Mouse with them, so I decided to give them a try. Although classifying their sound is difficult, they have upbeat guitar and bass progressions mixed with keyboards creating a sound from the 50's or 60's. The recording of the CD is poor but it almost adds to how genuine the Vells are. The Vocals, although different, I grew to love. The Catchy Rythms and Melodies do get the best of you on some songs but the overall CD is hard to love as a whole. A Few Songs that capture Vells at their best are, ""In The Hours of Flowers"", ""Little Yellow Man"", ""Larger Than Life"" and ""Rhyme Sees Mine""."
4,Sonic Adventure DX review,"I don't play this game myself. I bought it for my 8 year old son to play on his Mac (via Windows XP on Parallels). He loves it. He's finished the game already, and he's playing it again. He's always telling me aspects of the game. He really thinks it's a great game"
2,Other Music in the film.,"Just thought that this list of the other tracks in the film( not featured on the soundtrack) might help:Bucwhead: ""Why'd They Make Me Bang""Burning Brides ""Plank Of Fire""Sheryl Crow ""Safe and Sound""Tim Easton ""Black Hearted Ways""Girls Against Boys: ""One Perfect Thing""Liars Inc""What's Inside Me""Leslie Mills ""The Good Life""The Promise Ring ""Happy Hour""Strike Anywhere ""S.S.T.""Tupinikings ""Menina D'Agua""Vibrolux ""Bang Bang"""
2,tom jones,This was one of the best cd's I've gotten of Tom Jones. I have all of his old records but this is even better.
2,Hokey,"The hypnotist's delivery was way over the top. His overly dramatic tone mixed with reverberation was so distracting that I couldn't relax. At the mellowist point in the CD he suddenly yells ""Stop Smoking Now!"" like he just caught his dog crapping on the carpet. If you're a person who likes the hoke, this may work. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and money."
2,Rather insipid pabulum: more Chicken Soup for Teen Leaders,"Indeed, ""Chicken Soup's"" Jack Canfield has a promotional blurb on this book's front cover. Fans of his work & the ""Teen Power"" series might be delighted by this volume. I guess I'm not w/in that target audience. This volume is essentially an anthology w/ many ""cutesy"" mini-essays on various sub-aspects of learning about leadership. But I can't see it appealing to too many student leaders beyond those in Jr. High."
5,"I went to a dave and the intelectuals concert, it was great","I haven't listened to the CD yet but I have gone to a Dave and the Intelectuals concert in Hibernia park for the Chester County Council Camporee in the fall of 1998. Over all, the concert was great, but it could use a light show. It was the highlight of my troop's(105)camping trip. My troop is from Exton, so we didn't have to travel far to the park."
2,Too encyclopedia like,"I had high hopes for this book and felt my excitement dwindle when I opened it. While it organizes it by bloom time it doesn't offer much after that. The information blurbs are more like quick at-a-glance fact. Perhaps this book is better suited for a more experienced gardener who just wants to quickly look up a plant or add a new one to their already existing garden. If you are a new gardener and looking for a more overall approach, advice, explanation of misgivings of plants then this book is not for you. I recommend Perennials for Every Purpose."
5,A good reference book for New England gardeners...,"Continuous Bloom is one of those books I refer to over and over again. Pam Duthie shows that it is relatively easy to keep perennial beds and borders looking good and in bloom from March through October in eastern North America. Two hundred and seventy-two of the best perennials, each with a full-color photo, are arranged in order of bloom time. For each plant, there is necessary information for home gardeners such as: plant hardiness zone, height/width, descriptions of flower and foliage, bloom time, light and soil requirements, care, propagation, and potential problems. A good investment for beginning as well as experienced gardeners."
3,"Carmen c8eye heated, battery operated eyelash curler",Ilove it. I finally have eyelashes that curl. Its like a curling iron for your eyelashes and it really works.
3,Disappointed,"Although I love Dick Van Dyke, and he does a wonderful job as he reads the story on the CD, I felt let down when I finished the book.As I read, I kept waiting for the plot to get better. To me the story line seemed a little sappy and very predictable...like every other tale that tries to tug at your heart strings.The pictures are beautiful, though!"
3,"Great songs, bad production","The Worldhood could have been the best of all NomeansNo post-Andy Kerr albums,but in the end, it turns out to be the weakest.Don't get me wrong, all songs except Victim's choice and Tuck it awy are masterpieces. Victim is a good song but it just doesn't fit with the rest of the album and Tuck it Away with its catchy and innocent chorus is a joke when compared to other evil-sounding songs.Why 3 stars then? One word:production. Sound quality is so BAD, specially on one of the best songs, State of Grace. But if you can dig it, then Worldhood is one very strong album. My Politics is my favorite NomeansNo song ever! Other highlights include: Humans, Angel or Devil, He learned how to bleed, I've Got a Gun, Lost, Predators, Jungle etc."
4,Solid NMN album [some songs=boring punk chord progressions],"Excellent production as always by the wright brothers and thier engineers. Most of the album sound like 'standard punk', except with dark demented Nomeansno lyrics. The last two songs are delicious, 'State of Grace' and ""The Jungle"". In my opinion, they are the treasures of this album. They keep up with Nomeansno's unique style of dark epics."
4,Broad coverage and useful treatment of financial terms,"For those who encounter unusual financial terms and need a quick understanding of them, buy this book. The book is especially useful when the authors go beyond simple definitions to get at the underlying concepts and cross reference a term to other related terms. For US readers, please don't be put off by the ""international"" in the title. This book will be useful to those who work in the US market exclusively."
5,This is awesome,Loved this product I felt so much more relaxed after I soaked in it.....It's awesome will get more when I run low
5,A Fascinating Story,"I have the video from ""The American Experience"" series and have shown it in my high school history class several times, much to the delight of my students, since many of them can readily identify with the young Evelyn Nesbit. Strangely enough, they seem to show much sympathy for Stanford White rather than for Harry Thaw and their feelings about the case are underscored when, at the end of the documentary, we are informed that on her deathbed Evelyn declared that Stanford White was the only man she had ever loved, understandable since, despite the age difference between the two, he showed her the love which she had lacked in her childhood as well in her subsequent marriage to Thaw, who readily abused her. A sordid but very human tale from a fascinating time period in our history."
5,"A Refreshing, Personal Look at Fathering","FATHERTIME provides a refreshing, personal look at fathering, very different from other books on the issue which are more analytical and detached . . . Many fathers will identify with [these stories], and fathers-to-be will draw great benefit as well . . . a series of 52 brief but inspiring stories . . . a delight to read.--excerpted from EVERYMAN: A Men's Journal, #48, April/May, 2001"
5,Absolutely Fabulous & Entertaining!,"""The dazzling real lives of the bearded ladies, the dog faced boys, the camel girl, the lobster boy, the frog boy, the lizard man and all the other strange carnival and sideshow performers."""
4,Good Read,"This book is well written, full of information on the lives of these unfortunate people and shows them a dignity they deserve."
5,Great Read,"I purchased this book as my son is interested in the Elephant man and similiar stories. When it arrived I sat and read it myself for a few hours. It is absorbing, full of pictures, and each person is given a short biography of their life and what they accomplished, suffered, and how they eventually died. The author does not view the persons as freaks, but as unfortunate victims of nature. Recommended"
5,great service,"The estimated date of delivery was 4 days, received it in 2. Haven't had a chance to use it yet,but having looked it over, believe it is going to work great. It is heavy, seems to be very wellbuilt. Now if I could only afford the fuel to pump with it.UPDATE ON MY REVIEW: I have now had the opportunity to use this pump, and was suprised as to howfast I pumped 5 gal. of diesel into my pickup on the side of the road. Works great, easy to pumpand I highly reccommend it."
4,Funny Book,"""Amber Brown is Not a Crayon"" is one of the funniest books I have ever read and maybe it could be for you too. In the book, Justin and Amber were best friends. All of a sudden, Justin is moving away and they get in a fight. They figure out that getting in a fight over a silly little move is very silly indeed."
5,A great strategy/RPG game !!!,"This is one of my favorite games ever! The charcters are great, the job system is wonderful, and the story, music, and graphics, everything is great! Everyone who is a fan of any strategy game especially Final Fantsy Tatics would love this game. Also, it is very easy to learn the battle system and the job system. I don't think it should have gotten the mature rating, the only reason for this is because when you kill somebody on the battle field all these red squares burst out. Buy this game, you won't regret it!"
5,Good RPG,I just got this game today and its in my top 3 favorite Video Games. This game is like FF Tacticts.It has different game play than most RPG's.This and FF7 are my two favorite RPG's.
5,Perfectly classy way to mess the with the Cubs fans at work...,"I bought this to hang in my office, both because it looks amazing and to mess with the Cubs fans I work with. It's made of really nice-looking wool and the stitching seems to be high quality. My only complaint would be that it came folded up, so it's got two pretty prominent creases in it."
5,Fantastic!,"My 3 1/2 year old loves, loves, loves Max and Ruby!! This is the first DVD we have been able to find (since the episodes now air at three a.m.!)The DVD is loaded with quite a few episodes-so she can get her Max and Ruby fix until the new DVD comes out in March...Such a sweet, wholesome show!Completely recommend."
5,This is such a cute series!,"I enjoy watching this show with my grandson. Ruby and Max are one of those shows that are done with childrens best interets in mind. Soft and cuddly, cute and playful, I highly recommend this dvd or any other of this series."
3,came early but wasnt in good condition,I got this actually early but the condition of it by no means was perfect.. I was going to give this as a gift but just going to give it to my son to watch during Christmas break
5,max& ruby christmas,"My daughter love max and ruby and she watches this tape over and over. Well worth the money and my daughter loves it. My six year old love max and ruby this is her favorite show on t.v. Her eyes light up when she got this dvd. This christmas dvd contains six episodes of max and ruby. The episodes are: Max's christmas, Ruby's snow queen, Max's rocket sun, Ruby's figure eight, Ruby's surprise party and Ruby's tent."
5,Mom of 3 boys,"My two oldest boys, ages 4 and 3, love Max and Ruby - I am sorry there are no other recent productions! The boys laugh out loud at this video - Max is very precocious and his facial expressions are adorable! I highly recommend this video for really good fun for young ones."
3,Disappointed,Our 4 year old daughter has a fascination with Ruby and Max that I don't quite understand but we ordered this for Christmas and she was quite thrilled until we watched it and discovered that the same Christmas episodes had just aired on TV. Since it was produced in 2005 I was hoping that it would be comprised of episodes my little girl had never seen before. But I was wrong.
5,Great movie,My grandson loves max and ruby and even though Christmas is over he keeps watching this movie over and over!
2,Dragon's Lair,"Great merchant; fast delivery. Only had 1 coleus and 2 dragon tree seeds come up, but they are doing well. Would like to have had a better germination rate. But I now use the dome as an indoor greenhouse to start seeds in peat pots. It works well for that."
3,Get something else,"I bought this for my brother for several reasons; he loves dragons, he loves gardens, and he loves interesting things. This item was suppose to fill all three. We were very disappointed. First, whenever the instructions mention 'save some seed aside for later as there will be a lot of plants,' don't listen. MOst of the plants didn't sprout and what did sprout was only one type of plant and we used all the seeds and there was plenty of room. Second, the entire 'greenhouse' isn't very durable and the lid kept flying off. I finally just taped it down to get it to stay. The end result. We have a tiny dragon inside a greenhouse that we can't see (because it's a wet green house). We hve one plant out of three growing and not very well at that. The kids are not interested in the entire project becuase they can't see anything and the tape is kind of putting htem off the enitre project."
2,No plants growing,"My son was so excited planting the seeds and arranging the stones, dragon, etc. He was disappointed when not one plant sprouted. Only very few seeds were given and there is not much to try again. We will plant our own seeds, but I had purchased this because it was all included in one set. Frustrating overall."
4,Lots of Fun to do with your child,"My son loved putting the terrarium together and loved and the dragon lore, lava rocks, etc. Only time will tell if it will grow anything but he enjoyed the process of putting it together. Great item for the winter when you can't go outside and plant."
4,D H Peligro,"If you have not heard his new stuff since the DK's then you are missing out. This is one disc that I just dont get tired of. It was stolen and I picked up another copy asap. Give it a listen, you won't be dissapointed. His other disc ""welcome to america"" and the earlier ""jungle studs"" (only available on vinyl, and oop) are also recomended. His new disc ""sum of our suroundings"" should also not be missed. Definately the best of the post DK efforts, not to mention the new versions of the DK classics. BUY THIS NOW. This is some fundamental punk rock that's CURRENT and not on MTV (get off the air!!!!!!!!)"
5,True Talent,This is a CD you'll never get tired of listening to. I've been a big fan of DH Peligro since his days with the Dead Kennedys and this CD is a fine piece of work.
3,Good CD,"Hey, I bought this CD cuz Peligro was the drummer for the Dead Kennedys BUT he doesn't play drums on this CD. He sings & plays guitar. I really enjoyed this disc. Very raw metal-ish punk with real emotion."
5,It rocks!,Fans of AVAIL will not be dissapointed with this newest record as it's just as rockin as Over The James or 4am Friday. These guys do melodic hardcore better than anyone!
4,Best indie pop release of 2006,"Faintest Ideas are yet another great indie pop band from Sweden. On their album ""What goes up must calm down"", they mix passionate vocals, dishorted guitars, and catchy choruses to create a jittery and upbeat brand of indie pop/c-86 type music. The faintest ideas remind me of the aislers set at their loudest (think red door) or a band like shop assistants only with male vocals. If you're looking for an indie pop release that isn't too cute and has some ""grit and muscle"" to it this cd is a must have for you. Highly Recommended and definitely bedroom dance worthy."
3,"Good guide, not a great guage.","Out in the field and checking for ADA compliance - turned out there were 4 of us, each with a handy dandy smart level. Not all the same brand, and not all the same readings. It became dueling smartlevels as we started making sure we picked the same spot exactly so we could test our respective levels. We hurriedly calibrated. No joy.A degree higher, a degree lower - might not make you think twice, but if you need to be 2% or less, and the reading is 2.1%, your screwed. - so I'd say it's a good guide, not a great guage."
2,Frustrating as a guidebook,"North Carolina is a great climbing destination with a rich tradition of routes - both bold multipitch trad ascents, as well as technical and pumpy sport routes. Yon Lambert does cover most (if not all) the major climbing areas, but falls short of making it easy for the climber to locate the right climbs. The problem is that unlike most rock climbing guidebooks, this one does not specify the individual climbs into ""Sport"", ""Trad"" and ""Mixed"" categories. It leaves the climb to the guesswork of the reader/climber. I'm a sport climber and don't possess any trad gear. This book makes it difficult for people like me to confidently start climbs where we may run into sections that need trad protection - dangerous when we aren't carrying any. However lack of other complete guidebooks for NC means that I do end up using this one a lot."
3,"They mean ""MINI"", very small","I didn't really look too hard into how small the item was, but it's actually very tiny. It's still cute to have on a key chain or something possibly or for collector reasons."
4,A pair of unforgettable lovers!,"Claire Butler was one of California's first women lawyers, carving out her place in the small mining town of Bodie. Johnny Christmas was her first client-a firefighter accused of brutalizing a local woman. Despite Johnny's reputation as a brawler and a carouser, Claire fiercely believed that he was innocent. And she would risk her career and her life to prove it. Torn between her honor and an angry lynch mob, the law-abiding counselor surprised even herself-when she helped her client excape to the mountains. Johnny and Claire rode into the wilderness, their desires fueled by the excitement of danger. In the cool darkness, they thrived on the fruit of the woods and streams-and the warmth of each other. There they were safe to live and love, in their own private Eden . . ."
4,Paradise revisited,"It's hard to find many video's that capture the island spirit of Hawaii as well as this. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the video is overall; and I enjoyed watching it. It's not something you'd watch every week, but it does serve as a nice video to sit down to every once in a while to rekindle the island feeling and memories. I'd recommend this to anyone who's got Aloha on the brain. I'm glad to have it in my collection."
5,RARE Making of Star Trek V,"I have to admit that I was originally disappointed with Star Trek V. Then after it hit home video it grew on me. Despite the worst Special Effects in the series and some jokes that were over the top it still had some good parts. I can see how it could have worked better. I have read everything else on this film but this book, so I want to find some time to read it.The book arrived in stated conditon and in a timely fashion. Thank you for the Starlog Magazine.Here's a link for a fan-edit that I have been waitng for:[...]"
2,Can't see numbers,"The set is a beautiful black, but the numbers are hard to read. Painting the numbers in white vs red would have been much better. Our Mah Jong club are people above 50, so sight is an issue."
3,Half Classic-Half filler,"As an intro to Peabo the first 8 songs are a must-have.But if you want the most complete,buy the anthology.If you want the cream-of-the-crop, buy the Super Hits.If you want the peak of his career get hisStraight From The Heart and duets with Roberta Flack.But this is an o.k. introduction."
2,Rob D,"The selections on this CD are great. The MAJOR problem is that the tracks are not in original stereo, but mostly in mono with some pseudo stereo effect on some tracks that causes the chorus (background) vocals to sound as if they are emanating from down a deep well! Quite surprising since this disc is manufactured by ""RHINO""! Select another Peabo disc! I am!"
2,Beware - this release is in MONO,"I'm surprised at Rhino for allowing this pressing to make it to the market - normally Rhino releases set the bar high. This recording was mastered in mono, not stereo, and channel separation/balance is off as well. I tossed my copy - no reason to keep. Bought it for a pitch corrected version of ""If Ever You're In My Arms Again"" but if it's in mono, what's the point. I have the original pressing of his 1984 album on CD, but that pressing is pitched up. Oh well."
5,Quick delivery!,The product arrived very quickly - and although it did not affect the CD; the case was cracked a bit. Perhaps a cardboard shipper would prevent this from happening? Love Peabo and the CD!! Thank you!
3,Not upto it's name.,"I have been wanting this set for a long time and now that i have it....well, the fragrance is very good but not long lasting."
4,Visit to a magical cave,"The images of the interior of the cave with its astonishing artwork are magical as presented in usually very effective 3D. A few of the interviews are useful and enlightening. Some of Herzog's own fanciful leaps, not so much. Fortunately, he stays out of the way most of the time and just lets us enjoy these cave paintings we're unlikely to ever see another way."
4,Herzog fan turned art fan.,"i have to come clean - i'm a huge Herzog fan. and i'm sure this clouds my review.BUT having said that, this movie blew me away.i must have spent 2 hours after watching this film (saw it in the theater) just hanging around a coffee shop trying to digest what i just saw.it totally made me reevaluate how i felt about culture, art and history. i'm no snob, in fact, i'm a total novice when it comes to art. i have no back round, very little appreciation for it, and never thought i would.but this movie really changed all that for me.i keep finding myself looking at the world in a completely new way.it's crazy.loved it. might be his best work, though it's tough to compare it to much else."
2,sleepy time,"This film is in 3D, one of few available. While some may find the subject matter interesting, it bored me to sleepiness."
3,Not HD.,"We ordered the hd version specifically, but there were parts that were almost unwatchable. The film itself was very good. Great documentary."
1,3d is bad,"I was anxious to get this 3D Blu Ray disk, and put it in the ps3 to view. First, there were several ads to get through before reaching the Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Rather annoying, but just keep skipping them. The movie started, and I turned on the 3D... the picture was totally confusing, and not at all 3D. After trying several 3D re-starts, I put in another 3D movie (Cars 2), and verified that my system was fine. I put Cave back in, and was again confronted with non-watchable scenes. I closed one eye, and saw a certain scene, however, closing the other eye gave me an entirely different scene, not a slightly different view of the same scene.I believe my disk is erroneously made. I can only hope mine is unique. I returned it to Amazon for a refund, and will wait to see other reviews before re-ordering."
2,Extremely boring,"I have recently gotten into home theatre 3D and started buying up as many titles that appeared to be fun or interesting to watch. Above all the movies,documentaries,and iMax releases, Cave of Forgotten Dreams was the worst one of them all. It was just plain BORING. All of the people on camera didn't even seem to be enjoying themselves and after you see the cave paintings in the first 10 minutes of the documentary, the rest was just a poor attempt to lengthen the film. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Cave of Forgotten Dreams,"What a strange movie! It started out as a factual documentary which I found absolutely fascinating especially since I had never heard of the cave before even though it's a relatively recent find. The drawings are wonderful to see! Then it turned very peculiar. It's even hard to describe. It's some kind of French new-age speculation about modern mankind connecting with prehistoric artists through these drawings which are ""actually"" dreams. Was interesting but not worth the money."
2,Cave of Forgotten Dreams [Blu-ray 3D],"I like 3D movies and I generally like documentaries and other themes, however, I cannot say I particularly enjoyed this movie. This movie is very dry and boring. Perhaps it is just me but I did not find this movie to be very good. Sorry but that's my opinion. Others may find it okay, but I seriously doubt it. My mom always said if you can't say anything nice; don't say anything at all - so pretend I didn't say anything. The seller performed very well and I would buy from this seller again."
2,too much ado about little,"This movie is good for maybe 10 minutes. The rest is just a rumbling essay on the beauty and importance of this finding, which I think is so corny and bordering on maudlin romanticism. This movie was shot in handheld cheap cameras converted to 3D and you could tell how shoody it was done. I love great discoveries, but this one was really stretching this one discovery too thinly over an hour an a half, most of it sepculative rather than factual I would say. I love documentaries but this is not even worth 5 bucks in my honest assessment."
4,no subtitles?,"I would love to buy this as I have heard wonderful comments about it,but without subtitles or closed-captions(there is a big difference for hearing-impaired people)I have to pass it by and hope that someday it will be re-released by a company that knows the value of subtitles and that share of the market that rely on them to enjoy film at home.Thank you,Tim JaquaBristol,VT"
2,"A fascinating subject, turned into an incredibly annoying doc by Herzog",Werner Herzog injects WAY to much Werner Herzog into this documentary. If he had just shut up and let the principals speak about this astonishing discovery - which really does count as one of the world's great works of art - this would be an engrossing documentary. My advice: turn the sound off (since the scientists all speak French so you can just follow along by reading the subtitles).
2,Disappointing,"Thought I was getting a movie about the exploration of a cave, but it is more about cave drawings found within a cave and the analyzing of what that would reveal about prehistoric man and animal... yet nothing scientific just ideas that scientists have though maybe could be. The cave formations were skimmed over to show the same drawings over and over again. It is a 90 min movie with 40mins of information just being repeated multiple times. My husband who never can sleep during any movies found it difficult to keep his eyes open and I felt I was back in history class. Some camera shots were pretty but many were grainy so it's not that I can brag about the view either. Might be good for those highly interested in the paleo era... but make sure that is what you are looking for before purchasing."
4,A cave that changes history as we know it.,The subject matter was very interesting and the photography was excellent. It was amazing to see all of the scientific effort that has gone into analysing the cave and the paintings. There was so much more than just seeing cave paintings.
4,Cool but drags,"As far as 3D is concerned: nothing is unbelievable. Most of the 3D images are repeated images of the same art work contained in the caves over, over, over and over again. After you have seen a run-through of the cave art for the first time, you have seen anything that is special about this long documentary. Not much changes throughout the entire film. Additionally, due to filming constraints, the camera can only get so close to the caves & their artwork. This limits what you can actually see.Would have been much more compelling had the film been shortened and the 3D pieces been used more effectively. Much of the time, you may have trouble correlating what the tour guides are referring or talking about to the actual filming and artwork.Nothing GREAT, but also nothing bad. Could have been shorter with more effective use of 3D (as in not showing the same pictures over and over and over again).Not bad."
3,should have waited for it on cable,"How is it that this supposedly well filmed documentary is so washed out and crappy? I was expecting eye-popping color and subtle tones in my Blu-Ray copy and what I got for $35.00 was ghastly contrasts and severe lack of rich color. Was this supposed to be B&W with scant highlights? And the music could have been SSOOO much better. I really appreciate being able to see the vicinity and the repeated view angles of the art were fine and interviews with those working at the site was interesting, but over-all I wish I had waited for it to come out on the History Channel. Thumbs down."
3,Limited Scale and Dry Pontifications Hurt a Promising Theme,"Werner Herzog is given intimate access to the earliest instance of cave painting known to modern man, the Chauvet Cave in southern France. It's a mesmerizing topic, but after the third or fourth time the screen pans dramatically across the same six sketches, it's clear that elaboration just isn't in the cards. Rather than using these caves as a jumping-off point to discuss early man and his habit of cave painting in general, Herzog stands in place and explores the particulars of these specific illustrations. Which is his prerogative, granted, and fully excusable if he's able to find enough meat to justify the narrow perspective. Ultimately he doesn't, though, and his long, dull conversations with the local team of researchers only further belabor a struggling theme. Dry and emotionless as a textbook with just one or two moments of wonder, it's too much for a TV episode and too little for a feature-length documentary."
3,Disappointed,"Chauvet cave is my favorite of the painted caves, so I was truly looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, there was absolutely nothing in this film I hadn't seen or heard before in terms of the paintings. The narration didn't go deep enough to be an introduction to painted caves, nor was it scientific enough to satisfy a person with a particular interest in Chauvet.And the musical score...I see in the reviews that many people were enthralled by the score. I found it horribly over-dramatic, discordant, and outdated in style and production, as though composed in the 1980's."
2,Loud Music...,"The cave is amazing and so the paintings. The paintings are so alive that you can look at the eyes of the animals and it is like they are looking at you. Herzog has his own style. It worked for his other productions but not for this one. Nothing worst than having a loud music when the narrator talking. To me it is so stupid when they have music so loud when infact if you would walk in the cave there would be no noise at all less alone Herzog's voice and a loud music. I do not watch documentary for drama, I watch to learn facts so I need to hear the narrator not the music. Herzog's accent and voice was good for the bears in Alaska not for this cave. The cave and paintings are a must see. I highly recommend watching this since it is the only way to see the cave but knowing that Herzog's style, voice and that loud music are irritants not compliments."
2,Very cool... for 10 minutes,"Fascinating discovery and exploration of caves with ancient drawing that really are remarkable. But much of the 3d camera usage was dizzying to watch (camera on shoulders walking through the forest) and the movie became extremely repetitive, showing the same drawings over and over. Kudos to the brave explorers who made this important discovery, but don't plan on sitting through the whole movie and being captivated."
2,Disappointed,"Maybe it's just me, but I found this a bit boring after about 20 minutes. I also seemed to have a bit of trouble with the 3d aspectoff the dvd. It would show it in 3d then stop being in 3d . then you would get a message along the bottom of the screen saying it has detected a 3d signal and to push the 3d button. I basically did that for the next 45 minutes turning the glasses off and on as welll . I am hoping that this was just a dvd problem and not my new tv or dvd player. Also I found the background music hard to take"
3,Solid,"Why Herzog deemed it prudent to film this in 3D is something of a mystery. One supposes he wanted to try and make the paintings, not on flat surfaces, come alive, and maybe they do, in 3D, but in 2D it does nothing. Worse, this film really does nothing. There is nothing essentially Herzogian in it. It's a documentary any filmmaker could do for a cable channel, save for the pointless Postscript to the film, involving albino alligators and mystic mumbo jumbo Herzog finds profound.The film, at 89 minutes, is probably an hour too long, and while interesting cinematography, by Peter Zeitlinger,, and a nice soundtrack by Ernst Reijseger, enliven the film, they can only do so much. Herzog's narration is not what it is in earlier documentaries of high quality, and one sense the filmmaker gets bored with it all about halfway through the film. Nonetheless, it's a tossup as to which of the two documentaries, here under review is worse. This one is not good, but not bad, merely dull."
3,"Great movie, viewing issues Amazon problem","Excellent movie. Great video...must see once. Narration was a bit lengthy and monotonous.Amazon kept buffering and the movie would pause due to high traffic. I will never stream from them again. I double checked my PC system, windows 7, dual core processor, 8G RAM, running programs etc.and I also ran internet speed test (cable high speed internet). All was fine but the movie kept pausing and buffering for 2-3 min. even with popout player. Very annoying."
4,More 'Herzog' than 'anthropology' - and I loved it!,"It starts out like a normal documentary ... but as it proceeds, it becomes more and more fixated on Herzog's OWN dreams. You'll wonder ""why is he so fixated on those horses"", and you'll find yourself watching a scene about albino crocodiles and the evils of nuclear energy.Magically, this ""Documentary"" becomes even more myopic and introspective than even ""Heart of Glass"", in which the actors were hypnotized at the start of each filming day. If you consider Herzog to be one of our most talented and unique film artists, as I do, then YOU MUST BUY THIS BLU-RAY. But if you didn't like 'Grizzly Man', then stay away - this film is even more extreme."
1,Not worth it,"The scientific story is nice, but the 3D quality and its worthiness are of bottom quality and really a lot less than average... keeping in mind that one would want to keep watching a 3D movie again and again mainly because of its feel and visual effects, this movie really has none of such qualities."
4,Great for Historical Information,"Herzog does it again! This film is beautifully made, artistically shot and chock-full of new information. I enjoyed it greatly."
4,Cave of Forgotten Dreams,"The oldest stories of all, the stories of animals on the move, animals fighting, animals reproducing, animals just being beautiful and fascinating, were depicted on the walls of French caves by artists so long ago that we don't even know what their spoken language was like, let alone their own appearance. In this spectacular documentary, we see the best of what scientists were able to capture on video, and we hear the stories of their rediscovery after 28,000 years, and modern attempts to preserve them by limiting access. I found it visually fascinating, but I wish it were available without the intrusive musical soundtrack, which at times overpowers the spoken narrative."
3,Wesley Willis up side yo' head,"With tunes such as ""Rock and Roll McDonalds"" and ""Jesus is the Answer,"" Wesley Willis reminds listeners just exactly how fun it can be to have a mental handicap. Buy one cd; however, don't buy any more that one. All the music is the same. (The result of a pre-programmed Casio keyboard) The lyrics are brutally honest but somewhat repetitive. Actually, they are extremely repetitive. Wesley Willis is a novelty - fun to hear but chances are his cd will find it's way to the back of your cd case and come out only when you need to entertain a friend. I don't understand why people post reviews making such claims such as ""WESLEY WILLIS IS A GENIUS."" He is not a genius...."
1,Bad music to the max,"Just kidding!! This should be 5.1223183 stars! Wesley is one of a kind. Don't listen to anyone who gave this a low rating. They obviously take music and their lives too seriously. You know, like the type of people that see a movie and pay too much attention to details and say they ""don't get it"". I find that when I meet someone if they know who Wesley Willis is, and can sing at least one of his songs they are a good person. Oh and go see him live if you get a chance. Don't forget to bump foreheads with him. He will love you...to the max. We love you Wesley!!!"
2,"Second verse, same as the first","...and third and fourth and so on. Sure, Willis is funny the first time, but every time? No. Each song is the same as the last, except for the subject. Just listen to one, substitute the name of your favorite band, fast food joint or serial killer, and you've heard them all."
2,A Genius?,"Wesley Willis may be a genius, but I wouldn't say his music makes him one. Possibly pushing himself from the depths of homelessness and mental illness to semi-stardom may qualify him as one, although he probably didn't do it on his own. Listening to such ""breakthrough"" music such as ""Rock & Roll McDonalds"" and the whiny ballad ""I wupped Batman's ass"" may get a few good laughs, though listening to his songs for over 20 minutes will make any real song sound like a masterpiece. Wprth a listen or two, but too much listening could cause damage to your psyche."
5,F###ing Banana's,I don't even know where to start with this guy. Wesley is a genius and an idiot. Please enjoy responsibly.
5,HILARIOUS!!,"Wesley always has me rolling on the floor with the kind of random off-the-wall humorous rants found only in his tunes! It's too bad he had a rough life, though. It just goes to show that you don't have to be well-known to have some of the best talent! Definite must-have! Oh yeah, and props to Johnny Bottom on his Willis-styled biography of the man lol"
2,Maybe I don't understand.,"What I hear when I listen to this is a person who has trouble with tuning and probably doesn't write any of the background music to what they are singing to. I'm sure there is an artistic message to it, some sort of avant-garde message beneath the notes, but I don't hear it. This should not be marketed as music, but abstract art. Van Gough would sound really weird on record. But that didn't stop this fellow. I don't find any musical merit in the tunes, no phrasing talent, no tonal or technical ingenuity. But that's just my opinion. I thought that I'd express it. All I'm saying is that this is not music, this is some sort of art, and should not be placed in the same category as the millions of musicians who strive against one another each day in strife through a market ruled by flights of fancy of people who never suffered a day in thier life."
2,its quite sick and twisted,"As all the musical prodigies who have reviewed this man's albums can attest too, his ability to create music is beyond that of your average musician. Listen to his music, listen to it a lot. Once you feel as if you can't take anymore of it then go put on some Nasum and go run off of a cliff into a pool of acid. It'll feel better then listening to this stuff and reduce the number of people whose musical taste is ruined beyond all hopes of repair."
5,very Creative cat,"I enjoyed this Brother's approach to Music Making.Rock&Roll Mcdonalds is Classic.I enjoy the Simplicity,but also the challenge in his writing. He was from chicago&I would have dug if he had have gotten a chance to work with R.kelly on a Project because I believe they could have done something truly incredible.I enjoyed the Humor,Entertainment&overall message in his Music.He is a Artist who got what Creativity is all about without trying to be all over the top about it.Props&RIP to His Creativity."
5,Stew in the Garbage Can,"If your ever out in the OLD WEST and you don't have a pot, a good ole GARBAGE CAN will do!"
1,Never buy a Sony Laptop,"Never ever a buy a Sony Laptop. They provide you a a CD-RW for FREEEEEEEEEE!! The trick behind is that they don't need to provide you a recovery CD.What all you get in the box is the trash AOL CD!!They have a program that will create 10 coasters in order to recover the applications and OS!!I will never ever rely on this!!So, please stay away!! That is billion dollar advice I can give."
2,PCG-FRV 26 CD-RW/DVD drive is absolutely flimsy,I agree with the comment placed by Via Con Dios. This CD-RW/DVD drive on this PCG-FRV 26 laptop is absolutely flimsy.May I ask if this CD-RW/DVD drive is supported by Sony? It is my impression that it isn't.This computer is brand new and this CD-RW/DVD drive has already started acting up. 9 out of times it does NOT open. Just for info - my computer is not on standby or hibernate.It is too much of a pain to send it back and forth to Sony. I'd rather get an external DVD drive and move on.I'd strongly recommend to Amazon: Please do NOT sell any more of this version of Vaio.
2,I'm sure there's better out there,"I have had mine for a couple of years. Strange, but my Sony camera and this laptop aren't compatible. Each time I would try to viev a movie from my camera, the laptop would shut down. Sony said it's a Microsoft problem and Microsoft said it's a Sony problem. I got with Sony tech support. They had me erase all my programs and start all over again as if it was a brand new laptop. While on the phone talking to them, the dvd player broke. They immediately had me send the laptop to them. They repaired the dvd and said I didn't have to erase my programs after all. I started the computer and on the first try, the computer shut down again. I told them it still doesn't work properly. That's as far as it went. If I would have known I was going to have this much trouble with the laptop and support, I would of purchased a different brand."
1,Sony stinks,"I purchased a Sony GRX500 as a graduating present for my daughter. Initially, it was fine but started to fail after the warranty ran out (of course). This seems to be a manufacturing flaw, ... There are hundreds of people complaining about the same symptoms (does not boot, fails). The real disappointment is Sony's reaction to this: we have never seen this before (a lie) and it will cost you $700.- for a new motherboard. I will not purchase any Sony products in the future in general and would recommend Dell for laptops - their service is good."
1,Sony Sucks,"BEWARE of Sony VAIO Laptops, you can never upgrade them to newer operating systems that MicroSoft releases every year. If you try upgrading them, the laptops lose out on functionality and SONY recommends you buy a newer laptop!!! Here is what they had to say in one of their emails -NOTE: SONY does not recommend or support an upgrade path to Microsoft's Windows XP Professional operating system for VAIO PCs originally shipped with the Windows 95/98/98SE or ME environment. Currently Windows XP Professional upgrades are only supported for systems pre-installed with Windows 2000 Professional or XP Home Editions. Both Microsoft and SONY do not support an upgrade from Windows 2000 Professional to Windows XP Home Edition."
3,"ABRIDGED Translation, not complete","WARNING -- this translation has been abridged, without either translator or editor acknowledging it. Chunks of the German original are simply omitted. Why is it legal to do this (it is certainly not ethical)? Someone ought to let the German publisher (DTV) or the estate of Keun know. If you want the entire book, go look for Basil Creighton's older translation. This translation is very readable and lively; pity it isn't complete."
5,La salsa mas sabrosa!,"Todos los exitos de Luis Felipe Gonzalez fueron, son y seguiran siendo la salsa mas sabrosa para bailar, para escuchar, para enamorar y compartir.... Siempre he buscado sus temas y cuesta trabajo reunirlos todos en un solo Cd, aqui en este se alcanza el proposito... son un tesoro maravilloso!"
1,Very disappointing.,"Unbelievable and inconsistent characterizations and storyline, florid & tired phraseology, [sex] thrown in once in a while ""for interest""? Some good dog show/breeding details not enough to offset the awful soap opera characters and stupid story."
5,Whoa! Shocked by the poor reviews!!!,"I am seriously shocked by the poor reviews for this printer!! I have had this printer since 2004/2005 and have had absolutely NO problems with this printer! It is an excellent printer, scanner and copier. I haven't had any issues whatsoever. This all-in-one prints and scans photos and documents beautifully, quickly, and I feel as if I never replace the ink! If I run out of ink, I am able to purchase a refill for far less than it would cost for a new cartridge. After having it all of these years, it is still as functional and durable as the day I bought it. I have another printer, an Epson, that my boyfriend bought 6 months ago and we have had nothing but problems with it! We would have been better with a second HP C3150 and I highly recommend this product!!"
1,Worst Printer EVER,"I have owned this printer for about 8 years and I can say hands down it is the worst printer I've ever used. I've had NOTHING but problems with it. The paper doesn't feed correctly, either not being able to pull sheets and saying that it's out of paper, or pulling multiple sheets at the same time, I've had some print jobs come out on 4 pieces of paper.Also every time I try to plug it in after not using it for awhile, or getting a new computer it's a HUGE hassle of downloading drivers and updates and crap. This last time I tried using it after unpacking after a move, I even had the original installation CD and it's now saying it won't work because I'm using a Windows XP 64 bit operating system. Say what!? I'm using Windows 7...I'm just so fed up with it, and after a couple punches my fist hurts and I'm looking to buy a new one, probably a Canon or Epson."
1,Canoe by Dana for Men/Cologne 8 oz,"I had purchased two bottles of the product because it is not always available in stores, plus the price was very good. However, clearly the product was old and the scent had ""turned bad""-almost rancid. First indication was that the color was ""off"" (very dark) and then I smelled it. Whew! Threw both bottles away."
4,Another Wacky Summers Story,"I have to smile whenever I read a story by this author. Each one has an incredible sense of home-comfort that I never find anywhere else. Jonathan and Camilla are bewildered by each other's actions that don't make sense, but you know their life will be wonderful and happy once they can get past their mix-ups. What I enjoy most is the sense that their romance will last forever, because they have gotten rid of their pride and care more about each other than about themselves."
5,The best JFK doc out there...,"... and the first one to put the blame where it truly belongs. I've known that Bush 41 was behind it for 11 years now so I'm glad to see someone has finally put the pieces together for all to see. Hankey is right: The Hoover memo is a smoking gun and so is Bush's habit of naming planes and ships after his wife. Maybe not enough to convict a president of killing a president, but it would be enough to bring the case to trial and get a real investigation if the entire system weren't controlled by Nazis."
5,Excellent Documentary!,Follow the logic the conclusion is clear. The JFK assination was an inside job directed by none other tha GHW Bush.
1,More Nuts Than Planters,"Let me say up front that I am an avid reader of JFK conspiracy theories and believe that anyone who is not cognitively impaired and has studied the case would not accept Oswald as the lone assassin from his supposed position in the TSBD.This DVD argues that George H.W. Bush was connected to the JFK plot, with very little hard evidence. If he was briefed by the FBI on the case, that's hardly a smoking gun.The information in this DVD is widely available elsewhere, but its still not convincing in any context."
1,Utter Garbage,"I am 100% pro-conspiracy in the JFK case and know a thing or two about it. I have researched the case for years and read many, many books and documents such as Dallas Police, FBI, CIA files, the HSCA and Warren Commission investigations etc. To educate yourself about this incredibly complicated case will take you a lifetime. It will also teach you that there are too many people in this world who claim to have ""evidence"" and a ""solution to the case"". This DVD is poorly-researched and made. It is insulting, pathetic, amateurish, high-school standard trash.Stay off the weed pal and stick to conspiracy theories more up your street. Perhaps something like milk gives you cancer or the challenger disaster was faked !"
2,Smells & Tastes FUNKY!,"It may work, won't know until I see the dentist again, but I do know that it smells strongly like a root cellar when brushing."
5,A must have for your Ziggy collection,This book is wonderful! A must have for any true Ziggy collector. The book displays so many items that I have never seen before. Now I am able to search for these new items and hopefully make my collection as great as the one in the book.
5,Rodney Gets All the Chicks!,Rodney helped get me into punk. Forever I am grateful. This is one CD I will pass on to my son! How come when I see Rodney out on the town he always has 4-5 girls with him?
3,"Good Sunglasses, But Not For Me","From the picture online, I thought these sunglasses looked cool and sleek. When I got them I was surprised at how big they were. They were really too big for my liking. Also, I thought the interchangeable lenses, though cool, were a little flimsy. It didn't really seem like they were terribly sturdy at all. But then again, I returned mine right away, so I am not sure how they would have held up over time."
1,This book had a thin plot.,"This book had a very thin plot. You pretty much always knew what was going to happen next. Some people may like this book, and others may not. I didn't like this book."
5,A touching story of a child dealing with death,"I'm a little puzzled by two negative entries in the review section for this book. The one by the second grade class seems to have missed the particular theme of this book and the second claims the story is predictable. Well, in a way, it is predictable. The grandmother's death is an inevitable event, and dealing with that death and loss is a story every child must deal with in their lives. The young girl in this book reacts with horror to the thought of losing her grandmother--and even tries to fight it--keep it from happening. In the end, she comes to an understanding and an acceptance of what death means and finds new strength for herself and her family. This is a wonderful book for those children who are dealing with the question of death in their own lives."
4,A Kid's Review,"I think this book is great because you learn a lesson that it is okay to feel sad when someone dies. This book is good for Native Americans and for people that are studying them. The pictures are also really nice. The best part of the story is when Annie puts her teacher's shoe in the garbage. The worst part of the story is when Annie learns her grandmother is going to die. I liked the ending because Annie figured out that people have to die. She stops being bad in class and learns a lesson.Jesse, Second Grade, 05-06"
1,Can not compare to the original scent,I love Elizabeth Arden's Green tea line of products and was excited to try the Summer scent. I was very disappointed with the scent. I am not sure exactly what the fragrance is but the crisp light smell of the original is lost with the added fragrance which smells very artificial . I have never had any one tell me I smelled good while wearing the summer scent which frequently happens when wearing the original scent. Be sure to try before buying.
3,Excellent and supports Vista 64-bit,"Soundforge is excellent - I use it for LP/tape restoration as well as for mastering. The only major issue I have is that v9.0c will not install on Vista 64-bit.-Update 2/24/08-Version v9.0e installs fine now on Vista 64-bit and it is working fine with SP1. Overall, I appreciate Sony's schedule of frequenty releasing minor updates! At least 4 stars..."
1,Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 9.0,"Although Sound Forge Audio Studio 9.0d does the fancy things other reviews mention, I simply wanted it to transfer old LPs to MP3. There is a tool in the software called ""Vinyl Recording and Restoration"" that sounded perfect. It does work, but fails to recognize individual tracks on an LP, forcing you to identify these manually from the graphs and put in breaks.This was disappointing, but even more disappointing is Sony's complete lack of technical support. I sent a request for help on July 23, 2011 and followed up a week later but still have never received a response. The only suggestions supplied by auto-response are to locate and tracks manually.This is unacceptable to me, particularly when better software like Magix Audio Cleaning software exists."
3,the three stars for unclearity of these types of products(ever),"Although this has some fancy bells and whistles, it seems, it does not indicate wheather you can grapht your own voice overs onto all of theses ""professionally edited"" recordings. ALso in some audio phyle's cases the voice mic use in a quality manner, is the ONLY purpose of this software, as microsoft's own media is of terrible quality. You need a mixer and quality mic recording software, the mixer needs to be user freindly(at least resonably so) and not go through uncessisary complicated steps to be utilize fully, the mixer and VO device are what make all this stuff work for the purpose of art and production of your own, and if sound software doesn't have these capablitiies, it's only an over priced karioke machine, and totally useless in my opinion!"
5,MUSIC LIKE YOUR MOM WARNED YOU ABOUT,"Zeni Geva are one of the heaviest bands to have existed in ANY country, although for some reason I think their disjointed tracks, full of brutally heavy powerchords and bizarre psychedelic interludes, could have only come from a country as psychotic as Japan.HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended. Download samples of their tracks, and see if they don't burn your speakers."
4,AMERICAN GOTHIC,"This is the world of mobile homes, bad marriages and aging barflies. M. Gira's (Jarboe, Swans) solo project puts an electronic noise factor in Tom Waits-like ballads that collectively ask whether to pop open another beer or go meet the maker. It may be easy enough for Gira to plop a talk track on top of the opening, ""You See Through Me"", but the conversation from a young redneck couple about money and mothers-in-law becomes candid and frightening, like your eavesdropping on your best friends. The closing track, ""Blind"", is a lingering, soulful, folk delight of self-awareness and pride. The rest of it may sound like somebody kicking empty beer cans around, but snap open a new one and listen. Gira has something to say."
1,sandpaper salts,"If you like your bath salts to dissolve in the water don't buy this salt. I used it once and am throwing the rest of it away. It never dissolved, half of it floated around the tub in hideous white globs and the rest sank to the bottom and acted like sandpaper to whatever part of my skin touched the tub. I do not recommend this product."
5,yawn? huh??,"... this stuff is GOOD. It does have a weird New Age feel but the music is really beautiful and much (gasp!) funkier than the last outing. Incredibly complex dual guitars, spacey keyboards, sonic drums and the funky bass lines are all equally important ingredients in the ultimate masterpiece that is 'Dream Signals in Full Circles'. It makes it even more interesting to think that these dudes used to play in hardcore bands like The Locust, Crimson Curse, Constantine Sankathi, etc.This isn't genre-breaking, pioneering stuff but it's beautiful nonetheless and that should be enough."
4,Warm and beautiful,"This album almost gets 5 stars from me. Whenever I'm feeling like I need something thats soothing but not boring, Tristeza goes into my cd player. It loses one star for bordering on New Age [STUFF] at times. But, the key word is bordering, it never descends into mediocrity. I can't wait for their next album."
4,Feels Like Sitting By Yourself in a Canyon,"Beautiful, mellow grooves. This is intense concentration music or background music, though. Won't go over well at a party. I can't listen to it all the time, but that's probably because instrumental rock sometimes turns me off. I don't have a lot of instrumental know-how, so I'll make some faulty comparisons: prettier, less menacing than Godspeed You Black Emperor, less metal than Don Caballero (though I haven't heard their new stuff, which I hear isn't as hard).Beautiful hooks, interesting sounds. Good stuff, sparky. If you like other Trizteza or I-Rock in general, do yourself the favor of a copy."
2,Good content but not as advertised,"The book is well written and offers some nostalgia for former Everquest players or anyone who is interested in the early days of the MMORPG. I would give it a much higher review except for the construction of the book. The back cover displays ""full color game art section inside"". There may have originally been a color section but this book as it is printed now is all black and white."
3,"Fun reading, but overall weak development","Got quite a kick out of seeing the Inns and lands of Everquest made into a story. Would love to see more stories. The writing was somewhat stiff; grammatically in error just enough to be a bit of a pain. Seems like a few words were just looked up in a dictionary for variety - but incorrectly applied in context.Women characters, a good guideline for fantasy writing calibre, were boringly stereotyped - either weak, pale nothings or horrible vamps. Kind of funny, it was so bad.Plot - High points for this - I thought the ending was well done, wrapped up nicely with just a bit of a surprise. Overall, worth an afternoon just to see Qeynos again."
3,Pretty Much Old Trailers,"This three dvd boxset contains heaps of old trailers from the 30's to the early 70's and the quality is not bad, however the only downside I found with it was most of these trailers have been overshown over the years and there are really no surprises here nor really outstanding ones.These trailers look like they were just thrown in at random, still if this kind of stuff grabs you, grab it.The extra features are a couple of old radio show highlights and an interview."
4,Critique in context,"Buy this album. If you enjoy different kinds of modern worship music, buy this album. Other less-than-enthusiastic reviewers have neglected to point out that this music was performed during the Purpose Driven Life simulcast that thousands of churches participated in across the country when Rick Warren's book first appeared. Those performances were solid. Pay special attention to ""My Soul In Your Hands"" (powerful vocals) and ""Reach One More for Jesus"" (powerful message, especially if you've read the book and know where how the phrase relates to Rick Warren's father)."
1,The nocturnes of Chopin,"If you strongly dislike the music on this CD and prefer Chopin's nocturnes instead (or even Led Zeppelin), then read Russell David Harper's BALD. It's a good anodyne to purpose-driven mediocrity, and an example of a true search for meaning."
1,Junk - Didn't Last (4) Months,"This tarp is junk. I had it on my mini buggy in the back yard for not even four (Summer) months, untouched. When I went to remove it, I could see light through it in several places. Don't waste your money, this ~$70 purchase isn't worth it."
3,Not Really Practical,"These cards could be 100x better with one simple fix - if the reverse side of the cards were printed right-side up. We got these cards KNOWING that they were printed like that but figured it wouldn't be that big of an issue (my husband and I are learning Japanese together). BIG mistake. It is an issue. Even when you are practicing by yourself it is not practical. You forget that it's printed like that, then go to flip it, and end up having to rotate it to look at it right-side up. Plus you can completely forget about practicing with someone else. If you show them the kana, then they say what they think it is, then you have to rotate the card to see if that was correct, which in turn rotates the kana on the front that they are looking at.... It can completely confuse someone who is just learning. The only reason I gave this product 3 stars is because the information on them is correct, and it was the only kana flash card set I could find."
2,Hard to use product,"My kids don't have the strenght to hold the button down and brush their teeth at the same time. It's difficult for me, too.Otherwise, the toothbrush works. No problems charging and the head spins fine.I would avoid this unless they make it able to turn on and off. If the button is supposed to turn on/off, then it has never worked right."
3,Husband: Michael,"This is a correction to the blurb about this title. I believe the name of Jane Maas' husband is Michael (see co-author, Michael Maas as well as the book she wrote on advertising in 1986 ""Adventures of an Advertising Woman""). Peter is the name of Michael's brother."
4,Perfect,"I purchased this for my son's play room. Some of his toy shelves are hard for him to reach. This product requires assembly, but comes with very detailed instructions and the parts are packages nicely. I had no trouble assembling this product and it meets my needs.I don't know that I would recommend it for the bathroom though. The surface would be slippery when wet and could pose a potential falling hazard. You could probably add a few pieces of grip to it fairly easily though."
2,Attractive yet flimsy,"Very nice-looking but even when carefully assembled, it was a little crooked. Then the bottom step cracked within a week of using. Garbage."
1,Poorly Made Product!,"This step stool was incredibly frustrating to assemble. It embodies all that is wrong with cheap goods made in China. Several of the holes were not drilled properly, and it took me at least an hour, on two separate occasions, to ultimately get only 3 of the 4 final screws to sync up.In the process of trying to get this product functional, I had to have the company send me 2 new parts. Although courteous and helpful, the good customer service just doesn't compensate for a poorly manufactured, particle-board product.Spare yourself all the frustration you will encounter trying to get this thing together and spend a little more money on a higher quality product!"
4,Nice stool,"I really like this stool. The only thing wrong is that we use it in the bathroom and if it gets wet it can be slippery. Also, I got the dark blue color thinking it wouldn't show much dirt as compared to a white stool, however, it shows water drops and other dust."
4,Sturdy Stool for wiggly toddler,"I was looking for a taller stool then those sold at stores like Target/Walmart as they were too short. Everytime my daughter used one of those she would hit her chin on the countertop, so I needed something taller.This stool was perfect! it was at least 6 inches taller then other ones offered in ty hthe store and a lot more sturdy. It is pretty heavy to pick up, she is not able to lift it herself which I didn't like at first. But now I am glad it is heavier as it will not tip over and she is not able to move it all over the place like the other smaller plastic ones.It came in pieces so small assembly is required. We only put paper and a small book in the storage since we use it in the bathroom, but it is large enough to keep other items in there. The drawer does not slam down so you don't have to worry about it slamming on little fingers.Overall this is a great stool, great construction, heavy and sturdy!"
3,"not perfect, but a great solution compared to plastic stools","We tried the cheap plastic bathroom stools like Spongebob, bjorn, etc. They are too light, too narrow, and too short.The KidKraft is heavy so it doesn't get knocked out of place. It is quite sturdy. It is much higher than the cheap plastic stools so a toddler can actually comfortably reach the toilet AND the sink taps.There are two problems with the Step N Store, but we could work around those problems whereas we could not work around the problems with the cheap plastic stools. The KidKraft's painted surfaces can be slippery especially if the child wears socks in the house. We put a non-slip film or rubber on ours. We put the non-slip rubber on the feet too because the stool can also slip on smooth floors. Also the KidKraft manufacturing is quite poor and we had to improvise with one screw hole that was not drilled properly. But the stool has done the perfect job for us ever since."
4,heavy!,"We purchased two of these about 2 years ago- one for the bathroom for our little one to brush his teeth and one for the kitchen for him to help mommy cook. This stool is pretty heavy-think of it as a piece of furniture. My then ""little one"" is a rough houser and the bottom step is cracked now on both of them.... other then that...it is functional. Also...it is on the large side if you have small bathrooms be prepared for stubbed toes! Although, I do have one outside now so that he can reach the mailbox and get the mail or send letters to his friends...and it weathers well! But if I need another stool for my nine month old...I may get a folding one."
1,poor quality,"I really loved that this matched my son's captain bed and furniture, but it chipped right away. Bummer, it was really cute."
4,Just one thing missing...,We've got a couple of kid-craft products and found them very durable with good construction. The only frustrating thing is that on this step stool there was a dud bolt in the kit. We got another from a hardware store that does the job but doesn't match completely...would be nice if they focussed a little more on quality control. (Note: other item was table and chairs. On these the drill holes were not well lined up well making it difficult to put together).
3,Okay stool,"I just bought this step stool for my [...] old daughter. I was disappointed when I ordered it that it does not come already assembled. I was even more upset when I was trying to put it together and it took forever. It was not the easiest thing to put together.My daughter loves using it, and it is light enough that she can move it.One thing I do wish is that it had come with rubber pads on the bottom, which would be good if you have wood floors like I do. I have tried buying adhesive rubber pads, and they fall off within minutes."
4,not bad,the only thing I wish this came with is:* a non-slip top* a non-slip bottomthis is in our kiddos bathroom and little wet feet on a tile floor & slick wood don't jive.I'm going to get some rubber non-skid bumpers for the bottom and some anti-skid strips for the top.
1,dissatisfied,I have put together many things in my life but this was by far the most complicated. I would never purchase another one of these.
1,flimsy and dangerous - don't buy,"The wood developed small cracks around some of the bolt holes as we assembled it - and I am certain we did not overtighten the bolts. I figured it might work with some wood glue and extra screws, but then my four-year-old stepped on it and it cracked further, beyond repair.Also, as other reviewers noted, this is slippery. It will slide all over the floor if you don't put rubber tips on the bottom, and the step itself is a bit slippery for a child in socks.This is just an awful product. I wanted a heavier stepstool that my toddler couldn't tip over, but our lightweight plastic Rubbermaid stool is far safer than this one. The Baby Bjorn is a little small, but also a safer choice because of the rubber grips on top and bottom.Once again, though, Amazon comes through - since the product is defective, at least I don't have to pay to return it."
1,Try again,You need to assemble this- I should have read that before. After I did that- my 30 lbs. 2 and a half year old stepped on it and it collapsed. Maybe I did not assemble it right- but I think it did. The color was great- but I sent it back for the defect.
1,Not a good product,The pieces do not fit with each other. Not a quality product. We ordered a month ago and no longer use.
2,Meh,"Holes are poorly drilled and at least two screws were unusable (and, as a veteran of many Ikea pieces, I can assure you it was not user error). The result was an hour and a half of loud cursing followed by a semi-wobbly stool. Avoid this one"
1,HORRIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had not read reviews and did not realize it was unassembled. I am fairly handy, and had to walk away from the stool during assembly numerous times over a few days, I was so frustrated. Nothing lined up properly, and once I got it together, it was totally off balance. Throwing this in the TRASH."
2,Step N Store,The picture is decieving. Thought we were getting a larger product that actually stored a great deal of stuff. This was not the case.
2,Wow. What a piece of garbage!,"My wife added this to a wish list for our 2 year old, so she could reach the sink to brush her teeth. What a shoddy piece of garbage!-The lid was warped-The wood pieces aren't necessarily true-The holes bored in it don't help the situation.All in all, when the stool is put together, the lid is crooked and the pieces don't fit snugly. Do yourself a favor and buy something other than a Kidcraft product."
2,Not quite tall enough for a 2.5 yr old tall kid,"Less than 12 inches in height. Doesn't add much. Storage compartment more of a finger amputation risk than anything useful. Recommend something taller. And skids. So I had to put sticky pads to keep it from sliding on our hardwood floor. Overall, disappointed."
3,Too short!,"I bought this stool to replace another white kids step stool that had broken. I failed to read the dimensions (my fault, I know), but this stool is WAY shorter, by about 6 inches, than the typical two step stool. It's about the height of a standard one step stool. The difference is tat my 22 month old could stand on the old stool to reach the sink and with this one, only her nose reaches the counter. DEFINITELY read the dimensions before ordering this stool."
2,Kid freindly?,"Besides being a pain to assemble, this is not kid friendly! We bought this so our child could use it reach the sink to brush teeth and wash his hands. But the steps are very slick and the it slides on tile very easily (had to add rubber feet and grip tape to make it safe)!"
2,Missing Part,"I received my stool today, and immediately noticed that part #5 was missing. It's a large wooden board, I can't imagine how it didn't make it into the box. KidKraft does have great customer service and is replacing the part, but I'd rather have had it in the box in the first place. Irritating."
5,Very sturdy!,"This stool is sturdy and provides plenty of room for little feet (or big feet). It looks really nice too! Haven't used the storage area, but it's nice to know it's there if we need it. I decorated the top step with sports decals--an easy and quick design that adds a little spice. I recommend this product."
5,bed step stool,This stool does exactly what I wanted - a step up into my high bed. It assembled easily and looks exactly like the pic AND I received it 1 day after I purchased it.
2,Bought this Onkyo to pair up with my new Direct H20 HD dvr,"I have been disappointed by this receiver. Nothing but probems from the first day. Its set up in my bedroom so I have it hooked up as a 2.1 (2 front and 1 subwoofer). When you turn on the unit you hear hissing noises out of the speakers. It drives you bananas especially when its not getting a signal. Secondly everytime I have a channel or when the broadcast goes from HD to SD, I head a low frequency thump. Even with the volume turned down its prononced. And before I get any replies about checking for cross wires, the input signal is coax and the wires for the speaker hookup is clean, no crossing. And LAST straw, the center speaker started going berserk, static noise cycling back and forth. Everytime it cycled I can see the voltage jumping on my monster power conditioner. I am glad it the receiver was inexpensive so when I get a new one I can toss it out the window. I bought the unit in Aug 2006."
3,Interesting but geared toward larger companies ($10M and up),"If you are selling your business it is probably worth a few bucks to hear some words of wisdom from people who've been there. But I found it more applicable to large businesses, $10M and up, selling to corporations, etc. It is not really applicable to small businesses except in a general way."
4,Simply brilliant,"First, the kids loved playing with them. Then the adolescents strapped them on. Soon, the adults were taking turns skating across the carpet.Though they don't work exactly like skates, more like sliding on a newly waxed floor in socks, they are abundantly fun for all."
2,Fun Christmas,I bought these skates for my 8 year old niece. I also bought another pair for her sister (which her pair broke). These aren't very durable but the kids had a blast skating around the house.
4,Good product,"Bought these for my niece, they really move on the carpet. A little bit flimsy for a heavier teen, but they actually worked better."
3,Fun but easily breakable,"My daughter loves the carpet skates but I'm very disappointed that she wore them for all of about 5 minutes on Christmas day before they broke. The straps are attached to the sides of the skates with a bar of plastic. I'm ordering a new pair to replace the broken pair since this was a gift for her. Otherwise, I'd encourage her to skate in her socks on the hardwood floor. This product is a great idea that should be produced to be more durable."
2,Honestly...,"Honestly, it is kinda lame..Now, that said I would like to justify that response with...If I had a room full of carpet with no furniture this toy would be awesome! But that not being the case it is kinda hard to manuever around and my daughter has not played with it since..."
1,NOT as pictured,"I am not commenting on the performance of these highlighters because I will be returning them. I was hoping for some slightly less traditional colors, as pictured in the product page. However, I received ordinary highlighters in ordinary shades of blue, green, pink, yellow and purple. The part number listed on the page is the same as on the highlighters. I am quite disappointed as I was really looking forward to the interesting colors pictured."
2,"Product is good overall, but too wet","The colors for these highlighters are very nice and bold. It's nice to see the ink levels in the container. I was hoping for something that didn't bleed through to the next page, and it's so wet that it seems it may be unavoidable for any material that one highlights. Oh well. The search continues."
3,monroe sensatrac,"This item does fit the car it said it would fit in. The noise that my car would make when hitting a pothole on the road is gone.Thanks,"
4,"Good deal,even with the minor tweeks needed.","Good price,good part,excellent shipping. The only caveat is that unless you want to bleed your brakes when you are done,I highly recommend cutting the bracket for the brake line in the middle and prying it open to slip the line into place and then close it up with vise grips or the like afterward. There`s a nice how to on this on Youtube if you need the help."
2,"Pretty Pictures, and a lot of gibberish","This is a beautifully-illustrated coffee-table book about the Wagram campaign. It has virtually no value, however, as a text.First, the English translation is miserably bad. I was astonished to find that a book would actually be published without even a rudimentary editing job. Simple words are riddled with typos on every page, and some sentences are virtually incomprehensible - even on the back cover!Second, Hourtoulle's text is standard-issue hero-worship of Napoleon, to the point of silliness. Perhaps it sounded pretty in the original French, but with this translation, what we get is something that a proud ten-year-old might have written, if Napoleon had happened to be his father.For a lavish display of gorgeous pictures, it can't be beat."
2,Typos detract from what could have been a decent book,"I've seen better editing jobs on high school yearbooks. You can't beat these books for the depictions of the uniforms, but there is a typographical error on nearly every page. Additionally, someone didn't do a very good job on the translation either. For example, page 19, ""The Middle and Young Guards, illustrated themselves at Essling."" I suppose it's worth the price for the illustrations, but a poor read. Sloppy and unprofessional and a poor companion to Jena, Auerstadt and Borodino. I suppose you need to know how to spell in order to use spell check."
4,A good uniform reference,"The book is translated from the French, but translated so badly as to almost be unreadable. If you're looking for a history of the battle of Wagram, look somewhere else.But this is still an incredible book for the wargamer and modeller. Every single Austrian regiment has a full color plate. All the different French and allied uniforms are here. I haven't made a count, but I would guess there are a couple hundred uniform plates in the book."
2,"Great Drawings, Very Poor Writing","The Drawings and colors are exceptional; however, the translation from French by Alan McCay is horrendous. It looks as though a 10th Grade High School student wrote it for his D- grade. There doesn't appear to be any editor for this book. Please note, the other books on this series are equally poor. If you want a visual text on the Napoleonic Battle, this could still be a good book to have in your library. Perhaps one day, Histoire & Collections will do a Vol. 2 and edit out all the writing mistakes."
2,"This DVD is ""Act One""?","You knew something was wrong when this disc was being sold for a lower price than the ""other"" DAC ""Live at Billy Bob's"". This disc only has 6 songs, and nothing else. Amazon could've stated this in their advertising of this release. As usual, when there's no write-up, it's best to avoid it. You're better off forking out the extra 10 bucks for the good disc. Just thought you'd like to know. By the way, the six tunes are: ""Talkin' to the Blues"", ""Wreckless"", ""Nothin' to Lose (part2)"", ""When I was a Young Man"", ""Will You Remember Me"", and ""The Ride"". Total running time: 21:33."
2,a book not necessary to play the game,"as with most ad&d books except for the players' manual, this book adds information that you don't really need to play the game. sure it's nice for people who don't have time or energy to invent their own fantasy worlds with all that's in it. Of course the whole ad&d system is more like a cult hit than a solid roleplaying system..."
1,This is not worth your money,"I've been playing RPGs for over 6 years, so i consider myself somewhere between beginner and senior. I've have played many roleplaying games, and i've played a lot of AD&D. But this is not a game for anyone. There are to many rules, most of wich are not logical. The system is archaic. The settings are dull, and devoid of imagination.Go buy Warhammer Fantasy RPG instead..."
3,Only for new players,"The book is very well illustrated, and the larger type makes it slightly easier to read, but there is nothing new in here, so to speak. If you are just getting started on AD&D, then this is the resource you need. If you already have the 2nd Edition handbook, there is absolutely no reason to buy this book."
5,Great improvement in organization and editorial standards!,"I approached the new books with great scepticism, viewing them as yet another method to ""churn"" some new business. I'm happy to say though that the editorial standards (such as consistency, adherence to standard style etc.) as well as overall improved layout are really worthwhile. If your old books are losing pages etc., or if you do have the extra cash, it's not at all a bad investmentWill Fellowes"
4,Absolutley Reqired,"If your going to play AD&D then you NEED this book! It is absolutley essential for beginning players. It is easy to understand, except for a few unclear parts."
4,"Get the ""Father"" of RPG's!","I have done thousands of RPG's and started out with ""Dungeons and Dragons"". This is a worthy successor to the old game. I particularly like the new optional rules that allow you to add more fine details to your characters. The new illustrations help add to the game, and the new layout is a real joy. Highly recommended."
2,"Indispensable, yes, but no work of art.","I remember the old 1st edition Player's Handbook, and while it paled in comparison to the 1st edition DM Guide, it is still vastly more enjoyable to read than its 2nd edition incarnation. The color illustrations suck, every one of them. The book is written in a lifeless, dreary, almost technical writing style. This is a fantasy game, for cryin' out loud! There should be a sense of wonder about all this! For a rule book you've gotta have, TSR should have made this much more interesting. The AD&D game itself rates 5 stars."
5,A 21 on a D20,"Great book, a little lacking in the pictures but hey it was amazing. Very informative and an excellent addition to any DnD library. Use it every week in the campaign"
4,Almost a Five,"Not that this book isn't an awesome font for knowledge, but for adventurers, I rate this book second in importance only to the Players Options: Skills and Powers book."
3,Wait for 3rd edition PHB,Wait for 3rd edition PHB it is scheduled for release in August. I have been playing for 12 years and I liked the 2nd ed rules but 3rd ed is supposed to be quite interesting and all the new adventures will begin to be produced using these rules soon.
5,Dungeons and Dragons Players hand book,"I thought this book was a blast. If you are looking at my essay you should get this book if you like role playing and fantasy. Because you have to be elves, dwarves, and humans but I'm tellimg you YOU SHOULD GET THIS BOOK GUARANTEE!"
4,Second Edition AD&D,"Although the third edition books produced by TSR have pretty much replaced second edition on many book shelves, a few of us still prefer the game as it was. Having been a DM for a little over 18 years, I still find myself picking up my second edition players handbook, dungeon masters guide, and monster manuals (along with a littany of other second edition books) and wondering why it was ever changed.A must to have if you are a second edition fan is the players handbook. Simply stated, you cannot play the game without it. Although some of the artwork is lacking and (my biggest gripe) they do not put the spell level on every page of the spell directory, over all it is a very well put together book which I would be proud to recommend it to anyone who is wanting to play AD&D."
5,Great book!,This book has helped me tremendously in my class. I'm glad I bought it from Amazon b/c it was very affordable.
4,GOODNESS ROCKS!,"This is the only CD you'll need of Goodness up to this date, since it has everything from the band. Great rocking songs, Carrie Akre's got one of the most mesmerizing empowering voices in rock music! A must have for lovers of good rock and roll."
5,Lenny Breau is the man,"If you want to learn about the life of the greatest guitarist ever, this is the book. Plain and simple."
4,sibling rivalry,"i used to have this cd and lost it years ago, i haven't been able to find it to replace it since. it's great! it's joey ramone and his real brother together. if you love the ramones you have to have this, even if it is a little mellow compared to the ramones. his brother sings great."
3,"Where Is That Blankie! - a review of ""The Blanket""","This is a nice little book for babies and toddlers that focuses on that all important blankie. In this case, a small child (looks like a boy) can't find his blanket, so mom looks in the bathroom and dad in the hall closet. When it still doesn't show up, mom and dad continue the search in the hamper and in the car. The child looks under his bed, but nothing.Then the boy looks under his pillow. He finds the blanket and then goes to sleep. Sample text follows for your information.But we could notfind the blanket.So Mommylooked inthe hamper.And Daddylooked inthe car.But I found theblanket undermy pillow andwent to sleep.Three and a Half Stars. Okay read-aloud, this book might be a good choice for before naps or bedtime. Artwork is simple and sweet."
4,Not a bad game...,"It's not bad, although it is a bit challenging.In this game, you get to play as Yacko, Wacko and Dot and try to avoid being captured and being placed in the water tower (I don't know much about the plot of the game). If one or two of the Animaniacs get captured, you can go to the water tower and try to make it to the top to free them.Play style is mainly action-platformer... so, if you liked Animaniacs and this kind of gameplay, this game might be worth looking in to. Or, if you've never seen the Animaniacs T.V. show, you still may want to look into this game. Even though it's kind of a kid's game, it is still a challenge."
3,Anamamndes;lfd,This game is like the seris gay. The game is hard because you have no health and the bad guys.... well they do. Even the average bad dude could be a boss so i leave it at that with 3 stars
5,"If you like someone really on the abyssmal edge,","--not someone just playing around with goth or whatever. This is an archetypal dark woman. I tend to write some reviews prematurely, after only one listen sometimes, like with this one. But at least I know Jarboe from Swans. I was very impressed with the consistency and macabre spirit here, track to track. In fact, folks, it really feels like a Swans album, maybe between TGA and SFTB. Complete with great art pieces; this isn't one to burn and sell. Very easy to see why Gira accepted her into his own dark world. She had a couple of jewels while in Swans, got better and ready to bust out (you could tell) in SOUNDTRACKS-- , and here is putting it together w/ a bit more panache. A very welcome find."
4,Great book for little hands!,"This is a small board book that is filled with pictures of farm animals. It teaches the child the sounds that the animals make and also teaches them something about each animal as Barney visits each one. For example, for the cow, it teaches children that milk comes from cows and that the sound they make is ""Moo, Moo"".I love this book and my 9 month old loves it as well! It is great especially if you make the animal noises realistic!"
5,BUY IT!!!,"Buy it, your children will enjoy it. If you can make the animal sounds realistically, they will enjoy it even more, but even without it, the book is enjoyable. The pictures are also nice."
5,Awesome Sweeper,I have had mine for years. It picks up debris without any effort. Saves me time and backache from a normal broom when sweeping the sidewalk and driveway. I love it!
4,Radiator,Was suprised it did not look like the picture. It was packaged securely and except of a few fins (more than I wish) it appears to be cooling just fine. Had an exact fit and easy to install.
5,Great for developing scissor skills!,"I am using this book with my elementary school-aged children to help teach them eye-hand coordination and basic scissor skills. The kids love cutting out the challenging but fun costumes and are motivated to do their best work. This book utilizes heavier stock paper which is easier for the children to manipulate. There are dozens of outfits in a wide variety of themes, so you are sure to find something to please. I had just as much fun as the children cutting out the clothing and dressing up George."
4,"A little weak in the sound department, but overall a winner.","Despite the lack of a full sound, this has got to be one of the most refreshing albums i've bought in a long time. ""Rain"" is the track to really check out. Maybe their next release will find its' way into more stores and stations. I can't wait!"
5,Excellent and Proper English Translation of the Orthodox NT,"The One-Volume Edition of the Famous Orthodox New Testament by Holy Apostles Convent is exceptional. I highly endorse this English translation of the Official Greek New Testament text as published and approved by the Patriarch of Constantinople for both private study and liturgical use in The Holy Orthodox Church. The English translation is beautiful and sublime. The cadence of its sentences with the accuracy of its English in its proper translation of the Greek is a great combination. More than any other English translation this is the ONLY english translation of the New Testament that should be used by every Orthodox Christian (It gets the energy words exactly right!). It is literally the Best English translation of the New Testament on the market, and probably the best one ever since the King James Version. I highly endorse and recommend the Orthodox New Testament one-volume edition. Axios!"
5,A most accurate New Testament,"If you are seeking a New Testament closes to its original written language (Greek) this is an excellent version, as a single word missed or deleted from the modern versions, readily available, can change (modify) the meaning of the original message or place it in a different perspective. Although a bit difficult to read at times,with patience and good understanding, you can extract a tremendous amount of knowledge and wisdom."
3,Not a saguaro - not even a cactus,"There's nothing wrong with selling this euphorbia - it looks like an interesting and attractive succulent, and I may get one for my collection. The problem is accurate identification. Euphorbias are NOT cacti. The Saguaro is NOT a euphorbia - it's a specific species of cactus: Carnegiea gigantica, a species that grows taller than a house. ""Miniature Saguaro"" is an oxymoron, like ""elected monarch."""
3,2 in the tent? No way!,"I did a bicycle tour from Philadelphia to Maine this summer - 8 days on the bike - and used this tent as my night-time shelter.I was looking for a light-weight tent that would pack up into a tight bundle, and this tent fit the bill.The tent is light and easy to pack. It also will setup fairly quickly. I was able to sit up inside the tent, so I never felt very claustrophobic - but there is no way that this tent could hold 2 adults. I did a backyard test run of the tent before my trip - and slept in the tent with my 5 year old son - and there was not much room at all (I am 5'7"", 180lbs).While stealth camping one night during the tour, I was hit with a pretty heavy rain-storm, and this tent kept me dry (although it was like sleeping inside of a drum with all the rain pelting the tent) ;)Generally I was happy with the tent, but if I had to re-do my purchase, I would buy a self-supporting tent - which this one is not."
2,"Not a two person tent, not a one person tent.","There's simply no way two people could sleep in this tent. From the inside it measures about 4' at the shoulder, the widest point, and about 1.5' at the foot. The stakes are really cheap, and I bent half of them just setting the tent up in the back yard (I guess I have to mention on the plus side, they're easy to bend back too). I noticed another stake had bent after it had been set up a while in moderate wind. In the rain, water likes to pool on the top near the foot of the tent.I give it two stars rather than one, because they could have done worse. It's not too bad as a one person tent. But if you want a one person tent, you probably want something smaller, if you want a two person tent, you definitely need something bigger. I'm 6'1 175lbs and have no issues with room in the tent on my own. But there's very little room for any more gear, my Redcloud 5600 doesn't comfortably fit in it with me, which is what I was hoping for."
5,Best and only option available to extend your antenna,"After searching for a way to get my Sirius antenna to run over RG6 coaxial cable I came across this product for satellite/Sirius combiner/splitter. I hooked this up with no intention of hooking a satellite into this product, I wanted to run my Sirius radio antenna from my basement to an antenna on the roof. Sirius only has a 50' extension available that uses a proprietary cable. So I needed to be able to get my antenna signal to ""run"" over a coaxial cable. This product worked beautifully even without a satellite feed hooked into it. The price is great for what it does and allows you to use regular coaxial cable to extend your antenna more than 50'."
4,Works as expected,"Worked without any major problems. One small issue is that the small cable came out it the connecter and neeeded to be crimped.Most importantly, it also works with the new HD 5 LNB Directv dish."
1,Big Disappointment,"I installed the Sirius DBS kit today and was disappointed with its NON-performance. I also purchased the Sirius external antenna kit which worked very well, but the DBS kit just didn't work with my DirecTV system. The Sirius DBS combiner and especially the cable connectors are junk as the entire kit is made in China. I'm a Sirius supporter with 2 accounts but this kit nees to be reengineered."
5,The Dragon Slayer with a Heavy Heart,"This book made a tremendous impact on my life. For anyone that worries about things they are unsure of, you don't realize how much it is weighing you down. After I read this book, I realized that I can't change other people, only myself, and worrying about things that are out of my control was only hurting me. I have read this book twice in two weeks. It's absolutely the best book I have ever read."
5,Help doesn't have to be 600 pages long!,"This book was a great story. Sometimes less is more. The book was entertaining in its brevity but packed a heavy punch. There are too many of us that carry heavy hearts. This was a real inspiration to me. Some of the lessons seem so simple but sometimes it's those things that confuse us the most. I think that if we can all apply the valuable lessons of this book, we'd all be better. I highly recommend this publication."
4,Sizing runs small,I wear an women's 8-8 1/2 shoe and the 7-9 size was kind of small for my foot. I gave them to my daughter who wears a 7 1/2 -8 and they fit her just fine. The 9-11 fin is quite a jump up in size and width. The quality of the fin itself is OK although not quite like the old voit which I have a pair of so easy to compare. These fins do float however which is a big plus.
3,a gift,i never saw it. good deal for the price. I don't know what else to write about this. it was a gift
3,breaking and carriages,"I draw better pictures then the diagram person did. The pictures probably looked better in color. I saw more types of show carriages then I cared to look at.There was actually precious little on breaking the horse to carriage, but plenty of pictures of show carriages.According to the author all horses will freak out, bolt and trash everything should a blinker driving bridle not be used. Okay, well I look at many pictures of other driving horses, some don't have blinkers and they are minding their driver just fine, so...obviously it can be done with a heck of a lot of patience. not to mention the author explained how to adjust height on the blinkers, but not how to bend them out a little to keep them off the eyeballs of your horse.Lots left out.could be improved, but not bad for the price."
3,Proceed with Caution,"There is one significant part of this book with which I must take issue. After one succeeds in harnessing and then hitching the green horse to the cart, do NOT, under any circumstances, follow the book's advice to then lead the horse with the empty cart behind. I did this and the horse was so alarmed by the noise behind him that he took off with me running alongside, hanging on to the bridle, trying to get a badly frightened running horse to stop. We finally came to a fence, much to the relief of us both. Since then, I've spoken to several 'driving' trainers and all of them, without exception, say to never, ever lead a horse with an empty cart behind. If I had been unable to keep up with my panicked horse (and it was a miracle that I could) he would have wrecked and most probably his driving days would have been over. Following that horrible event, he had to go back to square one in his training and be brought slowly forward again."
1,The worst book I've ever had the misfortune of reading,"It is difficult for me to explain just how truly terrible this book is. For one thing, about the first half the book is spent discussing C and thus the very title (""C++: The Complete Reference"") is misleading. As a reference the book fails miserably with topics presented as if the author just made up a list of things that came into his mind while he was at the keyboard. The code samples accompanying each topic have no discernible educational value - nothing of use to either student or professional programmer. The explanations aren't worthy of the title ""Reference."" Please buy something else."
5,Awesome Reference,"This is an awesome reference book, I have several of Schildt's books, and I would recommend them to anyone in programming. It's great if you're just starting out with the language, or if you're an experienced programmer looking for a reference for the language."
3,Didn't answer the question I bought the book for,"My older references are in storage and I thought it would be neat to have a c++ ref on my kindle. It says reference and the reviews are good, so I bought it.I wanted to be reminded of how to use variable numbers of parameters for macro defines. Forget whether this is a good idea. It's a language feature and I want to know how it works.#define with parameters is handled in one paragraph which doesn't even include the possibility of multiple parameters, let alone any details. Given this, I was curious to see if there was any discussion of the continuation-line functionality in the preprocessor. Nope. Not there.I'm sure this is a wonderful c++ primer as the other reviews indicate. My spot check demonstrates that this is in no way a complete reference.Even if you don't like a coding style, completeness allows you to read the code of others.So I'm out $28 bucks and my question isn't answered. oh well."
2,"""Complete Reference"" far from complete","I'm a developer who understands basic C++ concepts. I bought this book so that I could understand more advanced features of the language, and I've found it sorely lacking. Most topics are covered briefly and show only extremely obvious examples, which are not helpful in understanding the mechanisms involved.This book may have some value for programmers new to C++, but its claim to be a ""complete reference"" is a wild exaggeration."
5,"Its a Reference , Not to teach","First thing you should know about it is that its a reference, it covers language syntax and features , doesn't teaches that to you. IF YOU ALREAY KNOW C++ ONLY THEN BUY IT AND REFER TO IT WHEN YOU ARE WRITING A Programe and are confused in the syntax."
2,Not one of the better ones,"At first glance, this book looked very helpful. But then I actually followed the book and the resume I ended up with was VERY cluttered. So are most of the examples in the book, which all follow the same look: very little white space, too much information crammed in, overuse of bullets - all leading to a single-spaced, bullet-heavy, text-intensive resume. This book seems to assume that recruiters and others will take the time to read the whole thing when often the opposite is true. Just a glance at the layout may be enough to put them off instead. I just can't recommend it when there are books like ""Resumes That Knock 'Em Dead"" by Martin Yate or ""The Damn Good Resume"" by Yana Parker (which got me good jobs for years)."
1,"Too much money, not enough content","This book has good information, but it is the same information that you can get for free on the internet. There are a couple of interesting patterns but in my opinion, not worth the hefty price. I was buying as a gift for someone and found that it look too inexpensive as it is low on pages. It's definitely for a beginner that is not computer savvy."
4,Beading with a Loom,"This is a good book. It has several patterns for doing beading on a Loom. Mostly large projects. Good instructions for how to do loom work, but not a lot of instruction for each individual design. Over all I thought it was expensive for what the book is."
4,Weaving with beads made easy,"Being new to bead weaving I found the off loom tutorial invaluable, step by step pictures and instructions were easy to follow and along with the patterns provided this made my journey into this aspect of seed beading a great adventure."
2,Very disappointed and not for beginners. Also way too pricey .,"For the price of this magazine - $20.00, I was very disappointed. It was described as a ""Paperback"", but it is actually a thin magazine with no instructions on threading the loom, picking out a loom, where to buy materials for the loom or really what you even need to do bead loom work with. I am a beginner and this is not for beginners. The patterns are complicated and overwhelming for a beginner and quite a few of the patterns are done as a split loom and as a beginner, , this is something way out of my skill level. The magazine did contain some beautiful patterns for someone who is VERY SKILLED and not a beginner. I will be looking for a book next time, not a magazine, that starts with the basics . Very disappointed ."
2,Way Over Priced!,This pamphlet has some decent beginners instruction but I can easily find many instructions for free on the internet that are as good as or even much better than these. The patterns are ok but nothing extraordinary to account for such a high price for only 32 pages.
4,One of the best Pure releases.,"I don't understand the previous bad reviews of this CD. I really like 'Feverish' & consider it one of Pure's best releases. I'm not very good at describing the sound & the music but here goes. I think it's really FUN, light-hearted pop-alt-rock. A bit reminiscent of 60's era, flower power pop & psychedelica, but with some new, futuristic or modern instrumentation like the crunchy guitars & the electronic synthesizer sounds. The lyrics are simple but always express the fun in the music. 'March of the Loonies' is great, funky & fun & I also like the title track & 'Trucks, Campers & Trees'."
4,"Not much of a novel, but very entertaining","The Catsitters is a fun ""summer novel"", with a rather weak story line, causing it to drag toward the end. The first half, during which the author's style is established, and Darlene favors Johnny with most of her fascinating advice on dating behavior, flows well. The second half is less charming, and is saved only by the narrator's consistently funny observational asides. e.g. ""...his date arrived at the reading with a water bottle...just in case of sudden drought."" That technique reminds me of Joseph Wambaugh, who does the same thing in dialogue rather than narration, with even greater comic impact."
3,Simple Tale of Romance,"Johnny was a hometown boy, who couldn't seem to keep a girl, and was trying to make it as an actor in New York. But his background plagued him, and caused him to misbehave around his classy Upper East Side girlfriend.What was amazing about the book was how the writer, James Wolcot, used Darlene, Johnny's friend and relationship coach that lived in Georgia to guide Johnny his activities in New York. This was accomplished through constant telephones, faxes and snail mail. Email, Darlene thought, and she was adamant about all her views, was absolutely classless.Johnny was a rarity; a sensitive man who loved his cat and was loved by dying grandmother and it was the situation surrounding the fatal illness of his cat and grand mother that propelled him, un-aggressively, towards the beginning of a more rewarding life.The Catsitters is a good fast read. I finished it over a weekend."
2,Just Mediocre,"This book was easy to read, but left little to no (positive) impression on me. I read or at least skimmed all the other reviews and I was surprised to see than many people gave this book 4 stars, despite the fact that they only thought it was mediocre and seemed to have problems with it. One of those problems I could relate to, is that the main character, Johnny Downs, let his ""friend"" Darlene practically control his life. Was he really THAT clueless of a man, let alone a human, that he needed this woman's advice to manipulate his every move when it came to his love life? While some seemed to like Johnny, I thought he was a weak pushover with little character. His lack of substance as a person was annoying and I found him to be extremely wimpy. Overall, I would not recommend this book to a friend. Not that it was awful, but it was only okay. The ending was somewhat cheesy and predictable and once I finished it I was more than ready to read something better."
4,surprisingly good,"I wasn't expecting much when i picked up ""the catsitters"" to finally read. I bought it primarily because i can't go into a bookstore without buying something. But i ended up really enjoying this novel. Johnny wasn't a bachelor slob who had no charm whatsoever, he seemed very real life--neither purely evil or purely good. Darlene was also a believeable character. The exploits of the cat from time to time were interesting, and the book ended well, though not with a bang like some novels, but with a good ending that wrapped everything up. A good read in your spare time."
2,Boring. Shallow.,"I couldn't stand this book. The main character was uninteresting, the plot dragged, Wolcott alternately starves the reader of information or completely overshares (we get complete rundowns of movies Johnny Downs has seen, phone conversations he's had, and not one single moment of these paragraphs illuminates the character's inner workings.) There were also multiple copy editing errors in my edition (which I blame not so much on Wolcott, but on the folks at HarperCollins), and they were of the ignorant variety rather than simple typos: ""trey"" for the French word ""tres,"" ""prune"" instead of ""prude,"" etc. Overall a very poor effort. I read it to the end, but it was a struggle."
3,A good effort,"I did enjoy this book but I felt as though it were lacking a key element, and that element would have made this a better book. Characters made their entrances and exits without making a supreme impact on the outcome of this book.But non the less, it was a good time passers...read it when you are on the bus..."
1,terrible service and bad laptop,It was the most terrible experience to own this one.Soon the keyboard started falling and the connection cord had problems as it got loosened up.After couple of months i had trouble closing the laptop as the screren would remain on.When I got to the service folks they refused to admit any problems and tried to push every thing on me. the battery drains in just 45 minutes. the laptops starts tomake lout fan noice after couple of months.GUys this is a terrible the whole customer service from best buy was rude. I wud just say u buy this product and pray that it turns out ok the whole service warranty etc is to drain further money out of you.
3,"First timers, buy other Alice Donut albums before this one","Do not get me wrong, this is a very good album, only compared to ""Revenge"", ""Mule"", ""Buckefuls"", and ""Untidy""(and even ""Donut Comes Alive"") this album has to be considered the worst. When you listen to the Alice Donut albums in the order that they came out, you can see the changes in music style that they make on each.(Not one album sounds like another, except ""Pure Acid Park"". With this album, I found myself thinking that Alternative Tentacles collected all of the leftover tracks that were not good enough for ""Untidy"" and put them on a cd to sell. Still, overall, it is a descent album and after hearing the other Alice Donut albums, you will become a Alice Donut fan and have to buy this cd as I did.(I remember being so exciting when it was first released and extremely disappointed after listening to it.) Still, it is digestable."
2,There is one song I like on this...,I gave it 2 stars because I at least like one song: track 6- The Senator and the Cabin Boy -really weird and really good!!!But I couldn't salvage anything else from this album.
5,Excellent resource for iLife users,"I've had my iMac for about a year now and thought I had become a reasonably successful user of the iLife software (iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD). Since purchasing this book, I now realize I have only scratched the surface of possibilities for my iMac as the 'digital hub' of my home. This book/DVD combo provides for the most effective method of learning I've come across in a how-to book; I read about the steps necessary to complete an action- for example, within iMovie, then watch it on the DVD, then try it myself, stopping to pause and review the DVD if I find myself a little confused or unsure of the next step. The book and DVD complement each other perfectly. I am extremely pleased with this book. It has demonstrated the elegance and intuitive simplicity for which I bought an Apple computer. Kudos to the author and editorial team."
5,Great Book. Killer DVD.,"Buy this book and an iMac and you'll never look back! Great read, and an awesome DVD. If your into digital photography, music or making home movies this book shows you how the digital hub applications are so simple a child could use them, but they also are so powerful as a professional I would swear by them."
4,Compendium of the bizarre,"This book covers an eclectic selection of essays. My favorite is the story of the plight of the poor computer programmer who sees himself as a tiger, and the lengths to which he anthropomorphizes himself."
5,Works as intended,I've been using this for about a year and a half now with my macro lens and nikon camera with no issues.
4,Pretty Much A No Brainer,The item is an adapter ring to allow mounting the Sigma Ring Flash on lenses with a 77mm filter thread. You screw it on and you are set to go.
3,Tasteful Murder in SF?,"Is it possible for Michigan computer consultant Anneke Haagen and her pro-football-player-turned cop hubby to enjoy a quiet honeymoon in San Francisco? Apparently not--their romantic idyll is disrupted when Anneke and Karl witness the murder of a beautiful graduate student in a sports bar, and Anneke and Karl must set aside their amorous exploits to solve the case.This book is a delightful, one-evening read; just sit down with your favorite Midwestern cuisine and nibble away. Or better yet, take the book with you on your next trip to San Francisco. The author, Susan Holtzer, has included her own favorite real-world SF restaurants in the novel, so this book can do double duty: read it in the airport as a murder mystery, then take Better than Sex around the city with you as a local dining guide!"
3,It's ok,"Maybe I don't know alot about the subgenres and the like, but I know what I like when I hear it.After all the hype I stumble across regarding thse guys I guess I expected more. More surprises, more diversity, more,... I mean it's ok and everything, but call me crass , I had more fun with the Kruder and Dorfmeister remix set,... sorry. If amazon had 1/2 stars I would say 2.5"
2,Machined songs,"Music in the electronic way: interesting rythms, nice melodies, soft singin'. It's all mixed into one idiom, one tempo, no dynamics, ondoubtedly fine to dance on high volumes; probably fuddling. In 1982 bluessinger Alison Moyet joined Yazoo: same effect. I use it for lounging; deep basses, low volumes.Peter"
3,This cd is ok a bit boring though,"OVERALL I FEEL THAT THE CD WAS A BIT BORING. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERY TRACK SOUNDED THE SAME. I MANY TIMES FOUND MYSELF LOSING ATTENTION. THE BEST TRACKS ON THE CD TO ME ARE ""MEN FROM THE NILE"", ""TROBY TRIO"", AND ""MARSHMELLOWS"", THE ONLY ARTIST ON THIS COMP TO ACTUALLY HOLD MY ATTENTION.NOT ESSENTIAL"
5,Brings back old memories,"Although I have never met the author, I did know her brother Yonichi. I also know his 4 daughters. This book brought back memories of my time in the relocation camp in Minidoka, ID."
4,I like this Memoir,"As a memoir this is well written, 4 star but not a five star book, the author had the experience of being an American of Japanese ancestry living on the west coast, who was put in a Japanese internment camp (well 4 or so actually) from the early months of 1942 through the end of World War II, along with her older brother and Japanese born mother and father. The entire memoir is fairly well written, a little repetative at times, and a bit strange, but that is allowed in memoirs. Personally I am glad to read the actual memoir of a young person who lived through the WWII internment camps here in the USA. Too bad her brother who fought in Italy did not also write his memoirs before his untimely passing, as his would also have been very interesting."
4,Looking Like the Enemy: My Story of Imprisonment in Japanese American...,"A great read that gave you a different perspective of WWII. Tells the true story of a Japanese family and what happens to them after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Made me really look at the Japanese people I know today and found that some of them had been sent to camps, whereas I really hadn't thought about it much on a personal basis."
5,The BEST New Age music there is!,"Patrick O'Hearns best. When you first get a Patrick album, the songs sound nice, but you don't love them immediately. You have to listen to each album every day for 2 weeks to fall in love with a few of the songs. I would call the style ""Experimental Jazz-based New Age."" Similar to Tangerine Dream, but the sounds here are not so exotic. The whole album is great; the tracks ""Faith and Endurance,"" ""Let Truth Prevail,"" and ""Crossing the Divide"" are masterpieces. Each exhibits his unique genius at playing the melodic line of a song super-slowly. (Taking many measures per note.) The second also has a wonderful experiment in playing the melodic line on a piano with one finger. I can't imagine how he made it so great! His 2 other great albums are Indigo, and Eldorado. If you love this album, try some Tangerine Dream! (I can't imagine why people call this music ""dark""? -- It's very peaceful!)"
3,Good but not his best work...,"Of all his recording this particular recording is the least varied although at outset the primal tribal aspect is rather intriguing. Hmmmm.. Tribal electronic music. The problem is that there are less sonic colors than in any of his previous recordings. Of course Patrick set a pretty strong pace there and it's hard for all of them to be gems. I like this recording but I have to admit that unlike his other recordings, I have to be in the mood for it. It is not the Patrick O'Hearn recording I would reach for when I want to hear Patrick O'Hearn. This recordings is thematic somewhat like a short film soundtrack. A good recording but not equal to his other works."
3,"Pretty cool, but has its issues","This is a neat little sound machine for the price, and I really like the light show! But (like the Homedics unit I bought previously) the only sound I like is the Spring Rain; all of the others sounds too fake.I also believe the aromatherapy feature is useless - the fan is *very* noisy. I also found it humorous that the user's manual recommends putting the beads back in the vial after every use.I see that some reviewers have considered this unit portable; that must be without the crystal ball? Speaking of the crystal ball, it doesn't fit too snugly. I wanted to to keep the unit on my nightstand for convenience, but I'm too afraid of knocking the ball off when reaching for the alarm or anything else nearby. So it has to go somewhere else. :-("
1,anything but relaxing,"Unfortunately, after I ordered the crystal ball I read the customer reviews. One that stuck in my mind was the customer who had it burn up. I regreted ordering it right away but it was already on the way. So it arrives and the cord is very skimpy and the buttons don't always work. The white noise sounds like television static and the colors are lame. The aromatherapy beads smell good but the machine makes a loud buzzing sound when its working. Then I read another review dated just a few days ago that said their's had shorted out. Who could sleep with this thing on worrying about it catching on fire? I think Amazon.com should look into the possible safety hazards of this rinky-dink product. The cord is made of wire smaller than my phone line, is flat and kinks easily. Forget about this one!"
4,I can't stay awake long enough to enjoy the light show!,"This is a good product, overall.It looks cool next to our 8foot round water bed. The sphere is pretty, even in the daylight. The timer is easy to set. There are a couple of drawbacks but nothing I would return it for. The sounds aren't distinct enough for me, especially the crickets (my favorite) but they do put me to sleep!! The background noise is too loud but it does the job.The pulsating light really does it with the heart beat but it is hard to detect for other sounds. The light change is subtle but the bonus of seeing it reflected on the wall above makes up for that. I was under the impression the colors changed but you have to select just one...maybe that can be changed?I know our grandkids will love it when they visit this summer!"
2,Not as good as it looks,"The padded ""feet"" don't stay in which causes the unit to wobble. The lighting is not adjustable (no dimming). Looks nicer on the page than in person."
3,Not too many features but it works,"The watch is good, just wish it would save the time splits. You get what you pay for, all and all it works and seems pretty durable."
1,"Hard to read instructions, couldn't use product","I was happy when I received the stopwatch until I tried to use it. The instructions were on one small sheet of paper that three different people tried to follow to set the time and an alarm, to no avail. It now sits on a table waiting for the battery to run out or for my grandsons to visit because it shouldn't frustrate them to play with it, since they are 4 and 6 years old.Unhappy watch ownerKelly"
5,Big Digits,"Big digits, exactly what I needed and it was not in any of the normal sports stores in my area."
3,Good but a frame is a little bulky,"Simply does what it's supposed to, which is measure time.. But the frame in the picture seemed a little less bulky than what it is in reality."
3,Stopwatch,I was a little disappointed in this product because the instructions for setting up the different functions are quite vague. I still have not been able to use all the functions because I don't know how to make them work.
1,This thing SUCKS!!!,"Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this product! it constantly double-taps. By that, I mean that when you stop the timer, it will very often immediately re-start itself.What good is a timer that stops for a split second and then starts running again?This happens to me about 30%- 40% of the time. Spend a few buck more, and get a more reliable product.If you are a coach or a ref, this little piece of junk will seriously embarrass you! BEWARE!!!"
3,Read about that questionable 5 year warranty?,"Watch seems to work OK, and I am happy with it so far, with the exception of the warranty. I received it this week. 06/16/08. It has a free replacement period ending 03/2009. About 9 months. Then till 03/2013 replacement carries a $10.00 fee plus the fee to ship it to them. I paid less than that for the watch on Amazon and got free shipping. I call that a 9 month replacement warranty."
2,worked fine for a while . . .,"then it no longer worked. Strange that you can't really turn this thing off. If it doesn't break within a month (which it did), I imagine that the battery will die at some point. Also no instructions came with the thing, which means either the manufacturer was careless or just doesn't care about this product.That being said, I give it an additional star from the lowest rating because when it worked, it worked fine."
2,Worked just fine...,"But like other reviewer pointed out, died within a couple months. Only got to use it about 6-7 times. May just need to be opened and have the baterry replaced, though."
3,"Simple, works, battery dies in three months","This is a simple, reliable stop watch, big and sturdy with big display.I used it to time my kids soccer practices and games. It survived rain and abuse. Fortunately it worked all season, then it died. Just got a new battery and we'll see how long it lasts on a fresh charge. Frustrating to have such a short life though.One year follow up: still going well on the new battery. Clearly the battery it comes with is well discharged by the time you get it."
1,Lasted six weeks with minimal use,Ahh... modern times! I come from the era of mechanical stop-watches that lasted forever. Well this lasted six weeks with very little use.
2,Easy To Read; Hard To Control,"Not the greatest stopwatch I've ever owned. The numbers on the screen are large and easy to read. But the big problem is that 90% of the time when you hit the start/stop button, the button double taps. In other words: you get two beeps instead of one...if you are pushing to stop the clock you do for one split second before unintentionally starting it again. Very, very frustrating."
2,50/50 Result,"I bought two of these. One works fine upon receipt, the other one will need to be dissected because the start/stop button doesn't always react."
5,Great value Timer,"This timer is very accurate, easy to use, and has large easy to read numbers. I don't know how it can be sold for such a low price. The guy who could not find the instructions in an earlier review did not look very hard. The instructions are there in every timer. They are printed on the inside of the package material, not on a separate paper sheet. I have had mine for over a year and I am very satisfied. It will be the best ten dollars you have ever spent!"
2,Accusplit survivor stopwatch,"Had to return it, did not mention that it doesn't count down. But you do get what you pay for, It was a good price for basic stop watch functions."
5,Straight forward & easy to operate stopwatch,"simple controls, easy to use... low price... good value... just get the thing if you need a stop watch..."
1,bad bad bad,Has stopped working within 2 months of purchase. I started the stopwatch and forgot to stop it. That may have triggered it to brake. Very unstable product.
1,never worked,"this watch never worked, was broken when delivered. it was given as a gift and was thrown away."
3,"Too THICK, but works fine!","Functionally it is a ok or good product for the money. The only downside is the thickness and size. It is bulky and too thick so that it is not much convenient practically. BTW, Good side due to its size is that you hardly misplace it and the display is large enough for me. In addition, it has variety of functions for the money I paid, so I will keep it."
2,Sticky buttons,"I've had this thing for about a month now, and I am pretty frustrated. I bought it so that I could use it to time my traffic reports (I'm in the radio business) which must be exactly 40 sec. I thought I might use it to countdown, but I find it easier to just count upward.The problem is that the buttons on top either double touch (immediately stopping and starting at the same moment with only one press) or don't start at all. I've messed up my timing so many times I'm just going to throw this thing out. I expected a lot more for the price. If I wanted something that I could take the chance that it didn't work well i would've bought one for 5 bucks. I sent more because I thought I would be getting a better product.I regret not reading the reviews for this thing before I bought it. I don't usually do that for an item like this, I didn't care about features and such, and I figured it was a thing that just works."
3,Good Watch..,"This is a pretty good quality watch as far as the watch itself, but the string makes it very easy to lose. The knot come loose and you lose your watch! (My husband lost his that way.) Maybe it's supposed to be break away, I don't know. Another problem is there is no light, so you can't see the time in a dark area. So far these are the only major problems with the watch, but they are pretty major issues."
3,Not so good.,"Revisiting my review after 6 months of use:Now both bottons failed. There are very thin metal plates that act like springs to push the bottons back when pressed. After several uses, they become flat and ineffective so the botton stays pushed down/touches the sensors randomly. One fix I found is to re-bend the plates or place rubber material beneath the plate to keep it from getting pressed down easily.OLDER REVIEW:Excellent screen size and reasonable overall watch size.One of the bottons does not click anymore, is still works when you press it, but does not click."
4,what was expected,"I wanted a stop watch to time my daughters track meets. This watch does what it says it will, I like the features like the split time and the first and second place times. My only complaint is that the instructions are very sparse and hard to understand, but playing with it should have you up and running in no time."
1,"Supposedly does splits, but not really","When I bought this in a sporting goods store, I told the salesperson I was looking for a stopwatch that would allow me to monitor my split times. He pointed to this stopwatch, which advertises that it monitors splits. However, as far as I can tell (with the absolutely horrible ""instructions"" on the back of the package), it will only stop and restart when you try to use split mode. It doesn't maintain information about the split times. Well, when I'm running I hardly have time to write down the split times before starting the stopwatch up again, so after a relatively long run I have no idea how long each of the split times were because all that will show is the final, total running time. Boo on this product."
3,I still like it but...,"It double clicks regularly (acts as if you pushed the button twice and you don't get an accurate time (I don't need to be that accurate, so it's not that bad for me, but if you do have to be accurate be careful). I am a teacher and use this stopwatch regularly. I like the click in the buttons instead of a beep that distracts the students. I use it as a clock as well and just wear it around my neck. I have used several stopwatches and this is still my favorite even with the double click flaw."
1,Did SHE ever try it???,"My reactions to this book, and to the fasting method it promotes, are mixed. I have strong suspiciouns that, like most self-help books, the need to pad a small amount of essential information has led her to add many things that don't need to be there--the daily routine she prescribes is utterly unrealistic for a person eating three solid meals, let alone existing only on juice and broth. But my biggest complaint is with the juice recipes, which she clearly has never actually made. About the ""morning drink"" recipe, made in a blender, she says, ""If there's any left over, have that for an afternoon pick me up."" Lady, if you follow your recipe, it makes nearly a half gallon of the stuff. Sorry, but I'm getting a little cynical about the new age cash cow."
5,Awesome cleansing program!,I've done this cleansing program for 3 years now and love it. It really works and the juice recipes are easy and taste good. I've recommended it to all of my friends when they are feeling run down and just need a few days to themselves to get rested and healthy again.
3,Unforgiveable that endnotes are not linked,"In a Kindle edition of a book of this type, it's unforgiveable that the endnotes are not linked. If a book decides on endnotes rather than footnotes, it should be a given that electronic editions must be linked. In a paper edition, at least you can flip straight to the back of the book. Do you know how many moves it takes to find an unlinked endnote on the Kindle?"
2,"Not with the ""Maps"" I thought.","I really thought there would be a lot of graphics (""maps"") in this book to make it easier to visualize the historical content. But not so."
2,disappointed gatlin bros fan,"Should have stuck to the old saying 'you only get what you pay for'. this dvd should be entitled HIGHLIGHTS OF THE GATLIN BROS AT BILLY BOBS, TEXAS. Approximately 20 minutes of veiwing time, six songs only, virtually no banter included from Larry Gatlin. Sound and picture quality ok but doesn't appear to be up to the standard of other 'live from billy bobs' shows I have in my collection.I should have spent the extra 10 dollars and purchased the other concert listed.The problem is and I'm sure other purchasers have come across it on many occasions, the lack of information given e.g. track listings, length of concert, etc. I for one would probably purchase far more items if I could be sure of exactly what I was getting for my money.Keith Sharpe, Lincoln, England"
1,Awful beyond all reason.,"Bob ""the animal man"" Klein has no discernible mantis martial arts lineage. He manages to reduce a dynamic energetic martial arts style to a series of alternately comical, alternately tragic arthritic antics. His knowledge of form and function is non-existent. For actual Praying Mantis Kung fu, look for Brendan Lai, Su Yu-Chang, Al Cheng, or Lee Kam Wing. Or even Jon Funk (although admittedly Mr. Funk is pretty mediocre, at least his lineage is real)."
1,"Boring, weak plot, weak acting, the worst film ever I SWEAR","This is the worst Voodoo film I have ever seen or even the worst horror movie of all time.It starts like that, a man and his wife move to England because the husband has work there. The husband is very busy with his work and doesn't give his wife any attention. Then the wife finds 2 corps in the basement and she decides to kill her free time studying these corps (the husband has no problem with that) and then the usual happens, wife possessed by the soul of a voodoo queen, people trying to tell husband that his wife is possessed, husband doesn't believe, Wife starts to freak husband, husband believes and goes back to the people who wanted to help him then a small exorcism and boom the movie is over.I don't know how this movie got all these high ratings. If you really want to see this movie rent it don't buy it"
3,Not for Anyone...This is specifically for women,"The moves are impressive and look flashy. But the problem I have with this product is that it is obviously intended for Women. So the title should actually read ""Any Woman can Dance: Nightclub Freestyle"".If you take dance lessons, where this falls flat is the fact that the woman starts on her right and the man on his left. Since this is obviously geared towards women the performer never covers the left side start for men. Also, many of the moves are geared to showcase the woman, and frankly I dont think alot of men are going to want to move that way."
5,"Great Game, Questionable Prices (sometimes)","This quick review isn't of the game itself (which is my number one favorite of the several dozen and I own and with over 30 years of active gaming under my belt).This is a review of the PRICE. If you're paying more than $50 for this game in an online purchase, then you are a victim of price gouging and you haven't been shopping around. Don't take my word for it. Just do a Google search to find some other vendors.If you want to know more about the game itself, search for Tigris and Euphrates over on YouTube - there's a great video interview over there with the game's creator, Reiner Knizia"
5,One of the best.,"I like the way she explains so much about how to create a children's book. I especially like the fact that it is recorded. Sometimes I understand things and remember things better when I hear them. I highly recommend this one. Also, I have a friend who is visually impaired who loves to create stories for children. We couldn't find any books about writing when we phoned ""Talking Books for the Blind."" She really enjoys this book."
1,Not so hot--literally!,"This device is worthless. After just 15 minutes of use, the massage feature abruptly stopped working, even though the device was plugged in and the light went on when I used the on switch for the massage feature. And even on high, the warmer doesn't give much warmth. A total waste of money, in my opinion."
3,"Liked ""Notebook Know-How"" by Aimee Buckner better","The book has a more narrative structure which makes it difficult to use as a reference for teaching. It does have some great examples of lesson ideas buried in there, though. I bought this book along with Notebook Know-How by Aimee Buckner and liked that much better for helping me teach."
4,very good advice,This book gives a writer a lot of insight on how and what to record in a writer's notebook. Great book.
1,NOT what I expected,"I thought that this was a Kindle notebook, to write ideas, or thoughts. It isn't what I expected. It is writer's thoughts on writing and tips. Thats not what I wanted."
1,A Writer's Notebook,"I found this book not very helpful. It was an easy read, but not very informative if you are just beginning the writer's notebook."
2,The Relaxor has good sound but seems cheap,"I got this for my sister as a Christmas gift, but was disappointed to find that it looks cheap and not well put together. The picture looks like a nice brushed metal finish, but it's very plastic looking. The unit has separate right and left volume controls which doesn't seem useful to me. I found that I'm constantly trying to balance the volumes. The clock radio is completely disconnected from the rest of the system. The display is only for the clock and the tuner is the old analog style rotating knob; no digital tuner. The sound is decent, but for the price of this product, I expected something a little nicer."
3,A mixed bag of tricks,"This SHOULD have been a FABULOUS product. It has many realistic NATURE SOUNDS but the choice selection INDICATOR LIGHT shines BRIGHT GREEN into your eyes at night--no dimmer. The easy to read LARGE LCD CLOCK is also too bright at night--no dimmer. The VERY STRONG radio tuner has a minuscule dial that's hard to see, especially in low light. The SPEAKERS are very good--but have awkward dual volume controls. It has an EXCELLENT REMOTE and a distinctive overall design. With a little improvement this would have rated 5 Stars. Don't expect top-notch and you'll probably be pleased for the money."
2,"not bad, a bit crap tho","i got this clock for my wife, who's grumpy as hell if she gets woken up suddenly. When i unwrapped it, it seemed a bit cheaply made, but i thought ""its the non-grumpy wife that matters"".Unfortunately, before the relaxing sounds start (short loops that make the whole thing vibrate), the thing makes a loud buzz. BWARP! And im an idiot because i threw the packaging away, so i cant return it. So my wife (whos grumpy a lot now) reminds me costantly."
2,short loops and feedback!,"this has loops of nature sounds, but they are all very shot (10 seconds or so), so when you have the bird calls, for example, after one minute you know it by heart because it is so repetitive, and it is obvious when the loops cycle. also there is a low hum of feedback that is quite loud when the alarm goes off, which is not very relaxing. we are trying to return it but no luck, it looks like we can only exchange it due to the feedback problem. don't recommend."
4,Great Item - impossible to find another,"This item was given to me roughly 10 years ago and everything still works beautifully. Want one for a relative but unable to find it anywhere. Mine was purchased at Bed, Bath and Beyond but they don't have them either. Sound is good, alarm is reliable and the remote is an added bonus. Going to take good care of mine now that I know there aren't any more available."
2,Not worth the money,Half of the quotes in this calendar are from western philosophers and poets as well. It seems that whatever sounds like fortune cookie readings can go in here. I was quite disappointed.
4,A solid entry in the series,"If you enjoyed any of the previous Romancing the Three Kingdom games, you will enjoy this as well. It is basically more of the same, enhanced with new spiffy new control options.For those new to the series, Romancing the Three kingdoms is a turn based strategy game set in ancient china. It is sort of like a juiced up Risk set in Asia. Romancing the Three Kingdoms is a very slow paced game, if you don't have above average patience this game is not for you. Younger children won't appreciate the game. However if you are a methodical sort who enjoys carefully building and strategizing, you'll probably like this title."
5,Answers Common Christian questions,This book has been passed around between family and friends and I finally got my own copy. It is great for those exploring the Christian faith and for those already totally surrended to Christ. It answers lots of common questions with references to scripture which is very important. It has a great story which can be read and referred to often.
5,"Cute, durable, useful, earth-friendly!","I got these for my one-year-old, and he began using them with more success than with any other utensil. His 3-year-old brother immediately wanted some of his own. The wide handle is so easy for them to grip, and makes spilling less of a problem."
2,kinda disappointed,"I had such high hopes for these. Unlike other reviewers have stated, the tines are not sharp or dangerous in my opinion. Rather, they are too dull to stab most food effectively. They seemed like a great way to have environmentally and health friendly utensils for my kids, but now I wish I hadn't bothered. The spoon is useful, but between the dullness and the difficulty in cleaning, the forks are pretty worthless for us."
3,"Excellent spoon, but a fork?","Love the spoon. It's perfect! But why do they include a fork which is really just a spoon with slots in it? Why not two spoons? Still, happy we got it and it beats plastic."
5,GREAT in My Daughter's School Lunches!!!,"Fantastic! My daughter [who is 5 and just started Kindergarten] uses these daily in her lunch at school & for snacks! She loves them. I use them to teach our daughters about sustainable resources and recycling, etc. They LOVE helping the environment [youngest is 3] BOTH use them easily: for peaches, yogurt, applesauce, ETC.No issues gripping or anything. They wash perfectly in the dishwasher or handwash.All-in-all great buy and will purchase again for sure!"
3,Not the best choice for small hands,"I bought these utensils along with the wooden feeding spoon and bowl set by Munchkin. Had I not purchased the bowl and spoon set, I may have given these utensils a higher rating. The Munchkin set is of superior quality and is easier for my son to manipulate the Munchikn spoon- it is skinner and the feeding trough (the bowl part of the spoon)is deeper and not so wide. In all, he is a cleaner eater without this set. Have not used the fork yet as my son is too young to use it. We now use the Bambu spoon as a wooden teething toy."
4,Great toddler utensils,"I have about 4 different toddler forks, and this is the one I grab out of the drawer most often for my son, age 2. It's difficult to find toddler sized forks with any type of stabbing ability, and these work. The tines are thicker than I would like, but they are sharp and he doesn't seem to have a problem with them. The bowl on the spoon is not overly generous but is also a little bigger than the character-themed utensils we have. They've been through the dishwasher at least a couple dozen times and are holding up well."
3,Fork is pretty much useless...,I'm a little disappointed with this set. The fork is useless! You can't pick up anything with it. We like the spoon but that's about it.
5,"If you like the Victims Family, but this album!","Live recording in Holland. All their great songs, great as all their others.... and a few more.... If you've ever seen them during a live gig, you know you wanna have this album. If you didn't hear them live before, but know their songs, than follow my advise: buy this album....Unfortunately they quit, came back as Saturn's Flea Collar and are now playing under the name Hellworms."
1,"Gee, does no stars count?","i'm am so sorry, but this just sounds like a pre-teen garage band trying to win here. now i know i'm not really big on the early 90's thang, it didn't really get good until 'the end of 96, but i listen to punk and alternative and this isn't it. this is a carbon-copy of other bands, someone trying hard to sound like Kurt or Metallica and really just dying."
5,Fun Game for the whole family,"We got this game mainly for my daughter, but we found that it is quick and easy to play with the whole family. Sure that gives the adults a huge advantage, but it helps teach the more advanced techniques to solving the puzzle."
4,Math nerds,"Got this item as a gift for my brother who loves this type of stuff. An offical ""krypto"" deck is hard to find. Gave the durability a medicore score because my brother thought he should teach some 4 year olds how to play the game...and preschoolers will be preschoolers. But for normal, responible people this will be fine."
1,I WNAT THIS BOOK! PLEASE!,I am Korean. I want this book.But I don't know this book's price. so i'm worry about that. please say me about this book's price. I will wait your answer. thank you!
5,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic product. As a belly dancer it is always wonderful to learn new things and be able to pass them on to others who are learning. This is one of the most exciting DVDs I have seen and very well put together for easy learning, but not for the faint hearted! If you have experience and want a good challenge, this DVD will give it to you. Sadie is a wonderful and brilliant dancer who is simply wonderful to watch and learn from.So, where's her next DVD?"
3,Good only for advanced students,"Great warm up and strength exercises, but the choreography makes you feel like you'll never be able to do that! Not recommended for begginers at all!!"
2,Standard Southern Gothic Romance,"Anne Whitehead receives a cryptic call from her brother, David, while he is exploring a supposedly haunted mansion named Goldengrove where ghosts sometimes sing at night. Concerned, Anne travels to the mansion to discover her brother missing and a curious assortment of secretive people tied to the mansion's history as well as her brother's disappearence.Mary Beth Craft's first novel is a rather standard southern gothic romance with a resourceful heroine surrounded by two mysterious men in conflict with one another. You can tell one fourth of the way through the book who the bad guy is and who will eventually win the lady's heart though there are some twists and turns that show some original thought.A quick rainy night read, fans of the gothic romance genre will only be disappointed that the ghosts spend far too much time off-stage and act merely as unresolved window dressing."
2,OMG,"Thought I was getting a full sized cookbook, but instead got this tiny little booklet with only a few items instead ofwhat I was expecting. I really think in cases like this, the book should be photographed alongside something like a key ring, so that everybody can see the size it is. Really deceptive way of selling this product. Not a happy camper."
3,Garlic Cookbook Review,Simple but easy cookbook. Not very large but made a good gift along with a garlic press.
4,working fine. Nothing special,"I bought this item item after going through TWO of this cheaper model from Osprey-Talon (LAPTOP AC ADAPTER POWER SUPPLY CORD FOR HP PAVILION DV1000 DV4000 DV5000 DV8000). Both of the Osprey-Talon models failed completely within months, causing some definitely laptop panic each time.This one cost more, but seems better made. I'll update if it fails, but has seemed reliable. Nothing special, though. It doesn't have a little LED light on the transformer like some do, so troubleshooting is harder. And they make it work for my HP dv1040 laptop by putting a custom tip on a generic plug design. It works fine, although you can slide the tip right off (it's not hard wired on there)."
2,The picture is not the product you receive.,"I ordered this adapter in hopes of relieving the stress that I seem to put on the plug that goes into my laptop. You will notice that the picture shows a 90 degree angle for the plug-in. This is exactly what I thought would solve my problem. This is not what they sent me. What I recieved was the standard generic plug-in. It works, but it is not what I thought I orderd."
5,works great,"I was a bit skeptical, based on the price, that this would work as advertised. I've been using it for over a month and it is much more durable than the HP version. It also does not radiate as much heat. All-in-all, I am happy I bought it."
4,DVD version of 3 oldies,"This is the DVD version of three previous workouts. It includes Winning Workout, Body Basics, and Fat Burning Workout. If you have even two of these already, it's still worth purchasing. It's the price of one workout, and you get to update your VHS--pretty soon we won't be able to work out to VHS anymore. Video players are getting increasingly difficult to find.Kathy Smith's workouts are always top quality, and her personality takes me in without my wanting to turn off the voice. The eighties are coming back again, so I think you'll get a kick out of it."
1,Scraping the barrel with this one - this dvd was WAY too old for me,"This workout is obviously taken from some of her earliest dvds and you only need to look at the fashions to tell. Not that there was anything wrong with the 80's and 90's, but exercise has changed since then and the outfits certainly have. No one wears sweat bands and g-string leotards over bike pants anymore. It's ridiculous. There are much better and newer Kathy dvds out there. Give this one a miss."
2,Kathy Smith Review,"This is a good tape for what it is. I decided to buy the tape most like the original workouts. This one is useful, it just isn't the change in my workout I really wanted."
2,not practice oriented,"Good collection of images from various methods with nicely identified structures. But it is not daily practice-oriented. There's not a word about important topics such as neck spaces, peritoneal spaces and ligaments, mediastinal lymphnode stations, among others. I found Butler's Applied Radiological Anatomy much more useful."
3,CT images appear grainy to today's CT images,"ok book......not great. ""grainy"" CT images compared to 2003 multislice images."
2,Cheap and flimsy,We've used the older (5 years+) version of these pens and have loved them. I figured I'd give these a whirl and they really suck. They feel cheap and I don't like the clicker. Oh well...good thing we kept our old ones.
5,Classic Teddy P.,"This is the BEST of Teddy Pendergrass! Smooth, beautiful, romantic. Worth its weight in gold!"
5,Bedroom Classics 1 (Reis) Teddy Pendergrass,Loved Teddy Pendergrass songs years ago and wanted to hear more of his hits. This CD was a good price
3,bedroom = sleepy,"I love most of Teddy Pendergrass's music, at least the early stuff he recorded on Philadelphia International. I was less familiar with the recordings he made for Elektra, so I gambled and got this one. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed. I realize the ""theme"" was sensual love songs, designed for ""bedroom use"", shall we say. But songs of this style don't have to also function as sleep aids, do they? Okay, they aren't all snoozers, but I prefer it when Teddy perks up, growls, and really gets into a groove. The material on here is isn't bad, it just doesn't rank with his best stuff. But if you are a fan that prefers the ""quiet storm"" and mellow aspect of TP's music, you'll like this one a lot."
2,PASS,"If I could do it over, I would pass on this product. Between cost then shipping, not worth it at all. The item is almost as small as the picture and it's difficult to see and play... Can't win 'em all! :)"
3,Fun sudoku but not perfect,"I have 4 of these. One I had to take back because a square on the touch screen went dead. I don't have the backlit version, which makes viewing a little annoying but it is usuable.My biggest complaint is the way that it gets ""1 million puzzles."" It has a fixed number of puzzles, probably much less than a million, and it has a limited number of ways of choosing the ""givens"" that aren't specific to individual puzzles. Multiply these together and you get a million puzzles. The problem with this system is that not all puzzles are solvable using deduction. Sometimes you have to guess. You also get puzzles that have more than one solution. This means it is not a true sudoku game.It is still fun and addictive to play. $3 at Toys'R'us clearance makes it a bargain."
4,trophy with engraving,received what was promised in record time. Great packaging no problems. engraving plaque was great! Thanks
1,HAPPY HOUR anything BUT,"If this is supposed to be a children's book, then my car runs on apple juice. For some reason, the author naively portrays the characters as solid representations of childhood when in fact they are weak portraits from a troubled mind."
2,Bad switch,The switch on the inside is very thin plastic and is easily broken. The company doesn't seem to offer replacing this piece rendering my light completely useless.
5,"Seems Great, Haven't tried","Product seems great. Price was much better than dive shop. Haven't used yet, but high hopes. It was shipped quickly and packaging was effective in protecting light."
4,Good Light for the price,"I do not do night dives very often so I have always rented my lights, This light is perfect for the price"
5,Great for the classroom,"I am a primary math teacher and I use these cubes to create quiet dice. Using a Sharpie, you can add any ""text"" you want. The colors are fun and bright; the dice are quiet; and the dice don't roll for miles like traditional dice. My students and I love them!"
2,"Good light, terrible mounting hardware","This is a great light for the price.It is very much a ""see"" rather than ""be seen"" light, meaning it provides good light in darkness, I was able to ride comfortable at 20 MPH down unfamiliar roads at night.However, the mounting hardware is cheap and not even remotely durable. I hit a small curb on my commute and the headlight snapped the mounting hardware and shattered all over the pavement. The rear light was dislodged as well and met a similar fate.For the couple dozen rides it survived, it was still worth my time, but I would not recommend this product to another rider unless (s)he was willing to secure it to the bike's frame with a combination of zip ties and super glue."
1,Terrible Mount,"They seem like good lights, but I lost the taillight on my second ride with it because the mounting system is TERRIBLE! Don't get unless you are willing to tape you back light to your bike..."
5,Love It!!,We turned our living room into a home theater in just a pull down of the screen. We hung permanate eye bolts in the ceiling and S hooks to hang the screen. I highly reccomend it!!
5,Excellent quality,"Absolutely perfect for my daughter in law school. I played with it for a while before wrapping it and it rolls very easily, has great storage space and it's not too big. Great quality for the price!"
4,Quality bag,"I've owned this bag for 5 years and it STILL looks good after all the daily wear and tear it's been through. It even fits (although snugly) my 17"" Toshiba laptop (the kind with the bulky detachable battery). I wish it were a bit bigger, but that's only because I need to lug around more stuff than it has room for. It does tend to tip over when it's full with a heavy load (books, large laptop, etc.) Otherwise, the bag is still a solid value for the price."
5,solo rolling case,It was a great case a great gift for my son he looks like a real professional now very happy with the productthank you
4,Just....really good,"i too saw these guys on accident opening for sunny day. i have to say that they didnt catch my ear too much (cause i was anxious to see sunny day real estate) but they did interest me enough to check out their stuff. so i bought fire in the city and liked it a whole bunch. but as a whole, id have to say that hit man dreams is a much better album. the songs flow a lot more effectively. it sounds more organized, also, where as fire sounds like a bunch of songs put into a random order. highlights includeYour Albatross (killer opening track, for some reason has a zeppelin feel to it), Testing the Model (sickeningly catchy), bad landing (just an awesome riff), and Rebuilding jericho (good, heavy, melodic...well done.)go get it. now."
4,sean p hill needs ta sit himself down,"wait a minute sean p, back-up (beep beep beep) either you love it enough to od on it, or you don't play it at all. If you think its the greatest thing since sliced bread, then why is your ""replay value"" only every 2 days? And by the by, the ffirst time is aan accident, the second time isn't, duh! You better straighten up your act if your gonna be putting your reviews out there for everyone to read."
5,Excellence Comes as Standard...,I totally agree with the previous viewer. It's just a pity that HB and WB won't re-release all the Classic Jonny Quest episodes...
5,nice gift,I bought this for my Sister for Christmas and she loiked it and her boyfriend loved it !! was a nice gift to give
2,powder,"I like the powder, however it was open and obviously had been to someone else. Didn't care to do the hassle of sending it back, same with the lotion and shower gel I ordered. I will be buying beauty products at a regular store in the future."
3,Works,"Not many 3 way CFL's available and this one is well priced. Wired to go low-hi-med in lighting. The second element has a solder ""blab"" for the contact of the second element. The socket contact might line up or it might not. I bought 2 bulbs. One works fine and one needs to be ""finessed"" to come on. For $6 it is a good deal."
3,"it works, but just not very bright","similar light color to incandescent if you're into that sort of thing. As previously noted, it is 13/29/18 watts, so the birghtest setting is the second click. But that brightest is not so bright. I've grown to assume that 11-15W CFLs are 60W equivalents, so had thought 29W CFL would be at least like 2 standard CFLs, but decidedly not"
5,Reading light,The book light we gave to our sister was greatly appreciated. Thank you for offering such great items.
4,Good light for reading,"This is a good reading light . I would have given it 5/5 but it sometimes flickers.Other then that it is very flexible, you can attach to the book cover easily and it lights the page properly."
2,"Works fine when it works, which isn't much","It worked fine for a couple weeks when I received this reading light. Unfortunately after that time it started to flicker, and soon it started to fade even when not flickering.It's not the battery, and the connection doesn't seem to be fixable because even when I push and pull and try to coax that connection back into place, the light will still stay faded, off, or flickering."
5,VERRRRRRY BRIIIIGGGHT!!!!!,Lights up great. Can See to read even in the darkest room. You will love this little but powerful light.
4,Nice little light,Bought it to clip onto my Kindle when reading in dim light. Shines plenty of light where you want it. Need to play with it a little not to get glare coming back off the Kindle screen. Once you get that angle down it is good to go and performs well.
5,Best book light yet,"I've bought many booklights. This one is the first that is bright enough, light enough, and easy enough to direct right on the page."
1,Trash,This product is cheap trash. It fell apart when I opened the package and would not go back together because the parts were warped as though they had melted in the package.
3,"Good questions, but answers seem uneven","I just received a B.S. in physics and bought this book to study for a state teacher's proficiency exam in physics. Though I have not yet taken the exam, the book seems useful for providing hundreds of potential exam questions. The questions span the topics of a three-semester general physics college sequence. About ten percent of the answers seem wrong, though, in the first three practice tests that I've taken. Answers that appear incorrect include Test two, problems 4, 6, 25, 26, and 28 and, for Test three, problems 1, 2, 6, 9, and 10. I note that questioning a problem's answer makes me study the subject more carefully, which isn't so bad."
4,fast guitars and drums and whining vocals make this the best,this album was very interesting to listen to because finally got to hear al jourgensen play lead and he is awesome. i couldn't tell how good he was when i listened to a ministry album because they always had additional personnel playing guitar. this band is the next best thing to ministry.it rules!!!!
4,dks vs ministry =smart music to dance and think about!!!,well this to me is a album that definately deserves a couple of listens to kind of grow on ya.when you have the likes of jello and al jourgensen to deal with..this is really the same concept thing as either the dks or ministry the only difference they have made one hell of a combo together entirely.not the gothic slam thing of ministry or the surf punk thing of the dks but taking the 2 bands concepts and making the both of them work together making more of a groove in your face polital satire that either you can dance to or think to.also with a increadible production sound that will give anyone a reason at first to listen to this album again.so if you like both the dks (jello)and ministry you will definately like this one but you must really be a fan of both bands on this one to get the full effect of this album .thats why i only give it 4 stars because there are very few fans of both bands together.which is a shame!!!!!
2,I can't go satisfaction,"This third album from Jello Biafra and Ministry is mostly outtakes from the ""Last Temptation of Reid"" sessions that deserved to be outtakes. Unintelligible drivel with half-assed lyrics. ""I Wanna Be a Drug-Sniffing Dog"" rips in true DK fashion, and ""Sidewinder"" provides some of Biafra's trademark creep-out ambience, but the rest is lazy. Collage-art packing is great reading, however. But also merely points out the facts that threats to our liberty and sanity deserve a stronger defense than this disc.--J. Ruch"
4,filth Pig is Great,"The editor has no taste. Filth Pig is Ministrys best album. Its slow, but it has such a great sound and great songwriting. I even prefer it over Psalm 69. But now for Pure Chewing Satisfaction. Its Lard, yes. But its not The Last Temptation of Reid. There are no songs as ""Fork Boy"" or ""Can god fill teeth"". Just a few godd songs, most of them so la la (for lard), but good compared to other industrial bands and albums."
5,This is a wonderful book for people just starting off,"This is the only apache book I have been reading, so I can't compare it to others. Its organized realy well. All though this is a dummys book, I would strongly suggest learning the basic commands for unix or linux, the basics of the emacs editor, and how the linux operating system is organized before getting involved with apache. Learning the above really shouldn't take that long or much money. If you buy packaged linux distro, it will come with a manual to help you learn how the os works and the commands that you will need.Mandrake 7.1 and Caldera OpenLinux are available here in the software store, both a very good choice, it will get you up and running quickly and easily. This book is easy to understand and it gets you excited about becoming a web master. Highly recommended. END"
4,Apache Server for Dummies,"This book is a good book for exactly that, beginners, and even if you downloaded the apache software and read some of the on-line docs, you might be missing out on some things that you never even knew about, this is because it's hard to find a source on the internet that explains everything about a subject you want to read about in one concentracted place, instead it's spread all-over...So even if you have some experiance, I would recommend this book and then get a better one later, more advanced.Raymond...."
4,Great for Apache,"Well, considering Apache was written for UNIX/Linux, I would give this book my recommendation.For those wanting to run the Win32 port of Apache, look for a Win32 specific book! There is at least one listed on Amazon ;o)"
4,Akpache Server For Dummies,"An older book at a nice price, but still contains all the basice info for working with the Apache web server."
2,"Interesting, but incomplete","I bought this book for one purpose: figuring out how to add security to my NT-based site. I've read Chapter 6 four times now, and I can honestly say that if you don't know Unix, this book doesn't help you with security issues.Very very simple stuff, like how to set up a list of usernames and passwords, is completely ignored. All of the command line functions are Unix-based, so if you don't know the NT commands for ""kill"", ""lsof"" and ""man"", this book is very frustrating. If it can't be re-written to accomodate NT users, there should be a separate title for ""Apache NT for Dummies."""
5,Excellent ! A must have for all serious traders.,"This is a must have for all serious traders. Robert Ward does a masterful job of explaining probability and statistics, the foundation for option pricing and delves deep into market psychology, hedging, and numerous advanced topics.To truly get the most of this book read it slowly and learn all it has to offer. This is, by far, the best book I have ever purchased on Options trading. It is full of wisdom, explanations, examples, diagrams, and quizes (with answers at the back of the book) to assure you truly master the language, mathematics and psychology of options trading.Congratulations to Robert Ward on writing a great, great book!"
2,"Good, but you can do better at 888options.com for FREE","Okay book. Definately learned from it, but I'll tell you from first hand experience that you can learn the same thing for FREE at 888options.com, which is the industry organization that champions education in options trading.This book is a slow, long, round about way to learn Black-Scholes. I could write a pamphlet that teaches the same thing."
4,nice tent,"This is a nice tent. We have used it three times and have had no problems, even when it rained. We have two adults and a child. It was large enough for a queen size air mattress. My husband wants a tent he is able to stand in, so we are giving this one to our older son."
4,Good Tent,Spent the summer in this tent. Better suited as a two person tent. Also the initial setup is hard. Once the tent has been setup it is hurricane sturdy. The tent packs away easily into the neat nylon bag provided by Columbia.
4,ceilings queen,perfect for two people and 2 dogs or 2 adults and 2 kids. goes up almost instantly. used the rain fly and had no water in the tent
5,Awesome tent,"We went camping for the first time last summer and was new to the whole outdoors experience. Knowing the Columbia name, i purchased this from a retail store expecting it to be complicated to setup and such. I read through the directions twice just to make sure. When i arrived at the campsite, i didn't even look at the directions. It was made with good quality materials and has a good amount of ventilation with the two flaps open on the bottom of the tent. Optional gear holder on the top makes it convenient for calyum sticks, etc. It rained a few minutes while we were camping and it handled it pretty well. Overall, i'm very satisfied with this tent, and will buy another if i had to. FINAL NOTE: Easy to setup, very roomy, clear skylight for star gazing, and built with the camper in mind."
1,WARNING: This will NOT work with XBox360!,Leave it to Microsoft to design a system that will not work with their older games. I can't really rate the product itself because it won't work!
4,Good Workout,"Yourself Fitness is a good workout. It is not a fun game. It seriously challenges you. You take a fitness test before your first workout, and it is tailored to your fitness level. If an exercise is too hard or too easy, you can adjust the difficulty level. You can also incorporate a balance ball, weights, etc. into your workout."
4,Great for a variety in your home workouts,"This ""game"" has been great to add variety to my workouts--it's very cold where I live in the winter, so I'm inside on the treadmill a lot, but that gets boring. This game is nice b/c once you get all the info stuff entered in, the ""virtual trainer"" knows what you need. The workouts are as easy or as hard as you want them, with plenty of opportunity for your input. I recommend it to moms, especially, probably because I am one, but also because it's convenient to do in increments--if you want to do 15 minutes at a time, the game lets you do that. I'm not the type of person to actually watch the tutorial, and some of the exercises are the kind that you need to be taught to do them right, so I improvise a little. I'm sure I look hysterical, but heck, as long as it burns calories, I'm okay with it."
4,"Better than nothing, good companion workout","we have an X-box and not a wii (at the time I bought this). I was looking for a interactive workout product, and this had the best reviews. The set up was long, but it does give different plans and workout, but there is now way of it judging how ""correctly"" you are doing the routine or yoga poses. As you do more workouts more routines and settings are available. I like being able to change the routine and settings depending how I feel and if I ma tired of them.We now also have a Wii Fit. The Wii fit is much more ""fun"" while Yourself Fitness is more of a serious workout product.I like to use them on alternating days or weeks for a good all around but varied workout routine."
5,the aquabats at their best,"this is one of the best ska albums i have ever had the privelige of listening to. I you havent bought it already then you should drop whatever you are doing and go out and buy it right now, you wont be able to control your laughter as a result."
5,The BEST AQUABATS CD,"This is the best cd by the aquabats, and that is very very hard to say. Musicly they keep you dancin. Lyricly they are insanely funny, and ingenious. The Bats also rule because they are Mormon like Orgazmo, and that rules."
3,Hmmmmmmmmmm.....,"I enjoyed ""The story about nothing"" and the ""Theme Song"" but other than that this album is a bit all over the place,it doesnt really stick to one sort of genre,its all mix and match...but o.k"
4,This coming from a non-ska fan..,"This CD is quite original in Ska, not being the type of sick forceful comedy in other ska/punk albums, but wacky and creative. Their main fault is in the mediocrity of the singer, but they of course have great instrumentals, especially since Travis Barker is in the band. It's funny, fast, and sometimes embarassingly wacky. It's good for a laugh and maybe a few plays, but it gets old pretty quick.I'd have to recommend this to fans of contemporary punk-rock or ska."
5,"If you absolutely love ska, this cd is for you, baby!!!","If fun-loving, pert, and happening ska music is your cup of tea, this is the cd for you. The aquabats style is true ska. The cd is acutally parallels a comic book by the group singing about evil villians and sexy women. If you're looking for a real ska cd, the FURY OF THE AQUABATS is for you!!!"
5,This cd rox!,"THE FURY OF THE AQUABATS is a killer cd, it is so incredibly funny and I love all the songs. These are truly funny songs such as ""Captain Hampton and the Midget Pirates"" and I like ""Red Sweater!"" I definitely recommend this cd! I hear that they are great in concert, but I don't know when they come to the East Coast, I think they're from Britain so that might have something to do with it."
2,Impressed but not Impressed,"I bought this tent last year for a motorcycle trip from Canada to the tip of Baja Mexico. We camped every night and on the 4th night of our trip, the bungee cords in one of the poles snapped. As this was the 4th time using this tent and being in the middle of the Mexican desert with nowhere to replace it, I got pretty frustrated. It was still usable but it took much longer to but together and was a real pain doing it myself.If it weren't for the cheap construction, I would have given it 5 stars for everything else, especially the mesh ceiling, which made for some awesome star gazing at night. I think i may pass up on Columbia for my next tent though. Maybe mine was a ""lemon"" or something."
4,Good Tent,"This tent took me less than 15 minutes to set up - I'm a girl that has little to no tent assembly experience! it's definitely for two people with no extra room for ""stuff,"" so if you're looking for a large two-person tent you'd better go with a three or four person tent. there's just enough space for two sleeping bags. Very nice tent - I haven't tested it through rain yet but it seems durable."
5,Very good indeed,"This is a very competent work and a very useful tool for the potential buyer of property in Portugal. I like the way it is structured making it easy to find what you are looking for. It is difficult to think of something you want to know and is not there. There is an excellent section on ""Settling In"". The ""Language"" and the ""References"" sections are quite detailed with pratical guidance and extra sources of information. It is an excellent buy."
5,Great for personal use and counseling,"This book gives you a step by step approach to finding the roots of sexuality. There are many great tips and techniques for counseling others as well. A great ministry tool. I recommend that all church leaders, lay ministers, parents, and teachers read this book. It is one of the best resources I have ever encountered to help those who are dealing with sexual issues of any kind."
3,Overwrought But Fun,"This is a collection of ""optical illusions of the mind,"" i.e., puzzles to which the intuitive answers are wrong. It gives several examples with non-technical discussions but is mostly a framework around the ""Monty Hall"" problem, a classic demonstration that probabilities can be tricky things. The book's sub-title is overblown -- it is not an explanation of how the brain works or doesn't work, or of consistent ways in which the mind distorts reality -- and the author's writing style is hyperbolic. Some readers have seen this book as an important discussion of the human mental process; it is not that. Read around the pretention, though, and it is fun."
3,"Enticing, but ultimately unsatisfying","The book has a great promise, delivers half-way, then peters out. I'd hoped for a wide-ranging discussions of cognitive ""illusions"", but found the book focuses almost entirely on the fact that we can't do statistical problems naturally without training. No real surprise there. Some of the ""illusions"" turned out to be stuff you learn how to do in undergrad statistics classes. I'd hoped for other areas to be covered: affects of social pressure, of vested interests, of faulty memory, etc.I'd hoped for explanations of the evolutionary or cognitive reasons behind the ""illusions"", but perhaps they are not yet known. In any case, the author instead spends paragraphs in bombastic calls to rationality. The book can't decide whether to be an explanation of how we really think or a self-help book.Still, all-in-all, it is a good place to start on this subject; but I'd appreciate a more complete, balanced if anyone could recommend one."
2,Academic With Little Practical Application,"This book reminds me of a girl I knew once -- she promised a lot but never delivered. If you're a psychologist or a statistics professional, you may enjoy this book, but if you're looking for pragmatic insight on how people make decisions, check out How We Know What Isn't So by Gilovich."
3,Too many promises,"This book is a nice review of the work of two prominent psychologists, Tversky and Kahnenan. If you are familiar with their work, there is little reason to read this book. If you are unfamiliar with their work, the material is slow going, interesting at times, but a bit tedious."
2,"Rigging the Deck, CogSci style","I'm a third through this book and I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it. The author has a habit of posing ill-stated problems, then crowing about how people get them wrong when the information needed to solve them isn't available.Too bad; a book with this stated mission is needed, and some of the example syndromes are scary. I just wish they had earned a more careful treatment."
2,A Big Let Down,"He talks a big talk in the begining of the book as of he were about to impart so secret knowledge to the world.In truth the book is short an doesn't reveal anything that wouldn't be encountered in a cognitive psychology class the graduate level.My biggest problem with the book was the very last page where he decides to lambaste evolutionary thought with great fervor. Why? His book is on cognitive biases. Whe would you choose to end a book the that with a hughe dig at all who look at human behavior as the result of millions of years of evolution?I am sorry I wasted my money. The only thing you really take away from the book is that humans aren't very good at intuitive probabilities. But, anyone who has taken a graduate statistics class already knows this.Very poor."
2,to many puzzles to little explanation,"I expected when I bought this book at the second hand bookstore to discuss more so why there are certain logic errors and how they relate to human reasoning, evolutionary psychology etc.The book is largely a composition of examples of logic tricks that defy human logic with answers in the back that make it seem more like a book of logic tricks to tell than others. Other than relating small bits about individual problems there is 1-2 paragraphs explaining logical illusions and it is limited to the rather basic explanation that it deals with a modular view of mind. unless one cares for logic tricks little will be learnt from this book on the human mind, except in particular circumstances. the few good parts such as bringing up bayes law in statistics is given 5 pages and without any mathematics.I don't often read in cognitive science but i am rather confident there is a better book to describe findings on mental illusions than this."
1,Not a candelabra size,"This item is classified in the candelabra section, but it does not have a candelabra base. It's base if for regular sockets, not candelabra sockets."
3,Great for Praise and Worship.....and Exercising,"This CD keeps your heart going and your spirit high. I recommend this CD for Praise and Worship, exercising, or just cleaning the house!Love it!"
5,Here & Now - The Best Yet!!,"Here & Now is Darryl's best CD so far. It is a bit different than his other CDs. With this CD Darryl really shows us another side to him. He shows his playful and fun side with songs like Nothin But A Love Thang and The Party Song. He shows his sensitive side with Slow Dancin With A Memory. He tells us just how he feels with songs like Jumpin Off The Wagon, Living In The Here & Now and Nothin To Lose. He shows his support of the military with I Just Came Back From A War. This CD is pure Darryl Worley and I just love it. The CD is filled with well written and incredibly sung songs. Way to go Darryl!"
4,Here and Now,"Some artists play formulated music that their labels want, some artists go another direction and sign with labels that listen to the artist and what they have to say. Hence the new release from Darryl Worley ""Here and Now"" on the new 903 Music label.From the first track to the last track, it sounds like a party is going on and the fun is just getting started again for this artist, along with some touching songs that will get you right where they are meant to. You might remember Darryl from his hits Have You Forgotten? and I Miss My Friend, but his latest I Just Came Back From a War is rising on the charts. I am lucky enough to have gotten an advance copy to review and let me tell you I love it!"
4,"Love the light, hate the mount","This light was well recommended by others for its regulated LED. I've used it on several night rides through rain and cold. One day, after having it less than a year, I was going down Camino Alto Ave., a somewhat bumpy road here in Marin and the light suddenly snapped off and bounced away. I retrieved the light and fortunately it still works, but the mount was broken beyond repair. After a short conversation with Princeton, originally wanting me to go find a replacement, they arranged to have a replacement mount sent at no charge. Again, this light was less than a year old. I think the light is very good and I do use a high intensity discharge N/R Storm for my 2hr commute. I think the mount is made of poor material or designed poorly."
2,Quite a let down!,"My last Princeton Tec EOS died when the bracket broke and the light was lost somewhere in the great outdoors. I wanted to replace it because it has a great light output and runs on AAA batteries. Handy given my penchant for forgetting to recharge rechargeable battery packs.This one arrived ahead of the projected delivery date but was DOA out of the box--dead batteries! Not a big deal, I have plenty of AAA batteries on hand. However with fresh batteries the light is missing the two middle settings (medium and low). Doing the standard ""quick cycle"" through the modes I have HIGH and STROBE only! I mostly use the HIGH setting but it is disappointing none the less.For a knock-about bike light it isn't worth the hassle and expense to get an RMA from Amazon and pay to ship it back. It could be a fluke, but I doubt I'll buy another Princeton Tec sight unseen. Really quite a let down!"
4,"Cute, but needs on/off switch","I picked this up second hand because I thought it was cute. My 7 mo. old seems to like it and it's easy for her to activate the lights & sound which is a plus, however there is no on/off switch so it turned on constantly in the diaper bag. We no longer take it with us when we're on the go for this reason."
4,This Sondtrack Rocks,"This cd rocks! The best song is lose yourself by eminem because it is a song that inspires you that you can do anything that you put your mind to. The other songs are also good. This cd got hot artist like eminem,50 cent,jay-z,nas,d-12,xzibit and more.The only songs that were not good was time of my life by macy gray, adrenaline rush by obie trice and wasting my time by boomkat but the other songs made up for it.So get the cd!I have the clean version of the cd but get the explict content one it is much better."
1,Poor choice,"If you need to purchase this cd or anyother after they have been edited, you should not make the purchase. Just because some foul vocab words have been removed, the overall theme is the same. I have the unedited version of eight mile and very much enjoy it. The cd is not intended for an immature audience wether edited or not. Buying an edited cd is a futile effort and if you dislike the words, don't listen to the song."
4,"Better with superman,but still good!","Here is my review. I would have gaven this album 5 stars if it had superman. They should have put superman on this album cause the superman video is on the dvd. I dont care cause I have the Eminem show which has superman. And I have the 8 mile sound track. I also have Encore, and curtain call the hits so it dosent mater to me, I have seen all of eminems music videos except superman. Somebody needs to tell what that videos like. So just to let you know, for the people that dont know and think its on the 8 mile soundtrack its not. It is on The eminem show. Well thats my review.~Matthew Baird"
2,SO-SO..........................,"eminem delivers in this album with lose yourself and rabbit run, jay-z also does well wit 8 miles n runnin my favourite track in the whole album. I didnt like gangstarr and i didnt like obie trice trying to rap with venom. He killed his style..........MAcy gray was outta place wit time of your life. dont get me wrong this song is dope but not in this album.....nas was OK with you wanna be meoverall dissapointingly-average..................."
3,This Is O.K.,"I just got this CD yestrday. All the tracks done by Eminem are pretty good except for the one featuring Obie Trice and 50 cent.My 3 favorite songs are ""Lose Yourself"", By Eminem, (which hasbeen getting alot of radio time, ""Rap Game"" By D12 and ""Places to go"" By 50 cent. I have to say, Obie Trice totally messed up the album. I hope this review was helpful to you. Peace Out!"
5,Excellent E-book Edition of a Very Good Book,"Buy this e-book! You won't regret it. Want proof? Get the free sample, which includes the entire first story, ""Carcinoma Angels"". After reading that, you'll rush to get the rest of the stories.I've always felt that Norman Spinrad's short stories are better than any of his novels, and The Last Hurrah of the Golden Horde contains his best short stories. I've kept a disintegrating copy of the paperback for 40 years, and always wanted to share it with others... but rarely did because I was worried about losing a nearly irreplaceable book. Now it's in an e-book edition that is very well done. I was worried about a sloppy transfer to a digital edition, but the text, punctuation, and formatting appear to be perfect. A good job on the part of the publisher, and well appreciated."
1,Olivia Wyatt,"When I placed my order for this book, I thought this book was the text book ---not the study guide. I was decieved by the lack of information on this book. This caused me to lose out on money which I cannot afford. In the future I may not conduct business with Amazon if this happens with my other book that I ordered.Unhappy customerOlivia Wyatt"
1,WARNING NOT THE CORRECT BOOK!!! DO NOT BUY,I bought this book Thinking it WAS a the textbook but it was NOT it was the study guide. It doesnt list it as a study guide. Beware!!!!
3,A Girl Called Boy- not that bad,"This is a kind of interesting book and it's on the easy reading level- so if you're looking for a book for a book report- it's just perfect. Actually, I don't think that a theme of a book is slavery because a conclusion Overtha came to- was that you can make things happen. The things I don't like about this book is that Berlinda Hurmence found a nice title for her book, but it doesn't say anything about its theme and the author could create a different ending- ending where Boy meets all her friends in the 20th century that she wouldn't have to lose them forever."
3,This book was okay,"this book wasnt a great book, but it was interesting. I liked its details, and the way it described things. I recomend this book to everyone that can read."
2,Very weak and uneven,"This is not up to the standards set in ""Nor Crystal Tears"" or ""Into the Out Of"". The structure is poor and I cared more about the secondary characters than the 2 ""heros"". I kept on reading, thinking ""It'll get better next chapter"", but it didn't."
3,Phylogenesis: Book one of the Founfing of the Commonwealth,"It wasn't too bad. Certainly not ""For Love of Mother Not"", ""Mid World"", ""Sentenced to Prism"" and not ""Nor Crystal Tears"". It's no where near ""Into the Out Of"", this book gave me the willies for a long time. These books bring me back again and again for a great read. The ending was weak and I think there was too much ""filler"" about this and that. It was as though it had been a short story then fleshed out for a regular book. I will most likly still get the next one as I like the stories but I can't say it was one of his best or even one of his ""goods"". Fair is a good assement. Try out one of the ones I first mentioned if you haven't tried Foster, he is a great read in most all of his books. Everyone has an off day!"
2,Not Recommended,Phylogenesis looks like it was put together to fill a contract for the Commonwealth books by the author. It has a modest plot and I did not find either of the two main characters particularly interesting. I kept hoping that it would get better and then it ended. Apparently the author had reached the agreed upon number of words in the contract and it was time to stop writing.It could have been a good book if the Author had cared about it.
4,A good pre Humanx commonwealth story,This book explors the relationship between humans and thranx in Fosters humanx universe. Glimpse at the events and pressures which started(or should I way jumpstarted) the amalgemation of Humans and thranx into a single multi-star system civilization after their first contact(shown in 'Nor crystal tears'). The charecters are not heroic types and you get a good sense of their frustration and desperation.
1,ADF - Please try to remember what has gone before??,"After the wonderful ""Nor Crystal Tears"", this book is a huge disappointment. You cannot get into the headspace of either character, neither one is agreeable to the reader, and it contradicts a lot of elements in Thranx society that ""Crystal Tears"" introduced.And since **WHEN** did the Thranx become vegetarian??? In ""Crystal Tears"", Ryozenzuzex eats some meat his human captors/friends provide him, and his only comment was it wasn't in a ""proper stew or soup"". There's a few other scenes in the book where he eats meat as a normal part of thranx culture. Yet in this book, the poet character gets sick at the mere thought of eating meat, and gives the impression that the thranx are natural vegetarians. Come on!! This was just the most glaring error in a batch of them."
1,Designed to steal your money,"I used this program for several months without serious issue. I then started getting an error message ""your computers configuration has changed, you must reactivate"". My computers configuration had not changed, but I reactivated anyway. After reactivating 3 times, I got the error ""maximum number of activations exceeded"". The program the ceased to function altogether. After many hours on the phone with technical support (in India or Pakistan, I was told to buy a new version of the program. That would be like throwing good money after bad. You will be better off without this software."
2,"Is this book really for ""dummies""?","The first part of the book covering installation was well laid out and easy to follow, however the installation was so easy that I didn't really need any guidance. It was when it came to configuring the kernal that I really needed help, but I found the explanations very difficult to follow. The instructions for typing in commands may be clear for anyone with some experience, but I think most newbies (like me) would have trouble. I I really wonder if Red Hat linux should be recommended to computer ""dummies"" at all."
4,A Joy Fielding Must Read,"I have to say I thought it was worth the wait. I have read every one of her books, and this was the best. She just keeps getting better. Keep up the good work!"
1,Depressing Drivel,"I like to read about relationships between female friends. Stories with humor, depth, emotion. So I expected to like this book. But, I found it depressing and very poorly written. Flat and amateurish. Glad I got it from the library and didn't waste any money on it. (P.S. - If you like books in this genre, you might want to read Barbara Raskin, who, in my opinion, is a much, much better writer.)"
4,A Grand Story!,"I'd never heard of Joy Feilding when a friend lent me this book. It's the story of 4 women and how their friendships evolve over the course of their lives. Characters are well developed, the plot is fast paced, and the storyline is mostly delicious. While reading this book, I was reminded of the novels ""Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons,"" and ""Saving Graces."" All enjoyable reads.The plot of ""Grand Avenue"" took sometimes wacky, rather unbelievable turns, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
3,A Grand Time,"This is the only book I've read so far by Joy Fielding. It is definitely a page-turner. Joy manages to keep you interested in all 4 women who become close friends. However, there's just not enough character development to explain some of the things that happen to these women. For example, one of the women, Barbara, is a former beauty queen and obsessed with staying beautiful as she gets older. She has 1 child, a daughter, named Tracey. Tracey winds up doing something really unspeakable towards the end of the book. But long after the book is over, you're asking yourself what in the world pointed to the fact that Tracey would do it?? The answer is ""nothing.""All in all, I enjoyed the book. It's a fun and very interesting ride. It makes a great beach or vacation book."
5,WOW!!!,THIS BOOK IS AWESOME. FOUR FRIENDS FROM YOUTH TO ADULTHOOD. THEIR LAUGHTER AND TEARS. THEIR LOVE AND THEIR HATE. FATE AND CIRCUMSTANCE. THIS BOOK WAS VERY MOVING AND SAD AT TIMES. HAVE THE KLEENEX HANDY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
4,Great Story That I Didn't Expect,"I picked this book up and thought it was the typical 'woman's', romance, trauma oriented novel. I thought it would be a diversion for me until I found a more 'substantial' novel.Well fast forward one day and I couldn't put this book down. It was realistic, entrancing, fulfilling and heart-wrenching.I will be reading another Joy Fielding novel poste haste!"
5,Grand Avenue,I simple loved this book. I wasn't not able to put it down from the minute I started the novel. This is one of Joy Fielding's best books. I believie every woman should have a friendship like the Grand Avenue ladies.
4,Chicklit or mainstream?,"When I picked up this novel by Joy Fielding, I did not have high expectations based on the cover blurb. However, I soon found myself absorbed in this story of four women and how their lives intersected and diverged. The characters are well developed and quite distinct, even though they are friends. At the outset we are told that two will die, one by foul play. From the onset you are misled into thinking that Chris, an abused wife, will die at the hand of her abusing husband, Tony. But this is not to be. All in all, this novel is a good read. I think I'll try another one of Fielding's novels to see if this is an anomaly or is characteristic of her work."
3,Grand Beach Read~,"If I could, I would have given Grand Avenue 3.5 stars. It is a page turner, and left me eager to see how the story line would all play out, though I felt it somewhat fizzled out in the end.Grand Avenue is the setting for four women, the Grand Dames, each unique in personality and appearance. Meeting in the park near their home with their young daughters, the women become fast friends and confidents. The stage is set in the first chapter, as the reader is immediately warned that two of the friends will die, one a horrible death, and that one will turn out not to be a friend at all, a betrayor.Grand Avenue was an entertaining, page-turner that left me anxious for the conclusion and kept me guessing with lots of twists and turns. Aside from the pure entertainment factor, the story also takes a look at the why's behind a person's personality, the insecurities, dreams and hopes. This novel would be a great read for a day at the beach, or to take along on a vacation."
5,Overseas Reviewer,Cheer is one of the only detergents that doesn't bother my children's skin. It was a heavy package but shipped just fine. Cheer helps keep our kids' clothes from fading in harsh water. Love it!
4,nice but steps steep,great buy for heavier folks-easy to use but steps to steep angle for full comfort
3,book,This books was not at all what I was looking for. Maybe I should have done a little more research before ordering this book.
3,Very cool,"Nifty little book and love the info and listed values. It could have better pagination though, it's a little plain. It could also contain a lot more as the book is pretty short. I like it though and it was worth the price."
4,Vintage Lighters,This is a good book for vintage lighter collectors if you use it in conjunction with The Big Book of Cigarette Lighters.
4,Great but uncomfortable,"I think the shoe/boot looks wonderful, got a lot of comments, but I, unlike females am unwilling to sacrifice comfort for fashion.Overall I am happy with purchase but keep my use of this boot to a minimum due to pain.Laces could've been less flimsy as well, but easily replacable.One other thing, the shoe when taken out of the box for some reason ""scuffed"" on my laminate flooring, that one confused me, I thought only cheap shoes do that."
5,"Aleratec duplicator is sleek, fast and doesn't fail often","This Aleratec duplicator conforms to very high standards. It burns DVD's and CD's very quickly. Other duplicators cannot burn discs at the same rate as this duplicator. Also, the problem with some duplicator's is that they have a high fail rate. That is not the case with this duplicator, because it does not fail that many discs. I definately recommend this duplicator."
4,It's all about the possibilities.,"Some of this book is a difficult read due to its tendency to drift into philosophical areas. It doesnt become too in depth, but it is noticable at times. Many of the popular reasons UFO reports get discredited, are eviscerated by an in depth knowledge of science. Trundle presents a strong case for the possibilty of UFO contact. In my opinion that is the best reason to read this book. I am a bit skeptical about some of the individual reports, but other evidence is simply shocking. If you are a believer or not this is definately an interesting read, and you will know alot more about what is or isnt possible when you finish."
3,Not all containers,"This book has less to do with containers, and more about gardening in small spaces. Infact many of the examples are of small plots of land. If you don't have any land then much of this book is useless to you (but interesting none the less).Otherwise a good book - very readable and full of practical information."
1,Pretty but not useful,"This book was not very helpful to me.Most of the book is about making a container garden in a home with a small yard. It only had a very brief two page section about container gardening on a deck or balcony.The information it does have is very poorly organized and jumbled. Trying to find specific information is very frustrating.The photos in this book are beautiful, and if you're looking for a book of beautiful photos this book may be appealing to you. If you're actually trying to grow a container garden, I would suggest this useful book instead :McGee & Stuckey's Bountiful Container: Create Container Gardens of Vegetables, Herbs, Fruits, and Edible FlowersIt's the only book on container gardening that you'll ever need."
3,I DO BELIEVE HE'S A SELLOUT,"old cky2k n cky3 days are over now... pitty. Viva la bam is fun but so predictable and prepared. OK, he's smart n lucky.. mtv gives him thousand of dollars and he can do whatever he wants... And what about his newest fans? they suck n copy BAM (cky, him, turbonegro...). Please kids be yourself!"
3,are you guys serious?,Viva la bam is not the worst show on tv but it's pretty mindless. It would be a little funnier if what Bam did was real. But it's all stage. Your paying money that could be given to your bills or something useful to watch a guy who's really rich get richer by doing stupid things that aren't even real! I got one word:CRACKBABIES!!!!!!!!!!! Don Vito does make me laugh though.
3,bam sux,the only reason why i like this one jus a lil bit is cause they have a one wit jony noxville in it jakass and wildboys is like 10 no 2000 times better than viva la bam steve-o steve-o knoxville knoxville oh yea bam (...) at skateboarding bam u (...)
5,Bam,"i really love Bam Margera. people think he is spoiled, but most people dont know, it is scripted. if you love Bam and Don Vito (sucks about his legal problems) you will love this."
5,One of the most entertaining reality shows out there,"Im yet to dislike a single episode of this show. The stunts are hilarious. I like the 2nd and 3rd seasons even better, so I suggest you pre-order those. The show makes you feel like part of the crew. The stunts they do are also very creative. For example, building a draw bridge and a castle wall for their family reunion. Then brining in an elephant and trying to fit it through the door."
1,BAM SUCKS!!!!!,"The most annoying show on MTV, that's saying alot because there are alot of annoying shows on MTV but Viva La Bam tops them all!! All the pranks they pull on their family was funny at first but after a while it was just lame and predictable. The BEST show ever on MTV will always be JACKASS followed closely Tom Green and WILDBOYZ."
1,Look mom I pooped in the sink!,"The show is funny the first time you see it. The series is the same stuff over and over. Bam and his crew make his parents life miserable by doing really annoying stunts. They love picking on Vito because you have no idea what he mumbles about. Bam and his crew laugh about it like they were in boys watching a puberty video in grade school. I cant believe people still watch it. One epsiode and you've seen them all. Not great TV, but what you expect from MTV?"
1,Wannabe Jackass... Sadly just crap,"Jackass was a great show, and if you haven't seen it - buy it now! Viva La Bam is simply lame in comparison. It's not funny at all, and neither is Bam. He is supposedly a pro skater, but does nothing that any average kid can do on a skateboard.It's almost sad when he & his drop out Jackass crew are trying to make stupid jokes look funny, & laugh hysterically - it doesn't work. There is large part of an episode where they cover their house with lights (4 trucks worth), for Christmas. Nothing funny about that. Majority of all skits consist of his parents as victims. Don't know how they put up with it (guess money goes a long way).Do not buy this, specially if you've seen Jackass, as it'll make it seem even worse."
2,Blah,"The things that happen in the show are humerous...but unlike what many people are writing, Bam does NOT pull any of this stuff or come up with any of these pranks. MTV writers do...it's just Bam's acting that makes it funny...think of it as a sitcom, not a reality show."
5,haters,"Wow, Watty 420 do you know have anything better to do then sit online and find the Viva La Bam DVD so you can diss on it??? who the hell cares what you think?? We all have out own opinions and if you don't like Bam anymore then get over it and find somewhere else to complain. Also if you are going to stop liking him because hes a ""sellout"" that's lame because he's just making money. I agree with nirvna man when he says taht you'd do it too because I know almost everyone would because we are greedy people. Ok enough about you ... Viva la Bam is hilarious and I am so happy the DVD is finally out. I've watched every episode of the show and not once has it let me down. Bam is so funny and the stuff he pulls is so great."
2,CKY this is not,"While the crew from CKY and Jackass are in this show, it is by no stretch CKY or Jackass. Its totally scripted, rehearsed pranks that are so trasparent. Its really sad actually. Out of a 30 minute show, there maybe a 10 second clip that is somewhat amusing, but thats pushing it.If you are a fan of Jackass or CKY, stick with those DVD's. Don't waste your time. Pick up the CKY set and also check out Steve-O's DVD's. You will be happy you did."
5,Awesome CD!!!!!,"This is now one of my favorite CD's!!! I listen to it all the time! Whatever mood u r in, there is a song that u will enjoy! I love all of them!!"
2,I should have re-watched the movie first.....,"After watching the 2nd movie, I ordered the soundtrack. Then I started reading reviews for the 1st films soundtrack and ordered it also.What I SHOULD have done was re-watch the 1st film to hear the soundtrack again.If you are 14-16 years old, you will most likely Love this CD.I couldn't find a single song I wanted to play twice."
5,Great soundtrack,This is absolutely superb. I really enjoyed the movie but this soundtrack seems unavailable in the UK. The Chantal Kreviazuk tracks are second to none.
3,Enjoying it,"This soundtrack is perfect for a light mood. The songs are sweet, my particular favourite being ""black roses red"". I couldn't wait to get my hands on the soundtrack after I saw the movie and am happy I added it to my collection. I'm not sure the men in our lives would appreciate but definitely one to share with the gals."
5,Good cd,New artists and good songs for this up and coming hit moving!! The song from the trailer is Breakaway by Kelly Clarkson....beautiful song!!
3,Song from Commercial,"Too bad they didn't include the song on the commercial - ""Friends Like Mine"" by The Donnas (from their excellent album, Gold Medal)"
5,Absolutely fantastic CD from an absolutely fantastic film!!!,"I first saw the cover of the DVD in my local video rental store, and the title made me pick it up and read the back cover. It didn't look like the sort of film I would usually want to watch, but my gut feeling said go for it.Wow, I'm glad I did. Not only was the film excellent, but I was hooked on the soundtrack after just one viewing!! Next day I ordered the DVD of the film, and also a copy of this audio CD soundtrack (Can't understand why here in the U.K we don't have the CD released?) Well, a week later with Airmail shipping this CD arrived, and I have been playing it every day in the car on my way to and from work.My fave tracks are ""Black Roses Red"", ""Be Be Your Love"", ""I Want You To Know"" ""If God Made You"", and ""These Days"".If you enjoyed the film, It's worth buying this CD. It sounds awesum played on a decent HI-FI turned up loud!"
4,Fun but reflective,"I enjoyed the movie which was a common coming-of-age story full of love and loss, but mostly about friendship. The soundtrack is no different. It mixes fun tunes like the Faders with more contemplative pieces by Chantal Kreviazuk and a few love songs to boot. Overall an enjoyable compilation."
2,Only Really For the Die Hards...,"This album is a collection of B-sides from the bands early days. There are a couple of good tracks on this collection, but overall there is nothing that really stands out here. There is nothing here of what the band would ultimately become and nothing that wasn't eventually done better on ""Mommy's Little Monster"". The worthwhile songs on this CD are...-1945-Under My Thumb"
3,Half Assed,"This CD starts out with some of the most uninspired music I've heard in a long time. It sounds like a kid forced to sing in front of his school and he wants to be anywhere but there. The songs eventually start to pick up in passion around track 7, but it's not worth it to buy a CD for less than half the songs."
4,Baby Grandson's prayer annimal,"The service provided by your sub contractor was superior. I could have purchased this toy anywhere, but chose the ease and convenience of Amazon. The secondary providers helped me immensely."
5,Excellent,"As a long time fan of Kathy Smith, I found Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2 to be exactly what I was looking for to alternate working out with weights on alternating days and the selections allow for one long workout or broken up into sections. Kathy Smith keeps the tempo lively, offers excellent cues making this DVD a wonderful, whole body workout."
2,Disappointed,"The content of this CD was very limited and subject matter was of little interest. I was really disappointed, I expected a better product from National Geographic. Not worth the money."
1,National Geographic's Photo Gallery,The pictures are pretty but the license does not allow their use for commercial purposes. The advertising does not state that clearly.
5,Adorable,I bought these figures for a friend of mine to put on her wedding cake and it was absolutely adorable for this informal setting. Bakeries and speciality wedding companies charge a fortune for representations of Shrek and Fiona in tuxedo and wedding gown. These are far more affordable.
5,Very uplifting!,"Great, fun dance music that glorifies the Lord! I recognize most of the songs from church and really like the funky beat the Disco Saints have added to liven them up. They've also redone the popular Newsboys song ""Shine"" which is pretty cool. I highly recommend this CD to those who love Jesus and dance music!!!"
1,Not bright compared to higher-end brands,"Once painted on a surface, this product is not very bright at all. It is based on an older chemical called Zinc Sulfide popular in the 1970's, which is about 5% as bright as newer glow in the dark paints. When I later compared it to a paint based on Strontium Aluminate from a company called Glow Inc, there was a vast difference in brightness. There are many website's which confirm the brightness difference. There is even a forum dedicated to users of glow in the dark paint."
4,Great stuff in a small can,"I'm not quite sure what readers would look for in a review of such a product, since it seems most would already be pretty far down the ""doing their own thing"" path once they're buying Glow in the Dark Rustoleum.However, the paint is durable, glows very well, and is great fun in conjunction with black lights. Doesn't accidentally wear or rub off like some blacklight paints, but it does scrub off if enough effort is applied.On some yellowish/beige hues, the paint is not visible at all in direct light (save the faint hazing that might be imparted with texture). My only gripe is that for the price, the can is a bit small and goes quickly.I hope that can aid someone in what is sure to be a pretty sweet project."
2,Starry room,"So I get two tubs of this paint to put up a realistic night sky in my bedroom. Yeah sure has a glow, but only after one hell of a charge in a bedroom environment. Sorry Rustoleum, I don't hang halogens in my room but that's probably what would charge this paint to a glow that is deemed substantial. I shall try to make larger dots and maybe that will be visible in the dark. The celestial map is still a work in progress."
4,True glow in the dark product - not just black light.,I liked the fact that I got 7 oz of paint for a reasonable price. The other glow in the dark paint was only one ounce for the same cost. Also this is a true glow in the DARK pain (you do not need black light to make it glow.) The only negatives are that it was not super bright glowing and that it only came in the one (greenish-yellow) color. But I do think it is a good value and recommend it to others.
2,Not a big fan...,The idea of this product is wonderful... however it took us several REALLY thick coats to get any effect. Yeah it KIND OF worked after that.. but I wouldn't purchase again.
2,Glow in the dark,"Does not glow as much as the name. Purchased it to use it with the hands of a big wall clock in the family room. After even the double coat of Rust-Oleum, it does not glow as much during pitch dark. You can barely see it when you have a faint light in the background. Thinking of tripple coating it to see if it works."
1,Doesn't glow in the dark!,"i bought this for Halloween and used it on a variety of different materials. I read the directions carefully and since it said it would only last 2 hours, I waited until the last minute (until it was already dark) to use it. Despite this... it NEVER glowed in the dark. I would NOT reccomend this product."
2,The price is good but the effect is week,"I have purchased this product and applied it to a couple of items like foam-stick-letters to hang on the wall (for my daughter bed room), flash light back end, emblem, bicycle tires, and even I did put some of the paint on the outside-door-step; the result on all items are similar; it works but very week, light; with no light you cannot see it, very little light hardly see it, with regular light it looks white paint.Considering other products reported to be brighter having Strontium Aluminate in the mix, seems an expensive option; the price was 1/2 Fl. Oz. - $9.98 from glowinc.com ; to do a door step or wall would cost a good sum .In summery this product does not work effectively."
1,never worked,"This paint never worked. we tried everything and it doesn't glow at all. next time I will spend some more money for something that actually works. Don't buy it, is not worth it."
3,i dont really know what to say,"have not yet gotten a chance to try this paint out, cant review if it sticks well or how durable it is, your guess is as good as mine. I will say i was unhapply surprised at how small the can was."
3,Needs updating,"The book has some interesting suggestions and has some that needed better research. Overall, the book needs to be updated. It was written in 1995 and many things have changed since then especially items that refer to dollar amounts. Had I known when it was written I would have thought twice about buying it."
2,Too superficial...,"The author attempts to discuss many different practices and as a result does justice to none.I was disappointed in the lack of depth of this book.I supposed to someone who has little or no orientation to meditative techniques, this book could serve as a basic introduction."
5,family history told in exciting book,"Mike Banta's book, ""Conquest of a Continent, Nine Generations on the American Frontier,"" published in 2001.I read the book and found it not only interesting, but helpful in my research, even without footnotes and even knowing it is fictionalized. There are several photographs from the Netherlands and from New Jersey connected with the Banta family.) The author, Theodore M. ""Mike"" Banta, lives in California and invites comments from readers. His email address is TMBanta@aol.com.)I recommend this book to anyone interested in American history and family history."
3,There are plenty of Movies worse than this one,"Fantastic movie, It's about the trials and tribulations of a man growing up in the hard times in the south.... Oh come on.. it's a soft porn about sex. As soft porn goes it is ok, there is a resemblance of a plot... which is an improvment for a movie of this caliber... but when all is said and done the movie revolves around seeing women naked. If you are looking for a good movie to discuss at your next office party, see Shindlers List... If you want soft porn you could do worse than this movie."
3,Beautiful woman...,"It's a soft-porn movie, Florence Guerin has done her part. We expect more than that..... sigh."
3,The only book of it's type,"I have a confession...I am a plane addict. Since I started on the slippery slope with a cheap Grizzly block plane, I've found myself aquiring and lusting for all manner of hand planes including a 200 year old Marples woodie, a mujifeng smoother, and some model maker planes.For a while, I seriously lusted after infill planes (still do).This book is the only one of it's type on making infill planes (that I'm aware of). However, there is much information on the internet on how to make them now. There are far more practical sources of information on hand plane making including Bill Carter's webpage, Sawmill Creek, and Ron Brese (who has an excellent plane kit).Personally, I'd recommend skipping this book, and just getting a kit."
4,Family Fun,"My family loves this game. The down side is you have to have at least 3 players. It is simple, easy and quik. My 9 year old daughter has even learned some new words from the cards. I would buy this again."
4,Whoonu is a hoot for all ages!,"I have played Whoonu with all adults, with children as young as 7 years old, with family and strangers. You learn alot about each other, while having fun at the same time! Whoonu I didn't like pickles! Well, they do now."
1,Misrepresented,The game came missing pieces. Description said all pieces and in box and in good shape. We were missing 3 chips. Annoying.
4,A Fun Family Game,"This game is a fun, easy way to entertain a family and very good friends for an evening or two. It is not one that will endure over time, but worth the few hours of fun it will bring."
5,Best Game ever!!!,"Whenever we have company over to our house, this game comes out! My 10 year old son loves this game and everyone who plays it with him, young and old, teenager to grandparent loves it as well. We get a kick out of learning more about everyone's dislikes and likes and it is a real icebreaker. We have purchased this game as a birthday present for many and everyone always raves about the fun they have had with it. Cranium games rock and this one rocks above all of them."
4,Satisfied,This toy is great for getting to know one another. It works best with a group of folks that are just familiar with one another. It does allow for sharing and getting to know each other better. Families that are close and know each other well may find it boring to play because they would know the answers and there would not be any challenge to the game.
1,Disappointed,"I love games but this one fell way short of being fun. The idea of the game sounded great but when we actually played the game, we were bored before we started. It was too short. And we were like, ""That's it?!"" The game took like maybe ten minutes to play. We played again and modified it so it would be longer but it was just boring. And the winner only wins by sheer luck of the draw - so there is no skill or ability or even thought that would go into winning the game. You could win this game while sleeping. Quite unsatisfactory. [...]"
2,Annotations Overdone,"The annotations are pedantic and not illuminating. As one critic put it, he supplies the reference (i.e. Rainey supplies it) but does nothing to shows the sparks firing.THere are better editions of The Waste Land, including North's from Norton."
5,Decaf: Comfy footies for your musical mind,"In a world of Korn Bizkits, hipless hop and soulless soul, Decaf is a welcome and revitalizing shot of oxygen. The CD simplistically oozes musicianship and songwriting prowess, from a guy who has been there and done that. (Anyone familiar with the unsung antics of Peace Corp knows George's penchant for politics, humor and cow-tipping the sacred.) It's not rock and roll per se, though its influence - along with other musical genres - tastefully permeates the CD. Good as Decaf is, it exposes as much potential as it does well-crafted tunes. This is a great addition to the Fryer library as well as one's own collection. If you enjoy the likes of the Beatles, Trash Can Sinatras and Michelle Shocked, Decaf is for you. If not, you might enjoy the change between Zebrahead and Prodigy spins. Enjoy it with reduced blood pressure and a new sense of calm."
5,"Getting out of debt, and repairing damaged credit","Credit management expert Deborah McNaughton shows the reader how to establish, maintain, repair and protect his or her credit in The Insider's Guide To Managing Your Credit. The first half of this superbly presented ""how to"" book is on establishing credit, including information on the various types of credit, qualifying for credit, dealing with credit denials and credit reporting agencies, the credit application process, and even the use of credit to make money. The second half of The Insider's Guide To Managing Your Credit focuses on dealing with credit problems, working with collection agencies, getting out of debt, and repairing damaged credit. The informative, ""reader friendly"" text is enhanced with a section on ""The Most Frequently Asked Questions and Their Answers""; listings of ""Federal Government Publications"" and ""Regional Offices of the Federal Trade Commission""; a glossary; and an Index. Highly recommended!"
1,Not very helpful,This book is very general and doesnt give very much advice on how to actually repair your credit. It doesnt really cover the different types of credit problems that people have.
1,Would love to rate it but I can't!,I ordered this product from some pathetic third party. My money was taken from my account immediately. About two weeks later I was told that they didn't have it - sorry. I was also told that my money would be refunded in about a month. I tried to contact the third party but the e-mails wouldn't go through. I contacted Amazon and told them a month was unacceptable. They told me there was nothing they could do. I received my money back in one month and will never use Amazon again. Do yourself a favor. Don't order this book or any other from Amazon.com.
4,awkward size,"There was nothing wrong with the map itself unless you are in a car trying to navigate while your spouse is driving. Trying to unfold that size document, locate the next section necessary, and then fold it down to a reasonable size in a compact rental car filled with kids, suitcases, etc is awkward. Yes we could have rented a car with GPS (the map was tons cheaper for the number of days we stayed over there). The only other drawback to the map is unlike US maps the numbers correlating to the Autobahns(the really major highways) do not stand out. They are there, but they are not BOLD. To be fair, this same drawback was true of maps published and sold in Germany about 25 years ago (which was the last time we were there). I would recommend really studying your routes prior to your trip and/or getting a map that is made in more of a booklet/atlas form. We drove primarily in southern Germany and parts of Austria and survived."
3,It's cute but,My cat did not like it. Unfortunately the picture shows a mouse with a tail which my cat has many of those kind of mice and loves them. This mouse came with a feather as a tail and my cat for some reason doesn't like to play with feathers. Pretty pink and black colors though.
1,No Nip Here,"My cat was interested in this toy for about 30 seconds. Even when I filled it with fresh catnip, he couldnot have been less interested. So, while it's cute-looking, my cat thought it was a failure."
4,Not as pictured.,"I ordered these expecting what I saw in the picture...but in pink. However, they have an animal print to them, are hot pink and have a large pink feather for a tail. My cats don't really seem to mind (They don't usually play with the mouse toy they have already with a feather tail)...I think it's the catnip inside of it that makes them like it. Amazon really should change the picture of this item. Bottom line, I received fast shipping and two toys for a great price! I would have given it a 5 star if the photo matched!"
3,Good ideas,"This book was not what I expected it to be. I am a facilitator at a call center. I ordered this book thinking that it would provide tips on how to relieve stress for call center employees; it focused more on irate callers and how to deal with them rather than on the call center itself. It did, however, employ some great strategies that I will definately be incorporating into my customer service training in future classes. If you are looking for more call-center specific solutions, pass on this one; if you are looking for customer service strategies and irate caller strategies, this is a must-read."
2,"Nice tubing, but not for gasoline","This is some nice flexible and sturdy tubing. It might work for model engines using alcohol based fuels, but don't buy it for gasoline uses. I did. I used this to re-do the fuel lines on several weed-whackers where the tubing goes into the fuel tank, so it is completely immersed, inside and out. The tubing in the gasoline swelled up to double its original size! This meant that the filter attached to it slipped off. It hasn't completely dissolved, however and the parts outside the tank seem okay and haven't swelled up, but I am going to replace all of them as soon as I get some replacement Tygon tubing."
3,Mostly okay...,"The faucet itself was what we expected. Very pretty installed, matches the shower set we purchased elsewhere, but the drain piece was disappointing. It it very cheap, doesn't match the metal of the faucet exactly, and the seal to hold the water into the sink doesn't work.It's fine, since it does not leak all over the place, but the stopper is pointless without a better drain system. We can likely make the stopper work with about 50 cents of rubber from a hardware store. I'm not sure I would buy another Fontaine, because the drains don't match. I'd probably buy another Price Pfister or Kohler instead (noting that they are generally more expensive, probably because they match the drain to the faucet)."
1,jason,"In August of 2004 we purchased a ""Fontaine"" kitchen faucet from planetfaucet.com with a ten year warranty. During the short time we had it, we had to change one of the cartridges twice due to leaks. After only six years, the spout was pitted very badly. The spout then broke where the pitting had occurred. I decided to use the ""Ten Year Warranty"". After a month of back and forth emails, the president of the company said he would not warranty the faucet because the manufacturer in China said it should not be pitting. BEWARE of Fontaine Faucets , their warranty is just for looks."
2,So disappointing,"I bought our Fontain faucet from Overstock.com last year. Although it's very pretty, the cartridges had to be replaced at least 4 times. Customer service has been very nice & sent replacements quickly at no charge. However, it's finally gotten on our last nerve & want our money back. I gave it 2 stars only for the nice look."
2,Fontaine Spring Kitchen Faucet Leak,Nice design but after 16 months of used. The faucet started to leak from the head all the way to the hose. I called customer service 800-476-2950 and this number is not in service. Please let me know if anyone know where I can get a cartridges part for Fortaine Spring Kitchen faucet
5,Read this.,"Susan Perabo came to dinner with our book club. She told us her story is created as she walksand wonders what would happen if... .In this book it is ""what would happen if a young teen son finds out his father isn't the hero he wanted and needed him to be."" His father's life is a lie. The father's fallibility and human behavior as a man, once spoken, the breaks and opens the seal of the box in which they both lived. The hero becomes a father who wants his son to be proud of him. The son finds a father he with whom he can speak. I wonder what would happen if my parents were truthful with me."
5,Great Light for the price,"This is easily the best light you can buy at this price. It's bright and the batteries will last you for several weeks on LOW and almost all night on HIGH. I doubt there is another light out there that can last all night on HIGH, be this bright, and cost this little."
3,It's okay,"I have this light as a backup. Like a reviewer pointed out earlier, having the option of both the xenon and leds on at the same time would have made this light a lot better."
3,good light,"I like this light, but there are a lot of things about it that could be better.For starters, the plastic attachments that hook up to your helmet could be stronger. Mine broke off entirely while I was riding one day under the weight of the light, was rather annoying.Then there is the matter of it not really being so bright, I've seen lights that illuminate the entire road, and this one was lucky if it could reach the ground and show me what I was riding over. But cars seem to be more aware of where I am, so that is niceThat being said Amazon was more than happy to send me a replacement, so really no harm no foul."
2,Good....... for about 2 hours,"After reading a few of the reviews that where posted here about the Yukon light, i though i had found a decent light at a decent price. Overall I am disapointed by the stregth of both the xenon and LED lights. But the most diaspointing aspect of the ligth is the battery life. Three hours tops on the xenon. I suppose you can't get much out of 3 triple A's. But i do have a plan. I am going to rig 3 D sized batteries and build a case for them."
3,Great to See Them Back but the Album Seems a Bit Rushed!,"The President of the United States are definitely one of the most unique sounding bands out there and that unique style is more than recognisable on this album. However the quality of these songs is not up there with the original albums they had before their retirement. It is almost like they have been enticed to come out of retirement and written these songs in a couple of days to get an out of retirement album out there in the market place. I can't see them having a big hit off this album but the songs do grow on you a little bit after a few plays. Great to see them back, a lot of the original fans like me will buy this just to hear something new from them but they'll have to put a bit more effort into their next album to attract new fans and survive."
3,More of the same - disappointing,"If you have a couple of other pres discs then you have heard this stuff before. The opening few bars of the first track will have you checking that you actually have the right CD and not an earlier one in the player.The album is fun, as you'd expect from these guys - but I can't imaging I'll be playing it too much.Some postman, poke and destroy, shreds of boa - these stand a bit above the rest, vestina is catchy too.If you don't have pure frosting get that one before this one - if only for big in japan and tiki lounge.Alternatively - Try buying something you've never heard of instead - branch out a bit. Go to the listening post at your local indy store and snag something new."
5,A Great Book,"I highly recommend Dr. Frank's book as it shows us so adroitly how each of us can gain wisdom and love for our fellow man through service to our community. It is also a great tribute to the firefighters and EMTs across the country who keep us safe every day and night (with no holidays off). I would expect that the average firefighter, if there is such a thing, is not likely to write a book about his experiences. Dr. Frank, an outsider like ourselves when he joins their ranks, carries us into their world and helps us see what these amazing people do and why they do it."
3,indifferent about this product,"I bought this stripper for my Lakeland Terrier. I was tired of dealing with hair all over the place and I thought this would help reveal his wiry coat (as I have had him clipped and that makes him softer).The stripper doesn't hold much hair and I found myself emptying it after two passes (and my dog isn't big). Not great if you have a fussy dog! Even after repeated use over two months I don't see any difference in his coat. I didn't want to get him stripped due to time, money and the comfort of the dog...but that seems to be the only way to get that wire again. I was better off with just brushing him or seeing what the Furminator can do."
5,Works great to strip my Norwich,I use this to strip the under coat from my Norwich Terrier and it also shortens the lenght of his hair.
4,"Makes hotter coffee than most and has simple, space saving design","I love this coffeemaker! I have been using this model for about fifteen years - use it at least twice daily and have had to buy a replacement only every 3 years or so due to worn out thermostat. The office I work in also uses this model - it has been my colleagues' preference as well - coffee stays hot without burning and the pot is easy to clean up at the end of a long day! I find the design amazingly simple and space-saving. I don't understand why other brands can't follow suit - most of the big bulky machines out there are ""just for show"" and don't make a better cup of coffee than the Braun!"
2,"Coffe just fine, constuction too flimsy","Just like another reviewer, I had one of these that lasted many years. Pleased with the coffe it made and the durable construction I replaced it with the new model. Now I have been through two in the last two months. In both cases the drip-stop mechanism broke. Sounding familiar? While it can still brew coffee, it makes it difficult to close the basket properly. I am sure there are other brands that can brew a decent cup and last longer than a month."
2,"Useful if you are familiar with the topic, otherwise very dissapointed","A very good article, yet you will be dissapointed because there's not way to see the graphics, so the value of the text decreased (since a lot of reference in it are linked to the graphic). If you are familiar with the topic, you will find it useful, otherwise you will find yourself upset because of the lack of figures."
4,Great job for coat maintenance,"We found this item a pleasure to work with. Quick and easy on both dog and owner. However, it is not very accurate on specific areas like the feathers on dogs' legs, tail, faces. We have Wirehaired Pointing Griffons and these dogs have hair in the oddest spots that also need attention. This stripper does a great job for maintenance - but not for show grooming. We still need to keep a stripping comb handy for tight areas."
5,Great for Cairn's and combination coats,"Will work like a ""furnimator"" blade, pulling and deshedding the undercoat. It works a lot like ""stripping"" or ""carding"", and the coat grows back healthier, shinier, fuller and gets rid of the ""fuzzy"" look. Eventually will look more like breed standard after repetitive use."
5,Incredible!,WOW! Took the undercoat out with no problem. My mini Aussie just layed there enjoying it! I must have combed out enough to stuff a standard sized pillow and his coat is so soft and smooth now. Love this thing!
4,Helps for a Cairn Terrier,"It definitely helps thin the coat out. It doesn't seem to shorten the hair at all, which is kind of what we hoped (we saw it on a Cairn website). It will pull out wads of old hair, we do it about once a month."
3,Pretty good,"Works well for my yorkie-shitzhu. Lots of hair gone and she feels nice and soft.Doesn't work well for my cats. Maybe it's not made for cats? But I kind of bought it for them, so that's why it gets a 3."
4,Not bad for DVOA fans,"Of course if you are a DVOA fan you already have this album. Right? :) Very ambient, very relaxing and dark at the same time. Not all the songs work on here, but when they do, they are really good."
1,Doesn't work!,"This cradle doesn't work! When I plug it into my laptop, a blue light comes on the cradle. However, when I connect my Ipod to the cradle, nothing happens! It doesn't sync the Ipod; it doesn't charge it.Worthless piece of garbage. Don't waste your money!"
4,Great!,These flashcards are great but for my classes the professors just told me to get the info out of the book for the exams because the flashcards are a bit different from the info in the book...I didn't want to fail so I barely used these but I looked over them and the pictures are great!
1,COMPLETE RIP-OFF!!! DON'T DO IT!,"I thought it was 5 sheets of each color. It's only 1 of each of the 5 colors. So with 1 set you end up paying about $11-$12 dollars. Ugh!! Go to the ""Dollar Tree"" store & get them at 2/$1.00. DT even has more color choices."
1,Check out Battlefront 1&2 before buying this!!,"I think this game has its ""good old"" characteristics but really, games are much better these days. I think Starwars Battlefront 1&2 gives so very much more to the gamer's playing experience and to any starwars fan."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In a society that has everything, there should not be too many problems. However, people with everything, are still people, and scheming, plots, and mayhew will occasionally break out.That is where the character in this book comes in. He is a troubleshooter, and has to work out what is going on on this particular planet.You also get glimpses that the Protektorate, the overall body involved with this huge far flung society of thousands and thousands and thousands of worlds, just may not be so nice, despite what they have delivered to some of their citizens."
2,A poorly executed cyberpunkish SF adventure,"Trots out a handful of ideas that were new and exciting in 1984 science fiction and tiredly runs through an old plot without a single convincing (or interesting) moment. Most annoying are the bits of exposition stuck-in between chapters. I was looking for a bit of cyberpunkish adventure fun, and became mired in this dull mess. Don't let it happen to you."
2,It's ok,This book is geared to teens. It's a good book with an unexpected end. The author does a good job in descriptions and creating suspense. You can easily visualize the situation or the place. Not badly written. A lot of suspense!This book is about a girl named Julie who moves to Colorado. Everyone keeps mistaking her for her dead cousin Vicki. She feels she is losing her own identity and is being possessed by her dead cousin.
4,still sounds good,"i had this in my player this afternoon , i had'nt played it for a couple of years and was surprised to hear how good it still sounds."
1,"Study notes, not the full text.","I thought I was purchasing the full text version of the Steinbeck novel and was surprised when this thin 74 page book arrived. It is the SparkNotes study guide for East of Eden summarizing the plot, themes, etc. The study notes were written by Brian Phillips, not John Steinbeck. The study notes look reasonably intelligent, but as I was hoping to read the book for pleasure someone else's interpretation is a poor substitute for the real thing."
1,Beware of Incomplete Information,"Even after receiving this book and going back to Amazon.com to check, I could not find any indication that this is, in fact, NOT East of Eden, but instead a study guide to East of Eden. Not at all what I intended to buy."
2,Very narrow time frame,"The book is limited to English architecture of a very narrow time frame. The text lightly compares past construction methods, techniques, and architecture. If you are looking for a broad and slightly deeper view point this book will not help a curious child make those connections or understandings. I was led to believe this book would cover the full history of building rather than just one narrow slice."
5,Something special,"This is not a single!! It's something special!OK, it contains ""Something Beautiful"". But you'll get the Bee-EP as an extra. AND... a DVD with interviews and acoustic performances of three songs.This is a must-have for the real fans!!!Reinier"
2,It Is Another Money Book,"Networking is the book teaches readers how to make money by using Feng Shui method. However, it's not a good book after I indept studied it contents. Therefore, it's not recommend book."
4,Crimptastic! Sorta.,"The crimper works fab. However the hearts and stars and flowers end up looking stupid, not at all like any shape.The crimper itself is wonderful and I have no complaints!"
3,Disappointing...,"What a melodramatic soap opera!! Lies, deceit, abuse and murder! Holy mackerel - you could hardly keep up with all the characters and stories. Kate and Sam were supposed to be the central characters but they kept getting dwarfed by Deke (what a despicable idiot!), Amber, Leo, Victoria, the kids, Nick, Pam, etc. etc. Not that you couldn't keep them straight - but I found I couldn't concentrate my powers on liking them or caring for the main ones as much as I should have. There was just too much going on. It was an exciting fast-paced story - lots of suspense and good parts. BUT so much happened, especially at the end, that it left me feeling disjointed and unsatisfied."
4,A Treat for Suspense Readers,Karen Young includes an unexpected murder and ever-pervasive sinister mystery in this novel.It has sexual tension too...
3,"Ok for the money, if you don't need service","My cellar needed servicing, as it came with a minor defect (light would not turn on because the door did not match up with the light push lever). While they advertised a 90-day warranty, the service company they contracted with would not come to our town (said he was too busy in the adjacent town) - Haier apparently had no remedy. The place I bought it was 3 hours away or they would've had the thing back. If you can afford it, buy a little higher quality cellar!"
5,The best money can buy,During the black out of 2003 we had no power for 14hrs and when the power came back on the temperature was still in my set range.
1,Mine arrived damaged - seems to be the case with many others as well.,It was easy enough to get Amazon to have it picked up but hard to re-package it since it arrived damaged.
1,Poor Packaging,I received this product severly damaged from Amazon. The top of the box was cut off and the frame of the cellar was bent in several places.
4,greasy crankin southern metal,"cars, bourbon, and pawn shops. this stuff cranks from the get go. hard rockin guitars and power chords borrowed from ac-dc as well as lynyrd skynyrd with some whisky soaked vocals and some nasty harmonica thrown in to compliment the mix."
4,Ancestry Art,"I have looked through the book, but have not used any of the ideas as yet. The book has more in it than I thought it had before I bought it. I thought is was more of a phamplet, but it has a lot of pages, and ideas for scrapbooking pages."
5,Mars coat king stripper,Highly recommend this tool to any home groomer. Very useful product to add to grooming gear.
5,Best Grooming Tool,I discovered this tool by reading up on my Cairn Terrier puppy. I love it... It also works rather well on my Golden Retriever. I had been to grooming classes and shops before... no one has ever mentioned this amazing tool!
2,Crashed My System,"After installing this product and the accompanying software on my PC, I was able (eventually) to use it to connect to my Nokia cell phone. It took a bit of fiddling around to get to work, however. I was able to transfer files between my PC and my cell phone. The problem was that the device drivers caused my system to crash constantly. It was to the point where my system became useless. Needless to say, I had to uninstall the drivers. My system has been fine since, but now I don't have Bluetooth capability. I am running a PC that is less than a year old and am using Windows XP SP2."
1,Not Compatible But Works,This product disappointed me as it is not recognized by MS Windows as a compatible device. It still installs and works but it does give some trouble when it is being installed.
1,Poorly made -- broke the first day,This product worked for one day.It is very poorly made.It does not even have a cover for the connector.The manufacturer made this as cheaply as possible.
1,trendnet bluetooth adapter TBW-105UB,"bought this adapter because of cost and good reviews...product would not download software onto my computer (Vista op-sys)...had to return twice for exchange/refund...use your money on some other adapter, don't buy this one!!"
1,Be Careful,I have vista and it does not work. The company was useless about letting me know when an updated driver would be available. Wiat for the MOGO mini USB adaptop its a 1/5th of the size
4,no driver trouble here,"I was a little disappointed to see that there's no cover for the plug, but the device seems to work fine. No trouble with drivers; it popped in the taskbar of my Ubuntu desktop within seconds of plugging it in, and it receives data from my wiimote."
5,Works exceptionally well,"I've been toying with the idea to link my printers to my laptop via blouetooth so I bought two Trendnet Compact USB adapters. After pluging it into the Canon Selphy ES-30printer and turning on the printer my cell phone showed up on the printer screen. I had to navigate a few screens on the phone but I was able to link up to the printer and send an image in a few minutes without too much fuss. I plugged one of the adapters into my laptop (which did not have bluetooth built-in) and after navigating to the control panel and clicking on the bluetooth logo I found the Canon Selphy ES-30 icon. Sending photos took about two minutes, (and I had to wake the printer) but the prints are excellent. I'm hoping that I can connect this to my printer hub(I have several printers hooked to a USB hub) and see and choose among the various printers when I need a particular one. In effect I will have a wireless printer hub for less than $15.00. (Hopefully!)"
4,okay,"Black holes & time warps is great, it explains things thoroughly. And without complex mathematical equations that are inherent in many books that discuss the same subject. I'm not so great on calculus so this is easier on me. Nearly everything was good, but the reason I gave it only four stars is due to the fact that they include too much history you have to read for pages and pages before they actually discuss the topic of the chapter. The first couple of pages are about how a research group got started or who was using the bathroom when something important happened. And it's loaded with personal history that I don't want to know about. Although if like the historical parts then this is your dream book."
4,Fascinating account of cosmological phenomena,"Once a reader embarks on the journey of discovery through this book, it is hard to turn back. Thorne manages to keep one interested, with each topic and chapter logically following from the last. He uses numerous diagrams, photographs and simple language to enlighten the reader. For example his illustration of how stars of various mass 'die' gives a masterful introductory explanation into white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes in one diagram!This book not only describes complex cosmological phenomena, but gives concise accounts of the people involved and their political and social influences. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the mysteries of space and leaves the reader contented that he now has at least some comprehension of phenomena that everyone seems to have heard about (quasers, pulsars, neutron stars, black holes) but few understand."
5,Fantastic and Fun,"WOW! A lot has changed in physics since I was in high school (1961). I wanted to catch up on some of these changes, and no one could have written a better book for me than this book from Kip Thorne. He has the rare ability to write about complex issues in physics for a layperson. Even without a small background in the subject, this would have been an excellent read, not at all difficult. It was both easy and fun."
5,Excellent read! Recommend for high school student read.,This book basically is quite simple in structure and features no hard core mathematical concepts of any sort. Thorne created the book so that even the most ambiguous of concepts concerning the esoteric field of physics can be understood by almost anyone. As a high school student I highly recommend this book to those who have plenty of time to spare and love to delve into the history relativistic theory and it's presumptions in our 4 dimension universe. All in all it's worth your money and it's non condescending.
5,what a great book!,"This book is simply the best I've ever read.Thorne uses simple explanations about the nature of black holes.He introduces you into the history about the discovery and search for black holes.Sometimes he even focuses on experiences he had, researching the concepts of black holes.The first chapters are kind of history but then they get really better, until he gets to the last chapter, which I think was the best. Talking about time machines , Thorne gives all of what he has , and believe me he knows more that what you could imagine."
3,I appreciate what the series is trying to do. . .,". . .but I believe that the Pentateuch has been given short shrift.I completely understand the rationalization behind dividing Genesis into two volumes (1-11 and 12-50). What I cannot understand is the rationalization behind throwing the remaining four books into a single volume.I realize that the very nature of parts of Exodus, Leviticus, parts of Numbers and parts of Deuteronomy would make a commentary of this type far more difficult -- but there is a great deal of narrative in those books as well, upon which the Fathers did, in fact, comment.I got the impression that this volume was assembled perhaps too hastily. It just doesn't contain the wealth of information that is found in many of the other books.I'll continue purchasing the series, of course -- but this volume does not represent the best of what ""Ancient Christian Commentaries"" has to offer."
4,Good sweets,"What to say!? If you like sweets, this are really good! Not much more to say about sweets. Maybe the price is a bit too much."
4,"nice illustrations, choppy but cute story","When a crow steals a hen's (Ethel) egg and drops it in an eagle's nest, a chick (Dylan) is hatched to an eagle alongside two eagle chicks. Named E-awk, Dylan, like a vegetarian born to a carnivorous family, eats corn while his siblings eat fish, bugs, and snakes. Dylan proves his mettle by saving his mother, like a chicken-hawk-eagle, from the clutches of a fox, proving that not all chickens are chicken. The illustrations are clear and enjoyable, but the text has peculiar asides, such as twice mentioning that the mother eagle's name is too hard to pronounce (is this some sort of hip inside joke?)"
4,My Dog Loves These!,These are definitely my dogs favorite treat. I feel good about them because they help clean my dog's teeth and gums and gives her the chewing action that she loves. She gets one every evening after her brushing!
5,Another excellent book by Dr. Janowitz,"Janowitz performs a real service with his books. Good Food is an accurate, detailed discussion of IBS and diet. It covers a lot of ground so it probably cannot be easily read in one sitting. It's the kind of reference book that you'll go back to time and time again. The index is very well done so it's very useful.Really a well done book on IBS and diet."
2,Not as pictured,"I was very disappointed in this dish. In the picture the dish appears to be black and white, or cream colored. The inside of the dish is an ugly yellow color. It probably isn't worth the price to return it, so I will donate it to charity. Unless you are fond of black and mustard don't buy this."
5,Beading Her Image by Margie Deeb,"Great designs done with a perfect sence forcolor.In all designs ""Her"" is reallyimpressive."
2,Not for cats,Purchased this one and a number 20 to help remove mats from my cat. Products does not remove mats from cats. After spending 70 something dollars decided to just take cat to groomer.
4,There can be only one....,"The coat king is the best there is when it comes to removing pet loose hair. We have a German Shepherd dog and as most know, they shed relentlessly. While the Coat King has not stopped the shedding it certainly has reduced it significantly by removing much of the dense undercoat. One word of caution though. The item descriptions are misleading. We bought the 12 blade and it would be a perfect fit for a small cat or perhaps a toy breed. If you have a larger dog go for a much larger brush. In my opinion the cost is a bit high."
5,First Stripping Tool to Work on Cairn,"I've tried various products to try to strip my cairn terrier. He runs and hides from all of them (and brushes too). But he tolerated this one. We tried the Furminator, and thought it did a good job of getting lots of hair, but it has sharp teeth and we could only use it for a couple of minutes before he would run and hide. The shape of this tool is perfect. It does not have any really sharp or pointy edges, and it hooks up all of the right fur. We've never had his coat looking so nice and short. It's like having a new dog."
2,Gets stuck in the camera,"Perhaps the battery I received is just oddly sized, but it actually doesn't want to come out once the battery is in place. I've had to use pliers to remove the thing. With the exception of now needing to add a set of pliers to my camera bag (doesn't seem to have done any damage but still concerns me that I have to do this) the battery life is good and the price is excellent for anyone on a strict budget. Knowing about the size issue though I intend to not purchase this product again."
3,nice present for scooby-doo fan,"This is a good shower radio for a scooby doo fan. You can listen to the radio in the shower. includes the stuff to mount it on the wall. It's acualty has easy controls and easy operation. But if you want a shower radio with more features, keep looking around. But, you might like it if you just want a cheap radio that's a regular novelty item.really good if your looking for a decent shower radio with none of the fancy stuff.Overall, a great-priced shower radio."
5,Truly A Good Story!,"I strongly recommend my fellow romance readers to read this book, I know you should enjoy it.The heroine in this story is Patricia Ryan, bumps into the hero Mackenzy Carter but called, Mac Carter. This chance meeting involves a community center for at risk kids.In any story that mixes business with pleasure; well you are bound to get trouble in the relationship. But this story that takes place in Florida provides you with aggressiveness, some humor, lots of intimacy, lies, betrayal and unconditional love from a mother and brother. It also has some moments of danger that heightens the story that keeps you turning the pages.I enjoyed the illustration that the author shows with Patricia, her mother and her brother Parker. The characters portray such unconditional love that I believe any of us can feel the love coming through as you read the book.Thanks Ms Love for this wonderful and enjoyable story. I hope you'll consider a story with Parker Ryan real soon."
5,Excitement on paper,"The reading of Whispers in the Night, is not accomplished without stopping and visualizing the scenes, the details are so vivid, Patty's crispness, and determination combined with Mac's strength, business savvy and vulnerability makes each chapter so devouring and the next chapter an anticipation of more excitement."
5,Getting Unstuck,"""What do I say about my faith in an age of political correctness and hostility?"" That question gets a thorough and helpful answer in this book. I believe that most Christians would like to see more of the people that they know ""get"" the message of good news that is Christ's message and purpose for coming to this world. They just are confused or dismayed by the responses that they have gotten. This little book helps me to be proactive and loving and patient, with the goal clearly in mind. Thanks Mark Mittleberg and Bill Hybels. It is no wonder Willow Creek Church is growing. You have helped your church members become contagious Christians! This wisdom helped me and it will help you too."
2,"Interesting, but....","Brigham Young was one of the most proliffic speakers in LDS History. Fortunately, a number of people hand-copied some his his words and we have a feel for his thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, the method of recording his thoughts was not up to today's standads of accuracy. Out of the thousands of purported sermons, this book attempts to take what might be deemed the ""controverisal"". If you are familiar with the body of Brigahm Young's thought, it is actually an interesting book. But if you aren't, the pieces selected will create a distortion. I would have probably rated it 3 stars, if they had picked some other title. It's not the essential Brigham Young, it's the obscure Brigham Young. Editor, All About Mormons Web Site."
5,Flag-burning anthems with sinisterly nasal vocals,The greatest threat to conservative American values since Communism; the Crucif**ks deliver non-stop anti-american rants crafted in such a sinister fashion that your inner rebel will feel almost guilty for listening to them (almost). Corbin Dart's shrill vocals are like paint-stripper for the pathetic institutions of Americana which he bashes; no other artists have the guts to glorify the IRA's valient effort to liberate their homeland. Mixed in are the occasional personal songs railing against a society founded on silicon implants and empty promises. A must listen! One of my favorite CDs.
4,Zen Gerrilla - 'Invisible Liftee Pad / Gap Tooth Clown' (Alternative Tentacles),"Okay, now I believe this is two Zen Guerrilla EP's combined on one CD. Still, it kicks just as good as all their other releases. Tracks that more than stand on their own are ""Chicken Scratch"", ""Slip Knot"" (sort of reminded me of maybe Soundgarden), ""Dirty Jewel"", the full-throttled rocker ""Lipstick"", ""Gospel Tent"" and ""Unusual"". Personnel: Marcus Durant - guitar, harmonica & vocals, Rick Millman - guitar, Carl Home - bass and Andy Duvall - drums. Fans of Supersuckers, Mule, Jon Spencer and maybe Alice In Chains should get something good from this disc."
5,BUY IT!,"This CD is great, with combinations of reall good bands. Great hits from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, 311..."
2,for the record it was given to me as a gift,"This is a okay compilation. the only song that I disliked a lot is the pantera track not because the song is really bad but because I don't like pantera that much. Descendants, fatboy slim, and Fu manchu have the better songs. Loco by coal chamber is somewhat hard to listen to; the ""vocalist"" can hardly sing! This is a great cd well worth the dinero if you are into cookie cutter warped tour bands."
1,they did sent me the wrong item and never did change!!!!!,"I did send more than 3 emails and they never did reply,I dont recomend you to buy from them, because you can lose your money like i did!!!!!!!They did send me the wrong montblanc refill!!!!"
4,the gr8 Indian Metropolitian Life!,From the promos it seems that this movie is about some adventurous trip of a couple which it is but quite an unusual one. It is a movie about a couple which are not going around well n are frustrated from their routine life.Aamir Bashir n Sandhya Mridul are topnotch n played their part superbly. Aamir is such a talented actor n we need to explore him much more. Cinematography is excellent n many a times you feel that a painting is in front of you.On the whole it is a very nice movie portraying the lives of us stuck in the rat race n ignoring all other aspects of life including our families.
5,The Live Tracks are the Best Part.,"Hey I was there when they recorded the live tracks. Those are the best parts, too. It was a lot of fun. When are you under thirties gonna stop imitating stuff that happened over two decades ago and think up this good but new and different? It's worse than those long haired pot smokers in my high school who tried to relive the sixties. At least they were only ten years too late."
5,Slammin to the oldies,"I must rock every time I hear one of the tunes on this album. Many, many happy memories of sweat-soaked delirium (it gets rather warm here in TX--perhaps you didn't know?). These guys, and the Big Boys (RIP Biscuit), made the 80s livable for me.Gary Floyd has an unforgettable voice-raw, pissed, powerful.If you like this, check out Poison Idea"
1,Overly Self Indulgent,I was very disappointed with this CD and find the choice of songs and orchestration very self indulgent. The musical arrangements are over the top attempting to be some sort of jazzy cool while only being boring. Please stick to show tunes Betty as this is not entertaining at all
5,One of the best electronica.,"I had asked one of my friends to buy this cd. It is by far one of the best electronica albums I have heard. I cannot stop raving about this album. It is one of those rare albums where every track in itself is a masterpiece and shows the diversity of their music. The industrial god fathers have done it again. Except this time they mostly weave melody with drum and base or I should say around it.I have always considered Test Dept to be one of the best percussions oriented (electro/industrial) band. It is their unique ability to beautifully and seamlessly meld industrial, tribal, middle eastern and indian elements in their music that separate them from most other acts. Tracks that standout are Atlantis, 2Ghettos and Miotica. While this doesn't sound anything much like the earlier Test Dept, I must admit that I like the way this band has evolved. Also check out Totality which also is another fantastic album."
4,Gotta Be Smarter Than The Blender,"This Margarita Blender works just fine if you don't ask it to do more than it is designed for. If you want to spend $200....$300....$400 or more for an industrial mixer that will crush ice like nothing, go for it. Just use your head, and this will work fine.....looks good on my home bar, too.If you caught an edge of your carpet in the vacum cleaner and just let it spin, what would that smell like? Hot motor? Duh..."
5,Absolutely incredible,A modern classic.One of the most epic and amazing set of illustrations ever created. Literally a jaw dropping experience (especially as you get into the later volumes). I actually saw the movie first about 10 years ago and just read the mangas this past year. I've read a lot of comics and graphic novels but as far illustrators go Otomo is at the top of the heap when it comes to action and architecture. The movement and scale you feel with his work is just far above what you see with most comics.A brilliant piece that will continue to stand the test of time. Just a staggering output from Otomo.10 stars would be more suitable.
5,The best Graphic novel ever!!,"Gosh let me tell ya, Akira has one of the best and coolest storylines I have ever seen. I am so glad i got a copy of the first volume. I can already tell that this series will greatly surppass the movie in all areas. There will be 6 volumes so don't be surprised if you really understand it too well. more information will come later in other volumes. I cannot recommend this series enough. You have to read it yourself to understand. I love AKIRA!"
5,Akira Rocks!,"Akira is one of the best Mangas I've ever read, the amount of detail in Otomo's drawings is scary, this edition is great, softcover 350 pages its a bargain, great reading for mature audiences."
5,great!,"I first came to Akira because i'm a big fan of the anime film, I was happy to find that this is just as good (maybe better) and also fairly different so it is not just a repetition of what I had seen on screen. A great Read!!"
4,pop rocking!,"tullycraft's CD ""Beat Surf Fun"" is making the cool air of winter blow away and reminding me of warm weather ahead! This is such a front to back good record, each song really compliments the next, from fast numbers, to mid-tempo, and some real sweet slow songs, it's gonna make my compilation CD's fill out nicely! I've been playing the CD in my car on the way to work, and I swear it puts me in such a good mood(and I need it!). This record would make a great gift to that indie popster friend of yours that you are wondering what to get them, it is going to be a classic, on the sublime tip!"
1,"Ordered a new one, but get an used one","I ordered a ""new"" record from this seller, and got an apparently ""used"" one.The cover of the record has wrinkles and dings on it.Plastic cover also was not clean as well.I decided to keep it instead of refund it. But just because it's such a hassle."
5,A must have for any poetry-lover!,"That's right, any poetry-lover. The poems in this collection reflect truly universal themes that anybody can relate to. This is a collection of nothing but masters of the art of poetry. From Beats to Surrealists to Confessionalists, it's all here (and not just for queers)."
5,A very helpful resource for parents of children with Autism,"I definitely recommend this book to help parents learn about video modeling for children with Autism. The book has guidelines for putting together a video, along with a variety of topics that are able to be taped. Sometimes, parents are a bit intimidated by this process, but it is very well worth the effort and easy to do once you get stated. Video modeling has proven successful for a lot of children with Autism. This book will certainly help in this process. A very good guide, especially for those new to this concept. Thank you."
5,"What Fulghum is to Kindergarten, R.L.H. is to Douglas County","As a Douglas County transplant and an English teacher, I relished both Heilman's depictions of life and livelihoods as well as recognized his elevation of the spirit and humanity of this portion of the globe.One may compare the witty short-takes of Robert Fulghum's ""Kindergarten"" series and Norman McClean's ""River"" collection to that of Heilman's ""Over-stories"".This collection of writings is refreshingly simple backwoods as well as elevated highbrow. It is both for and about life, as one man has experienced it, told in such a way as to be universal in its appeal and understanding.I use these stories in my classes to bring the world my students live in within the walls of academia. If nothing else, then to show them that it is possible to enjoy and recognize the beauty of something even when you feel you are surrounded bynothing at all."
4,nice writing never skips or smears,"I do a fair amount of writing, and I like the quality of the ink.neatness counts, I will buy again."
1,too self absorbed,I find this writer too self absorbed which reflects on his never ending poems. I feel as if I am struggling to reach the end of the poem and find the point which in my opinion the point being all about his ego. I also feel the journey through the work is akin to a retro experience I had back in the 70's while in my hippie days Creative Writing class...
5,Great Series - Great Music,"The series is amazing, and Barrington has done an incredible job with a very moving score. Tracking down each of the classical pieces could be difficult, but this CD set brings many of the pieces heard during the series into one convenient place. You get a little of everything. True, it's only one movement, or one air, or one adagio from a complete work. But if you like the work that much, you can always get the complete work later on. I was sorry to see ""Morse"" end, but glad that I can still enjoy the music."
5,JUST TRIP......DANG!!!!!!!!!,"JUST TRIP PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP. GET TORE DOWN AND HAVE A GOOD TIME...DEFINATELY A CLASSIC...METAL RIFFS, ACCORDIAN, SONGS ABOUT GOING ON HARMONY JOY RIDES TO MEXICO AND TO THE FURTHER RECESSES OF YOUR POOR MANGLED MIND. OH- AND JELLO BIAFRA DOES A CAMEO ON WILLIE NELSON'S ""STILL IS STILL MOVING TO ME""...THIS IS JUST OUT THERE."
4,Purchase reivew,This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Since it was on the intended recipients gift list I'm sure it will be well liked.
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"You JUST can't make this stuff up. This is an insane, wild-ride through this (probably barking-mad) lady's delusional (or not) run-in with the Mormons and the British tabloid press. Unexpectedly riveting and surprisingly entertaining. Rented it in HD and totally worth it."
5,Tabloid,"When is an Errol Morris documentary ever uninteresting? The acclaimed filmmaker has been crafting award-winning docs for decades now, and Tabloid, proves he still has what it takes. Of course, it certainly helps if your subject is Joyce Bernann McKinney, the former Miss World contestant with a colorful past who turned up in the news again when a woman going by the name of ""Bernann McKinney"" traveled to South Korea in 2008 to have her pet dog cloned. As chronicled in Tabloid, McKinney was previously tied to a 1977 investigation in which a Mormon missionary living in Surrey, England alleged that McKinney kidnapped him, chained him to a bed, and raped him. Tabloid isn't Morris's most thought-provoking work, but it's nevertheless a smart, spirited, and engaging look at tabloid culture and one very fascinating woman, and that makes for a solidly entertaining film."
4,Good product with a little defect,"we like the massager a lot, especially my husband, he uses it almost everyday. Eveything is good except the remote, it never works from day one, we called and was told that we would get a replacement, but it never came and we called again, and we were told that it was back order. Well we are still waiting. Even though without the remote control, we still like the massager.Ok, a day after I sent in the review, I got a new remote in the mail.And it works! Now we really like it."
3,Not bad...,"I bought this for $40 and still have doubts about it.I got this from Discovery Channel Store. Initially I didn't like it too much, because it tickled me to no end. The more I use it, though, the more I like it, but it is still FAR from being as good as the foot/calf massagers you'll find at places like the sharper image.I'd pay 30 dollars for this, but not 40, and definitely not 80.It kneads and pokes, and rolls, but the speed is too fast (eventhough there are two speed settings on mine) and I wish the motions can be more realistic.No real complaints, though, aside from the fact that the rollers feel hard and edgy, and the speed is too fast. The product would be much better if it's slowed down with larger movements."
3,Not what I expected,"It does an ok job of massaging your feet but not that great. And it really tickled me at first until I got used to it. So if you are ticklish, beware!The forward and reverse don't seem to make much of a difference, that I could tell. If it had a vibrating massage it would be a lot better than just the rollers."
3,"good illumination, but bad switch lock","The plastic trigger lock broke on my first dive, so I have to be very careful not to leave the light on accidentally. On the plus side, the illumination on a night dive was great."
5,"Great, but not at this price",I bought this exact fridge at Sam's Club for $100. It's a great fridge; holding up great in my dorm room.
1,two came and went,"We ordered this for a spare fridge and it would be a great size, but the first on came and it was damaged. It looked like it had been dropped. Then I called Target. They did great taking care of getting us another on. Only the second came today and it was also dropped from a truck. The back was dented and it was already rusting. so I think we will try some where else for this item."
1,Returned Danby,"I tried twice, and both the original and the replacement were delivered damaged, so they were returned. Amazon/Target was good about returning the merchandise and refunding my money."
5,classic,"This is my beloved Herbie right after he left Miles and right before becoming an herb in the fussion stew. This is probably the most dense music he ever made--all those years at Blue Note and he never used horns with this thickness.Nothing really stands out in the band, but that is the point. The music on Prisonor is about layers and layers of clouds. The horns and the panio mesh completely, and you really have to listen, many times. Over these listens, the Prisonor penatrates.This is also Herbie's darkest. Martan Luther King had just been killed, and no one had the race tiger by the tail. Things were getting increasing militant--understandably so.It was pretty dark out there in 1969, and the music here personifies this.After this, Herbie moved to the jubulant funk ofFat Albert Rotunda. As if to prove even potential insurrection would not keep this happy master worried for too long."
4,They're not the Spice Girls!,"While most people may know Precious as the group Atomic Kitten's Jenny Frost ""used to be in"", the 5 piece UK act was for a brief period poised for huge success. With their debut single and Eurovision entry ""Say it again"" the girls immediately hit the UK top ten. However, after a year of issuing a string of moderate performing singles and not quite catching on in the public's eye, it was time to call it a day. Which is a shame actually as the album features a fantastic mix of dance/pop/and RnB. Stand out tracks are ""count the minutes"", the britney-esque ""rewind"", and PWL inspired ""stand up."" This album includes all their single releases and enhanced videos. Fans of the PWL or Cheiron sound won't be disappointed-something for everyone. REcommended!!"
4,Precious Delivers Good Pop Music on Self-titled Debut,"British pop fanatics will agree that Precious is a girl group that has talent…and looks. With four hit singles: Rewind, Say It Again, New Beginning, and It's Gonna Be My Way, the cd is filled with music worthy of a listen or two, and several of the songs keep you coming back for more. Tracks like Heaven with You and I Count the Minutes are true pop by formula standards, but trust me you will be humming them on the way to work. Think Bananarama mixed with Spice Girls and All Saints and you have the flavor of the music.The cd is certainly worth purchasing. I previewed some of the tracks on the Precious web site at ... On the down side, it is a shame that this short-lived girl group is no longer together. But fans can hear the talent of Jenny as the newest addition to Atomic Kitten. Also, since the cd is hard to find, expect about a 30-day delivery delay."
4,Good but not great.,"Although this DVD is not great, I would still recommend it to anyone. It is clear and shows several good moves that my wife and I have added to moves we learned in other lessons. Can't beat the price either."
4,"Tricks of the Trade: From Best Intentions to Best in Show, Revised Edition","Good book, easy to read with plenty to learn for the beginner to the more advanced handler. This will be a book that I will read again, there is so much to get out of it that I expect to continue to pick up more each time I read it."
2,Not as helpful as reviews suggest,"I purchased this book based on reviews suggesting that this is the one book to get if you are a novice in the conformation ring. It is definitely not that. It is maybe a good book for a novice breeder who is intending to also show their first prospect - and who may be clueless about how to identify a good foundation stock puppy. Much of the book's substance is how to identify a prospect and then how to proceed as a breeder - like advertising, etc. Very little of the book helps a notive/intermediate handler actually do as the title suggests - from best intentions to best in show. It is not very helpful for people who already know how to get a good puppy, know the basics of stucture and how to do basic grooming and care, but would like to learn the basics of showing and the stepped up demands of grooming."
2,iffy,"So I read another review that said the stop watch was shipped with a dead battery, but thought it was a fluke. I ordered 13, 6 of which the batteries were dead upon arrival and one the buttons did not function. 6 for 13 working on initial order. Returned those 7 and got 3 that worked. Finally, Amazon was tired of sending me defective merchandise and refunded the money. SO be warned that you may get a non-functioning or a dead battery.The working ones work fine. They do not beep when the buttons are pushed in case that is a feature you are looking for...or feature you would not like in a stop watch."
3,I should have read the reviews.,"The stop watch appears to be very nice, but the batter was dead when I received it. It says the battery lasts for 18 months. Does that mean this item has been on the shelf for over 18 months? Not great."
1,Didn't work at all,"The item arrived not working, I replaced the battery but no luck, it just doesn't work. Other reviewers seem to be happy with this, but the one I received was a piece of junk."
4,Self taught,Great book so far. Im half way through it. The book is great for teaching how to make your first game. All your question on how do you do that gets answered in the first 8 chapters. I know 8 chapters seems alot but... They go very quick and the code examples take up most of the chapter. The beginning 8 chapters show you how to develope your game using vb6 function and api calls. Which is great if you dont want to program in Directx. But im glad he explained this because it helped alot on how everything works. I'm gettin ready to start the directdraw chapter 10 and i can't wait. I give a 4 cause some of the code he creates he doesn't explain everything it does. Also so far his source code is original and works fine for vb6 (on cd).
3,"Good information, however it's a little dated","This book, came out when the original xbox came out. So the information and code are a little dated. Personally, I think they need to come out with a visual basic@net version of the book.However, I am giving this book a 3, because it has some good ideas. You'll get an idea of the things you can do. One thing I especially like is the multiplayer game in the example section."
2,Missed the Mark,"Admittedly I am a novice, but it seemed to me that the author spent way too much time and space on old, outmoded ways of graphics programming and not enough on current 3D methods. The coverage on the 3D seemed spotty and ""jumped around"" a lot. His style is personable but there seem to be a lot of unexplained gaps. Maybe VB does work, but when I consider the time I spent on refreshing my VB skills and then plowing thru this book, I wish I had bitten the bullet and done the C++ route with another title."
3,"Good Reference, However...","This book is in fact a good reference, but I hit snags trying to run the sample code. I have Visual Studio .NET and I love it, and thought that this book would be a good starting point for game programming. And it was until I hit the first program ""ChunkyPixels"" I put the code into the VB.NET IDE and it would not compile. The examples are all writen in VB 6.0 and has no compatibility with VB.NET. So, in conclusion, if you want a good reference and do not have VB.NET, buy this book, but if you have VB.NET you are, as am I, out of luckPS IF anyone knows of any websites that would have updated code samples, I would be happy to hear where! :)"
5,"Not Only a Great Book, Great Resources","This is an excellent book. It not only covers DirectX, but also covers many aspects of the theory of game programming. While it does cover Direct3D, 2D is covered more. Covers all aspects of DirectX including DirectDraw7 (this is the only thing covered from DirectX7, but DX7 and DX8 can be used together, which is also covered), Direct3D, DirectMusic, DirectSound, DirectX Graphics, and so much more! Also, it comes with a game library on the CD so you can get to work on a game right away! Overall, it's an excellent book and a great resource for anyone looking to make games in Visual Basic!"
5,Bleem!,"Overall a great game! This has the added advantage of keeping fewer wires around the house for pets and kids to tangle themselves in. It plays my favorite games on my PC, and I'm able to travel with it, which makes Playstation an excellent idea for travel entertainment. I was very put-out when Connectix lost."
4,"Good, but only if you have a new computer","I first got bleem! on a 200MHz system with MMx and a 16MB 3Dfx card. It didn't do ANYTHING. I thought it was garbage. So anyway, a couple years pass and now I have a Presario (566MHz Intel Celeron, 64MB RAM, no 3D acceleration - yet). So I decide to give it a whirl. It worked perfectly in the demo not regarding demo limitations. I had canned the original long ago. Anyway, I had games that were scratched to hell that worked because the CD reader in a PSX is garbage compared to what I have in my PC. It's my conclusion that bleem! works only on new computers (1999 and newer). Furthermore, I would like to add that if you were given the choice between a PSX and a new computer on one of those committment deals, I would say get the PC because it has bleem! and it does so much more than a PSX.Too bad it doesn't support Gameshark :)"
1,Tex,"I bought Bleem! and was pleased in the beginning with the product. Updates came often, and a plenty. Now, it's been months without an update, and no explanation as to why. When I complained, they promised an article was about to go up explaining those things. It never happened. I've abandoned the product now, as there's no support left for it. Don't buy it. You won't have much support, and so, you won't see the improvements promised for your favorite games either."
1,What no more updates?,"What the people who praise this POS software bundle don't tell you is that there hasn't been an update to download for over a year, and there probably won't ever be another one! The TRUTH is that it only runs a few games... None of which anywhere on par with a real PSX!It's a complete waste of money unless your some techhead who wants to marvel at it's shortcomings! Get Conectix VGS if your looking for a Playstation emulator on PC! ...What good is 3d card capabilities if it doesn't run any games to begin with?"
3,"Decent Product, Demanding System Requirements","The product seems to work well. As far as I can tell, most of my games run on it without any major glitch but... They all run unbearably slow.My system is running at 466 Mhz, 128MB RAM, and a Diamond Viper V770 Ultra, so your milage may vary."
2,"If your processor is say, 900MHz, maybe its worth it","Bleem! for PC is a program which allows you to ""play"" Sony PlayStation games. However, if your computer isn't EXTREMELY fast with a killer 3D card, this isn't worth it. Even the games with the most simplistic graphics move at a really slow pace (my computer is a 600MHz Pentium 3, mind you). And the graphical enhancement ranges from none to ""that looks great!"", but when the frame rate is as slow as it is (20-25 fps if you're lucky) it's not worth it. Go out and buy a PlayStation if you really need to play PSX games that badly. This program blows."
3,"So, far the worst spidey game ever made","This game is so hard i can't even get past Gambit's level even if my life depended on it, but the best part of this game is that you get to play Spider-Man and three X-men Characters, Like Cyclops, Gambit & Storm. This is one of the fewest game that you get to play Gambit in. This is an okay game, But if you like really hard games this one is for you.If you liked this game then check out all of the spider-man games."
3,Terrible game.,"There is nothing to really do in this game. If you can manage to get past the first level, the rest of this game sucks too so really, there's no reason to get this. Don't do it unless you want to spend about an hour frustrated and eventually just quitting."
1,You won't be able to ansewer these questions either,"hey spidey, why are your powers limited? huh, why can't you jump high? huh, Why do you die so easily? huh, Why are you so small? huh, why are your graphics so bad? huh, Why do you move so slow? huh, WHY? WHY? WHY?hey x-men, what happened? huh, I thought you guy were super heros."
2,Better buy this one in a store.,"I bought this for use at a remote cabin in Alaska. The shipping packaging looked good so I left it in the packaging and flew down to the cabin without looking at the condition of the thermometer - mistake. Once there I found the thermometer had separation in both sides of the mercury column AND the blue indicator rod on one side had moved to the top of the glass and outside its guide channel. I couldn't re-integrate the mercury column nor could I get the indicator rod back into its guide channel. I see in other reviews that the problem is not uncommon. I haven't tried centrifugal force yet and the thing is still at the cabin. Point is that I received it in a non-functional state. Presuming that the problems occurred during shipping, I'll recommend that you buy these at a store if you can so you can inspect the columns prior to purchase."
2,Looks nice - Temps do NOT agree!,"Bought this recently & mounted outside. While the min-max feature is nice, the two CURRENT readings differ by 4 degrees F (or more). This seems crazy! Have tried to contact Taylor two time through their web site to ask if this is ""normal"" or do we have a thermometer that lacked the proper quality control. To date, there has been no reply from Taylor. They clearly do not care to support the products that have their name on them."
4,"Great for feet, not for back",This product works well to soothe and relax my feet but when used against my back I end up pushing buttons and changing the settings without meaning to. I haven't found a better product for my feet.
4,"Overall good, but...","Overall, it is a good massager, and cooling unit is very effective.However, two problems I have with it...First, the foot pads are too close for those of us with big legs :-)Also, if using as a back massager, the location of the buttons are such that it is VERY easy to accidentally switch the unit off when leaning back.These issues aside, I am happy with the unit."
5,What a Relief!,I have very sore feet and cramps in my leg. I found this massager the answer to my problems.. It gave my feet a great workout..getting the blood working in my legs too!I loved mine so much...I bought a second one for my parents for Christmas and just recommended it to a friend!Thankyou!
4,Great Cookbook,Gave it four stars because I had to air the book out due to puke like odor. Love the recipes. Love Isaac Hayes may he rest in peace.
1,"ok game, but not worth a purchase.","this game was decent back in the day, but not even worth playing now a days. 2 star."
4,The Epic Continues.....,"Katsuhiro Otoma's epic of post World-War III Japan continues in this full-throttle, non-stop-action chapter.Akira Book 2 starts out with Kei and Kaneda in the clutches of the mysterious Colonel, while Tetsuo continues to test the limits (If there are any...)of his newly discovered powers. Meanwhile, under the crater at ground zero, Akira begins to awaken...Akira is the Comic-Book equivalent of an epic action movie. The art is clear and crisp, and the amout of detail in every panel is staggering. I've never been a fan of ""Manga"" (Japanese Comics), but the work of Katsuhiro Otomo (The Akira books, and the amazing Domu) are winning me over. The opening of the book has an in-depth recap for new readers, and the first few pages are in color.The black-and-white art really looks great, and the book is a great value at 288 pages. Try it...you'll be hooked!"
5,"""LET'S DO IT!!!!""",Definitely better than the movie and much more to read on. A must read for Manga Heads and Anime fans. This book was hard to put down along with the other issues revolving this storyline.
4,"Interesting, creative, and easy on the eyes (to some degree)","Something is definitely lost in the black and white drawings, which are nonetheless still quite impressive. The beauty and complexity of the city that we see in the film is stifled by the format. However, people turned off by the usual kid-like anime style will find a refreshing change here.The story really starts to pick up in this volume, so much so that I scoured local bookstores hoping to find the next volume (luckily I found it). Fans of the film will start seeing more and more differences in this and the next volume. I eagerly await the fourth."
1,Where can I find the other volumes of the Barnes & Noble edition?,"I am looking for volumes 2-6 of the HC edition from Barnes and Noble, would anyone know where you can buy them? I never buy paperback."
4,To learn important materials about networks in easiest way.,This book uses lots of graphics which makes it easy and fun to tackle such an important subject. Learning about the history of the industry is also another positive aspects of the book. At the end of the book you find yourself familiar with lots of materials which is quite useful to get into advanced phase of learning about networks.
5,This book is great for a beginner!,"I was not able to put down this book!Purchased it and read it from cover to cover. This was the kind of information I was looking for a long time and it was presented in the right way I needed. Text and lots of pictures/diagrams well balanced for a beginner.Finally I am able to orient myself in the filed of computer networking and now I know what direction to go, if I want to obtain deeper knowledge in it."
2,Elementary school returns,"I bought this book because it was required (a textbook for a class I was taking). Because it was a college-level class, I was expecting a college-level textbook. That's not what it is at all. The book is filled with color illustrations that aren't even very helpful. I was hoping for more reading and explanation of terms. Illustrations are great if they are used right -- to compliment the text instead of replace it. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is serious about learning the ins and outs of networking."
2,Would Not Recommend,"What I thought was Good about this book:- Nothing was inaccurate.What I thought was Bad about this book:- I didn't learn anything. For the most part, this book just gave a bunch of vocabulary ""buzz"" words, and ""hand waving"" of how the pieces fit together to make a network.I read this book because I wanted to get a better understanding of How Networks Work. After reading this book, I know the names of major components involved in various networks; however, I still don't know how these components actually process the information. The book shows a traffic cop controlling the flow of information. Fine, the book gave me the name of the traffic cop(s), but I was hoping for a more down to earth explanation. Might as well just say that it magically happens!"
2,Not so good for the name of how it works,"I recommand sybex 'networking complete'. Almost parts of this book is consist of pictures,and little text. So many readers complain of this point. me too. If you want much information from one book, buy sybex."
4,Almost the best,"Darden began playing little venues in and around Austin, TX. with a sized down band or solo acoustic guitar. The newer CD's are over-produced mainstream sound with Darden back there somewhere trying to be heard. This CD is like Darden live in one of those little bars where he still comes to share his good humor and stories of life with those of us fortunate enough to hear them. If you buy only one Darden CD make it this one - and catch him live if you ever have a chance."
3,Better graphics does not make a better game,"When you think of the arcade, what's one game that can possibly come to mind? Frogger, right? Remember its addicting traffic-dodging gameplay? Its memorable tunes? It's retro graphics? How about its charm in general? Well, this Super Nintendo version has only half of what I asked to remember.It has the same addicting traffic-dodging gameplay that put Konami/Sega (Though Konami won in a legal battle) on the map and, while it doesn't have the same graphics as the original, it provides its own colorful graphics. You would think that it would probably be better than the original, but no.What sucks about this version is that it doesn't have the catchy music from the original. In fact, it doesn't have ANY music. Just wonky sound effects. Also, since the game has been revamped with updated graphics, the wonky sound effects, and no music, it just loses the charm that struck me as I played the arcade game."
2,Not a 'must read again' book.,"The book was definitely not terrible but it also didn't set the world on fire. I was disappointed when Joelle went through such an ordeal to finally locate her parents resting place and it wasn't a big deal. They looked at it and then were off. I didn't think that Luke was that great of a guy (very mean to the Dr who helped in raising him) and couldn't understand why anyone would fall in love with him. I thought his character was one of a weird man. Joelle I didn't find extremely likable either. I liked the small, secret town that Luke was born in and I would have liked to see more of that in the book. All in all; I would say that the story is okay but it didn't leaving me wishing for more."
2,More holes than swiss cheese.,"I love paranormal romance. I severely disliked this book and will not be reading anything else by this author. The hero got off way to easy a the end, which was hugely unsatisfying. But the best part was that apparently the heroine and her parents were werewolves and never knew it. How can you be a werewolf and go through life without ever knowing it? Just because the author says turning at the full moon is a myth doesn't make it any more believable that people can go through their whole lives without knowing the are werewolves. And oh yeah, some werewolves descendents even if raised as wolf, never change. Because the magic is inconsistent. But the heroine, she can change. No problem. What's inconsistent is the whole book's magical premise."
3,Prince of Wolves,I ENJOYED THIS BOOK.IT WAS NOT AS INTERESTING AS SOME THAT I HAVE READ BUT IT HAD A NEWER TWIST ON WEREWOLVES THAT I ENJOYED. I WILL READ MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR.D MARTEENY
5,"Steamy, sexy book, well written and fantastic.","This is a sensual, steamy story that had me riveted to the pages. The hero, so well characterized by Ms. Krinard, is lonely, driven to find a mate, yet closes himself off from what he feels because of what he is. He sees the heroine and knows she is to be his next conquest, but she is determined to get the help she wants from him, without giving in to him. A sexy, poignant love story. Oh, to be hunted down by this hero...wow"
4,An intriguing world of werewolves and romance!,"Like an earlier reader who posted here, I also bought this book after I read and enjoyed THE FOREST LORD. This book PRINCE OF WOLVES is another engrossing read with a fully realized world and characters you can care about. I guess I like those gruff alpha men (like Luke) because I didn't think he was too much at all. I loved him! And Joelle was also a heroine to root for. I'm glad to know this is part of a series and I definitely plan to read the whole grouping. Wonderful romance, and a wonderful world to explore beyond our own! Don't miss it!"
3,Not so good as Krinard's others,"Susan Krinard is a pleasure to read. She writes well, her dialogue and descriptions are good, and in general the relationships are interesting. This one however is less good than some of her other books. It is too long, for one thing. It ought to have been shortened by a good 100 pages. And I agree with other readers, the characters are less attractive than others she's created. If you have to choose a werewolf-themed story, go with Prince of Shadows, or try some of her other works, such as Body and Soul. Still, Krinard is one of the best writers of fantasy or supernatural romance, and it's well worth checking anything new she does."
1,Huge disappointment,"I'd read The Forest Lord and really liked it, so I ordered this book. Good thing I didn't read this first or I'd never had read another Krinard book. This book was such drivel I can't believe it earned 4 1/2 stars out of 22 reviews. The romantic lead, ""Luke"", is such a totally unlikeable, one-dimensional, nasty character nobody could love him even a bit. And there was no chemistry in the love scenes, they were downright dry. The interesting mystery about Joey's missing parents could have been the saving grace, but it was a total dead end.There is really nothing I can recommend about this book. I would recommend Christine Feehan's Dark series or Sherilyn Kenyon's work if you like fantastical romance, lovespell etc."
2,Disappointing werewolf tale,"It's a good thing for Krinard that I read ""Prince of Shadows"" first. Had I picked this one up first, I doubt I would have finished reading it, nor would I have purchased any of her others. I found it very slow, though it did pick up quite a bit in the last 30 or so pages. I had to wade through more than 400 to get to that point, though. The premise was somewhat interesting --great-looking girl looks for place of parents' plane crash in British Columbia with the help of a real he-man who has forgotten to mention that he's also a wolf. Well, at least part of the time. And, oh, by the way the heroin is a . . . Well, I'll leave the finding of that one up to the reader should you decide to tackle this book."
2,A good story but.....,"Well I had to rate this on two levels. I liked most of the story, the plot was interesting which inticed me to buy the book in the first place but it seemed to ramble on and then would jump around that it was a bit confusing to read. I thought that the heroine was well done but the hero Luke was unrealized. The book took me days to get through because it tended to drag. I was hoping for more excitement and didn't get much.I have read others from this author and found them to be more thrilling and they held my interest throughout the whole book I wish this one had also."
4,"Impressively Wrought, a Little Schizophrenic","While Yoda is incredibly skilled, I do understand the complaints about the (over?) use of samples and incrediblly dense nature of the production. However, this is Yoda, and his idea that this is cut & paste, per the title should couch the highly constructed, collage quality of this mix. I think the scratching is both nostolgic and somehow new. While jumpy, if you like Shadow mixtapes and livesets of other DJs, then you will probably like this one too. takes me back to my childhood"
1,big letdown,bought this on a whim also due to the interesting playlist but dj yoda does not have the force working with him on this one. way too much 'wicky wicky' and stupid samples cause a headache and ruin the flow. this was supposed to be a highlight of our upcoming 80's house party but its back to the store for me.....
3,"Choppy flow, a little too much swearing, but very nostalgic","Bought this one on a whim ... it's not too bad, but ... DJ Yoda tries to interject a lot of samples, and they sometimes interrupt the flow of the music. Too many cuss words in his samples, too (but then again, I listen along with a 3 year-old-girl, so ... )However, it does take you back to the 80s with the different movie samples ... the most used being stuff from ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off."" You might not think it's the greatest at first listen, but the cd does grow on you.I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because, at the start of the ""Rise to the Occassion"" song, a movie sample says ""Go**amn!"" and I SWEAR it's Chris Tucker's ""Smokey"" character from ""Friday"", which is, what, from 1995? Sorry to be a purist, but it said cut and paste from the 80s, not 1995."
3,pricey,"average value/$---frame appears plastic vs. ""graphite"". Backing is some type of foam--like insulation sheet foam. This is-- NOT-- some kind of upscale board. It's OK but perhaps better simply buy cork & mount 20$ plywood , if you want functional/ durable."
2,Don't Take the Chance!,"I purchased this card so my mother could use it on a trip to Alaska. It worked for exactly 2 weeks; up until the day she arrived home. According to the data recovery company I sent it to, it short circuited. The images could never be recovered. Although SimpleTech replaced it, it was not worth the frustration and loss of once-in-a-lifetime pictures. I am now using the replacement card but it seems to write slower than my other cards and, frankly, I just don't trust it. I keep waiting for it to short circuit again."
1,"Will Die, Don't Buy","It's very simple, everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this CF card, 4 USB sticks, 3 SD cards, and 1 Hard Drive. Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache."
3,Love Elephants,Book had an old musty smell to it that bothered my sinuses. Enjoyed the story and phtographs added to my interest.
4,"""Nice Novellas""","This book is the reason why Alers, Hill, Jackson, and Ray are some of my favorite authors. Unfortunately I can't find ""Welcome To Leo's"" so I can fully understand how the characters came to be, but this is a good book none the less."
5,It's About Time!!!,"Anyone who has read books by these four women know you can't go wrong. This is the follow-up to the book ""Welcome To Leos"". In ""Welcome To Leos"" the owners of Leos saw love bloom right before their eyes, now it's time for theme to find love, and they do!!!"
5,A Good Read,Very enjoyable reading. 144 pages. Read it in 3 hours. Couldn't put it down. Found myself picking it up on the weekend and reading it again. Enjoyed it more the second time through. Enjoyed the true potrait the author was trying to paint. Not your usual dramatic novel. More phylosophical. Similar to the style of Virginia Wolfe. Very well written. I enjoyed the authors style of writing: uses a lot of sense attention getting vocabulary. A well done portrait of how things appear from someones mind. The voice inside this mind says it all. Kind of intriquing in a way. I really liked it!
4,A reward system for using the potty...,"This is a cute book. There are several flaps on each page, so if your child likes this type of book, it will keep them entertained. Not for hours, but they won't want to get off your lap halfway through. The pictures underneath the flaps are good. However, we have a little boy that is learning to use the potty. There is a reference that the bunny character in the book is a girl. It hasn't been a problem at our house, but it might be for someone else. The stickers are a bonus. Put them away from the book so each sticker is a reward. Otherwise you will use all the stickers at once!"
4,Good for my kid!,"My daughter loves this book and she has really bought into the reward system with the stickers. She loves the flaps and wants all of the same rewards that the Bunny receives (clapping. lollipops and stickers). Little bunny and her baby sister are helping her to realize that she is not a baby anymore. The visuals of the diaper changing, trash can, toilet and sink have also peaked her interest. She has been bringing us the book and asking to use the potty. She's not trained yet, but she went from balking to trying."
2,An OK book if your starting real early.,The stickers are the best hing about this book.( go out and buy a pack of stickers and make a progress board) Save your money if child knows what a potty is.
3,A little useful information...,"My problem with this book is that the author seems to confuse true astral projection with daydreaming and other things. There will be no doubt in your mind when you project as to whether it is real or not, because it will feel just as real as being awake on the physical plane - there's no mistaking it.But the book does have useful information in it, and some good techniques. It also contains a lot of information on overcoming fears, which is a very important step in projection. I recommend that if you're going to get this book, you should have some background in what is and what isn't projection, so you don't get confused when reading it."
2,Not much for techniques,"This book is ok. Most of it is filled with what you can do with OBEs. Its more of an introduction and experiences of others. Not much techniques. Every person is unique and what works for one doesn't work for all. The experiences in the book are quite common for those who are able to have an easy OBE. If you want to have an OBE I would recommend Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce. Not only would you know the neccessary information and experiences, but the technique works. After reading it for about a month, I was able to Astral Project. You only need one book... a good one, since most information are redundant."
4,"As Title Says....""For Beginners""...","I became interested in AP/OBE's awhile ago but just could not find any certain technique on the internet or on my own that worked with much success. I ran across this at a local bookstore, it was the only related book they had, so I decided to buy it. It brings up great points, but for me as a semi-experienced AP'er it was all reiteration of what is common sense in the OBE world. An excellent book for beginners, but if you are looking for advanced techniques or specific explanations, look elsewhere."
5,Astral Projection for Beginners is a Great Step-by-step ...,"Edan McCoy's Astral Projection- book is a great book for those out there wanting to learn Astral Projection and don't have alot of ideas on HOW. And for others who do, and want to learn other methods and things you may not know about Prjecting yet. She gives many GREAT examples in her book, and takes you through all the steps easily and in ENGLISH terms..... Its help me out alot.."
2,too much vague and impractical,"this book is theorical and apart from the good recommendations like inciense,candles etc. this book is lack of good exercises.in conclusion I dont think that you after reading this book,can make any astral projection.I dont reccommend this book !!!try better ""out of body experiences"" from robert petersonthis book has plenty of good exercises and the author writes in a very simple language."
4,"Practical, empowering, valuable, and unique...","This book offers techniques which enable one to penetrate, first-hand, ""non-ordinary"" realms of creation. Practical, empowering, valuable, and unique."

4,Book Review,"I was looking for additional information on a specific subject. I was disappointed that this book provided only brief info regarding it. However, other information in this book was helpful. Thank you."
3,It's ok,"I have been reading MANY books and studying Astral Projection for 3 years now. This is the first book I read. There are different approaches to astral projection, and Edain's approach is through the occult. I am not saying it is wrong. All I am saying is that if you are interested in using candles, incense, etc, then go for it. Her techniques are not very informative at all. She does seem to astral project easily with perhaps the assumption that it would be easy for you. I find it extremely difficult and need concrete and detailed techniques.She seems to be very knowledgeable and experienced in astral projection and I would be interested in reading more about her experiences. Perhaps she is going to write a new book!Hope this helps."
3,A well-written book,This book is well-written and offers an abundance of methods for getting through to the astral plane. I have always used one method and had no idea there were others out there. There is a good section for belaying any fears one might have before you even get to the different methods. I'd definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in astral travel.
2,astral projection,"Not what I had in mind, which I guess is my own fault. I was looking more for a book on relaxation."
3,Good to read,well i read the book and it's a great book to read even though i try but there nothing happen at all
3,"Nice idea, hard to refill","A flag-highlighter is a good idea, but it's hard to replace the flags because the cover is so tightly attached to the pen. There's no trick to it, no special cover position or anything like that. It's just a matter of applying brute force. Grab the barrel of the pen in one hand and the cover in the other and wrench it back and forth until the cover comes off."
3,Attention Students!,"I was given one of these highlighters for work. I must admit, it can come in handy!On a regular day of work - I do not use it other than for highlighting here & there. However, when attending a meeting, this pen was wonderful! Not only could I highlight the main points of interest, but I could flag the pages I knew I wanted to refer back to - or show a co-worker - etc.My recommendation would be for college students. I can see where this would be a very useful tool for the full time student. As far as office use (unless you do a lot of flagging of materials) - I can't say it helped me in my daily routine any.1smileycat :-)"
2,New pen ink spotty writing-hard to find refills,"I had wanted one of these expensive little pen gadgets for a while-I bought 2 of them; ink hardly worked right out of the pkg. I love the idea-couldn't find the refills. I would go back to the regular flags and pens in a cute case. I found out how to replace the flags-not hard for me. But, where to buy the flags? and, expensive for ink that sometimes works-sometimes not. Frustrating."
4,Post-it Flag Highlighter with 50 Red Flags per Pen PLUS,Great for any office filing and message system.Highlite your remarks for easy memory control.....
5,Get ready to Jam...,"When you hit the play button on your system, be ready to jam because the ""Intro"" will get you moving. The next song ""Lady"" will get you going if your not already getting the neighbors up! ""Grove Jet"" and the following tracks will get you going if your not already moving across the room...The second CD is pretty awesome too!!!! Great selections and for the price of a double set -- it is worth it! A must for those that can't get enough of the club scene -- this is perfect. Get ready to start moving..."
2,Not what I expected,"With so many positives reviews I thought this cologne would be great. Its just okay. It smells like so many other cheaper colognes (remember aqua velva?) If you want to smell like your dad or grandfather then this may be fine for you. I should have sampled it in a store first. I'm going back to Hugo Boss no.6, now there is a great smelling cologne that's second to none. Hugo will have the girls wanting to hug you just to get a whiff of this marvelous scent. This Bvlgari however will have you running away from yourself."
2,This is some different version of perfume..,"I dont know when I saw this one in mall it was awesome..but this one the fragrance wears off soon. I dont like this, I am going back to hugo boss original."
4,Bvlgari aqua...pretty good!,"I love the blast of pepper in the opening, but the drydown is the same old same old. It is definitely a great spring/ summer fragrance. Do NOT wear this in the winter unless you live in the bahamas for the winter or in a climate hot enough to merit the name, THE SUN!"
1,Overpriced and Poorly Designed!,"At one of the highest prices for cologne, you would think Bulgari would get it right, but not so with this product. The smell is heavy on musk and unpleasant unlike the original Bulgari for men. Plus the bottle will not even stand upright. Bulgari may think that is fancy, but it is just plain dumb!"
4,Perfume de hombre fantastico,"Perfume de hombre fantastico, que perdura aun cuando el usuario sea fumador. Recomendado por un conocido, es sin dudas uno de los mejores perfumes que compre hasta ahora."
1,Thought I'd Never Get This Washed Off -- Stinks,This is the most beautiful product in the men's fragrance aisle. The bottle's elegant shape and the color of the cologne seduced me into spraying it on myself. Oh my word! It smells like boiled cabbage with an overtone of cat urine. I thought I was going to have to cut my arm off if I couldn't find soap and water. And it wasn't just me. My daughter and her friends agreed.Buy it for the bottle. But don't dare let a drop out.
4,Decent Product,"I like the fragrance, I don't love it, would get something different next time, carries a premium price so I expect satisfaction"
4,"very good perfume, many thanks for this product","I am very grateful for this product because it had already time looking, thank you very much, keep it up"
3,Good but no my skin.,"The cents very good, but apparently it was not for my type of skin, it did not last like others."
5,Best scent so far,"I was using CK one before and after I switch to this, nearly every women I know complement about this new fragrance and get close to me to take a sniff :)"
2,Does not smell like original,"I am not sure if they have changed their scent, or if this is fake, but when i received the bottle, the whole plastic part came apart from the glass, then it didn't smell anything like my older bottle which had a few sprays left, but clearly different and not very desirable. emailed the seller with no response. hope this helps."
5,Better than mediocre,"This cologne is so much better than mediocre. My fiance loves this cologne, she got it for me on my birthday and have no plans of ever switching as long as they keep making it. It has a very nice smell to it and I have gotten a lot of compliments on how good I smell and the ladies at work wanted to know what I was wearing so they could get it for their husbands / boyfriends.Anyone who would think this cologne is mediocre seriously doesn't know what they are talking about. you can't go wrong with this cologne. If you're looking for something that will attract a woman at work / school or ladies looking for something that will increase the desire for your man, this is the one to go for. Like I said, my fiance loves it and she even sprays the sheets with it when I have to go to work :)"
3,"Best to try before you buy, imo","Product is just ok. You can tell it's of quality ingredients, I suppose? Understand, I'm not a big cologne guy and have never purchased a scent on line based on just reviews, and I won't again!My ofactory is well developed and acute. I know what smells good/manly and what doesn't.It's a bit too feminine for me...It's not bad, but, not what I expected based on posted reviews.If your unfamiliar w/ a scent, take the time and hit the dept store before you buy, you'll be glad you did."
1,quite disappointed :(,"was expecting something a lot better after reading the reviews. i believe i may have had an old bottle because it smelled cheap. sadly, cannot return it as stated in amazon's return policy for flammable materials. pay more and buy it in person."
3,Good cologne but nothing amazing,"This cologne smells like a lot of ""blue"" colognes which i've smelled over the years. It's a nice fragrance but i've now worn it off and on for 2 months and I don't remember anyone ever commenting on it. It sort of reminds me of an old Nautica cologne I used to wear when I was in my late teens. It is a decent cologne and you certainly won't get anyone telling you you smell badly- but if you spend $50 on a cologne you want it to POP a bit more than this one does. That is my impression- maybe someone else will buy it and love it. A few days ago, I bought Curve Crush on here for $26 for 6.8 oounces and i think I like that cologne more- it makes more of a statement and is a little more powerful and unique smelling."
5,Great for your man!,I love this clean smell of cologne on a man. It compars to Aqua Digio(sp) by Armani. Its a great gift!!
