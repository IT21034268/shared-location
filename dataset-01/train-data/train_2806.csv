1,Elementary My Dear Watson,"Tacoma's writing style is too simple for me. I like a book that challenges and engages me a bit more than this. I was not compelled to read on and had to make myself finish. Humorous, but not worth my time."
1,Pure Garbage,"Horrible! When I was was 3/4 of the way through and the author was still intorducing characters into the nonexistant plot, I felt the urge to slit my wrists. Then I realized that life is worth living because I only have to suffer through 1/4 more of this mess."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING,"I had high hopes going into this book, because I've seen where people have compared Robert Tacoma to one of my favorite authors [.......]. Wow was I disappointed. The characters in this book: boring, the plot in this book, even more boring. The book didn't even make me laugh once."
3,A bit predictable!,"This book is ok but is quite predictable. The author shares his exploits of a very brief military career which to be fair, is hardly anything to write about. I almost binned it towards the end but soldiered on. I would consider it to be over priced and not good value for money."
5,Great Movie,"This is the best hokey movie ever produced.Lundgrin and Benben make a ""dynamic duo"" that rivals Batman and Robin.Throw in the token woman, and it is a great watch many times movie.One of my favorites!!Mathius is at his best also!!"
2,"This has already had a studio DVD release. ""I Come In Peace""","I have the original DVD release of this from the studio. It is OOP. The correct name is ""I Come In Peace"". I also saw this during it's original theatrical run. Decent Lundgren movie."
3,Plot?... Acting?...,Who cares! You get to see a alien (calico) blaster tear up the place and Dulph cheesing it up to 11!Best Two Dollars I ever spent at the bijou! Dang shame it never made it to the DvD era~
2,Manic Panic Wildfire,"I have used 2 Manic Panic colors now. Wildfire and Ultraviolet. I tried the Ultraviolet first and it worked great, needed to touch-up once a week, but I wash my hair every day. I tried Wildfire and so far it's pretty terrible after 2 days. It didn't take very well to my bleached hair and had faded to orange the first day. It stains everything but my hair. Getting my hair the slightest bit wet will cause the dye to come out. I highly don't recommend the Wildfire Red dye. However the Ultraviolet was pretty awesome."
2,Disappointing purchase,"While the frame is very attractive, the display on Amazon.com online made it appear to be a 5 x 7 frame. There were no dimensions furnished, which I consider deceptive advertising by omission. I was very disappointed, when it arrived, to see that it wa only made large enough to hold a wallet photo."
1,marshalltown tools,"I am very disappointed and I do not think I will be ordering with amazon again. I called the company in regards to exchanging one of the products that was not a marshalltown product. They never sent me the info. I needed to mail it back. If I order marshalltown, I WANT marshalltown,,,not some other product with a noname brand."
3,"Good Assemblage of Facts, Lousy Photo Placement","On the whole, I liked this informative book. Mr. Vanderbilt does an admirable job of giving us an insider's perspective on the athletic footwear industry and how it has insinuated itself into popular culture. I also enjoyed the stories and comments in the sidebars which bolster his perspective.That said, the major thing that mars this book was the decision to place the photos of the sneakers along the spine. In terms of design, it was a poor decision, and it detracts from the text instead of enhancing it. I found myself flattening the book out as much as I could so I could see the photos, but even with that, the whole illustrative purpose of the photos was lost. If this book is ever updated, I suggest that the photos be placed somewhere that the reader can see them in their entirety."
4,Glad I didn&#65533;t have to wear her shoes,"Imagine being married to the local San Francisco rabbi. Then imagine having the 15yo daughter from hell, complete with runaway episodes, truant behavior, the works. Sherril Jaffe had to deal with all of it, and she tells us the trials of her parenting efforts as she tries to understand, discipline, and help her older daughter thru the trials of adolescence while, at the same time, trying to hold the family together. And all of it is done under the eyes of her husband's congregation. Jaffe gets points for her honesty and humor.Oy vey."
2,"Movie, Maybe; Book, Not","Where did the author ever get the idea that his movie could be successfully translated into a book of still shots? This book fails on every level except one:Its one success is that it is a completely innocent book --truely candid. But only one photo in it, a picture of an Afro-American girl smiling at the cameraman, is worthy of the book's high aspirations. Some other shots, which would have succeeded otherwise, are just too diminished by the blurriness that characterizes the entire book. Compositionally, most of the photos are no better than throw-away snapshots. They certainly aren't doing their subjects justice. Kash, as a beachcomber, is a fraud. He hasn't spent enough time at the beach, or else he got his brains baked as a kid and is too fried to take the time it takes in the sun to amass a portifolio of good still shots."
4,Like nothing else you've ever heard.,"This CD includes some of Jan Akkerman's finest (but not flashy) guitar playing. Kaz Lux's vocals are strangely soulful - and definitely not for everyone. I bought this when it first came out on vinyl; loved the music and hated the vocals. The vocals grew on me - I learned to love them too. Bits of the music sound slightly dated now (that's why it doesn't get five stars), but this is still a terrific work. Any fan of Focus or Jan Akkerman should have it. -- The Fly"
2,Very disappointing.,"Jan Akkerman was one of the finest guitarists to come out of Europe's prog-rock movement of the seventies. You'd never know it from this disc. Akkerman underplays to a fault here. It is not unlike the style he assumed for his last ventures with Focus. Unfortunately, he is the lone bright spot even if he has played better elsewhere. The vocalist Kaz Lux is just awful. He over-reaches on every note and his voice is not particularly good to begin with. The rest of the band is competent but production leaves them sounding dated. The rhythm section in particular is weighted down by the occasional disco-influenced beats that detract from the overall performance further. Give this one a skip. Get any of the Focus recordings up to and including Mother Focus or Akkerman's early solo work...Simon"
1,Ouch!!,"I'm a huge Akkerman fan and a fan of his 70's instrumental band, Focus. He's an awesome guitarist, but this mess is certainly a CD that should be ignored. I don't understand how any Akkerman fan could recommend this. Jan is a guitar instrumentalist, but Akkerman's guitar licks are overwhelmed by the horrible vocals of Kaz Lux. I'd love to hear some of the instrumental portions of the music. I don't recommend this to fans and I especially don't recommend it to anyone looking to buy their very first Akkerman CD. A first Akkerman CD should be Heartware, Can't Stand the Noise, Focus in Time, or Passion. Don't waste your cash on this disaster."
5,"Wow, I love these Powerline products!",I have been using wireless products for the past year but was having problems with my network everytime my wife would get a phone call on our 2.4 GHz cordless. To make matters worse the microwave seems to interfere with it as well.I had heard of these powerline products that communicate over the house wires so I bought two Netgear XE102 ethernet bridges. I must say I am pleased because I just plugged them in and they worked. Now I just bring one of the XE102 with me thougtout the house and I can get Internet access without the interference of wireless. Next I am going to buy a powerline router.
2,Not as good as HPNA,"I've had a phoneline network running for a couple of years with no problems, but Linux support for HPNA NICs is difficult so I needed a second bridge to link Cat-5 hubs. Two of these powerline bridges were cheaper than another HPNA 2.0 so I tried converting over. ... Our big house must have even worse power wiring than our screwy phonelines, because the bridges couldn't maintain a connection more than a few rooms apart. They worked about as well as HPNA 1.0 did, which isn't good enough."
2,worked for 1 day . . . haven't got it to work again,"I bought this from BB and it worked great right out of the box, Not sure what happened after the first day but now i can no longer get it to connect. I'm not getting an internet signal at the remote location. For the $80+ i spent on this i would have been better off just upgrading to a new Pre-N wireless router. Don't waste your money . . . if you do still want this I'll gladly sell you mine!"
2,It didn't work for me,"I tried using it to connect two medium sized rooms that were right next to each other. It only worked reasonably well for a little while after I plugged both of them in (or unplugged them both and re-plugged them in). It might have worked for non-internet networking, but I just wanted to have net access and that wasn't happening except for a brief period after resetting the power as I mentioned. It seems to have gotten a lot of good reviews, so maybe it was just my place that was the problem, but for what it's worth, it wasn't the magic it sounded like it was."
4,"It was ""plug in & go,"" no joke","These babies worked right out of the box with xp. Plugged one into a laptop, and the other into a switch, and it immediately worked. Is it fast? Well, I'm used to 100baseT & 1000baseT, so no, I don't think it's fast per se, but it's a lot easier than stringing wires from room to room in a house where all the walls are closed up (or hoping wireless maintains connection over a long period of time).I did experience one caveat: If my laptop entered suspend mode, sometimes the connection would seize upon restart...not always, just sometimes. Who knows what the laptop's ethernet port is doing during suspend restart, but it isn't something these network devices always like. Minor issue imho - just leave the laptop up."
1,Not a good customer experience,"For whatever reason this set-up did not work. As others have noted, phone support is non-existent. Even at 4 am they won't take your call. Email to support was also fruitless. I got one email back asking ""what are your settings?"". I replied, sent a tracer but never heard back. I see they have discontinued this product. Technical issues aside, Netgear has a ways to go to provide basic customer support."
1,TOTALLY BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When it decides to bless you with actually working it's fine. Mine goes out at 6 PM every night, on weekend afternoons, and right now (10:30 am on a friday) I've had to keep a dial up service too! How hard does that blow?"
1,"When it works it's great, when it fails it's impossible","These things look like a great deal. You plug them in and off they go. The problem is when something goes wrong - there is no way to troubleshoot or resolve issues. Unplugging and plugging back in is your only option. Netgear support does not exist.My area is prone to power spikes and very brief failures (less than a second) due to area construction, these events kill the network. Sometimes unplugging and plugging back in works, sometimes it does not and then you have no recourse but to leave them unplugged and hope someday they will decide to work again.For me, these things are better than nothing but only marginally so ..."
4,A good textbook on the study of attitudes.,"A clear, consice study on the methodology and current research in the field of attitudes. Detailed information providing a strong background knowledge of the topic while still accessable to those who do not have a great deal of prior knowledge in the field."
4,Great Dance Anthem,"This song has a terrific beat to it and it's a great dance song. Although there are a few words in this song, the singer does a great job with vocals and the lyrics are just great. It hit number 1 on the official U.K. charts a couple weeks ago. I gave this single 4 stars because I thought it could have been a little more faster and been more creative with the song overall. I really suggest you buy this and you won't regret it~"
5,Great Book,If you want to read what a U.S. Navy Seal does for his or her's lifetime this is the book to read.
2,Not that exciting,I was glad that it wasn't simply a shoot'em up but I was disappointed that there weren't more missions described there was too much on security testing of bases and events that were overall not that exciting. Though some information was informative I finished the book wanting more for my [$]. Disappointing overall.
1,Terrible writing and vast lack of real content,"This is probably the worst book I have ever read about Navy SEALS, SWAT, Special forces, or even the military in general. Mr. Chalker is clearly and overwhelmingly in love with himself. Unusually though, for a narcissist, he leaves out lots of details that would make this book somewhat interesting. He describes lots of little incidents and conversations surrounding his interactions with civilian life, but there are no real stories and details about his military actions. If he is going to fall back on ""Secrecy"" as a defense on that count, then one has to wonder why eve bother writing the book in the first place? If you aren't planning on giving any account of your training or your operations, then there is nothing to tell. I think a teacher in the South Bronx would be able to write a more compelling story of danger and heroism about her day teaching than this terrible book. I kept waiting for something to happen.Don't waste your time with this book."
1,Whats wrong with AMAZON? Get your act together!!!!,"Why can't these items be purchased for Kindle in Australia. Dont the ""wires"" stretch far enough??? We can get everrything else over the net so why not a book???"
3,good stories by one of rogue warrior's 'real team',"Well, I thought this book was a good read, and a good account of Chalkers career. I'll have to say the book was less detailed and obviously doesn't have the unique view of things that Marcinko did, but that doesn't lessen Chalkers' accomplishments. It was really cool to get another perspective on formation of Seal Team 6 and Red Cell, and also to compare accounts of Urgent Fury between One Perfect Op and Inside Delta Force.As far as Inside Delta Force, the books do give the impression that ST6 was built more from the ground up and operating in a more balls to the wall manner than Delta Force, of course that doesn't change the fact that both units are the best in the world at what they do, and it goes without saying that there's alot that the books don't mention about the units' operations."
1,great guy - below average book,"Book lacked detail. Author had some interesting experiences which he talked around but provided no depth. If you want a Seal book to read, try Marcinko's Rogue Warrior or Boehme's First Seal."
3,theatre design student's review,My costume history/design professor recommended this book to me. It has good text and pictures. I'm drawing historical costume line drawings for my professor and this book really helped me with the research. But the only thing about this edition is that the pictures are grainy and unclear. The first edition (I borrowed my professor's book) is a lot clearer.
3,Not what I expected,"The item pictured does not match the description. The picture is of the ""Green & Yellow Delivery"" puzzle, and is what I thought I was ordering. However, it failed to register with me that the item description for the ""Legacy of John Deere"" refers to a completely different puzzle than what is pictured, and is what I received. Shipping was very prompt. The item will be a gift so I haven't opened it. The recipient is a big JD fan, so I'm sure it will still be well-received. I just wish the listing had been more clear about what was being offered. Hopefully Amazon will fix this issue so others don't get fooled like I did."
1,bad wokmanship,The puzzle I received was junk. It was all cut up wrong. The end pieces are broken some pieces were missing the ends. This was destroyed during manufacturing making it impoosible to assemble. I have bought many Freitag John Deere puzzles and this is the first that was junk.
3,Pleasant diversion for a while,"Interestingly engaging photos. The less stagey conceptual ones towards the end of the book work better for me. But what is with the production values. Many of the shots look digitally oversharpened, with compression artifacts everywhere, as if they were shot with a department store digicam."
1,A lightweight general introduction to a complicated topic.,"This book is an introductory overview for the non-professional. Far from living up to its cover copy, the book seems to be aimed at individuals or amateurs who, for example, want to present their collections of antique baseball cards online. It includes whole sections, for example, covering Microsoft Access and FileMaker Pro while coverage of Oracle, DB2, or SQL server is handled by a couple of paragraphs. I seriously doubt if any IS professional will find this book ""to be an invaluable step-by-step guide"" as claimed on the cover."
2,I recommend a better book,"I read through this book and learned a few things, but it is not an in-depth step-by-step guide. It seems to be aimed at amateurs or IS people who are clueless about database-driven Web sites, which is possible since IT is a wide field.If you truly want a step-by step guide and you're going to use Microsoft products/technologies, you definitely have to check out 'Web Database Development Step by Step.' This is your step-by-step guide! It is a cookbook with excellent insight. There truly aren't many guide books covering Web DB development, and that MS Press book is a gem."
1,I wish I could give this zero stars!,I can't believe how incredibly drying this shampoo is. It strips every bit of moisture from your hair. I bought it to use on my daughter because she has such dry hair. This made her hair even more dry and straw-like. I used it on my own hair to see what it was like and it's awful. It is more drying then a clarifying shampoo. I definitely won't be buying this again.
4,"One great song, One great artist.","Although most of the songs on this album are a bad representation of Omar's talent, the title track was enough for me to buy the entire album. It's notable that Omar wrote very few tracks on this CD. As a result it doesn't reflect his musical genuis as much as more recent albums."
5,If I can learn to sculpt - anyone can!,"Hands On Sculpting is a wonderful way to learn step by step the fundamentals of sculpting. Whether the reader is a beginner, as I am, or experienced, this book will guide you when you need it and inspire you to keep sculpting one project after another. Dottie's instructions are clear and precise, yet not intimidating and allow for your own creativity. I highly recommend this for any artists book collection."
4,Inner workings of a hotel; lousy love story,"This is one of the most dated of Bennett's novels, even though it is his last one. The love story is soooo 1930s, so arch, and so awkward. But the descriptions of the minutiae of the operation of a large luxury hotel, actually the major part of the book, is fascinating."
2,A little pricey,"Sharpie markers are great no matter where you buy them! The price was a little high, but I was paying for the convenience of shopping from home."
3,How Is this Weekly?,"The Weekly Curriculum book by Barbara Backer has many interesting ideas but I cannot see how it is weekly! I go to look up the month of November and find ""Third Week in November"" as the first theme in November. That is the entire chapter for November. I don't know about the rest of you, but my school attends November for four entire weeks, not just the third one! There are 52 themes in there but they are not in any order at all.My other books go like this ""First week in Sept"", ""Second week in Sept"", etc.I'm returning it."
5,Original Ideas,"Finally, a curriculum book with a different approach! As I peruse this outstanding, yet simple collection of teaching ideas, I find myself getting excited for summer vacation to be over, so we can try these great ideas! (Well...for a few minutes, anyway!) These activities cover all the learning and development areas in ways that will keep the children's attention and don't require any complicated preparations. I really can't wait to put these ideas into action! Well done, Barbara!"
2,Two Stars for Two year old curriculum,"I was disappointed in this resource. Going from being a third grade teacher to a two year old teacher I wanted a lot of ideas that I could use in my classroom. For advertising it as a weekly curriculum, I felt it was more just a monthly suggestion, like Mother's Day for the month of May or Mitten Day for December, without enough activities to cover the month. I purchased ""The Complete Curriculum for Two Year Olds"" and I liked it MUCH better. It has suggestions for themes, books to read, songs, and fingerplays. That's what I was hoping for with this book."
5,Alan Watts was a pantheist. So what?,"I must like and agree with Alan Watts since I have read over 40 of his books. I also have nothing against pantheism. If Watts was a pantheist then that is a good thing in my opinion. There are a lot of worse things than pantheism - theism, for instance.The author of this book does a good job of quoting Watts and laying out the thinking of Watts. So this is a good reference book on Alan Watts.But the tone of the book and the wrap-up chapter are rather critical of Watts. The fact that the author of this book does not care for Watts's philosophy of life and ontological viewpoint is a big ""So what?"" - lots of people didn't care for Alan Watts. No one can please everybody.Again, one can just overlook the author's judgment and enjoy this book as a good reference book on Alan Watts."
4,Why I give it only 4 Stars,"I have been an Arena aficionado from the song I heard. John Mitchell is fantastic.This is the third (actually 4th)live performance I have. The best, both performacne, and sound quality is from the DVD Smoke & Mirrors (there is also a 2nd live performance , but it is incomplete, and the quality is only tolerable.) I would rate the performance on Live & Life to be quite good as well. The band performance on Breakfast in Berlitz is also quite good, but suffers a bit from recording/production. Also, I think starting the concert with the longer, epic piece like Moviedrome is a poor choice, especially for the Arena neophyte.Still, I think for all who enjoy Arena, it is worth adding to your collection."
4,A Mathematically Sophisticated But Frustrating Treatment,"The book is a translation of a French Text. Generally, the exposition is mathematically sophisticated and flows well. However, many of the interesting and important results are given as exercises and long problems with many parts which can be frustrating (& irritating). In fact, I would estimate that a third of the book consists of these exercises and problems. The book should be used as a companion to other more basic books on option pricing like ""Financial Calculus"" by Baxter et al."
4,A stochastic approach of finance for engineers!,"The french initial version of this book has been one of my first technical papers that deal with stochastic calculus towards finance. It is written by and for engineers I must admit, but students in actuarial sciences (like me) won't be lost by so many formulas and equations if they agree to read with a piece of paper and a pencil on the hand. I have worked on the Vasicek's model and the simulations described have helped me a lot. Too bad that the lattice model is not explored. Anyway it is a good preparation before the opening of ""Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus"" from Karatzas & Shreve."
3,Too Much Exercises!!,"A compact & rigorous book on the mathematics of financial derivatives.However, it's not a best buy for having too much exercises . I would recommend Neftci's or Baxter's book for newcomers"
5,I loved this book (and I normally don't read short stories),"I loved this book too, as I see others have, and this prompted me to write a review. I have tried to give it as a gift whenever possible and will continue to do so, as I think it is a great idea to benefit CAC. I wish local bookstores would display it more prominently. I grew up in California but this book allowed me a personal look at histories from different corners of the state. Fascinating, well written and truly enjoyable."
5,California writers,An amazing book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to know about the REAL California. Just amazing stories about real people and their real lives. California truly is amazing.
4,Liked This But Not Enough To Buy,"This is another recording I learned about via the Ken Burns' ""Jazz"" DVD series. I took it out from my library and played it for many days. It was enjoyable and I really can't criticize it. The numbers that are old standards are lovely and Young certainly was a superb player. However, I have several Coleman Hawkins' recordings already. He also plays the tenor saxophone, also plays many old standards and I simply like his playing better. For me, it is even more emotional and heartfelt than Young's. I didn't just ""have to have"" this album like I did the 2 Miles Davis albums that the ""Jazz"" series led me to try either. I took those out from the library too and then immediately bought them after I returned them to the library. There are many albums I like but I don't feel compelled to buy them. I feel I can only give them 5 stars when I run out and buy them after listening to them!"
4,Metalic Paper,"Good computer-making card material. Apparently it is now no longer sold?! Pity! I like it for golden color cards; however it is a tad on the flimsy side. In other words, the material could be a little more substantial in weight."
2,Dull story telling and drab artwork combine for a snoozer.,"Tremendously mediocre work. Spend the money on dinner instead, it's more memorable."
5,Wonderfully curious!,What a delightful book! I enjoyed seeing the various envelopes and miss that folks to write letters all the more! Hope to see more from Harriet Rusell.
2,Used review,"When purchasing a used book I realize you are taking a chance, but I never expected a book with such colorful kid markings where a small child apparently used it to play school. Sometimes a sample of the inside would be helpful in making a better choice."
3,The Absolute Beginner's Guide to Showing Your Dog,This book was informative and very helpful for my first match last week. It was easy to read and understand for a person who is new to dog showing.
4,Great book for a beginner in showing,"Great book with lots of information on all you need to know on getting into showing your dog. I bought this book because I was a beginner and had know idea at all on showing it really helped me. The only thing I did't like about it is the pictures did't really have many pictures and on stacking and gaiting did't have any pictures to show you how, but great information would really recommend this book for beginners."
1,"Beware: This is not an ""Invacare Tilt-Top Overbed Table""","This is not an ""Invacare Tilt-Top Overbed Table"" its a different table from another brand (Drive) and its not like the image at all (different color and build), so beware if you want the Invacare table."
4,Great cookbook,"My mom had a copy of this cookbook when I was a kid, and some of my favorite recipes for biscuits and bread are contained therein. It was also a great tool while we were planning 4-H Food & Nutrition projects because there are nutritional analyses for all of the recipes. All-around great cookbook!"
4,Very intriguing mystery,"I was introduced to this series of mysteries earlier this year and have been reading the books in order. I have enjoyed reading them and found this, in terms of the mystery, to be one of the best so far. Crombie writes well thought out, intricate stories, and this when left me guessing until the end. My 4 star rating is due to the fact that Kincaid really seems to be more of a side character here. Gemma is really the main character, which is fine, but I would have liked to have seen more interaction between the two. I highly recommend this series as well as Peter Robinson's ""Inspector Banks"" series."
2,Disappointing again,"This book, like the others in the series, is supposed to be a mystery. But virtually half of the book is about Duncan, Gemma and their ""family"", and has nothing to do with the mystery at all.The other half, the mystery, is unfortunately disjointed, confusing and hard to follow. As a result, it's sometimes even tedious.After the promise of the first few volumes in this series, this one -- and the previous one -- come as a disappointment."
4,Terrific New Addition,"For those of us who have already gone through P.D. James and Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell, Crombie is a terrific new addition. Having read a couple of her books, I am really happy to know there's lots more left to be read! Most of her novels come with rich/deep characters that you get to know and care about, as well as good plots. While at times I sense a concerted effort on the author's part to closely mimic typical British detective novels (esp. a la James and Elizabeth George), and some books have this weird 'formula' (interruption of chapters with a few paragraphs in script, usually thoughts of the killer, copies of letters, lengthy quotes, etc.), Crombie is still a wonderful read that does not frustrate or insult the reader. Highly recommended."
2,Needs to be cleaned and tuned!,"This square is now made in the USA, and, like our automobiles, is just not world class. Sorry, I'd love to say the ""Made in the USA"" still meant that it is among the very best, but certainly not in this case. It is a tenth of the cost of the Starrett, which is still world class. My ""square"" came considerably out of square and the blade had been dipped in some sort of protective coating which had dripped down along the edge of the blade so it was uneven. After taking the coating off by 600 grit paper on plate glass I was able to square up the tool with some diamond needle files used in the slot of the body. The product comes with a ""Satisfaction Guaranteed"" label saying that the company will replace it....with what? Another with the same problems? Also the scribe is not sharp, not very hard steel and requires many turns to remove it from the tool, which is not very convenient."
1,Not Square,"The ruler is not square. It is covered by some strange type of hard coating that is very difficult to remove. Once removed, it's still poorly made and not suitable for carpentry work. They sell this thing at Home Depot for a reason. Buy something else."
3,They are pretty good,"I just received these, and they are pretty good. Remember, these are organic, with no sugar added, so they are not going to taste like chocolate. For what they are, they are pretty good."
5,What a treat!,"I am always on the search for great music. I heard Cory Combs' first cd, and found it to be amazing. Imagine my delight when I found ""Valencia"". The trio that he put together is magnificent. The music, mostly written by Combs is very complex, and showcases the impressive talents of all. The trio plays with such sensitivity and grace whether the music is hard-driving or more mellow. Don't miss this. You will be entertained and left wanting more."
5,WHERE ARE YOU FINDING IT?????,"I have been looking for the cd everywhere. even on their website the merch section is ""under construction"" and you cant get it. Amazon, Best buy, FYE, none of them have it. Someone please help me out."
5,From a phantom to a race walker,"I found the book, Racewalking, to be a wonderful introduction to the pulse quickening world of racewalking.To be honest, besides wanting to get into shape through racewalking, I bought the book because of William Finley, the co-author. Why? Go rent Brian DePalma's 1975 movie, The Phantom of the Paradise, which Mr. Finley starred in. He was fantastic in that movie as the Phantom, and equally as wonderful as an author that introduced me to the sport of racewalking."
2,"don't order the 3rd edition, go 2nd",I bought the book b/c I had read parts of the 2nd edition of Nunnally's book and loved how well he organized his points and related psychometric theory together. I think the new author may have screwed the book up by inputting (his/her) own jargon. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANYONE INTERESTED IN THIS BOOK TO GET THE 1st or 2nd EDITION - don't make my mistake. Nunnally passed away in 1982 and this is copyrighted 1994 ... stick to the work he did when he was alive.
2,"The material may be good, but it's tough to get through","I'm in a Ph.D. program, and this is the required reading for our psychometric testing course. I was looking on the Border's web site to find a different book to read that would cover the same material, that would not be so difficult to understand. Nunally has a nasty habit of poorly defining terms, which makes it extremely difficult to grasp what he is talking about. It's challenging enough to understand psychometric theory, let alone with a practically illegible textbook! This book needs rewriting! I've given it two stars because supposedly the book contains a lot of valuable material. Of course, this doesn't matter one whit when you can't even read the darn thing!So professors, please, don't do this to your students!!!"
3,Just too difficult,I can tell the book is very comprehensive.But the book lacks examples and the wording makes it more difficult for the readers to follow.
3,Purchase the 2nd Edition,As have several other people who have reviewed this book I would suggest purchasing the 2nd edition. I have both of them sitting side by side on a shelf and use the 2nd edition much more than I use the 3rd one. It is not written in as clear a manner as the 2nd edition and sought to expand beyond psychometric theory which might have watered it down some. I was surprised that the reviewer who wrote that the 3rd edition is longer than the 2nd is correct as the 2nd is thicker - but it does have fewer pages.
1,Cica-Care Gel Sheet,"I've always been pleased with products ordered on Amazon ;hh owever, the Silicone Gel sheet that was to be used on my back didn't adhete to the skin. Theproduct was privy and I was very disappointed in the product."
2,Useful but doesn't stay on very well,"You will see a difference in scarring when using these sheets. However, if like me, you move around a lot at night, then you will find then not on your body, but somewhere else in your bed since they seem to easily come off with some friction. I have found this to be the case with most types of scar sheets, however, if you use like an ace bandage on top of it, then they do tend to stick on and do the job. Also liked that you can cut these to any size you like."
3,Still waiting to see results,"I've been using this product for over a month on a fairly new surgical scar. It's hard to tell if it's working, but every time my doctor sees I'm using it he praises me and says it's a good thing. You're supposed to be able to re-use a strip for up to two weeks, but I haven't found that to be the case. It totally depends on what you're wearing over it."
3,scar away >,"this product is not as good as scar away. I tried it and I noticed it does not stick very well. You need to put a band aid over it to make it stay on. The scar away is much stickier, lighter, more comfortable to wear, and it works better. This is a waste of money but atleast i tried it. oh well, live and learn."
3,Gel Dressing for a Key loid scar,The gel sheets are OK but don't stay on like it says it should. The silicone gel in the tube was more effective.
2,not seeing improvement yet,"i've been using it for about a month now, but dont see any improvements yet. I'm going to keep using it to see if it works for me.. crossing my fingers.."
3,It reopened my wound,"So far I have had a very unusual experience. I had it on for about 3 months an the scar without a doubt got better over time, and definitely lowered the bump as well. Then one day I noticed a small opening in the wound, and every time I took the pad off there was a small amount of puss. In fear of infection I called Cica Care and they said they never heard of this before and to remove it immediately and wait for it to close up, they said after that I can try it again but if for some reason it happens again to take it off. I will update this review at a later date."
2,Doesn't stick very well.,Bought the pad for my six year old son after he scraped his face falling in the street. He wears it during the night and at home but we have to cover it with a dressing or it falls of when he plays outside or turn in his bed. Maybe it works better on other area of the body and on folks that are less squirmy! For the efficacity I can't tell because we haven't used it for the whole 4 months yet. The scars are less red but the bumpy ones where the cut were deep don't seem to have changed at all. I keep using the Maderma cream with SPF during the day and hope that in time my son's face will look better.
1,"High price, Get Nothing","I was really mad after I used this product. You literally get one sheet for $50 or so. It claims to be able to stay on until you take it off. Nope. I had to use strips of medical tape to keep it on and even then, it would flop off."
4,Cica-care,This is the best product. I used ScarAway and Mediform with very little visible change in my scar. But 24-48 hours after using Cica-Care there was a definite improvement.
3,Cica care,I starting using it would not be able to tell the results until I find a way to secure it on my chest..I was very happy when I received it... But mow I'm not becausing it keeps falling of unlike the mepiform it stayed on for days without moving...have to secure theCica Care in order for it to stay on the area.
4,Good product,"I purchased this product to help decrease the appearance of my keloid scar. I have noticed the keloid is flatter and a slight decrease in color. Its only been 3 weeks, so Im excited to see the results after 3-4 months. I gave it 4 stars because I havent seen as much change in color as Id hoped for. But again, it has only been 3 weeks. I hope my review helps."
4,Mariam,"Very quick delivery, product in a reliablle packaging. I've been using this product on burn scarves and they seem to become more flat and less visible.Cica Care Silicone Gel Sheeting 5 x 6 Inch, Sterile"
1,Poorly organized and incomplete,"I was disappointed at the lack of information in the book. I was interested in basic interpretation of rules such as ""reaching around"", and ""over the back"" and other fouls. They were nowhere to be found. What information there is is difficult to find. The index is quite minimal."
4,I have the PD FuXion Rainbow (PD-099-01) 128MB version,"I got it about a year ago. It works well but you can't fit many songs on it. You can record from the radio and reception is quite good. Mine also has a voice recorder. I want an iPod now, though. When you try to go from song to song too fast, it may freeze up, but just remove the battery and you won't loose anything. When the battery is nearly drained, it may do wierd things, like buzz. But I was still impressed with the battery life. If you could get, like, 3GB on this, it would be nice. Cute and portable, mine is sliver."
2,Poorly done,Just barely better than the Blum book. At least the runes that come with it are worth having. That is the best I can say for a book that all but ignores the information that most authors are aware of. A 25th rune never existed before Blum in the Elder Futhark. Yet many modern books seem to insist on adding one including this one making this one like the others almost useless.
2,NOT a best of DVD,"I was excited when I saw this dvd. Based on the description I thought it was a best of DVD which would have been great. Strikeforce has now had enough events to constitute a best of.The dvd says ""featuring some of the biggest, most brutal fights in history."" It never tells you that it's just three entire events on dvd.Very disapointing."
4,Hard to find but great product,"I looked everywhere local to find this kit (I was given the kit # from a Selkirk Rep). Once I received it the instructions were limited, but the kit was so easy it was no problem. It has been up and running for about a month now.Con: There is only one hanger to attach to the wall, and it is a fixed distance from the wall. You will need to purchase one more hanger to really be secure and possibly block up the one that comes with it to make it work. Would have been nice to have more piping or longer sections."
5,Great Price and Product,I paid about 150.00 for the whole kit which would cost much more if you bought the pieces separately. Selkirk makes a great product but once the pieces are locked together they are hard to take apart. Selkirk suggests using high temp silicone to join the pieces. I chose to use foil tape by 3m which does a great job and is a lot less messy. Overall a great product at an awesome price.
4,Anthony Rules,Do you like the writing of Piers Anthony? You'll like this. It ranks up there with the NOTEBOOKS OF LAZARUS LONG.
3,"Good but not thorough, yet pricey","This is a good introductory book and only that. However its usefulness to a graduate student or a practitioner is limited because of two factors.1)Many mathematical derivations like error probabilities are stated directly without proof, even in simple cases.2)Practcal and commercial use of the theory is not covered in detail.Given the above two factors the cost of the book is not at all justified."
3,About average as far as textbooks go,"Sklar covers a lot of material fairly well. At times his explanations are not clear. At his weakest moments he leaned heavily on mathematics without supplying much discussion and left me more or less bewildered. I noticed this problem with many texts during the spent 6 years I spent in graduate school studying physics. ""Digital Comm"" is a fair book but not a gem."
3,over rated,"Although the book was technically the ""digital Communications:fundamentals..."" book it was the international version which changed some of the questions in it. Also the cover was falling off so its rating of condition seemed higher than it actually was."
4,Good to have,Very good for self-learning reference book. To learn some digital signal processing first would help to understand what in this book better.
3,Graduate Student Review,"My motivation for purchasing this text was for a graduate level course on Communications in Electrical Engineering. The text was somewhat useful with clear illustrations and formulas but lacked the clarity desired to grasp a full understanding of the material from simply reading the book. As such, the text was primarily used as a reference source when lecture material failed to provided enough depth or coverage of a particular subject area. I would recommend purchasing this book if required but I would look for another text if you are simply trying to get a better understanding of the subject."
1,Low quality,We Bought these for friends in India.Was embarrassed as the Emblem fell off with in 2-3 days of use.
2,Its okay...,"Love the sound of Dixie! But it only lasted about 3 months, then it melted? We didn't use it that often, but it didn't last long."
4,wolo dixie horn,"This horn sounds great. A little fast at first but after about 30-40 times of use it sound normal. Oil the compressor once a month. Installation took about two hours. Package comes with 5 horns, 1 compressor,plastic hose,1 horn relay.Try to install the horns as close as possible to the compressor."
1,not good,"This does not work well. It sounds really bad and is an overall waste of money. I would not say it plays Dixieland song, more like it plays.. noise."
4,Worth The Wait,I actually bought this horn for my sister for Christmas. She has been talkin about getting it for 10 years now and i finalized it for her. She was in shock and couldn't wait to use this wonderful product that was so difficult to find elsewhere.
5,Wolo Dixie Horn,"I bought this horn about a month ago and the first one was defective. But Amazon sent me a new with no charge. This second one is great. Works great in my S-10. Didnt bolt them to anything just rednecked it, then I buddled them up, put a zip tie on and stuck it under my hood. Makes things alot easer :) I would recommend this horn. Its been alot of fun for me. Just make sure you buy some wiring. The kit doesnt come with any. U'll need about 20 feet just to be safe. You will only need some wiring if you dont run it throught your old horn. Hope you put this horn on your truck!"
4,good horn.... but you gotta work for it to perform,"after the tough wiring and instalation(which might have been easier if i just hooked it up to the normal horn but i put in its own switch) i can do the wiring in about 5 minutes now. but all that aside if you play this horn when its really nice and warm out its great. a few rules to note.if the temp outside goes below 65 degrees F. take the motor inside. it doesnt work well after being out in the cold.other than that rule, if you forget to take it off when it gets below 65. dont hit the switch... it will further mess up the horn. and you have a small chance if it got really cold out that it will work again. it does not like the cold. the cold kills it. they could have also made the horns metal so they dont break so easily."
4,"works nicely, but know what you're doing","This horn came in the mail today and works great, but you'll need to know what you're doing, or know somebody who knows what they're doing when you install it. I had to get a 20-amp fuse and some wire, find out where the stock horn is located in my Jeep, and use that wiring to hook the Dixie horn up to the steering wheel horn button. I didn't have a clue as to what I was doing, but had help from some friends. You'll need to know which wires to use and not cut into any vital systems. For a 2010 Jeep Patriot, the best place to mount the trumpets seemed to be the top of the motor cover, and the compressor seems to fit best near the grille, but I had to remove the battery cover. Also, I would recommend that anybody living north of Alabama(or maybe Tennessee) uninstall this horn for the winter to avoid having to replace it, as it seems to be meant more for summer use. You might want some extra rubber hose as well, it doesn't come with very much."
1,NOTHING TO HONK ABOUT...,"I got this for my husband for Father's Day, and he installed it in his off-road vehicle. Let just say he got to use it three times all in the garage. The horn no longer works!"
4,"Beautifully, long enough","This is one of those books that becomes like a good friend and, fortunately, is long enough that you don't have to lose her for a while.Set in pre-Communist Russia, this is the tale of a strong peasant girl, Marya, her arrogant but fragile mistress, and their gruff, frightening, but surprising jailer-turned-protector, Boris. The scope is large, the writing beautifully descriptive, the dialogue meaningful. It is a story of loss, betrayal, suspense, and love. It is a story of what happens when you lose everything you thought you wanted and find that you can start a new life with one you thought you didn't want."
2,Cheap epoxy coat,"First, I should admit I bought it at a brick and mortar store and at the time wasn't aware that it was made of laminated carbon steel. (I picked it because it felt solid, was reasonably priced, and was made in the USA.)That being said, I've used this square twice and already the laminate is peeling at the end and rust is showing up in all along the edges. If I want to keep it now I'll have to remove the laminate, buff out the rust, give it a coat of oil, and maintain it like I would any other carbon steel tool. Maintaining tools isn't really an issue, but the company that makes this clearly cut corners when they decided to cover it in cheap epoxy and claim it protects the tool from rust, when in reality, it's just there to make it look pretty on the shelf. Needless to say, I don't recommend this tool."
2,Useless for developers,"Book doesn't contain any technical information but introductory basics - no code, no details, nothing."
1,If you can count from 1 to 10.... this book is not for you,I have an engineering background and I strongly suggest others with a similar one or even more better some basic high school math knowledge not to buy this book. I could complete this book and all of its 'exercises' in an hour. All it does is repeats very basic math knowledge which I bet you will not forget even after 50 years from now. All in all bad book for GMAT Geometry preparation. Now I have look for ways to sell this book which I bought two days ago... any buyers? not a scratch on the paper and is all in mint condition.
3,Thin on Content,"After reading the editorial reviews I eagerly anticipated receiving this book. When I did I was somewhat disappointed. I found it thin on content. The diagrams are clear, but the writing is not. It's not very well-organized. There wasn't much that was new to me, and calling it a ""Complete Book of Baseball Signs and Plays"" is a stretch - it's far from complete.If you want a better book, get Ron Polk's Baseball Playbook - an animated playbook CD is also available from some suppliers online."
5,"Great fit, no breaking in shipping, good product.",I thought these might be broken in the shipping but they all arrived fine. Good buy!
1,It was the wrong product - seller would not exchange,"It was the wrong product for my computer and after contacting the seller, I was told he was from ""out of state"" and would not be able to exchange it, he suggested that I sell it back on Amazon - otherwise that he would be back in a couple of months and would see if i still had it. This is a waste of time and from now on I will be more careful to make sure that I am buying from someone more responsible. - Buyers beware!!"
3,netgear,"Theres no slot on my laptop for this item to slide into be sure you check your laptop to make sure theres a slot for this ,I wish I had known this before I ordered this so I'll end up giving this to someone. The shipping was great and great price right."
3,"The Netgear worked fine, but","The Netgear worked fine, but was not necessary. A family member needed help and needed a better faster PC. He said something was wrong with his laptop and he wanted to sell it. I said I'll help him out and take if off his hands. It was not over a year old and I new it was worth grabbing it and no one would buy it from him. After re-installing it's original software, nothing was wrong with it, including the ""PCIMA"" slot. The card worked fine and if I need it again, I hope it will not be needed for any other laptops. It helps to have one when needed for a test someday in the future."
1,LapTop failed,"My Laptop was very old. When the product came and I installed, the computer refused to start. It sounded like the harddrivegave out. I've given up on the product. I'm sure the product was fine. I had used one before and it worked ok."
1,"JUNK, DID NOT WORK, WAS RECONDITIONED NO WARNING","I bought this WI-FI card to use on my notebook computer and when I had troubles with the card. I called the company and when I was unable to submit a serial number (there was a blank space where the serial number was supposed to be) they told me then it was reconditioned.There was no disclaimer of this and to say the least I was PO'd. No wonder the card gave me dismal performance. It would require me to reboot every time I used the computer. This was a giant hassle and to say the least I jerked the card out of the notebook and inserted the old Linksys WI-FI card and set it up and never looked back.I ended up selling this reconditioned card for next to nothing loosing my investment. The card was not very expensive, but it was the idea of the fact, it was reconditioned without telling me it was so."
3,Sony Vaio+WinXP may not like it,"I recommended this to someone on the basis of the relatively stellar reports here. So, I figure it's fair to leave the caveat. I spent 2.5 hours trying to get the WG511 working with Vaio with a bit of time spent with tech support with a light Indian accent. She had me use the old 1.1 software on the original CD. Newer ones were posted on their website but if you check the dates on the software & drivers, they're actually a bit older than you're led to believe. The upshot was it still didn't work and the older is only a bit better than the newer. In between, I got plenty of messages about ""WG511WLU.EXE"" wanting to disappear and hide.The WG511 worked on my Toshiba and the Sony worked with a MS MN-510 usb adapter.This is still bleeding edge stuff as far as I'm concerned."
4,"Works fine, but remember to update the driver","I have a MR814v2 802.11b router and purchased this WG511 802.11g wireless card March, 04. The signal is weak and unstable compared with my previous Dlink 520+ wireless card. I have to update the driver of the wireless card and the firmware of the router to newest version, then it works fine. But I don't think it has greater range or stronger signal than the Dlink."
5,super duper,"Just bought this for a friend after a nightmarish three days trying to get a similar DLink adapter and router working. Popped it in and it worked like a charm immediately. And it's nice to look at too. Netgear, I love you."
2,Weak Signal,Don't know if it's the card or the wireless router but have a weak room-to-room signal. Changing channels on wireless router and doing a router upgrade as offered by Netgear tech support did not help. Tech suppport did offer additional phone support which I have not pursued.
1,Not Compatible with Jornada Handheld PC as advertised,Unable to get the software to speak to the computer despite numerous attempts alone. Even support service on their website has been unable to help me resolve this problem. How do we go about returning this item? It is completely useless to us. Thank you
1,"Windows XP lockups, etc.","First the software messed up the login, I only have 1 user and the guest account is turned off so I boot straight to the desktop. After installation I got prompted for a password every time I started up. Then it kept locking up to where the task manager would not even come up, you have to power down. when restarting after this you get a screen that says the pc is locked and ypu must enter a password. after entering the blank password the desktop appears for about 15 to 30 seconds then the pc reboots. Go through this 3 or 4 times and it works normally for a while before starting the whole thing again.After removing the software and card the pc is working fine.I would not buy this card or any of Netgear's products again. Not after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon."
4,Working great,Was plug & play for me into a Dell Inspiron laptop running Win98SE. Followed the installation instructions and was up and running in minutes. Router is a Netgear WGR614.Only giving four stars simply because I haven't tested out its various features or performance in detail. Been great so far.
2,Pay for tech support,I just found out that after 90 days Netgear wouldn't provides tech support unless you pay for the service. I then called Linksys to see if their policy is the same as Netgear. Linksys said they will support all product as long as you own them. Please beware and call before you buy any Netgear products. It is bad business in technology if you don't support after 90 days.
5,Excellent Product,"I bought a Linksys G Router and the accompanying Linksys G PC card for my laptop. Of course the Linksys card would barely connect with the router, and when it did, wouldn't maintain a connection. I returned the Linksys card and bought the NetGear equivalent, and sure enough, within minutes I was up and wireless. Thank you NetGear for making a great product."
3,"Excellent hardware, bad software","Using the included install CD, it did not work on W2000 with their own MR814 802.11b router. It would connect only occasionally, then drop the connection in a minute. The latest driver from their website fixed the problem.On Linux, the prism54 driver supports this card, assuming you bring your own firmware. The firmware extracted from the cd did not work, while the firmware could not be (trivially) found in their latest drivetr. Luckily I found a standard prism54 fw somewhere on the net which did.Once I got through the exceptionally painful installation, it works smoothly and has a greater range than my previous Netgear MA401 and Dlink DWL650 802.11b cards."
1,Unstable-Internet Connection Drops,"I started to pass up the chance to rate this until I saw how high the overall rating is. The user group on the NETGEAR www site documents how unstable this card is and the dopped internet connection issue. I agree with all those who mention ease of installing etc.- then BAMM! After about 2 months, internet connectivity becomes an issue. I had not been to the NETGEARS users group before. Before buying this item go to their web site and search for ""internet drop"". Lots of customers are dissatisfied with this card-BEWARE! I have tried lots of fixes-uninstalling/reinstalling/using the NETGEAR Mgr/using the WIN XP mgr-nothing seems to work. Untold hours spent. This is my last gasp-now searching for a Linksys replacement as recommended by others."
5,This card is awsome,"I love it, strong signals, i'm not surprised this is one of the best cards out there, but now there's the WAG511 but for 60 bucks more. ..."
1,Terrible support and compatibility issues with Windows XP,Be aware of Netgear products. They only give support for 90 days and then they charge a hefty sum. This product has compatibility issues with Windows XP. The company had to release new versions of the driver but they did not keep up with the windows automatic update downloads and therefore the product was constantly failing. Their support is miserable and outsourced to India which had to help on multiple occasions but after the warranty there was a hefty charge. I just went out and bought a Belkin wireless card and it seems to work great......Be very cautious in buying Netgear products.
2,Very hard to install,I just purchased the WG511 wireless card and have had great difficulty installing the card. I have a Compaq notebook computer running Windows XP and using a Netgear MR314 router. The card cannot make a connection with the router. I downloaded the latest drivers to no avail. This card is difficult to use with XP. I previously had a MA401 card and that card stopped working after 6 months. I am very disgusted with netgear products and support service. Service is essential and Netgear is lacking.
2,I hope you don't need tech support,"While many people who have purchased this product were able to plug it right in and go, I actually had some problems in the setup of my Netgear Acccess point and this PC card. The technical support by Netgear is horrible. If you have any problems you are going to spend a long time on hold and then speak with technical support people who only know how to fix the basic items that can go wrong. At this point I was referred to second level support and told I would receive a call back in 24 hours. Over a week has passed and I haven't received the phone call. I've since purchased a Linksys wireless router and PC card and was able to connect right away."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS CARD,"The WG511 is excellent when working. However, whenever one disables the connection it is impossible to reconnect without rebooting the computer. I run this with XP Home and a notebook that I know works perfectly. Netgear support is as usual helpless, from technicians that can barely speak English to long holds to being told to install the new firmware (which didnt help). If you dont want a headache and countless frustration then buy a different card. Netgear deserves the bad publicity which is why I am posting this."
1,Garbage,This card was horrible After everything was installed we found out that this card can't keep up with any of the security of the past couple years. Therefore this card doesn't recognize your network rendering it useless
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have owned a few netgear products over the years with little to no problems. Boy, let me tell you, this hunk of junk too the cake! First let me say, setup was easy. Thats it. From then on its been a nightmare. For starters, it would take FOREVER to find my router, even when it was 2 feet away. Ive got 2 xboxs, 2 wiis and a few other laptops that have no trouble finding my router. Strike 1. Now, at some point i was able to get the software to locate my router, and it would connect, but i couldnt surf the net. After spending over a month searching web sites and trying upgrades, even 4 different window programs, 98, xp sp1, 2 and 3. Nothing. Strike 2. The third strrike came when I could get everything connected, and even surf the net, for about 2 mins!!!!!!!! The connection would still be there, but browsers wouldnt work. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good bang-for-the-buck,"I'm happy with this purchase. My very old laptop (HP Pavilion ZE4145) does not have WiFi built in and for the past two years, I've been using an Airlink 101 USB Wireless dongle. This PCMCIA card picks up more signals and is more secure on my laptop than any USB dongle could be. The software is ok, but I had difficulty entering a WEP password for use with my router. No problem, I just let Windoze control the card and it works exactly as I need.In all, the card picks up weak signals, provides a solid physical connection to my laptop, and performs exactly as I had hoped."
5,Worked the first time in!,"I had purchased a DLINK DWL650+ card at first. However, after several evenings with this card and one hour with DLINK tech support I gave up. Funny thing is that the DLINK card is supposed to be talking to a DLINK DI-713P wireless router that I installed last year.I went to Fry's and asked two different beleagured sales associates which of the WiFi cardbus adapters brands they sold had the fewest returns. Independently, they both mentioned that Netgear had the fewest. So, although priced higher, I bit the bullet and got the WG511. No problems with installation and it worked the first time with a Compaq Amada M700 running Windows 2000 server version. I am definitely thinking more about using Netgear stuff."
4,WG511 great reception,"In early 2003 I purchased a Netgear MR314 wireless hub and a MA401 card for my laptop. This router and card are built to the slower 802 11b standard. Recently I purchased a second laptop and wanted an additional card for the second laptop. Rather than buy an additional slower card I purchased the new WG511 wireless networking card (faster 802 11G standard) to be used with the slower hub.The new card is 'backward compatible' to the slower wireless router and has noticeably stronger reception than the MA401 card. The newer WG511 card allows me to take advantage of faster 802 11G wireless networks when travelling,and to use the card on my existing network when at home. Setup was seamless, and the price with the rebate is about good - other 802 11G cards are selling for around $20 more. Netgear products have proven to be consistently reliable and a good value for the $."
4,Easy set up and great price,"Took me about 10 minutes I wouldve done it faster except for one problem I hadThe Netgear connected wireless but it wouldnt connect to the LAN.The error massage was ""LAN cannot connect'The fix was to goto Device Manager and disable the previous Netwrk card on my laptopAfter I did that connection went smoothly."
3,Good except for one thing....,"I like having this card for wireless internet. The only problem I am having is keeping the wireless card connected all the time. I read everyone else's reviews, and they are able to have their computer anywhere in the house at any position and it stays connected. I don't know how to fix the problem. It's a nice card but my connection won't stay."
3,Beware of misleading product marketing!,"I have no experience with this product specifically, but this line from their product description caught my attention:""And with up to 128-bit WEP encryption, you can rest assured that your wireless network communications are private.""Make no mistake - WEP is NOT a secure wireless protocol! Do research on the subject matter and you will find that your 128 bit WEP key can be sniffed and cracked using just two intruding laptops and freely available hacking tools in under 30 min.If you are really concerned about wireless security, look for a product that supports WPA-PSK."
3,Era lo que me esperaba ...,"Me compre este producto a pesar de toda la critica que tenia, si ...tuve problemas con la tarjeta, bastantes problemas, los drivers con los que viene son malisimos y no esperes que te funcione sin que los actualizes, peor si usas WinXP sin actualizar.Una vez que logre actualizar los drivers de la tarjeta y WinXP ha funcionado de maravilla y no ha presentado absolutamente ningun problema."
2,WPA does not work for a lot of people,"Installation was easy until I decided to upgrade. I bought the card so that I could have faster speed and higher security using the WPA software upgrade. The speed is great, but the upgrade did not work at all, and I have since discovered that a lot of people are having trouble with that - it seems to be a problem with AMD-based laptops. Tech support was a big waste of time, and I am now trying to decide whether WEP security is good enough or whether I should return the card."
5,GREAT Wireless card - watch out for the REBATE though!,"The Wireless Card has been excellent - works well with the Netgear WGR614 Wireless 802.11g 54Mbps Router.What I do complain about is the company that NETGEAR have selected to run the rebate program (TCA REBATES ~ www.tcarebates.com). I bought both a router and a Netgear WG511 Wireless 802.11g 54Mbps PC Card. They advertise a $20 rebate with this router and a $10 rebate with the card. I sent in the correct forms, receipt and both UPC Labels (all in one envelope).TCA sent me an email to say they were disallowing the $20 rebate because they did not receive the UPC Label for the router (though they apparently did find the Wireless card UPC). This is complete nonsense since I have photocopies of all the materials I submitted.Anyway, don't count on the rebate reducing the price - otherwise a fine buy!"
1,Has big compatibility problems,"Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. IT DOES NOT WORK WELL.I have SMC 7004xxx router/switch. Every 10-20 minutes Netgear should be pulled out and some times notebook must be rebooted. My notebook Fujitsu Lifebook with W2K worked just fine with Linksys/SMC/Cisco/IBM wireless cards. After 3 days of downloading and upgrading with different drivers WG511 goes back. Some times WG511 blocks all other network connections. Rumors are that Netgear chipset does not work well with some CardBus/PCMCA adapters. The configuration utility lacks simplest settings like fix transfer rate to 11 Mbs or 5.5Mbs. But registry still carries most of them. Multiple problems and driver with reduced set settings means that product is unstable. Since most reviews either very good or very bad it looks like WG511 has compatibility problems."
2,Romance and Reality in Tibet,"Rinchen Dolma Taring's book is a potentially remarkable narrative of the almost gut-wrenching speed with which most Tibetans were thrust into the harsh realities of the 20th century. It is a pity therefore that the naivete of the story-telling does not mature as the author does. She remains in the telling, a wide-eyed voyeur with superficial comprehension of the tumultous events that devastated the country and displays little empathy with the ordinary men and women who accompanied her into exile. This, whilst reflective of her class in the old city of Lhasa is irritating in the context of Tibet in the 21st century. Not a truly serious read, it is probably best appreciated by readers graduating from Enid Blyton to PG Wodehouse."
4,Contemplating Retirement?,"Dr. Sadler has helped my plan for my transition from my first and second ages (achieving, accomplishing what others wanted from me) to my third age where it is OK to do things that I want to do.The book provided me with suggestions for carrying out this transition and research and examples to convince me of the potential of this period of time in my life.I would recommend it to any one who is contemplating retirement and is unsure of his or her next steps."
4,Bobby has still got it!,"I own quite a few CD's from Bobby's early days on Bluenote, so when this one was finally released, I jumped at the first chance to buy it. Very good move on my part. All of the musicians on this album play marvelously together, and Bobby is no exception. This man can still play with as much energy and feeling as he ever could. Some very pretty ballads on this album compliment the faster-paced high energy tunes quite well. I would definately pick this one up."
3,Setting suns,"As respected a vibraphonist Hutcherson is, heavy lounge qualities cannot escape many wishy-washy solos residing along songs that do little more than provide dark, smokey atmosphere."
1,This book is fiction,"It's very simple, really. The open portion of window of the sniper's nest was only knee-high and a few inches off the ground. If someone was standing at the window, you could possibly see their shins, but nothing more than a shadow in the window's upper, closed portion.Brennan claims to have seen Oswald well enough while he was STANDING at the window to describe his height, weight, age, and clothing. Brennan is lying.Brennan could not identify Oswald at the police lineup. He later he claimed to have lied about not being able to identify Oswald on that occasion out of fear for his own life. Should you stumble across this book, don't waste your time."
4,The old standard,"I have owned several stair guages throughout my career. They are always sold in pairs, so I am not sure why they call it a ""2-pack"" as just one guage would really work on a framing square. But these are made well, and because they are brass, they should work well for several years without any worry. Just don't loose them. They have been the same for at least 20 years. The only thing I would like better, is if the thumb screw was more of a ""wing-nut"". I like to make sure they are on the square really tight, so I usually tighten them with a pliar or vise grip before a start to do a lot of marking."
5,effective!,"It is a pleasure to use this paint scraper. The long handle is great (unless you're in a tight place) and being able to use all 3 sides is a genius idea. If you have much of a project, I would recommend buying extra blades for it, or else figure out how to sharpen it. I use it with a heat gun to soften the paint first. The process of paint removal is not fast but it is thoroughly satisfying to get down to the bare wood with one pull of this scraper."
1,Steering rack was the wrong size,This Beck 103-2702 steering wheel rack was supposed to fit on a 1999 BMW 528i. That's what the ad said.This part looked like the proper part but it was 1/4 of an inch off so it didn't fit. This part needs to have its description changed.
5,As needed and as described,"Good price, quality product, arrived well packed and fast (clearly ymmv based on seller). Go much cheaper per disk and the options appear to be much less reliable. My advice is on the day you look, pick your quality level and buy based on per disk price. A little more effort required, but better than getting a bunch where half fail."
4,CD-R 50 pk,Like the way the cd's are enclosed in the holder. Have used this product before to copy pictures of my grandchildren off the computer for safe keeper.
5,Philips = outstanding media,"I have used the 48x and 52x versions of Philips CD-R, and I am happy to report that I have not had ONE single coaster from these discs!Philips (teamed with Sony) came up with the idea for the compact disc, and revolutionized the future of digital media.Why not buy from them? They're obviously the professionals, here!"
3,"Easily stop working if scratched, even if it's just a bit","not that special, they can start skipping easily, if scratched jsut a bit, they don'tlast as long.. I recommend other products I'll never buy Philips CD-Rs again."
5,Excellent,"I changed the firmware on this product, so I cannot comment too much about this product. Other than to say the hardware works great"
4,works well with xbox,"great value for a device that will work with almost anything. this seamlessly extended my network preventing me from having to run more CAT5 throught the house. right now it works as a network adapter for a modded xbox but I have used it with a switch to provide access to multiple machines. great alternative to the overpriced ""official"" game console adapters."
2,Not for the faint of heart !,Spent a good deal of time trying to get this thing to work properly. The manual is of little help. Has few specific instructions and limited troubleshooting options. I am a linksys user as well and find configuring their products childs play compared to this bear. No significant online help or set-up options as far as I can tell. Hope You have better luck than me.
1,WG 602 very limited,Purchased the wg 602 to expand my current Netgear wireless system only to find out that as a repeater it will only work with another wg 602. The box that the AP came in shows a typical network setup utilizing a wgr 614 wireless firewall router and the wg 602. Why would netgear clearly show this compatibility when its not the case? Support on this issue was a joke.
2,bridging use..,I bought this product to use it as a bridging client in an existing belkin wireless network and it failed to pass any data even though it showed connected to the belkin Access point. According to the Netgear docs this access point can operate as a access point or as a bridging client but what the fail to tell you is that it bridges only in a netgear environment. After spending 20 mins on the phone with Netgear they told me i needed to buy a different model which is non netgear-proprietary or more netgear access points....How can a company like this be selling proprietary hardware in todays day and age...Leon McCalla
5,Works great with two bridging to one another,"I've had two WG602v3's bridging between each other (through 3 walls and about 30 feet) for about 2 years. They are rock solid ALL the time, except when the power goes out. When the power goes out, it sometimes takes some finessing to get them to see each other properly again, but I just noticed there is new firmware released about 6 months back that appears (by the description) may fix this issue. Unlike some reports on here that state they need to power cycle it daily, I at least have never had an ounce of problems with my two v3 units (running firmware Version 1.2.2), other than than when the power goes out. I use WPA2-PSK AES for my security.I think these could be a little bit of a challenge for someone not fairly comfortable with networking, especially if they use them in bridge mode; but this could probably be said of any networking gear with a similar use.Great product in my eyes. Thanks Netgear!"
5,Very pleased!,"Mine came as a V3, but Amazon does not specify this, so I'm assuming they ship what they have. Also the V2 and V1 are a little old, so I don't think you will receive one of those.WPA Security worked like a champ for my laptops...although PocketPC (WM5 and 2k3) does not support it.Bought mine from Amazon in January 2006 (...)No complaints, the plastic housing seems cheap, the antenna looks a little flimsy and short, but none of these things affected performance....it simply works great out of the box!"
2,Hope You Don't Need Tech Support,"While many people who have purchased this product were able to plug it right in and go, I actually had some problems in the setup. The technical support by Netgear is horrible. If you have any problems you are going to spend a long time on hold and then speak with technical support people who only know how to fix the basic items that can go wrong. At this point I was referred to second level support and told I would receive a call back in 24 hours. Over a week has passed and I haven't received the phone call. I've since purchased a Linksys wireless router and PC card and was able to connect right away."
1,There are security issues with this product,"The U.S. government has posted a security alert regarding this product (see http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/o-159.shtml) and classifies its vulnerability as ""HIGH RISK"". As long as you get V2 you are OK but otherwise you are wide open to hacking."
1,review of Netgear WG602,"In an attempt to increase the range on my Netgear MR 314 router, I got this WG602 access point but I could not get it to function. I was told I needed two of them, so I got a second one and I still could not make it work. I gave up and replace my router with a RangeMax WPN 824 and it is terrific. Gives me all the range I could want, letting me send and receive at 24 Mbs where the MR 314 would not reach at all."
4,WG602v2 is a way to go. And it's fast!!!,"WG602v2 is a lot better than the WG602 802.11g.When you update the latest firmware, you'll get :- Access Point- Point to Point bridging- Multipoint bridging- Repeater- Support for WPA-PSKCompared to other access points with bridging, this AP is a lot cheaper. Detachable antenna also is a right way to increase your range. Just buy a 5.5dbi Omnidirectional antenna with RP-SMA connector, and you have a range of two times farther than before.Works great with WG511. It's fast. Transfering a 50Mb file onthe network is only 20 seconds...."
2,3 hours on tech support,"I spent 3 hours with tech support and could not get it working properly. After the first 2 calls they had me buy a crossover CAT5 cable, then the 3rd call could not even get it working properly. Each time you call, expect to spend 30 minutes on hold before speaking to someone. Even the initial connection was flacky, one day it would not work and then work the next. My experience appears to be the same a several other reviews here."
2,Got What I Deserved for Being Cheap,"My wishful thinking convinced me I could use this to hook up my ethernet-only Blu-Ray player to my wireless router so I could watch Netflix movies over the Internet, all for $36. As others have pointed out, it doesn't work as a wireless bridge. I ended up buying the ""Linksys by Cisco Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming and Video Adapter"" for $99 to get the job done."
4,Works as I hoped,"I read other people's reviews recommending its functionality but complaining about its documentation. It did take me a number of tries to get it to work and to find a location for it. But it works fine in the end. I did have to give up on WEP and turn to MAC-based access control. The instruction apparently is too simplistic and assumes you have a Netgear router. I use it to extend a Hawking 54g wireless router to cover 2 floors, with WG602 in repeater mode. The antenna give better signal than a 7db one I was using. If it were not for the lame documentation, I'd give it 5 stars."
3,Need to reboot daily,"I've had this for about 3-4 months now. Really love Netgear products but this is the first one I've found disappointing. It seems to hang up about once a day and needs to have a hard reset (can't reach it via the web). Since its up in the attic this is a real pain. When I sent a question to the service group about this they told me to load the latest firmware (my message to them said that I was already running the latest firmware--I don't think they even read it). This replaced a Netgear ""A"" access point which was MUCH more reliable. On a positive note the signal strength is very good for B (nobody in the house is using G)."
1,Just get a wireless router...,Unless you have a wired network already and just need to add some wireless coverage. If you are buying Netgear you probably are small enough that you could just buy a router with wireless built in...
5,Works Great super seller!!!!,This produst was Very easy to setup and works wonderfully. COuldn't ask for more.
3,WG602 WAP,My laptop built-in wireless picks up more networks then this AP. I purchased this so that I could pick up MORE not LESS. LAME.
2,On my third one now,"I am on my third one of these access points now. Both boxes simply stopped responding and wouldn't reset. Netgear technical support was no help either. My advice, try the Linksys box first."
2,Low range but dependable,"Setup was easy. I picked it because other Apple Newton users said that it was compatible.This AP worked great for me but the range was really low. I only got reliable data transfers when I was within 3-4 m from the AP.Solved the problem with a 7db dipole antenna. But you shouldn't have to do that in the first place.Otherwise it has provided over 6 years of use before starting to show problems and died just yesterday, over a 3 week period."
2,"Results, Recognition & Rewards","I can't rate the book, because they didn't have it. The rating is for the company that said they had it and didn't. They sent me an email apologizing they didn't have one to ship and immediately credited my account. I am happy with the immediate credit, but not about not getting the book."
2,"First-name Novelty Coffee Mug (""I [Heart] Name"")","I was delighted to get a coffee mug with my daughter's name (which has a slightly unusual spelling) emblazoned on it. Unfortunately, the words streaked after a couple of washings. Doesn't seem worth the hassle to send it back, but I hope the sellers get this note and look into their manufacturing. And/or send me a replacement cup!"
4,Dope Dayton Ave.....,"I'm riding wit these Dayton Family boys cause they have yet to put out a weak album. This is their 4th album now how many groups can say all their albums are good. This that gangsta music with a meaning.This album is a 1/2 star drop from there last album ""Welcome to the Dopehouse"". One reason being i think they put to many songs, it has 19 trks no interludes. They have always did between 14-16 trks. The good thing about the album is not to many duos blend so tight like Shoestring and Bootleg so the delivery is strong. The producation is typical Dayton Family str8 Gorilla gangsta out the trunk music. They rep the Mid-west very well. Enimem isn't the only heat out of Michigan. Hotep!!"
5,Oil is Oil..right?.not so fast........,"Oil is Oil..right?...not so fast........ If your looking for some of the best oil on the market then look no further. While it is true that Snow 2-C is formulated with low temperature fluidity and pump-ability, it is not just for oil injected systems but can also be used in pre-mix sleds. I use this oil in both my sleds, one a high performance pre-mix and one with an oil injected system. I run my oil pre-mixes at around 40:1 (I know everyone wants you to mix 50:1, trust me running too lean will not help protect your engine) the first thing you will notice with this oil is less smoke even though you run a heavier mix. c"
3,Royal Purple REC,"FOR PRE MIX SNOWMOBILE USERS ONLY!!!AS PER ROYAL PURPLE WEB SITE: ""2-Cycle TCW III is suitable for premix in snowmobiles; however, due to cold soak (low temperature pumpability issues with oil injected snowmobiles) Royal Purple recommends Snow 2-C for operation in temperatures below 20F."
4,Imagine if New Order had a spunky little brother.,"That would be this band. High energy, cohesive rock. And this is just their first ablum! I cant wait to see what they do in the future."
1,Not a good fit for iPod 160GB classic,"I bought this for my new 160GB iPod classic, and I am going to have to replace the shield.Because one piece covers the entire front (except for the wheel), it doesn't adhere right all the way around the screen, so it's bubbled around the edges of the screen.And that same piece doesn't fit the rest of the front either because it's too big and the edges didn't adhere to the iPod, so the shield picks up dust or anything else because the sticky part around the edges sticks out around the edge of the iPod."
2,plastic shield,the shield is a great idea but does not stick to iPod very well adhered easily to the screen but did not stick to the back quick solution for a cheap price but won't last i would suggest purchasing a skin instead
2,BE AWARE,BE AWARE.The product is not like the image shows.It's not cover the all front of the ipod.The area of the wheel has a weak glue.I'm not happy with the product.
1,Do NOT buy this product,"Do NOT buy this product thinking that it will work on your 30G iPod (as shown in the photo). It won't. I feel totally rooked by the seller - and it isn't worth the postage to send it back. If I could give zero stars, I would. Shame on you, eforcity."
3,its alright,its not a perfect fit but it works... it sticks and it helps with the scratches.. the only thing i didn't like was the center button sticker it was a bit too small and it came off
5,illuminata,i use it everyday and take it with me everywhere. it is very inspirational and the prays fit my needs
5,Must have,I received Illuminate about a month ago the way that Maryanne breaks down the book into sections are so helpful. This allows you to concentrate on specific prayers an I really enjoy that. It doesn't just offer prays but food for thoughts sections in which you can meditate on then apply to your daily living. Again a Must have the usuage is endless.
4,Good Movie,"Last Plane Out chronicles real life events of journalist, Jack Cox the war ravaged areas of South America in the 1980's. A compelling story as he & his team fight to get out of the country. Jan Michael Vincent & Julie Carmen were great as lovers caught in the middle of a war. I hope this gets out on DVD someday."
3,Only Dotson's review has any legitamacy,"Other than Dotson, these 3 other critics suck; there completely pointless! None talk of the movie itself which is what I wanted an opinion of since I haven't seen it! I first commented on the loser who blames Pres. Reagan, even though Reagan wasn't elected or sworn into office for another 1 1/2 years! Read my comment to see what a blatant liar that fool is, will ya? And comment? I just had to write something, I couldn't let disinformation go unchecked. Someone please view this flick and give an honest, quick, review, huh?"
3,slow down,"excellent title trackfrom the sandra bullock movie,although there are to many versions of the one song, but it does have the excellent acoustic version of the classic rebell yell which also features on the new greatest hits compilation well worth the money for this track alone.go on buy it"
5,The captivating story continues...,"Bonnie Leon has created characters that are believable, and she has woven a story that twists and turns as real life does. There are no easy outs and no pat answers for Yuri as he struggles to survive in Russia; or for his sister Tatyana, who faces numerous trials as she begins a new life in America.I've enjoyed each book in this trilogy. I appreciate that the author is always a step ahead of me, and I cannot predict the direction the plot will take next. It is easily the best fiction I have read in a long time."
5,For believers and non-believers,"Catherine Ponder was one of my favorite authors, even before I began reading scripture. Learn to expand your life and well being."
4,Love it - need it!,Being an Elementary teacher I am constantly battling numerous viruses. This product really assists me in keeping illnesses at bay. When I did not Have access to the Anti-V I definitely succumbed to many more battles with various illnesses.
4,Crime in the wealth ghetto,"Another Burke novel. This time Burke has to go into a wealthy neighborhood where children are neglected and adolescent suicided is the norm. Burke follows a trail of suicides leading to a medical institution that experiments on depressed teenagers. Enlisting the aid of a beautiful domentrix and a teen boy, Burke finds out the truth of how several wealthy teens are set up to die. Down right creepy in parts.Doug SetterAuthor of One Less Victim and Stomach Flattening"
3,meh...,"I'm in the process of reading all the Burke novels (I'm a BIG fan) and this one just didn't do it for me. The story was not very compelling and, unlike in Blossom, taking Burke out of NY made everything feel strange and disorienting. The interactions between Burke and the main female character seemed really fake to me and it felt very out of character for Burke in general. Anyway, not nearly as good as the other Burke novels."
3,Burke can get on your nerves after a while...,"I feel a little disloyal critisizing one of Andrew Vachss' books. I wasn't sorry I bought this because I like contributing to his cause, but this one bugged me a bit. The sado-masochistic sex seemed disturbingly gratuitous. It almost seemed thrown in to titillate the reader -- ironic, since Vachss abhors the connection ""freaks"" make between sex and violence. And listen here, Burke: You love Judy Henske,you love women with big butts (want my number?), and you respect dogs more than you respect most people. I got it. Again. Actually, I love Burke. Keep it up."
2,a step down.,I didn't enjoy this as much as the other books leading up to it. It seemed a good first draft.
3,Voices from the Trail of Tears,"I like this, but would like to see it combined with the history of where the people were who wrote the diaries, etc. I think a brief intro before each entry by the author would be appropriate. I thought perhaps this book was the result of a doctoral requirement. I have read other books that were merely the result of research without a frame of reference. I know the history since my 5x great grandparents were in that migration. But I think the book would certainly be enhanced by a note or two about where the people were at the time of the diary entry and some notes about how the ones who did make it survived."
4,Worth Your Time,"This is an important book because it includes documented accounts of the Cherokee Removal that aren't in some other books on the Cherokee Trail of Tears. I also recommend a book that follows the Cherokee author when he walks the 900 mile route in reverse from Oklahoma to Alabama, where Sequoyah invented the Cherokee alphabet: Walking the Trail, One Man's Journey Along the Cherokee Trail of Tears. Published by Random House, it was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. I saw the author, Jerry Ellis, on a PBS special this spring. Very compelling."
3,a very detailed history,"This book does provide first-person descriptions of events at the time, which is historically revealing. However, it is very dry reading...probably unavoidable. Most interesting to me is how differently the removal of the Indians from the South was viewed by different people, almost like they were talking about a completely different experience."
4,Good...But Not Good For Your Back,"Because of this workout, I have developed a bad back- and I'm only fifteen! I can't and don't want to do this tape ever again because ever since the first time I used it a year ago, my back hasn't been the same. Besides that, the workout is pretty well structured with Cindy's trainer, Radu. It's filmed in multiple settings like the beach, in a studio, on a rooftop... Some of it is in black and white and there are multiple songs throughout the workout. Overall, both workouts remind you of an early '90s music video. Oh yeah, there are three workouts. The first two are about 45 minutes and the third is a 10 minute ""Jump-Start Mini-Workout"". There isn't enough upper body toning for me and because it's focused on speed for cardio benefit, the weights used are only five pounds. I like the video overall but it unfortunately killed my back."
1,Comic Need for Speed Exercises,"I bought this Cindy workout on VHS when it first came out - it was a bit fast but I loved the exercises and music. At that time, I showed it to my personal licensed long-distance exercise physiologist - my lovely sister-in-law. She works with many different groups and individuals in her private practice and agreed with me that the exercises were great but ridiculously fast and the form needed adjustment. I agree with ""Dr Beth's"" assessment that this is no problem if you are experienced and in good health - so you do 14-16 to every 20 of Cindy's moves.The DVD, however, is a totally different animal. Everything is on super-fast forward - exercise, music, even voices. It has a comic effect; I am surprised everyone doesn't sound like Alvin the Chipmunk! Who edited this transfer to DVD? It didn't work and shouldn't have been marketed. Give me back the VHS!"
5,Decade of Devotion,"I've actually been using the workout since I was a sophomore in high school in preperation for a beauty pageant, in which I won swimsuit competition and I solely credit this workout--I'm 30 now and have wore out 2 of the VHS tapes and am now on the DVD. I actually hate working out but this DVD gets me motivated. With the 3 workout options, I can use it daily without getting bored and still feel the burn. I've had better results on my legs, buns, abs and arms with this than with any of the other workout videos/dvd's--I'm not sure if it's because I couldn't stick with those other workouts, or if trainer Radu is right on target. I'm still devoted 13 years later!"
5,Great condition,I received this product in great condition. It was still in an unopened package. I have already used this video many times. Thank you very much!
3,DVD similiar quality as old VHS tape; expected better,The item was advertised at Blu-ray so we expected better quality than the old VHS tape. It is not better.
5,Great exercise for slimming,"I think the video is excellent despite buying it ten years later errm year 2002.I really lost weight doing these exercises, great way to slim your waist. Also plenty of pause moments as this is not typical aerobicexercises.Perhaps not a valid choice for people who give up easily but more for people with the right will and attitude to loose weight."
5,Great Video,Awesome video...a little cheesy but does a great and effective workout. Easy and fun to do...quick results...A++++
3,Great Work! but got the VHS instead of DVD,"The product says DVD but it's really a VHS. I bought this one as a second and hoped the get the DVD but got the tape instead. However, I love to workout with the Cindy Crawford tape."
3,I will always love this workout video,I first bought this video back in 90s.. I gave it up because life got in the way. I found it at the thrift store that I was at and I jumped for joy because I loved this video. I immediately came home and started it up. I love love this work out lemme say this you will feel it and get results. I love Radu..I wish it more Radu talking then Cindy BUT it doesn't matter I love it all. Cindy is a beautiful woman and Im glad she did this.
4,Great Workout Video,I think this video is great. It has 3 workouts in one video. That was the first thing I loved about it. But I would only recommend this video to people that have been working out from the beginning because if you are a beginner this video is not for you. She does some great work on the legs and abs. I suggest everyone should have this video in there collection.
5,The best workout ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"I use to be 160 pounds before I started working out with the Cindy Crawford-shape your body Video. Since then I have lost 30 pounds. I loved this workout because not only did I see results, it wasn't difficult to do and I am usually pretty lazy. I have tried many other exercise video's prior to this and I strongly recommend this one because it is the absolute best."
3,Fun but defective,"I just finished the ""Shape Your Body Workout"" after not having done it for a couple of years. Since then I have tried a number of fitness videos - primarily ""The Firm"" series. So now I have something to compare this one to.The things I liked were the photography, Cindy Crawford's personality, the music, the fact that you do get a workout that makes you sweat and that you don't need too many props.What I didn't like was the queing was very spotty; Radu's counting, which was too fast and often didn't coincide with what cindy was doing; Cincy's descriptions of what part of the body was being worked, e.g. this exercise works this fatty part here; and finally, the transitions - she would begin a new exercise before I was able to get up and in position.I'm glad I have this in my library, and I'll use it because I like to rotate, but my staple will remain ""The Firm"" series - which may not have the great music, but is better in every other way."
1,Skips!,"I love this Cindy workout...used to have it on vhs. This one however, skips so hard it can't be used! I'll never buy used dvds again :/"
2,Be careful not to overwork your knees,"I agree with other reviewers who have commented here on the effect of this video on one's joints. I myself developed a very bad knee problem because of this video that lasted for months. The video is too fast so it doesn't strengthen your muscles, just puts a lot of stress on your joints. Cindy's form in this video is pretty terrible, particularly in lounges, where her knee goes way over her toes.I use this video occasionally for abwork and stretches, but when I do use it, I don't do the reps as fast as she does.Instead of this one, I would recommend the sequel to this video (New Challenge) which is quite decent."
2,misses the point,"Cindy is more concerned about looking really sexy on the video than about explaining to you the right form to do the excercices. She bounces too quickly from one to another. I am well experienced on aerobics both at home and at the gym, and really don't understand her rush. Its better to do the moves correcly and slowly... the work out its just the same but it is safer.Definitelly NOT for beginers. Yes, you can use the pause button, but who wants to do the workout with the remote control on one hand and the 5lb weight on the other?Maybe THE FIRM features the fashion form the 80's, but it is a much more complete workout and you can be sure you are doing it right because the video actually SHOWS you how to move with REAL and explanations."
3,Pretty good,"First off, who works out in a bustier swimsuit? This workout is more a music video featuring Cindy tossing her hair around. Instructor Radu is highly annoying (couldn't they have dubbed a better voice?) and does count way to fast.However, the video does make you work and is an overall good strength builder. I don't know much about safetey, but you can adapt like the last reviewer said. The workout kind of grows on you. And I just ignore Cindy's hair and Radu's voice."
2,Beware,This workout is very old. you do get a good workout. But you have to be careful that you don't hurt yourself. some of the moves she performs are outdated and can hurt you. you definitely need to pick and choose. Not an enjoyable workout. She also moves very quickly through out the work out and you find yourself trying to catch up with her.
2,Use with caution,"I used this exercise routine for a few years before I realized it was aggravating a hip problem to the point that I had to have a hip replacement at age 40. I didn't realize the pain I was having was caused by these exercises, until I stopped doing them. She moves too fast and has terrible form. Most of the exercises are great, I love the ab workout, but beware of the hip and leg movements. I learned too late the damage it can cause."
2,I'm still fat,Didn't help. I still am fat and now Cindy is making me feel old and out of shape. this is a bummer.
5,IT WORKS!,"I used this video from 1994-1995 and with cutting down the garbage I ate, I lost 30 lbs and looked amazing. Critics deemed it risky, unsafe...well I can tell you, it works, shows results immediately, and makes you feel so good. You'll use muscles that never get used, and you'll see your body tightening up right away. I started college and didn't keep up with the tape, and sadly lost all my hard work. I'm back again, with little time, and little $ to join a gym, so I'm doing this tape again, but need to purchase a new one, the old one is worn out."
5,it works for her and it works for me,"This workout video works for her and it works for me. I think it isnt for obese or extremely overweight people, maybe they should ease into it and I think only healthy people should use this video. I have turned a few of my friends onto this video and they LOVE it as I do. I have shed my pregnancy weight twice with this video.Thank you Radu and thank you Cindy! I just bought another copy for a gift for one of my friends who is always borrowing mine. I love this video!!"
5,Cindy is my hero!,"I have been using this workout since HS and no matter what kind of new workout I find, I always come back to this one. When I decide to get my strength and stamina back, I find my Cindy workout, and get to work. It's grueling the first time back, but after a week, it's easier and I feel much stronger."
5,Great complete workout (One of the Best Out There),Would like to see future Video or DVD with Radu as the trainer. One of the best Workouts I've done with great results from Head to Toe.
2,Watch your KNEES!,I did this video when it first came out a few years back. I did it religously for a few monthes until my knees started hurting. I saw no results from this video. If Cindy Crawford knew what she was doing she wouldn't have used her body monetum to lift the weight in the video. I now go to a gym that has trainers available to actually SHOW me the right form so I don't hurt myself.
2,Skip It.,"I would highly recommend skipping this video and getting Cindy's ""The Next Challenge"" video instead. On this tape, she moves far too quickly for correct form, offers very little instruction, and often gives the impression that this is a tape to show off her beautiful self, rather than a fitness tape. The Next Challenge is far superior in that she spends a lot of time on correct form, the workout is much more thorough with a wide variety of excercises, and the pace is much easier to follow correctly. Obviously, ""second time's a charm"" applies here."
4,"Nancy Drew exercises, too!","The only part of this video I use is the 10 minute all body workout. The other workouts are just too much for me. I really like the 40 minute workout on her New Dimensions video, and I use it religiously and have seen great results. However, when I don't have time to do that I do the 10 minute workout on this video, and it makes me feel great. Sometimes I do it two or more times a day. So it is worth it to me to just do the 10 minute routine on this video and skip the rest. If you are into intense workouts the other workouts might be for you. The fast pace for that amount of time is not for me. The fast pace of the 10 minute workout is great however."
3,Only if you can keep yourself safe,"I don't really recommend this video to people who are not familiar with safety. It is OLD SCHOOL form as one reviewer has mentioned. I will however say that if you know where to engage, and use total core control, it can be fun and beneficial. Radu and Cindy do not give enough cues on safety and muscular engagement. If you know how to take care of yourself by not pushing and relying on momentum, then take it for what it is---a creative workout (I have seen far dangerous dvd's in today's market). I'd like to see someone come out with a dvd that has Shape Your Body's cinematography and creativity with more emphasis on safety and controlled movements."
3,Good workout video,"This workout video is good. It gives 3 options, which is great if you don't have time to do a long workout. The variation is great and really works all parts of the body. It goes by quickly and I feel like I really got a great workout when it is over. My only complaint is that the reps are a little too fast and I sacrifice form for reps. Try ""The Next Challenge"" by Cindy Crawford. It's her second video and improved on the first."
4,3 Workouts in One,"I love this video and have used it recover from two pregnancies! The first workout is a bit hard on the knees, and I often just do the second workout! The third I know by heart as it is only 10 mins and I often will stop and do it when traveling or watching another program!It's a low-impact excellent all around motivating workout!"
4,Not just another Jersey band,"Tourmaline offers an excellent arrangement of vocals, lyrics, and sounds - making you want to listen to the CD from beginning to end. You to will see how addicting these songs become. If you haven't heard of Tourmaline yet, you will soon."
1,what did i waste my money on?,"I thought i was buying the dvd version of the the book the wicked. when i recieved it in the mail and looked at the dvd i was still excited so much i waited until i had personal time to sit down and watch it. well the time came i started it up and then i thought what the hell is this? i turned it off and thought well iwasted money before. i finally did watch it, i never saw the blair witch project just previews but thats what it reminded me of. yuck some over gifted college students wiht a video camera. when i die my kids will find this and say what the hell is this ?"
3,Beware: You Only Get FRONT Floormats,"Unlike the other reviewer's experience, I did not receive all 4 floormats. Only the front floorboard mats are provided, so beware!!! If you read carefully, the ad does say ""front"" floormats, so be careful. At this price, doesn't look like a good value for just 2 mats. How much would it have costs them to throw in the 2 small back mats. Good grief."
1,bitterly dissapointed,"i don't know what to say. this certainly won't please s&m fans. only those who have just heard about this group. i just hope this is a temporary switch to ""commercialisable"" hip hop."
1,I Hate This Album,I bought this CD the first day it came out expecting to be blown away because Monsters In the Closet didnt do well. Let me just put it like this... I dont listen to anything that comes out of Battle Axe Records anymore because of this Album.
2,Sell out!!!!!,"I have been a Swollen member fan since ""Balence"", and have loved everyone of there CD's ""Bad Dreams"", ""monsters in the Closet"". However, this CD sucks, like most other Swollen fans, I feel that they are trying to hard to go mainstream. The reason that they became popular in the first place was beacuse they had the raw original style, now all there tracks have dumbed down lyrics, club beats, and R&B hooks. I think adding Moka Only was a bad idea, all the tracks he is on sound the same and are.....jiggy! I don't understand why Swollen Members would lose the style that made them popular in the first place, I guess jiggy-rap pushes more units.....$$$. Put out another album like this and they will not be around for another....."
1,Say it ain't so,"I have nothing to add that others haven't already put down, but I need to help bring that rating DOWN. This album SUCKS. I'm a big Swollen fan but these chumps aren't Swollen Members.I read some lame interview with Mad Child where he said they basically knuckled down in their new studio and got back to roots. He felt that they suffered creatively following the success of Balance.Whatever, dude.Swollen's fallen off. I hope they get back."
2,THEY SOLD OUT,"If you like their hip hop sound before, it's gone now. You can tell they totally sold out...MIGHT AS WELL GO BUY A NELLY CD NOW. You know when and MC starts rhyming about the size of the rims on his cadilac that he is not hip hop anymore. IF YOU LIKE RAP, then you'll like this cd, but if you are looking for a sick hip hop style check out one of their older CD's like Balance. I never thought Swollen would sell out, how sad"
2,get their other albums first,"I own every SM album, am a huge fan and have heard everyone of there songs. This album does NOT contain some of there best. Progressively their music should be getting better, but here they took a step back. A few tracks do stand out in my opinion, giving that usual SM sound we all love. Personally ""concentrate"" ""bottom line"" and ""burn it down"" are my favorites on the album, while the others don't seem to do it for me. It seems like they're trying to come to the mainstream with some attempted club bangers, which they've had in past tracks without putting so much effort as they did here."
3,Oil & Water,"I have two reviews of this disc....and like oil and water, they dont mix. On one hand, big S&M fan and I'd like to give anything they do or touch the ""golden nod""....but thats loyalty, and not musical taste. Yah, you guessed it..the other hand holds a big sign that reads: ""WTF""...mindless dribble...and that &*^% about Mad Child just being broke before..snap..there go's the camels back...maybe my little sister would like this. 3 stars because, even though your son steals 5's from your wallet....you still love him."
3,myspace.com/barropanama,"i REally started listening to SM with black magic ( i had heard them since balance and had some favorite songs of them in my player ) but they get better with time... balance and bad dreams are relatively good but monsters and this one suck , except for the first three songs , the rest is for middleschool acne infested kids.. they get better with time"
3,flag pole,Nice and light weight. Problem is when it is windy the pole has blown apart into pieces. I woukd prefer a one piece pole next time.
2,Couldn't use,"This is a 1"" diameter pole. It did not fit in my standard size pole mount and instead of going through the hassle of returning it and paying for shipping I just ate the cost. I wish the product showed the diameter on its description when I bought it so that I didn't and could have saved the money."
3,"Although easy to read, this book is a lightweight.","This book is okay. The overall layout is clear, and it's really an easy read. This is both good and bad. I didn't leave from this book with a lot of deep substance. Some chapters seemed particularly irrelevant, like the future of EJB. That's nice, but a whole chapter?I would recommend this as an easy read and very gentle introduction to anyone learning EJB."
2,"Decent introduction to the technology, too much IBM","I agree that this is a decent introduction, and an easy read.I bought it to get some opinions about how to apply the EJB technology. Unfortunately, the section about applying EJB is purely about how to get IBM Visualage to generate EJBs for IBM Webshpere. Had I spent more time looking through it in the bookstore, I might have realized it is really just one of the dreaded ""IBM Redbooks"" with a fancier cover.Buy it if you need a very simple introduction to EJBs or if you work in an IBM shop, otherwise look elsewhere. I bought the Berg's ""Advanced Java 2 Development for Enterprise Applications, 2nd ed."" the same day, and so far I've gotten much more mileage out of that purchase.I'm still looking for the book on how to build a real system with EJB 1.1."
1,useless examples - too many errors,"I agree with the reviews ... But ...these commentators must not have tried to follow the examples in chapter 10, ""putting the theory to work"". There is an outrageous number of errors in the step by step procedures to build the example project/beans. After many attempts (as an experienced Java programmer) I finally had to give up on going thru the examples. What is more aggrevating is that there was no attempt to make any errata available to correct these problems. Don't waste your money on this ... ripoff !!"
2,"Painful examples, too many errors, no software provided","9/25/2001 I agree with the the reviews given before mine. This is the worst Java book I ever read. I am very disappointed with IBM to release such thing. Trust me, the first few chapters look very good. The material in the book is far from what it said in the title. That is it does not proceed by examples, but it concluded with examples at the end with very very little explanation and with a lot of errors. No software is provided in the book. IBM has changed a lot of stuff in the new version of software. I was trying to go through the examples for almost a week and I finally have to give up. I have to search for a new one."
5,Great quality!!,"These are the best shipping boots I have found to date. They are not as pricey as some others & are better quality boots than most of the expensive ones anyways. They are durable and stay clean. Very easy to take on/off, great fit, don't fall down during shipping, boot padding & thick heel protection is amazing! These are the only shipping boots I will spend my money on from now on."
1,WASTE of MONEY,THe bracelet is very nice in design - very lightweight - so not a tremendous value for gold but what completely disappointed me was that the links began to break after wear. I had to throw it in the garbage.
4,Dated but good introduction to British cartooning,"Punch for better than a century printed the best in British cartoons, much as the New Yorker prints many of the best American cartoons. While this volume only covers until 1955, it does an excellent job of presenting a representative sampling. If you're interested, it's worth paying a reasonable amount. But don't mortgage the house to do so."
5,Just Visiting,"Although this is listed as a comedy, there some interesting character studies and interaction. A Thoroughly enjoyable fim."
5,"European Nobilty, A Peasant And A Beautiful Woman. I Can Relate To That!","Every now and then they make a very funny ""fish out of water "" movie and this is one of them.A member of the Medieval French Nobility and his slave are accidently transported to 21st Century America with hilarious results. Christian Clavier gives a very funny performance which is much beter than anything I have ever seen Peter Sellers do and Ms.Applegate is a delight as always.Tara Reid also looks gorgeous and Malcolm MdDowell gives a hammy but also very funny performance in this film. Watch out for Clavier's intentions when he sees Ms. Reid being mistreated by her boss which had me laughing out loud which is a rarity for me these days when watching a film."
2,Strange FR-Hollywood combination,"I watched The Visitors and, as I just relocated to Chicago, decided to rent Just Visiting. While the main idea was kept, sadly this film has been twisted and emerged as a strange French-Hiollywood combination. The ending w/ all the police chasing, isn't that a bit too Hollywood-like? And Reno's reaction upon hearing Clavier's 'freedom' speech is too bland...I second everyone's opinion that the FR version is way better and funnier."
3,Cute Little Movie,"""Cute"" is the best possible way to describe this movie. It's not laugh out loud funny nor is it unfunny. The cast is likable and the storyline (which is more or less a remake of a French film) is interesting and imaginative. It's not perfect but it has plenty of moments. It's a great movie for families and/or couples to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon."
5,Just Visiting is awseome.,"My husband and I just went to see Just Visiting at the theatre last week. We thought it was a great movie, funny and exciting. One of the better movies that I've seen recently. We're hoping to find it on video soon, sowe can share it with our families."
5,Get GAS,"If you're interested in the small press poetry scene during the last two decades, I'd suggest getting a few back issues of GAS. It's a great record of small press poets and a few prose writers."
1,This book is already obsolete.,"Since this book came out four years ago, it has had very little impact on library technical services. The book is already long outdated and doesn't address current issues in technical services, such as MODS, MIX, etc. Basically, it's obsolete.The editor, Brad Eden, is known for his disdain for library technical services. He recently wrote ""The era of the OPAC (library catalog) is over."" Readers of this book will find his anti-library attitude reflected in the articles included in the book."
5,Russian Van Gogh,"Inventive, tragic and somehow funny, 'Vasya' is a sophisticated portrait of the Russian holy fool as an universal mad artist. A real gem.Alexander Genis, writer.USA"
3,It's OK,"For mild to semi cold weather, this works well. The fit is OK because of the Velcro fastener but with a full face helmet you have to re-tuck it up into the helmet and it take a few adjustments to get it to feel right. It's just long enough to fit under the collar of your jacket, at least for me."
4,Microfleece Face Mask,The nice part about this face mask is the Velco that lets you wrap it around you face without putting it over your head. However for really cold weather it is not very thick and there is a open mesh part in front of your month which cold air is able to come through. I would not recommmend for extreme cold.
4,Good For the Most Part,"Ok, so I know this is more for the hat helmet wearers out there, but believe it or not my face still gets frozen in a full helmet. When I initially used it, I placed it as indicated over my nose and mouth, but soon found my breath fogged everything up quickly. So it ended up being worn around my chin making a barrier and keeping the wind out all together and no issues with fogging. A little uncomfortable but aa must have during the winter mornings and nights."
3,Message Good: Printing Bad,"This book was a great way to introduce Bible stories to our two year old. Every night was a new story until we went through the whole Bible. We still read it to her almost every night, but now we skip around.The only complaint I have, and it's a big enough complaint to drop the book down to 3 stars, is the printing quality. The spine broke before we got through the book the first time! Now about half of the pages are loose, and in danger of being lost. Is there any guarantee on such things?"
3,Not the greatest.,"book is very informative, but does has some incorrect information.Use this for my History of Photography class, again informative but I wouldn't buy this book for personal reading."
4,Wowza!,"Like most history books they all tend to be wordy and seem to go in one ear out the other. Which is why people rate it the way they do. Besides the dry text that leaves you saying, ""ummm what did I just read in the past hour?"" the information about the photographers is amazing. To actually get a concept on the real history of photography, if you're in the class, I would recommend doing further research. Also don't take the class if your `interested in it', you probably need to be passionate about it and eager to learn and wanting to do the extra research to fully grasp it to the point where it sinks in. So in my opinion the textbook offers everything you need to know, just a little dry. But great great great!!!"
2,A Bit Too Large For Me,"Although this book is filled with images, I really prefer ""Photography In Print"" - see my review of it."
5,Superb! by fermed,"I have owned a copy of this book for several years and it still gets used with the frequency it deserves. I confess having been quite ignorant about the history of photography: it seemed the type of record I would not be particularly interested in (old photos are too old, and new ones are in the daily paper); but my attempt to read Susan Sontag's book ON PHOTOGRAPHY demanded precisely the nearby presence of a reference such as this one, and so I came to own my copy. The book is very thorough, deeply scholarly, and broadly based. If it has to do with the record of photography as culture it is likely to be found here. I treasure it."
1,More Mindlessness from Fodor,"Fodor once again proves that he has no new ideas and should retire. Better minds, scientific minds, will succeed where Fodor always fails. The most non-cognitive of nonsense."
2,What the HELL is this??,"This album sounds like elevator soundtrack!I almost had a heart attack listening to it.I don't have the CD and I don't want to have it never!but only listening to the samples,geez,it stinks!it's so sad that instead of releasing a new album ,the Misfits releases such an awful Cd,Project 1950 was real nice but this junk is unaceptable and don't listen to Doyle's band,i don't know if he left Misfits,if he did ,he is a traitor,the band is called Gorgeous Frankenstein and if he wants to make different music,I can't understand him!and just a remark that Michale Graves has been having plenty of bands since he left Misfits,he's a clown,but I would like to have him back on vocals.well,this cd is ridiculous!"
1,Jerry only loves money.,"This album proves one thing and one thing only: Jerry Only is desperate for money. Instead of whoring himself out on the street, or even selling crack cocaine, Jerry Only has whored out his band. Not only is the album painful to listen to, but it further destroys this bands legacy. It would appear that Mr. Only in the last decade or so has made a concerted effort to destroy the legacy of his band. This album makes a good frisbe, and little else."
4,It Is What It Is,"I gave this 4 stars because it is what it is, it's a novelty cd and that's it. But what could have been done with is more of a swing, big band style with vocals and a little guitar wow that would have been great. But all in all it's a great cd for hold music i know that's what i'm using it for or even elevator music. So all in all it's still not that bad of a cd could have been ten more on it but hey that's just me. Would have loved to hear some of the michale graves era songs on it."
1,Disappointed,"I really did like the 50's new Misfits album, and thought that this CD could be okay. It had potential, however, this is not the lounge music I expected; instead, it is techno-lounge that, worse yet, hardly resembles any of the Misfits songs no matter how hard you listen to it, sober or not. This album is a giant disappointment."
4,"its not ""the misfits"" but its no bad either","I have bin a misfits fan since the Danzig age and so right off the bat i will say ""Yes i am famliar with thier orriginal works too, i dont just say ive bin a fan"" and ive just gotta say people have to stop treating this like a Misfits album and more like the Sam Elwitt album that it is.NO this is NOT new misfits, i may say its Jerry only selling out but still you should not turn to this looking for new music, this album is more aimed for the die hard fits fans who sometimes just want to listen to somekinda hate without the lyrics....final word, yes i know not everyone will like this album but simply do not bash it because its ""misfits sellig out"" but judge it on what it is, a misfits tribute alubm done in lounge club style music and nothing more"
1,Jerry Only's retirement fund grows stronger!,"C'mon,ever hear of beating a dead horse? Well Jerry Only and the like have been beating the same one for nearly ten damn years. We love this Misfits with glenn,we know the songs,we have bought oodles of merchandise now just let it die before you destroy everything glenn danzig built. I mean how many Big Screen T.V.'s playing the Scream video over and over does Jerry Only need?"
3,Misfits Meet The Nutley Brass,"It's a good album. Nice for an occasional listen. But casual Misfits fans be warned, this is an instrumental lougne album. Only for hardcore Misfits fans and Nutley Brass fans."
1,aliance ethnik,"salut alliance ethnik j'espere que vou etes bien arrive, merci beaucoup pour le concer c'etait superbe,revenez"
4,Excellent . Where are the tough questions though?,"Covers almost every type of grammatical mistake in sentences.However , given that the GMAT throws complex questions (involving more than two error types) once you are in the 700+ range , More (and tough)Practice Questions are needed.THE 6 ONLINE CATs are somewhat difficult."
4,Worth the money,"If you are serious about getting into top B school then 15$ is a trifle amount for this book. Although book itself does not have many excercises but the online material that comes with the book alone is worth more than 15$. This book has some tricks which I couldnt find in most other books and since Sentence correction was the only department where I wasnt scoring correctly over 95th%, I had to get this book.With this book you can take 3 online CAT exams. To give you an idea I took the third exams 1 day before GMAT and got 760 in that. Guess what my GMAT score was? 760.In the end if you are serious about getting top score you should get this book."
1,DO NOT BUY,"The most annoying of all in this book are the examples cited. This book claims to be edited, tested by people who scored 99 percentile on GMAT and still there is no originality! All the examples are cited off from the GMAT verbal workout or from GMAT review 11th edition. After each concept an exmaple is cited which we cannot attmpt as there are no choices available. The book goes on and on as to how to correct the sentences which is not the case in GMAT. We are not taking the test to correct it, we taking the test to pick the best of the options and to score it. In short, though this book is strong in concepts, I would not spend $16, rather would prefer to buy Kaplan Test book or GMAT Verbal workout, etc. Anyways you will endup buying books from GMAC for sure..."
1,"Weird, Useless","What a didactic little tome! The concept of ""self-study"" should necessarily entail the use of materials that demystify a given topic; this book unfortunately achieves the opposite effect through a strange vacillation between overly pedantic musings and incomplete explanations. A more conversational, accessible writing style would be of greater benefit to the dilettante grammarian. If you've hated reading my review thus far, for instance, you would dislike this book immensely. If you're looking for erudite treatment of a topic that should be presented simply, buy this book or the GMAT Official Guide. If you want a more functional analysis of sentence corrections, I recommend you look elsewhere."
2,The title and the poster are the best thing about this film.,"Despite the good cast, decent acting, and an insulting cheat of an ending when you discover who has been doing the killing. Some of the characters' traits go up anddown; this way and that. The fault is most likely on the script. The production has the feel of a made for tv movie except when delving into the the sleazy sheen with the back alleys, prostitutes, and mud wrestling scene. Not bloody for a ""psycho-killer"" film,, just boring. The relationship between the two brothers has a few nice scenes and Joanna Petit is fine as usual (but deserves better). Cleavon Little has a throwawayrole as police sergeant, (he too deserves better). If you must see this, pick it up in one of those 50 movie packs from Mill Creek."
3,"Easy Reference for Gun Enthusiasts, but has many flaws about photo","This book contains some very useful and interesting information about current tactival small arms. However, it does have some significant flaws. This book is black and white but the photos are not good. Many photos (about 40%) in this book are unclear. I had saw these photos in internet. I think that these photos are just direct copies from internet. These photos are just printed by poor computer printer and no professional treatment.Many books about small arm are in my collection, but this one is out. I wish it will be better in next edition."
2,Too many inaccuracies!,"I was looking for an update for Hogg's classic ""Military Small Arms of the 20th Century"", however, this book. The pictures are often poor in quality or detail. For example, the photo for the Walther PP/PPK series is in fact a pellet gun (toy).Many details are simply wrong. The problem is if some things that I have knowledge about are wrong, how can I trust any of the other data?"
3,Good,"Questo libro è utile per riconoscere un' arma quando viene vista in un documentario o in un film, le descrizioni sono un po' sintetiche e le foto di non grande qualità. Comunque considerato il prezzo di Amazon, per noi italiani si può acquistare..."
2,This book is not good,"The book was not that we'll written, it is hard to follow at times. This company needs to step up when writing texts for educational use."
5,breakthrough artist goes from cell phone ring tones to runaway music charts hit!,"I must preface this review by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the Crazyfrog ring tones. When I first saw a commercial for his ring tones while watching room raiders on mtv, I just HAD to get them on my phone. ..and for only $2.95/week, it was hard NOT TO that is such a good deal and my mom said its ok! Later that day, my phone rang while I was in this club wearing my totally kewl artifically aged von dutch mesh trucker's hat that I got at the mall, and of course my radical cell phone equipped with crazy frog doing the motorcycle. I picked it up and it was my mom saying to be outside the black bear in hoboken no later than 11pm so she can pick me up... but i still looked so kewl when it rang i kno it.But anyway this album is so awesome!!!!1111oneoenbbq 5 stars totally all the wayy! i just wish that crazy frog did more stuff like dis!"
2,"Just remixing a classic song and putting ""ding ding"" is not convincing.","I am a huge lover of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and the theme song and when I heard this I instantly got irritated. I mean come on! they just stole the frog thing from a funnyjunk thing called ""The Insanity Test"" that was created 3 YEARS AGO. So overall, why mix a classic song and ruin it when it's already cool?"
1,Crazy music for crazy people,"I'm speechless. The evil entity known as (shudder) Crazy Frog has completely and totally obliterated the integrity of the original ""Axel F"". I'm not at all fond of the little mutant. I wish it would go away as soon as humanly possible. I don't think any human being on the face of this earth could stand this for more than a nanosecond, and yet people like it! Scary."
5,The best volume of the best series!!!!!,"This is the best Dragonball Z manga book since volume 12. In this graphic novel, Goku has just been stricken by the heart virus, while the Z fighters get their butts kicked by the newly awakned Androids No. 17 & 18. After getting his butt kicked by Android 17, Piccolo goes to Kami-Sama's Palace to fuse with Kami-Sama. But Kami wants to wait to see what will happen...... As seen in Viz's Shonen Jump Magazine. If you don't understand what i'm saying its best to read Vols. 1-13 before this one( they all are pretty good.)"
4,Devoted to Christ,"Anisha Blake is experiencing the Christian single dating blahs when she meets Tyson Randall, a man she hopes is the man she has prayed so long for. Ladies, we know this situation all too well.McCollors writes with elegance, grace, and a girl-next-door appeal. Good debut."
5,Great Deal,I was a little apprehensive when I ordered this Chandelier -- the price (so low) made me think it would look cheap. It looks great and I am very pleased. It looks nicer than the picture and is not overstated. It served my purpose perfectly.
5,Ford speaker harness,This wiring harness is an adapter for after-market speakers to utilize OEM speaker wiring on Ford and Mazda vehicles.
4,Keeps kids busy,My son loved this! It doesn't hold up too well once put together but he had fun building it.
2,I can't find anything on pivot tables,"I already knew almost everything in this book, so I was disappointed when it arrived and I started looking through it. I ordered it hoping it would give me a simple explanation ""for dummies"" on what pivot tables are and how to create/work with them. They're not even listed in the index!This book is great at covering all the very basic how-tos for someone who's never worked with Excel before; but it doesn't delve deeply enough into what the program can really do."
2,Just a Manual,"This is just a version of the manual without any sample exercises or anything. If that's all you need, its fine. I needed a tutorial with exercises, sample data to play with, etc. I found just what I was looking for in ""Excel Personal Trainer 2003"" which includes a cd with a lot of sample sheets and step-by-step exercises. In that book, the tutorial loads by itself but you have to manually copy over the sample spreadsheets.BTW, I am actually using Quattro Pro 10 from Corel/Wordperfect but most things are the same or close enough to figure out."
5,I can be a dummy at a lot of things...,"...but this is step-by-step and easy enough to folllow along, I'm glad I bought it to help teach myself Excel....."
4,Excel 2003,"Very well laid out, concise, and thorough discussion on how to get the most out of using Microsoft Windows Excel 2003."
4,Using Excel 2003,"On the whole the book is a good means of learning the basics of Excel 2003. I have been using this programme for some years but only recently started to integrate it into the idea of setting up a means for keeping the accounts in a small business. So far so good however it may turn out to be a slow process, when compared to a dedicated programme, but much less expensive. I would reserve my judgement for a time in order to prove how use can maintain its convenience. Amazon's service is good and has stood me in good stead for several years. I would not hesitate to go to them to find solutions, and to use their services"
2,Not worth it.,"I am an accountant. I was extremely disappointed in this book. Not well structured at all. It doesnt seem to know if it wants to be a reference book, a book for beginners or a book for those that have Excel knowledge and want to figure out the different features.In the end the book is a help to no one."
2,dazed and confused,"The layout of this book is very confusing, in every waypossible, althoughthe writer tries to make it look like it is good."
2,I am not that Dum!,Generaly a weak book unless you have never used Excel. I got the book because I needed help with graphical display of data.If that was your problem this book will not help you much.
1,Lame,I needed a book to help me quickly find methods for specific tasks in Excel. This book didn't give me fast answers. The index was no help and the cutesy jargon was just irritating. It's a shame because the For Dummies series is usually quite good.
4,Another great entry in the series,"I really like this series. Each entry is a fun little read and although they are out outrageously unrealistic plot-wise they always feature a sweet, sexy romance. Though Ryo and Dee's relationship is still stalled in this entry but they have several ""awww"" moments when Dee gets injured and Ryo reacts. Carol is turning 18 and Bikky wants to get her something special but his methods leave Carol wondering if he has lost interest in her. Their relationship finally gets going in this one and it's cute stuff.My only complaint with this volume, and the few before it, are that other than Ryo, Dee and Bikky most of the other male characters look so similar that I often can't tell one from the other especially Drake/JJ/Det. Rose and a few others that pop up here and there."
2,Zero difference between medium and high,"I bought four of these, as we're changing all our bulbs to compact flourescents and all we had left to change were the 3-ways, but I was disappointed in the light. It's fine ambient light, but three-way bulbs are purchased to have the best of both worlds - ambient lighting when you're sitting around and a good solid light when reading. This light isn't really bright enough for reading - and it's for all intents and purposes a TWO way light, not a three way - I found quite literally NO difference between medium and high. Also, you'll find a lower price at your local discount *mart."
1,Hums and is more like a 2 Way Light,"This 3-way CFL hummed in every 3-way lamp I own. There is little if any noticeable difference between medium and high. It's also more of a ""Soft White"" bulb than a daylight bulb at any setting.The bulb I received was in less than perfect condition. Parts of the white powder inside must of shifted during shipping.It's hard to tell by the dimensions listed, but this bulb is huge. The base unit is a lot larger than your traditional CFLs."
3,3 way that is really a 2 way,"I am switching my whole house over to CF Bulbs. All I have left are 3 way and dimmable.These are essentially 2 way bulbs, so if you really are looking for the 50/100/150, this isn't it.It's a fine 2 way bulb."
2,Arrived broken,"For some reason, this bulb was packaged in a snug-fitting thin cardboard carton which offered virtually no protection against breakage. I got a refund, but that hassle could have been avoided if they'd packaged it better."
1,Dim bulbs,I have yet to find a compact fluorescent bulb that gives out the same amount of light as the incadescent wattage bulb the manufacturers compare it to. And this is one of the worst.
3,3 way compact fluorescent bulb,"There are 3 settings, one bulb, must vary voltage, difference in brightness for each setting is much less than for incandescent bulb.Not worth the high price."
1,Useless,"I can't say enough bad things about this product. I bought an expensive three way lamp and was trying to be considerate of the environment by buying a fuorescent bulb. Unfortunately when I first screwed it in, it only worked on the middle wattage. The others flickered beyond usability. I even thought I could live with that, i mean, who really needs three different brightnesses on a lamp, but when I turned it off and tried to go to sleep, I found that it flicked light every 5 to 10 seconds. I even tried to live with THAT thinking it was probably my new lamp. No. I bought a regular three way bulb and it works fine. I then but the bulb in my gym bag to take to the office to send it back. It somehow managed to shatter even with the utmost care and caution so I can't even get my money back and also got a nice little dose of mercury to boot.I don't know if it was the brand, the lamp being incompatable or what but I don't think I will be trying this again any time soon."
1,Lasted less than 2 months!,"These bulbs are dimmer than most CFLs, are slow to turn on, and after less than 2 months they made lots of noise and stopped working on all 3 settings. I have other CFLs that have lasted years. These are horrible. Do not buy this brand!"
2,Description Makes False Claim,"Purchased two of these 3-way compact fluorescent in January 2007 from Amazon. Bought them for a brand new pair of Stiffel 3-way bedside lamps (purchassed at Bed, Bath & Beyond). One bulb failed December 2009. So it almost lasted three years. Far from the 10-year bulb life promised in the description. The lamps are not switched on and off too many times a day. The lamps are not left burning for hours upon hours. Normal use. Both lamps are plugged into the same surge suppressor. When they work they work pretty good. No problems with any of the light levels. They do take a few minutes to ""warm up"" to full strength."
1,"Outdated, and not very readable",Buy a newer version. This one doesn't even mention FLASH DRIVES!!! Save your time and money.This just isn't worth it
4,Word 2003 for Dummies,"Overall, very good. Too much fluff and had to go through it to get to the meat of the subject. Should have tabs for each section, as I had to go to the index to find something repeatedly. I created my own tabs from sticky notes. Should include a section on using pin drives. But, I learned a lot."
4,So Easy a Caveman Can Do It,This book makes the use of Word easy. In simple directions and discussion it takes one through or around the complications of using Word fully. It is just what it says and makes Word so easy that not only dummies can makes sense of the process but makes it possible for the caveman to leave flint Knapping and enter the computer age.
5,Book Purchase,"This book was exactly what was described. It will be very useful and was purchased at a great price! Also, it was delivered in a very timely manner."
1,poor service,Product was as expected but seller performance was poor. billed me on date of order but didn't ship for several weeks.
2,Too Simplistic,"I found this book to be too simple to be useful. It is truly for those who have not used Word, not for those who have some proficiency and are hoping to learn more about all the features of Word 2003. This is the first of the ""Dummies"" books I have purchased--and it will be the last!"
2,Somewhat helpful,I found the answers to about half my Word problems in this book. I found the other answers fairly easily online. I should have looked online first.
1,Not Good At All,"This book is horrible. The author has many inaccuracies, for example, Boulanger opened his restaurant in 1765, not 1745 as Linda indicates. She completely leaves out the Ottoman Turks who play a significant role in the Crusandes and cuisine, and she constantly bounces back and forth with dates and places. If you are a hobbyist and have time to spare, you may want to start reading to form your own opinion, however if you seriously want to know about the true history of food, I would not recommend this book."
2,Not recommended,I agree with the previous reviewer. The writing is juvenile and can get annoying. I would not reccommend this book for those who want a history. There is not much historical analysis. It is more of a compilation of rather trivial information.
3,Food is not the stuff of which history is made,"What the other reviewers say is truth. However, the author barely explains how food has influenced on human history. Then, we become essential for food, which needs us to achieve its function, i.e., to be eaten, not the other way round.I would much rather reccomend ""Food in History"" by REAY TANNAHILL."
4,"Coby TF-TV705 7"" Portable Widescreen LCD TV","THE ITEM SOMETIMES D'ONT HAVE SIGNAL BECAUSE THE ANTENNA IS NOT PERFECT, BUT I LIKE THE PRODUCT.NOTE: THE DELIVERY SERVICES IS VERY BAD, BECAUSE DHL LEAVE THE PACKAGE IN THE DOOR, SO IF SON BODY TAKE THE PACKAGE HOW RESPONSE FOR THIS PACKAGE, I CALL TO DHL FOR PICKUP THE PACKAKE, BUT THEY LEAVE IN THE DOOR, SO IS VERY BAD THIS SERVICE."
2,Didn't Work,"I personally did not get any decent reception at all on this little unit. And that is with the major stations in this area being a mere 20 miles away. I see where many others here seemed to have acceptable results with this TV in various places. But if you live in the northeast, be aware that for me it was a total flop. I will note that I was able to return this unit for a full refund without any hassel. Kudos to the company for that..."
1,bad review,"Sorry about this LCD television. After only 3 weeks I had to send it back. I started getting only 6 channels, and that's with it hooked to cable."
4,"Coby 7"" TV","Bought this product as a surprise gift and it was a huge success. Great picture on cable, marginal on antenna. We recently had a party and the product got great reviews."
3,Don't have much to compare it to...,"Picture is good. Reception is fairly minimal without cable hook-up, which is the point. 2-4 local stations, max., but I imagine that is a consequence of where I live more than a product defect. ?? Perfect size (small). I agree with many other reviews in that being able to turn unit on/off with the remote (or at least in a more accessible spot on the unit) would add to convenience."
4,Very Nice Little TV,"This TV picks up off air signal better than other TVs I have used. Yes, the normal 4:3 signal is stretched to fit the screen, which is a little weird, but it is not too much of a hassle. I love that it has a bulit in rechargeable battery in too, so you can walk around the house with it. The AV input works great, and the additional power cord for the 12v DC (car, boat input) is really nice."
1,Frustrating,I couldn't figure out how to use this program. It was very difficult to figure out so I finally gave up.
1,"""Do not rely solely on the information presented""","What they stated is true, and most diabetics are always interested in lowering their glucose numbers- I discontinued the Ceylon and replaced with Tri-C, and was dismayed with a six (6) point increase in my mg/dl after eight days of use..."
1,Didn't feel a difference,I took these pills for Like a month and nothing I think It even made me crave more or maybe they weren't absorb well ???
4,Page Turning Adventure,"I was pleasantly suprised by M. Werner's skills, keeping the reader interested and engaged in both characters and plot throughout.The characters have more depth than one might expect from their almost comic-book stereotypes, and the pacing and plot keep you wanting to finish just one more chapter before putting it down.One minor weakness is the villians of the tale, who don't seem to receive enough attention to really bring them to life. They're made disturbing more from shock value than a genuine ""creepiness.""Overall, I'd say that M. Werner is one of the top three in Black Library's stable."
2,Tries too hard,"People wandering around trying to be goofy is one thing, people wasting the time of real estate agents, Aircraft leasing agents, and car dealers is something alltogether different. These people make their money selling, a concept he seems to be oblivious to. This guy may be hilarious in person, but on camera it does not come across. Instead he seems like a non stop search for a line he can be witty with, and it grows tiring quickly.Wandering around wasting other peoples time for his amusement is at least for me, just that. A WASTE OF TIME. I am glad this preview was free, I would have been pissed had I actually paid money to see this. Sorry but I call em as I see em."
3,hoping for more,Lancome Le Stylo Waterproof Long Lasting EyelinerGoes on very nice but doesn't stay put...............not waterproof!!!!
4,Bom,"O lápis é bom e macio, mas mancha um pouco sim, mesmo sendo a prova d'água e, isso foi o que me decepcionou, pois é lancome."
2,Informative but dissapointing,I was very dissapointed when I received this book; I thought it would be larger and the pictures would be in color (not many pictures) - I did read the book and it was very informative - I wish that Amazon would put the dimensions of their books in their description
4,indian vibes and why this is bangin',"looking for 4 on the floor breakbeat ideas with eastern influences? this song was best known in a version by vibe player dave pike. the credits go to volker/kriegel. it is a great fusion of heavy bass with a sweet and simple sitar melody. the sitar version on this collection is not as killer as the original, but funky just the same. it is a standard in my nightly sets as a dj in los angeles. worth noting: the sitar is played by paul weller (the jam, style council). several versions of the same song on this cd. glad i bought it when it was cheap. pretty pricey now, but the original by dave pike is almost impossible to find and even more expensive. good luck and if you are looking for more indian influenced jazz/funk try ""bombay the hard way:"" vols. 1 or 2."
5,"Good to dance, good to relax...","Tired of the usual beat, of the usual things... well, trust me, this one is a trip to India, made by frogs in France... you can dance, or just close your eyes and relax... a mix of indian sounds with a kind of techno stuff... pretty different from anything so, it's difficult to describe... although most of the 7 tracks are the same, they are different from each other!?!?! explain me this!"
1,Rip-off,I couldn't help my self. i had to sign up just because of the ridiculous price on this horrible compilation. at my local record store in toronto they are selling the exact same cd for $4.99. this is a joke.
5,A deep and scholarly analysis of the origins of liberal democracy in Germany,"Professor Beachy's book counters a long scholarly tradition that discounts the importance of bourgeois urban life and politics on the development of liberal politics in Germany. He makes a compelling case that the political dynamics of Old Regime Leipzing, which emerged from local practical politics about taxation and private property, had a profouind effect not only on Leipzig as a citym but also Saxony as a state well into the Nineteenth Century.Beachy's study bridges the chasm of the Napoleonic Wars and counters the thesis that German politics was necessarily an exception to patterns of liberal development elsewhere in Europe, such as England, France and the Netherlands."
1,Not what I paid for,I purchased a 20 oz shaker of Tone's Rosemary Garlic Seasoning and received a 6.25 oz shaker. Don't you think we can't read? Please fix it.
4,pure nostalgia!,"the last 6 tracks on their own form a mini-album!the rest is true greatest hits collection - my only complaint being the edited version of ""december"", cutting short the soaring guitar solo! ""drowning"" - when i first heard this song, it caught my breath, i couldn't believe how good it was!the alternative versions of ""flowers in our hair"" & ""the dreamer"" were a pleasant surprise.""the mystery we are, languishing on the ocean floor"" - (undiscovered treasures)."
2,Overbearingly clunky,Noticeable debut from the eccentric rapper still falls on the side of annoying from wordy excess delivered through modest production.
1,Pretentious Windbag,Aesop Rock sucks. Pretentious white windbag. Cop the new UGK or some Sean Price and listen to some real rap music. This dude blows.
4,brilliant,"Coming from Wisconsin, it can be difficult to find any hiphop that provokes any type of real thought (with the exception of the Rhymesayers a few hours away). Aesop manages to accomplish this, addressing important social issues (i.e. the worthlessness of television and it's manufacturers). Not only does he state his case, but he does so with a tight delivery, over tracks that do like Aesop and rock. Pick this up, increase the volume and pay attention, damn."
4,one of the best written hiphop albums ever...,"too bad the production does'nt equal up to Aesop, all the Blockhead beats are incredible, and the Omega song is too, but Aesop's production is the crutch of this album, I wish he would've just rhymed on this one, or wrote, or do whatever it is he does vocally, its amazing, its like this avalanche of wordplay bombarding you from all over, its like an execution with words emulating bullets coming from all directions, this man will make you feel the panic of his words, this album to me is about being isolated in New York and forcing yourself to look outside your window, its an amazing point of view coming from an amazing artist like Aesop..."
5,Hawaii 5-O is a 5 out of 5,"One of the best and longest running police series with an archetypical hero. I have waited years for these and it is worth the wait. I watched the uncut Pilot episode and have seen the first disc in two days time. A fan? Buy this set. I read it sold out in a week's time so get it ordered. I for one am trying to place my early order for Season Two! ""Book 'em, Danno!"" lives on."
5,Hawaii Five-O,"Wonderful! Beautiful scenery, superb acting, great story line. I am enjoying watching these episodes over again. What more could one want."
5,Hawaii five-O first season,Fun to see this old show and how they incorporated beautiful Hawaii into the story line. A bit corny but still loved it!
3,Hawaii Five O the first season,Just as I remembered. Some of the reproductions were color faded and video sub standard. I have ordered the second season. Can't help myself!!
5,DVD purchase,"Purchase a used product for the first time and got a great bargain, excellent condition arrived in just 3 days with standard shipping."
4,Well...it's about time,"If you want to go to old school cop shows this is the top oneThe theme music alone was memorable,filming the show in Hawaii,I wasin elementary school when this show use to come on television.I can'tremember to much about the series except the theme song,actors Jack Lordand James MacArthur.Rates up there with other cop shows from the 70's:Mod SquadThe RookiesDragnet(color)Mission Impossible"
4,good price if you can still play vhs,as the title insinuates.... got these for an old fan of macGarret .. wheelchair bound.
5,HAWAII 5-0 AT HIS BEST!,"A classic in crime/detective movies - now on DVD, finally.I was waiting to long, but it was worth!Pictures of Hawaii and scenery clear and crisp.This is a must to see.AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!I want more of this."
4,Classic series finally surfaces on DVD.,"Jack Lord's classic series finally arrives on DVD. It looks great! Colors are bright and vibrant and we actually get a solid extra. ""Hawaii Five-O"" ran from 1968 to 1980 and was a fixture on CBS' schedule pulling in solid ratings throughout that time. Lord played former Navy officer Steve McGarrett who dealt with all manner of scum in the 50th State. As someone else pointed out, this is the granddaddy of the modern procedural show (along with some of Jack Webb's series)and, no doubt, inspired such shows as the ""CSI"" franchise.This set has the original uncut 90+ minute pilot (which was cut into two episodes during syndication)as well as the entire uncut first season of the series. We also get ""Emme's Island Moments: Memories of ""Hawaii Five-O"" a locally but professionally produced behind-the-scenes glimpse into the making of the show which features interviews with cast and crew members.Paramount has done a terrific job with this set. I say ""Buy 'em Danno!"""
5,"Cool, baby!","This show is right on, man.....it really makes the scene and is far out. It really is my bag. It's so cool and boss even chickies will dig the rap. Yeah, man, score one for the establishment! I'll be chillin' for season two."
5,WONDERFUL,"Insert disc 1 and on comes that wonderful, inspiring, terrific theme music. There's McGarret on the hotel patio and the waves rolling in. I'd forgotten the change in Danno from the first show to the first of the actual series. James McArthur was SO terrific! This was a terrific present - one of the best I've ever received. Can't wait for the next seasons...."
5,One of the greatest police shows ever!,"I must have seen every episode when this was a television series. Great actors, excellent scripts and wonderful scenery from Hawaii. A great police drama series -every episode is filled with action and adventure. Looking forward to each new issued series."
5,Great set; one of the best TV shows ever!,"These shows are even better now than they were when they were made! I LOVE my set, and want year 2 NOW! It's nice to see a better time, when cops shot to wing somebody, and not to kill, unless it was necessary. And these cops are not brutal and obnoxious, like the ones on TV now. This show had everything! Great writing, great cops, great scenery, great acting, and great guest stars! And the music was absolutely the best! To me, this show is one of the best drama shows ever, and this is a great set to buy! I will be buying every year they come out with! To me, this is the best out of all the DVD sets I have. Incomparable!"
5,Old School TV at it's Finest,"If you are going from the beginning, this is the first episode where McGarrett is in action (on the scene) for the whole show. McGarrett is forced to examine all options, always insisting that he go straight in, up the front. Although Danny is incapacitated for the duration, the rest of the (extended) unit works the situation beautifully."
4,Nostalgia At It's Best,"I always liked the show when it was on the air and it is even more fun now to watch the whole season with no commercials. The plots are fairly good with lots of familiar stars, the dialog a bit dated, and McGarrett and his team invincible. Lot's of fun!"
4,Holds up very well,"I was growing up in Hawaii when the show first aired, so I have sentimental memory's about the series. I wanted to see if it held up as a straight detective series and I think it did."
1,"shallow, geared toward complete MIS novice","This is a SAP 101 book. Paragraphs on things that should take chapters if you are looking for any kind of detail. While there are no real good books on SAP, there are better ones than this for your money."
5,Great product...fast Shipping!,I wear this almost everyday...better than sun screen. Love to support L.A. Teams...Can't go wrong with this item. Very stylish!
1,Strange Hat....,My husband says that this hat looks like a railroad conductor's hat. It's really strangely made. I wouldn't recommend.
5,EXCELLENT TRANSACTION,"Needed several hats for the summer,live in Vegas and summers are horrid here,anyway as usual went to Amazon and found these high quality caps for dirt cheap,they are even endorced by MLB,,bought just enough to get the super saver shipping,and it always makes me smile that theres never any tax :)total cost less than $40.00,total time for order to my hand 3 days..OUTSTANDING PURCHASE !!!!!"
4,"Good quality baseball hat, if you're Dodger fan you will like it","For the price, this baseball hat was a steal when I bought it. It does not feel cheap and it certainly is about $20 less than what it would cost at Dodger Stadium. Dodger blue color is accurate and the LA stiching is of high quality too."
5,Hands Down...The Character Rigging Book,"Until I read this book Rigging was always a challenge and something I avoided. This book clearly explains not only the buttons to click but the basic concepts needed for anyone that wants to rig. Then when you have mastered the basics he walks you thru complex, power, but easy to setup rigging setups.As an Instructor I recommend this book not only to my students but also to high end studios. Jonny has written the ""Rigging Bible"" in my honest opinion.I hope we see more from this talented artist!"
3,Nice books for somebody who want to repeat steps,This books are quite complete to tell you all the things you have to do to make a rig. The only problem about this rigging books (because there are 2 books from this author) is that he don't explain you why you should do those things.
2,Not Genuine Leather!,"This book is not real leather as advertised, it is that fake pastic paper stuff!"
4,Somewhat disappointing conclusion to the NML saga,"This volume, the last in the five volume ""No Man's Land"" series, was a bit of a disappointment. While it still contains the high quality artwork of the previous four volumes and the dialog is still crisp, the sudden and relatively easy ending of the No Man's Land region was somewhat light in effectiveness. Despite all the regions controlled by marauding gangs, the power of the super villains and one year of extreme chaos, the prospect of peace and food was almost enough to restore civilization to Gotham City.Much of this is probably due to the expectations that were built up. The four previous volumes were so loaded with tension and excitement that you expect the final act to be first to last caption action with a dramatic conclusion. It ends with a celebration of a New Year and era dawning in Gotham City, yet there is sadness at the gravesites of two major figures in this series of adventures starring the Batman."
3,A Fair Ending...,"So, the first couple volumes of ""No Man's Land"" were excellent, possibly the best part of a series I have ever read...then came volume three. Starting with volume three, each story was hit and miss. Some were good, others were mediocre, and some...far below the 'good' line. This one is pretty much more of the hit and miss. However, it has a great ending that I'm pretty sure would please anyone who likes Batman at all. Not as great as the first couple volumes, but definatly not a waste of your time or money, ""Batman: No Man's Land, Vol. 5"" gets a 3 out of 5."
5,Great Product,"This product is absolutely adorable. It is very well made. My daughter loves it. It has a bannana, and apple, a complete cheese sandhich with lettuce and tomato. The picnic basket is just as adorable."
1,Potentially dangerous,"I got this 3-pack from PetSmart for my German Shepherd. I read the package, which made it perfectly clear that these were ""highly digestible"". My dog is a heavy chewer even at 7 months, so it sounded perfectly fine for her. She ate the entire Spearmint flavored one in about 20 minutes or less. Everything was fine until about 2:00 in the morning when she woke me up, needing to go to the bathroom. The result? Explosive diarrhea. HORRIBLE. After that, she woke me up almost every hour on the hour to go to the bathroom, each time resulting in the same side effect from the Booda Bone. I had to take the next day off work due to lack of sleep and needing to keep an eye on her.We did not feed her any strange foods and she wasn't on any medication at the time, so I can only assume it was a result of this. Please do your dog the favor and spare him or her from the horrible stomach upset these cause. If you're that concerned with your pup's dental health, get them a toothbrush."
3,Wrong Product.....I Did Not Get The One Pictured!,I ordered 2 of these to use with my Copic markers. They have great little dividers and open up easily for use. For my needs I don't put anything heavy in them so there is no stress or strain on the bags. They are definitely made sturdy and I'm sure they will last forever...they are butt ugly and I will be stuck with them forever.I loved the look of the canvas bags which is why I ordered 2 of them in the first place. Very disappointed when I received blue ones that are not canvas...more like something a tent is made out of.I would have sent them back but I figured it wasn't worth it. I had already paid shipping to get them and didn't want to pay shipping again. These are not a product that is shipped from Amazon.If you are not like me and don't care what they look like=) I must admit they will do the job they were made for. If you think you are getting what they have pictured...don't order it!!!!
3,Class Required Book,"Unfortunately, this book was only available in hardcover. It is a decent book in that it does what it is suppose to do as a textbook. Wish it had more examples of what certain items were though. I liked the Project Management by Gary Heerkens better."
2,not good book,The content is not good. It is not easy to follow. Also I did not understand if I bought a Project Management book or religious book. Very disappointed.
1,piece of junk,a piece of junk don't buy it that's about it.i can't think of nothing else but a piece of junk. Not the place that sold it to ME. >Who ever made it<.
4,Nursery Rhyme Treasuries,Brings back some great memories from childhood that I can now share with my children. I recommend purchasing this book because it gives you a lot of the classics (some I don't even remember). Kids love it!
5,I know it's glue...,This is this first type of instant Kraxy glue that worked for me and I have tried 3 or 4 types. I specifically needed for conecting mesh with rubber on a pair of running shoes I love. This actaully worked and now the toes on both shoes stay connected to the rubber.
4,Not precision,"The glue works well enough, but definitely not a ""precision tip"" - it is one of the wider super glue tips I've ever used!"
3,Great idea. . .falters in places,"Bears fans beware: this book takes a somewhat pro-Packer perspective on the greatest rivalry in professional sports. While there are a number of great stories in this book, it struck me as largely the stringing together of a number of interviews, without a lot else contributed by the authors. It that sense, it's primarily an oral history of the rivalry. I also would have liked more photos. Those flaws aside, it is still worthwhile reading for fans of either team. Especially those most interested in the earliest years of the rivarly."
5,"Finally, someone who actually understands the IT conundrum","What a rarity! Bob Tipton actually ""gets"" IT. Better yet, he knows exactly why it's so baffling to so many. With a unique communication style that's both enlightening and entertaining at the same time, Bob hooks his audience from the first to the last page. I read his book in a single sitting and was thrilled to find someone who could explain so many facets of an area that's so very complex.This book is a ""must read"" for those in IT as well as for those frustrated by the IT world. Bob shares wisdom beyond his years and leaves you wondering how long it will be until his next volume.Bravo Bob! The world deserves more of you."
3,packing/description,these were packed quite well but 2 goblets were received brokenalso the description goblet seems to be incorrect they are not big enough to be goblets they basically are like a wine glass but with more thicknessthey dont have the volume of a gobletr
4,Godinger Dublin Crystal Set of 12 Goblets,Arrived on time in shape. Three boxes of 4. Boxes are individually giftable. Heavy weight. Too tall for most dishwashers and some shelves.
5,as shown,"they are great, they look exactly as the picture and to my surprise they were heavy not light. perfect.they do hold 9 ounces almost full.i measured it. they seem to be slightly heavier than a mug to give you an idea. and the price i got it for is a steal, the box was marked $39.99 for 4 of them; the 12 is 3x 4pks. i highly recommend"
3,nice,"My brother and sister-in-law gave these to us for Christmas. They weren't exactly my ""style"", as I usually like more contemporary designs... but they are very pretty. They are very thick, sturdy, heavy. I'm not afraid that I'm going to chip or break them while I handwash them, and find myself using them quite often.My only criticism is that there is one tiny visible seam in the goblets. Barely noticeable."
5,DUBLIN CRYSTAL,VERY HAPPY WITH THE STEM WARE AND RECEIVED COMPLIMENTS ON THEM AS WELL. USED THEM FOR AN ADVENT TEA EVENT.
4,Godinger Dublin Crystal Set,"Very pleased with the quality and the price. The only problem was that they sent me a set of 8 and then 4 goblets wrapped separately. The company did give me a call, however, to ask if that was ok. I recommend this product."
5,These Glasses are Perfect.,They came very quickly and Were packaged very well. I love them. They matched the other Dublin Crystal I have. Very Nice. I do recomend them.Ken Gore
2,Shannon_Godinger_Macys,"Purchased by my wife over the Christmas holidays for a super price. The goblets were red and ""crystal"". However, they weren't cut ""crystal"" and didn't ring like crystal. Really crystal??"
5,Best of the genre,"The graphics are superb. The underwater chase scenes in Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace are very reminiscent of the chase scenes toward the beginning of this video.If you are a Kansas fan, you'll immediately spot the style of Kerry Livren, the musical genius behind this video. Only two tracks have vocals. One is overtly Judeo/Christian expressing that only the Creator can satisfy. Livgren became a Christian before Kansas disbanded (just listen to Dust in the Wind or The Wall).The vocal track (next to the last) is the only one I don't like. The vocalist is Kerry's son, Jacob. It would be a good song if it weren't for an unecessary, irritating falsetto part that he sings. It is very badly done.If you do not like Kansas, you will not like the music. My brother first showed me this video a couple of years ago. I went out and got it myself. As soon as I am finished here I am ordering the DVD!"
5,"Very, very, very cool.","Odyssey Into the Mind's Eye is an incredible video that showcases some awesome computer animation, and also has great music to bring the whole thing together. I used to work at a video store and I'd play this tape all the time and I had so many people ask to rent it. I highly recommend it!"
4,An extremely organized anime!,"Into the minds eye lets you take a look at a whole new perspective of computer Animation. With Vivid and Breathtaking sights and wonderful music, I would reccommend this Title To Everyone!"
3,not Amazon's fault this only a 3-star,"thought we were getting the DVD video and inadvertently got just the soundtrack. The electric music is ok, but it's not really all that entertaining without the animations.There's nothing wrong with the CD or production quality, it's just not what I had intended to order"
3,Subtract 2 stars for LOUSY music.,"I've always dug computer animation, and I love the ""Mind's Eye"" series, but this particular installment is seriously hampered by the choice of Kerry Livgren (of the prog-rock outfit Kansas) to supply the music score. Musicians previously featured in the ""Mind's Eye"" series, such as Thomas Dolby and Jan Hammer, were appropriate choices. Livgren is not. I suppose I liked the band Kansas back in the mid 1970s when I was in high school, but today I wonder, ""What was I thinking???"" Such music is hopelessly incongruous for cutting-edge computer animation showcase ... and toward the end when Livgren actually starts SINGING is when I REALLY started to cringe. The eye candy here is just as enjoyable as always; but if you buy this, make sure you turn down the sound and listen to a nice techno or trance CD instead."
3,"Great graphics, blah music","This video has outstanding computer graphics - there is no question on that. The soundtrack, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired. It was apparently written by a guitarist from the group Kansas but at any rate is pretty lackluster. The music varies between lame & dull. If I were to rate just the computer animation alone, I would give this DVD 5 stars. If, on the other hand, I were to rate the music alone, I would give it 1 star. Therefore, I chose 3 stars as a happy medium. Would highly suggest that people interested in this genre check out Beyond The Mind's Eye. The soundtrack to it is written by Jan Hammer & is far, far superior to this one. The graphics on it are comparable to this. I would still recommend this DVD to those who are really, really into this type of stuff as the computer animation almost makes up for the uninspired music."
5,Mystic Maid Microfiber cloth,"Have been using Mystic Maid microfiber cloths for about 8 years! My whole family loves them. Everytime I get new ones, my husband & son ask for one too!!"
5,mystic maid cloth,I had received this product as a gift and thought phooey. Then I tried it and could not believe how well it cleaned windows. So -- I ordered several for gifts.
5,love it,"grate cleaning cloth. I bought this cloth for my mom. She had the same before and was very happy to have it again. Shipping was fast, Item is true as described. Would recommend..."
5,A must...,"The 45-5 is a must for any archaeologist. There are those who prefer the 6-inch 45-6, but I feel that model has too much flex, which can cause you to gouge your walls.Whether you prefer the 45-5 or 45-6, Marshalltown (golden or not) is the way to go."
4,Archaeological Trowel,An old-style wooden handled Marshalltown is the only one for east cost archaeology. The Amazon price is a good one.
4,My son loves Mr. Pine!,"We really like all the Mr. Pine books at our house, but so far none are as good as the original Mr. Pine's Purple House! The story line in this one is cute, but the illustrations don't enhance the story at all, for little ones trying to understand what is actually going wrong while Mrs. Pine is away. Still a good story nonetheless for Mr. Pine fans."
4,One star!!,"Bryan's brilliant one star review made my day.I'm prepared to accept that Tatum was not the greatest player in a group setting, hence I have knocked off a star.I watched an interview between Andre Previn and Oscar Peterson where they discussed Tatum at length. Peterson pointed out that there is much more going on with Tatum than just technique.Yes he's playing scales and arpeggios, but there is also amazing harmonic and rhythmic thought going on as well.I'd be interested to know what players Bryan listens to that don't play scales and arpeggios. Most modern players are playing scales and arpeggios. The scales used are 'modes'.By the way I have nothing against 'modern' players, having a large CD collection that spans the entire history of Jazz."
3,better for tatum fans,"Yes, Art was virtually unrivalled as a soloist, but lacking as an accompanist; and Ben was virtually unrivalled in expressive tone on ballads & not bad at sassy blues-based pre-bop swing. This pairing (Ben claimed it was his favorite of his recordings) does have its moments, but would be more satisfying for fans of Art Tatum, who seemed to forget the value of musical rests & pregnant pauses in this session - too much caffeine? - and Ben seems reluctant to play any faster than ballad tempo. Still, it's fine playing & worth a listen."
5,Too Marvelous for Words,"Those of you who think that Art Tatum was merely a great jazz soloist are in for a real treat. This is still Tatum, the master improvisor with a technique that could rival Horowitz (no exaggeration). And yet when he combines his own inimitable gifts with the wonderful, breathy sounds and the laid back, behind the beat style of Ben Webster, the result is something rare in music. One needs to hear no more than their rendition of My One and Only Love to realize that this is ensemble playing at its highest level and something that is rarely achieved in any idiom of music. You are left with the feeling that you have not just listened to a great improvisation, but rather eavesdropped on an intimate dialog between two old friends. As James Lester mentions in his biography of Art Tatum, (Too Marvelous for Words, also available through Amazon), ""Ben Webster was more than just a fan of Tatum's...he idolized him."""
4,Very nice,"I actually bought these ear muffs as sort of a gag gift to give a friend moving to Minnesota, but as it turns out I really liked them and am thinking about ordering a pair for myself. They're very soft, very warm, they fit well and the price is right. One funny thing I noticed though is that they tend to ""shed"" slightly with handling, which probably isn't too surprising considering they are rabbit fur. It's not enough to be a problem - it's just interesting. My sister raises rabbits and I can tell you, rabbits shed like crazy."
3,One size does not fit all,"Let me preface my comments by saying at no time in the description did the seller state the earmuffs were adjustable. And that is the problem.The ear pieces are super nice and warm, but the headband is not adjustable. I am a small lady, and would like to adjust the head band so the muffs fit over my ears comfortably, but there is no way to do this. The muffs were nice because there is a fabric cover for the plastic head piece. But one size does not fit all, and it would have made the muffs feel ever so much better. I would have even been glad to pay the extra few dollars for this feature.I can't attest to the warmth of the muffs because we've hit that January spell in Tennessee where we've had to turn on the A/C to keep comfortable. I expect that will not last, and I'll be able to report back about the warmth of the fur."
1,Complete Garbage,"Parents, if you ever see this book in your kid's backpack, on their bookshelf, or anywhere else, THROW IT AWAY. This is not suitable for preteens or teens. Any page I flipped through led me to nothing but profanities or vulgarities. Acts of mutilation, teenagers boasting about their multiple sex acts or talking about their mother's vibrators. The list goes on and on. This book was written to exploit teenagers, parents check up on your kids to see what they are reading. There's a lot of trash out there disguising itself as literature."
2,Not wortht the money or time to read it...,I literally just finished reading this book and I came straight to my computer to write this review. I think this book was awful. I really like this author but I hated this book. It is just about 10 different people over one day. You get to barely know anything about them and then it moves onto the next person. All the character are barely connected by little things that are unimportant. You get no closure for any of the characters and at the end you wonder why you just spent time reading about them. I understand that it shows how much happens in one day but the stories barley connect to each other. I DO NOT recommend reading this book. You will feel cheated and wish you could get your time back.
4,Anthemon,"in my opnion, this is their best work... i loved every single song in this cd, its an awsome gothic metal band.."
1,An embarassment to gay literature,"If unbelievable convoluted plots, boring repetetive dialogue, and predictable stereotypical characters are your passions, then rush right out to buy Blood Moon. Otherwise, I can suggest little reason for reading this book. The gang from Okeechobee are little more than a comical circus act, fronting for some of the most unimaginative pornography to hit the printed page. Just how many ways are there to ""insert"" a tongue in someone's mouth? Unfortunately, reading Blood Moon will answer this and many other questions that need never have been asked. The best thing I can say for this 804 page debacle is it makes a great doorstop."
3,it really isnt bad but not really good..,Smell is kind of a bland perfume smell I tried it because it was on clearence lol and i see why it really doesnt smell that good but its not a horrible awful smell either.
3,Blah.,"It's a very light, very forgettable fragrance. Nothing distinct about it that would inspire one to choose it as their ""signature fragrance."" I got it for a birthday gift and I doubt I will ever be wearing it. It fades off my skin after about 30 minutes (I usually keep perfume scents very well). Maybe I will spray my linens with it because it IS a pleasant scent."
4,Baby Phat Golden Goddess,"Purchased the Golden Goddess 3.4 oz parfum spray as a birthday gift for my son's girlfriend. She was happy with the product received--it was what she had hoped for. The price for the parfum was the least costly based on my on-line searches. The only complaint is that after paying $15.95 for excellerated shipping, I think it took just a littler longer than the cost warranted. I placed my order Thursday evening, May 29, the order was shipped Tuesday, June 3 and it was received on Thursday, June 5. I thought one week was long but we are happy with the product."
3,"ok, but not the best for my skin","This product was recommended to me as part of a dry sensitive skin care regime. I find it does not irritate my skin at all which is good. But it does not moisturize enough for my very dry skin. I use it mixed with a moisturizing cream, especially in the winter."
5,Loved it!!,"If you are a Civil War buff or simply facinated by a ""Then and Now"" photograph, this is the book for you. This book contains photos that I've never seen before (both old and new) and I find it amazing that the author actually located all of these scenes in their current condition."
3,Then & Now,Interesting to read and provides adequate info as to the past and present. Satisfied though not overwhelmed as to thecontent.
5,The Gettysburg Then and Now Companion,I love Civil War history but this book was great. I'm fancinated how it changed Gettysburg then and now. I took it with me to Gettysburg to find where the location. I've been there few times. I recommeded for everyone to buy this book.
5,Ella Showed She Could Still Sing,"Granted, Ella's voice was a mere shadow of her glory years, but her control of her lower register was impeccable. Of course, her scatting, especially on ""The Boy from Impanema,"" was hard hitting. She romps through ""Somewhere in the Hills,"" and her interpretation of ""Wave"" was beautiful. She also sings a few songs in Portugese. And as if the language wasn't romantic enough, Ella delivers with perfect diction and timing. This is a CD that you can listen to with your sweetheart, some candlelight, and a glass of your favorite drink. Unfortunately, this CD was recorded about 15 years or so after the bossa nova craze hit the United States, so it didn't receive the notoriety of her previous songbooks. Again, her voice may not have sounded like it did 20 years previously, but on this recording, Ella is firmly in control."
2,I Love Ella and Jobin....but not this one!,"I have to say that this album is a disappointment. It just doesn't gel. On many Ella just doesn't sound musically involved and many of the tempos are just wrong. I have to question the choice of some of the arrangements. If you are a casual Ella fan, then skip this one. If you are a diehard Ella fan, then buy it last! If you haven't already heard the album ""Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim"", then drop what you're doing and order it; it is unsurpassed. (make sure you get the Remastered version) Also, Sinatra and Jobim started to record a sequel and the bulk of it appears on the album ""Sinatra and Company"". Buy that album for the first 7 songs, the rest of the album is 70's pop-schlock. Who knows why!!!"
3,Something's missing,"Great songs and arrangements; one of the greatests singers of the XXth Century and superb musicians but...Why did they cut the songs ""Don't Ever Go Away (Por causa de vocé)"" and ""Song of the Jet (Samba do avio)""?Ella and Jobim don't deserve this."
2,i thought i found the grail,"but, alas no. ella's songbooks and jobim's songs are the height of the craft but this does both a disservice. ella swings awkwardly against a very tepid studio-cat style bossa nova circa '81. when she cuts loose full scat she sounds comfortable but more often she's either stretching her voice or she's rushed. i thought she might collapse during 'he's a carioca'. 'dindi' sounds nice and some others but oh what could have been. toots thielmans indeed!"
2,Ella's voice pretty ragged here; arrangements shine,"Sorry to say how disappointed I was to get this CD and hear Ella sing some of the most beautiful songs ever written while her voice is past its prime. The arrangements are great, though."
3,Nice Try.,"I love Ella and I love Jobim, but her voice isn't the best here and the orchestrations don't serve him too well either. Oh well."
3,Highlights from a truly unique television classic!,"This chilling video release does indeed feature many terrific highlights from the ever popular Gothic TV series. However, this spooky compilation is for only the most devoted fans of the show because the tape skips from one suspenseful moment to the next sans narration, leaving many viewers to ponder just what events led to these shocking developments. Those who choose to relive some of these spine-tingling events will meet an 18th-century witch, a werewolf, a Jekyll and Hyde character, and of course, reluctant vampire Barnabas Collins released from his 200-year-sleep. If you find yourself pleased with this special video presentation, there is a second installment on home video entitled: BEST OF DARK SHADOWS, VOLUME TWO."
1,A total waste of money,"I bought the two best of volumes for my wife, a devoted fan of the TV series in the 70s. The first tape is an incomprehensible patch work of seemingly disconnected scenes. No plot, no drama, no value to us or for others who watched. I returned the second video for a refund."
4,I loved this movie! (I've memorized it :)),I am twelve years old and I loved this movie. My sister and I've memorized the whole movie. It is a little crudely made but it was still good.
2,Not as good as the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,"I have to admit we returned this book. Our daughter lovedChicka Chicka Boom Boom: Anniversary Editionand we thought that this would be just as good. It didn't quite have the same appeal. We tried reading it a few times and even we were bored. Perhaps it was just too much like the original, without being different enough to keep our attention."
3,Not quite as catchy as the original,"My 3 year old begged for it since the picture of it was on the back of Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, so we got it for Christmas. It's not nearly as catchy as the first, and doesn't flow very well for reading to small children. I've got to say, I'm not an idiot (I read a LOT), but I don't really even GET the storyline. My three year old couldn't even sit through it once. We tried again another day & he finally made it through, but didn't enjoy it. Maybe he'll enjoy it more when he's older? Not sure."
4,Great Book,"Even though this didn't have quite the same rhythm as the original Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, it's still a great pre-school book. My four-year old loves it."
5,Take a Trip to the Queendom of Ebal,"I sat down with this book and didn't move for two hours. Even re-reading it out loud at bedtime, I gave in several times to my seven-year-old son's plea for ""just one more chapter."" This adventure has everything it needs: a quick-thinking heroine, a mysterious aunt and her even more mysterious house, an evil dragon, a journey, and plenty of food for thought. Quick-moving prose with flashes of dry humour make this an entertaining read for adventure-lovers of all ages."
5,Rare,"This product is no longer made. Provides safe and thorough cleaning for the entire tape path. Grab it while you can, it's a must for VHS enthusiasts!High Performance VCR Head CleanerScotch High Performance VCR Head Cleaner"
5,Great For Beginners,"Fingerboard tape is very easy to use so I probably don't need to describe how it works. The color for me didn't matter so I chose blue since I don't really notice the colors so much as how they are spaced apart on the fingerboard.I know some think fingerboard tape is a bad idea since its not a natural way to learn the violin. I thought the tape would feel awkward under the strings but it actually helped me learn the notes easier. It is a great tool for beginners and especially children would benefit as long as you don't get too used to it. I can see why it could become a habit to have the help of tapes since when they are off, after you have had them on the violin for awhile your fingers and your brain feel the difference. This could be a problem for some but not for me and I can see people getting use to the tape. If you need help playing the violin I would recommend these to get you started learning."
5,Ahead of it's time.,"This is a terrific ""album"". I think it was a two record set. I'm listening to an old cassette and thrilled that it's out on CD. Buy it. I will."
5,Not just a pretty picture.....the power lies in the messages!,"When I was given these cards as a gift, I was awestruck at the beautiful artwork. I have never owned my own horse but have admired them from afar all my life. When I started reading the cards I was amazed at how much they gave me. They inspired me to make changes in my daily life and thoughts that have helped me grow and learn and aspire to become a better person. These cards are a gift that gives to me every day. I am so grateful to the person who blessed me with them."
4,Zoom g9.2tt,"I have only 1 complaint,that I cannot get a good shimmering clean Strat like sound out of it, the Distortions and Delay/Rev/chorus etc are fantasticZoom G9.2tt Twin Tube Guitar Effects Console"
3,the original theme song,"I would have rated this 5 stars if it had the original theme song. True it is still funny without it, but the original always put me in a good mood. Even today after all these years when I hear it on the radio I think of this show and smile."
2,Disappointing,"I had hoped that the original music played during the opening of the show would also be on the DVD. Sadly, it was replaced by a cheezy song that begs to hit fast forward on the remote!"
2,Another great show with another lousy DVD release,"One of my favorite sitcoms (one of the first shows I recorded on a regular basis when I got a VCR in 1980) and of course we get the version without ""My Life"" in the opening credits. It wasn't even sung by Joel, it was a cover! How hard could it have been to pay for the right version? And this is Tom Hanks, doesn't he deserve better? I wish he had picked up the tab for a decent release of his own cult show!The biggest problem is that there are no chapters in the episodes, so you're forced to listen to ""Can't Shake Me Loose"" over and over and over. A great show, and we waited YEARS for the release. Both it and the fans deserved better."
1,THEME SONG & SCENES REMOVED! PARAMOUNT RUINED BOSOM BUDDIES!,"Billy Joel's 'My Life' song is cut because Paramount didnt or couldnt clear the rights and it's absence destroys the energy of the first 5-10 minutes of each episode. Also, scenes are cut. Travesty. It's such a good show, especially to gay guys who grew up on it, and it could have been so much better on DVD if they'd just spent some money on music and extras."
2,Wish I had known,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this DVD set. I was stunned when I started watching the first disc and the familiar and much-loved My Life theme song was missing, and that was one of my favorite parts of the show. And had I known that these were the edited syndication episodes and not the original, I would have passed on this set and waited for a better version. This show deserved better."
1,Pathetic - SHAME on you Paramount,"First - I love this show when it was on in the 80's. I was looking forward in hering ""MY LIFE"" as the theme song to each episode. I was beyond shocked to hear this lame horrible song they replaced the classic that Billy Joel sang. The song was VERY much a part of the success of the show. Im very very sorry to have bought this now. I will have to think twice on any further DVDs from Paramount. It is not like they dont have enough money to fix whatever contracts they may have needed to correct this. Shame shame shame!!!!!!"
5,Bosum Buddies was AWESOME!,"One of my very favorite series EVER!! the duo of Hanks/Scalaria (sp?) was very ""right"" and I hear Tom Hanks joke about a BB movie in interviews...sure wish they'd do it!!!Would be hard to tho...the actress who played Amy is dead from cancer now. She would be hard to re-cast!RIP Wendy RIP!"
2,What a ripoff!!,"I was one of the first people to order Bosom Buddies when it came out and ran home to play it, unfortunately I hear Stephanie Mills instead of the Billy Joel song. One of the things that made this show so great is the nostalgia it brings back watching the opening sequence. I personally only got through 3 episodes because I was so thrown off by the music in the opening.I loved this show and looked forward to seeing it, however I didn't think I would have to find out that the song which is great is not the right song on the dvd. I mean come on you wouldn't play Earth, Wind, and Fire to Different Strokes! How about Eye of the Tiger to the A-Team openin! I wouldn't recommend it for now, who knows maybe they may re-release it with the Billy Joel song if there's enough complaints......"
3,I have all 3 books ... dated but approachable,"I have the Omnibus Edition of this which includes all 3 book. I was going to dismiss this as old, mainly chord based and uninspiring. However looking through it, it is not a bad introduction. I find that some of the chord strum patterns do not sound like the intended tune (a CD would have helped) -- but that is unfortunately common to a lot of older style tutorials. I did not care for the heavy chord bias and the very light coverage of lead playing and scales at the end -- but you know really, that is probably how you should learn or at least play guitar: mainly chord/rhythm with a little soloing/improvisation thrown in at the end (yes, I know it is more fun to improvise over everything!)."
5,LIKE GUITARS: YOU WILL LOVE THIS,I play guitar and enjoy hearing some of the best players perform in a relaxed venue. The DVD was the next best thing to being there with the added up close and personal aspects that even those attending could not receive. Overall it was very enjoyable and is at the same entertainment level as the 2004 and 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festivals.
4,Beck with Wilkenfeld was the high point for me,"This set is full of blues celebrities, including some I had never seen before, such as Hubert Sumlin, the great ex-Howling Wolf guitarist. There's lots of great guitar playing of course, and all the old-timers (and the youngsters too) give a good account of themselves. B.B. King, over 80 years old, is in surprisingly robust voice and plays as well as ever, though he is very overweight and played his set sitting down. But the highlight for me was Jeff Beck's incredibly imaginative and dramatic guitar playing. Though over 60 Beck has retained his youthful figure and shock of black hair, and continues to sound like a visitor from the future. Following Jeff's every twist and turn and taking her own extended solo was young Tal Wilkenfeld, an amazing talent on bass. Her solo blew me away, and it doesn't hurt that she's cute and radiates enthusiasm. It's nice to see musicians smiling instead of trying to look mean and alienated."
5,Clapton does it again: Crossroads 2007,"People talk about sequels not measuring up but that certainly isn't the case here. Clapton has once again managed to put together an amazing collection of artists doing what they do best. Granted I am a Clapton fan, but this isn't about Eric. This is about what he put together. What a treat watching some of the classics like Jeff Beck and John Maclaughlin playing live. And, in case some of you may not have noticed Beck's bass player is absolutely AMAZING....cute too. This is an extremely worthwhile investment if you like good music, not just the blues."
5,Crow must go !,"Bill Murray was right at least once when he said, ""You will remember this set the rest of your life"". He was referring to Disk 2 and the jam with Winwood, Clapton etc. But why was Sheryl Crow even allowed in Chicago on the day much less on stage with real musicians. Eric may have owed her or wanted something to allow her anywhere near a guitar. Could she have been backstage entertainment? Oh well. Despite her a great great DVD."
5,Fantastic live performance by numerous artists,owning the Crossroads concert in Texas made me anixous to buy this DVD and hear some more great music live. I wasn't disappointed and think this DVD is far better then the Dallas Texas show though that was a good one too. I had tickets to this show but because of health problems I had to miss it. So getting to buy this DVD made up for missing out an a truely fantasic experience. The second disc with Clapton and others just brought goose bumps to my skin it was sooo great. Hearing alot of my old Cream favorites also made this well worth the purchase. I should have gone to the concert. After seeing the DVD I missed out on one incredible show.
4,Mom loves it,Got it for my mom for Xmas and she had us put it in the DVD minutes after she opened it. She loves it !!! Great video quality on it too.
4,Not as good as the first!,"If you bought the first DVD and are looking for the same magic to happen on the second you'll be disappointed! If this is your only Crossroads DVD you'll enjoy the music and the interviews, but I suggest you get the first of the series. This one lacks something I just cant put into words, its still enjoyable but its just missing that certain once~in~a~lifetime magic the first DVD has to offer! Sorry Eric, I love your music and love your continued support of the Crossroads Centre but I wasn't in awe this time."
2,too much ugly heels & fender firewood,"The Best part of this CrossRoadz was the Jazz and Bluez guitarists,(2),... and the old dude with the black Godin guitar.Too much time was on an old musician dressed up like a 2 dollar back alley hooker = gross me out dude!If being sober means playin a piece of firewood with 3 singles then the Fedz should legalize something else, LMAO!!."
3,Stuck at the Crossroads,"You expect some serious guitar playing on the crossroads lineup, Most of Artists were fantastic especially Jeff Beck and Derck Trucks, but adding Sheryl Crow sing alongs really sucked. Not as good as the First Crossroads DVd."
2,Not as Good!!,I purchased this DVD expecting it to be at least as good as the first Cross Roads concert that Clapton put out. NOT!! This concert is nowhere as good as the first. Many less top artists on this DVD.
2,NOT TOO GREAT,"I WAS SORT OF DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CUTS THAT MADE THE DVD AS THERE WAS NO JEFF BECK. J.J. CALE DIDN'T NEED TO BE THERE SO MUCH EITHER. I THINK ERIC SHOULD LET SOMEONE ELSE PUT ON THIS SHOW AS HIS CHOICES OF MUSICIANS WERE SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE. SHERYL CROW? CROSSROADS GUITAR FEST MEANS GUITAR PLAYERS. THE BUDDY GUY SET WAS DAM GOOD. I WOULD MAYBE RENT THIS FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY IT AS I WAS MOSTLY DISAPPOINTED WITH IT. THAT GUITAR CLAPTON PLAYS IS ONE OF THE MOST CHEESIEST LOOKING GUITARS I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE NEXT TIME, ERIC, RELEASE THE WHOLE SHOW, JUST NOT YOUR INFLUENCES. AND IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER GUITAR FESTIVAL, INVITE SOME GUNSLINGERS, NOT A BUNCH OF WORN OUT BLUES PLAYERS."
5,Crossroads Review,"If you are into guitars, guitar players and guitar music this DVD is even better than the 2004 release. The filming is up close and you really get a feel of the emotion of the players.Bill Murray as MC is an added bonus. Highly recommended DVD."
5,Crossroads,"As always, good service. Exactly as expected. As before, disappointed in Amazon credit card company."
4,Eric Clapton Crossroads 2007 DVD,"Pretty good video. Photography, sound are nicely done. You won't see a lot of Eric Clapton, but his concerts are like that the past few years. Guests are great. Lots of variety, though quite a few are not blues. Cool behind the stage camera work and interviews, but they don't interfere with the music."
4,Great LONG show...short DVD,"This show was amazing in person (after a 12 hour drive!) and the entire thing was available streaming video for a few days after(all 11 hours) but for some reason this is VERY edited. That said, this is really the best of the day crammed into 3 or 4 hours. I wish more of Robert Cray, Jeff Beck and Los Lobos was included. Esp, Beck's A Day In The Life, which was a show highlight.Looks like almost all of Windwoods set and a good dose of Claptons is included.So you SHOULD have been there, but this is cool too!"
2,First Festival was better.,"I was at the first event and by comparison to this show I have to say that its not better the second time around. I think that the only thing this show has over the first is Beck and W Nelson . THe whole atmosphere seems very commercial and more of a concert promotion rather than a festival to celebrate the blues and other forms of music with the spotlight on guitar work. I own this dvd and rarely watch it. The vibe on the first festival is better,more like being at Woodstock since it was a whole weekend event and the cotton bowl was packed with about 65000 friendly people."
4,Are you kidding me? Sheryl Crow is Awesome!,"First of all, if you're going to trash Sheryl Crow because this is a ""Guitar Festival"", then you'll have to dump the drummers and the keyboard players, what the hell are THEY doing here? Sheryl Crow has a really nice body of work out there,(no pun) and there is no question in my mind that she is a talented musician in her own right, eye candy claims aside. This is no poser, and you can bet she worked her butt off to be where she is today. Eric gets to invite whoever he wants to his guitar festival, and I for one didn't for a second think she was ""out of place"". If I ever have my own guitar festival, I'm inviting Sheryl Crow, live with it. Tulsa Time? Are you trying to tell me that didn't just flat ROOOOOOOOOOCK?? Oh, C'mon, C'mon!"
5,"WOW, what a show!","If you're an Eric Clapton fan, a Blues guitar fan, or a live blues/70's rock/country music fan then this is the DVD for you. It is so good. I didn't like every single act, but I did like the majority and there's a LOT to pick from. Plus, I discovered quite a few musicians I'd never heard of which led to a bunch of new CDs I had to have. If you do buy this DVD, be sure to watch the extra stuff too, it's worth it! My only regret, where was I when this concert was announced? I only live 2 hours from where it was held!"
5,Best Guitarists on Earth,The players and filming are so good that I'm planning to get tickets for the next one.
5,Great gift,I myself am not a big big fan of Eric Clapton but my husband is. I bought this DVD for him and he LOVES it. He watches it and that doesn't always happen with DVDs I buy for him. He has even watched it more than once and that NEVER happens.
4,"Jeff Beck's ""A Day in the Life""","I just received this information from Sonny Landreth's Slidelines Vol. 14:""On Wednesday, Nov. 28, PBS' ""Great Performances"" series will air a special broadcast edition of the show which will feature several performances not on the DVDs, including Beck's reading of ""A Day in the Life."" Please check your local listings for details.""Actually, my local PBS station is re-broadcasting this several times over the next 2 weeks. If you have a DVD recorder, you can make up for what was left off the official DVD."
4,Eric Does It Again,"Once again, Eric Clapton puts together a wonderful show! I had heard the name of some of these artists before, but didn't know what they sounded like. Derek Trucks and Albert Lee are such examples. This show is a fine collection of performances across the spectrum (rock, country, blues). My favorite is John Mayer, who may be the next Clapton! My only disappointment is how crazy Bill Murray is. Maybe that's what they were looking for as a host, but I think they could have done better. Overall, it's as enjoyable as the first Crossroads Guitar Festival."
3,Too much editing.,"It's good for what it is, but it is missing the best tracks of several of the performers. Many people have mentioned A day in the Life by Jeff Beck, which I agree should have been included. Also, I Don't Need No Doctor, the Ray Charles cover that John Mayer did was one of the top 4 songs of the show and should have made the cut as well.Also, I hope they fixed the awful sound that was on the webcast. For example, Eric Clapton only played lead guitar for two of his songs, for the rest, Derek Trucks played lead. However, Eric Clapton's guitar was miked about 5 times louder than Trucks. Same with Buddy Guy's ""All Star"" set, with Buddy Guy and Clapton's guitars the only one's audible, even when it was Hubert Sumlin, Robert Cray, or John Mayer playing the solo."
2,Where's Robben,"Robben Ford is alledgely one of Eric's favorite guitar players, and clearly one of the best on the planet, but absent from this ""tour de force"". Shame."
1,Bad item,"The DVD that I recieved was ripped on the outside packaging, and the DVD case was broken. It was taped back together, but the case couldn't even open. I had to return it because I can't give something this poor of quality as a present."
4,Good mix,"Did not have any of the Alison Krauss performance on this, otherwise a good mix of what the day offered."
4,One Guitar DVD to Own,"Amazing performances from a variety of Guitar players, including but not limited to: Sonny Landreth, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Johnny Winter, Vince Gill and Willie Nelson...etc. I was also impressed with Jeff Becks young Bass Player. That girl can play.This DVD reminded me of all wonderful guitar players that we take for granted. Every one brought a different style to the show. If you enjoy guitar music this is one of the DVDs to add to your collection."
2,not a sgood a s synder others,i felt this book was not as good a s others written by synder. i felt that because the amin character in this book was so unappeling. she is so self centerd she is mean to the mom and she dosent realize that her moms suffering to. aslo i felt the book kin dof stopped aburtly at the ende whne it could have more story to go.
2,Not That Great of a Book,"I thought this book was not as good as Snyder's other book.I read the Headless Cupid and the Egypt game by her then got this thinking that it would be good by suffered a great disappoinment. I found that the main character in this book,Haley was rude and selfish. This just made me anoid. I mean she was so rude to everyone. She was such a brat. This book was also kind of confusing. I found myself in many parts of the book not quite fully knowing what was going on. I thought I could relate to her because she's about the same age as me and she's in the same grade as me, but boy was I wrong. So don't waist your money on this book I'm warning you."
1,Run for your lives!,"Please, profit from my mistake and DO NOT buy this product. We shouldn't all have to suffer. This MP3 player is, frankly, a piece of junk. Lots of skipping when it is moved at all, and know this: you WILL NOT get ""10 hours of play"" on the battery: the most I ever got from it was _2 hours_ on a brand new, brand name battery. Finally had to give up and buy another player, so this one was a complete waste of $."
1,It just.. died.,"This player was a gift from Christmas, the display was difficult, and the option menu was difficult and annoying to go through. I would go through batteries constantly. After the first few weeks, it started to get lags, and the start up was incredibly slow, the next problem was, it would just suddenly turn off, and drop information. The lags and stalls started growing longer, and longer, and eventually it stopped accepting any information from the USB, and died. All in all, it lasted about three or four months."
1,It doesn't work,"Dear Srs.It never happen, but there is a first one. The product I bought doesn't work."
3,Enjoyed it for awhile,"I enjoyed this book for about the first half, then I eventually got tired of it - I got repetitious to me."
5,A recipe for a fun read,"This book is like a warm, bubbling pot of stew simmering on the back burner. Its ingredients: unforgettable characters, familiar locations and down home stories of down home people make this a tantilizing read."
1,Weirdest Book I Ever Read,"Go to goodreads.com and read the review by Lisa. She reviewed this book perfectly and said the same things I would have. I really wanted to like this book, and did finish it to see if she ever got it together. She didn't. What a waste of my time!"
2,Dull,"Knife, made in China for DBK, was dull out of the box. The edge had multiple minute chips that took 20 minutes with a sharpening stone to take out."
3,Knives,This was not the same product I was expecting. My grandson had a set of Tramontina knives and the knives had the name on each of them. These knives do not have the name nor the emblem on the block. The knives simply say Stainless Steel. The block has nothing on it. I kind of feel I was misled by the ad.
3,Cheap,I agree with the other reviewer that these are rather cheap looking and hard to pinpoint the authenticity of the product... the blade is fine but the handle seems like it wont withstand any use...
4,helps Explain Official Maps,Good summaries of battles and movements. Excellent supplement to official maps. words words words words words words words words words
2,"Nice item, easy to assemble, poor customer service","I purchased table, nook, and bench. Put together bench and table with no problem; they are beautiful. Nook arrived with a piece broken; after multiple attempts to get part replaced (sent picture of piece & part number next day, with other attempts as well) still have partly assembled item taking up my kitchen. Not making me feel good about seller!"
3,Good start!,"This was a pretty good first novel. It got a little bogged down with TMI sometimes, lots of detail and then all of a sudden, lots of action. I had already figured out who ""done it"" midway through the book, probably because so many thrillers are so formulaic and you know it's someone you have `met' or who is close to the character or on the periphery so you just mentally start detecting them out. Interesting story of these all tied together but the culprit was just your basic ordinary psychopathic sadist. I will try #2 -- I rated this one 3.5 stars. The protag Anya is more interesting and more human than Kay Scarpetta or Tempe Brennan and I liked her a lot more. Like the Australian setting and her lifestyle."
3,Intriguing corpse similarities!!,"Well firstly I was momentarily confused by the words post-mortum and autopsy both being used until I realised that this was neither a British set or American set book...so it was refreshing to read something set in Australia. :)I liked Anya and found her work interesting, as well as her personal life. Although I never quite understood the relevance of having a sister who went missing as a child...it was just as good a story without that part.I enjoyed the plot and I wasn't expecting the ending...although I'm still not really sure about the motive. I also had to remind myself a couple of times who was who with so many female characters/corpses!I'd definitely look out for Kathyrn's second novel though. :)"
3,Misleading,This book is in the interracial catergory which it is why i bought it. It is not a interracial romance.I do believe that this was intentionally done. If you are buying it for the same reason don't.
3,Why is the Bundle so Expensive?,"I was about to order this set and did a little research. If you order all six DVDs separately you save over six dollars. What's with that? Don't you usually get a discount if you order complete sets?Now they offer the 1-7 set for about $30 less, what's going on with this product?"
1,Product Discontinued - Seller did not inform in a timely fashion.,The Wilmington Table and 4 Benches have been discontinued by the manufacturer. The supplier does not retain backorders and cancelled my order. It took me emailing the seller (Stacks and Stacks) to get an answer after the card had already been charged.
3,second thought,the table is extremely heavy and the benches have a tendency to chip at the bottom.it is very hard to move for cleaning . if you have it on hardwood floors like i do the benches will put grooves in the flooring. this table also is very big in size and takes up a lot of room. i would like to sell mine now just not that happy with it. i would like to say that the hydralicts on it work quite will.
3,Not much new here except that Montgomery has gone to the same trough as the Evangelicals,"A good paraphrase of Montgomery's previos modern day apologetic arguments - I agree with the Gangstalawya that there is not much new here - same old refutations of the usual heretics -.. what IS interesting, that makes this book stand apart from the previous body of Montgomery's work is Montgomery's extensive use of cites, quotes, and approvals from Jewish theological scholars - the other group of modern day heretics, but who have undermined the Christian body through Evangelicalism. So from this, one can only discern that Montgomery is drinking from the same well as the Evangelical heresay, or is trying to tap into that lucrative Evangelical book market - perhaps late on his Delorean payment.."
5,Cold Moon - an attempt at appropriate evaluation,vocabulary bliss -- delightfully sensual -- worth every penny
2,Vest Pocket Arabic (Vest Pocket Series),"Just a lot of dialogue. Not easy Arabic-learning. No index. But it does have word-for-word translation of sentences. Don't recommend it if you want to learn in an easy, simple matter. This is for intense sit-down reading. All concentration reading, like studying."
5,A Review for The Botany Coloring Book by Paul Young,This is a great book when paired with Horticulture Principles and Practices by George Acquaah. By coloring in the pictures and processes illustrated here I find it very easy to return to the text book and to understand what had previously been very complex vocabulary when I read the text the first time.The coloring book helps everything come alive and be understandable. This would make a great summertime exercise for junior high or senior high students or to keep any adult actively learning.It took a little doing to learn the system they use but once I caught on it is relatively simple. I highly recommend this book. I have never used this type of learning tool before and find it keeps me focused on the topic at hand.
5,Botany Teacher,I ordered this book to provide reinforcement for my Botany class's Histology Unit. I already own the Biology and Zoology editions. These science coloring books are an excellent tool to add to your classroom. I would also recomend them to any post secondary student who is studying Botany.
3,For beginners,I bought this I was an undergrad student when I was taking plant biology/science classes. I guess I was expecting more discussion of different types of plants but it was very general. I was also expecting there to be more coloring of plants/structures.This is a very good general introduction. It has a lot of written information as well. Recommend for those just learning about plants.
2,did not work for me,"I have used the product for nearly 1 month, and honestly I think my circles are becoming darker. I don't really have bags, just the dark circles, and after almost a month of everyday use I can't tell any difference, and do think perhaps my circles are darkening! Yikes, certainly not what I was expecting when I bought the product."
3,"Good set, but will wear out.","I bought this set from Amazon about 1 year ago at a great price. They been used a couple times a week since then and have held up great for the most part. There was some discoloration when I made some sugar cookies one day, and you can still see the outline on the pans. It hasn't affected their non-stick coating though!I have noticed that any baked on foods are very difficult to remove. You end up scratching the non-stick coating, so be sure to soak them as soon as you're done using them."
2,Wilton Cookie sheets,"I ordered these cookie sheets based on the Wilton name, and expected a quality product. I am using these pans in my Microwave convection oven for baking, and every time I use one, no matter the temperature, the pan buckles, and it does not produce evenly browned items. Everything slides all over the pan. I'm not a happy camper."
1,Warped after 2nd use,"Bought this set of 3 cookie sheets last week for a potluck gathering this past weekend. The price was right and I figured, even if they just last a few years, I'll just buy another set then. So we baked 2 batches of cookies and then put 2 pumpkin pies on one of them to catch anything that might spill over. When we checked in during baking, the pies were lopsided because the sheet had become warped. The oven was always around 350-400 degrees. I can't believe these didn't even last me 1 week!! What a waste of $. Will be going back to the store for a different brand. Note: these do come with a 5 year warranty. I may attempt to call, but am not expecting anything. Will update if Wilton CS comes through, although, what's the point of having another set of sheets that will warp again?"
1,screen protector,Do not buy if you are intending on being able to still use the touch srcreen on your treo its a waste of money in shipping
3,"Wonderful series, terrible edition","The Dragonriders of Pern is a wonderful Sci-Fi/Fantasy series that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys dragons, space/time travel and an intricate tale. I give the story itself 5 stars.This particular edition, however, is quite cringe worthy. Spelling errors and name changes abound, which unfortunately ruins the mood and jars one out of the story. I'd give the omnibus 2 stars, it's not a complete waste of time, but it's pretty close.I'm very disappointed with this omnibus. If I had realized there were so many errors I would have returned it when I bought it and bought the individual volumes instead."
5,Three of the best in one!,"Anne McCaffrey is one of my favorite authors. I have not yet read everything she has ever written, but I'm almost there. The novels about the dragons and dragonriders of Pern are masterpieces of science fiction writing. This book combines three sequential novels that make it easy to get into the stories of F'lar and Lessa and the passage of the Red Star dumping thread on an unbelieving Pern after the 400 year Long Interaval and continues to the rediscovery of the rich heritage that their ancestors have left for them with the unearthing of Landing. I highly suggest this book for anyone who does not have any of the three and would like to start a collection of some of the best science fiction books on earth. Other McCaffrey books are equally good, especially the brainship series, the crystal singer series, and the many other dragonrider of Pern books."
4,One of my favorites,"This series is one of my favs. The story is original and the characters and action make for pleasant reading. An excellent read, especially for little girls."
3,"rather dry, to be honest.","Though some people seem to feel that a series being a ""classic"" makes it somehow inherently better, I feel that there's a lot of material better than the Pern series on the market today. This is a prime example of a series that really shouldn't have been--though the first book, Dragonflight, is an entertaining and worthy read, the sequels are progressively less original, sliding into bland, anticlimactic works that read more like history textbooks than novels. Buy Dragonflight by itself, read that, and skip the rest."
2,Disappointed,"I finally read this book a few months ago, after hearing for years how good it was, and was quite dissapointed. I found the characters to be surprisingly shallow, and the quality of the writing was not up to par. It seems to me as if the plot was developed chapter by chapter. I know there are plenty out there who love this book, but I am not one."
3,"Not bad, but not brilliant","I bought The Dragonriders of Pern (comprising the first three novels in the series) about 17 years ago from a book club. Back then I barely made it through the first story ""Dragonflight"", and I put the book aside. Then about 2 years ago, I thought I would read it finally. I finished ""Dragonflight"" and thought it was ok. I started on ""Dragonquest"", and I plodded through it. I don't know what it was, because usually I love science-fiction and fantasy, and have read a lot. I have still to read ""The White Dragon"", and I may read it sometime, maybe the more books you read in a series, the more they grow on you. But I really didn't think the first two novels were anything exceptional."
4,Could've Been Slightly Better,"Well, I was slightly disappointed. The writing was great, but typoes such as T'ton in DF instead of T'ron."
5,I love Pern,"I love the entire Pern series of novels, and hope Anne McCaffrey's son, who co-wrote a few of the Pern stories, will continue the series."
5,Awesome fantasy novels that are really science fiction,"But it doesn't really matter what genre they are, they are page turning wonders. Newcomers to Ms. McCaffrey's world should probably be warned that they need to read the the Harper Hall trilogy after Dragon Quest and before The White Dragon. It probably works without them, but I do so love the trilogy and it definitely adds to The White Dragon to have read them first. Unfortunately they are published by a different company and for some reason don't seem to be on Kindle except as Audiobooks."
3,It was OK,"Yeah, the books were great. The plot ran smoothly and it had just the right amount of everything for me, but I have one problem with it. In not just my edition of this book, but in some others I saw too, there were millions of spelling errors. I aslo was missing pages 757 to 788 in my book wich made me really upset. I hope this helps you."
5,Great story!,"I decided to read this book after my husband told me about it for the umpteenth time. I'm on the second of the three books now and I'm loving it. I told him it would make a great movie and he looked on the internet and discovered a screenwriter has been hired to write the screenplay in preparation for a movie.... very exciting! Love the story line... try it, you'll like it!"
4,very solid,these books are the foundation of a series that becomes more and more amazing with each installment. on of the best blends of fantasy and science fiction if have read to date
4,great for teens,"i read (most of) this when i was 13. i loved it. i still think that it was perfect time for reading this series. so if you've maxed out on hunger games and game of thrones, you might want to take a peek.i shouldnt have reread it 30+ years later. same feeling that i had with the foundation series: i have become too critical of style and literary technique for these 2 authors."
1,Uninteristing Series,"I hope not to offend those who wrote rave reviews, but I have a theory on this. The only people who submit their reviews are those who are going to give the book a high score, because they are interested in the book. I, personally, found the books I read in this series (and that was around five)to be boring and tedious, harping on the same theme over and over again. I was prepetually waiting for the action (constantly referred to) to begin. Sure, there was ""implied"" action, but nothing that gave me a sense of actually living in the book. Thank you for reading this review."
4,Great series!,"My introduction to Anne McCaffrey was the second book of this trilogy and I absolutely loved it. I read the third book, The White Dragon, and it became one of my favorite books ever. Then I read the first book of the trilogy and I couldn't finish it because I found it to be a very boring read. Since then I have read the trilogy through a couple times and have come to appreciate the first book more and more but still find it to be the least interesting of the three. The second and third book more than make up for the first and if I were just rating them I would have given this trilogy 5 stars.My advice is read this trilogy and if you are having trouble getting through the first book skip it! The second one does not rely on a thorough understanding of the first."
3,"Good, fun reading","I have read every Anne McCaffrey book on the Dragonriders of Pern series.The premise is simple, clean fun that anyone from 12 to 102 can wile away a few hours. The stories are written that one can follow and are not caught up in the hard-core science fiction genre of technological gadgets, gore and mind-bending horror.The series can be rather repitious(sorry if I misspelled that) at times but Anne keeps the reader interested.Also, I liked her ""Killashandra"" series. Whatever you think of this review believe me, I have read the Pern books several times over and haven't tired of them.I also hope Anne McCaffrey goes beyond the end of Avias to another level."
5,My very favorite Sci Fi books,"These books are wonderful. I read them several years ago and couldn't put them down. If you love Science Fiction or Fantasy, and I didn't know I did until I read these, I highly recommend them. They should appeal to both men and women but are told from a woman's perspective as many of Anne McCaffrey's books are. Some excitement, some science, some romance there is something for everyone!"
1,Good stories bad edition,"The actual story of Pern, it's people, dragons & trials is very well written and enthralling. I know because I was drawn in despite the poor quality of the kindle edition. Words are clearly missing, important words like and, the, also, things you need to build a sentence that makes sense. Sentences will abruptly stop, paragraphs will abruptly begin. Quotation marks are often missing from dialog, for a period of time I thought that maybe some of the characters were mind readers because they would respond to the other character's thoughts, but no, it's just the formatting. The story itself is good enough to make you work for it, but I doubt the author's intention was for me to play ""what's the missing word"" or ""Is this supposed to be spoken dialog"".TL;DR Buy the Pern books, do not buy this edition."
2,Not Impressed,"I read this book on the recommendation of my sister and I was very disappointed in the content. The plot was at times good, but not often, and I found the book about the white dragon Ruth to be pointless all together. In my opinion this is by far the worst dragon fantasy type books that I have read to date. For a real fantasy book that is worth the money and the time look up Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince, or use the URL below.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0886774500/qid=1122129202/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-9347105-1985644?v=glance&s;=books&n;=507846"
5,ONE OF THE BEST FANTASY NOVELS IN EXISTENCE,"This is one of the best fantasy books I've ever read, and one of the best trilogies. McCaffrey created an entire culture and put it on paper. It is best to read the books in order, starting with Dragonflight and finishing with the White Dragon. It might not make as much sense and you may not like it as much unless you start at the beginning."
5,Very cool,"I bought this book a month ago and am just finishing Dragonquest now. I still haven't read the last one, but the first two are great. I had a very hard time putting it down long enough to go to class. There's a good bit of action, but it's sort of like the action in Ender's Game by OS Card. It's not people running around from place to place, it's more like people figuring things out and than acting on that. Overall, not bad. A word of warning though: don't start this if you have lots of other stuff to read for school or work to do, it's very distracting and takes a long time to read all of."
2,has design flaws,"Unfortunately, this cat door has two design flaws. One is that if installed according to the directions and the design, the tabs that lock the door directionally and/or completely, appear to be backward. Those tabs are quite small as a result. We installed the inner part of the door backwards, and made a frame for it so that the larger locking tabs were usable. The other flaw is that the spring on the door is quite strong and requires a fairly hard push to move it open. Then the strong spring causes the door to hit the cat's tail as it closes. All in all, a disappointing purchase. I feel that I wasted the money. In order for the cats to use it, I have to prop the door open with a piece of wood."
5,Great product!,This is a well made cat door. I really like that I can lock in either direction to either keep the cats out or keep them in.
5,easy to use,This is not just good for large cat but for cats going around in a more comfortable manner. Highly recommend!
3,"Mostly okay, but not without some problems","I was able to cut the liner in this cat flap and used it in the aluminum kick plate on my screen door. It installed fine and worked okay at first. Two problems with the unit though. First, the locks are easy to bump with your foot or for your cat to bump going through the door, resulting in a locked door that you don't know about... My poor cat was stuck inside for a day before I figured it out! The second problem is that the magnet in the door came loose and fell out after about 6 months. The door still works but it doesn't shut properly.Okay piece, but for the price I expected higher quality. Not impressed."
1,Nonsense,"This is by far the silliest Jack the Ripper book I have ever read (then again, I haven't read Richard Wallace's _Light-Hearted Friend_).Dr. Abrahamsen purports to psychoanalyze the Ripper based on his crimes, and decides that the Ripper is really two men: HRH Prince Albert Victor Christian Edward and his tutor, James Kenneth Stephen.His evidence? None. Really. Not even a little bit. This is hardly surprising, since research has shown that Prince Albert Victor _could not_ have committed the crimes; his movements are accounted for on every one of the murder nights.With this piece of nonsense, Dr. Abrahamsen forfeits his right to be taken seriously, either as a psychiatrist or as an author"
1,Don't Waste Your Time on This One,"If it were possible for a book to earn zero stars that's what the rating on this book would be. As the other reviewers have stated, the author doesn't prove his theory, and the idea that Prince Eddy has been pretty much shown to be false by other researchers.The one thing he adds to the mix is his argument that the Ripper probably had a lookout simply because he seemed to be able to concentrate on his slaughter without concern that someone would stumble upon him. That's the one supposition in the entire book that at least carries some weight because it's logical. Otherwise, the book is pretty much a waste of time.For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on the Squidoo website."
1,Awful,A third of the contents of the container were rock hard slivers that were inedible. It was overwhelmingly green pepper. Absolutely awful. Threw it out.
2,Needs a salt-free version,"This spice blend is delicious. Hubby won't eat canned spaghetti sauce unless I dump some of this in it. We've gone through at least three or four jars. Unfortunately, the salt in this blend is just doesn't work. It's not that we're low-sodium fans, but canned sauces simply do not need added salt. More importantly, no matter how I try to keep the distribution even (shake, stir, etc.), the bottom quarter of the container ends up having so much salt in it that it's simply unusable. Instead of throwing away any more, I'm working on coming up with my own mix of seasonings to pep up our sauce. I won't be buying any more."
5,Spicy Spaghetti Seasoning,"Not many stores stocks this exceptional seasoning. I use it not only in spaghetti, but goulash and stews. It really brings a great Italian flavor up and makes an average dish, exceptional."
5,Ghostface Drops Another ill One,"I dropped out of Hip Hop for a few years, came back due to Alchemist-1st Infantry and its been really rare i jock an album. Ghostface Fishcale was definitely one of them (best rap album of 2006). Now with this follow up ""More Fish"" picks up and accomplishes to quench my thirst, actually appetite for more Ghostface. This album doesnt disappoint one bit. I liked it so much, i went out and bought it today even after i already had a burned copy from a friend. Credit where credit is due. Thanks Ghost."
4,MORE FISH,"ANOTHER GOOD ONE FOR GHOST. SOME SONGS YOU DON'T WANT TO HERE THE SECOND TIME YOU HERE THE CD. THE GOOD THING ABOUT GHOST'S STYLE IS THAT HE CAN RAP OVER ANY MUSIC. THE FIRST SONG IS BY ERIC B AND RAKIM FROM THE MOVIE JUICE WITH TUPAC AND OMAR EPS. I LIKE THE 3RD SONG THAT INCLUDE CAPPA AND KILLAH SIN, THEY BOTH RIP IT UP. OVERALL ITS A GOOD ONE TO HAVE I KEEP THIS ONE ON MY CD ROTATION. THERES MORE TO SAY BUT THOSE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME OFF THE BAT."
4,just made it to 4 stars !!!,"this cd is banging for the most part the only thing i dislike for the most part are some of the beats. this cd just barely makes your 15 dollars worth. its a descent effort. it's better than fishscale i'll tell you that much, if your a ghost fan pick this one up."
5,"The director succeeds at his aim, despite what the critics have said!","The director's first film was an academy award winning, deep tense emotionally fraught political drama. Maybe critics were upset when the director changed tacks this time around and decided to make a more accessible entertainment, in the Hitchcockian vein. Regardless of the bad reviews critics gave this movie, I think the director succeeds admirably at his objective. I was entertained throughout, Depp and Jolie are solid, and the cinematography is spellbinding."
3,Decent Homage to '50s/'60s,"This movie reminded of old films, '50s and '60s-type spy films in which there is little action but the characters are interesting enough to make you pay attention and see if you can guess who's who and what's what. Kind or like the 1963 hit ""Charade,"" expect this movie is much more low key. Cary Grant would have been ideal in Johnny Depp's role.Despite mostly dialog-driven, Angelina Jolie and Depp have star-power faces that will have you involved as does the great European scenery and photography, which is first rate on a Blu-Ray.All in all: a pretty good subtle film and worth at least a rental."
1,waste of fim and time.,This was a horrible movie. Anyone could have pulled off Angelinas role. Just pile on 10 lbs. of mascara and desinger dresses-there you have it. She just walked around like a peacock and had people admiring her as she passed by- I almost puked.Johnny Depp must have taken this movie on a dare because he wasn't any better. This whole movie was a waste of film. If you are into watching Angelina walk around and not do anything (no lie) I mean nothing this movie is for you.This was definitly a look at me ego movie.
3,Slow,Movie was slow and did not make use of the talents that both Jolie and Depp possess! But its tolerable if you really like these two actors.....
3,Entertaining movie,"This is not such a bad movie if you have pretty low expectations. It isentertaining, funny at times, and suspenseful. Maybe the problem was withthe script, or the plot, or the chemistry between the lead characters, I don'tknow. Maybe I was expecting more action and special effects.If you have nothing better to do, why not watch this movie?"
4,I enjoyed it,"It has subtle European sensibilities so your so your mainstream crowd isn't going to like this at all. Which is why people don't say they didn't like it and move on but actually get angry. Just look at all the one star posts. It's definitely enjoyable if you like the old Bond movies or movies like North by Northwest. Those are definitely the genre. Great dialogue, fun plot, good acting. Espionage with comedic undertones."
2,"Slow moving, predictable, lacking","I expected this movie to have some thrills in it or intrigue, but it fell flat with a slow moving and predictable plot and lackluster performances by both Depp and Jolie. Don't bother with this one."
1,Awful,Terrible movie and terrible acting. Jolie sucks. Dont buy this movie save your money it is boring and has TERRIBLE acting!
1,"Oh, so bad","This is one for the golden turkey book. The story is preposterous, the acting is tv-like, the action is minimal and wholly unbelievable, and the female star should have been hospitalized and force fed before appearing in a film about Plastic Woman. What an utter waste of time."
2,Money Pit,"I'll know to completely disregard Golden Globe nominations from here on out. What was I thinking? Depp is only good when playing a freak of some sort and all I can do when Jolie is on the screen is stare at her mutant lips which take up 55% of the view.Terrible script and direction and all the rest. No imagination wasted on this creation. ""Let's hire big draws, excrete some stupid screenplay, and make a lot of dough off the Sheeple""."
1,Awful!,"This movie started out slow and stayed slow. It was so boring! I will say that it had a good, interesting ending, but we had to wait almost two hours to get to it! Don't waste your money!"
1,Worst of the worst,"The Tourist is an awful movie. It is worse than my previous worst, The Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce Brosnan. If you watch The Tourist after reading this review please do not come back to it to tell me I was right. Shame on you for watching what you were warned not to. It was, by far the biggest waste of time in my movie viewing history, please don't let that happen to you."
4,A little worried right off the bat...,"I got this because I'm a huuuuge Depp fan. However, I don't like Jolie anymore(she's gotten preppy since getting with Brad Pitt). I had to skim through mine because I had a used copy with Spanish art inside so I needed to make sure that it worked and was in English. It was and I'm sure I'll enjoy it...despite the bad reviews I keep seeing. I've only ever seen one movie of Johnny's that I just didn't like at all so I'm not worried."
1,boring horror,"Jolie looks like a waxwork surgical figure suffering from acromeglia, the film moves with the urgency and excitement of a tugboat."
1,"Slow, boring, and predictable","The first 40 minutes were actionless, boring, and mostly unimportant to the plot. Maybe 5 or 10 minutes of the first 40 were necessary. There was no suspense and little action threw out the rest of the movie. And the action scenes were things like a stunning 10 mph boat chase and a lot of bad guys who can't hit close targets with automatic weapons.Of the two plot twist one of them you suspect from the very beginning and both render the rest of the plot invalid. Johnny and Angelina were average at best, nothing spectacular or honestly even on par with their abilities. I have no doubt that their names are the only thing that kept this film from going straight to dvd."
2,Ridiculous Plot and slow moving,"The plot is absolutely ridiculous and there are long stretches that move at a snails crawl. On the Plus side the film is beautifully shot and the location in Venice is a treat to watch.Is this supposed to be a Comedy? Not so, other reviewers compare it to Hitchcock flicks but, if so, this is a lame attempt at the genre."
3,ehh,I watched the theatrical release and thought it was really good...so I bought the director's cut because they are usually better. Not in this case! I watched this with a friend and we both noticed that multiple scenes looked like they were completely unedited and you could tell that they were shot on a set without even trying to look for errors. Disappointing. :(
3,"May I have the envelope, please.","The Oscar for ""Best Movie Shot in Venice"" goes to...THE TOURIST. The beautiful city of Venice, Italy was the best thing about this movie. The rest was...well...not really anything International Bad Guy vs Interpol different or edge-of-the-seat-whodunit startling. It was an OK 113 minute long piece of escapism. While the movie was entertaining, I didn't really care about the characters. Angelina Jolie standing there looking glamorous does nothing for me, and Johnny Depp, a gifted actor with long, unwashed hair, was wasted here. The real star was Venice. There were many beautiful views of this ""Floating City"" to marvel at. For that alone I rate it 3 and 1/2 stars."
3,Just alright,"Johnny Depp is one of th greatest actors of all times, the absolute bestYet, this movie failed to capture my attention span, not at all engrossingThe charcters are so so, dont pull you in at allMs. Jolie is beautiful, stunning in face, the locales are gorgeous venice picturesque, and it is a well made moviebut so artificial, you never forget that it is only a movieOne of the things about a movie is that it makes you forget and you become a part of the story,The tourist does not do it, just another commercial flik"
2,A Silly Movie,This is a silly movie that could not decide what it wanted to be. Is it an Art Film? Is it a mystery? Is it a love story? What a waste of actors! The plot was dumb.
2,Yawn,"1.5 stars. An unorignal plot with a cliche and predictable story-line. Even the mandatory ""twist"" at the end falls flat; it's contrived and you can see it coming a mile away. This is a lame rehash other other similar (and much better) films.Not recommended."
2,The Tourist - Nothing to revisit.,"I like both these actors and see every movie they are in, but this just was not a good movie. Depp seemed to be phoning it in, I did enjoy Jolie. I was expecting much more from this movie, there was absolutely no chemistry between these two actors on the screen."
2,A great movie to take a nap to.,"With such a great cast, I was expecting a very exciting movie. The whole movie was seen by the preview shown on TV. It had one little plot twist at the end that just was not enough to make the movie worth watching."
2,could not finish movie,A rental ...not very good. No chemistry between the two lead actors. Maybe I was not in the mood but I really could not get into it.
2,The Tourist,"I saw the previews and was hoping for a romantic caper of the style of Charade or To Catch a Thief, but was seriously disappointed. It was boring and Angelina can't act her way out of a paper bag. Johnny Depp is not a suave hero type at all. Everyone in the audience was saying the same things as they came out..should watchd it on netflix and saved the money. Don't waste your's unless you go in not expecting much so you aren't disppointed. The scenery and Angelina's clothes are the best things about it."
1,This is painful,"Depp and Jolie cannot do comedy, you will not walk away from this movie saying it was good,just wait and watch it on tv, so you have the option of turning the channel, nothing happens andsomehow they fall in love, painful to watch"
1,The Cure For Insomnia,"Angelina, alarmingly anorexic, hasn't changed her actioner character since she was Mrs. Smith. Didn't even bother to phone this one in. She just showed up. Movie was droning on at a decent speed until Johnny Dipstick came into the first scene, then ground to a screeching halt where it remained mired in mud to the end...I guess. I couldn't get past the first half hour. Johnny is lost with only his naked face, which was alarmingly puffy and aged. Without the ridiculous Tim Burton makeup and silly hats and pirates, there's no one there. No chemistry whatsoever between he and she.Run! Run for your life from this one!"
1,so very very bad,"The actors phoned this one in for a paycheck. They are as bored performing in it as the audience is watching it. This is a truly awful movie. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck must have been bored directing it as well since his movie, 'The Lives of Others', is so excellent. That is the movie to watch, not this wretched thing."
2,Venice and Jolie's lips under knife,The beautiful city of Venice and the plump lips of Jolie under the knife of the bad guy were the only good things in this movie. I just could not believe that these two amazing stars made such an unimportant movie. Such shallow dialogue and such unrealistic characters. Especially the main bad guy. The choking scene was just unbelievable. Literally. I can not help but think that this movie was only good for adding another 20 or so million dollars to Depp's and Jolie's bank accounts.
3,Disappointing.,"The pace was glacial, on purpose, I know, and the action minimal. It didn't make it as a cerebral thriller, action thriller or love story. It just menadered all around them. Jolie looked lovley and Depp seemed flat. I was bummed. I enjoyed their cover on Entertainment Weekly more."
5,The Terrific Tourist,How can you possibly go wrong with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp!!! This was a fantastic movie. I loved everything about it!
3,Average Movie,"I think this movie was average, especially considering the big name actors. The plot was ok and the twist at the end was not really well planned out. I think usually when a movie has a major plot twist you can go back and find the clues hidden through the movie. In this movie I believe there was really no hints or evidence to show that the twist was happening. I also think that Depps character role was weak for the quality of actor that he is."
3,Not bad!,"There's a bit of a twist at the end which for me, made the movie better! I thought it was a great date night movie!"
3,"""The Tourist"" is an accessible, if not rich, travel diversion.","The stars of this movie are Angelina Jolie's poise and stature and her big smokey-brown eyes and the beautiful Venice locale. Johnny Depp is no Carey Grant and underplays his role as the titular tourist; this movie doesn't do anything to add to his stardom (and it certainly wouldn't be thrusting him toward stardom if he weren't already a movie star). Angelina gets the far better role here. There are a couple of twists of course (one in the middle that I didn't see coming and the one at the end that was pretty easy to see ahead of time--but I won't ruin either of them here). For me the most interesting character was Paul Bettany's Inspector who was WASPish in his desire to capture the film's ""villain"" and whose tone-on frustration in being repeatedly thwarted or overruled at every turn was a delight to watch."
4,Nice Twist at the End,"Angelina is simply stunning, and Johnny is well, what can I say.....he's gorgeous. The movie was good, light-hearted, and a nice change of pace from other movies out there. The French and Italian scenery is so beautiful that it makes me want to visit Europe. The movie has a nice flow and is a bit unpredictable (for a change) with a nice twist at the end. It's worth the money."
4,Fun to watch and beautiful to see!,"The story is clever and the script is as good as any Baldacci or Cussler novel.All of the actors were fun to watch in their roles--the kind of movie that gets better and better the more times you see it. And the Director's Commentary is almost as good as the main show!It's a stretch to think that the Scotland Yard can do its recovery and analysis of the burned document in only a few minutes' time and then quickly dispatch Parisian agents on-site to the intended subway station, but sure, it's good entertainment.The sweeping aerial views of Venice are so beautiful that you can stop-action-them on your wall-mount tv and it's like having a masterpiece painting in the room! The beauty of the costuming and party scenes and fine dining scenes are like the director is giving us an artistic gift beyond the yarn of the piece."
5,Keep U guessing!,"I thought it was a wonderful movie. I loved all the glamour, today's movies lack that now. Anyway I loved the way it ended, even the gag reel was funny!"
2,CD Froze in the middle of Movie,"I was in the middle of the Movie when the CD Froze, i had to stop and restart the movie. Once i restarted the movie to find out that it froze again at the end of the MOVIE..... Not HAPPY"
1,Yawn...,"The good: beautiful locales in Paris and Venice.The bad: boring, botoxed Jolie and bland, bumbling, Depp bring nothing to the film or each other.The ugly: the supposedly big plot twist is so transparent, it had me at hello. The film editing is awful with very obvious places where actors are just holding for the camera in hopes they can cut and paste in some interest later.Any resemblance to the clever and sparkling caper films (Charade, To Catch a Thief) is non-existent.Personally, I must admit to avoidance of anything with Ms. Jolie, however, Johnny Depp is usually interesting. Not so here."
1,Take two actors...,"Take two actors that are well known. Bring them to Venice. Tell them to dress up and walk around. The Female actor has one mission; to look good. The Male actor is a side-kick that is supposed to talk in almost a whisper. Forbid any storyline or manuscript. Tape 90 minutes and use a lot of promotion. What do you get? The Tourist!What I do not understand is how these actors agree to do this? Is it the easy money? Well, if you want to look at the face of Angelina Jolie with a few kilo of make-up on and if you really think Venice looks like in the movie this is a film for you. Those of us who have been there more than once and struggled through the city with the real tourists have a hard time buying this."
2,Strange and hard to connect with,"Wow, slow and disappointing. Lots of eye-candy but that doesn't justify a movie---we want a good story. This comes off as just odd, strange juxtaposition of quiet moments and harried action, soundtrack is meant to be James Bond-like but comes off as a plastic fake. Jolie is starting to look ghoulish instead of elegant, too thin, too bony, too much makeup and long, boring hair. Bedecked in couture, she's almost got the silhouette of a 60 year old Park Avenue widow who eats two bites once a day. Depp looks puffy and old. I long for the days when making a thriller like this seemed easier to achieve, because the backbone of the story was solid. This movie is full of twisting plot turns and can be confusing---all distractions that are meant to hide missing plot holes because the story is so weak. Could have been great if it were done right the first time."
2,Angelina Jolie ruined the movie,"The only thing that saved this movie was Johnny Depp. Angelina was like a piece of cardboard-stiff and boring. Same expression on her face LITERALLY the entire movie, her fake eyelashes were so dark and heavy she almost looked drugged. She contributed a big fat ZERO to this movie. The story line was intriguing (though a stretch at being believable) but Johnny Depp was humble, sweet and funny. He played the role perfectly. But Jolie ruined the film with her 'pursed lip' emotionless acting. I used to like her, but will not go in a theatre to see her in a movie again. She has lost her edge and desire to put out a good performance. She gives the impression it is just enough to have her in the movie...she doesn't need to act (ie..DIVA). Please producers, stop putting her in movies...save yourself a few mill...she's not worth it!!!! ANY ACTRESS would have done a much better job....and it could have been a five star movie."
1,they exceeded plan 9 from outer space.,"Believe me, this is the worst movie of all time.They should be ashamed not only for making this movie, also for stealing from Ed Wood the only prize that he had.This movie should have no star at all."
1,No real service.,"Ordered this movie on April 13th and it is now April 20th, still no movie. Amazon is slipping. I am also a Prime member will have a hard time renewing my Prime membership, or ordering from Amazon again."
3,Good acting but,There is good acting but the sensual expressions on there faces got on my nerves. There is not much action in the movie .
3,Better without expectations!,"Having gone initially to the theatre to see THE TOURIST primarily to view the chemistry and performances of Depp and Jolie, we had found the movie predictable and drag-y. Catching it at home on a second viewing, we discovered its fun, found the chemistry we had been too impatient to concentrate upon and discovered we had a really good time with the film. We still found the tour of Venice a bit 1960-I SPY-ish, and the direction uneven. However the stars did shine more brightly than on first viewing and the surrounding players made it an enjoyable evening. Sometimes we need to see a film a second time to discover its virtues for the first time. .Blue Ray in the home, a really good pizza and a nice Chianti: Now that's a good investment!"
1,No Chemistry,"Absolutely no chemistry between the leads, almost painful to watch them together. Horrible movie and the surprise twist was easy to figure out within the first few minutes."
4,Gorgeous,"Angelina Jolie is absolutely gorgeous in this movie. Johnny Depp is funny and corky. The art direction is beautiful. I didn't care too much for the plot, but it's still a good movie for me"
4,Really liked this movie,"Who doesn't love Johnny Depp? He is so cool in this movie. About half way through the film I figured out what the end of the movie would be, but it was the ending that I wanted, so I was okay with it. Angeline Jolie plays a Brit in the movie, and in all honesty, she did okay, but not fabulous with the language - she pulled it off, but I liked her as an actress, so I went with it. All in all, it was a great story line and I enjoyed the movie. I plan to watch it again this week. If I had any say-so, I would have added an extra bit of filmage to show how Johnny Depp's character ended up where he was on vacation - what he went through before getting there - but I would have added that at the very end of the film. Oh well, I'm not a director or writer, so there you have it."
1,"Imperfect. Ghastly, actually.","I watch a lot of film. A whole lot. Having booked for theaters and having operated an independent house, I've pretty much seen it all.This film's writer and director demanded nothing more than posturing from the leads. Jolie models ... archly and very poorly. Depp sleepwalks from A to Zzz.There was a kernel of an idea here for a quite possibly intriguing movie; but what you'll see is a lazy waste of your time.""Still, fans of ""The Tourist"" and ""Sex And The City 2"" give thumbs up. Look forward to more of the same."
1,dismal-SO dismal,"I refused to watch this when it was at the theatres only because I have the uncanny ability to know when a movie is a dud or not just by watching the trailers. I decided to watch it last night and I was NOT disappointed. I was right again! This movie is so lacking in the WoW department. Depp has no depth, Jolie is plastic. The only thumbs up I give is to Bettany, Dalton and Sewell. This movie did absolutely nothing for either Depp or Jolie. They both must have been bored and needed a project to work on OR someone must have thrown a LOT of money their way to film such tripe. The writing was ridiculous and SHAME on the shills who post 5 star ratings for this movie. All they are doing is stealing from ""the people"" by making us believe (well some of us) that this movie is worth spending your money on. SHAME SHAME SHAME."
1,Bad Disks,"Beware------------- I got two of these from WalMart- both would not work, so I got one from Amazon and it also will not work. I have tried them on 2 diferent Sony bluray players and my computer regular player to no avail. These appear to be a nation wide lot of bad disks as I got the WalMart ones in Alaska. This is a Sony movie and for it not to run on Sony players is crazy...Beware"
2,"Boring...,",Had high hopes for this review as we love Johnny Depp. Such as disappointment. Characters were not developed. We almost gave up after 30 min and should have. Don't waste your time or money...
4,It was such a fun movie,My husband and I just watched the movie and really enjoyed. It is an entertaining film. Watch with open mind.
4,A very good thriller.,"In this film you don't need to sit at the edge of the chair, but at the end you are totally surprised"
3,"Cute enough movie, beautiful scenery","I'll admit I watched this in part because of the gorgeous European scenery. I wasn't disappointed. The movie goes from Paris to Italy and the scenes are so beautiful. I was entertained throughout the flick and when it finished my family agreed that it was a ""cute enough film"" meaning that it had: action, romance, a decent story, and really good acting. I'm not usually a Johnny Depp fan but I did like him in this. My family enjoyed this, and I think you will as well."
4,Glamourous Romantic Adventure,"Fun, entertaining and worth the ticket price. A good storyline, witty remarks from Depp, and a beautiful setting. Reminds me of a classic black and white with modern updates, in both content and pace. I enjoyed it very much."
3,Predictable,"I enjoyed the movie but it was very predictable. I kept hoping that I hadn't pegged it from the very beginning... but, I had. Good acting, good story and I still enjoyed it."
3,Missing Passion,"Remake of a great movie; Johnny Depp and Angie are both talented actors, but unfortunately the necessary chemistry between the two just wasn't there."
5,Very simply good,"Very simply, this is just a really good movie - relax, settle back, and watch subtle excellence at work. Enjoy."
4,"Good old fashioned type movie, but...","I enjoyed this movie, even though critics say there was poor chemistry between Depp and AJ. It was passable, but I think part of the problem was both Depp's character ... and that hair! AJ was absolutely beautiful and had they polished him up a bit, it may have worked better. Just a few tweeks would have made this a great movie, but all that aside, it was still a enjoyable one to watch."
4,The Tourist DVD,This is an excellent action/adventure movie and I was very happy to see two ofmy favorite actors on the same movie. Johnny Depp delivers a great job of a confusedand out of place tourist. Angelina Jolie as an unknown agent is wonderful.As usual I found that the DVD version was more than I had hoped for.
3,Predictable...,"...to the point where I could have written the storyline.Everything about this movie was predictable and cliched, almost from the beginning to the end. I just watched this for the first time 2 days ago and afterward I asked myself, ""Really?"". Was that all? Maybe it's a harsh judgment, but that is what I thought about the Tourist. It's a one hit wonder, meaning I won't be watching it again.It's almost as forgettable as Salt, and that's saying something.So why give it 3 stars?Well, 2 stars on this site would mean that I ""didn't like"" the movie. It's not that I didn't like the movie; it's just that I wish I didn't catch on to it as quick as nails. The other guy who might have been Pearce never even crossed my mind as a consideration for BEING Pearce. Not even a fleeting thought of, ""Could that be him? Nah. Bleh."".3 stars means the director made a good try of it...and failed.At least for me he did."
2,My brain still hurts,"Stupid, stupid stupid movie. My brain still hurts from watching it. Gave it 2 stars b/c Jolie is hot."
2,The Tourist,"Fairly entertaining movie with its constant twists and nice visuals, however the plot is filled with holes and the characters are poor. All the heroine's character seems to do is try to smolder and be one dimensional, and Johnny Depp simply does not look good here (I don't know why they let him look like this in the movie). There is also little to no chemistry between the two leads. However this movie does have a feel reminiscent of oldie movies like ""North by Northwest"", and the visuals of Venice are beautiful.Overall a fairly entertaining movie, if you don't think about the plot."
2,"Minimal action, no thrills","This is one of those movies where the preview is far better than the movie. In fact, to make the preview, they edited the clips to make the action faster and the conversations funnier. The movie trailer is thus nothing like the actual movie.The film is also dubbed an action thriller, but there are absolutely no thrills in this movie. There are a couple mild action sequences, but they're mostly cliche and not thrilling at all.""The Tourist"" is more of a romantic comedy, but there's not really any romance. In fact, it's not even very funny. There are a few short comic clips, but not once did I let out more than a subtle chuckle.I actually laughed a lot during the preview and thought ""this movie is gonna be awesome"", but it was a major let down. The roles were well acted, and Depp, Jolie and Bettany are awesome as always, but the story line just isn't there.Add this film to the growing list of disappointing movies released so far in 2011."
4,Loved it,"I'm a fan of Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie so I definitely wanted to watch this. I wasn't disappointed, I really loved the storyline, characters, and music in the movie. I was not expecting the ending either so it was nice to be surprised. Only complaint was that I wasn't that fond of Depp's hair in this. Especially when he's got the white suit on, he reminds me of those caveman commercials where they had that hairdo and suits. Overall, great movie and worth watching"
4,LIght and Entertaining,"This is not an academy-award winner, but it was fun to watch. My fiance and I were pleasantly surprised. Funny and romantic, it was worth watching just to enjoy the beautiful people and places. Worth renting if you're in a light mood and want to relax."
4,It's a luxurious 100 minutes of movie.,I do not understand why this movie had bad reviews when it was in theaters. I usually see every movie that Jolie is in but I waited for the dvd for this one. Now that I've seen it I certainly would not have minded plunking down $7.50 to see it on the big screen.If The Tourist had been made in the 50s or 60s it would be amongst the ranks of North by Northwest. The Tourist has a wonderful look to it. You can NOT guess everything that's going to happen.Angelina Jolie has never looked more stunning and Johnny Depp is very likable.I would have liked the scene on the train to go on a bit longer but that's my only criticism.
3,I was entertained,"The Tourist did not fare well with the critics despite having Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp as the film's leading actors. Jolie plays Elise, a beautiful mysterious English woman. Depp plays Frank, an aloof American tourist. As the film opens we quickly learn that Elise is being followed in hopes that she will lead investigators to her former lover Alexander Pearce. The film has a few twists and turns, but it is described by its director as ""a travel romance with thriller elements.""I enjoyed it. It isn't like the usual big buck American blockbusters, but that is what I enjoyed about it."
1,"Slow, boring & predictable.","I was expecting a whole lot more from this movie. Minus the beauty of Angelina Jolie Voight, the movie was very lethargic and ultimately predictable. I know there is a CSI Effect in movies now, but the reconstructing the burned note was ridiculous (I speak from 13 years police experience). I knew as soon as she met him on the train he was indeed Alexander. A Bugs Bunny plot is more engaging.This moving gets the big ONE thumb down."
4,Good Job!,"As a comedy, it is hilarious; as a romance, it is done tastefully; and as a travel piece, the sceneries are beautiful. This is not meant to be a serious film, but one gets a glimpse of a promising young movie director/writer/artist."
4,I like it,"I enjoyed it better than Salt. It was kind of funny at times, stylish. Not a big screen movie but I did enjoyed the story, specially because I was expecting it to be worst, the chemistry was fine."
4,Amusing action and surprise plot,"The Tourist is an amusing action movie with comedy, intrigue and a surprise ending. I like the actors in almost every movie they have been in so I would guess if you are fan you will also enjoy this movie."
1,Very Disappointing,"If I had gone to watch ""The Tourist"" in the cinema I would have walked out and asked for my money back, bad acting and a total uninteresting story line, seemed more desperation to do a movie with top movie stars! I am no Johnny Depp fan and I think he is over rated and this performance confirms the fact!"
2,Mostly Boring and Predictable Ending.,"Not sure what the idea behind this movie was, perhaps no idea just put Depp and Jolie together. While Angelina was elegant, the movie was boring. There was no mystery, I knew the answers less than 1/2 way through the movie. What really added to making this movie boring was the excessive amount of filler. Scene after scene drags on and on with nothing happening.To like this movie you have to be a serious Depp or Jolie fan who can overlook no plot and no action.To equate this movie to past classic movie does those movies a disservice. The Tourist will never be a classic as it doesn't have a plot and Depp will never be a good actor.If you are looking for a fast paced action thriller mystery, look elsewhere. If you like mysteries, look elsewhere as a child could figure this one out in no time. I wasted $4 on this movie, hope you don't.But on the plus side are great shots of Jolie looking fantastic, great shots of Venice and that's about it."
2,terrible (from a big fan of jolie and depp),"i turned this off. i love depp and i love jolie. first and foremost, the incidental music killed this film. also, depp is wasted on a naive character (even if there is a twist or something. doesn't matter). and jolie walks around like she's on the red carpet. she's almost entirely a statue for the first twenty minutes (or like a vanity fair cover). the director exhibits a cartoonish idea of elegance. go watch mr and mrs smith or salt. go watch public enemies.the first few minutes (all the surveillance stuff) was clumsily shot and edited. it simply had no flow. it was meant to be both comic and exciting, but a film can't really be both a thriller and a comedy. the brilliant 'charade' proved that four decades ago. that was an amazing comedy that failed as a thriller.also, leaden dialogue.avoid this."
2,Pathetic remake.,"If you want to see the good version of this movie watch Anthony Zimmer, the French version which by far excels this one. It has a story with believable characters played by Sophie Marceau & Yves Attal & is filmed in Nice as opposed to Venice. It has action, mystery & romance, all the elements missing from The Tourist. I love Johnny Depp but he had no personality, Angelina Jolie reminded me of Jessica Rabbit (Who killed Roger Rabbit?) whenever she walked anywhere with all the mouths dropping open & everything coming to a halt. Where was the chemistry? There was none. I know she can act, take her performance in Salt, she still looked beautiful but the character she was playing was convincing.This movie was empty, there was a beginning & end but no middle."
1,Horrible....Just Horrible,"This is possibly one of the worst movies I have seen. It is just horrible. The whole move is tongue in cheek, but it seems no one informed the actors or directors.Way too much talent to be wasted on this.."
1,I would give it 0 stars if it was an option.,I honestly just watched this because I wanted to see Johney Depp all cleaned up and sexy looking. It seems like Angelina doesnt care about the quality of the story anymore...all she cares about are if the movie displays her Sexiness & she gets to play with guns and blow up things. Can you say BORING? Unless you are a guy who just wants to drool over Angelina dont bother with this C-grade film. I would tell you the plot but there was none..seriously.
2,Looking for entertainment... Look elsewhere,"I can appreciate something about almost any movie but I couldn't find one nice thing to say about this one. It was just too boring, pointless, and had an implausible, (and dumb) ending. Oh, I just thought of one good thing... eventually, it ended. I wish I had my time back."
2,Yawn...,"1. This is one of those movies where you wanted to like and should have liked... but in the end, the reality was very disappointing. Actually worse yet, it's one of those movies which just leaves one apathetic; ie it was ok, but nothing beyond that. It's so irrelevant that it's not worth even discussing at work with friends etc...2. Bottomline, skip this dud of a movie, unless you happen to come across it for free etc... But even then, is your time worth anything?"
4,Good to augment a textbook,"I purchased this book to provide a second source of information for a college senior/ graduate level geometry class. It was quite helpful at times in giving second explanations of topics covered in class at a price significantly less than the class textbook. The book is comprehensive, and reasonably well written for a math book. One drawback was that it does not discuss Poincare's upper half plane model of hyperbolic geometry, only Poincare's disc model is covered. Inversions are well covered, and one could use this information to map from the disc model to the upper half plane model, so this was not a serious omission. I have no regrets about buying this book."
4,Book Review,"This is a good geometry book far anyone looking to expand on their typical introduction geometry class in college or a college graduate in Mathematics. It does not read like a textbook, it appears the author already assumes you are a Math major or have already taken other geometry courses. The only downside is that it reads like an encyclopedia and does less ""teaching"" that a regular textbook would do. Makes a great reference though!"
3,More advanced than I was looking for,"I was looking for something to help tutor my child, but this is too advanced and thus no good for the purpose I wanted."
4,Surprisingly funny!,"No, this show is certainly not a favorite of critics. But if you just sit there and watch some episodes, it really does make you laugh. The writers really know how to turn marriage into comedy. I'm perfectly happy just sitting back and letting Brad and Joely shine in this surpringly entertaining sitcom. I hope to see it continue to grow in 2007-08 -- it's got a lot of potential, if people would stop dismissing it as garbage."
4,'Till Death - The complete first season,"Good Stuff!Never mind that Brad Garrett is a friend. It also helps that my voice is on two of the episodes.Vegasbooks was very prompt with my order, and it arrived in great condition. I was very pleased and surprised. I've had bad experiences in the past, and you have restored my faith in on line ordering.Thanks,RED"
3,'Til Death has its Funny Moments,"Similar to The Rules of Engagement 'Til Death explores marriage from a newlyweds perspective The Woodcocks (played by Kat Foster and Eddie Kaye Thomas) and a veteran married couple's perspective The Starks (Brad Garrett and Joely Fisher). As Eddie Stark, Garrett is the mentor to the young Jeff Woodcock (Thomas). He tells him about the ins and outs of marriage, the arguments which ensues between married couples over trivial issues and what it takes to keep a marriage together. As a married couple, Garrett and Fisher had believable comedic banter as they fought over issues like paying the bills, unplugging the toaster oven, and, um,....pan pizza.'Til Death featured the sexy and attractive Kat Foster as Jeff's young wife Steph Woodcock. It wasn't an original sitcom but 'Til Death certainly had its funny moments."
3,confused,"I love the ""Til Death"" series but I'm Still having a problem viewing it. I'm only able to watch 2/3 of the full 1st season. ?????? I returned the discs and they were replaced with no problem, but I still have the the same problem viewing the all the the epasodes and I can't figure out why. So In that sense I am very disatisfied.Maybe if someone reads this they can tell me why. Thank you, Grumpy"
1,Don't use this on a violin,"As recently reviewed for 'Fingerboard Tape: Yello' don't buy this to put it onto a stringed instrument. It doesn't stick well and when it does, it removes the varnish from the neck of the violin when you take it off."
1,Broken Jewelry received. Crappy quality,DO NOT BUY JEWELRY from this seller. Received broken earings and gold was inferior quality!
4,amusing characters,"very amusing, absurd situations. key west is full of characters similar to these. i would recommend for a fun read."
3,Phase Two,"I accidentally re-purchased Key Wierd again, forgetting that I had already read it. It was the first Robert Tacoma book I read. I re-read it, since I bought both Wierd and Wierder at the same time. Both were pretty shallow, but Wierder seems like Mr. Tacoma was just trying to kick out a book as fast as easily as he could. Not much to recommend, unless you want to see how Wierd ends up."
3,OK but weird,This was an ok plot with great Key West imagery and some very imaginative travelogue. I enjoyed some aspects of life in the Keys but it wasn't up there with Tom Corcoran.
2,It was OK,"It was an OK book. I am a big fan of all the South Florida twisted books. I will likely read a some of his other books, you can beat the price."
2,Economic history at its worst,"If you really want to show historians how useless economic history is, write a book like this one. To Ekelund and Tollison, the mercantile era is the rent seeking model, and nothing more. If you get the model, you get 200 years of history in a graph. If you are unconvinced, you must be a moron, according to these gentlemen. Ignorance about history is a virtue, one suspects."
1,No research from the author...,I can't believe this is the same author that wrote Deadly Thrills. Jaye obviously threw this book together as quickly as possible. The author may want to read her work before publication as there were MANY incorrect dates and names. Do your research and know what you are talking about Jaye. This book was a true waste of time!
3,It's interesting...,"Definitely a funny show, very vulgar and past the point of suggestive. Definitely makes me cringe from time to time, but it's funny stuff. Not sure if I would recommend it to some parties, but who knows. It is just all sorts of messed up lol."
2,Not really that funny...just ok,"It's entertaining at best, but not funny. Pretty rough & raw topics though. Characters not likable at all. I just found it mildly amusing. My significant other gave it to me, she knows I liked The League, Archer, It's Always Sunny, Eastbound & Down, but this is far, very far from those shows."
1,MCGUIRE CARPENTERS APRON 90427,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM MCGUIRE AT ALL THE APRON WAS OIL TANNED LEATHER WHEN THEY TANNED THE APRON GOT VERY HARD AND NOT PLIABLE AT ALL I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SOFTEN IT UP FOR A MONTH NOW AND STILL ROCK HARD I PURCHASED A SIMALER APRON THAT WAS NOT OIL TANNED AND ITS NO WARE NEAR AS HARD
4,Early Gong with heavy tape-looping effects.,"This is early Gong with Daevid presenting a heavy dose of tape looping effects and some of his most entertaining and wacked-out lyrical, vocal, and musical ideas. Even more guitar-oriented than later releases. The material is darker than the subsequent Gong trilogy."
4,This helps,Nothing much exciting to say. This is effective. I have thoracic outlet syndrome. This strap is comfortable. They are all a little difficult to get into. It does help to keep the shoulders back. The price was good. Give it a try.
5,Compact and complete,"This set is an excellent assortment of drawing and sketching paraphernalia; compact and lightweight, it can be carried anywhere. It was intended as my first gift for my Girlfriend (now Fiancée) who loves to sketch and paint, and it turned out she was delighted to receive it."
5,8-year-old loved it,"8-year-old boy really liked this one. Lots of items and the bag is great! I felt the drawing instructional booklet added very little value, so I bought separate books from art supply store to put in the bag. Overall great value and nice presentation."
5,These little cards have a BIG impact!,"The cards are good because they focus on one reading skill at a time and let students build their reading level as they work on a specific skill, like reading for detail. The cards are good for a center activity, for one-on-one with a teacher or parent volunteer, or for kids to do in pairs."
5,Awesome!,My first Skagen. Purchased 9/30/08 Excellent watch for the money. I bought mine at a local dealer for a great price. Amazon's price is great and combined with the watches life time warranty makes it a must buy if you want a light stylish watch that will get noticed!
1,More like Mary Lou Williams Versus Cecil Taylor,"If this wasn't a live album and you could use the balance knob to completely isolate the two pianists, you might have a couple of pretty good solo albums here. Listening to them together, though, it's a complete mess, with neither player compromising his or her respective style a whit. I can understand CT's approach, because his entire career has been based on listening to the other musicians and responding in his own unique language. However, for Williams to go on playing her standard history of jazz program without making the slightest attempt to acknowledge Taylor's contribution in her playing is utterly absurd. Give it a miss."
3,The truth: CT buries MLW,"Williams camped attacked Cecil on this recording from all angles possible. The truth lies in the fact that Mary Lou was buried by Mr. Taylor at this experience. It is an interesting recording to hear Taylor again in a traditional setting working off Williams work, streaming out into his extraordinary talent that hardlly any mere bop player could realize or hang with. Advant garde listeners will enjoy this work and their suspicions realized that Cecil is far advanced beyond their world."
3,Fair - Missed important topics,"Was delighted to open the book up. The author does not treat you like a complete novice and assume certain level of automatic understanding from the readers. I was able to cover the quick introduction to the common features in the C# language. Rest of the chapters have a lot of example scenarios in it so helped me with getting my arms around day-to-day problems quickly.However, some of the areas I had hoped the book would help me:1. There is no treatment on file systems. In Java, there is a strong support for reading/writing file systems, but the book totally bypassed this.2. Delegates - This is new concept in .NET and I had hoped the autor would explain this topic in more detail in the early chapters, and especially since the Event management is heavily based on the delegates concept.Overall, a good and useful book for quick induction into .NET world."
3,thigh toner,my grandaughter loves the thigh toner and uses it everyday.glad i purchase the item for her.
2,Flimsy and cheap,"Now, first I will say that I do get a little bit of a burn from this.BUT.This device is constructed with EXTREMELY flimsy material. The plastic in the middle that covers the spring gaps and pinches when you squeeze. Most annoying of all, however, is the fact that the interior wire does not go all the way around the loop. If you look at the picture, the interior support wire only goes about an inch down after it makes its second turn. The rest is just foam. This means that pressure isn't distributed evenly and you end up with one end digging into your thighs.Basically, if I knew what I know now I would have bought some resistance bands instead. This isn't worth the money."
2,terrible quality,"i just received this product in the mail, took it out of the package and i couldn't believe how poorly it was made. its very flimsy and flies right out from whatever position i have it in. i would not recommend this to anyone, please save your money and go with something else."
3,does what its suppose to,This works nice enough. the foam around the arms does move around a good amount but not enough to defer anything. overall it works!!
2,not happy,"i just received this product today and tried it out, its rather uncomfortable and the middle plactic thing fell apart imediately, it still works but its anoying to have plastic popping out. also the outer thigh exercise was pretty impossible its just too big for that exercise, but then again i am 5'2."
4,toner,The bally to.tal fitness thigh toner works well and it comes with a workout sheet. It it great for the price.
4,Not blue,"I like it, it does what it says, and I am 5'7"" and have had no problems using it as it is supposed to be used.I just didn't like that it said it was out of the pink one, for the lesser price, so I bought this one and ended up with the pink one."
3,toner thighs!,I actually bought this for my daughter who accidentally broke the old one she has had for a while & its steel? She seems to be satisfied with it so I hope this one will last a bit more longer.
1,"Disappointed, but it's cheap so...","Cons:- Flimsy- Plastic over the spring came apart first thing- Plastic part that goes over the end of the wire inside the foam also fell off first thing- At only 5', my thighs are too short for the thigh toner to fit right to do the outer thigh exercise- When working the inner thigh, have to either hang on to it or readjust after every squeeze (it's off balance and twists from out from between my legs- Resistance is too lowPros:- Works good for the tricep squeeze and chest, (but still needs more resistance)- Inexpensive (but you get what you pay for)- Good idea in theory"
2,shipping fast product okay,"The shipping was fast and efficient. The product itself is cheap and really does not work well. It does bend like it states, but it slips out of place with every move. I would recommend to purchase something else that costs a little more but would not be a garage sale item."
2,Kathy,I find this product to be hard to use--it keeps shifting around & by the time you readjust it between each rep it gets frustrating. The arm excercises are easier cause you can keep control but the leg excercises are when it shifts constantly. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
3,"Not a bad product, just ok.","There are two things about this toner that I don't care for.1) As you use it, it tends to slide one way or the other so you have reposition it alot or hold it in place with your hands.2) I think the resistance should be a greater, with daily use it won't take long before surpassing that level of resistance."
1,"very poor quality, comes apart easily, thin padding bruises you","Bally Total Fitness Thigh Toner: good price...too good, fast ship, but very low quality. The plastic case over the spring falls off with any use. The foam padding is way too thin even for already toned legs. It will bruise you very easily. Spend a little more. This is just too cheap to be any good at all. Obviously an attempt to make a few bucks on the bally name, we thought it might be decent from Bally. Nope."
2,"Eh, Go with another model.","I have had a thigh toner before, which I really liked. I expected this one to be just as good. It is too small and flimsy. It needs to be repositioned after each rep. The spring in the middle keeps becoming exposed. It pinches. It is not quite symmetric, which makes it really awkward to use. Boo."
2,serves a purpose....not sure which,This is a silly purchase....moment of weakness shopping for junk i guess....its now my dogs play toy as it does not much of anything.
2,try another brand...,"I really enjoy using this product, and the results i am getting. However, quality of this brand left me disappointed. The cushion around arms is not thick enough, I can feel the wire!, so unless you wear thick leggings, be prepared to get bruises.Also, the spring system is ready to crack. I have only had it less than a month and use it once a day.Having had same equipment before but different brand, I can safely say: TRY ANOTHER BRAND!"
1,Find a different one,This thing is cheaply/poorly made. I wish I would of found a different one. Difficult to use without it alipping everywhere or flinging.
2,Not quite what I expected,"If you look at the picture, it appears that the loops almost completely come around close to the center with rounded edges. This is not the case. The loops are much shorter, with the rod stopping about half-way to the hinge. They are too too long for me and are very uncomfortable with the squared corners. The padding is also insufficient and the hinge is fairly loose, so does not provide nearly the difficulty it should to be beneficial.Overall, a very disappointing product, although it does work. If you were quite new to exercise and needed little resistance and were at least about 5'8"", it might work alright, but you would soon exercise past it's usefulness and need something sturdier."
3,"Works fine, but is flimsy","This product works fine, but it's sort of cheap/flimsy. I didn't expect it to be super-high quality though, so I'm satisfied with the purchase of it. Good for working your inner thighs!"
1,Buyer Beware,Sellers description of this item was accurate up to a point. Not a bad seller just a bad product. The item is very poorly made and cheap. Mine broke within a week and is so cheap that it's not worth the trouble to return. You get what you pay for. Spend a little more money and get a better product.
1,Cheap,"This product is cheaply made - so much so that it is impossible to use. If it wasn't such a pain to get back into its box, I would have returned it. Bottom line: SAVE YOUR MONEY."
2,Don't waste your money,"I found this product to be quite charming (electric blue pads- CUTE!) but flimsy. I had trouble holding it in place while doing the thigh and arm workouts. If you are looking for a good toner, keep looking. Maybe if you are very petite and have short legs you might be able to work it but I wasn't. I'm 5'7 and have long legs, it was just too awkward to do. Not a fan."
3,Works well with what I need it to do.,"This is the first thigh-toner device I have ever purchased to work out with. It works really well for the most part. After a couple of weeks, I am getting used to the resistance and may end up having to purchase a new one. I can feel my thighs becoming more tone and it does do that. The only major problem I've been having is that the center piece often separates, exposing the spring and the ""wing"" part becomes uneven. You have to put a hand on the center to prevent this from happening, which is a little annoying. Other than that, I am overall, happy with the results it has given me."
1,waste of money,"waste of money, the original was MUCH better. Very flimsy and unstable. Would cost more to return than it's worth..."
4,Works well,"Let's face it, the quality of this thing is super cheap. It feels flimsy and definitely not the quality of the original brand. That being said, it gets the job done and is inexpensive. If I wanted quality, I would have paid more. I feel the burn and am sore after I use it, so I don't really care that it feels cheap. Works very well :)."
3,Not for Individuals with Short Legs,I am satisfied with the Bally Total Fitness Thigh Toner for the inner thigh exercises but because my legs are short I cannot do the outer thigh exercises which is disappointing. I wish they had made the toner somehow adjustable for different heights.
1,This is golden with diamonds,The price is amazing.Usually is less than $20....Sometimes you can get it for free as a gift. :)
2,Bally Total Fitness Thigh Toner... Not for small build ppl,"I would say this product is not good for small built ppl. I'm 4'10"" and it's very uncomfortable to use it as ""thigh toner"". It does better job as ""Tricepts toner""... So...not what i expected.Also as others mentionned, this exerciser is pretty cheaply made, plastic parts are falling apart pretty easily...So...i'm happy that i paid for this piece of junk just 10 bucks... doesn't do any job in my case at all :-(."
3,works but awkward,"I like it and it works like it should, but it is just not very ""stable"". It is not completely connected and I think it makes it a little flimsy. Well like I said it does the job though."
2,flimsy...fell apart in less than two weeks,"Initially I thought it looked okay. The heart dangle was not solid as I had hoped. I had to constantly flip it around to face the right way. 10 days later the heart fell off completely, the link had completely disintegrated. Don't waste your money on this!! You get what you pay for, I guess..."
5,Way deeper than it looks,"This movie is ostensibly about a prizefighter from the early to mid 1960's who was undoubtedly one of the best of his era. It is really a deep look at the heart of a man and the struggles and triumphs that occur, outside his life in the ring. My wife could care less about boxing and by the end of this movie, she and I were both moved to tears. Needless to say this movie did not have an advertising budget to speak of, but it tells one heck of a story. Most surprising of all perhaps, is the fact that all of it is true."
2,Ring of Fire,Badly done. I only watched it to the end because I met the 'champ' back in the 1960s in NYC.
2,Extremely DIRTY DVD,"This DVD would barely play it was so dirty. I cleaned it myself, but it still tends to skip or stop. Not worth the money."
3,The Man is Interesting - The Film is Pedestrian.,"I just finished watching this film about the captivating and tortured boxer, Emile Grigffith. Luckily, his story (which I won't reiterate since other reviewers say what it's about) is a compelling one that saves this rather mundane approach from being too dull to watch. I also feel the filmmakers gloss over certain subjects, like Mr. Griffith's sexuality, far too much. For those who say his sexuality is his business (and to a certain degree, it is), I say it's such an integral element of the story that it needs more prominence in the film. It feels too much like an afterthought, mostly because Mr. Griffith appears entrenched in denial. The filmmakers should have pressed more to get at the core of this obviously important issue in his life. However, having said that, I still recommend the film to anyone interested in this tragic and ultimately redemptive story."
5,Ring of Fire - The Emile Griffith Story,"I was eleven in 1962 and my family was among those who were regular television fight fans. I'm sure that we were in from of the set for this fight. I enjoyed the archival footage and the interviews with all of the participants. Of course, like others, I became weepy in parts of the footage.I thank Misters Klores and Berger for giving me a chance to relive, not a tragic moment, but a joyous era when American enjoyed the art of boxing, fathers and sons could share moments. Long live Emile Griffith, Archie Moore, Sugar Ray Robinson, Gene Fulmer and the gladiators who entertained us with the sport of boxing during the golden days."
4,All in One,"Tales From the Captain's Table is a great anthology of first-person Star Trek prose. From Jonathan Archer of the Enterprise NX-01 to William T. Riker and the U.S.S. Titan, this book contains stories that span much of the Star Trek universe--Keith R. A. DeCandido even throws in a little Klingon, too.My favorite stories were Jean-Luc Picard, as told by Michael Jan Friedman, and Klag, as told by Keith R. A. DeCandido. Peter David, whose writing I sometimes dislike, put in a great piece from Elizabeth Shelby's point of view. Christie Golden adds her Voyager-based tale about Chakotay's coming of age, and Heather Jarman gives us a glimpse of Kira Nerys' time in the Bajoran Resistance, both of which were also written well.All in all, I had a great time reading this book. Although nothing sticks out in my mind as an absolute gemstone of literary work, Tales From the Captain's Table definitely provided a beautiful spectrum of Star Trek writing."
3,Not thrilled,"As a big Star Trek fan, I have or have read most books thus far. I found some of the tales to be rather boring and in some cases much too bloody. What saves this book from the garage sale are the few fine tales that are sure to please. All in all, I was not thrilled by this book."
4,Silly concept very well executed.,"As I've been saying ever since the concept was introduced, the Captain's Table concept is a very silly concept, at least within the framework of the Star Trek universe, but the stories in this book, as with the previous novels dealing with the concept, are very well-written. The Captain's Table is essentially an interstellar ""Callahan's Crosstime Saloon"" placed in the Star Trek universe, and while I loved the Callahan's stories by Spider Robinson, I don't think the concept works within that framework. But the stories it produces are good enough that I can't help but give at least a passable rating to the book; I've just decided to ignore the silly framework."
4,Okay read,I'm guilty of only reading the Captain's Table story of William T Riker. I read it and though it was and exciting read it seemed to bounce around a lot. Some times I didn't know if I was on their honeymoon or back discussing it Captain Picard. Honeslty Will really shouldn't have discussed his honeymoon with Picard its supposed to be private. Other then that it was a good read.
5,High quality,"Great quality it has held up very well. The softer veggies loss there crinkle if cooked too long. I like it as a spice blade for fresh herbs. Nice design, good size, and sharp blade."
1,OLD NUMBERS...,"SINCE HE CHANGED HIS NUMBER TO 24!!! NUMBER DOES NOT NOT COUNT ANYMORE, SO I HAVE TO PARK MY FIGURE NO.8 ON THE SHELVES OF NO RETURN. UNFORTUNATELY"
4,How to get the best grades with the least amount of effort,"This is a really good book, it is short and straight to the point on what matters when you study. It is not complicated and it is written in a language even a 12 year old can understand. I knew most of the studying techniques the author talks about, but I knew them unconsciously since I do some of the techniques already. But what really impressed me is how real and simple these techniques were, it doesn't preach you must be a whiz kid to learn them. All it takes is time and dedication. All in all, great book and one all academia must have."
4,I really like it.,"It is a wonderful gun. As a pistol owner, this bb gun is very realistic as far as loading, cocking and the blowback action. An excellent gun to train someone on or teach someone with in preparation for real pistols. And the fact that it is a Walther PPK/s (the James Bond gun) just sweetens the deal. The only draw back is the gun is pretty weak because of the blowback action. If you just want a really cool bb gun, this is the coolest, but if you want something powerful and accurate then i would recommend to keep researching. for power and accuracy the Crosman Storm XT is phenominal."
3,Nice work,"I bought this cd for the song Word Up. I think it's one of the best versions of this song, the other 3 songs are basically forgettable. And the version of Gimme That Old Time Religion just sounded like filler."
2,OK for improving test taking skills,"If you want to get experience in taking computer based tests this review is OK. But: Questions are far from Step 3 format, level of difficulty is highly variable, some explanations are outdated. If I had to choose again I would pick something different."
5,Excellent . . . Excellent . . . Excellent,"I've had Chris Knopf on my list for so long that at the time he had only written The Last Refuge and now has 4 books out. I finally ordered from another bookseller, just finished it and on the strength of the first book am going to order the next 3. I won't go into a summary of the character or book as other Amazon reviewers have done so. I don't drink Absolut and have no desire to sit out in a cold screened in porch looking at the water, but am having second thoughts after reading The Last Refuge."
2,Not a Great Experience,"The picutre the seller had in the ad was different from the item described so I didn't get what I thought I ordered. When I emailed them for return instructions I got a snotty reply. They did eventually refund the purchase price and original shipping, they did not pay for the return shipping...I had to eat that. The picture in the ad has now been changed to the correct item. Overall an unsatisfactory experience."
1,Don't do it!,"It just took me one song to eliminate them from my mind. I'm glad I heard that for free (on yahoo launchcast). I fast forwarded this crap so fast, so I can get here to give you my comment. This is the first comment I put on this site in the many many many times i've been here. So I must be bothered by this group to put this in writing. Beware! I only heard one song though.."
3,Not very focussed....,"Very fluffy. Too much explanation of basic hardware; not enough regarding B&W; technique. The introduction to Zone was adequate, but wasn't really linked to the discussion of technique, which seemed to be mostly a generic Photoshop lesson, anyway.It was like three superficial books sewn together."
4,good product,I have the V557 and we needed the case because it seems like the keys scratch the screen. The case covers the whole screen as well as from 456 down on the keypad. Stays in place pretty well. There are only a few cons. First the two halves snap together and this loops when it is open. This often blocks the camera and easily comes undone. It also seems a bit bulky but not bad. Otherwise for the price it is a very good product.
3,not the best book to use..at least for me it wasn't,"first of all, this book as many typos and horrible explanations for the practice tests. secondly, if you are not good at net ionic equations, don't buy this book, it has almost nothing useful regarding this topic. my suggestion for the net ionic section is princeton review 2004-2005, it has a very organized and comprehensive section with common trends that we should look for.though i must say that it's descriptive chemistry section is better than some books'. finally, GOOD LUCK!"
5,It's effective,"My son knew exactly what it was for after only a few times. He still has difficulty being quiet while he's in time out, but he stays on that spot!I like that it's easy to put out, easy to put up, and has a no slip grip on the bottom."
5,Time out rug,Love this. This is loud enough to deter mine from misbehaving. They don't want the embarrassment of sitting on this in the middle of the store. Great idea!
4,Nice product,"I was really excited to get the Take-Out Time-Out mat. I thought that it would work, but my son kept getting out all the time! I would stand my him and make sure he would sit there, but he thought it was a game! I guess it depends on your childs personality as my son thinks that life is so fun and always a joke! Maybe it would work if he is a little older (he is 2). Otherwise the product was nice and i liked the little bag it came with! Will try it again with my other kids!"
3,GHOST,"THIA IN- NAME-ONLY SEQUEL TO FREDA'S THE HORRIBLE DR. HITCHCOCK HAS STEELE IN ONE OF HER BEST ROLES AS THE PERFIDIOUS WIFE OF DR. H,WHO PLOTS WITH LOVER BALDWIN TO MURDER HER HUBBY,WHO RETURNS FROM THE TOMB TO DRIVE THE COUPLE TO MADDNESS AND DEATH."
5,A book with heart and grit,"I would be less than honest if I didn't admit that the book and its situations disturbed me, they did. This is not to say however, that I found the book anything less than wonderfully written. The book brings out a clear image of the day-to-day terror that exists in some families. Having lived in a warm and nurturing household, it was difficult for me to grasp until the end.I give Jane Basta two hearty thumbs up for her excellent work. I will certainly be first in line for her next book."
5,A glimpse into a very harsh society that exists in this world.,"It is a glimpse into the harsh reality of the world of religious abuse, spousal abuse, alcoholism, and rape. Many people turn their heads away and do not do anything about this kind of thing, and have chosen to remain ignorant about such things. This book gives them a look into this kind of terror and horror and the fact that this exists in many places, some of which I have seen myself. I give many, many, many kudos and both thumbs up to Jane Basta for her wonderful job in writing this very disturbing and difficult book. She is an excellent author!- A.J.A. in San Antonio, Texas"
5,Good Chives,I love to have chives on hand to cook with. The ones in the supermarkets are expensive and you only get a tiny amount in the containers. I find them to be stale as well. These are fragrantly strong and you can't argue with the amount of product contained in the canister. As a matter of fact I have placed another order; that's how pleased I am!
1,"Love the show, but here's the reason for 1 star...","Love the show, but I suggest buying the DVD set from Discovery Channel! It's now on sale & usually will be until Christmas!It includes an additional disc, (which I assume will be the one missing from this set) with the following extras:*Deleted Scenes*After the Catch Episodes*Chasing the Catch 'Minisodes' (these were clips featured online from the Chase Boat's Point-of-View)*1 Hour Tribute to Phil Harris Feature*1 Hour Behind-The-Scenes Episode (featuring the filming crew & additional Cpt. Harris clips/info)* Cash Cab Episode 200 (featuring the men of Deadliest Catch)"
3,slim on content,I have already received the Discovery Store Season Six set and it is more expensive but it is also much more complete. If you are a true fan I would suggest that set. It is far more comprehensive than this set offered by Amazon. That seems to be the case in everything that is first released by the actual producer of a series on cable. If you only wish to see what was aired on television this set offered by Amazon is wonderfully priced.
3,deadliest catch season 6,typical of the series however the crews are getting to the point where they are always trying to get cuute for the camera
3,incomplete,"This is one of greatest shows on TV...but buy this season direct from the Discovery Channel. You get an additional disc of content (5 discs total including 'After the Catch') and it's available right now. It's a little more expensive, but for the extra disc, it's worth it!!!*I'm excited that the Time Bandit and the Northwestern will be returning for season 7!!"
4,B-day sibling with 2 yr old twin brother & sister feels sorry 4 herself,"Older sister of twins (2 year olds) discovers it's no fun to have a brother AND sister with the T-T's. It is her birthday and she is feeling forgotten and sad. She decides to run away. She is visited by the care bears who try and cheer her and emphathise. She considers all the things she could do (circus,...) As she is thinking it over in her clubhouse... her friends begin arriving for what she discovers is her surprise birthday party. She realizes the Terrible two's won't last forever because they'll have a b-day of their own soon."
5,"If you like Erasure, you'll LOVE DavidMahr","Very much like Erasure, this album is up-beat and has a great rhythm. We're all ""lucky, lucky"" to have it available for our listining pleasure."
3,batteries not included,"Cool game and all, box calls for 4 ""D"" cells and 3 ""9v"" batteries, we got home and not only is there absolutelyno need for D's or 9v's anywhere in the game, the 4 AA's you do need to use the microscope you left at the store because thebox makes no mention of needing them!! grrrrrrrr"
2,Gang style hat,"I bought this hat for my daughter. It looks like a normal ball cap from the pictures but it is really more ""gang style"" with a flat brim and very rounded crown. If that is what you are looking for, you will like it. We just wanted a regular hat and were VERY disappointed."
3,ok hat,it's very hard. and i don't like the shape of front side of hat. it's like rectangular shape that pops out.. hopefully later it will get loose and natural looking. i like it adjustable. color is fine and bright.
3,It's A Hat,Wasn't looking for anything special and didn't get anything special. It's a hat and for a low cost. :)
4,Tale of Revenge,"I read this one several years ago. I've always been a fan of both Ruby Jean Jensen and horror stories involving children, and this one didn't disappoint me! Sightings of children who disappeared long ago and haven't changed, including a little girl who still clutches the doll she had when she disappeared, bring a sense of foreboding to a town.A reverend in the town knows the sightings of the children mean something is about to happen, that revenge is going to be sought. Something once took the children away, and now it's time for The Reckoning.This is a great horror novel to get your hands on! An original tale of revenge you'll enjoy reading in bed that will bring you dreams of mysterious children, it's not going to give you a cozy feeling. Absolute fun to read!"
3,Ken Ishii - Metal Blue America,"_Metal Blue America_ represents a departure from the more pure techno of _Jelly Tones_. Instead, we get the fierce hip-hop breaks of the title track or the funk bass and jump-up attitude in ""Actio Surrealismo."" What can we make of the police siren electro of ""Super Fly"" or the swirling breaks of ""Spinous Blue""? How does one reconcile that with the calmer groove of ""Decrescendo"" or the wild percussion of ""Drummelter""? ""Jet'n Rush"" has some of the pitch-drawn tones that made ""Stretch"" a classic, but doesn't quite hit the same level. ""Butter Bump"" is some more familiar hard techno, but nothing as complex as can be found on his earlier work. Indeed, you can hear in this track the genesis of his later work as FLR. Each track is quite enjoyable on its own, but the parts don't quite add up to a whole."
5,Breaking the Body Mind Code,"Maggie Scarf is at her best in this case study exploration of the way the body stores life's traumas. The idea of a body-mind connection is hardly new; it's even fashionable. What Scarf offers the reader, in addition to a compelling read, are real insights into how these traumas can be identified, how they become locked in the body, and, most impressively, how they may be unlocked. Secrets, Lies, Betrayals: The Body/Mind Connection,like her landmark study of women and depression, Unfinished Business, is a ""must read"" and a ""must know."""
5,Fabulous book!,"I love this book! The pictures are beautiful, the story is wonderful, and my daughter loves to bring up the book when she sees the moon is up during the day, or a lady bug lands near her."
5,wonderful,I gave this book to a sister who was about to get her first grand daughter. I know she will enjoy reading it to the baby.
4,Very cute book,Slightly long but the story is very cute. Talks Bout how loved your child is and how special they are
5,Everything you've wanted to say to your child...,"This was a birthday gift for my nine year old son. Every birthday and Kwanzaa I purchase one special book for him. I am in love with Nancy Tillman's books anyway, however, this is the first one I have purchased. The illustrations are simply beautiful, very soft - kind of like watercolors. If you have a child who likes animals - they will appreciate the illustrations. Most importantly - the book reads like a poem (not in iambic pentameter or rhyme). It isn't wordy which lends itself to a warm, whimsical nature. My favorite part is the very last page which simply reads, ""You are loved."" This book is very appropriate and of the correct quality (hardback) for gift-giving. It is very well-suited for younger children or, as in my case, as a special something for a tender-hearted older child. You can't go wrong. Enjoy!"
3,i love this book but...,"the words and pictures don't together. The pictures are on the back of the page, so you when you are reading, you are looking the picture that goes with the previous page's text. Seems like a pretty big oversight on the printer's part. Add to that that the pictures are pretty obscure. Other than that, beautiful book."
5,It brought me to tears,"I cried in the delivery room when my first son was born in January and this book brought back all of the same emotions the first time we read it. Both my wife and I were in tears by the end of the book. In fact, I read it to Matthew again today and could barely get the words out at the end. Its a wonderful story to tell a child how special he/she really is. I definitely recommend it for all new parents."
5,A BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE EVERYONE NEEDS TO HEAR,"This book is for any parent who's head over heels in love with their little blessing! The message in this book is great. It reminds your child that they are a beautiful, wonderful, unique gift from God and that there never was and there never will be another child like them.My son received this as a gift for his 2nd birthday and we both LOVE it! It will be my ""go to"" book for any baby shower from now on! My son likes pointing out the different animals in the pictures and the loving words always bring a tear to my eye. In fact, I love it so much, I just bought the baby book The Wonder of You by the same author for my 6 month old."
5,Another hit by Nancy,I absolutely love this book and so does my grand daughter. It's one that we read over and over and never get tired of. It holds her attention and is just wonderfully written. Lovely illustrations as well!
5,On The Night You Were Born,"I bougt this book for my daughter who is having her first baby. It is a beatiful, moving story to read to a child.Full of love and tenderness to show your child how much they are loved. Beautiful!"
5,Brought happy tears to my eyes,This is a warm tender book about the wonder of being a parent and grandparent.
5,"Wonderful book, wonderful message","I bought this book for a friend's baby, and just read it (carefully) before wrapping it up. This is a great book! It has a wonderful message for young children - that they are special and loved.I loved the flow of the book, as well as the ""activities"" (count 1-2-3 and I'll tickle your toes) that went along with some of the pages. The illustrations are gorgeous, as well.I recommend this book for new babies and older children, too!"
5,Love it!,"2 1/2 year old daughter constantly requests this book. I think she enjoys the pictures and the concept of being born. As her mother, I enjoy the most sentimental story and pictures!"
5,A beautiful tribute to every child's uniqueness,"My daughter absolutely LOVES this book! It's her favorite. It is a wonderful reminder to all children that they are loved, unique and special. The illustrations are gorgeous and the book reads like a lullabye! Buy one for every special child you know. It makes a great birthday gift!"
5,An Excellent Baby Book,This is an excellent book. The first time my wife read it to our infant it literally brought tears to her eyes because it is very touching.
2,"Can you say ""Over-board"" book?","Don't get me wrong, I love my kid, and I want them to know that, but this book is too much for me. It's way too schmaltzy. I felt like a fog should have been rolling in while I read it, with so kind of harp played by woodland critters. However, if that's what you're looking for then this is definitely for you. Just don't invite my kid to your kid's birthday party."
3,AN ENDEARING BOOK,"This is a wonderfull book for parents to read to their child or grandparents. It will give a child the feeling of knowing it was a special time when they were born, and every child should feel that.I think the artwork could be better but it is the message that counts here. I was a little dissappointed that I did not get the recordable book as it was advertized. But there is a recordable one available. But I will still get great pleasure from sharing this book and reading it to my grandchildren and through this simplistic wonderfull little story, I will instill in them that they were loved and wanted and are very special."
2,Poor quality version of this book!,The original version of this book by Darling Press is much more high quality... included book cover and glossy pages. This one seems cheep in comparison. I would not have purchased it if I had known it would be this version. The story is wonderful so I'd still recommend that you purchase it.
5,excellent book,I bought this for my child and have bought it as a baby gift for friends many times since. Everyone loves it. Very endearing.
5,Our favorite book!,"Our son was born at night, which is why I bought the book - just for the title. We read it to him everynight, and even now, 6 months later, I still get choked up while reading it.We love the message of it - that there is only one YOU ever - and will read this to our son as long as he lets us.Best book we have in his library - by far."
1,On the Night You Were Born,"I was very pleased with this book. The illustrations and story are lovely! I am grateful to have the ""ease"" of shopping on AMAZON...and your suggestions are helpful. I purchased 2 copies..my 1st grandson who was born in June...and my 1st gradaughter who arrived in August! The book was a nice chioce...and their parents were thrilled.Thanks,Marian Hester"
4,Beautiful book but Psalms verse included,"I purchased this for my friend who just had a baby. It's lovely! The gist is that on the night the child is born, all the animals celebrated. I love the illustrations, though I think the one of the polar bears dancing is the best (it's a page inside the book too).The only thing I would mention is that it has a verse from Psalms 139 in the front which made me pause, because my friend is a Buddhist. I still ended up giving her the book, because I know it does not take away from the beautiful pictures or the loving message of the story, but I may have decided on another book instead had I known."
5,Great book!,"We received this book as a gift for our son. Gorgeous pictures and such a great message to all kids. You're special, loved and important! Definitely one of our favorites!"
5,Nice!,This is a nice book. I bought it for my daughters baby shower and so did 3 others. So it was a def. hit!
3,Good book -- not good shape,"I ordered this book for a baby shower, in addition to ""On the Day You Were Born"". Both books are wonderful. However, this book arrived with a crease down the middle of every page. There was not time to return the book before the shower. Otherwise, I was happy with Amazon service."
3,You were born,"Not the type of book I was expecting, but thankfully a family is due to deliver soon and will gift it to them."
3,On the night you were born,"I was so disappointed when I received my 3 books today. When I went on this site , I entered recordable books. So needless to say when I ordered three copies of this book, I thought I would be able to have my voice recorded to read the books to my grandchildren. Not, so sad...First time I have ordered from Amazon, so will have to be more careful next time and really look the site I search to make sure am getting what I thought I was............ I read the book and liked what it had to say, so am keeping them, but still very disappointed....."
2,Expected much better for something with so many positive reviews,"Reading this to my child made me feel like I was trying to convince him he wasn't really a loser before he'd even spoken his first word or taken his first step. I like the idea of promoting the idea to children that they are unique and loved, but I'm not comfortable trying to convince them that they are special because polar bears dance for them. It seems like we parents should be doing that ourselves. In a word, I found this book ""creepy."""
2,Ehhh... Boring,"This book is boring, it doesn't hold my son's attention at all. It seems like it's more for the parents, or much older children than my 2 year old. Also the pages don't match, you are reading something while your child is looking at a picture of what you read before. Doesn't make any sense to me. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because the illustrations are pretty, but that's about all this book has going for it."
2,"A rip-off of The Day You Were Born, by Debra Frazier","When I saw this book in the bookstore, I almost got whiplash. Such a rip-off of Debra Frazier's book, ON THE DAY YOU WERE BORN. Hard to get past that. I stood there and read it, but I would not buy it. Instead, I reread Frazier's book, which I have given as a gift several times."
2,Eh...it's just OK...I don't get all the hype.,"I bought this book for my son for Valentine's Day - I was looking for books about love and after seeing all of the 5 star reviews this one had, I figured I'd found a real winner. I really wanted to like it and wanted my son to love it, but it is just not that great, sorry!"
1,Creepy illustrations; my daughter doesn't like it,"This book has weird, creepy illustrations. There are scary looking faces on each page inside of the moon. Overall, it is a very dark and gloomy book. The graphics don't even hold my toddler's attention. She'd much rather look at real picture book or brightly illustrated books. We got this as a gift, but I'm giving it to Goodwill!!"
5,Touching and Heartwarming,I received this book as a birthday present a few months after my son was born. I cried like a baby the first time I read it. It is so very poignant. And the illustrations are beautiful. It is now one of my favorite bed time reads to my 10 month old son. It lets him know just how very special he is to me and the rest of the world. :o) Perfect gift for a new baby.
5,The book every child should have.,"I got on Amazon to purchase a different book as a baby gift for a friend. This one came up as a suggestion, it looked good so I ordered it. I was not disapointed. I loved this book. The story line is thoughtful and eloquent. The art is fantastic and wimsical. I have bought many many copies of Maryann Cousamano's ""You are My I Love You"". I will be buying and giving this one too! It is a book a parent, a grandparent, a sibiling or anyone who loves a child should be reading with them. The text and art send a beautiful message of how special the child is who is lucky enough to hear this story."
5,Beautiful Book,This book is so beautifully written and the illustrations were fabulous. It is just as much for adults as it is children. Would make a great baby gift.
5,On The Night You Were Born,"A delightful, whimsical book with an affirming message all children should hear. Children will enjoy the beautiful pictures and have fun participating in activities on a couple of pages. I like this book so much that I have already given it to several people with young children."
5,Makes me cry!,"I received this as a baby shower gift.The girl who gave it to me, wrote on the inside...and it is very special to me.I read this to my 5 month old EVERY NIGHT, and i get teary eyed EVERY NIGHT.Great book for babies...but even better for Mommys!!! :)On the night you were born----our lives changed!!"
5,Great Baby shower gift!,I got this for a friend who was having her first baby. She absolutely loved it! I would recommend for first time mothers or for that matter any mother! very sweet book.
5,Beautiful and touching,I bought this one for my best friend`s new baby. It`s a great present to welcome a new child. I love the poem in there and the illustration is gorgeous as well.
5,Sweet little book.,"I love this book. It has beautiful illustrations and a sweet story. I love it more than my 17 month old, but my 3 year old thinks it is a great book too."
2,Uneven follow-up to her excellent debut,"There are some really interesting and unique ideas about magic in this book, but the story is not compelling enough to make this book worthwhile. This book is no where near as good as her first book, Nameless Magery. This book is missing all of the elements of the first book that made it such a great read. There is little humor, the writting is uninspired and characterizations are weak. At times the story was exciting and I could hardly wait to see what happened next and at other times the writing seemed irrelevant. Like Namesless Magery this book also got side-tracked on a romance that came out of the blue and added absolutely nothing to the story. Not recommended unless you were absolutely in love with the first book."
3,Dull and lifeless... yet cheap so I'm not going to complain,"I'll admit it, this book did do some good but most of it was filled with lifeless descriptions and words. As for the kiss that supposedly takes place, it was a snore. If you're still interested in this book, take a moment and consider taking a look at 'Court Duel', quite similar with a more complex and readable plot. (Many thanks to the person who recommended it.)"
1,nothing like her first book,This book was a big disappointment. I read the first book Nameless Magery which was excellent. In this book there were too many characters for good development to take place. There was no explanation about Malka's past or who she was until I was utterly disgusted with the book. It took three attempts at reading it for me to finish it.
1,Swords and Spells?,"Spells, yes there are plenty of them, used to save the main characters when everything else fails. Sheesh, such a dull plot. Trite, simplistic, easy to read, thin, cheap paper. Well, the artwork will look good for another year or two so that's a plus. Don't bother to read this book, there's better ones out there. Like THE BAKER'S BOY or COURT DUEL."
2,"The Book Had Its Moments,But Wasn't Worth What I Paid for It","I bought this book with basically no idea what was inside of it. I had very few expectations. Still, I managed to be disappointed. The main character, Malka, is all right, but the plot itself and the background were a little thin. I must admit, I enjoyed the ending; it made me laugh, but this is not worth buying the book. Most of the characters are slip-shod. Malka was the character who was developed the best, and most of the time, I didn't even like her."
3,So-So,"I thought that NAMELESS MAGERY was delightful. It took all the cliches of fantasy--the princess with powers, having to save the world--and made me adore it, just through the sheer verve of the style. But this one seemed to succumb to the cliches. It took way too long to find out what Malka's problem was. The other characters were shadows, and the humor and verve were missing. The style swerved between tiresomely cryptic and flat. I will still try her next, though; I hope she rushed through this one, and that the third will show the dazzle of the first. I also endorse the other reviewers' recommendations of COURT DUEL but you really ought to read CROWN DUEL first."
1,Junk for sale,I thought this phone holder would do the job with a unique style. Boy was I wrong. This thing isn't worth a nickel. Save your money and keep your phone in your lap.
5,A total must have!,"Talk about a blast from thepast! I thought I would never find this again, let alone on CD! I lost my LPwhen I moved. I still lovethe track ""Foolish Behavior."" Thank God for the internet. This is one album all Rod Stewart fans must have! Take my word for it,BUY IT!"
4,Track listing,"Track listing: Memphis, Sawed Off Shotgun, Blow Wind Blow, Misery, The Day You Walked, All Your Love, Guitar Cha-Cha, Raise Your Window, Time, Trick Bag, I'm On Fire, It Takes Time, Can't Lose What you Ain't Never Had & The Tremble."
2,Lens popped out after second wear.,"My daughter liked the goggles as it matched her swim suit and cap. However, they did not last after her second time using them."
4,"Great Stories, Just not enough","Includes some of the best SF short stories ever written stories, like the award-winning ""The 43 Antarean Dynasties"", ""Seven Views Of Olduvai Gorge"", and ""A little Knowledge"". Also includes many of Mike Resnick's infamous funny short stories. My only complaint, it was too short."
3,"This is not the story that the ""Thing"" was based on!","This is a story set right before and during the American civil war. It is in no way related to ""The Thing""."
1,Much dimmer than expected !,"As others have stated >> this CFL bulb is significantly dimmer than even a 100 watt CFL equivalent bulb. Also, the base of the bulb right above the screw threads is very wide and will not accommodate many lamps built to house a 100 watt incandescent bulb.The saving grace for me is that once I used Amazons automated return function my account was quickly credited. That is a Primary reason I will continue to shop on Amazon ! If something is Not Right they will make it RIGHT ! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!"
3,Globe 0784001 40-Watt Compact Fluorescent Reader Bulb,"Compact fluorescent bulbs (CFB) are a compromise until the prices of LCD bulbs become reasonable. They still have to be disposed of carefully because of their toxic contents; and the light itself is glaring white; and they are bulky.Nonetheless, they have become essential, if only for energy savings. On the principle that all CFB are the same, the Globe bulbs beat their GE competitors on price by a considerable margin. I'll buy them again, if I have to."
1,Piece of junk,"Bought two of these bulbs and they both burned out in less than two months. Sad for me, just after my 30 day return period expired. They are supposed to last several years. Complete junk. Avoid."
4,Very Bright - Also Very Tall,"This bulb is very bright and works great in the garage, but it is also very tall. It may not fit or it may stick up above standard laps/floor laps or other light fixtures."
3,Good lightbulb. Poor packaging.,"Two out of ten of these lightbulbs that I ordered were broken in the packaging. Amazon just threw them in a box and put a bunch of those air bags on top. I had to repackage the broken bulbs and send them back. Pathetic. Oh, by the way, The lightbulbs that weren't broken work very nicely. However, I won't buy lightbulbs from Amazon again."
1,"Globe 0784001 40-Watt Compact Fluorescent Reader Bulb (150-Watt Incandescent Equivalent), Soft White","The product labeling in the advertisement is inconsistent with the labeling on the product itself. It is labeled as ""Globe 0784001 40-Watt Compact Fluorescent Reader Bulb (150-Watt Incandescent Equivalent), Soft White"". Instead, the bulb actually says on it that it is a 15 watt bulb, and on the package it says it is a 40 watt replacement. This means that it is equivalent to an incandescent bulb of 40 watts. It is very dim, and absolutely not what I ordered."
4,A gift for hubby.,"I don't use these. The case doesn't hold items in, but they're good as far as I know. The hubby uses them."
3,It works,This arrived with the plastic casing broken and the bits all over the place. I got this to engrave a piece of marble and it worked. Not professional by any means but a lot cheaper the the hundred dollars it was going to cost me.
3,Great Price.,"I'm not terribly impressed with this set. But I didn't spend a lot. So it is good value for the money. A few of the bits i see having issues. For example, one of the fine tip bits I would ""want"" to use for engraving is bent. So it would just create swirls rather than let me etch fine engravings. Good bang for the buck."
4,cheap but usable,"This are fine bits for limited use in a dremel, cheap is a key word here but fine for most work."
2,Not as advertised,"Product description: ""1/8"" Shank, 2 Class Diamond Titanium Coating"" Product image also suggests this, the ones I received do not have titanium coating."
1,Cheap,Very cheap crap and I will be returning... If possibleIt doesn't cut glass like it should.. Going with better product/brand
4,Great value for the money,Many of the bits are for jobs I may never do. Comes in a nice case for the money. I am happy with the purchase.
3,Not sure how to rate this!,"Broke three bits broke on the first use. Obviously now I know it was not the right product for what I had intended, should have purchase Masonry Drill Bit Set instead. Might still come in handy for some other job so I'll keep it."
5,Excellent value for the price,"Considering how inexpensive this set is, the quality is amazing. I use them to drill and carve beach stones, and they are absolutely perfect. None have broken so far (I've been using them for a few weeks). I'm very pleased with the purchase."
3,Get what you pay for...,"These are not sturdy, and not functional for creating holes in sturdy wood, but for the low price, I guess I will get my money's worth out of them. I was trying to widen a hole in a baseboard that I had made with a drill. I wanted to do this in a cleaner, more precise manner than a drill can allow, so I thought these would do the trick, but they are meant for dainty-er work!"
3,its okay kind of quality,worn out easily... i tried this product for glass etching. It depends on your subject on which you are planning to work on. No suitable for wood.
1,Get what you pay for applies here.,These are a low price item and I found them to be of extremely low quality. the diamond grit wore off fast on the ones that did not break off even faster. I will not buy these again.
3,Ok for the price,These bits break very easily after a couple of uses so be sure to wear eye protection when using these. You get what you pay for though so they work to some extent. It is worth buying higher quality bits if you plan on working on several items.
5,A very good purchase,"Just as described. Meet the expectations of a casual hobbyist. The quality is not the very highest, but the item is priced appropriately. A very good buy overall."
1,Nope.,"Diamond burrs wear off in no time flat. Additionally, FYI, these do not fit in a Dremel Stylus. It was an okay buy for the price, but I wish they had lasted longer than a day."
3,A Fantasy Story for Little Girls,This is a grand story for girls between the ages of 8 and 12; if you have some that fall in that age range and enjoy romantic fantasy this movie is a must see. What one finds here is a mix of Narnia and Lord of the Rings repackaged for little girls. The bad guys are suitably comic and the good guys mix bluster and heroics in a manner that often elicits a chuckle.The movie is long; at 3 hours it takes a lot of time to watch the entire movie. There are two parts and occasional blackouts for commercial breaks which reveal the TV origin of the movie. The movie is lightweight and non-threatening for children but is sufficiently well done to marginally hold the attention of the adult fantasy fan.The little ones may well enjoy it and some of the adults will find it tolerable especially if they are sympathetic to the fantasy genre.
5,LOVED IT !!!,"MY SON REMEMBERED THIS MOVIE FROM WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER, SO I PURCHASED IT FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVED IT AS WELL !!THANKS FOR THE EASY ACCESS TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE.I WOULD MOST LIKEY ORDER ANOTHER MOVIE !!"
4,"Great deal, great buy!","This was a great purchase. The shipping was a bit slow, but it was a heavy item. The only drawback was the absence of a sand wedge, but I just use one from my old set. The bag is nice. The driver and woods are good clubs and the hybrid clubs are good as well. The irons are great. The putter is really heavy, which I happen to like, but the grip and alignment take a little getting used to. Make sure you hit the practice green or mini golf for a good half hour with it to get familiar. Overall, I'm very satisfied."
1,Woods broke on first try!,We played one time with these clubs. Two of the woods broke off and we had to send it back. The rest of the bag and irons were great.
2,Nice light but watchout...,I received 3 of these lights from Amazon. I noticed that one of the lights has wall mounts on the edges of the wallplate. The other 2 have mounts in the center as shown in the picture. The problem is the hardware they include in the box is for center mounting not edge mounting. So in essence it is impossible to mount the odd light with the included hardware. Now that the item is out of stock I have no way of fixing this issue. Nice light but watchout for wrong hardware.

4,Nashville Callin',"It states in the liner notes that ""no exotic plants, animals or organs were used or abused in the production of this project"" and I truly believe that to be true--production-wise, this puppy is as clean as a whistle. Great tunes (all written by Nelda and George Sisk) are the strong suit, but it sure doesn't hurt to have the likes of Doug Jernigan (one of my favorite steel players) and guitarist Shane Theriot on board, either. And is that the same George Sisk (on banjo) who was such a figurehead in the infamous Acidophilus Rangers? Nice stuff all the way around..."
4,Strangers In Paradise - Strangely Entertaining,"Momma Sisko and the other kids may not like that title, but I do. I've heard a lot of singer/songwriter projects over the years, and this one's a real standout.Good, solid writing, outstanding production and a real sense of heart to Nelda Sisk's music herein contained.Buy a copy, and you'll be transported to a Texas Road House, ala The Devil's Backbone Tavern, one of the last two places Hank William (yeah, I know there's no such thing as ""Sr,"" but he was the first one everybody knew) played a paying gig. You can still see the bullet holes in the walls, and you can almost hear Smokey Dacus warming up for a standup drum solo.She can swing that good.And, that's a good thing.In the event it's gone unnoticed, I like this CD. I own one, and I just might buy another."
4,Helpful and recommended,"I recently began looking at the Old Testament with greater vigour.My focus has historically been on the New Testament, as I venture is the case for most Bible reading and studying Christians. Sure, I reference the O.T. when reading the N.T., and spend time in the Psalms and other well-known passages like Isaiah 52 and 53, Daniel, Job, (particularly the first few and final few chapters), Genesis and Exodus, etc. And I read through the O.T. regularly. However studying the O.T. is another thing.I just wanted to advise you laymen out there who have a similar desire to dig in to the other two-thirds of God's Word that this book was a significant help to me. It 'broad-brushed' the issues in such a way as to make it a most enlightening read."
2,How to Ruin Your Own Movie,"Steinbauer ruins his own movie by preventing his subject from discussing anything other than answering generic questions you'd ask your grandfather for a high school English project. ""Where did you grow up? Was your divorce fun?"" You spend three years hunting for a person and you think you'd come up with something better to do with them than aggravate them and waste their time. The scope of the project is impressive though, I suppose. I'm sure gas was a big budget concern. And it's nice to know that this movie gave Jack's book some publicity, because more people need to be aware of the points the man is trying to make. I'd say it's worth seeing, in between the director looking moody for the camera and derailing his own interviews with probing, tactless badgering, there is definitely some interesting content he managed to piece together."
2,Not that funny,"Was expecting something funny, but it was simply a documentary about a sad man who likes to cuss, bully, and intimidate and who thinks he is intellectually superior to every other person out there."
1,NO CAPTIONING!!!!!! ZERO STARS! Thanks for nothing Kino Video!,"Nobody except deaf/hearing impaired people know how disappointing it is to learn of a GREAT film only to find that the distributor choose not to caption/subtitle it for us.I've been waiting for this film to come out for quite a while. Obviously I cannot contain my disappointment!Since this product is completely useless to me, I have to rate it ZERO STARS.Thanks for nothing KINO VIDEO! Your long history of ignoring us ranks you among the TOP 5 useless video distributors.Congrats on this dubious honor."
4,A real sleeper worth watching.,"Wow, what a nice surprise.I'd never seen the Youtube vids. I started it just to see the clips of Jack the Winnebago salesman and yet watched the whole thing and I'm glad I did. Nice ending.Surprisingly touching.Great music.It could have had a little more of Jack and less of Ben (the director). We never get to see Jack's monologue after they're thrown off the Walmart lot. That's a pity. Even the guys at the film festival somewhat waste their time with him. You end up thinking with the audience he's definitely a treasure, and that's a surprise.Definitely worth watching as long as you don't mind the f word.More Jack!..."
5,Awesome book...a must have for every .Net collection.,This book is very well written for any level developer. The layout is very clear and easy to follow. Clear and organized examples. Walks you through latest techniques and abilities of the .Net platform using C#.
4,A Must Read for POL-MIL Professionals,"Gray Ghosts of the Confederacy is an excellent account of the ""fighting"" in and around Missouri during the War Between the States. More importantly, this gem of American history yields insights that foreign policy makers would do well to ponder as American soldiers battle disparate bands of irregular fighters in distant lands today."
3,"The mix as featured in the movie ""American Pie""....","The mix that was featured in the ""strip dance"" sequence is called ""Granny's Epicure Mix"" and is not on this import. Otherwise it is a good dance song but those looking for that particular mix will not find it here."
1,not what i thought,"When I was reading all the reviews everyone was posting, I was expecting something wonderful... when i got it.... thats a different story.. its only 2"" thick and 6.5"" tall, if thats what your into... then great... I wanted something massive, from the other reviews ""its a big as a pop can, i cant wrap my fingers around it, the box weighed 7lbs, exc.."" none of these things happened with me. its probably half the size of a pop can, my fingers go around it, and my thumb can cover my finger of my middle fingernail. now im only 5'4"" so i'm not tall, and i also have pretty tiny hands... thats how not ""HUGE"" this thing really is."
1,Big Brown,"This is a big brown penis, just like a big chocolate Easter bunny. ""Cinnamon"" is a misleading description. Just a brown monotone."
4,not bad,"Let's get the first thing straight. This thing is HUGE. Not excessively long, But pretty thick. Feels pretty realistic compared to a lot of other rubber toys. Suction cup works really well too. The ONLY negative thing about this toy is the rubbery smell that will never go away. Seriously, the smell will never leave. It's not too unbearable, however."
2,Looking for the Real Thing,"I chose this Adam & Eve item because after having used the latex and plastic versions, I was interested in one that was supposed to feel like real flesh. I was diappointed because it feels like all the others I have felt or bought. Plastic, latex...nothing like real flesh. What I can say I liked is, it is really hard, stiff and that is it does not flop when you use the suction, it stand up and stays up....most other flop over.This thing is also hung huge....ladies, this is no average, large...it is a jumbo cock....you must be experience or else insertion is just a dream...."
4,great cd,My little man loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. The CD is great for adults too because it is not overly repetative.
3,Cool for kids,"My 8 month old son LOVES the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse show, so I bought him this CD to keep him happy in the car. It does keep him quiet and the Clubhouse & Hot Dog songs are the ones from the show. However, some of the character's voices might put your nerves on edge (like Donald singing ""Daisy""), which is why I gave it three stars."
5,My lil Monkey loved it!,Got this for my Grandson who loves MM club house. He knew words to some of the sounds and enjoyed hearing the tunes! Sound was clear and def worth the purchase!
4,ANOTHER BBC COMEDY GEM,THIS IS THE FIRST SERIES [APPROX. 180 MINUTES] OF THE LONG RUNNING BBC HIT COMEDY FROM THE 90'S. TWO SISTERS ARE LIVING TOGETHER IN THE SAME MANSION-LIKE HOME TRYING TO COPE WITH LIFE AFTER THEIR HUSBANDS ARE SENT TO JAIL. THEY DEAL WITH EVERYDAY PROBLEMS INCLUDING THE SEXUAL EXCESSES OF THEIR MAN-HUNGRY NEIGHBOR. A CLASSIC COMEDY
4,Decent Item,"I got this in the other day, and I am overall fairly pleased with it. It's decently sized, not too big, not too small. It has a filter which is very nice. The lid locking is a little difficult. It doesn't seem to want to lock completely. The only real problem I had with this, is that I was under the impression that it had a door on the front of it. It doesn't, although I can see prongs to attach one. I suppose I could go and try to find a litter pan door myself, which I assume will be difficult. It just would have been nice to have seen it in black and white that it did not in fact have a door on it. I would not have bought it in the first place."
3,OK product for a SMALL cat,"Really like the colors of the box. Unfortunately I did not read reviews. This is no way big enough for an average size cat. Also, gave rating of 3, because lid is very difficult."
2,| Lid Lock Broke Immediately |,"The title of my review says it all. It's smaller than I thought. My cat is too big for it, but that is not the primary issue as I could have paid closer attention to the dimensions. The latch to keep the lid in place broke within the first hour of receiving this item."
2,NOT PINK!!!!!,"I know it says its pink, but it isnt. Its blue & its not Jumbo its large. I would return it but its too much of a hassel...."
2,Poor lid design,Overall construction was good and size and color were as expected. If you are counting on using a generic litter liner you will have a hard time finding one to fit. Also the lid is supposed to fit on securely but it very difficult to fit on and when you think it seems secure it still comes apart . You definitely cannot lift it by the top handle. Unless my paricular box is defective I would not recommend it for sturdiness. However I still use it and cats seem to like it ok. Next time I would find one with snap down latches on the side.
1,lid won't latch...,I tried everyhting to get the lid to latch but nothing ......not good if you have a cat that likes to tear up the litter pan just trying to cover up her scent etc....had to throw it out and get a better one at walmart
2,It seems seller can't be contacted!,"Indeed the locking mechanism does not work, doesn't stay in place so you can't pick up the box..making the handle useless? I can't find the option to contact seller. I would like to ask about those preset holes, wondering if there's something we can put in there to lock top to bottom like the traditional hooded boxes have.As for size, its average."
3,"Good price, not great quality","The plastic really absorbs smell, so it's sort of stinky. And the latches on the sides don't really work. But it was cheap and was delivered to my door, so I can't complain too much!"
1,TOO small of a litter pan,"All my cats are large sized and they had a very hard time getting in and out of the litter pan. The hood is hard to get on and off for cleaning. It is only for small cats, kittens or maybe ferrets too. The price isn't bad, only if your buying it for a small cat or kitten.The color is wrong, it's a dark pink pan with a light pink hood.Looks big, but isn't.I was very disappointed about it."
3,Not as large as it looks,"Litter box pretty much works as expected. It is just smaller than I expected, definitely not a 'large' so check the dimensions carefully before you order."
1,Piece of garbage,This toy has nothing to do with Lionel and it shows. The toy is cheap and the wheels came off within 2 days and are a choking hazard. There are cheaper toys trains that work better.
4,Tasty shenanigans from Pamplemousse again!,"Although not my favorite of the Pamplemousse series, this new work by Bond was highly entertaining, some parts hilarious! A plus is that the dog Pommes Frites was featured alot in this caper, the downside being that near the end I slightly lost track of what was going on. The food somehow was not as tasty as usual, though I have learned a great deal about escargots! Nevertheless, the now familiar sexual hijinks, and mistaken indentities make Pamplemousse's ""cruise"" excellent light weekend reading."
1,Slipknot Shirt - Better ones are out there,This shirt shrank a ridiculous amount with one wash. I will not buy this brand again.
2,Not her best,"As an avid reader, this is not one of Luanne Rice better books. I have read almost all of her books and after looking forward to this one, I was disappointed.I hope her next book is more interesting and less melodrama.In my reviews I do not write about the plot of the book. I leave that to the editors. It upsets me to see someone writting half the story of the book in a review.This is just my opinion. Have a great day......"
1,Sandcastles,"Very slow, boring. I couldn't get into it at all and quit reading it after a few chapters. I gave it to a friend and she did the same."
3,Sandcastles,"I felt the book ""Sandcastles"" was just in ""the middle of the road"" falling more to the down side. You can see by my vote of 3 stars on this review. To me it had no intense drama or plot. It just seemed too repetitous and predictable."
3,Sandcastles wash away quickly and does your interest in this book.,"This is a difficult story to finish. There are so many words bolded in this book that it detracts from the story and is very distracting and annoying. There are also numerous typos found throughout the story which makes for difficult reading. The many ""coincidences"" and ""visions"" found throughout the book make this story seem too incredible to believe. This is not one of Ms. Rice's better novels. Even the ending was weak, predictable, and disappointing."
1,Ill conceived and poorly written,"Although I read a number of books, I do not typically submit book reviews; but this book was so poorly written that I felt compelled to comment. There is no need to repeat all of the negative comments from other reviewers, but they all are very accurate. The characters are poorly developed--not ""real"" people. Could Tom and Bernie possibly have had the same conversation several times a day every day for the past 23 years? Each character was on the brink of emotional meltdown at all times throughout the entire book; and the metaphors used to describe their emotional state were overworked in the extreme. This was my first Luanne Rice book, and it will, without question, be the last."
2,"I love Luanne Rice, But...",I just didn't love this book. I was so bored. The story seemed drawn out and so predictable. I pretty much knew what was going to happen before the end of the first few chapters.
1,BORING! Amateurish...,"Very boring and written like a senior in high school. Or worse. If this book can get published, a lot of people may have a shot of writing a book! Could not finish the book, stopped after reading the 3rd chapter. Pretty dumb storyline!"
1,Can`t use this in Norway,"This can`t be used in Norway... Trash to me, because of the electic 110. We use 220 V. I really wanted one like this"
1,OK for brief emergency use,"I thought it might be handy as a small space unit, but it's too small, too lightweight, and more like a toy than something you might use over and over again for a longer period of time. I simply was wrong about it and didn't imagine it would be so flimsy and difficult to keep clean."
3,Toaster Oven,You get what you pay for ... !9.95 .... It is ok for a small toaster oven. I wish the rack slide out when you open the door. It is hard to get the food out.
3,Gets the job done.. barely,"I ordered this for the company lunch room where I work. We just needed something compact and functional.Others complained about the size, but it's a two slice toaster, what do you expect?It was exactly what I envisioned in that aspect.As far as quality.. Not so much. The main purpose was to warm up or toast small home made sandwiches. It takes FOREVER. Even turning it all the way up, it's taking at least 15 minutes for this use. For those of us that take only half hour lunches, it's frustrating and useless.The main thing is, I'd have gotten one for the same price at WalMart if I'd known. If it were half the price of a functional one, I wouldn't have cared about the lower quality. When this one burns out, I wouldn't buy another. I don't recommend."
3,Elite Toaster Oven,this toaster oven works well. the only thing I could say is a negative the size is alot smaller than it looked on the internet. but for the price itspretty good.
3,"OK, but not great","I bought this because it was the smallest toaster oven I could find. It meets that requirement. It works OK as a top broiler or toaster oven, but is somewhat uneven for plain toast. I guess that is why toasters are sold."
1,Timer is loud and you can't shut it off early!,"I wanted to replace our slice toaster with a toaster oven - as soon as this arrived i took it out of the box and tested it, only to find that the timer is SUPER loud and annoying, and once you set it, you can't turn it off until it winds all the way down. You can turn off the toast/bake function, but it still goes 'TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK..."" until it winds down. Really annoying. I am returning it, but now I have to pay the return shipping. Ugh."
5,A toaster,"All i wanted was some thing to toast my bread and I like cheese toast so instead of another toaster I ordered this. I dose a great job. You should know that when you set the times you cannot stop it so if you set to toast and set your timer for to long you have to turn off the toast setting and let the timer tick down. Not a real problem, if you leave toaster nob on on a setting the coils will continue to heat.All in all a great little no bells and whistles toaster."
5,Over and over again,"The Alien series is one of those rare movies that I can enjoy time after time. This set is a great collection. It's inexpensive, chock full of extras, and comes in cool packaging. A great buy for anyone who loves the films, Sigourney Weaver, or Sci-Fi."
1,WARNING=BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!,"I am a HUGE fan of the Alien series and was greatly anticipating this set. I've viewed most of the disks, and of the ones that played for me, I was greatly impressed. The content seems unsurpassed. HOWEVER, I went through two sets with Amazon and had to return both due to scratches on the disks and disks that would not play (even without scratches). I have one of the latest state-of-the-art DVD players, so it can't be my machine.Even if the unscratched disks played normally, there is still the major issue of badly scratched disks and a digi pak liner that pops out and is sharp enough to badly scratch disks if they are not carefully replaced. I am either waiting the inevitable ""fix"" that will come to this set, or may buy the disks individually. I realize many people are getting good sets, but my luck brought me two scratched ones. Buy at your own risk!"
5,Excellent,We got it on time and was as descibed! We are very pleased. My husband and I love the alien movies along with the predator movies so we are extremely thrilled with this purchase.
5,It is classic!,Love the series! Just bought Prometheus! Never been disappointed in any movie! A must have for the true fan! Ripley is the best!
5,"""Game over man! Game over!""",Great movies! The collection is so much better when you watch them all together. Spent a freezing Saturday watching them all and enjoyed every minute.
4,The Ultimate Boxset? I would say yes...,"Firstly, I'm a big fan of ""ALIEN"". What Ridley Scott did was superb. What James Cameron did was incredible. What David Finch did was a dissapointment. What Jean Pierre did was average.But when it comes to this Quadrilogy boxset, I believe its enough even the last 2 movies were bad, its good to own the entire collection.What more you want for that kind of price with 9 DVDs, almost 50 hours of extras, contents you'll never expect to see. And most of all, the extras, deleted/extended scenes, alternate scenes and trailers, galleries and all the cool stuff and the evolution of all four Alien movies.This is one boxset to own if you're a fan, and its one boxset I believe you will enjoy as many times as you want to."
5,Great set!,"I have been wanting to purchase all of these movies for a long time but it would have cost me a fortune to get them separately from a store. I was very glad to find the whole set, in mint condition, for such a reasonable price. I was having trouble finding them all to begin with so that was a big bonus as well."
5,Best science fiction quadrilogy of all time,"The Alien Quadrilogy is absolutely the best science fiction quadrilogy of all time. The combined set covers every aspect of a superb sci fi that one would expect--science fiction based on existing and projected sci fi realities about space travel, space ship design, space travel, future technology, the intrigue and mystery of unknown planets and other life forms, some horror, excellent drama, and a well edited film, with superior directing and superior acting. The set includes not four, but nine DVD's, four of which cover two versions of the movies--original and director's cut; and the other five covering the making of the movies, including interviews with the actors--sometimes a few humorous and enlightening moments during the filming. This quadrilogy is a classic, and can serve as a science fiction course on the college level."
3,Alien Movies - Languages,The first 3 movies are in english or spanish with subtitles in either language. This works fine for me since not everyone in my household speaks english. But the last movie is in english or french with subtitles only in english. I don't know if this was a mistake or that is the way they made it. I'd like to think it was a mistake.
5,9 disks,Everything you wanted to know and see for the 4 Alien Movies a cinamatic adventure on every disk
1,Discs are damaged,"This would be a really great set if the discs were not damaged--they really should do a recall. Like many others apparently, I started watching the first disc only to have it start skipping badly about 1hr. in. I figured it was just a little smudge or dust on the disc & was horrified to see that there were large scuffs on the DVD. I examined a couple others and found damage to them as well.Go with the individual 2-disc releases; I've heard they don't have these quality control issues."
3,Now that's a Big Box Set,"I work at a video store and was reading a review of this box set. Get ready to be amazed people because this box set is designed to unfold in a way similar to how the Buffy box sets unfold. When completely unfolded it reaches a little over five feet long. Make sure when opening that you have a nice large table cleared. I mean o.k. Buffy sets are six discs and even that's a little absurd, but five feet? I really don't understand how this is going to work. Anyway we all know that it's a great series with some of the movies being better than others. My personal favorite is Aliens because that's the one I saw as a little kid and remember the best. Oh well, Happy Unfolding."
5,sci fi addict,"If you like sci fi and horror type movies, this group has it all. A really nice collection, at an attractive price."
5,Great Collection For Alien Lovers!,"This is the definitive collection for the Alien series. It comes with all four dvds, and each is packed with bonus feature. Every disc comes with a bonus disc with all the features you'll ever need. A MUST HAVE!"
4,Pat73,"Now this is more like it--really good movies, well acted, with the most terrifying horror characterizations to ever be put on film. A delightful mind blower. Pat 73"
5,Great classics,The product is great for fans or anybody who wants to see the Alien series and never have. It is more for fans unless u want to see the extra content on each additional disc. They are worth the price and are great for anyone who like's to but older movies for there collection.
5,Right on fox!!,"Fox has outdid themselves with this box set possibly creating the best set to date. I have been waiting for the extended version of alien for a very long time and also for an extended version of alien 3 the other two I don't really care about. I think this is what to expect the star wars trilogy to be like, If not a better box set, although it will be hard to top this one. Highly recomended!!"
3,Alien Quadrilogy,"came to me with some of the dvd's not in there place holders, with minor scratches but still viewble."
1,just cancelled my order,"this seller is the worse. on december 22nd... 12 days after i placed my order for a christmas present, they cancel my order at the last possible moment and thats that... ridiculous. definitely order at your own risk!"
1,"the movies are pretty good as always, but...",The quality is very bad.I bought this set and the discs were scratch and the spanish subtitles didn't exist (???)Finally I returned it.The Alien Legacy is better than this showy edition.
4,Is it occuring to anyone...?,"Firstly, and I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but again, ""quadrilogy"" is not an acceptable word, because (check your dictionaries folks), it ain't a word. They could give the American populus a little more credit and call it Alien Tetralogy, as opposed to going with the George Bush word, ala, ""Misunderestimated."" We know what you mean pal, but it's not a word.Secondly, is it occuring to anyone else that Alien3 and Ressurection weren't good? At all? Or at least, compared to the first two? Okay, okay, so they're sprucing up all the movies. Release them individually, you think? Or don't make me pay 70 bucks (and that's discounted) for two movies I'm not going to watch? I mean, that's not occuring to anyone else? I KNOW I'm not the only one who feels the same way about this."
5,Why Buy This Online?,"I dont quite understand why the price of this box set is over 100 dollars .. you could go buy this at your neighbourhood Zellers, Wallmart, any store that sells DVD's for anywhere from $84.99 to $89.99 before tax. so amazon please explain why you have your units so overpriced?????"
2,If this isn't enough what is?,A DTS track on Aliens and Alien 3 for starters. The DTS tracks were one of the most important things I was hoping enjoy with this set. Without them is a major disappointment and knocks this title off my reference list.
5,This will be THE set to have.,"Alright, I've been doing alot of reading about this set through discussion forums and online reviews (a good one at thedigitalbits.com) and I have to comment on people who are knocking this set already.1. The packaging - okay so it folds out to over 5 feet when completely unfolded. So what! You are not going to fold it out both ways anyway. If you really care that much be creative and come up with your own solution and store the foldout somewhere.2. The 30 minute cut of Alien3 features - So there was a 30 minute cut of the features on Alien3 and now some people aren't happy. You guys need to get a life. 98% of the population doesn't care including myself. There are plenty of other features to keep you busy.$70 is a steal for this set and you all should be thankful that such a thorough set is being released. Count your blessings folks, this is one set that will be hard to imitate."
5,Blu-Ray please,"I loved all of the films, but i really do hope they come out with a Blu-Ray format and even an extended version would also help. I haven't bought this product (DVD) because i'm waiting for the Blu-Ray version. thanks"
3,crap packaging,"i love the movies, but the packaging is some of the worst i have ever come across. the plastic trays that hold to the cardboard foldout have already started to pop off completely. there is a serious issue with the quality in the packaging. why did they do so poorly on this. i'm very disappointed. i wish i would have waited to purchase the discs separately. i am now stuck with a box set that is a real pain in the ass to fold out (it's five feet long folded out, and is one of the msot awkward box sets to get into.) and after 2 days of having the box, the trays are already popping off completely. i've had to superglue them back on myself. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. don't bother with this box set."
5,Awesome set,"If you like the Alien saga, these are an excellent set. The movies are exciting although there is a drop-off in quality for one or two (i.e. Alien 3). This set is in a beautiful case, highly recommend."
3,Blu Ray,Is the Alien Quadrilogy and the Alien Anthology the same thing?I know they have Anthology on blu ray but I always heard something about Quadrilogy was better.Anyone know?Thanks a lot.Chuck
3,"defective discs, even in Japan",I love my box set...but the DTS track on the first movie is messed up in several places. I bought this box set in Japan thinking it might be spared the problems the USA discs were having..wrong!
2,No need to have all 4,"Only the first one is really worth watching, and maybe the second. The third we liked so little that we haven't even watched the 4th yet."
5,Alien Quadrilogy,"I purchased this for my husband's birthday, and he is very satisfied with the collection. It's even better than he thought it would be."
4,great horror quadrilogy,"Alien sequels were as good as the original. Sigourney Weaver is fabulous, perfect for this role. This is very good series of this genre. This genre is not my favorite but this is my favorite of the genre. Great CGI, very good script and cast. Very good direction by Ridley Scott and James Cameron. For horror buffs this is definitely 5 stars"
5,satisfied,"bought this for my brother and he loves it, he couldn't wait for it to arrive, came in great shape and condition. Thank you!"
3,Never put the first two gems with the last two stinkers,The first two films were two of the best SF action movies of the last 30 years. The following films stunk beyond all description.The thread was broken when the third film spit in the faces of every ardent fan of the first two movies by opening with killing off three survivors of the epic second movie. Ripley might as well as have cut her own throat as endure the hardship and challenges she endured to save Newt in the second film.I have marked the directors of these abominations and will avoid them for all time.
1,I little overkill i believe,"I love the Alien movies as much as the next person,but when is enough,enough.I mean come on do we REALLY need 9 discs to show how good these movies are?Who in the world doesnt have that much of a life to sit and watch hours of worthless extra features?Some outtakes,maybe one featurrete,few deleted scenes fine,leave it at that.I mean do we really care about screenplay's,screentests,commentaries,etc?Geez can we say Greed anyone.Just get the other smaller box set.Don't waste money."
5,Bursting with value!,"Only $22 for both theatrical and special edition/director's cut versions of each movie. that's only $2.75 per version. The box is one of those unwieldy cardboard/plastic fold-out deals, and with 9 discs the thing is 5ft 4in long when fully opened! Comes with a nice booklet detailing each version."
4,The Alien Series is great,"If Alien Resurrection had never been made I would give it 5 stars. However, that abomination of a film ends the series. Dont watch it, it will make you cry for the humanity."
5,completely out of this world..,"Even the packaging itself is beyond belief. It's not an extended special, or the ultimate edition. With a big underestimation, it is THE SUBLIME edition. Having heard that the UK copy has some ""corrections"", this is the only version to get satisfied. It surely sets a bold new standard for any upcoming dvd set. Very highly recommended!"
3,"Great for a researcher, but watch out","First off, it is good to have all this material together in one place and many theses, dissertations, and books on the series will probably be written in short order. Everyone else has already covered the issue of the innane title, so I'll skip that and go right to the real issue: much of the material with the DVDs is just as innane and often innacurate, such as the fact that several of the character names are mixed up in the Alien3 booklet (Holt McCallany plays Junior and not Christopher John Fields) now forever confusing an issue many of us have been trying for yeras to straighten out. This sort of slap-dash glitz with no real searious research (or proofreading) is inexcusable and has the potential to really ruin a valuable tool for film and SF researchers. I suppose I'll spend the next few years comparing the DVD collection to all the material I already have (which is most of it) and waiting nervously for the next mistake, and the next one, and the next . . ."
5,Fantastic,"This is the Ultimate DVD box set for any Alien or Sci-fi fan. The movie quality is supurb and the bonus features offer wonderful insight, literally hours of extras.Alien and Aliens were the best of the series, very scary not just shock and awe but also psycologically disturbing. Alien 3 and Alien Ressurection are weaker but still very entertaining.This is a must have. Just don't see them alone in the dark!"
3,Packaging sucks,"I love the movies. I hated the layout of this case. It keeps going and going and going. It's not practical and a pain in my arse. If you have so many discs, you should not keep folding. Just a thought."
2,Aliens Quadrilogy Purchase,I haved played a number of the disks. Some skips on a few. Overall the price was good but quality is still suspect.
5,Alien Quad,This product is awesome if you're into the Alien movies. The director cuts add to the suspense of the storylines. The price was unbeatable and delivery was earlier than stated. A must-have for true fans!
5,Im Australian,"I collected the Alien Quad in 3 versions: US, AUS, and UK. The US is superior in many ways, but did anyone notice you can't view the artwork and original drafts on the AUS and UK versions? maybe its my remote??If so, let me know and email me on taylor5821@hotmail.com"
5,Alien Quadrilogy,This is a fantastic package. All the movies and extras on 9 discs in a nice little box. The price was perfect and I got free shipping to boot. I suggested this to two of my friends and they bought it as well.
5,A fan must have!,"I've always been fan of the Alien series and I wanted to have them all in one package, and this set box is great. The 9 discs are worth the price and you can get to see other versions not previously seen, which are excellent and give you a different perspective. Only the first one has no major changes, maybe a few extended scenes, but the rest of them are amazing! My favorite so far is ""Alien Resurrection"", when we get to see a glimpse of earth after soooo many years and Ripley is finally home. Get it ONLY if you're a true fan, otherwise..."
2,1.85 Anamorphic for Alien?,"The film was released at 2.35:1, and the previous DVD release kept the original aspect ratio. Since all the other films in this box set keep the OAR of the other films, why change Alien? Can't say I'm particularly excited by this as alien 3 and Alien Resurrection sucked. I might buy Aliens, but I'm certainly not going to blow $70 for the one or two films I care about. JMO. --M"
2,The Final (and we promise this time) END ALL BE ALL ALIENDVD,"The tiring thing for those of us who are sick of shelling out money for ""Directors Cut Special Edition DVD's"" is when they pull this crap. While Alien Quad. is no doubt glorious and contains every scrap of info ever filmed concerning my favorite sci fi series, i can't help but feeling cheated. I bought a $100 4-DVD set last year that was packaged like your average collectors item DVD set: nice pseudo-embossed silver-on-black box, and the ""Directors Cut"" of Aliens (read: Laser Disc edition)which is my favorite of the 4 movies. Now I am reading in an ""official"" PR release for Quad that this is th ""first time on DVD that Aliens special edition has been released."" Bull! Its been out for a couple of years. This repackaging and reselling crap has got to stop! Studios need to release ONE end-all be-all directors cut/special edition/collectors edition and STICK WITH IT!!!!"
2,Alien Series,"The only one I really loved and bought was Aliens, though I liked the 1st movie alot, it kind of draged in places. I didn't like Aliens III or IV"
2,good movies but a little pricy and kind of blatent,"well first of Amazon rules shopping worldwide for prices and quality but this set could be alot cheeper than even 85.99, it's only 4 movies with alternate versions which i dought are much different if at all so i don't see the point here in this set, makin a dollar i guess..."
1,Very Unpleased,A year ago i bought the Alien Legacy i was very pleased with all of the deleted sences and options.....but im disappointed in seeing them come out with another boxed set with the deleted sences already in the film....i wasted 80 bucks for nothing....i should of waited....i kinda think some alien fans might not buy this new set...what a good way to get an extra buck....very disappointed.
1,Not received,"I'm sorry to tell you that I haven't reveived the Alien Quadrilogy yet, It's now about five weeks since I ordered it. Could you tell me when it will arrive?Kjell Einar Erstad"
4,The Best of The Best,When i first saw alien i was like 9 of 10. even tho they dont show the full alien till the end of the movie it was the best Sci Fi movie i had ever seen. then i got stupid (kinda) and saw Alien Ressurect and said it was even better but 3 yeras ago i saw the error in my ways. so i went on and saw Alien 3. This was really cool and explained alot about 4. Then finaly i saw Aliens which is the best in my opinion. I went back and watched all of then over again 3 years ago and watched Alens again befor AVP. They all still rock and i go back to 4 hoping it got better to me but still nothing. The is truly what an alien freak like me needed. There needs to be a 5th film and a precule to all these films.
1,Warning: compression problems,"Warning for potential buyers... the cd of Alien 4 is full of compression errors and won't even play on my dvd player. I managed to start the movie by scene jumping, but halfway through on a scene jump the movie stalled, dumping me into a ""dvd video compression"" screen, and I could not access anything beyond this point.I don't know if I have a defective cd or if there are scores of compression problems with this product.Caveat emptor."
3,Small.,I did not realize the desk would be so small. I hope it fits my stepdaughter. The assembly is easy. The rolltop itself has a huge tendency to stick.
2,"Desk okay, shipping slow and messy","This desk requires a lot of assembly. The lap drawer stop does not fit, if you want to put the back board up, you will need to customize it. I oredered it with expedited shipping (1-3 days), paid a lot for it, and the item arrived 5-7 days later. I have not been refunded the shipping. The desk is most appropriate for children 5 our above."
2,THIS is historical fiction!,"&#65279; When I first sat down to ""Captive Heart"" I was ready to curl up with what I had been told was an excellent romantic/historical fiction novel. How misguided I was! Within the first page I was ready to put the book down. Ms. Chaikin had made the almost unforgivable blunder of referring to Devora's underskirts as ""crinolines"". Unless I am grievously mistaken, this book is set in the year 1661, a full two hundred years before the crinoline ever entered the fashion scene! Furthermore, as I read on I couldn't help but get the sensation that Ms. Chaikin was trying overly hard to write in what could be called a ""lyrical, romantic style"", the effect was nauseating. In conclusion, I must state, that if Ms. Chaikin plans to continue her historical fiction writing, she'd better do some more research."
5,Loved it!,"Just like all of Linda Chaikin's books this one is a great story. Devora is being sent away from the life she has always known to marry a man that she has never met and has no interest in. She wants to get out of it any way possible and return to her uncle Barnabas in Bridgetown, Barbados where she could help him with his patients and marry the man she believed would be the perfect husband for her. While she waited in Spain to meet the man she was supposed to marry, she got caught up in a situation with Pirates. She was being drawn to the well known Captain Bruce Hawkins even though she didn't want to admit it to herself. I think Linda's writings are all really great! This is just another of those examples."
1,A manual of inaccuracies,"This seems to be a hastily written book, which may be described as a real ""manual of inaccuracies"". To cite only a few (I spotted dozens of them): ""the Basque Provinces of Asturias, Galicia, Catalonia and Valencia"" (no comments! ); ""Chili does mean hot pepper in Spanish"" (chilli is a nahua word, spelled in Spanish ""chile""); ""The Quichua language was spoken by Indians in western Guatemala..."" (actually, the Quiché language, while Quechua - and not Quichua - is the language spoken in the Andean region); ""New York appears as Nueva York on a Brazilian world map"" (this is the Spanish name for NY, not the Portuguese Nova York). This book is not more than a shameless attempt to make money."
2,"Interesting, but Jumbled","Interesting facts throughout, however, the book jumps all over the map (so to speak) and back and forth through history. It was difficult to follow the train of thought sometimes. He also puts forth an idea of pictures instead of place names about half way through the book, then proceeds to talk about it sparingly in the chapter. Interesting facts, but not well organized."
2,Fun but disappointing,"I wondered when I read this book just how accurate it was. It is a huge area of information to cover and the author while writing well does seem to have made some annoying errors. The other reviews cover many of them it seems (a lot I didn't know in fact) The one I picked up is that, when naming the Apollo 13 captain, Nelson called him James Loving (his name is, in fact, James Lovell). Its kind of really basic mistakes like that which bother me. It shouldn't be that hard to get an editor who can pick up on the slip-ups an author makes.Although Nelson has divided his book up into 11 chapters they do tend to overlap a lot in subject area and matter. It is a fun easy read, one of those books with lots of little snippets of information which makes it easy to pick up at virtually any stage. However in the end I think a book needs to be both fun and accurate."
3,A decent zombie movie,"The Child is a zombie movie, although not a ""great"" one. A city-girl returns to the countryside where she grew up to be a nanny for a little girl who has been very awful since her mother died. But as the nanny falls in love with a man working at the house, the girl gets angry. The girl has control of zombies from the nearby cemetary, and she uses them to strike back at everyone around her.This disk is very good, as well. It contains trailers for many other movies, and it has a ""short"" movie (which is about 70 minutes, I believe), that also has zombies in it (that movie is older, and there is very little gore, since the zombies are basically used as cheap workers, as in most older zombie movies).Excluding several scenes, this one is not as graphic as most zombie movies, but still is gory enough that some people may want to avoid it."
3,Good Countersink,"This is a nice set and it comes with 7 pilot bits, 7 countersinks and 7 colars w/ allen wrench.Works exactly as intended and arrived before schedule date."
2,One was broken,"I guess they work okay, but when one-sixth or more of your product is useless, it really isn't a good value at any price."
4,Seem fine UPDATE 12/08,"I can't write a complete review because I don't know how these will last. Mine arrived in perfect condition and, at a couple dollars, they were worth the price. If they last for six months, I'll be happy.UPDATE-- These have worked extremely well, still bright after all these months. I've had no problems and would buy them again."
3,Ken Ishii - Echo Exit,"Ken Ishii's final single from his _Jelly Tones_ album is ""Echo Exit,"" a slice of tech with a good dose of guitar. Mekon, not surprisingly, go for a big beat sound (but slowed down) for their mix, while Silver City amp up the guitars for their more traditional big beat mix (the Boom Boom Satellites also go for the big beat sound, but in a more stripped down way). Hoax piles on the atmospheric drum 'n' bass, and Jerome Verheij return the track to proper 4/4 techno, even if it's less frenetic than the original."
4,not the same song..but a good one,"i have the album boys for pele and i don't like the song professional widow at all. so i ignored the import single when i saw it in the store. but then i saw the video for the remix version, ""its got to be big"" and i was like hey that sounds like a cool song. i didn't even realize it was supposed to be professional widow. after buying the CD, i don't think the song is anything like professional widow, but its a fun song. the single was pretty expensive, but tori's worth it. i love tori's ""girl and piano"" thing, but some club beats and dance/tecno style tori is awesome too! four starz"
5,Excellent Delphi book,This is an excellent Delphi learning & reference manual. I am finding it to be a great asset to my programming books.
1,Not for beginners!,"Stay away from this book if you're new to the Delphi programming language. All the introductory material that appeared in previous editions has been excised. The book dives right into advanced coding concepts and useful tips for the experienced Delphi programmer.I bought this book based on the assumption that it would provide a thorough grounding in the fundamental mechanics of Delphi development. I was sorely disappointed and instead have ordered Learn Delphi 4 in 21 Days which should be geared more toward beginning Delphi programmers.You can visit the author's website and download his Essentials of Object Pascal book in pdf format. I did, but found it confusing, incoherent and utterly useless."
3,"Great book, a little exhausting.","This book is more of the reference type, not one you should try reading page by page as a tutorial. If that is what you are looking for, I recommend any beginner to check out 'Delphi in a Nutshell' , by O'reilly. Mastering Delphi 7 seemed to perfectly explain the IDE(Integrated Devlopment Enviornment), but over a course of about 800 pages. I dont think that the Delphi programming language was discussed enough in this book, it was more like a in depth way of explaining every feature of Delphi 7, the program."
5,Review of my last buy,"I received a splendid book as new as i expected...I did not think to be so lucky, i thought to receive an old and ruined book but I received an almost new instead.thanks all of you."
4,Great Product,What a wonderful group and CD. My mom purchased it last year and I just had to have it for myself this year. You can't go wrong with anything that Voice Male puts out. the songs are so fun.
4,Great for the budding scientist!,"My mother-in-law sent this for my son this Christmas and it is such a hit. Definitely a toy for the thinking child. My son is 9 and although I do have to minorly assist him, he is absorbing everything. Products used in the experiments are replaceable with common household items--such a plus for us because once is never enough. This product seems extremely durable, too, with holders for all the tubes, beakers, etc. I did see that the guide was age-inappropriate (i.e. Why does my child need to know that so-and-so was an exotic dancer before coming on the squad?), so I had to give it an overall 4. I hate to do that, but this is a toy."
4,Happy with product,"This is a great project and was well worth the money for the future scientist, but definately needs supervision and the supply box leaks so be careful where you store it."
3,Mixed results,"The beginning, basic level experiments in this lab work fine. However, as you get further into the more advanced experiments, you find out the equipment provided is substandard. We purchased this lab specifically for the electrophoresis chamber and centrifuge. Neither worked well. We have contacted the manufacturer, asking for suggestions on improving the use of this lab. They have not bothered to reply to our e-mails. I will not purchase any more items by Planet Toys."
3,a fairly good rendition of Danny Kaye's original recording.,"I would recommend it if you really loved the original movie..however, it still lacks the talent of Danny Kaye and Louie Armstrong. I wish the song, ""The Five Pennies"" had been recorded slower as it was in the original soundtrack."
2,Not sure this is as special as it's billed,"I have had this for a while now, an still have yet to be in a situation where I could use this a lot. I find that Parafilm-M and Tamiya tape work just as well as any situation you would need this for. It's ok, but not the ""must have"" item it was billed as."
2,"""Plain"" doesn't begin to describe it","I admit, this is my first Belva Plain book and possibly my last, but since a good friend loaned it to me, I gave it a try. The storyline on the cover didn't appeal to me, bigotry and hate divided two families. Okay. The characters seem shallow and confused in their own lives and then pass that confusion on. Tom is a boy so dedicated to his younger brother Timmy and his girlfriend Robbie, but only bends to his mother's wishes out of sympathy and pity for her. His father is a domineering man who pushes Tom to follow in the beliefs of his dad while belittleing his mother. The Crawfields seem like good people and they seem like the most honest characters in the book.Overall, not a book I'd recommend."
4,Exciting.,"I haven't finished it yet,but what I've read so far is good, so good that I don't want to put it down. It's both exciting and emotional at the same time. This book is for anyone who likes that type of stuff."
1,"Lame, Don't waste your time!","Poorly written, characters that you couldn't care less about, weak plot that is so unbelievable it's not even entertaining--read anything but this book! Not worth the paper it's written on."
4,Impeller for Rio 2100 (TAAM),I think do to the cost of new pumps buying these propellers is the cheapest way to go. They work well for a while until enough debris wears the propellers down or they break. if you get sand around the magnet the pumps gets trashed quickly. You just have to take care on there use. maintanience is a must to mantain these impellers. I like the ceramic shaft but then they break easily even though there isn't and corrosion. They are about half the cost of a new pump. I these because they are the best I can get on the market for the money. Still looking around for a better product.
4,ok....but one problem,"This movie was good.But one problem.It skips about half way into the movie. Other than that...it's ok.But I must warn you though,I did not buy this movie on amazon.com.I bought this movie elsewhere so this movie might be different here.So anyway about the movie.It's really cool..half of it is mummies and the other half is zombies!I would reccomend this to any fan offclassic horror movies."
5,Splashing good time!,"The Firehouse gang is clearly having a lot of fun playing a mix of ""sea-related"" songs. Fun and, as always, well played."
1,not what I expected,"The book has a ton of shark teeth but I couldn't get around the grammatical errors, misspelled words and low resolution graphics. This book would be nice if it had been edited and the images didn't look like they were copied from the web."
4,Good to finish the collection!,"I am an ""I Love Lucy"" fan through and through. I owned all the seasons prior to this one and was very thrilled to see this collection released. Although it is called ""Season 7-9"", it should really be called ""Season 7."" There are 4 discs with only about 3 episodes on each. There are very few DVD extras. However, there was one interesting peek into what it was like to be in the audience. A viewer secretly taped a few shots of the on set recording of ""The Audition."" It was only a few scenes, but still exciting to watch. I wish there were more extras like the ones on the previous seasons' boxed sets, but I must admit that this final set would perfectly complete any ""I Love Lucy"" fan's collection."
5,Nothing left out,"Up until now, the first episode ""How Ricky & Lucy Met"" with Ann Sothern & Cesar Romero omitted the original opening and closing with Hedda Hopper.Lots of trivia & scenes left out on video tape are all there now. Plus there's some color footage.I had invested a hefty amount of money to get these episodes on video tape. I debated a lot about replacing them on DVD. I'm glad I replaced them. Every Lucy fan needs this DVD collection.I now have the COMPLETE ""I Love Lucy"" collection. I'm glad I do"
5,Great dvd,This is a wonderful dvd. I highly suggest it! Has many of my favorite I Love Lucy episodes and would make a great holiday gift.
3,Missing Footage Definitely Disappoints,"Like a previous reviewer, I am definitely disappointed by the footage missing from my favorite episode with Talullah Bankhead. I remember the original version, where she explains that she is allergic to strawberries. For years this segment was cut out, leaving everyone to wonder why she was scratching so furiously in the last of the show, spoiling the gag entirely. When watching the episode with friends I would always have to subsequently explain to them, ""You see, she is allergic to strawberries. They cut that out to make room for commercials."" So, it was with great expectation that I watched the new DVD version, waiting to see the restored scene. IT IS STILL MISSING. This makes me wonder what else is still missing from the other episodes. WHY IS THIS SCENE STILL MISSING??????"
5,Excellent Purchase,"I enjoyed to be taken back in time to the Golden Age of Television with Lucy, Ricky, Fred, Ethel and Little Ricky along with their famous guests. All of the episodes were really funny and enjoyable. Lucy is still the Queen of Television.She rocks!!!!"
3,One Exceptional Disappointment,"This set is great looking and has some terrific features. However, in the Tallulah Bankhead episode there is important footage missing.Some of the missing parts of scenes for the episode are shown in the Bonus Feature section (they was deemed too poor in quality to reintegrate--especially since the excised footage is in 16 mm and the masters are from 35mm).The key plot point footage that is missing, however, involves Miss Bankhead telling Lucy that she is allergic to strawberries (something important to what follows later on).The footage exists somewhere, I have it on videotape, and would have been great to have had in the set.Otherwise, it's a beautiful job by all involved."
3,Caveat Emptor!!!,"I have longed for years to have (I confess, even to SEE) ""The Celebrity Next Door"", and how did my heart leap for joy when I discovered that my time had finally arrived! When the set arrived, I fell at once upon this episode as if I were being reunited with a dear old friend, long since given up for lost ... only to discover to my dismay that the episode I was watching was ... NOT COMPLETE!!! And, in fact, that the cuts had not, IMHO, been terribly well-considered (lines are missing upon which later jokes depend, as in the case of the Strawberry Allergy, or Fred's Butler-Walk). I have not watched any of the other episodes, so I cannot testify directly, but how can one expect they have not met a similar fate? On the other hand, I am in no way nearly as familiar with any of them, and so I may perhaps at least hope to enjoy the bliss of ignorance!For the moment, however, I am left feeling rather flat."
5,I LOVE LUCY,I have been a fan of I Love Lucy since I was a child. Absolutly love being able to enjoy these episodes again.
5,Rather misleading if you ask me,"I feel it's rather misleading to label these episodes as seasons seven through nine of ""I Love Lucy,"" the most popular television series of all-time. This was ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" when it originally aired and I have yet to have one really good laugh from this show as I have numerous times with ""I Love Lucy,"" a show I've been watching for almost fifty years now. I am, however, happy that these episodes have been released on DVD but this will only confuse future generations in my opinion."
3,WHERE IS THE UNRLEASED MOVIE?,I LOVE THE FINAL SEASONS OF I LOVE LUCY! BUT I THINK CBS SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH THE EXTRA BONUSES. WHERE IS THE UNRELEASED MOVIE? THATS WHY I GAVE IT 3 OUT OF 5 STARS
2,I Love Lucy - Season 7-9,"I loved the shows that were included. The only problem was that it was missing disk #3 & I didnt notice it until I went to use it last weekend. My fault for not checking the item as soon as it came in. The existing disks (1, 2 & 4) are GREAT!"
2,Should I Buy This?,"I have always been a Lucy fan and watched the show every time it was on TV. I watch the reruns everyday. I could not wait till the hour long episodes would be released. My favorite was always the episode with Ms. Bankhead. When I started to watch the first one, Lucy meets Desi in Cuba, I realized how bad that one was and how scary Lucy looked in her makeup. She looked like BabyJane Hudson from ""Whatever Happened to BabyJane"".Each episode after that was somewhat funny at times, but the rest were just plain boring. It will never compare to the half hour episodes,they were truly funny.J. Maida"
2,I love luch,Lucy was a the greatest woman comedian of all. I don't enjoy the new ones. I only like the ones with Desi Arnaz. Thanks anyway.
4,Better than I remember,"These were rerun as ""We Love Lucy,"" heavily edited, with lots of commercials, shortly after Lucille Ball's 1989 death. I thought they were very inferior to the half hour series. But watching them now, uncut and uninterrupted, I can see that the comedy is more low-key than the ""zany"" comedy of the first few seasons, and certainly a DVD set that all ""I Love Lucy"" fans will enjoy."
3,The Female Version of Jacob's Ladder,"Without giving too much of the plot away or the ending, let's just say that this movie comes remotely close to a female film version of Jacob's Ladder with Tim Robbins. Siesta, like Ladder, is also filled with flashbacks, bouts of amnesia, ghastly images of death, and a lot of creepy and haunting characters. The mood is equally somber and melancholy. However, Siesta was out before Jacob's Ladder and also shows the viewer some great summer vacation spots in Spain. Siesta is entertaining for those who like art house films and trendy or worldly settings with off-beat and bizarre characters for an overall unique and strange atmosphere. The action can be stagnating at times. However, the soundtrack by Marcus Miller and the late Miles Davis is a must have for any avid collector of c.d. soundtracks. The album also has a moody, jazzy, Spanish flamenco feel to it..."
4,Siesta,"Exotic, filmed in Spain; great soundtrack (Miles Davis); Definitely not for the kiddies, adult subject matter. Short ""Fellini-esque"". I liked the twist at the end."
5,great ending,"I only have one word for this movie. Awsome! see it. You will not be dissapointed. If you liked jacobs ladder, you will love this movie"
3,Not enough of Gabriel Byrne,"I saw this movie for the first time years ago on late night TV and remembered liking it. So I recently bought it but didn't like it as much this time. Almost every scene revolves around Ellen Barkin. This may sound really shallow, but she is not attractive in this movie (especially the wig) and I was getting sick of her running around like a nut dressed in a dirty dress. The first 2/3 of the movie keeps your attention, but the last part fails. What's with the cab driver with metal teeth? I guess I wasn't feeling avant garde enough to ""get"" this movie. It's fun to watch Jodie Foster, Isabella Rossellini, Julian Sands, and of course Gabriel Byrne (second billed but not very many scenes). I recommend it for that."
1,Dull!,"This movie comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. It is photographed in such dark tones that it is often near impossible to see what's happening, which isn't much anyway. The background music has to be one of the most annoying scores ever composed. Characters wander in and out without explanation, or reason, with the result that you just don't care about any of them."
1,Psuedo Intellectual Argle Bargle,"Wahneema Lubiano.....the essence of what is wrong with the academy today. Pure dribble, nonsensical, totally undocumented, UN scholarly trash-on-a-page. Will she EVER actually publish any of her perpetual ""in process"" papers? A disgrace to Duke, the author of the infamous Listening Ad from the Group of 88 and an embarrassment to the community. Save your money or go to a sophomore English class........."
1,typical liberal nonsense,"The title says it all. According to the essay writers in this book, America practically descriminates worse now than it did before the civil rights movement. Sure, the world is not perfect, but from the the words of these people, you would think that blacks were still being actively and severly descriminated against. Of course, there are no alternative views (besides common sense), so I again call this book what it really is, typical liberal nonsense."
2,made cheap,"bought this to hang out by pool, made very flimsy first windy day found it had cracked and was in several pieces."
3,Just okay.....,"'The Ties That Bind' was ... just ok. Not what I've come to expect from JAK. Of course I didn't know until I was halfway thru that it is a reprint of a 1986 Harlequin Temptation. I guess JAK has just grown alot in her writing since then. This was a pretty vintage JAK (which I usually absolutely love) - big business man meets & falls for artsy-craftsy small town girl. Unfortunately, the characters weren't very well developed & therefore it was pretty easy to not fall for our hero all that much. In fact, he ruffled my feathers more than once. Not the first recommendation I'd have for a JAK book."
5,This cd should be so huge!,"One of the finest releases of the year. The amazing guitar sounds and very personal lyrics that pretty much everybody can relate to the words on this album. This cd is full of many potential hit singles. Before I bought the cd, I saw the band open up for AC/DC when their cd was not even out yet. I was totally hooked. The great thing about the songs on the cd is that you can not pigeon hole this band as any certain type of music that bands always get thrown into. Great job!"
4,"like the band, suprised they didnt get more play","good bandlittle bit on the ""generic"" side but better than all the nickleback/staind clones we get nowadaysthey sound like theyd belong more into the seattle grunge movement of the early 90'sit suits the mood when im looking for a good ""grungy alternative rock"" album""bloom"" is a great tune and the reason why i got it""one life"" isnt bad, that's the single that got airplay, and the one that everyone seems to like, i found several on the album i liked better than it though."
5,Great Pictures!,I loved the book. Pictures are great and have really good tips. My 25 months old baby is already swimming by himself!. I bought a second copy for a friend.
2,Run screaming!,"The tornado Tulula mix is fine, and I would agree with a previous reviewer's comment that Amazing Grace/Til The Chicken is fair. But, BT's synethasia Tulula really brings this disk down. It's rhythms and samples are quite ordinary for a dance mix. For a really really long time, they painfully surround vocal samples of Tori saying ""Chasing Tornadoes"". Tori's work is beyond wonderful. This disk is not."
5,Another great hit,"Ms. Byrd is becoming one of my favorite authors. This is a perfect book to end a week with it has passion, love and just the right amount of drama."
2,It was just OK,"The characters were great. Max Collier was a great hero and seemed to be very strong. Kennedy St. James seemed to be beautiful and a grounded woman. The mystery and story line were great. I found myself desperate for passion in the book. It lacked passion and romance. It was as if the romance was an after thought.This book should have never been placed in the romance category. The ending was vague and left a lot to be desired. With the great suspense story line the book had great potential, however, the author missed the mark with this one."
3,Can she trust him?,"If Kennedy St. James expects to live a normal life, she will have to trust Detective Maxwell with a secret that could change her life forever. It has mystery, a touch of humor and desire. I enjoyed it."
2,not a set of 4,"The title clearly says ""set of 4"". I received a larger box but it had only one placemat in it. I am disappointed."
1,Tough to get through it!,This book has been the hardest book to get through that I have ever read. The author's writing style is difficult to follow as he uses phrases and even sentence structure known only to himself!I forced myself to read the book in it's entirety if only to glean some striper fishing facts from it.
5,Great Chamber Jazz,"Recorded for Good Time Jazz at the same time as ""Free 'N Easy"", this is a fine quartet session with Don Ewell joined by Darnell howard, Pops Foster and Minor Hall. I'm not convinced that Pops Foster's presence was necessary and he is rather over-recorded at times, but these are enjoyable performances. Ewell's four solo tracks are characteristically excellent in his understated way, and Howard plays with great fire.Recommended."
5,Super Book,This book was in Great Condition! Great book! I was more than happy with this book - a great find.
1,Not a science book,"My husband wanted me to read this book. He loved it.It started out fine. Like most science books it reviewed the basics. I became slightly annoyed at his insistance that a CONSCIOUS observer is needed for a state vector collapse. It is simply not true.Then came the Zen chapter. I have no problem with Zen. In fact, I have studied Buddhism for many years, but it has no place in a book about science.He the goes on to explain what consciousness is. He makes wild assumptions that he seems to think he has shown to be fact. He then uses these assumptions to ""prove"" his conclution. That God exists. Not just any god, the god of the Bible.I should of expected this, my husband is a Christian, and upset by my non-belief.This book is a very long way for the author to say ""My first love died and I am sad about it. It makes me feel better to think I will see her again in heaven someday."""
3,"Nicely written, but not physics","A well written book, without a doubt. My personal opinion is that the conclusions drawn early in the book are incorrect. Unfortunately, these conclusions are the foundation for the remainder of the work. There are more interesting works on consciousness by Searle, Denett, and Hofstatder. By reading selections from the above authors, one can more fully appreciate the arguments currently running through the field. Of course, if you're looking for something spiritual, and pseudo fact is good enough...go for it :)"
5,The Ultimate Road to Reality,"The Physics of Consciousness takes Physics into a journey that leads it around 360 degrees back to its foundation on sound Philosophy with the addition of the best centuries-old experiences of metaphysical and mystical authorities. This is not simply the exposition of another theory. It represents a lifetime of research and total dedication to find answers to the burning human questions: What is Reality? Why am I here? What happens when I die? Walker exibits the human ability for thorough, methodical, and magnificently detailed analysis of physical theories at its best. This is not only a book to be read as another book on physics. It's a book one can live by."
2,"Ponderous, laborious.","I had a tremendously difficult time with this book, as I have to admit, it was quite a bit over my head. In truth it was the mathematical content that made reading this book a grueling task for me. The major impact of this work however, is of paramount importance. We have a quantum physicist that is imploring the rest of the scientific world to sit up, take notice and embrace the FACT that consciousness exists and that materialism must now be put to rest, like any other dogma that no longer serves (or ever had) a purpose.The writing was a bit clumsy, but all in all, not a horrible read. 2 Stars is all I can muster."
4,Top in class,"Walker's ""Physics of Consciousness"" is about the best I've read on the subject. The nature of consciousness is explored and quantified. The effect of consciousness on the material universe is put forward. Walker takes different interpretations of quantum physics paradoxes and selects those that can fit consciousness into the equations and enlighten us."
3,novice,"I was drawn to this book because there are so many thingsabout which there are no answers and about which I would likeanswers. Reading thru it has been slow because I lack a sciencebackground or forgot it.I find the side bars about the Author's lost love an intrusionand distraction. I thought perhaps, he was motivated to writethis book by the loss of his long time love companion and now thiswas a way not only to answer his questions of what had happened toMerilyn; where is she now and as a way to memorialize her.Because it has been slow going, I am getting a little anxiousand want to do some quantum leaps to material ahead that mightgive me food for thought.For most of my adult life, I have believed that God was everywhere,but now the ""everywhere"" is without limits. The Gospel of Thomason page 327 made me close my eyes and weep. I will finish thisbook in due time and hope that I find some of the answers Iseek."
3,"Cheap, Sound Good, Don't last long","I usually buy Elixir strings and these strings, for about one week, sounded almost as good. A nice, full, bright tone with the Lights. Then they just died. I have some Elixir phosphor bronze strings on a $50 beater guitar that are about a year old that sound infinitely better than these D'Addario do on my $300 daily guitar now. I do play every day, but I was seriously amazed at the lack of life on these strings, especially considering they are phosphor bronze wound. They are cheap (about 1/3 the price of Elixirs), so I guess if you don't mind replacing your strings every couple weeks then these aren't necessarily bad. However, I do not plan on buying these strings again."
4,good tone but too squeaky for being a coated string,"Love the tone and playability, but it is a bit of a misnomer to call this a 'coated' string, implying it is comparable to say Elixer strings. These are hard to record with due to the finger noise but they sure sound good playing live with."
5,Not as good as you would think.,I have been using D'Addario Phosphor Bronze since they came out in 1974. I use nothing else on my 2000 Gibson Advanced Jumbo. These coated strings don't keep the new sound any longer than uncoated EJ-16's.
4,they're just coated strings,"These are guitar strings, and yes they have a 'tinny' sound. As you break 'em in the sound changes.Any guitar strings, whether they were subjected to repeated use, or collecting dust never to be played need to be changed often. That's my take - I prefer not to play ""dead strings"".These are nice strings for the money, yet of course I would prefer not to have to pay for them :D"
3,These won't wash..,"Right out of the package these string sound dull and lifeless, almost like an uncoated set used for 2 weeks. Treble is sucked out of wound strings and sustain is quite reduced. Maybe coating the bronze wire before winding makes these strings damped worse than elixir strings.I could not stand these strings on my guitar for 3 days, and reverted to elixir(nanoweb 0.012-0.053) and my guitar started breathing again.."
3,purchased wrong strings,Perhaps wonderful guitar strings but .... certainly NOT for a Spanish style acoustic guitar! Steel style and way too heavy.
2,Strings Make a Squeaking Noise,I do not like these coated strings at all. They make a squeaking noise when you play finger style.
5,Best coated string,I have been using the EXPs for some time now on electic-acoustics and they have become my go-to string. I find the coating to be less noticeable than on El***rs and tonal variations to be less from string to string and set-to-set. Highly recommended.
3,tonal quality is flat,I like Elixir. I had to try this one because of another friend said it's ok and cheaper.I tried it and the quality is low end.The sound is not as crisp.The gauge is too heavy for my fingers (not their problem)All 6 strings are wrapped inside one single bag.I'd go back to Elixir next time.
5,Excellent product,"I haven't tried any other string brands on this particular guitar . But my Daddy used to say , "" If it ain't broke , don't fix it ..."""
4,Works well,"doesn't last as long or sound as bright as Elixirs but these are half the price. Good bargain though for $6.99.sounds all right to me, bright and well balanced sound.My little brother can't tell the difference since he's new, but it works well on his guitar."
5,love these strings.,Personally I just love the D'Addario strings. They sute my needs just right for the Takamine acoustic. Great quality and price.
3,Meh,"I was not impressed with this set of strings. Although the gauges are standard, I found these to feel rather stiff for light strings. Furthermore, the tone of the A and low E is very ""warm"", for some values of ""warm""; I think a lot of people might even call it ""dull"". There's a marked contrast between these and the wound G, which is much brighter. There's virtually no finger noise with these strings; for some folks this is a plus, but to others that's part of the definition of ""dull"". If you like your strings stiff and very mellow, you might like these, but otherwise I'd stay away."
4,decent strings,"not too bad for coated strings.if you're going with coated, i'd stick with elixir's or cleartones.better tone, in my opinion."
3,80/20 Bronze Strings,"Not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze? Not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze. The EXPs are nice strings. They have a nice feel to them along with less string noise. And they last. My two acoustic guitars, a Takamine Mini jumbo and a Gretsch jumbo, both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars. I figured i would try these 80/20 strings after using phospher bronze. Only real problem i noticed is the 80/20s seem brighter and they ring longer. I prefer the warmer tone. And since my guitars have alot of ""boom"" already, i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast. I imagine these strings may work in some instances, but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars."
4,Enlightening...and entertaining story,"This book tells the story of the great Mormon anti-polygamy crusade of the 1880s. The author writes a fictional account, but with a few actual historical personages. A very good reading leaving the reader with the question, ""Why?"" on both sides of the issue."
3,ok not great,"Quite boring. There does not seem to be any kind of chemistry between those two actresses, so I did not believed the love story. Anyway, idea of this movie was ok."
3,Book This Room at Your Own Risk,"This movie has a little something for everyone: For men, you've got two women (one attractive, one 'meh') who are naked 95% of the movie; for women, the two naked women talk for 95% of the movie; and for the androgynous artsy-types, they'll view all that talking as a meditation on the value of the truth in relationships. Only, all the lying isn't pulled off with quite the same panache as it is in, say, The Usual Suspects (you'll see what I mean if you watch this). This is exactly the kind of movie you want to give five star but just can't if you enjoy movies with a discernible plot. There is none, which is made even less enjoyable when there are only two characters in the whole movie to deal with. At least the sex-scenes were passionate, hence the three stars."
5,Steamy,"This movie is quite steamy. I did enjoy the views of Rome (when they were out of the bedroom), and would have liked to have seen more of the city."
5,pfffft....,"I happened upon the reviews for Room in rome looking for something else. The negative reviewers must have been watching a different movie. There are so many things I loved about this movie. The lies we tell ourselves and others. Were the actors naked? Barely noticed, I was so engrossed in the story and their interaction. Many parts of this story reminded me of times in my life. My girlfriend and I love this cute little movie. I suggest the negative reviews watch it again."
1,dreadful,"Really, that's all I can say about this film---whether it's the acting, the script, the plot, the excessively dark lighting, the so-called love scenes. Awful!"
1,The most boring movie ever made,"I never thought I could be so bored watching two naked ladies, but I was. I couldn't even make it half way through before I removed the DVD and threw it into the garbage. This is just a chick-flick for lesbians, because no guys could possibly be interested in the endless dialogue about nothing. These girls just drone on and on about nothing in particular, most of which is just them telling lies. I guess the fact that they are naked for 99% of the time is supposed to keep you tuned in. But like they said on Seinfeld: ""There's good naked, and there's bad naked."" Well, let me tell you, this was ""bad naked."" No stars for you! (Yes, I know, it shows that I gave it one star. But this is because Amazon forced me to.)"
1,Room in Rome,"This film was such a huge disappointment as I'd read lots of positive reviews and it had screened at soem fantastic queer festivals. Unfortunately, t tries way too hard to conform to some warped version of psychoanalysis and ends up being uninteresting in the extreme with characters that you don't care about. Without anything at stake except whether they'll stay together or not, the argument becomes very circular and repetitive for the viewer."
4,Wonderfully unusual love story!,"This is a very enjoyable movie. I loved the lighting and photography in it. The music is also great. In spite of the fact that both actresses are naked most of the time throughout the movie, both actresses deliver their lines beautifully and naturally, and as the story develops you get emotionally involved with the characters. They really seem at ease with themselves and with each other and just flow. They share a moment in life, passion, fantasies, stories, emotions; a room. And the witness for this unusual love story is precisely a room in Rome."
4,great story beautiful women,Great Lesbian love story. One of the better movies made for the ladies.Very sexy and highly recommend. The movie was well made
3,low budget nose,"My review of the product is based on a distinct use. We needed a prop for a London based playhouse play based on 'Cyrano de Bergerac'. Unfortunately the prop department did not have a long nose so we searched far and wide. We came up with this. It took a bit of drilling, some cutting, and an extended string to hold it up but it worked well.Would recommend to any props department or FX crews on a low budget."
1,To big around,This product shouldn't be sold as it can rip a woman wide open I don't care how much lub you use people don't buy this
3,Review,"Shaft thickness and density were good. Like the real thing. It was flexible enough to use on myself on my back. My only problem was the head was too soft, so I didn't get that pressure we ladies like when it was going in. But for the $15 I paid for it. 3 out of 5."
5,"@ 1st. its like, Wow, its large, but she loves it!!","Wife wasn't sure about the size at first, but with the help of lube, and she loved it. While the size is something to get used to, once you do, you won't be disappointed. If she's satisfied, I'm satisfied. When I can't take it anymore I let Adam take over. LOL.. I'm satisfied with the purchase. It was purchased at Amazon (Prime acct.) This item ships very discreetly and quickly."
3,"Wow, That's Huge","Feels nice. Very flexible but HUGE. I mean HUGE. If you are a size queen then this is great but for me it wasn't. When I saw it come out of the box my mouth dropped. And not in a good way. This is just too much for me. But it does stick well to smooth surfaces, cleans up easily, and is realistic feeling."
3,See.. I am simply.. petite...,"I give it a three because it is very nice to look at. It can be arousing because of how fantasy-realistic it is for me. And when I am using something else, this is very nice to touch and grab for it's very realistic texture. It is a very arousing addition to any 'play'!As for insertion...I've had to painfully forget about it. It's very large around, but pleasing to the eyes. Not to mention amazingly entertaining to shock your friends with."
4,Nice,"Bought this for the wife and just had a chance to use it this weekend. When I first took it out She was like ""No way!! That's way to big"". Well with some astroglide & some foreplay she was able to take it. I love being able to watch my wife with a toy and this was fantastic to watch & the orgasm she had was AMAZING!.I would've given this a 5 star rating except for the chemical smell that just won;t seem to go away. As far as people complaining of the ""sticky: nature of the material, a little corn starch after you clean it keeps it nice and clean and ready for action. I can;t wait to use it again on her."
