1,Cheaper elsewhere...,I like to deal with amazon for my book purchases online and was looking to see what this series would cost... I looked at sears like several of the reviews said... it is now (4/15/12) $39.99 for the complete seasons 1-4... is this simply a MAJOR screwup... or is this the way it is with ALL videos? If so... I will know to look OTHER PLACES for any videos/movies from now on...
3,Good...I guess,"I was so excited to receive these DVDs that i immediately played Disc 1 of Season 1. The problem with that was, Disc 1 would not properly play. When I looked at hte back of the disc, it was ""sprayed"" with some purple thing that would not come off. It was not any type of scratch and I cannot tell what it is. All I know is that the DISC WILL NOT PLAY!!!!!"
4,Nice!,"A lot of fun to look back at all previous episodes. Makes the new a lot of fun. (Good Clean fun,) I have a 80 year old mother that LOVES this show! Something she has in common with her grandchildren"
5,The Only Dance in Iowa:A History of six player girls' bb,"I played six player bb in high school in Texas and I also got to personally meet Mr. Cooley when we played in Iowa in college so this was a special book for me. He was a good friend of my college coach. For anyone not familiar with 6 player bb, this would be interesting reading. It lasted longer in Iowa than it did in TX and mainly because of Mr. Cooley."
5,Another Hall of Fame Effort. . .,"The Rod Stewart Album, one of Rod's early solo efforts, is indicative of his work at that time. Strong songs, delivered with a one-of-a-kind voice and Stewart's enthusiasm all add up to great stuff.Stewart sticks to his playbook of the period, penning some of the songs (Blind Prayer, An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down) and borrowing from some famous mates. In this case, he puts his spin on the Richards and Jagger tune ""Street Fighting Man."" Stewart does it justice.Handbags and Gladrags, which received kudos when included on the Unplugged and Seated CD, appears for the first time here and remains a signature song in the Stewart catalogue.For Stewart Fans, no collection is thorough enough without this album."
5,Must Have...,"You must have this CD in your collection if you love rock n roll. No bad cuts here. In fact a number of tunes are written by Rod himself. It seems he is quite the song writer..The song "" I Wouldn't Change a Thing"" is the highlight of highlights. I plan to use this at my wake to let my friends know how I feel about the whole life on earth thing...The band Rod has is outstanding. Keith Emerson on organ, Ron Wood on slide, Ian MacLagan on piano and organ among others...I have thousands of CD's and this one get more airplay than all the others..."
4,Stewarts forst solo disc,"This lp has the pattern that Stewart would follow for years, hard rocking songs with some slower ballad type numbers. If you like Stewarts work on Jeff Becks ""Truth"" and Beck-ola, and the Faces, you will like this."
4,Rod when he rocked,"A nice mix of ballads and rockers, worth buying for ""Blind Prayer"" (I love that song) and ""Street Fighting Man"" alone. This is Rod Stewart before he became a caricature of himself and turned into a boring pop star."
5,Rod the Mod,"This was ROD STEWART first solo album after leaving JEFF BECK. His career began with this record, following many others. His voice and style is one of a kind. A TRUE front man!!!!!! I thought it would be a hit or a miss in finding this album.Thanks Amazon you're AMAZING!!!!!"
3,classic Monroe recordings--at a bargain price,"All the classic Marilyn Monroe recordings are present on this budget disc from the Goldies label. If you're just staring to collect Monroe albums this may be a good place to start; but seasoned collectors will love it just as much.Most of the cuts seem to be taken directly from the magnetic soundtracks of the movies they came from (for example ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" from GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES, and ""River of No Return"" from the movie of the same name). There are some alternate studio cuts too, like ""I'm Gonna File My Claim"" (from RIVER OF NO RETURN) and ""Heat Wave"" from THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOWBUSINESS. Fans will be glad to know that this 14-track compilation also includes the live audio clip of Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday"" to President Kennedy--complete with Peter Lawford's intro.A fun disc for MM fans! [GOLDIES GLD-63118]"
2,"Record label exec calls out ""who else does Portishead""","The ultimate in one-hit wonder bands, Mono, with their epynomous song ""Life in Mono"" manages to ripoff the trip hop ""Portishead"" sound so convincingly that they were able to get themselves a major lable record contract. Unfortunately, save for their hit single, the rest of the disc is a collection of throwaway clunkers. True. I'm not being fair. I can't seem to get through about song five, so maybe there are a few keepers on the flipside. After a few ""numb""ers I'm usually ready for a small dose of the real thing, which is the self-titled Portishead album - a masterpiece in noir cut-and-paste beats with tragic, yet sulky not quite sauntry, vocals."
5,Absolutely Flawless,"An Amazing first release that is utterly perfect. A minimalist attitude that shows Mono knows exactly what they're doing. Ingenious riffs that get played only once or twice during the whole song make more of an impression than the repetitive nature of most pop. Mix Techno with some 60's swing and you have one unique CD. Like Depeche Mode's albums there is not one ""filler"" song anywhere in sight on this CD. This is on my Top 10 list for this decade..."
4,Cool Album,"Nice mix of electronics and other types of music. I find this CD very relaxing, I am glad I found it."
4,Formica Blues,"This is an unbelievable album. I wish Mono would release more albums. The music is unlike anything I've ever heard. It's like Film Noir/Soundtrack james bond music. Great instrumentation, nice moody lush instrumentation."
3,life in mono,"I recommend getting it if only for just this one song. It's one of those kind of songs that you know that you've heard somewhere, in a movie perhaps? but you're not quite sure where exactly you've heard it. Now, the rest of the album is, I think, kind of dull, but bareable....that one song just suckers you in....if only the rest of the CD could be that good."
2,Very Overrated,"My enjoyment of old Hooverphonic lead me to recommendations of Mono. However, at close listen Formica Blues proved to be too mediocre to enter my collection. Most songs sound too contrived to float, and (yawn) I wasn't impressed with the inarticulate composition nor musicianship. Their fleeting glimpse of aural brilliance and fame on ""Life in Mono"" is available on single, so I happily purchased that instead."
1,I spend money for the nothing,"This is not a 'trick' not a 'hop' This is stupid french pop, where sometimes appears trick's samples and rythm. French musick is dead."
5,Damn Good!,"This CD is the type of CD that you would play for a girlfriend/boyfriend when you just want to hang out and take a break. Its also a good CD to listen to when studying or when doing something that you would feel more confortable doing in a more relaxed state. I would realy recomend it if you liked the Sneaker Pimps, Portishead, and any type of Alt.Indie style of music."
5,When does their next CD come out?!!!!!,"I absolutely love this CD. Siobhan has the voice of an angel and every song is fantastic. As a matter of fact I seduced my boyfried to this CD and will never listen to it in the same way again. I recommend it to anyone who finds themselves in a ""romantic"" mood...very sexy music!"
3,from a skeptic - it grows on you,"i was encouraged by all the positive reviews of this album and bought it on semi-whim. after the first 2 listens i was bummed as it seemed like the same fluff track after track. i was hoping for something a little stronger. but to mono's credit, it _did_ grow on me and i now like it much better."
3,formica blues review,"I bought the cd because I really like the song ""Life in Mono"" (which is one of my favorite songs) and wanted to get it on cd because I only had it on cassette originally. The rest of the cd is ok with a few other decent songs on it but some other songs I didn't care for."
3,Sultry trip-hop.,"Is your dorm room messy? Play this silky European pop and it will suddenly seem ""bohemian."" Mono's warm electronica and sixties melodic sensibility make almost any setting feel more upscale than it really is, so it's a perfect backdrop to those special social occasions you plan with your significant other -- just don't play it when your jock friends are around unless you want a wedgie!Some songs let the intros and endings go on too long...I wish they'd erred on the side of leaving us wanting more. If you haven't bought Hooverphonic's ""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular"" yet, get it first. It's more varied and adventurous."
4,St Etienne heavy,"Maybe the popularity of this CD in Detroit comes from the fact that a local radio station plays ""Life in Mono"" at around midnight, or at least when you are entering REM sleep. I think it's a great CD if you get past the first track - which is a bit overproduced - try the last track for the better rendition. I don't think Mono is so much Portishead as it St Etienne - only the vocals are a bit more hollow. And yes, I like ""Slimcea Girl."""
2,This is a review of the Bonus CD,"You're better off just buying Formica Blues -the US domestic release.The bonus CD blows. And this harshness does not come from the lack of creativity with the remixes, but more from the added cost of this CD overall; it's just not worth the money.The tracks you're gunning for are 3, 6, 8 and 9. The rest are mere hum-drum (ugly) harmonic experiments with neglect of the original vocals. I liked tracks 8 and 9 -they were remixed with a party-mood in mind. The Mr. Scruff Remix of Silicone (track 5) is okay.The Bonus CD is 10 tracks, 5 of which I liked, so my rating is 2.5 stars. It's hit and miss. ""Remix"" does not equal ""better"" -in the case of Mono, it's hard to top off the original mixes."
3,Basic Insight into Lockpicking,"The book is ok if you are looking for a ways to enter into places without having the right tools. The section for handcuffs is interesting. Other than that there are better books out there for lockpicking.The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing (Complete Book of Locks & Locksmithing)andVisual Guide to Lock Picking (Third Edition)to name just two.The book does give you an initial impulse to look other places if you've locked yourself out, but I found the drawings pretter cumbersome at times. The book seems to be written for most U.S. homes and locks and wasn't of much use for myself living in Europe.A good book for some general hints. If you are in to lockpicking then I would recommend other books."
4,Practical tips for the beginner ...,"I actually picked this little number up on Amazon while it was free in digital format. I'm not intending to get into the lock opening business anytime soon, but I enjoyed reading through the basic tips and tricks that are contained in this book.Just remember to keep your practice to your locks and you will stay out of a lot of trouble."
3,basic knowledge,"I thought i would pick up a skill by getting these dvds but theyre very basic knowledge of lock picking, and you need to pactice on locks to get the hang of it."
4,'A Star in the Window' is a great historical read,"I was given this book at Christmas as a used book that was found in my grandmother's library. I wasn't so sure I would be interested in reading it, but I happily found out otherwise. This book starts out slow, but quickly gains a pulse and becomes fascinating. By the middle of the book, I could not put it down and continued reading it the rest of the night. I suggest this book if you like historical fiction. Although, it might be hard to find it in a book store."
1,Watch for the switch,"The Item They ship is not the same as what they show. The item shipped comes with no directions as to how to use what they ship you but with directions for what is pictured. The pictured item shows a ratching device, the one they send has no such feature. I am sending it back and going to the store to buy the right one."
4,Fast Action,"The EP-3E Aries reconnaissance plane makes a cameo appearance in this book, as the instigator of the entire plot line. The action picks up with two F/A-18 Hornets hiding under its wings, and barely slows down for the rest of the 400 pages. The Blue Angel flying details seem plausible enough, but that kind of plane isn't my specialty. I didn't have any trouble suspending my disbelief through most of the story. We see inter-agency distrust and squabbling; we see power struggles at all levels of bureaucracy; we see special forces members saving the day nearly single-handedly. I found the action and plot quite engaging and will definitely pick up a few other books by this author."
3,Lots of action! But it's no Tom Clancy,"This book had a lot of action and reminded me of your average military type thriller movie. The author starts off trying to portray the Algerians objectively but quickly falls into using the middle eastern stereotype. I guess it works OK for this book but I found it a little predictable and definintely un-original. If you're interested in the Blue Angels you'll definitely enjoy this book, some of the flying scenes are cool. Otherwise, it's OK...not the best ever but reasonably entertaining."
2,What a disapointment!,"Out of the box this game was a let down and waste of money...the timer did not work and each of the playing cards had to be punched out of a sheet of flimsy cardboard...several tore even though we tried to be very careful...we will never know how much fun the game was to actually play since the timer didn't work...we tried playing without it but my kids (ages 5, 5, & 3) simply were not interested. My advice is to not waste your time and money with this one!"
2,NOT SO IMPRESSED,"I bought this for my daughter for fine motor enhancement. I found it rather difficult to do and I am pretty good with fine motor activities. It was pretty frustrating for her and, therefore, we didn't play it very often. I was not so impressed with it."
3,Pretty good stuff,"Admittedly, I prefer Mary Mulari's ideas, but these are some nice ""little things"" you can make when you are using scraps or whatever. The overstitched purse and portfolio have given me ideas to use my ""stash"" of fabric scraps and to use that to make more of Mary Mulari's projects. If nothing else it will give you ideas."
1,Corrosion !,"I bought this from a department store (along with the rest of the Butterfly Meadow Bath set). Most of the items are good quality, but the soap/lotion dispenser is junky. The ""metal"" part of the dispenser pump gets corroded. It has dark-brown rusty looking stuff, plus on the inside, some greenish stuff (like it's from copper).Anyway, I wrote to Lenox, and hopefully they will have some kind of better replacement or something. If I get a response, I'll add to this review.In the meantime, don't get this dispenser. The other items are nice, though.UPDATESo, I wrote to Lenox about this item, and they sent me a new pump part. What they said is to NOT put soap or hand sanitizer in them -- the water corrodes it. So, I guess you can put hand lotion??? Anyway, they were very nice about it, though I wish I could put soap in it !!!"
3,Don't buy this set,"I love the dispenser but sponge holder looks very cheap. At first I thought I could use the sponge holder as a teabag holder, but it looks so cheap that I'd better not to do that. I don't know why but this has different quality from any other butterfly series. The dispenser also has the same quality as the sponge holer but it still looks better so that I am satisfied with it. But the sponge holder, it's a disater. If I knew that, I would have bought only the dispenser."
2,"A great lesson, but it's a basic one.","If they would change the DVDs name to ""Some stuff with metalsmith"" it would have been less disappointing.Don't get fooled by the nice cover, and the affiliation to the book ""The Complete Metalsmith"" this DVD is a very very basic 70 min, that actuallyends with the words ""Well, we have covered the basics!"" btw it's from the 80's and everything he shapes is very primary.He is not making jewelery, just tells you about soldering and tampering, with plain pieces of metal.If you are looking for something that talks about design you'd be disappointed.He does makes 1 ring for example, but it is sssso 70's and low-tec.I did enjoy watching it but it wasn't worth the $.Definitely disappointing.I guess it could be effective for an absolute beginner it has a few tips, but it's not ""The complete Metalsmith"". Better get the book."
1,Small business owner,"I reviewed the Viking claim that this SIMM was compatible with the OEM (HP) SIMM.I purchased the product, and installed the SIMM in my printer and it DID NOT work as advertised. The LaserJet 4 printer couldn't recognize the SIMM no matter which SIMM slot I used. Resetting the printer didn't help.Advise is to be very careful about purchasing SIMMs for HP printers. Many ""compatible"" product are not compatible at all. Problem is, with the small amount of money involved, and considering shipping, it's not worth returning the item.I can't trust Viking again."
3,For Nostalgia Buffs,"The Joy Machine read just like an episode of the Original Series. Had it been an actual episode, it would have been considered somewhere in the middle of the pack as far as favorite episodes go, IMHO. Nevertheless, even though it is filled with cliches, predictable twists, and a pat ending typicl of ROS episodes, I had a good time ""visualizing"" the novel as an episode. I gave it three stars because that was a neat experience. For literary merit (or close proximity there f) it deserves less.For the Trekker completists only."
2,The Boredom Machine,"I really wanted to read this book, when I first heard about it, but now I wish I never did. The story is okay, and could have made a good episode if it was filmed then, in the 60-s. Now it feels outdated. Also, it never should be a novel, but a short story, like those James Blish adaptations of original episodes.At least then, with the loss of some scenes, the ending could be more convincing (SPOILER: the characters discussed a biblical scene once in a place where Joy Machine must have heard them, and in the end Kirk described the SAME scene to convince the Machine to turn off).Lastly, I didn't like Mr. Gunn's style and it seemed to me he isn't very familiar with Trek universe. For example, Kirk said that he couldn't help the population of Timshel because of Prime Directive, although the planet is a member of Federation."
5,Works in a HP Laser Jet 2100TN,"This memory works properly in my HP Laser Jet 2100TN. The price is excellent, and going from 8 MB 40MB massively speeds the printing of large .pdf files."
1,Not Compatible,"This product, which is billed as compatible with HP Part #4137A, should be compatible with the Laserjet 1100 series printer as well. However, to my dismay, it locked up the printer every time it was installed -- and yes, it was installed properly."
1,Incompatible with HP 1100se,I unplugged my printer and inserted the DIMM per HP's instructions that came with the printer. I plugged the power cord back in and I was greeted with 3 steady lights. I looked up the code in my manual which is FATAL ERROR.Now I have to return the DIMM. This is *not* the same as the HP C4137A DIMM module that HP specifies.(1 Star is being generous!)
3,Tasty but watch out for pits!,"The cherries are well-preserved and taste good, but each bag has at least a couple with the pits still in them. Chew SLOWLY. Also there are off-colored ones in the bags, so if you're turned off by that don't buy them. I don't care about that, they all taste fine."
3,"great source of anti-oxidants, but.. . .","like many natural foods, these organice dried cherries are stocked with antioxidants - great for stamina, both cerebral and muscular.However, the quality is poor; they have a very unpleasant appearance, and some pits remain (about 1 per bag)"
2,More Pits Than Cherries,"The cherries are okay, but there are WAY too many pits -- not the ""occasional"" pit the package warns against. And they're not easy to remove, either, because the cherries are so intensely desiccated. Save your teeth and your wallet and get your cherries somewhere else."
2,"If you are sensitive to a ""dirt-like,"" taste, then do not purchase","Bare Fruit Organic Dried Cherries, 2.6-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)While this purchase was made when this product was on clearance, the expiration date had not expired,and I, as well as two other people, found this product to be distasteful due to a ""dirt-like,"" flavor and not a ""fruit-filled cherry"" one. Personally, I do not believe that this is due to the fact that the fruit is organic and unsweetened for I purchase these types of products often. If you have purchased these packages already, you may try soaking them in juice overnight in the refrigerator and using them as a more healthful topping for: pancakes, waffles, sundae desserts, etc."
5,dried cherries without sugar added,"This makes an excellent, healthy snack since there is no sugar added. I typically only eat half a package and end up saving the rest for another time. Some people will like this product and I'm sure others will not; it really depends on what you are looking for. The Kleins brand dried cherries adds sugar to their product. My guess is alot. The two products really sit at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bare fruit is just as the name suggests, nothing but the fruit, whereas Kleins are extremely sweet, and sugary; In my opinion its almost too much. If you like your dried fruit to be on the sweet side I would recommend Kleins Brand, but if you are looking for a more natural snack item definitely go with the Bare Fruit brand."
2,you have to be a health nut to want to eat these,full of pips. unsweetened and extremely chewy. If this is your style - go for it.
1,bad cherried,"The cherries taste rancid. Very disappointing for an organic product. We expected a brighter, fresher flavor. Maybe the sale price was an indication of quality. My husband says they taste like prunes."
2,Gritty and tasteless,"I ordered this brand because it had the least amount of sugar.The cherries were gritty (dirty?, sand?) and did not have the tart taste of locally purchased dried cherries. Now I'm stuck with a whole box of them that no one in my family wants to eat."
4,Great Tasting! - Some Pits,"I bought these and really enjoyed them. There is a note of caution on the back of the bag stating be careful of pits. I've had 2 bags so far, and have found 3 pits between the 2 bags. I will let you know if the future shows to be excessive too. I will sacrifice watching for pits, because at least I know it is natural, without pesticides and chemicals. If you are looking for something very sweet, don't order this. It is typical of other dried fruit, which is generally not as sweet as a very ripe piece of fruit. But, if you are looking for the nourishment and vitamins of good fruit, but can't get fresh or want the convenience of carrying dry fruit, this is for you. Makes for a great, nutritious snack."
1,I wanted to like these,"I'm sure they are quite healthy. But I hated the taste --- they really had no taste, and a funny aftertaste. It might very well be the base flavor of whatever type of cherries they started with, so others might be OK with it. Texture was OK, mine are not gritty, but honestly, I'm going to throw them out."
4,love it but beware,"I love this bag, I have the smaller one too, lots of space, the option of one large inside compartment or two smaller compartments. It comes in very handy, plus all the pockets.However, beware it doesnt meet all airline size requirements. I went use it around Christmas and had to pay extra cus it was 1"" too big, the porter noticed it and cost me $100, bugger.Otherwise I love the bag, and the smaller one is just as great."
1,Poor contruction for European streets and walks,"My wife and I went to Amsterdam a few months ago, i searched the internet for the best rolling duffle bag i could find, i bought two of these for the trip.My wife's wheel broke off on the street day one and on day two the back of mine shattered, yes shattered and that made the wheels cave in. We searched all day for a luggage cart to bunge our new broken bags to and spent the next 10 days traveling europe wrestling with this shattered back, wheel draging crap! Although i did like the color :)Dont bother with this brand if you need a strong pull bag!!!"
3,Revsion,Watch out for the rev level. Mapolois is currently at rev 4.x and needs the NC map pack - this is the NB pack and is not compatible with the newer version.
3,Good clean fun,"Was already familiar with the movie, but bought anyway. Good to see Ruth Gordon and Robert Morley, before they passed-on. Lucy Gutteridge is also in ""Top Secret"", which is hilarious!"
1,Too Vague,"The back cover praise says ""I only wish it was available to our staff as we developed some of our earliest services.""This might be true for somebody who has been a lawyer or a doctor his whole life and then one morning wakes up with the idea of building a Mobile Location Service.On the other end anybody who only knows what Mobile Location Services are all about will find this book poor.It just tells what is all the stuff you might need without delving into any detail. It simply restates the problem. For example the chapter about map displaying is only about ""illuminating"" us on what a rasted image is compared to a vectorial. At the end of it you won't know anything you didn't know before and won't be anywhere ahead to building your service.In the end it looks more like a newspaper Sunday edition article to be read by that lawyer or that doctor than like a book who could be of any use to somebody wishing to build a Mobile Location Service."
1,what! appendices more than the content?,"Well, i'm not sure if this is a rush job. One of the chapter is just 5 pages long and the appendices are having more number of pages than the content. Reason is, the GML, LIF and P3P specification could have been provided as an URL instead of printing the whole thing in the book. Can anyone imagine that. Not up to my expectation as ""the definitive guide""."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A lost race type novel. A large reclamation project to turn desert toarable land will have a large effect on the people that live under thatdesert. A couple of surface dwellers get caught up with these people.You'd have to really, really like mushrooms to stay."
5,Mark,This video had some glitches but was still the one that I remember watching years ago. If you read the book it is close. The return of King Richard is I believe underplayed but I haven't read the book in 20 years.
4,History,"we had 2 watch this in history and thought it was pretty good but i didnt hear half of it cause my class wouldn't stop talking. i liked when athelstane came ""back from the dead"" and everyone was soooooooo scared. hope enjoy the video if you buy it."
1,This movie was awful,"I have no idea why everyone is giving this movie such high ratings. It strays so far from the book that it is extremely disappointing. The acting is terrible! I mean, really. I can't believe top names like Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Taylor and Joan Fontaine could act so bad but they did. The movie could have been excellent, if they had stayed closer to the true story. Very disappointing."
5,Great Story and a Classic Film,"One of the true classics with an all star cast. If you like this genera of film, you'll love this!"
4,True to the book!,"And enjoyable film about a violent era. I first saw Ivanhoe as a teenager - not long after having read the book as a mandatory assignment in English class. The passage of more than five decades has not changed my opinion of Ivanhoe. The film is a well made classic. Anyone who reads the book feels that Ivanhoe should have squired and loved faithful, selfless Rebecca. The same holds true for the film. But these were the Middle Ages, the time of Christian fervor when Crusaders marched off to drive infidels out of the Holy Land, and Jews were lesser people in England's social structure. So, staying true to his class, noble Ivanhoe forsakes Rebecca (played by young and stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Taylor) and returns to Rowena. One can assume that that's the way it would've been in Medieval England. But had I been in Ivanhoe's shoes, I might've said ""Convention be damned!"""
4,Entertaining...,Good old-fashion fun! Love being able to show these movies to my kids and not worry about the content!! They loved the action...
3,"Good film, incomplete adaptation","Anyone who has read Sir Walter Scott's novel, the inspiration for this movie, and hoping to find a faithful screen adaptation will be disappointed. Most of the major characters are present, as are many of the major plot points. However, much has been left out, and the character and story of the film diverges from that of the book. The film has a wonderful cast, beautiful costumes, and otherwise excellent production, but I found portions of it lacking, and the result is that while it is interesting and entertaining, it is not very compelling."
5,Not exactly an accurate storyline...but very well done,"The book Ivanhoe is my all-time favorite. That being the case, I have read it numerous times. The movie bears some resemblance to it. But Wamba the fool does not run away with Ivanhoe (whose first name is Wilfred, by the way), and he does not die in the siege of the castle. There are other discrepancies, but overall the movie makes a good impression. I think that Ivanhoe was Robert Taylor's best character, but you are free to disagree. Altogether, this is a rousing swashbuckler, worthy of Errol Flynn."
3,A Classic Tale of Knighthood,This 1952 tale depicting a knight named Ivanhoe stars Liz Taylor and is based on the classic novel Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott. It was flagged as excellent for children and was listed as recommended in Complete Paladin's Handbook. A fair movie nominated for 3 Oscars apparently.
3,Ivanhoes,"I share much of the enjoyment expressed by others for this 'Ivanhoe'; but I much prefer the 'Ivanhoe' with James Mason (Isaac), et al."
3,Hollywood made Middle Ages,"This film brings back very fond memories, when I was just a kid! Here is a colorful, well made movie that really contributed to my growing interest for the Middle Ages. The costumes are great and so are the actors. They don't make like that anymore... Typically 1950's."
5,Steve Poltz is a STUD!!,"I have been listening to Steve Poltz ever since he was in the Rugburns. Being a native San Diegan, it is really nice to see a local boy make it big. I went out and bought the CD the first day it came out, I was so excited. This CD is definitely one of my favorites in my collection. It is fun to listen to and separates itself from the old Rugburns stuff he used to do. The combination of his folk style guitar and his laid-back sorta rustic voice provides for a good hour of listening."
3,"Steve, you've done better.","There are several good songs on this album, like Silver Lining and Beautiful Day. Definitely worth a listen, but not quite good enough to listen to straight through. Poltz has a gorgeous voice, which he does not fully display on this album (too many years of vocal abuse?). If you like the Rugburns' albums, you are not guaranteed to enjoy this - very mellow and most songs are about broken hearts. But maybe I'm just emotionally jaded... But, again, there are several nice recordings on this album, so give it a try."
1,$202.75 for a used 18% Grey Card ! ! ! ?,"There has got to be a mistake here or else I'm in the wrong line of work.$202.75 for a used 18% grey card? You got to be kidding right? People don't be ripped off here, go to your local Photography Store and buy two new ones for under $20.00, complete with instuctions. 18% Grey Card is a very useful tool, but don't let someone steal you blind."
3,"VERY HALPFULL TOOL, BUT...","... but made of very poor paper. Although kept in shelves, marks become visible. Another thing is that there is no space for holding the card, without touching the actual surface. It can be used for a period of few months only, so you should consider buying a few of them if you are about to use them on a regular basis."
2,Walmart Cheapo specials,These strings are horrible. The best thing about them was the tin package. They made my acoustic guitar have bad string buzz. I'm gonna give these a pass.
5,They're just strings,"These are just guitar strings - color coded, so they can be identified. I liked their little case which can be used for holding CD's afterward. I'm sure these aren't for professional guitarists, but it's from First Act!"
1,Not for classical guitars,"I'm sure these are fine strings, but I discovered to my dismay that they are not what I needed at all. While the packaging says ""acoustic,"" it does not specify that these are made for a steel-string acoustic guitar, not a classical one. When I tried to return them locally, I could not find a single store that carried them, which makes me think this may be a discontinued item. First Act, the manufacturer, doesn't even list these on its own Web site. So...buyer beware, and lesson learned."
1,Received Two Defective Copies,"I purchased the 3 disc version of Wrestlemania 23. Popped Volume 1 in my dvd player, wouldn't play, Popped Volume 3 in my dvd player, would not play. Disc 2 played from start to finish. Tried all 3 in different players in my house, same results. Amazon sent another copy, same exact result. Thanks Amazon for helping me out I'm sure it's a mfg. problem. Will try again at a later date."
5,WWE Wrestlemania 23,"Classic matches! enjoyed the WWE HOF Ceremony! I am a WWE fanatic.. was brought up w/ the WWF/WWE, so collecting the 3 disc sets of Wrestlemanias w/ the HOF Ceremonies brings a great smile to my face. a MUST for any WWE Fan!"
4,WWE WrestleMania 23 review,"The 8 way Money In The Bank ladder match was a high-flying,hard-hitting showstealer. The match between The Great Khali & Kane was slow & sloppy. The Chris Beniot-MVP-US title match was a high-tech,solid bout. The World's title match between The Undertaker & Batista was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth brawl. The 8 man tag team match between The ECW Originals & The New Breed was short but sweet. The Bobby Lashley-Umaga match was not great but pretty good with VKM & Donald Trump making the match at least entertaining. The Melina-Ashley-Lumberjill match for the Women's title was short,sloppy and dumb. The HBK-John Cena-WWE title match was a back-and-forth,entertaining,hard-hitting,high-flying bout. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
1,the worst wrestlemania ever ¡¡¡¡,"This is the worst wrestlemania ever, why ?, you got Kane vs Khali in a worst match, then the Money in the bank with 8 wrestlers ¡¡¡¡, the ring looked overcrowded.MVP vs Benoit: Not the big dealThe womens match: no care about itTAker vs Batista: Acceptable, but not greatCena vs HBK: Acceptable, but not great"
5,JOHN CENA AND UNDERTAKER TWO GREATEST WRESTLERS!!!!!!!,"1. WWE Championship John Cena vs Shawn MichaelsWinner : John Cena ( If HBK wins, I would not watch WWE again because HBK was one who screwed Bret Hart (one of my favorite superstar)2. World Heavyweright Championship Undertaker vs BatistaWinner : Undertaker or no-contest (If Batista wins, I would not watch WWE again because he sucks like HBK or Triple H)"
1,Second Worst Wrestlemania Of All Time,"This was LOUSY. This years Wrestlemania was so painful to watch that it hurt. There were TWO good matches. The opener Money in the Bank Ladder Match which was GREAT and Batista vs Undertaker which was GREAT. [...]. The main event between HBK and Cena was so bad I couldn't look. John Cena has won the third straight time. I don't care anymore, my best friend doesn't care anymore, I don't know if too much people care anymore about John Cena. Make someone else the star now that he's been shoved down our throats for three straight Mania main events.MITB = GREATTaker/Tista = GREATEverything else = [...]"
3,smackdown was insulted again,"i am tired of the disrespect shown to smack down. why in the hell did they have the taker - tista match SO early. come on. this was meant 2 b the last match. did hbk win the rumble? NOPE. it was taker. as far as im concerned the main event is aobut the winner of the royal rumble. it ws also painful to watch the beating cena took from hbk. don't get me wrong... im a chain gang member but cena got his butt kicked big time. last wm the same shtick. cena vs hhh. did hhh win the royal rumble? no, it was mysterio. come on wwe... smackdown deserves respect.also this mania can't b compared to the greatness of wm22. this mania had lame matches like the kane - khali and the wwe womens match. i mean come on. so manyh wrestlers left out. specially cryme tyme. so many watches that should've been added but no... wwe had to waste so much time in the battle of the rich bastards."
2,Accurate Review,"Ugh, I can't believe people are saying that Wrestlemania was great. It was OK. I'm selling my copy in the near future. I mean Cena, Batista, and Khali all had to be carried in their matches because they all suck. The womens match was crap.1. Money in the Bank is always good plus it had some cool spots.2. Kane and Khali was short and the only thing good about the match is it didn't go for 20 minutes.3. Benoit and MVP was OK but it should have went longer.4. The ECW match had NO hardcore in it which is dissapointing. It was good while it lasted.... 6 minutes!5. The entrances in Lashley Vs Umaga was about long as the match itself plus they threw in all those other people to make the match interesting6. Batista Vs Undertaker was good but it definately wasn't the Match of the Year. If this is the MOTY then wrestling sucks now.7. The womens match was a waste of time.8. Cena and Michaels was good but of course Shawn made it good."
3,Only 1 good match here bad wrestlemania,"The only good match is of course hair vs hair. Kinda humor and good. All other match too short except main event, which is very long but not great finish."
2,"Literate, Schmiterate","What you need is a tenor with gonads. These canticles rank among my favorite works by any composer, and I do like Bostridge sometimes, but I can't stand the hooting around I hear on this disc. I mostly agree with the editorial review in the details, but not at all with its recommendation. I think the negatives far outweight the positives. Try the Hyperion release with Anthony Rolfe Johnson. It's also flawed, but far more satisfactory."
5,Love it,"I love that these magnets are so strong, holding a couple of full envelopes if need be. They are easy to manipulate and perfect for my fridge."
5,"Absolutely awesome, anointed, and blessed!!!!!!!!","I picked a copy of Mr. Campbells' project entitled "" I Need Your Spirit"". I have been blessed over and over again. It is so refreshing and anointied. God Bless you Lamar for your ministry."
5,This album is a blessing!,"This is an annointed album. Lamar Campbell has stepped up his ministry in his second album. The Spirit of Praise Choir's voices are so clear and emotion filled. The album has is songs that make you get up on the feet and jam, and it has songs where you can fall to your knees and worship. If you want a change of pace from Kirk Franklin & Hezekiah Walker, but still want to listen to some good youthful sounding gospel music this is an album to pick up. In my opinion this is the best gospel album of 1999."
1,"Very, Very Brief Overview of Speed Reading","This is the briefest of books on speed reading. Too brief!! There are much better books available, which cover all the aspects of faster reading. For example, Speed Reading Made Easy by Nila Blanton Smith. There are several good guides to faster reading available on the internet. A couple are from major universities. Actually, just understanding a few basic principles and reading as often as possible will increase your speed. Quantum reading did not even mention reading roadblocks such as regression.Please, save your money!"
4,A fast read that covers the basics,"I was impressed with this little book. In about 40 pages you'll pick up some great, basic tips that will help you improve your reading speed immediately. The book is very quick, interesting read. If your objective is to see some nice improvement in your reading speed without having to read a lengthy book on how to do it, this one is for you!"
2,"Almost decent for learning, but better for karaoke","This is an almost decent product. Mostly I was just impressed with how the musicians who played the instruments on the accompanying CD sound just like Coldplay. The only difference is that there is no Chris Martin vocals...So the first couple tracks are like karaoke.---But I was under the impression that there was also a set of tracks with no guitar at all, just bass and drum. This is not the case. There is just less guitar on the no guitar tracks. So if you want to play along with a band that sounds just like Coldplay to learn their songs, this is good. But even better for that purpose--- the actual Coldplay CD's.The string by string tuning track is helpful, but that's what a tuner is for-- or just tune to a song.If you own the albums, I would reccommend just buying the full album tab books for Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head and playing along with the actual recordings."
1,GOOD PRODUCT!! BAD DEAL!!,"I had originally bought this product with the intention of using it on my Win Vista computer. I checked the listing for the product and it did not mention which operating system it was compatible with so I trusted them. I even tried using it on my new Win 7 machine that I had subsequently gotten while I was waiting for this CD to arrive. It would not work there either. If you have a computer newer than Win XP, I would advise not buying this product."
1,Laughable,"In the south particularly, everyone is suddenly ""part Cherokee"". This book strikes me as uniformed about the culture he professes to be a part of. At times it is very close to even being insulting. It also slams the reader with true immaturity, and a great deal of fantasy. I suggest educating yourself with the true Cherokee story, not this nonsense."
3,Solid but not exciting,"I intend to use this book as the basis for a course, but I have to add quite a lot too it. It does not mention paraxial ray matrices, which are the method of choice for today's computer-oriented students. The problems generally don't require much initiative- mainly numerical substitutions in formulae. There are no experimental results (e.g photographs of images to show how well the theory really works). But the main developments are there and they are quite clear."
4,Entertaining by Cooking,"I liked HOW TO COOK A TART, so much so that I felt cheated that there wasn't more to it. Certainly, the food descriptions may be the best ever written for a non-cookbook, and the story is clever.Still, as it reaches its too-short ending, TART seems much like a pastiche, with a resolution far too reminiscent of Roald Dahl's famous murder mystery, interconnected relationships that are both implausible and derivative of Dickens in their frequency, and a final act of generosity between the spouses that smacks of O. Henry's ""Gift of the Magi.""Various fascinating subplots remain unexplored and unresolved, barely more than hints, particularly regarding the television show and the arrest, and how the latter impacts the former. (No, I'll give away no other details.)Nina Killham is a marvelous author. I look forward to her next novel, with the hope that she will correct these types of conceptual flaws in future stories."
3,"Better than average, but not amazing","This book had a lot of strong points. It was easy to get into, it had flowing prose, strong characters, and, of course, tons of fabulous food descriptions. I agreed with some of the points the main character, Jasmine, made about diets and dieting, and what they're doing to modern society. Denying yourself pleasure in one area of your life (namely, food) is only going to cause more problems in the other areas. I enjoyed the ending, and laughed out loud several times during the last chapter. However, despite the fact that the cover called it ""hilarious,"" I found little to laugh at throughout most of the book. A lot of it just seemed to showcase how cruel people, and particularly women, can be, starting from a young age. My advice to potential readers is that it's a book that's worth reading, but don't necessarily believe everything you hear about it."
2,Bad ending!!,"This book was decent all the way through until it got to the end, which was just disgusting. I would have probably given it four stars if the end hadn't been so bad."
4,"Good book, surprise ending","I thought this was a well written book and the description of the food was to die for. It would have been a surprise ending, but by reading reviews on this website I prematurely learned what would happen. I recommend that you DO NOT look at older reviews before reading unless you want spoilers, which I didn't."
3,Some people,"Some people take this book too seriously. I thought that it was a lot of fun. It is not a murder mystery! It is just a goofy yarn that was an easy read with a lot of meat (literally and figuratively) in it. The characters were meant to be what they were. They were stereotypical, but had quirks outside the box. Both my daughter and I enjoyed the ride and got some good laughs along the way."
3,Saucy,"This book got off to a strong start and was definitely believable. In the beginning, I found it to be witty, funny and well written. For an epicure, the descriptions of dishes prepared by the main character were tantalizing; but alas, something happened about 80% of the way through the book - it took a crazy and unbelievable turn for the worst. It was almost as if another writer stepped in to finish off the job. I would still recommend it as a light vacation read....but I was disappointed in the ending."
3,Left me with a bad taste,"I was enjoying this book until it took a turn for the worst. While everyone raves on and on about the food element of it, I found I couldn't get past the disgusting ending of it. I guess I was hoping that the characters and all their wacky food issues (which were quite entertaining) would somehow blend into a wonderful sauce at the end. Maybe I was just hungry by the time it was over."
1,Worst book I have read in awhile...,There is not much to say about this book- it was completely boring. The only good thing about it was Jasmine March's food descriptions. That is it and even those weren't enough to carry me through the story. And if you do start out partially enjoying it... the end will just ruin it for you anyway. Don't waste your time OR your money.
3,Not for the squeemish.,"I found this to be a good book. It was very well written. I am not one to give away the end of a book, but I would like to warn any prospective readers that the last few chapters are NOT for the squeemish as they contain cannibalism."
3,"Not bad, not great","While I enjoyed this book, I found parts to be improbable especially the ending which I was really disappointed with. However, the author's understanding of cooking and food were amazing."
5,Rods absolute best,"I know everybody cites ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" as his best.And while I agree that it is a great record,it pales(just a bit!)in comparison.Every song on this cd gets an A+ rating.Its worth purchasing just for his cover of Hendrixs' ""Angel"" alone.I actually think he does a better version of the song.The opening song ""True Blue"" is a balls-to-the wall rocker!Another favourite is the bluesy ""I'd Rather Go Blind"" very Stones-like.It all closes with ""Twistin The Night Away"".this being his original cover of the Sam Cooke classic,not the whimpy remake he did in the 80's.This is one essential release!"
1,disappointed,I am very disappointed with the tapes. There was only 2-3 minutes of information that I found useful. A lot of time was filled with common sense stuff.
1,Waste of money,"The design of this device is such that there is a larger than needed gap between the pool surface and the device, because the wheels are too big or mounted too low. So the large gap makes it so it doesn't do a very good job sucking things up. Returned."
5,Great,Good product. I used this for my dirty pool to clean waste out. Really good and heavy duty. Work done with it.
4,Solid heavy construction,Delivery was early - thank you Amazon. I opened the pool late so had a lot of immediate cleaning. Heavy design keeps the vacuum in contact with the on the floor. The base being a little higher that other vacuums allows removal of larger debris and also pulls in particles in suspension.
4,so so,"There are so many manufacturers of these things, it really doesnt' matter. They last 3 years tops before the sun eats the plastic up, or a roller falls off. Nature of the beast with need have a flexible base run the pool contours. This is as good they all get."
4,Good vacuum head,This is the best price for a comparable vacuum head for my style of pool. Locally the sellers were looking to charge much higher prices than I paid here.
5,Nice product.,Supplier shipped fast.A better product than available in the local Lowes/Home Depot. Nicely made and flexible enough to get into the corners and solidly built roller system. Exposed metal is all stainless and bearings are sealed. Hose attached securely. Doesn't seem flimsy. Still new but time will tell how long it lasts.Right now 5 stars.
5,Enter a dogs mind....,"I loved this book...being an animal lover, this book puts you into a dogs mind. It makes you really wonder what animals think and how they interpret what humans say. Excellent book."
4,Great Concept,"I think to really enjoy this you need to get into a very deep mind-set or have a warped sense of humor. At one point Aster takes this book to the extreme ends of imagination by taking our Canine Hero Mr. Bones into a vivid hallucination where he imagines himself as a housefly. To many this could be a bit much, but it is a refreshingly simple idea that makes for light hearted reading. I really enjoyed this book, it was different from anything I have read in the past, and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a change."
5,you get what you give,"At first Auster fans may wonder what's going on here...after the jazzy dazzle of his earlier works, he here presents a startlingly simple, prosaic tale. Has the master lost it? Not at all. In fact, the intuitive Auster reader will recognise exactly what he's up to. Possibly moreso than ever before he's playing with the roles of author and reader, examining how much of a novel comes from the creator and how much must come from us. This time the onus is really on us, like it is upon the main protagonist, Mr Bones, to make sense of everything, to find our way in the places where our master leaves us. `Timbuktu' is a book which is as interesting as you are. I got loads from it, and in this straightforward tale I'm actually finding more than I have in some of Auster's earlier labyrinths, but quite easily someone else may get nothing from it. Great literature demands that we be active, not passive, in our participation. This is great literature."
2,What a disappointment!,"After hearing a raving review on NPR and then reading the platitudes on Amazon.Com, this book was one of this year's biggest disappointments. Mr. Auster knows how to write, there's no doubt about that but his story tends to lag in places. When Mr. Bones was having dreams, why ever in the world did he have to totally rewrite, almost verbatium, the un-dream again? Being an animal lover, I was deeply disturbed with the ending. This book was definitely not my cup of tea. I would not recommend it to my reading group."
2,Sweet sentimentality burdened by simple and cliched writing,This book is half appealing and half annoying. Auster does not do any original writing and the first half is particularly cliche driven. Ultimately his character ( the dog) and it's situation are involving but the writing never reaches even a decent level of originality or insight.
3,"A slender, somewhat unsatisfying read","Mr Auster is truly one of the giants of contemporary american fiction, but I wonder if he hasn't missed the boat with this, his most recent foray into the novel. The premise seemed interesting enough: a homeless schizophrenic and his faithful companion, a veritable Sancho Panza and Don Quixote in rags, venture forth across the urban landscape in search of a long-lost friend to safe-keep a dying man's entrire literary output (what was in those notebooks? we never really find out as the disappear midway through the novel). Instead of exploring the mind of Willy G. Christmas (truly a character!) and the contents of his notebooks, we get a suburban slice-of-life tale complete with the textbook distant husband and unfulfilled wife and her precocious children. Only Mr. Bones unique narration, surpirizingly cerebral for a dog, saves this novel from being a complete wash.He might be coasting here, but Auster coasting is still better than most on a good day."
4,It's a dog's life.,"On page 52 of this book, Auster has his main human character say, ""You'll just have to bear with me as I ramble and digress."" The author could be speaking for himself. I write ""main human character,"" because the main character is Mr. Bones, a mixed breed, beyond middle-aged dog who loves his master, but also senses that his master is not long for this world. Mr. Bones is a remarkable animal. Of course he can not speak, but he can understand, probably because his companion is constantly carrying on a dialogue with the pooch. What we get in this charming little book are the thoughts of Mr. Bones as his situation in life takes dramatic turns. This is my second venture into the works of author Auster, and it will not be my last."
3,Why didn't it make me feel mushy inside?,"As a devoted animal lover, I was very excited to receive my copy of Timbuktu after seeing a brief but glowing review in my Sunday newspaper's Parade magazine. I waited to open its firm cover until I had a rainy Sunday afternoon to devote to the book. I hate to say that the book didn't tug at my emotions and pull me into its story like I hoped it would, but that's how I feel. I truly enjoyed reading it but was expecting more. Sure, a few times tears welled up in my eyes, but this book will soon be forgotten in my memory. Too bad! It could have been so much more!"
2,"It Can Only Be Described As ""Puppy Love""","While, I have first editions of virtually everything written by Auster, I resent having wasted my money on this one. It's, at best, a literary exercise in point of view. Honestly, who cares what Auster thinks a dog thinks. The narrator and the human characters were both dull and uneventful."
1,A book that barks but doesn't bite,"This is, by far, the worst book ever written by Paul Aster and (I hope) the worst he'll ever write. The question here is: What happened to the man who wrote ""The Invention of Solitude"" and ""Leviathan"" and the script of ""Smoke""? Answer: I'm afraid he was found roaming the streets by Lulu's Bridge (another big ugh!) and put to sleep. ""Timbuktu"" is --literally-- a dog of a book. And, yes, without testicles!"
2,The Voice and the Cliches,"As a fan of Auster's works (I liked NY Trilogy, In the Country of Last Things, Moon Palace, Invention of Solitude, Hand to Mouth), I went into this book fearing the worst. A couple of friends told me it wasn't very good, and they were unfortunately correct.The two most detrimental factors that contributed to the failure of this book are as follows:1) The fairy-tale-esque narrator voice. Mostly it's condescending, and very quickly it becomes annoying. I don't know what Auster was thinking, choosing this particular narrative style. It just doesn't work.2) Cliches. There's so much lazy writing in this novel -- just start counting the number of cliches Auster uses. It's criminal."
1,I threw it away to prevent anyone from reading,"After I was done with timbukto I felt worse off for having read the story. Rather then donate the book for someone else with different taste in books to find it I decided the best option would be destroy it so no one else would have to suffer.I found the story depressing, without meaning, and void of hope. Rather then continuing on with life you leave everyone behind and go out in the street and play in traffic."
1,Who Needs It?,"If your idea of a good read is being led down the path to a really sad ending, then this book is for you.First, I have to say I have never read any Auster before and I wouldn't have read this one if a friend hadn't insisted that I read it -- even knowing how I detest sad animal stories. She assured me that this wasn't sad. Wrong. Taken at its surface value, or taken as a metaphor for, say, life, it is deeply, deeply sad.The canine character is Mr. Bones, a sympathetic creation if ever there was one. He understands almost everything, is loyal and brave, endures the knowledge of his unattractiveness, and the pain of hunger and illness. At the end dies without self-pity or complaint. How's that for a jolly read? Anyone old enough to read this book knows that most animals have, undeservedly, an awful life. This book isn't entertainment -- it is torture."
4,an innovative take on the human condition,"This may not be Auster's most perfect novel, but he does such a good job with his characters that the book does have that quality of staying with you long after you close the last page. Even if you're not a dog lover, you have to relate to the way animals sometimes seem to understand just what we are saying. I agree that some of the middle of the book got stale, but several of the younger kids are well drawn which brought the interest right back. Even though the book seems like a light comedy at first, Auster has that knack of approaching world problems like homelessness, drugs, craziness, all through the back door, in this case, the comments of Mr. Bones, Willy's dog. It's quite a short book and probably would have made a better short story than a short novel, but still, I enjoyed it and found Auster's writing excellent."
3,Dog's Mind,Anything through a Dog's Mind is a worthy contemplation. Auster manages a satisfying narrative voice and a kind-of clean resolution of some difficult material. Enjoyable to read
5,"BELLO, LITERARIO, POETICO ,EXTRAORDINARIO !","ESTA NOVELA TAN HUMANA, TAN TIERNA, ES UN CLARO EJEMPLO DE LA ALTA CALIDAD LITERARIA DE PAUL AUSTER, QUIEN ES CAPAZ DE CONTARNOS UNA HISTORIA TAN BELLA, EN UNA FORMA TAN POETICA, Y DONDE EL MENSAJE DE AMOR SE ENCUENTRA EN CADA UNA DE SUS LINEAS.PARA LOS AMANTES DE LOS PERROS UN BELLO REGALO.

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND TENDER NOVEL FROM PAUL AUSTER.A BOOK WITH A DEEP LITERARY,POETIC,FULL OF LOVE,AND WITH A EXTRAORDINARY MESSAGE. PAUL AUSTER THE NEXT NOVEL PRIZE FOR UNITED STATES!"
3,Lacks bite,"Although Mr. Bones was a worthy protagonist in this book, his loyal companions were never quite engaging enough to justify being a dog's best friend. Willy's diatribes were a bit too much to handle, and his other caretakers were too cliched and forgettable.I appreciated Auster's approach to humanizing Mr. Bones while maintaining his canine sensibilities. However, I would have liked to have seen some resolution with Willy's plight to have his work/life recognized. The ending was pretty disappointing as well.All in all, it was an easy enough read, even though it lacked bite."
4,"A quick, enjoyable read","As I was reading Timbuktu I didn't find it very compelling (although as an animal lover I certainly enjoyed Mr. Bones), but toward the end and especially in retrospect I find myself reflecting on the story and Mr. Bones. It really is a touching story and Mr. Bones's insights into his human compansions are worthwhile. This was the first Paul Auster book I've read and I'm not sure if I will read another, but I would recommend Timbuktu to anyone that appreciates a sensitive and at times heartbreaking work."
3,Mixed Bag of Tricks,"I kept wanting to be knocked out by this book, but I just wasn't. Sentimentality didn't override scampered execution. As a dog owner with a very faithful pooch who also follows me everywhere I go without a leash, there were moments I really enjoyed, but this story just kept falling short of the mark.If you're not a dog lover, forget about it. You'll want to roll over and BE dead just a few pages in, yet there is something there for those of us who know the love of a good canine. It wouldn't be my first choice for a read, but Timbuktu doesn't come in dead last either."
4,"This book is funny, not just ""slender.""","While perhaps this is not one of Auster's most ambitious outings, it's still a great read. It avoids the self-seriousness of some of his more literary work. The choice of Mr. Bones as the narrator avoids being a gimmick due to the wonderful, wandering shape of the narrative and the dead-on insights.This book isn't perfect, but it's a true pleasure to read. You'll laugh out loud. You'll think.And this is yet another example of why you people at Amazon.com should stop using Kirkus, which is notorious for being snide and cutting; its reviews are written by failed writers for $30 a pop. Are you trying to sell books and cultivate readers or what?"
4,So Much for Conventional Wisdom,"Having read two of Auster's previous works throughout the last year or so, I was interested to see the reviews when Timbuktu came out. They were generally quite negative and I was surprised due to both my positive experience with Auster's work and the praise it usually received. So I held out, waited for the paperback and even that sat on my ""to read"" pile for a while.The major lesson learned here: don't let other reviews make up your mind for you. I am very pleased that I finally picked Timbuktu up and read it. It is a fine book, well written in a style that is almost conversational. The characters are rich (or as rich as they can be in a 180 page novel) and telling the story from the point of view of Mr. Bones was a fantastic idea.This might not go down as Auster's best, but its certainly worth the time and is a valuable addition to the Auster bibliography."
3,"What Say You, Mr. Bones?","Timbuktu is an enjoyable story told from the viewpoint of Mr. Bones, an unremarkable dog journeying through the human world. Mr. Bones seems the most sane and reasonable of the characters in the story. Through his eyes, we are treated to a spectrum of human behavior that should leave the reader wondering just what the heck we are doing.Webstral"
2,This dog thing didn't work.,"This reads as little more than a rough draft from start to finish. The stakes are low as can be. Don't get me wrong - I think Paul Auster's work can be so interesting, particularly The Invention Of Solitude, and his writing can be unsettling [not 'scary' unsettling, but 'I don't know up from down' unsettling].But this dog thing is wack. If this is your first time taking a peek at Paul Auster, skip that dog on the cover and go for the New York Trilogy or Invention Of Solitude.Dogs are cool, and dog interior monologues are cool, dog humor is cool, dogs who chill out with bums are cool - Timbuktu just isn't written very good."
4,"A Modern ""Lassie Come Home""","The book was about the pull of a comfortable but banal and restricted life in the mainstream, versus a free and colorful but uncomfortable life on the fringe of society. It was extremely well done. It only reminds me of ""Lassie Come Home"" because of the traveling dog, trying to survive and running into many different kinds of relationships with people."
4,Endearing and sweet,"Mr. Bones the dog and Willy the man, with a number of supporting characters, create this jambalaya of a reality check. Auster takes us through the backstreets of the United States and through the mapless streets of Willy's mind.Mr. Bones talks to us, consoles us and opens our hearts to the deep capacities of love, loyalty, and literally undying friendship. It is just that in this story the core of such sincerity is surrounded by unyielding madness.This is a quick read but don't underestimate time for satisfaction. It's a cure that hits the spot for a one or two afternoon dose of renewed faith in our vital and enduring tribal connection."
2,The language triumphs over all its other deficits.,"Why do I keep reading Paul Auster's books? Because despite the big disappointments in characters and how things turn out, his language just knocks me out. Some of it is just so delicious that I don't know if I could stand it if he actually maintained that level of virtuosity throughout a whole book. Although I couldn't stand how Timbuktu turned out, especially after Willy died, I did read it in one fell swoop. I do wish I hadn't bought it, though, but had checked it out from the library."
1,This books a dog,"The cover and premise are appealing and the driving sentiment is nice but the writing is surprisingly lame. This reads like a very young writers first attempt at breaking in to the bohemian ranks. Reread ""On The Road"" instead."
2,"Well Intentioned, but Poorly Executed","There is no question that Auster is a talented writer, but Timbuktu fails to add anything to his previous work. The word play is common and sometimes embarassingly obvious (as when the protagonist's owner turns Santa into Satan, or Dog into God), and much of the story feels improvised. In more than a few places you have to wonder if Auster knew where he was going at all. Still, much of the story is entertaining, and if you are able to get past the idea of a story told from inside the mind of a stray dog you may very well enjoy this book. For me it was a little bit predictable in its themes (there is more to life than material possessions among others) and felt front-heavy in its pacing.Bottom line: If you are new to Auster, read the New York Trilogy instead."
5,PROVACATIVE,"A SUBTLE EPILOG WHICH REMINDS ONE OF THE FORGOTTEN VALUES WHICH EMERGE LONG AFTER READING, WHICH ARE NOT APPARENT WHILE READING, WHICH HAVE BECOME STEROTYPES, SUCH AS COMMUNISISM, SOCIALISM,CAPITALISM, ETC.THERE IS A RESONANCE, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE, WHICH IS ERRIE THAT TRANSCENDS THE COMONPLACE BLATHER WE CORRODE OUR EXISTANCE WITH.REFLECTIVELY, VERY PROVOCATIVE.WILLIAM M. HALFORD"
2,This is very lightweight Paul Auster material.,"I read the Timbuktu reviews before buying the book, so I was prepared for a less-than-stellar Paul Auster novel. I wasn't disappointed. Timbuktu is superficial, marred by many cliche-riddled phrases. At times, the tone has the same sentimentality of a greeting card. The insights of the main character, Mr. Bones the dog, are interesting at times, but lack the profundity of the typical Auster protagonist. Mr. Bones' mentor, Willy G. Christmas, is boring, as are his rambling monologues. Aside from tepid interest in Mr. Bones, Timbuktu lacks characters to keep our interest. Because of the New York Trilogy, Leviathan and In the Country of Last Things, I remain a committed Auster fan. Here's hoping he regains top form for the next Millennium."
3,"Thought-provoking, but a little too stretched-out","One of the more original short works of fiction I've seen lately, Timbuktu will pull the heart-strings in all the right places. The idea is traditional, dog and man, but the actual storyline is one thought not traversed before. Putting yourself in the place of Mr. Bones made you think just a little bit more, and pay attention to little things you may have never before.The problem is, Auster stretches things out and dwells a little too long on flashbacks and details instead of the story. You don't actually get into the moving plot until the third-or-so chapter. Also, he could cut back on the cussing, not that it offends me, normally I don't mind, but it just stuck out like a sore thumb with all the other beautiful writing and made you cringe a bit too often.Overall, to say personally, I enjoyed it; but, for some, it might not be exactly what you're looking for, and it could be a lot more well-done."
1,A dying gasp,"This is a sad book, not because the characters and events in the book are sad, but because it reads like the dying gasp of great writer who has run out of things to say. There is not one idea or emotion conveyed in this novel that Auster has not already shared with his readers in his previous work. The point of view of a dog is nothing more than a cute contrivance, and hardly a page goes by without some tedious cliche being applied to the existential condition. Such a shame, really, reading this novel, after such wonderful and innovative works as the New York Trilogy, The Music of Chance, and Moon Palace. Luckily I only paid a dollar for it at a clearance counter at a used book store. Little did I know that it was there for a reason."
4,I continue to think about the book long finishing it.,"A very wonderful book for animal lovers. Auster, as the dog narrator, does a fantastic job of telling this dog's story. Mr. Bones simply accepts and deals with whatever sad hand is dealt to him. And he definitely falls on many hard times both before and after Willie's death. After reading Timbuktu, you will forever communicate with your dog on a more intelligent level! The monologues by Willie Christmas were usually long and boring. Just skip over them - there are the rantings of an idiot under-achiever. All of the people in the book are very real; you will know them all. Read Timbuktu - but take a Prozac before doing so."
1,An Instruction Booklet of Sumatran Dance for Beginners,"Very brief overview of Indonesian dances and brief instruction on Tari Piring Sedang Lawas (dance with candles) from Minangkabau, Sumatra. Don't expect gorgeous photos and instructions on Balinese dances. If you already know well about the dance, it may help to dance. If you never see the dance, it would give some vague images of the dance. Instruction of wearing costumes (long Kebaya of Sumatra) might be some use. Poor printing qualities and illustrations."
5,Great Find!,I heard about this book while traveling in Kenya but didn't want to purchase it there and have to carry it home. I was so happy to find it on Amazon. It's a lovely book with wonderful illustrations.
1,Huge Disappointment!,"We were all really excited about this train, but that excitement only lasted for as long as it took to set it up. The trains are adorable, but, unfortunately, they barely move around the track."
2,Two Units - Both Broke,"Purchased this original train set for my toddler kids. Easy to put together. Very beautifully constructed; however, by the end of the holiday season - the engine broke. Returned it and received a new product. The new product was also broken because it did not play the additional music cartridge with the Calliope Car. Also, as the train moves around the the track it is very LOUD and after a while gives you a headache. The remote works intermittently, in most cases - you need to be within 2-3 feet from the engine for it to work. We were disappointed and DO NOT recommend this product because of the surprising lack of quality and reliability."
5,"It's a Lionel, the best name in Trains","Great product, great service,, even great price. Ordered this train to place around our Christmas tree. Everyone who has seen it has remarked about how nice it is and how it brings back memories of the trains they had years ago. Lionel still makes quality products. I expect our great grand children to run this train under their Christmas tree many years from now. If you are shopping for a Christmas train, this is the one to buy."
1,"Nice looking, sounds dismal. Not Lionel Quality","I bought this train as a pre-sale special 5 months ago. It arrived this week to a very excited dad and son. Looking at it raised our expectations of Lionel quality. Once set up our hopes were dashed as the grinding gears and loud clicking of the contacts as they passed over the track joints. The train didn't seem to ""roll"" on the tracks as much as slide around. This clicking, sliding, metel to metal slide sounds destroy any ambience the train sounds try to generate. Every car truck has the spring loaded contacts which generate the majority of the sounds.VERY DISAPPOINTED, will not keep this set. Not what I expected from Lionel."
2,"Not Lionel quality, VERY loud","This train is not of Grandpa's Lionel Quality of the old years. While the pieces look great, They are soooo loud as to border on very annoying. The biggest disappointment was that the train engine actually died on us about a week into running the train."
1,The train is crap and so is Lionel train company.,"I purchased this train and it looks great and if it worked I would be happy. I called Lionel and they said ""sorry"" we don't fix them and they don't know of anyone that can. The woman I talked to said the G- Gauge was crap. I had a inexpensive Christmas train for many years when my kids were young and now I have grandchildren I had a little more to spend and I wish I didn't."
2,Selfish parenting,"I only got a few chapters in and could go no further. I am a new mother and love and lucky enough to spend nearly every waking hour with my baby. It is easy to see why she only has one child. She seems to have a totally warped, painful sense of parenthood, it is kind of sad. She mainly talks about herself. The cover portrays that one may find silly, funny, or realistic antidotes about parenting of little ones, this is not what is in the book. It is pretty much the parable of the burning bush of parenthood, beware."
1,Great book for over-privileged helicopter moms,"I was really excited to receive this book, having read that it would provide tips on how to be more contemplative during particularly challenging parenting moments. Once I started reading-& I forced myself to read the entire book-it seems more appropriate for moms who would love a book such as ""Eat, Pray, Love."" That is, a mom looking for pseudo-spirituality in hopes that her yoga friends and play group moms clique will find her to have depth."
2,Dissapointing,"There are only two songs on this entire CD that I recommned: ""8 Days of Christmas"" and ""Opera of the Bells."" 8 Days has a great dance beat, it just makes me wanna get up and dance! Opera shows off Destiny's Child's amazing vocal skills and harmony. The other songs do too, but their just not very good. The other songs I feel as if they're trying too hard to sound good. They should just sing naturally and it would be awesome. Don't buy this, it's only worth the two tracks."
2,Their Weakest Moment Since Album One...,"...is sadly this Christmas release, 8 Days of Christmas. Overdone vocal gymnastics tarnish most of the Christmas classics on this festive album. The holiday single ""8 Days of Christmas"" is an upbeat bright spot that leads to some overworked vocals by the talented, but overused Beyonce Knowles. Two of the best tracks are the ones that give Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams a short shot at the spotlight, giving beautiful renditions of ""Do You Hear What I Hear?"" and ""O Holy Night"". Beyonce, though an extremely talented woman, seems to be the main fault of this album. Diva behavior like her taking a writing credit for ""Silent Night"", and her lovely but obviously overused voice that does no good to the afformentioned carol. Song titles switches and subliminal doll advertisements are icing on the cake. Though this release had so much potential, it gets a so-so three, for the few redeemable tracks available here in."
2,"Bills, bills, bills Mr. and Mrs. Knowles?","Anemic. Poorly arranged. Disappointing. Sold it on E-bay. How many vowels are there in the words peace, silent, and night Beyonce? Pick a note. Why is there this current trend to take a single vowel up and down the scale? Sounds like they are tuning a piano."
2,Not worth the money,"Destiny's Child's ""The Writings on the Wall"" is one of my favorite CDs so I was really looking forward to their Christmas album. I was extremly disappointed. The first three songs are not bad, light-hearted little Christmas tunes with a funky beat. Things start to go bad though when the girls sing their own songs solo. As a trio they sound great, individually they leave a lot to be desired. I am not trained musically, but I do have an ear for what sounds good and what doesn't. All the traditional songs on this album are terrible, which is unfortunate because Silent Night, O' Holy Night and Little Drummer Boy are some of my favorite Christmas songs. If they had just sang the songs like they were meant to be sang without all the vocal aerobatics, it wouldn't be so painful to listen to. Save your money."
3,destiny's child 8 days of christmas is a descent christmas..,"destiny's child 8 days of christmas is a descent christmas albumand my favorite joints on the album is 8 days of christmas, the dc medley,platinum bells and others songs and it is a good christmas album for the holiday but it is not like their previous album survivor and other albums too and everybody please support destiny's child and we are fans of destiny's child so they will be happy"
2,"No, No, No","First, let me begin this review by letting everyone know that I am a fan of DC. I am not a ""hater"".I have to say that I was not pleased when I heard this cd. They're a wonderful trio. Each member is blessed with a beautiful voice; that's why I expected so much more out of this cd. ""Silent Night"" and ""Opera of the Bells"" are my favorite.....everything else is just plain horrible. I understand that they wanted(or maybe Beyonce) to jazz it up a little....update the classics for 2001 and beyond. Whatever the case, it didn't work out. I agree with the Amazon.com review. It seems as though this cd was ""forced, chilled, and overdone"". Their version of Donny Hathaway's ""This Christmas"" was just horrible. I really felt that had they stuck with the traditional arrangements of the songs, spice it up with a little DC flavor, it would have been a beautiful cd to enjoy."
2,Stick to the traditional girls..............,"I have to say that I was disappointed with this cd. I am soo grateful that I burned it instead of wasting my money. Before the fans attack me, just keep in mind that I am a DC fan too!!! However, I will NOT jump on the bandwagon and say that this was a wonderful Christmas cd. They need to stick with the traditional tunes. It's a shame; their voices are beautiful. They harmonize well...........but I really believe that they got carried away with this cd. The only song that I feel is worth listening to is ""Silent Night"". It was beautiful. Other than that, I see no reason to purchase this cd. Please listen before you buy!"
1,Sorry I bought it.,I could not believe that anyone could ruin Christmas more than Scrooge but Destiny's Child Christmas CD has managed to do just that. The arrangement of the Christmas classic's are so bad that any attempt to sit through them made me long for the fast forward button on the CD player. Their voices have no harmony for the tempo. Had they done them in the manner they were meant it may have been a pleasurable CD. Instead I'm using it now as a coaster for my coffee table.
2,I'm Tired,"I'm tired of Beyonce's shrill whining. ""Do You Hear What I Hear"" is the only song worthy of a listen. Sorry, but gotta pass on this one!! Seems like this was thrown together to capitalize on their current popularity. Beyonce's mom, as fashion stylist is awesome; I watch the videos and TV appearances for that reason only."
2,Hmm..,"LOVE Beyonce and Destiny's Child, and had high hopes for this, but it really isn't up to their usual album standards..Maybe that's why this album isn't so well-known. Didn't love the production..Maybe it's just dated now. It definitely reflects how young in their career they were at the time! Nothing stood out to me, and if I'm not humming anything afterwards, that's always a bad sign. And Christmas albums are my fave..Disappointing."
4,"The ""best"" days of Christmas!","This CD by Destiny's Child was wonderful. I was expecting before I purchased it that I was going to love it. Destiny's Child was my favorite group back in the 90's when they were still singing. I loved their creative twists on songs such as Silent Night, A ""DC"" Christmas Medley, and Opera of the Bells (sang A Capella). The CD was fun to listen too and got me into the holiday spirit. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes R&B music and is looking for a little holiday cheer."
3,Not Horrible (3 1/2 stars),"At first I didn't really like this CD. I only bought it because it was on sale for $6, but the more I listened to it, the more it grew on me a bit.Cons:- Some of the arrangements do not compliment the holiday season and they sound bland (""Platinum Bells"", ""White Christmas"").- Some of the lyrics are ridiculous (""But this year the dolls are you and me"", ""It's Christmas time with the Churren"")Pros:- These girls can sing and their harmonizing is beautiful. (""Opera of the Bells"", title track),- Each of the girls have solo songs on this CD, which is nice to see because it showcases their individuality. (""Silent night"", ""Do You Hear What I Hear"", ""O Holy Night"")- Some of the tracks are really fun (""Winter Paradise"" - which creatively samples George Michael's ""Father Figure"" - and ""A DC Christmas Medley"".)Overall, this CD is actually a nice listen during the holiday season. Check it out."
4,Destiny's Childs X-Mas album,"I can't agree with most people that gave this album 3 stars. It is Christmas and what a nice change to hear ""old"" music in a new format. Great Album, Great Group. Enjoy the album. Happy Holidays to all."
1,What a disapointment!,"I'll have to admit that, I have not been a listener of Destinys Child. I was watching them perform on NBC while they lit the tree in Rockefeller Center. I overheard them sing Opera of the Bells and was so totally revulsed by that performance that I had to see if the rest of their album was as horrible. It was. It is obvious that this group of performers is quite talented, although they take artistic creativity to a new low. This collection of Christmas music is by far the worst that I heard in some time."
1,PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISN'T DESTINY'S CHILD!!!!!,"OK, FIRST OFF I WANT TO TELL EVERYONE THAT I AM A DESTINY'S CHILD FAN, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS ALBUM IS TERRIBLE!...I RECOMMEND CHRISTINA AGUILERA'S CHRISTMAS CD INSTEAD. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE EDITORS REVIEW; THIS ALBUM IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!..."
3,Not exactly a Christmas Favorite,"This album is basically a ""Pop""-ed up version of Christmas favorites. Most of them I can't listen too. BUT...Their version of ""Carol of the Bells"" Named Opera of the Bells. IS GORGEOUS! The harmonizing is absolutely wonderful. I had never cared for Carol of the Bells, but their version is gorgeous. I just have to CRANK my stereo and just envelop myself in the harmonies. If anything, get this song!"
4,I still play this album every Christmas season!,"Some 3 years later, I still play this album! Destiny's Child made a nice Christmas album, full of spirit and enthusiasm. Each of the girls take a turn in singing lead on the songs, whether on group or individual songs. I love Doesn't It Feel Like Christmas and the familiar Christmas songs. Silent Night sounds superb. There are a few R&B/hip-hop inspired beats in some of these songs, which makes this sound different. This will be just as much a classic as the Christmas albums of the past."
1,Shocking!,"Shocked! That's all I can say. I was shocked when I heard this CD. And appalled! This CD is absolutely dreadful. They should have been ashamed to put garbage like this on the market, at such a joyous time of the year. This CD is further proof of how much talent this group possess... ZERO!"
2,Not My Style!!!!!!!!,"I'm sorry but this album was not what I expected. I didn't like how they remixed the chirstmas songs. I'm returning this , and I'm going to purchased Mariah Carey's christmas album."
1,this CD is horrible,it's like survivor with lyrics about the christmas holiday season. Stick to survivor instead and get a real christmas album like whitney's one wish.
1,Yikes,"I love Destiny's Child and songs like Lose My Breath, but for a Christmas album, this simply misses it.. Save your money and buy Merry Christmas by Mariah Carey and you'll see what I mean."
1,Ugggghh!!,"I can't believe DC is trying to pass this off as a Christmas album!! I mean come on, making a new album is one thing but to put it under the guise of a christmas album... tasteless! Don't waste your money... I didn't thank goodness, listen to the demo's and you'll see for yourself. I'd rather hear my dog belt out some tunes than this."
3,It' ...............Good,"Destiny's child cd 8 days of christmas was just good nothing more nothing less. Beyonce and Kelly sound great, i dont know what michelle was doing. 8 days of christmas is good, but opera of the bells is my favorite song on the ablum. Well i bought this cd because I have brought every single one of their cds , and this one is decent . Poeple go out an help support dc3, buy the cd!"
3,Destiny's Christmas: Jingle All The Way,"I like this CD. OK, every track is not a slam-dunk, but there is enough here for everyone. They handle the traditional material the best, and I pick these four cuts as the strongest:* Do You Hear What I Hear* Silent Night* O' Holy Night* Opera of the BellsGive these young girls some credit. They are getting better and deserve some respect. This album is an obvious attempt to broaden their appeal. Compared to the Supremes very early in their career, this CD is comparable.If you listen closely to the songs, the girls CAN sing. The stuff with a more hip-hop edge on this Christmas CD is admittedly not the strongest material, but their hardcore fans will probably like it.On the strength of the four tracks I listed above, go ahead and get the CD!"
1,save your money!,"That Eight Days of Christmas track really says it all about this shallow,tacky, soul-less drivel. Also, I admire her, but Beyonce needs to stop working on blue jeans and become a better musician. You can always tell a song she's written because her melodies and choruses are limited to the same four repetetive notes. See if the 8 days doesn't sound just like Independent Woman. Seriously. Why is she afraid to use the whole scale?"
1,why?,I enjoy the Destiny's Child sound so looked forward to their holiday CD. If they had just done the classic songs in the manner they are meant to be done they would have made beautiful music. Instead it was a horrible mix. It was almost painful to the ears and bordered on disrespectful of what the holiday means to most people. A real disappointment. The star spangled banner and the classic holiday songs - why can't people learn not to mess with them?
1,Love Destiny's Child- Hate this album!!!,"I've loved Destiny's Child sice their first album back in 1998. I still love them now- Michelle and Beyoncé's debut singles are excellent. But I can honestly say that this album is utter rubbish. I was mortified to hear how bad DC had done- why oh why did they release this dismal collection?Nothing's 100% original and it all sounds way too sugary and light. Perhaps if they'd done a gospel Christmas album it would of been better.The only song I kinda liked was the 8 Days of X-mas song, but it wasn't on the high standard of the songs on Survivor.I'm sorry to say IT'S NOT WORTH IT!"
3,Ho Hum,Kind of lack luster. Lots of pages in blue and white. Didn't get into enough detail on the things I actually went looking for.
2,Good ... but useless for VisSim 4.x,"... and actually just because the book is a printed (old) version of the now as PDF included manual. Though not identical, but very similar. Too similar to spend [a large amount of money]. (The book is actually software ... VisSim2.0 Student)On a positive note, there is a rebate offer for future purchases of VisSim software in the book over [a large amount of money]. (In case you intend to spend at least [an enormous amount of money] on the real thing.)From a year 2002 point of view: This book is old and not recommended unless you need a printed copy and a freely ditributable version of VisSim (old though).That leaves the interested reader with a problem: There is virtually no literature available geared towards VisSim."
3,girls gone wild ultimate spring break,"it is what it is. I have come to the conclusion that pornography is a waste of time, the spirit and money"
1,I Love my DS (?),"I can not understand that nobody told the publisher that the 'Designer Shock' design crew copied the work of Brittain based 'Designers Republic' Everything, and I mean everything inside is a straight copy of more or less old work of the Designers Republic. It is a bit sorry."
4,Great Intro to the spirit of Capoeira,"The is the best capoeira video I've ever seen (but there are not a lot of capoeira videos availible in the US). Even though ""Jogo de Capoeira"" focuses on Bira Almeida's (Mestre Acordeon) Capoeira Arts Cafe in Berkeley, it is a great documentary about the game of capoeira and what is means to be a capoeirista.People from other martial arts often don't understand why someone might to a handstand in the middle of what they percieve as a fight. Get this video if you want to understand why.This video won't teach you any capoeira moves. It will help both the capoeirista and non-capoeirista understand why people play capoeira, why they sing the capoiera songs, and why people live capoeira.Get this video if you want to better understand what is in a capoeirista's heart and mind..."
2,more like a documentary,"I bought this tape thinking that it would be an instructional tape, but it more like a capoeira documentary, so if you are interested in learning capoeira techniques this is not the one for you."
4,Love the size.,I bought this for my New Year's Eve Party. I loved the size and how easy it was to control the temperature of the oil. It worked well but my husband was concerned with how the cord/plug was made. I hope what he thought won't come true because this is only my second fondue pot and my first one is still working.
5,A new New Year's tradition has been started!,- easy to use- large enough to easily feed 8 people- looks great- safe - magnetic detachment of cord so detaches if someone walks into it
4,Fan of Electric,"After having some ""mishaps"" with sterno, buying an electric fondue pot seemed right up my alley. I read the reviews and decided on this Cuisinart. We have used it at least 5 times already. It is easy to use as well as easy to clean up. I have to agree the temperature settings are very hot, I never have to go past 2 (3 starts to boil). So not sure why they do that (practically could use as a crockpot with those temps). I love it for the safety (no flame, we have a young child who enjoys melted cheese:) For the price, I would recommend. I also bought Great Party Fondues book by Peggy Fallon with it. Great book, tried 4 recipes all of them pretty good!"
1,Bad Description,"I was satisfied with the product as I used to have a similar one.However, in the description of the product in Amazon there was nothing mentioning that it was 110 Volts what really turned to be disappointing as in Hong Kong the electic voltage is 220V.I think you should improve the description of the item to avoid other people to make the same mistake.Thanks,"
3,Way too short.,"As most of the earlier reviewers have mentioned the electrical cord provided is so short as to render the fondue pot unusable without an extension cord. But, the instructions state that an extension cord should not be used with it! Of course everyone is going to ignore this bit of warning. The real concern would be using an extension cord that is not heavy-duty enough. But use of an appropriately heavy-duty cord will give your fondue meal or party an interesting industrial look.Other than this electrical cord flaw, we really enjoy using this product, yellow heavy-duty extension cord and all."
1,Just a piece of junk,"As mentioned in other reviews, this item is both poorly designed and manufactured. The heating elements are non-linear in their function and heat only a small area of the very bottom of the thin aluminum pot. The sides of the pot only get warm while the base boils the cheese. Worse, the temperature difference encourages superheating of bottom fluid resulting in frequent eruptions of hot fluid being spewed from the pot. While the non-stick surface is a good idea, the metal forks will quickly score it and cause the Teflon to peel off-- a less than delicious food additive. It should have the kinds of plastic utensils usually used for non-stick cookware. While I have two other fine Cuisinart appliances, this one is just a piece of junk. We used it once and returned it-- thankfully Amazon has an excellent return policy and procedure!"
4,Voltage?,"Hi,can somebody tell me if this Fondue Maker works on 100/240v ?? i'm from belgium, so this information it's really important for a good working of this item.Thank you all ;-)"
4,Yum!,We love this fondue pot and have used it for cheese and chocolate. It seems to get VERY hot though so its usually on 2 or 3. You would probably only use those hotter settings for oil or broth for cooking meat.
4,good food-good friends,Had fondue at our new years eve party & it was a success! Guests complimented me all night long on how much fun they were having using the fondue maker
4,Very Nice,I have only used mine once but my Brother has one and has had very good experience with it. Good value for the cost.
5,Great way to fondue!,"This is a wonderful little appliance. We have already used it and it was so easy to make fondue - you actually cook it in the pot, then just turn the heat down when it's done. It keeps it at the perfect temperture and you don't have to worry about sterno (if you have an old fashioned pot you know what that is!) Did I mention you can throw it in the dishwasher and it's non-stick? It's fabulous!"
5,Phenomenal fondue pot!,"We knew we wanted a pot that was electric this time and given the reviews, I felt it worth buying. We've tried all manner of fondue in it now and just LOVE IT!!!!!! Easy to work with, easy to clean and feel solid and sturdy. I'm going to buy another for a gift. Excellent product and quality!"
4,safe fondue,At christmas time the night before the holiday we have the family over and have oil cooked meat and shrimp fondue with a side salad and oreo cookie cake for dessert. We have now acquired 2 cuisinart cfp-3ss electric fondue pots because they are safer to use than the open flame heaters we have used in the past. We also found that they are more convenient as we no longer need to heat on the stove then move to the table as everything can be done at the table.The grand kids loved it although they loved to talk about the time a few years ago when the alcohol overflowed the heating container and grandpa had to carry the flaming pot to the kitchen sink where it was put out and the shower part of the sink was used to put out the fire on the floor where the burning alcohol had landed. Less exciting but still a wonderful time was had by all.
5,Everything the reviews said!,Beef sirloin fondue had been the special Christmas meal for years. Bought the Cuisinart because of the larger size and the ring to hold the forks. Was an ample size for seven people and cleaned up like a dream.
4,"Fun, easy way to do dinner","Love everything about the product, except the short cord.Dishwasher safe is a major plus, makes for easy clean up."
4,Perfect size for 6-person family,My family have used this for 3 types of fondue in the past week. It heats up the dipping chocolate and boils the stock quickly. Super easy to clean. I only wish it would come with a lid.
5,Fondue Party,"I purchased this to help celebrate Valentine's Day with my Granddaughters. We had chocolate fondue with strawberries, angel food cake, graham crackers. It was a lot of fun and very easy to clean up. Loved it and I think my granddaughters enjoyed it also."
5,Not just for fondue...,"This is a very well made fondue pot. The cord is very short, but I use an extension cord even though they say not to. I use this fondue pot mostly for other things like heating up soup, sauces, and any liquid food like that. You can even cook with it. The food also stays warm until dinner time. It's kind of like having another stove top element and saucepan."
5,fondue pot of the future,"After using old sterno can fondue pots for 30 years, this one takes the cake. Itkeeps the temperature just perfect for hours - no fussing with sterno cans. Clean up is so easy with the non-stick surface and if you are worried about the cord hanging over the edge of the table (getting tripped on or pulled by a young child), don't worry - they made an easy release/magnetic connection so that it cannot be pulled over. You may need an extension cord depending on where your nearest outlet it. We even used it outside this summer for appetizers at the cabin - perfect!"
3,Good for oil and broth fondue or hot pot with one exception,"I'd like to first say that this pot is NOT good for cheese or chocolate fondue. Can you make it in here? Yes. Is it bad? No. But it couldn't be more different from using a proper cast iron cheese fondue pot. Don't make the mistake I did by thinking that I could get an all-in-one! If you are a cheese lover you'll want to invest in a separate cast iron pot.With that out of the way, this is a great pot for oil or broth fondues or asian hot pot with one exception - the heating mechanism is not sensitive enough. The liquid is either at a boil or nothing at all. Even though the temperature control goes from one to eight I can never get the liquid at a steady simmer. Even set at three or four it's in a full boil, if I turn it down to 2 there's no simmer whatsoever."
4,Excellent!,"Good little fondue pot for $50. It heats just a little unevenly with the area closest to the power source being slightly warmer, but it's not so bad that it creates a problem. Just keep an eye on it. The forks are sturdy, and don't bend easily. The cord that plugs into the wall connects to the power source with a magnet, and can sometimes fall off, but in the long run I like this feature even though it can be annoying at times. Better this than someone tripping on the cord and pulling the whole pot with its contents onto themselves. The nonstick feature works very well for both chocolate and cheese. I originally saw this exact same model at Bed Bath & Beyond for ten dollars more, but decided to check Amazon for it before I bought it. Glad I did."
3,"Nice Read, worth your time","This was my first, but will not be my last, novel by Thomas McGuane. Frank Copenhaver, the central character, has hit a rough patch in his life. His anchors have left him. In the opening scene he is taking his wife to the airport. She is leaving him. After some brief background info, McGuane lays before us a man who's life is torn out from underhim and who doesn't really seem to know how to get back on track. Ultimately it is a story of betrayal, love and relationships. Husband and wife and daughter. In between there are great descriptions of Montana flyfishing. Although not as good as The Shipping News by Annie Proulx, this book does come pretty close."
4,Pleasing blend of traditional music and current pop styles,"Okay, I'll admit it. I only bought the CD because Cyndi Lauper did some work on it. But I was surprisingly entertained by the rest of the tracks. The CD features a collection of artists (including Joan Osborne and members of the Hooters). The tracks are catchy and thought-provoking, and are a refreshing departure from typical pop fare. My favorites include ""Freedom Ride"" (an upbeat Hooters-esque song with an Irish influence), ""Medallion"" (a folk song about a Turkish cab driver living in the States) and ""Cyrus in the Moonlight"" (a slow ballad about a man lamenting the fact that he must choose between two women). I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes any of the above-mentioned artists, or who likes songs that blend traditional cultural motifs with current themes and song structure."
4,A terrific stroll through a variety of American styles,"_Largo_ takes a simple, but lovely melody and shows how flexible it is when treated like blues, rock, ballad, and instrumental. Each song is independent, but family resemblances exist given the common parentage -- Dvorak's Largo motif. Especially haunting are the songs Cyndi Lauper and Joan Osborne each perform on. Another gem is the application of _The Star-Spangled Banner_ to the Largo theme at the beginning of ""Medallion"" before the switch into an original song. Great talents. Great creativity. A novel concept that actually works."
1,IS THIS RICHIE OR HARRY CONNICK JR.?????????,"This is not Richie Sambora from Bon Jovi, nor is it Richie from his last solo album ""Stranger In This Town."" This album is horrible and most of the songs sound like they should be sung by Sting. What is the point or direction of this album? I do not get it, somebody please explain it to me. Where is my guitar hero? Where are the killer riffs and solos at? Most of the music is softer than Mariah Carey and most of his singing sounds like he is on his knees crying out to the Heavens above, trying his best to sound like her too. Ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Another Great CD,"Although this album is not as great as the under-rated masterpeice ""stranger in this town"" , this is a great album full of soulfull tunes and great smooth bluesy guitar work. release more albums richie ...!!!"
5,I think Richie is a Fabulous Singer,"About six years ago, I saw Bon Jovi in concert at Star Lake in Pittsburgh. And he was great!! Then after the concert he played at a small local bar. I thought it was really great that such a great performer would do this. Any ways, he reached down and handed me his guitar pick and shook my hand!!! I still have that pick and I will always cherish it!!! This cd is great and very relaxing!!! I think Richie has alot going for himself!! He is a great guitar player!!!! I would love to see him in concert again!!!!"
4,SOULSKINNER!!!!,"I picked up this album after i heard the song soulskinner, which is the best song on the album. They are one of my top favorite death metal bands, comming close to the almighty cannibal corpse. Fleshcrawl is not quite as gorish as one might think, but they are still quite fun to listen to."
3,FLESHCRAWL,"Fleshcrawl is another great band to come from Metal Blade Records. It reminds a little of Dismember in brutalness and the vocals are heavy. There is even a Judas Priest cover METAL GODS. This band is underated and should be more well known then some bands that don't deserve the credit like(Nile,Origin,Dying Fetus,Skinless)come to mind as being overrated and quite boring."
2,Don't waste your time,"Title says it all. Weak, weak, weak. Plenty of good movies out there to watch....don't waste your time on this junk."
2,2 stars for Hayden Panettiere,"I only give this movie 2 stars because of Hayden Panettiere was in the movie. Otherwise, this is a 1 star movie.This movie isn't as good I thought it would be. It had a good story line, but the movie just wasn't done well. There wasn't any memorable moments that I could remember. The jokes were kind of dull. The movie was kind of boring. The main stars just seemed to get there way too easy. Then, at the end they end of together and that is that.No one should ever buy this movie, and this one is a rental at best."
4,Pretty Well done worth Buying,Lots of these are not worth buying but this one does as directed by Chris Columbus who has many hits. Hayden Panterrieand her her friends hook up with smart but goofy Paul Rust and his buddy . Well done as usual by Chris Columbus.
3,Reliabe Vendor,I would purchase from this seller again based on the quality of teh product and that it arrived ahead of schedule.
3,A movie has never been made that was dumber.,"The plot sucks. Hayden is the only one that actually delivers a decent performance. The rest of the acting is tragic. There is teen drinking. Teen sexual inuendos. The movie rates at the highest B rated level. Regardless of all the horrible things I could say ... the movie has some fun chuckle moments. The 'awww' moments are adorable. It is a fun ""coming of age"" flick. So... rent it and enjoy it. Watch it for the laughs. To see a movie that truly defines the generation... but to buy it? I do not think so..."
5,Love this movie.,Great teen romantic comedy. The plot is predictable but the funny moments gets you through the experience with a smile on your face. Beth Cooper is every boy's high school crush they wished they had kissed.
2,A little too goofy to be worth watching again,"The story is ridiculous, and the comedic value doesn't make up for what it lacks. I found myself rolling my eyes, and bored to tears waiting for it to be over. The story never found its footing and was lost in slapstick situations. I would pass on this movie."
1,Beyond Redemption,"The movie was a total waste of time. There were numerous opportunities to reveal more of the characters' fine lines, but NO. This film does not merit a ""Bad"" rating, so save your time and go rent something on a DVD. And I'm not writing any more reviews that require more than 8 words. It's two thumbs down for ""I LOVE YOU BETH COOPER.'."
1,Avoid this movie,"So. The first minute of this film was great. Guy telling everybody about his long time crush on a girl he never even talked to. It's all downhill from there though.The movie goes back and forth between being extremely goofy and very serious. This is something I've seen in A LOT of movies but it never seize to confuse me. How on earth am I supposed to take the characters seriously after having seen them act out like cartoon figures the scene before? It would be as if Donald Duck all of sudden started to discuss Sartre's influence over western existensialism with Chip and Dale right after an ADHD like fight.Even so, the movie is really bad. Avoid."
1,I don't know why I wasted my time,"I love you, Beth Cooper is supposed to be a big hearted comedy. Well, I didn't think so. I thought it was a terrible movie that, only had two likable characters. The acting, for the most part, was pretty bad. I might of giggled a few times throughout this movie."
5,Great!,"Our cat sleeps on this at night, and doesn't seem to mind the crinkly fabric inside of it. We use it with the snuggle safe--the snuggle safe stays warmer longer when underneath the pad, and helps warm the pad more."
1,Hardly Heats At All,"I was disappointed with this cushion and will definitely return it. It's possible that I got a defective one, but it barely heats up--I'd say it warms only by one to two degrees--not nearly what I expected nor what a product that calls itself ""self-warming"" should deliver."
3,Crinkly noise scares the cat,"It warms fine but when the cat steps on it the crinkly noise scares him away, so it's not useful for us."
2,too noisy,"My cats hate the noise this makes when they step on it. I've tried it in various spots but they take a step onto it and it makes a crinkling noise and they go elsewhere.It's soft enough, and looks fine ... for a cat that doesn't mind the noise maybe it's good."
2,Disappointing,I was really disappointed with the cushion. My cat won't sit on it because of the crinkling noise it makes when she steps on it--catnip didn't even work. And it didn't seem to warm up very much when I used it.
5,Pet thermal mat,My cat loves this mat! It has a crinkly material inside that attracts her and also adds extra warmth for naps.
2,Self-warming thermal cat cushion,"My cat does not like this mat at all because it crinkles (makes noise) when she steps on it. Unfortunately, this noise scares her away. And believe me this noise is pretty noticeable even for me. I do not think that it was a smart idea to put such a fabric inside. Overall, the pad looks nice but that noise... Have not decided what to do with the product and regret I did not read all reviews carefully."
2,"cat pad crackles, looks nice","this may be a great item, but my cat runs away at the crackling sound and has not deigned to sit on it. i will return it or pass it on to a friend with a dog. it is a very attractive pad, and could be of use to a human. i bought it for my cat, though, that's why only 2 stars."
2,Does not heat up,"I was hoping this product would at least heat up a little because I have one cat that always seem to be cold. Although she did lie on it a couple of times, I would notice that it would not get warm. I would touch the cushion as soon as my cat would get up and I did not notice a difference in heat from this product compared to a standard blanket. Also, my cat was scared to get on it in the first place because of the crunchy sound it would make. Overall I say you are better off just buying some warm blankets for kitty."
4,"Hot bottom! I love it, but the kitten hates it!","Well, I have to say, I think the product is a great idea. I love the fabric, and if you sit on it on a cold day, it really will heat you up. Unfortunalty, I didn't buy it for myself. The problem, according to Lucy, is that it crinkles (makes noise) when you step on it, and it scares her! Pretty silly. I am hoping that in the future she will use it. If not, my mom is getting a pug puppy, and I am sure she will love it!"
2,Thermal Cat- Cushions were so disappointing!,"When I saw these self-warming thermal cat cushions, I was so excited. We have two outdoor cats and I thought this would be so neat to keep them warm in the winter. I ordered two. My cats were terrified of them because of the crinkling like noise they made every time one of the cats tried to approach them. We could not believe that anyone that knows anything about cats would not realize that cats or other animals would not fear a strange noise. We wanted them to work so badly but the cats would walk way around them to avoid them. We put one of the cats directly on the cushion hoping to persuade him. He fleed in terror. We just packaged it back up and sent it back. If you buy one of these self-warming cat cushions, please be aware that it is quite noisy!"
3,powerful topic: execution?,"I read this book as a compulsory action for the 'Poetry of Rap' course in which I am currently enrolled at a major university. As a narrative and dialectic of black culture, or rather a single faction of black culture, this book is powerful and informative, providing analysis of many, many social thinkers of the Black Arts and later movements as well as Rose's perspective(s) on the developments of the culture. However, the execution of this text, ostensibly an academic account, is weakened by a diffuse structure, imprecise diction (beyond that necessitated by dealing with a topic heretofore untreated in academic circles with any rigor) and atrocious editing. I highly recommend the text, but by the same token recommend it with a disclaimer: hear why she says, and not what she says."
3,ok,"I like this artist but I didn't realize that after framing, the poster would be too large for the space."
2,Little more than a list of ships.,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this one. Not only does the author (who happens to be German) make totally unnecessary (and very unprofessional!) side-swipes at the British Royal Navy in a book about the US Navy, but when it come down to specific ships I found the information sadly lacking. In one instance, for example, the ""Service History"" of one vessel was a mere 17 words. Not enough.In another instance we are advised to read certain magazine articles written by the author to compliment what appears in this book. The fact that those articles were in the German language and were, therefore, published in Germany leaves me somewhat perplexed.These publishers are a leading authority on books about Ships and Shipping and I felt let down by this book. Nevertheless, it is a useful list of most (though not all!) types of US Aircraft Carrier and in many ways I can see how it could well be a good place to start that all-important research.NM"
4,Good service,"Arrived safe in a good quality hard paper envelope and with an amazing price. It took a while to ship, but that's was fault of brazilian Mail that start a strike last month.I recommend! Thanks guys."
2,An unwelcome course change,"This CD marks a major change in direction for Threshold, and not a welcome one. Prior to this release, Threshold established themselves as one of the leading bands in progressive metal. Here, however, they bowed to the dictates of fashion, producing a downbeat modern-metal album. On their earlier releases, Threshold's music was highly distinctive and original, with layers of heavy guitar and keyboards, and soaring vocal melodies. Here, they imitated the formula developed by other bands, with down-tuned guitars, sparser instrumentation and unrelentingly grim vocal lines. Similarly, on their earlier releases, Threshold's music was thoughtful, reflective and often quite uplifting. Here, they followed the cliché of creating an atmosphere of pervasive gloom and foreboding. By comparison, most of Threshold's other CDs are five-star releases. Recommended titles include their 1993 debut Wounded Land, along with the more recent Hypothetical, Critical Mass and Subsurface."
3,A funny thing happened on the way to the studio...,"First let me say that previous to ""Dead Reckoning"" I considered Threshold to be my favorite group/music, but something is missing with this CD. Maybe it's the absence of Jon Jeary and Nick Midson combined, that finally account for the lack of grandeur and epic qualities in the songwriting that defined Threshold's music over their past four CD's. This isn't a bad effort, but it doesn't have anything that reaches out and grabs you like their previous releases did. I really looked forward to hearing this CD and now that I have, I'm left bored and disappointed."
5,Quality Prog Rock,"Wake up U.S... Like previously mentioned, Threshold is an enjoyable listen. The Quality of songs, singer, musicians are as good as it gets. If you are looking for a Progressive Rock/Metal band who stays up with the times of Songwriting/Composing without going off the deep end like D. Theater has on occasion, then introduce your ears to the incredible artistry of Threshold."
4,A Place Called Freedom,"As usual for Ken Follett, this book takes you into the horrors of life as it once was for coal miners and the poor who were subject to those with the money. The events at time seemed far fetched but made for a very good, well written read."
2,A Place called Freedom,I was disappointed in the book because it was so predictable and not as well written as some of his other books.
4,A Place called Freedom,"The story had a lot of ressearch done to make it believable, unfortunately the last pages were a bit far fetched and made the ending predictable but the whole book was entertaining."
1,Could Ken Follett really have written this book?,"I generally LOVE Ken Follett books for their content, history and thorough descriptions of inviting stories. Thought I had picked up a Danielle Steele novel. Very predictable!! The only thing that was left out was the color of Mack's eyes. The plot was there, but it was not one of Ken's better books. Lizzie came across as a headstrong, too independent, spoiled, rich kid and Mack as her ever-faithful, always there (even in the strangest places), ridiculous hero. Makes for a quick read, but unfortunately not one that is memorable."
2,Misspellings Don't Work for Me,"Loved the book, but was disappointed in the number (25) of misspellings and incorrect word usage. Very distracting from the story. NOT what I expected from Ken Follett and certainly not from an Amazon book!"
4,another good book from follett,"this book is another winner by a great aothor.it has good characters that are real and likeable. its not as great as pillars of the earth or a dangerous fortune,but its very enjoyable."
4,A GOOD BOOK,"This is another good book by Follet. Though not in the league of ""the pillars of the earth"",""night over water""etc....it still holds you.A story from a bye gone era.. This enthralls you, read it if you are a follet fan.I dont miss his books at all, as i am a die ... of Follet. Anything he writes i will devour religiously."
3,"Utterly unremarkable, mediocre novel","I've never read a lot of Ken Follett's work. His two historical fiction novels, World Without End and Pillars of the Earth picqued my interest and led me to delve a little deeper into his earlier efforts. I must say after reading this novel that I was quite disappointed.A Place Called Freedom is at best quite mediocre. There is virtually nothing to recommend it above hundreds of other similar books. There were flashes of interest concerning mining conditions and southern plantation practices in the mid-18th century, but by and large it was utterly unremarkable.Hard working, ambitious, intelligent Scottish miner, spends 400 pages being attracted to a young open minded highly sexed heiress both in Scotland and over seas in pre-revolutionary America. I wonder how it ends?"
2,Why such a dull effort,"While I think it would be difficult for Follett to top a few of his own previous works, this novel falls far short of what I would have expected from such a detail-oriented writer.The hardcover book was misleading by its sheer size, since one might expect a deep, intense story to unwind over seven or eight hundred pages. It's actually less than four hundred. The jacket also teased me with visions of a long epic spanning several decades, as Follett did so brilliantly with ""The Pillars of the Earth,"" or as in the style of Michener with any one of his books.As I ploughed through the pages, I kept waiting for a surprise situation to develop. As mentioned by other reviewers, the book is highly predictable, and contains a lot of flat action narrative that I guess is supposed to excite the reader. By the last twenty or so pages, the book had gotten ridiculous and I was skimming over it all just to get it over with.This book is totally forgettable. What a shame."
3,Forced Freedom,All of Follett's books are good (I haven't read Hammer:)) It seemed like Follett tried to match the recipe from Pillars but it didn't work. Aa little romance is good but this was too much for me. The story lacked punch.
4,Good read,"Suspenseful, enjoyable read. Not what I would consider to be typical Ken Follett, but a look back at America when..."
4,place called freedom,"i always enjoy reading stories by ken follett. this was a great story, well told. i have read many of his books and have yet to find one that is not worth the time to read and enjoy."
5,A Place Called Freedom matched my expectations for a Ken Follett read.,I have never been disappointed in a novel by Ken Follett and A Place Called Freedom once again entertained and enlightened me all at the same time with a good story line.
4,Short but good read,"Short book, good story. I'd place Follett in the running with William Martin, Preston Douglas and Lincoln Child. Being of celtic origin myself I enjoy reading about the beginnings of my heritage and Diana Gabaldon has the best series in that respect. Follett's research is excellent and tracing a scotsman from his origin to the american indians and a new life in America is an interesting and fast paced read. You won't regret reading this book - but move quickly into Pillars of the Earth and World Without End - they are beyond excellent."
3,Not bad ... but when you think what it COULD have been ...,"A Place Called Freedom could have been a triumph for KenFollett. Instead, it's an OK book ... a light, breezy read,but nothing special. It reads like a Cliff's Notes versionof a great novel ... relationships and histories betweencharacters are hinted at, alluded to, even stated ... butnot explored. Characters come and go with little reason andless effect on the plot. Just as an example, the maincharacter's twin sister ... his rock, his best friend, hismotivation for escaping servitude, is killed. Her death andits impact is covered off in a few lines. The twoprotagonists knew each other as children (we're told) ...she the blueblood, he the son of the servant ... and yetthis early relationship is unexplored, despite its obviousresonance through the later meetings. It's like Follettphoned this one in, doubly disappointing when you read - asin Pillars of the Earth - what this author is capable ofdoing when he sets his mind to it."
1,Another's work under the name of Follett?,"At best this is a Harlequin romance .... it's hard to believe that Ken Follett wrote such trash. Although the historical aspects were interesting, the story was very predictable."
3,Not his best!,"Ken Follett has been an extraordinary author in my book but I was disappointed in this one. His mixture of history, adventure, sex and triumph in this book was just like every other sex/adventure/blah/boring book out there."
3,APCF review,Typical storytelling from Follett........entertaining and interesting......author must do considerable research on the times and history of each area involved.........ending a little weak but overall good
4,A Place Called Freedom,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. As usual, Follet does a beautiful job blending history and fiction. I highly recommend it."
2,Poor Finish,"This book started out by building up strong characters and had the potential to become a good story. It did not fulfill this potential. The tale turned into a poorly written romance. The ending was truncaded as if the author had to finish it in a hurry or lost interest in writing it. Furthermore, the kindle edition is poorly edited with far too many typing errors."
5,Another Follett trophy!,"On the heels of ""Pillars of the Earth"" and a ""Dangerous Fortune"", I was somewhat skeptical that Follett could do it again, but he did! Follett gets a hat-trick with his latest novel, which recounts the hapless tale of two 16th Century Scot oppressed and enslaved orphans. This book has something for everyone: Intrigue, suspense, romance, lust, greed, betrayal and misery...and that's only the first chapter!Follett is a master at painting pictures with words and this a ""must read"" for anyone who enjoys historical fiction."
4,Average Follett,"I thoroughly enjoyed Dangerous Forutnue and hoped this book would have the same effect. It doesn't quite reach that level, but still is a captivating story. The picture of lower class life in Eighteenth Century England is a compelling backdrop for a good story. The ending seemed a little too fantastic (reminded me of a Robert Ludlum finish) in that all the loose ends were brought to a successful conclusion for the star crossed lovers. But on the whole, I would recommend this to any who have enjoyed Follett's previous work."
3,Slightly disappointing,"I really liked the premise of this book. The story was engaging, however, it felt rushed and I didn't feel the characters were as well developed as they could have been. Follett provides no details on about the trip to Virginia except basically say, ""It was really hard and everyone was weak."" Perhaps because I read Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, which were both about twice as long and incredible in the level of details given of all the characters and stoires, I expected more of this book by Follett.Still, it's a nice read...just feels a bit rushed."
3,Engaging historical romance,"""A Place Called Freedom"" is a good book, not a great one reminiscent of the works of other very popular yet lighter weight authors. The story kept me interested but seemed somewhat watered-down when compared with other Ken Follett titles. A good one to read on the beach or on a plane."
3,"No Pillars of the Earth, but a breezy, if predictable, read.","I found this story to be rather over-ripe and predictable, but it kept me turning the pages. Something not previously noted by this reader in Follett's work, a rather pedantic, even patronizing attitude towards the reader. Follett seems to write the way the army teaches its instructors to teach: 1. Tell them what you're going to say 2. Say it 3. tell them what you just said. Well, DUH...."
3,Nice Read,"Not in the same category as 'world without end' or 'pillars of the earth', but still decent read if not spectacular"
3,Good Story But...,"I really like Follett's writtings but I thought this one was lacking in depth and discription as compared to some of his other historical fiction. To me it was to ""hurried"" , like he was meeting a deadline instead of allowing us to be absorbed in this story."
3,Scotland-London-America,"This book is less original than the other good Follett-novels.But still, it is enjoyable.A standard family-saga from the daysbefore American Independence, taking you from the coal-mines of Scotlandto 18-th century pubs of London and finally to the last days ofbritish rule in the american colony of Virginia."
4,Interesting historical read,I enjoyed this one. The life of the Scottish miners must have been hell. Very interesting characters characters and plot. Hard to put down.
5,Great Historical Fiction,"Ever since I read Pillars of the Earth, Ken Follett has been one of my favorite authors. All of his stories are filled with the human elements of history. This story set before the revolutionary war for independece is captivating and informative."
1,Nice words do not compensate a poor plot,"I finished the book, felt like saying that if this was a film, there would be a 1 1/2 star for it. The images this book gave me were incomplete, simplistic.The plot is poor, the situations created poor in design.The characters were false looking, trying to make something out of young men and women that does not make sense.All these chapters in America are badly plotted. You can already see the end coming.Selling a book with somebody's name (Ken Follett) is exactly what was done here."
2,"Disappointing, and not very satisifying.","I am a BIG Ken Follett fan. I actually met him here in Boston while he was prompting ""The Pillars of the Earth"". He's a very nice man, and excellant writer, but ""A Place Called Freedom"" started off with good intentions and fizzled out."
2,A Place Of Freedom by Ken Follett,"I was very disappointed in this book. Very Light. Very predictable. Read like, what I imagine, a Danielle Steele novel might read."
5,review,I really liked this book. I found the characters and the plot to be very interesting and attention holding also
5,Negotiate with kids...,I think this puts it right to the point about how to negotiate with kids. You can't do B if you don't do A was the whole point of the book. The examples were good examples because it teaches kids that they can't do something if something else isn't done first.
5,A Masterpiece,"This album brings every emotion to the table. It has incredible energy along with very poignant moments. The short rendition of Amazing Grace is the best I've ever heard. This music will make you want to dance and celebrate. But mostly, it reaches deep into your soul and makes you want to cry. This is the best Rod Stewart album, nothing else comes close. Mandolin Wind and Reason to Believe are true classics that you rarely hear on the radio. The short guitar intro to Maggie May is soooo pure and innocent. The light hearted tempo of Maggie May becomes a tear jerking classic when Rod sings some of the best lyrics in Rock n Roll history. After a failed romance, I remember singing this song. I know, I'm not the only one."
5,Good Classics Never Die,"This Cd is probably one of Rod Stewart's best works. Containing hits like the title track, Every Picture Tells A Story, Maggie May, and I know I'm Losing You, it is a must for every die hard Rod Stewart fan. Of course, with it being digitally remastered, the songs are better than ever. This also contains the song Amazing Grace as a hidden track.All in all, this is a great album and the fold out of the cd contains a picture of Rod Stewart singing in concert.Granted, the lights are obscuring his face a little bit, but the main focus of the picture is his back end."
5,Rod's Best album is a Masterpiece - one of the best ever,"Rod Stewart / Every Picture Tells a Story: This is one of the greatest albums of all time. Every song here is magnificently done and each song fits together so well as an album that this release has rarely been equaled. This deserves a Sixth Star. This is Highly Recommended.I have the MFSL Gold disc (which is a great CD) but since that CD has become so ridiculously overpriced, you are much better off with this fine remastered CD."
5,"My body stunk, but I kept my funk","Most critics say that this is Rod Stewart's best album, and I'm inclined to agree with them. It starts with the great ""Every Picture Tells a Story"", ends with the superb ""Reason to Believe"" and has a bunch of fine songs in between them. What more need be said? Highly recommended."
3,"Is it just me, or is the guitar out of tune?","You never know, Alicia Keys is intentionally flat on her new album, so maybe it was intentional, but the opening guitar was painfully out of key, and always seems like it's not quite in sync with the rest of the sound. If it wasn't for that, I might be able to evaluate this track based on the vocals and the rest of the sound. But the guitar is SO bad, I just can't focus on the rest!"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Moon Warriors was a huge disapointment. The story was terrible, the characters were uninteresting and the action was even worse. Don't let me even begin to start on the killer whale (filler)... If you want to see a good action movie try the Swordsman II, Iron Monkey, or Duel to the Death. Positive reviewers of this movie are probably guys that have never seen a hong kong movie that they didn't like."
2,dissapointing,"I gave this movie 2 stars,one for cinematography and the other for nice scenery,other than that this movie hasn't got much to offer.I was dissapointed the most after reading all the reviews about the great swordplay fighting scenes(they were horrid)I don't know what the reviewers were comparring the fights to but after I saw a sword play movie like FIRE DRAGON(a.k.a THE FIREY DRAGON KID) this movie is like watching a bunch of children waving sticks around and calling it action.If you were one of those people who gave this a great review for action than check out FIRE DRAGON and edit your reviews on MOON WARRIORS down a couple stars later."
3,"It was ok, but...","When I first saw the trailer for 'Moon Warriors' I was like ""Man! I got to have this movie!"". A couple of months later I found a used copy at a movie store and bought it right away. But after having watched the movie I have to say it didn't live up to my expectations. The main problem is that it's too slow paced - there's not enough action. And while there is some action from time to time, some of the scenes are a bit exaggerated (unless maybe if you happen to think that the stunts in 'crouching tiger,..' were realistic). Don't get me wrong now, I don't mind the use of wires, just as long as the characters don't keep flying through the air all the time a la 'Kung fu colt master'..."
2,Dissapointing,The stories in this book are interesting but the style in which they are presented is dissapointing. Too much editorialising which tends to become boring. They deserve a more dynamic presentation.
3,"Ok for the money, but...","Buyer Beware; This barn is sold by eToys which has a terrible record of customer service. The barn arrives with just two styrofoam inserts on either side in the box. If there is any rough handling then your barn will be reduced to tinder and good luck getting eToys to help. Once they've got your money they could care less what happens.

If that's how you want to be treated then buy from eToys.* when I wrote this review only e-toys was selling this. now there are other sellers too. -- Fall, 2008"
4,Big Barn,This Barn is huge. It does not come with the accessories shown. I bought the horses that were suggested and they were small. Much bigger horses can fit in the stalls. Kids on Christmas day loved to play with it. Very good deal for the price.
5,Good Buy,This is a great buy for the money. The horse stable is much bigger than I expected. I bought this for my six year old son for Christmas and he loves it.
5,Daughter loves it,"I got this for my daughter for her 5th birthday. It's quite large and seems pretty sturdy. It's roomy enough to accommodate the larger horses (or lots of small ones if your child doesn't mind the scale difference). Comparing it to the other barns, it's definitely a good deal."
4,wooden big barn/stable,This is an exceptionally large barn/stable for the money. Simple design and enough spaces to accommodate horses and human figures. Good overall purchase with no small pieces to step on.
5,great,This barn was more than I expected. I bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter. We love playing with it.
5,great value!,I thought I was misreading the price on this barn as I had been shopping around for a wooden toy barn and most cost over $100! This is well made and sturdy and we love the red roof. A great toy at a great value.
4,"Good product, could use more documentation","This power supply gives great, even power to the whole system. I only have two complaints:1) The only documentation in the box (and on BFG's website) is how to install the power supply. There's a ""Turbo Fan"" button on the back that is not explained anywhere. I've tried pushing it and all that happens is a blue light on the back of the power supply turns on. No noticable difference in fan speed can be felt or heard.2) Tied in with number one, it could use a cable to hook to the mobo power fan connector so you can monitor the fan speed. At least I then might be able to figure out what the button does.1/31/2008 edit- Found a person in a forum online that says the Turbo Fan button doubles the fan speed. If this is true, then its a pretty nice feature, especially since there's no noticeable change in volume."
5,When Frost Comes Home,"If Robert Frost were to live in rural New England today, this may be what he'd be writing. ""Town Roads,"" ""The Road Agent,"" ""A Row of Stones""-all there in the first few pages-are tributes to this New England sage. Although, I'm not sure ""Frostian"" is the only way I would classify Crawford's work. He hold strong to the old tradition of meter-something the world of today's poetry is missing (for without a tradition, it cannot be broken). In TOO MUCH EXPLANATION..., Crawford has reminded us that sonnets are not just for the classroom. ""French Braids,"" ""Exposed,"" and ""At the Top of the Stairs"" keep us grounded in our own familiar realm of erotic romance while retaining the skill of master's gone by. They are both sensual and classic. Furthermore, Crawford's ""When Boston Wins the Series"" (perhaps his signature work) is simply prophetic-a mantra that paid off when the book went to print.This is a work that can be appreciated by students and masters alike."
5,TRULY INSPIRATIONAL SOUNDS!!!!!!,"100% UPLIFTING!! 100% ROOTS AND CULTURE!! 100% POSITIVE VIBRATIONS!! 100% INSPIRATION!!It's been awhile since i've heard sounds like these. In the world of commercial music today this album would be considered alien. In a time of such travesty these musicians came true and real and despite their situation they remained positive and through their music passed on their stories to the listener. These song's aren't about girls, money, or status, yet these tunes are more powerful than anything on the radio right now. If you put this album on right at this instance, you'd be tapping your feet to the beats and you'd feel the positive energy through your body. Like listening to Bob Marley and the Wailers messages of injustice, war, freedom, and love. 100% TRUE."
2,Snore,"I ordered this because I grew up in that area of Western Wisconsin and I enjoy mysteries. I thought her characters were fairly uninteresting and undeveloped. I only got through the book by taking breaks and reading other books between chapters. Not the worst book I've read, but by far not the best, either."
4,Home territory...,"I love murder mysteries. As I started to read the book, I realised that it was about the area that I live in. This created a ""visual"" for me as I read the book. I have read other books similar, but it is so much fun to read any book when you can relate to the territory."
2,If you like elastic straps?,"The camisole was pretty, well made and everything except, this is nice only if you want and like the elastic straps. I bought this for my mother and didn't notice the straps in the photo. So she liked the camisole except for the elastic straps. They're marketed now as ""Built-Up Straps"" some have this elastic, some not, so look carefully at them. The camisoles without the elastic are fine and she kept those.Vanity Fair Women's Simply Special Camisole #17-720"
1,A long rant with little to no scholarly merit,"This book is a prime example of poor scholarship. Wiebe's complete lack of objectivity allows him to wantonly discredit movements which he sees as too radical or dangerous, as ineffective and laughably incomptent without citing any evidence to support his claims. His regurgitation of conventional knowledge is uninteresting, and when a point is made that is blatantly opinionated, Wiebe feels no need to back it up with any evidence. In short, this book is a gigantic waste of time."
1,how to destroy any interest in history,"by trying to read this book. Quoting another reviewer, the author is ""often guilty of over-generalizing, over-intellectualizing, & inundating his work with an excessive use of abstractions""."
4,Lenox paper towel holder,"This paper towel holder is sleek and graceful, the perfect compliment to your kitchen set. I thought it was beautiful, one of the thinks I like about it is that the little screw on cap is actually smaller than the hole in the paper towels, so the towels can just slip on and off without any fuss."
2,limited usefulness,"I received a bread making machine for Christmas last year and purchased this book on recommendation from a friend. The book is very limited to what types of machines it has recipes for. if you have a DAK/Welbilt, Hitachi, Panasonic/National, Maxim/Sanyo, or Regal/Zojirushi this book may be helpful. My machine is not one of these. I tried to use the recipes as indicated in the book for what I thought would be a comparable machine. It did not work at all. I salvaged what I could for the birds. I would not recommend this book unless you have one of the above listed machines and even then I have no idea if the recipes would work out."
2,Disappointed,"I tried at least seven recipes from this book. The only one that worked was a banana oatmeal bread. One problem was, the definition of a large zojirushi machine was one that makes a 1.5 lbs loaf, not a 2 lb loaf like MY large zojirushi.The too small loaves tended to bake in two heaps rather than one loaf, and often did not rise properly. Because they were so short, they did not brown properly on the top.The trouble shooting section was quite good, but it did not help the recipes in the book.I'd suggest Bread Machine Baking for All Seasons by Connie Merydith, if you can get it. Even though the recipes came in several sizes, they all worked."
5,A bread machine book for the bread connoisseur,"Despite all of the other bread machine books I've perused and used, this remains my favorite. Unlike most of the other machine books, which seem to present an endless litany of ""whole wheat bread, white bread, cinnamon bread..."" this book strays from that narrow path to offer treats such as Toblerone Chocolate Bread and machine versions of some of the traditional ethnic breads from the writer's childhood. If you're looking for recipes that are definitely not ""run of the mill"" - you'll find them here. In addition, the general information on machine baking, and how it differs from ""traditional"" baking, is extremely helpful. The writer clearly is a BREAD baker who enjoys using a bread machine, not a ""newbie"" bread machine baker, and her love for her subject, as well as her wide-ranging knowledge, shines through."
2,disappointing,"I am an avid bread machine baker (my family hasn't purchased a loaf of bread in almost a year). I read many outstanding reviews of Lora Brody's book, but I must say that I have been very disappointed with the results from the recipes in this book. The book opens with one fabulous recipe (buttermilk maple white bread). The other very good recipe is the one for honey whole wheat bread. But the others that I have tried have all fizzled. The balance of ingredients has not been right. Even after hovering over the machine during the mixing and kneading cycles, I still end up with loaves that are dense or dry or uneven. Since I have not experienced these things with recipes from other sources, I believe that the recipes are at fault."
4,perfect - just was i was lookimg for...,"perfect - just was i was looking for this version, as it is much better, and there is an audio CD that follows the book (i already had the CD) but the new version of the book didnt have any supplemental info... it was a lot cheaper route than getting the book with the CD as part of the ""Traveltalk Hindi & Urdu: Traveler's Survival Kit (Hindi Edition)"" -- this is the exact same book that comes in that kit."
3,Different Lucia!!!!,"Natalie Dessay's voice is quite remarkably similar to Eva Mei's which can be heard from Tancredi(starring with Bulgarian Mezzo Kasarova) and I Capuleti ci Monteccbi and Belcanto arias CD(all released from RCA VICTOR).With Bulgarian soprano Edita Gruberova and Korean soprano Sumi Jo, all of them share one common talent(superb coloratura skill).However, you should not expect high coloratura singing from this CD(all modified into something different!).For that merit, I prefer an Italian version better than this French version . Also Italian version is more dramatic."
3,"Overrated, overpriced. Please dont buy","Azzaro the King! NOT..... Super lame over hype. Generic alcohol smell, not a yves or D&G. Please do not blind buy, you will be wasting your money. It is for older men(40 and up)"
5,Azzaro for men,This is my husbands favorite. Will absolutely buy again. It is somewhat difficult to find in department stores so was delighted to find it here
1,No Nozzle spray on bottle,"The bottle came in good packing, but when I opened it, the nozzle spray was missing...totally useless. I had to return it and now I cannot order the replacement as the price has shot up by 50%...too bad!"
1,Rancho RS5128 RS500 Gas Shock Absorber,I ordered this set and the rear set for my truck at the same time. The other set for the rear fit perfectly and was easy to install. This was the wrong set. It didn't fit my truck I had to send them back and get a refund for them. It was like they'd put the wrong set in the wrong box because it didn't even look remotely close to the correct part and it didn't match the box either. That being said I had absolutely no problems returning them and the customer service representive was very helpful and sent a shipping label for it to be sent back. And I was refunded my money very quickly.M. Foster
1,CARMEN SANDIEGO JUNIOR DETECTIVE,"Does not work with Windows Vista as stated. It's not compatible and won't install. If it doesn't work, then it's pretty much useless."
5,God helps those who help themselves,Wonderful book. I would recommend this book to anyone needing guidance and learning to heal. This is an awesome book I only wish it came in ebook format.
4,Great Stain,"I bought this to stain some checker pieces that I was making for a handmade checkers board that I had. While the pieces ended up looking great, it wasn't as dark as I imagined it would be. I had to apply a few coats until I was satisfied."
4,It is a wood finish.,I don't have a lot of experience with different typed of wood finish but i bought this to finish a little wooden box i ordered. Worked great. Did what I needed it to do.
4,Atmospheric Bliss,"My introduction to Chroma Key came several years ago kind of backwards via Kevin Moore's other project OSI. I liked what I heard then and recently decided to see what else I could find. You Go Now is one of two I ordered.Others have mentioned that this album is the perfect accompaniment to a road trip, and it is. The atmospherics imbue the listener with a sense of relaxation which takes the tension out of a long drive. I pretty much enjoy the whole album, but my favorites are Get Back In the Car which sets the mood, followed by Another Permanent Address, the literally spacy Lunar, and Astronaut Down.I would recommend You Go Now to anyone who has enjoyed other Chroma Key releases or the heavier offerings of O.S.I. The CD comes with a flimsy but informative insert containing lyrics and pertinent album information. Check this out, it's great!"
5,Outstanding synthesizer instrumental work,"Outstanding synthesizer instrumental work by wizard Larry Fast who does all the composing, playing, and sequencing. You may recognize his name from sessions with other famous names, including Peter Gabriel. His first album, Electronic Realizations for Rock Orchestra, is sheer genius. I'm not sure why he gave it that title, though, since there is neither rock nor orchestra involved. Based entirely on electronics, with a wide scope of styles within the electronic realm, offering a colorful and melodic robust symphonic approach. Generally well composed and involving. As with most electronic music, the emphasis is on the texture and atmosphere, to which I think he succeeds admirably. An incredible tour-de-force of symphonic synth and mellotron. Among the original songs is a cover of the theme from ""Slaughter On Tenth Avenue"", which is one of the best. Synth fans take note."
4,Great Picnic Blanket,"Great picnic blanket. The bottom lining not only keeps the moisture out, but it also provides an extra cushion for more comfort. Nice large size easily fits a family of 5. The blanket folds up easily & the strap is adjustable for anyone to carry it easily."
1,Low quality materials,"Bought this Picnic Blanket about 18 months ago.Used it 2, maybe 3 times.The backing is already falling apart. Poor quality, very disappointed."
1,A waste of time for the tinnitus sufferer,"This book is a confusing mess of anectdotal remedies for tinnitus. If you can decipher what this guy is saying and come up with a treatment plan, more power to you. It's worth a look only because of its low price, otherwise the serious tinnitus sufferer should just pass this one by."
2,Not worth the paper it is printed on!,"Got this book to get some answers. Found nothing useful. A lot of high-level technical jargon, based on what the author did. Think my particular condition is due to taking 3 BP medications, since I first noticed it after getting a pacemaker. So I have to choose (live with it or die). A VERY SHORT BOOK. Good luck."
1,NO HELP.. I ALREADY KNOW WHAT THIS BOOK TELLS ME,RUNS ON TO MUCH DETAIL AND CONFUSING EXPLANATIONS AND WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO TO GET RID OF THIS PROBLEM. A WAISTE OF TIME AND MONEY. DO NOT RECOMEND.
4,"Fun, creative storyline","Let's head off to the Middle East and engage in mystery towns, archaelogical digs and intelligence entrepreneurs who impress local tribes to help overthrow the peace of the land...thanks Solo and Kuraykin are here."
1,"""NOT"" the goth band gODHEAD",This is NOT the goth band gODHEAD. This a bunch rednecks who try to write humores metal songs about being from the south.
4,Sing along game,"My 3 1/2 year old absolutely loves this game. She likes to sing the song and the pieces are just the right size for her. Some of the cardboard ducks can be a little flimsy but we've had great fun with this game as a family. I also like the fact that the game is short and winning is ""luck of the duck"" so it helps us as parents work on good sportsmanship while playing multiple times so everyone can win."
4,2 year old review,"My daughter really loves to play this game. I like it because it teaches her to take turns with other kids. As well as teaches her colors, its a short game so we can give all the kids a chance to win because it a game of luck."
2,Whitewash,"Reader beware: a whitewash of Irish (and English) martyrdom under the Tudor dynasty, with a decidedly pro-Scots- Irish bent throughout. While occasionally informative, far better reads include:1. ""The Irish Race in the Past and the Present,"" by the Rev. Aug. J. Thébaud;2. ""Church and state in Tudor Ireland; a history of penal laws against Irish Catholics, 1534-1603,"" by Robert Dudley Edwards; 3. ""Oliver Plunkett in His Own Words"" by Desmond Forristal."
5,Awesome,"Trevor Jones is the composer to the music in this film. If you recall he co-composed the music to The Last of the Mohicans and the two have a similar theme. Cliffhangers main theme is used through out the score as a romantic piece and as an action cue. Trevor Jones has done a great job on his scores. I would also recommend picking up Last of the Mohicans, Thirteen days, and From Hell as he has composed these as well. Awesome you won't regret getting this."
4,Great Main Title Theme,"I saw just the last few minutes of ""Cliffhanger"" recently, then the credits and listened to the main title theme. I immediately went online to Amazon and bought the CD. Great music. The 'internal' music is fairly generic, but the ""Cliffhanger"" theme and main title music are outstanding. Broad, heroic melodic theme, just enough brass and percussion to be inspiring without being obnoxious."
3,Difficult Lids and Sizes of Bowls,"Because the news media warned against using plastic to heat food in the microwave, I have purchased two different sets of Pyrex and am very happy with one of the sets, but this one is not as convenient because of the lids and the sizes of the bowls. I didn't think I was going to get the lid off the smallest of the bowls after storing food in it. I don't feel I can use the lids with the vent mechanism because of not using plastic in the microwave so that pretty much negates the use of the lids for that purpose. Also the size of the bowls is not that useful, either. I have yet to use the divided dish because of its size and because the bowls are more shallow than tall it is more difficult to get a grip on them with potholders when removing them from the microwave. The set is okay but I definitely would not buy it again."
5,Pulls no punches fighting creationist ignorance,Plimer does a great job demolishing the pathetic arguments of creationists in general and Gish in particular. I wish more defenders of science and knowledge would take the gloves off when attacking know-nothing creationists.
1,Absolutely Pathetic From Beginning to End,"The author, Plimer, is the one who is a master at telling lies. For instance, he speaks of the anteater on the Ark needing a supply of ants. Ask any zookeeper and learn tbat anteaters can be switched to common foods. There are so many falsehoods in Plimer's book that one would have to write a full book in response. So pathetic is Plimer that some of his fellow atheists have distanced themselves from him. Ironically, however, he won the Humanist of the Year Award."
1,A Joke. Period,"There are too many falsehoods in this book to even start describing them, and the fact that relatively-responsible atheists have repudiated this piece of trash is telling in itself. Those paranoid about creationists ""forcing their views on others"" must realize that it is militant atheists, and not creationists, who are trying to use the law to silence Christian expression and to remove every trace of anything religious from public life."
1,Absurdities on Top of Absurdities on Top of Absurdities,"Ian Plimer portrays his book as a defense of reason. What an abysmal farce! Plimer knows almost nothing of what he is talking about. In his book, for instance, he speaks of visiting Halvorsens, an Australian boatbuilding firm, about what it would take to construct a giant wooden ship (Noah's Ark), and alleges that he got an ""Are you crazy?"" look. Using the same foolish reasoning, Plimer should visit a modern concrete-making firm and ask how it would be like to erect the pyramids using only hand tools. I doubt if they would be too thrilled with the prospect either. As for those reviewers, and Plimer himself, who fear alleged creationist political successes, they need not worry. Creationists promise to be benevolent enough to let you choose the kind of wood the stake is made of on which you will be burned. So rest easy."
5,A Compelling Docu-Drama of the UFO Phenomenon,"Abduction In My Life is an excellent book for those who are interested in UFOs and want to learn more, as well be drawn into one man's quest for the truth. The main character, a writer, begins by seemingly pulling at one of the loose threads on the sleeve of reality : The UFO phenomenon, but by the time he is done he watches as the whole fabric of his life comes unraveled. The journey of this character leads him though the history of the UFO phenomenon in a sometimes quasi-documentary fashion, and into the peculiar phenomenon of alien abduction. It is at that point that he discovers a terrible secret that will forever change his life. Always informative and at times quite gripping, Abduction in My Life is a valuable addition to the growing body of the fiction about the UFO phenomenon. I highly recommend this book, especially to those who wish be entertained while receiving a short course in UFOlogy."
4,"Beautiful, but length a little misleading","This anklet is much more beautiful in person, than the extreme closeup shows. It is sturdy, yet dainty, and the white gold beads really sparkle. I would warn the buyer, however, that the 10"" advertised length includes a one-inch length of weaker extender chain. The actual length of the sturdy beaded part is only 9"". So, if you are wanting to wear it without ever taking it off, and you may want to measure your ankle before buying to decide if this is actually the anklet for you."
2,This is the wrong book!,"The publishers and Stephen Hawking evidently think they are reprinting Galileo's famous book supporting the Copernican viewpoint, ""Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems"". Instead, they've given us ""Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences"", a magnificent book (I use it as a text in my Galileo and Einstein course, see my website) BUT this book has nothing to say about planets or Copernicus -- the furthest object from earth in this book is a cannonball in flight! It's a five star book, but not if you want to find out what Galileo thought of Copernicus..."
3,I wish Galileo had put some interesting drawing...,"instead of dialogue only. I have not read entire book, but the preview of the book was boring. I like the picture description better than word description. I realized Galileo could not draw his theories directly, instead he let us imagine it by reading his words, because the church would have given him ultimate punishment if he did."
3,Mediocore,"This was the only book i could find on the land cruiser lj70 2.4TD, it has som very good descriptions of the engine and engine related parts, but i found it seriously lacking in the electronics department. There are som good diagrams, but no pictures, or descriptions of the electronics."
1,Not the best,"Not the best, did help with info needed, but did a better job with info from internet searches. Could recomend it if the pictures and diagrams is what you are looking for. The maintenance, tune-up & electrical diagrams is very small, really battles to read everything."
4,Nice Solid Glove,"This glove is not only a good looking glove but durable. My only complaint is that the closure around the wrist is an inch and a half longer than cycling gloves typically are. The extra length covering the wrist is fairly comfortable but very hot, soaking the gloves in sweat in all but the coldest rides. I wear full finger gloves year round for the added protection and sweaty hand have not been an issue in the past. Buy this stylish glove, wear it in the winter and keep it in the closet when it is warm."
4,microwave review,"Well I like it. I like the control panel. I can set up lots of auto timing with it, Which means all I have to do is punch one button. It took a little learning form the intruction book, but I got the hang of it.I think it's a great deal for the money."
5,Haier Microwave,"I had some reluctance ordering this unit because of the low price however it has proven very reliable. It meets all the basic functions and has a all the expected preset options. The stainless steel finish is nice and overall construction is good. For the money this is an excellent purchase. Considering that the microwave is usually used for heating up leftovers, boiling water, and basic tasks I see know reason to purchase the larger and much more expensive units."
2,"fried edges, cold middle","Tried on large variety of items (we microwave a lot of our meals) consistently fried edges of food while middle was cold, not cool, not warmed COLD. I hate sending it back because this means we will be without one until it is received and refunded, so not sure it was a good idea to buy this particular item via Amazon."
1,"microwave faulty, service even worst!","i bought this microwave not too long ago and the thing does no heat up, the turntable doesn't turn and when i call haier america they have some very uneducated attendants! i would not recommend buying this product or any haier products for that matter. beware!!! don't waste your money!!! this thing is no good."
2,A mistake,"This is a noisy, ineffective microwave that does not even have an option (as far as I can tell) to mute the beeps. I would not buy this product again."
1,Do not buy.,I ordered two of these; one worked two days and the other failed right out of the box. The return was expedited by Amazon at no cost. The only difficulty was preparing them for shipment.
2,Dead after 13 months,"This microwave worked fine while it lasted, but after 13 months, it has stopped working. I doubt I will buy this brand again!"
1,Stay Away,I bought this in June 2011. It worked reasonably well for one year but one year later it broke and would no longer work. I called Haier support and they told me that bc it was 1 year out from purchase there was nothing they can do for me.
3,"Not bad, but wouldn't buy another","My wonderful Sharp microwave that I bought at Target quit on me after just two years, so I thought I would try a brand that I hadn't heard of, but had good reviews. Everything I read said it was a decent working microwave at a good price. I'm not really fond of how noisy this thing is when it's running - which I expected b/c I read another person's review on it. The other negative is the fact that you can't set the microwave to run for less than a minute - normal microwaves you can set for 20 sec, 45 sec, etc. When you push the ""START"" button, that sets immediately for 30 sec, and when you push it again it will increase the cook time by 30 sec.Other than those two things, I like the microwave, I noticed that it seems to cook things from the outside in, rather than the inside out, like most others I've had. I just don't think I would purchase another, or really recommend it to someone."
3,Microwave Review,My earlier review had this at a four and now I am putting it at a three for three reasons: (1) you cannot stop the very loud four beeps by opening the door or hitting stop once they start (to indicate your time is up) (2) it is a noisy microwave - it seems to rattle during the rotation of your food (3) and you cannot use the kitchen timer feature at the same time you are actually using your microwave. Nothing horrible but all three are annoying features.
1,DEAD in 3-1/2 Minutes,"This microwave deserves ZERO star, unfortunately, 1 star is minimum.After reading many reviews on microwave, we decided to purchase Haier 1-cubic foot 1,000 watt microwave oven. We received it on August 17, 2011. It was a replacement for an 8-year old SHARP microwave.For the 1st use, I microwaved a mac & cheese for 3-1/2 minutes. When it was finished, I removed the mac & cheese and closed the microwave door. Suddenly, it DIED. We checked and tested the power outlet to make sure there was nothing wrong with it. The power outlet was working perfectly. The microwave was DEAD. DEAD. DEAD. DEAD.REALLY DISAPPOINTED with this poor quality product. Luckily, our old SHARP microwave was still working (although barely)."
4,Good microwave for the price,"I got this microwave because of the handle - didn't want the push button to open the door. I've owned this for 1 month now and it works really well. Only complaint is you can't use the microwave when the timer is on, but otherwise, it's quite powerful for a little microwave. I like the timed defrost button and the preset 30 seconds, 1 minute to 4 minute buttons."
2,Problem almost out of the box,"Used this for three days then noticed an odor of burning wires coming from the microwave. Unplugged it immediately and will be returning it right after the holidays. Also pretty flimsy inside and, like most other people, found the front door sticker very hard to remove (for all the effort it took, the thing didn't eben wind up working)."
3,Sweet animal story,"I read this as a girl, and randomly happened upon it at a used book store this week and purchased it for a dollar. It's one of a genre of books I think girls of a certain age read (I know I certainly did) about animals and their relationships with humankind. A charming, rather well written tale of a quail adopted by a family in Cape Cod."
3,"great story, poor quality paper","This is a wonderful story, but the book is printed on thin, brittle paper. The cover is extremely thin, the thinnest I'd ever seen for a book cover. I returned mine because I received it with a crumpled cover. It was easily crushed during shipping."
5,deedeesthoughts,"This is a book I read 25 years ago and loved it. I ordered this fabulous book for my niece and nephew...great service,too"
5,"A sweet, lovely story","What a sweet, lovely story. As someone who grew up in an area abundant with wildlife, this story spoke to both my mind and my heart. In meeting and learning about Robert the Quail, we get a glimpse into a wonderful creature. This story is fun, heartwarming, and real."
5,Wonderful book!,"I found this to be a really heart-warming story. It was a very easy read - very descriptive - humourous and sad. A joy to read.I really applaud these people for raising this little guy - or girl I should say.So many times I find that in this world of dogs and cats, that people often overlook other simple everyday animals. As someone who has raised orphaned baby birds and a baby raccoon and is currently being owned by a parrot, I can say that many common animals would surprise people with their wide ranging personalities - you just have to give them a chance and lots of love and patience - which is exactly what Robert received!Incredible story and an incredible bird!"
4,Songs of the British Isles great for children,"I encountered this album babysitting as a teenager (but never bought it... the earnings went to university fees!). Now that I have children of my own, I find myself trying to sing the songs as I remember them (especially The Ash Grove, All Through the Night, and An Eriskay Love Lilt). Having now found it at amazon.com, I'm ordering it in order to learn the words as lullabies, and to teach my children these sometimes lively, sometimes haunting classics of English musical folklore. Nana Mouskouri's beautiful voice is very peaceful to listen to, and her slight accent interfers only mildly with the ""Britishness"" of the songs."
2,Doesn't do it for me,"Though I am certain that Peteet is knowledgeable in her field of research, this book is quite painful to read. Her verbose style and anticlimatic narration leave the reader feeling bored and dissapointed. With such an interesting topic, I would have expected to be more captivated by this ethnography."
1,"Very, very poor","I cannot believe the other two reviews for this book. It is awful! Turgid, unreflective prose, unscholarly treatment of the most important feature of Heidegger's philosopher - namely the Being of animal life - and, perhaps most worryingly, a curious distaste for philosophers in general. A question to Prof Philipse --- why continue with philosophy if it dries out the old questions which you claim are now no longer valid?"
4,Chad Mitchell Trio,The Chad Mitchell Trio were one of the greatest folk groups ever. This album captures much of their best music in a single album. Well worth the modest cost.
4,"Great, politically-savvy songs including early JD recordings","Since John Denver is my favorite recording artist, I thought it would be good to get an album that contained some of his very early recordings. Boy, was I surprised! The CMT recordings without JD are excellent as are the early ones with JD. A good blend of serious & humorous songs. Many of the songs are right on track with the serious political issues of the era. I recommend this CD to CMT, JD and non-CMT fans alike."
5,Revisit to pleasant memories,"I first heard most of these songs in college and while in military service in the early 60s. The blending of voices appealed to many of us used to the Kingston Trio, the Limelighters, the NCM and the Serendipity Singers. But the CMT was different--the Draft Dodger Rag, Alma Mater amd Barry's Boys dealt with what we thought we were all about. Dying Business and Marvelous Toy spanned the spectrum from our childhood joy to how much it really should matter and, more imporantly, how we looked at both toys and death. The song that we all drank to when alone and reached a bit deeper was ""Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound."" As I listened to it after thirty plus years, I know where; but it brought back many dreams and ideals well worth revisiting."
5,Offers listeners a reminiscent feeling of Monet's Paris,"Definitely for lovers and those who have had their hearts recently broken........soft, flowing music. Dassin's voice is painstakingly accurate in portraying feelings of true love or heartache depending on the song.Les Jardins Du Luxembourg and L'Ete Indian are the two most wonderful tracks on this CD taking listeners to that time when Paris was romance personified!"
5,Wonderful,Yummy voice and music. So happy to have discovered him while traveling in France recently. Definitely stands the test of time.
3,Item not the same as order spec,"Received product in good condition.However, the product is not the same as I ordered.I ordered 2 tone color brown/tan but I received all black one. Considering that the shipment cost is expensive to return the product to US. I choose to accept. In anyway the all black one is also not bad although is not as good as my dream 2 tone brown/tan color."
5,a quick word,"being that there are no other books of this type out there to choose from, this book is essential for the discography information. gripes: 1st: there's too much recent muck listed in with the good stuff . 2nd: as usual, some of the prices these guys come up with are extremely debatable - but then, these guides are SUPPOSED to be a rough ""guideline"" to appraise lp's . 3rd: didn't find much on the rare soul and funk 45's & lp's i bought this book for. 4th: got a question: why are EXTENSIVE elvis presley and beatles discographies in every one of these price [...]guide books? geez! get over it already! both of those artists ALREADY HAVE THEIR OWN PRICE GUIDES and tons of books out there already covering every thought in their drug addled brains. i would have rather seen reproductions of some rare or unusual picture sleeves or lp covers. thank you. p.s. wouldn't all the price guide books be excellent if they were just music discography books instead of [...]price guides? yes, they would."
4,nice,I ordered this knife to take kayaking. I like the end loop so I can clip it down. It's a little heavier than I expected.
2,"Pretty, but disappointed!","I was really excited about getting these because I thought that they would look great around my apartment with flowers in them; however, when they arrived they were about 5 inches tall. They are pretty and look well made, but they are more figurine size and not for use."
2,J's mama,My daughter loves playing with baby dolls but not with the swing in this set. The other pieces are alright but the swing falls apart very easy and it's hard for her to get the baby in and out. Buying the pieces seperate might be better so you don't get the swing.
3,Don't get the set because of the swing....,"I just got this set for my daughter. The stroller, doll and car seat are fine, but the swing is so junky. It keeps falling down even when she barely taps it. I recommend buying the pieces individually so you don't have to waste money on the swing."
1,This is NOT by Martin Scorsese!,"Sloppy cataloguing or misleading advertising? I ordered this volume since I was intrigued by the fact that Scorsese had written something I'd not heard about. What I received (for 35 bucks including shipping) was a rather sloppily produced catalogue for an exhibition in Livorno, Italy. It contains not one word by Martin Scorsese! However, the first(double-page) photo in the book is from ""Taxi Driver"" and carries the identification ""directed by Martin Scorsese"". Okay - but that doesn't mean he wrote this book!I don't know whether it was sheer laziness, incompetence, or a frank desireto defraud that led you to list this item this way. But I insist that youcredit my Visa card with the amount you've charged me for this franklyworthless item."
3,it's okay,"I was excited to receive this book, but when I received I didn't like it that much. They repeated letters B and C twice, they didn't include letter CH nor LL. I would return it if it wasn't a hassle. If I were you I wouldn't buy it. What i did like was that the pictures were bright so my son liked it."
4,Great for bilingual kids,"Love the images and in the most part the translation is good. There are 3 letters in the book that seemed to have been difficult to find good words in both languages (for example Q = Quintuplets / quintillizos ). Overall, it is a good book to practice your ABCs in Spanish and English."
4,Emma Drummond = Elizabeth Darrell,Compelling historical fiction by Emma Drummond who also writes as Elizabeth Darrell. Lovely young Victoria Castledon marries aristocratic Charles Stanford before she knows him well enough to hesitate - and later finds out it is his notorious brother whom she truly loves. The novel moves from London to Constantinople to the valley of Balaclava as the brothers compete for her love.
4,Slavery Issues in the mind of William loren Katz,"Breaking the Chains was a well written book by a former middle school social studies teacher named William Loren Katz. It was organized in a very easy and understanding manner. This book was very interesting in that, it told about a lot more slavery issuses than a high school like myself has learned about. It brought to life many historical figures that influenced the institution of slavery on both sides if the issue. It talked about the slaves daily toils and struggles, to the fights and rebellions. It also takes you to their march to freedom. This book would be good for anyone who wants to know more about American slavery. It demonatrates how slavery in America was finally defeated through the sacrifices and rebellion of the slaves themselves. Breaking the Chains is a book that keeps your attetion from cover to cover. Katz lets the facts and truth of slavery known to man in this book."
1,Wake me when it's over,"Typical of a male perspective and characteristic of American authors, this ""Novel"" was nothing more than a airport read at best. From Pouncey's Freudian explanations of human behavior to the character MacIver finally slipping away at the end, I was left with the feeling that this book could have easily passed as a rough draft for a great novel or could be the results of a creative writing class at a junior college. If you are looking for a mild read to pass the time, say in a bathroom, or want to get away from socially relevant literature for a moment, this would be a great book."
4,a sad beauty.,"an emotionally powerful novel that drags the reader through the dirt of old age. the ways in which failing health and dying loved ones leave us less and less self-sufficient, where memory and imagination become the riches we cling to in our final days, are all over this book. the story of robert maciver's diminishing days contains a story he is himself writing about men at combat in the first world war. at first i was not thrilled to see this coming, as the story within a story device is a literary gimmick i do not much care for, but in the end the tale which maciver works out is a thrilling piece in its own right and effectively ingrates itself within the whole of the novel without seeming gimmicky at all. this was a very fine work about loss (in several forms), love, memory (and its duel head nostalgia). a piece of literature by a superb craftsman."
5,"A terrific Audible ""Read""","This book was wonderful to listen to. The Scottish brogue was perfect, the story compelling. I would recommend it to all."
3,Japanese paper,I was a little disapointed because of the small amount of paper and the designs were mostly not what I had in mind. But that can happen when you order sight unseen.
4,Great Escape,"This cd is always on my bedroom disc changer. It helps me get thru the night, despite chronic pain."
1,Normal Tennis Ball Size,"I ordered this item for my 3 1/2 pound Yorkie. Upon receipt, the balls were bigger than his whole head! The information I read stated nothing about size so I knew it was a gamble when I purchased but please know...these are normal sized tennis balls! I never used the product, but returned it via Amazon which is hassle free but had to pay the return shipping :-/"
1,jacket size,I recently bought the extra large coat with the size specifications given this coat should have at least fit that length dog. It did not. In fact the extra large could barely fit a cocker spaniel. since when is this an extra large dog.Picture is nicer than actual item. I think coat is made more for a stuffed toy then live animal.
1,misleading,"I purchased this jacket for my yellow lab, ""Chloe."" I ordered a Xlarge since she is a smaller built lab, this jacket was so small, when I got it on her it pulled her front arms up. It was also a very thin material, it would keep her warm even if it fit. I was not happy with this company sizing, it is very clear that they market to much smaller dogs."
4,I Enjoyed It,"I recently read this book on a trip I took to New Orleans with my mom and sister. (We had a 13 hour drive to get there, this was to help pass the time.)I am not a big fan of historicals and rarely read them, however the plot intrigued me. I really enjoyed this book. It wasn't great, I thought it ran a little long, but I enjoyed the chemistry between Molly and Dirk and Lady Elizabeth and Ray.The descriptions were wonderful and it had all the fun of a good Western with a touch of regency thrown in. It was also a fast read and didn't drag.However, I thought there was too much going on. More time could have been spent focusing on the relationship between Ray and Dirk and Ray and Lady Elizabeth and less spent on all of the secondary characters back at the ranch.Some of the revelations at the end had too much of a soap opera touch to them and didn't add anything to the story.Overall I enjoyed this book and will probably read more by this author."
3,Nothing Exceptional,"NO PLACE FOR A LADY is about a case of mistaken identity.Molly Riordan, an Irish maid, is erroneously believed to be her mistress Lady Elizabeth Summersby who is pregnant by the half-brother and outlaw Ray Lovejoy of the man, Dirk Ballinger, who married Molly thinking she was Lady Elizabeth. WHEW! These are not spoilers, you will find this out within the first couple of chapters,Too much going on with an insignificant plot and characters that felt like they were filler. I have enjoyed a couple other stories by Ms. Stover but I was disappointed with this romance. There is the typical anger, misunderstandings and then an epitome of love. What to do, what to do, what to do?!? It was a toss up of not liking it or thinking it was just OK. This was a conundrum so I am going to give it a very, very generous three stars for OK. There are just too many other better romances to spend your precious time reading."
3,Certainly Something to Chew On,"I found Mrs. Davis' book very helpful scripturally. The scriptures that she used clearly takes the burden/condemnation off the wife married to a non-believer, and places it squarely on the shoulders of the non-believer. It provided a lot of GREAT insight into a husbands understanding of a wife's relationship with God. A definate read for women married to non-christians."
3,Interesting but I can't unreservedly recommend...,...purchase...if you're unfamiliar with the mechanics of politics this book will enlighten you as to how it all works...but basically this book does little more than describe how Republicans have managed their political activities more adroitly than Democrats in recent years...good writing but nothing particularly exciting or enlightening.
5,"Excellent ""The Who"" T-shirt!","This was a present for my son's 16th Birthday and he's definitely a fan of ""The Who."" Really nice t-shirt, good quality, washes nicely."
2,Uncomfortable,"I ended up giving them away, they were very uncomfortable. I couldn't even get through one day with them on."
4,Tony christie is Smoothe,"Some of the songs are excellent but some of the remakes are a little on the substandard side, compared to the originals of course. All in all Christie has a great voice, easy to listen to"
2,not that great!,"I bought this tube after seeing it many times on a river where I tube a lot...I thought the coolers in the side and the storage space was really cool but I didn't like the tube at all and I'll tell you why. First off it sits way too low in the water you might as well just be down in the water and this is not fun when your in a cold spring fed river buuuurrrr! also, the tube lining fills up with water and if very heavy and hard to carry when you get out of the river. you have to deflate the tube in order to carry it. So that makes numerous trips down the river a big job! The cooler also is not very well insulated-Ice melts fast. now this is just my opinion, I gave this tube to my best friend and she loves it. I think this tube is also better suited for a petite person or kid. I am 5'7 (average weight& build) and am too tall to fit comfotably in this tube."
2,"Way smaller than you think, your sitting on the water","We bought this for floating down the river and it was horrible. You're literally sitting on the water, there is no inflation where you sit, so its just a thin layer of material between you and the water, it might as well be an innertube with no bottom. We kept passing this tube around from person to person and laughing at whoever got stuck with it cause they would be freezing and so uncomfortable. Unless you're using this in a heated pool, skip it. Even if you are using it in a heated pool, skip it, cause it costs too much for what you get. Sorry, I usually dont give bad reviews, but I dont want others to get screwed like I did."
4,What the heck are frogs?,"Whoever puts this title description and does not explain what it is does not deserve to sell this. I own this, I think, I mean I don't recall any frogs to my ....NO definately NO FROGS with this. It was just an OK item, even with out the frogs. Maybe this one is better from this seller with the frogs and may be worth 4 stars."
2,Like new means printed in the 80's,"I ordered a ""like new"" copy of this book, and when I received it the cover was not the same as the one shown in the picture. I checked the inside and it was an edition from the 80's. Hmmm. It's obviously still the same text, but I would have gone elsewhere for a ""like new"" copy if I had known I would recieve a book published before I was born"
3,Disappointed,"Although Thousand Hills was entertaining, it was not up to what I look forward to in Guthrie's works. It was not as smooth reading as others by Guthrie."
5,FINALLY!,"I am a double bassist and I also play on a string quintet. I just heard the most beautiful contemporary peace for string quintet! I was waiting a couple of months to listen the Edgar Meyer String Quintet. I was rewarded. The record is very good, even more played by the Emerson Quartet and the virtuose Edgar Meyer.And now it is the HIT PARADE on my sound sistem. It's great! Beautiful!. Congratulations."
4,Great compositions,Edgar's piece is definitely good pieces and I would say that it is more enjoyable to the general public as well as most musicians. But I would disagree and say that Ned Rorem's piece is obviously stronger and evident that it is written by a professional composer in a neo-romantic style rather than a talented bass player with blue grass roots.
4,uncommon sense for parents with teenagers.,Great book when it mentions common sense it sure hits the mark many parents don't always remeber what it was like to be a teenager this book helps you understand teenagers of this generation.
3,80% Common Sense,"Most of this book is common sense but I am willing to entertain the idea that alot of people may be short on common sense and will get more from this book. I does have a few pearls of wisdom on how to get your teenager to communicate with parents. I believe this would be more useful if purchased by parents of preteens so they can be armed with the information BEFORE they become distant, self absorbed, teen zombies."
5,Grammy Award Winning Live Performance,"We all know of the fantastic concert Roy Orbison put on back in Sept 1987, with big names like Bonnie Raitt, Bruce Springsteen, KD Lang and more. The night was filled with a mixture of old and new Orbison material, and when Roy passed away in 1988, the Orbison estate made plans as a tribute to Roy to release a soundtrack to this concert which already made its way to video when Roy was still with us.From the concert in late 1989 saw the release of the live single edited version of Oh Pretty Woman, which faired very well on the charts and got Roy a Grammy in 1990.If you have a chance to get your hands on this cd single, get it and enjoy it, unfort. it cuts out the middle section of the awesome jam session they did that night, but regardless its very nice to hear Roy in concert singing one of the best songs this world was ever graced with."
2,"Nice idea, bad execution","To say I'm disappointed with this would be giving it the best face possible.How anyone can take a proven design and turn it into something that only works poorly is beyond me.1. The lamp head is too heavy to be supported by the spring-loaded arms.2. Tension adjusting screws for the arms (to hold the lamp in position) are inadequate for their purpose unless they are tightened to the point of no return.3. The base is a sad joke. While it does allow mounting to surfaces at various angles, the single bolt to engage the base is too small in diameter and too weak. A flat bottom on the ""power base"" and clamps directly to it would be superior for strength and stability."
2,Meh broke after a year,Worked for a year then all of a sudden Ballast went out. Wont turn on or give power to sockets... Dont bother with this one folks.
1,False Advertising,"Price paid was for new item. Item received was re-packaged to the extent that Styrofoam crumbs tumbled from box as lamp was removed, additional parts were loose, etc. The fluorescent bulbs have begun to darken at one end, as happens when/as these bulbs are used. There are small nicks and scratches in the lamp shade. The item should have been sold as what it is, USED! I've now spent over an hour searching amazon.com for a way to contact the merchant, apparently that option is removed once the item is shipped!"
1,do not buy,"What a joke. There are incorrect answers and errors abundance in the book as well as in the cd exams. Do not buy, waste of time, and you will go besserk trying to figure out why your answer is wrong, until you realize the book is wrong."
1,False Advertising,"Aside from the errors the other reviewers mention, on the cover and in the introduction it states that you get free online help and additional practice on the curvebreakers website. Wrong. The only free option on the website is a discussion board. I attempted to ask a question about a problem in the book and I was told that I needed to pay for private tutoring. Do yourself a favor, and just buy the books from LSAC or Kaplan."
1,Big waste of time,"The previous reviews pretty much sum it up - loads of errors, ambiguous questions and answers, and style very different from actual LSAT material.Also, it claims 8 practice exams on the included CD - there are only 7 (at least on mine). Let's just say that I knew I was in trouble when I read the help section on the CD and it was talking about the SAT, not the LSAT. I seriously wonder how Harvard feels about their name being liberally attatched to this book...Save yourself the trouble - don't waste 2.5 hours taking any of the tests in this book. Get a REAL LSAT book with REAL LSAT questions!"
2,not cute,i was shocked when i put the case on my phone it is ugly and does not look like quality merchandisevery disappointed
1,This did not work for my truck as stated.,"I put these on my truck and at first the drivers side which was the one with the problem, did raise about an inch and a half. But once it setteled by the next day it was right back where it was before. I bought these as they state they are for my truck with the issue of the drivers side being lower than the passenger side."
2,Very disappointing,"Mose Allison is not all that great. He's not stupid, but he doesn't exert his mind enough to make his ideas really interesting. He's not really jive, and he's not ""whitey,"" but he isn't much else either. His chops aren't too hot, to boot. I guess his appeal is that Pete Townshend of The Who finds himself cheering Mose's songwriting and recorded his ""Blue Blues."". I don't figure. Anyway, his voice is humdrum, and his piano playing is not sharp. I dismiss him as being for freshman mentalities. I am reviewing disc one of the twofer ""Mose Allison"" by Mose Allison, which is the same as ""Back Country Suite"" (Sides 3 & 4 are his other '57 album, ""Local Color"".) I docked the album one star because of obscene liner notes by Mr. Townshend."
2,A rare misfire from Leconte,"Le Parfum d'Yvonne is a rare misfire from Patrice Leconte that doesn't really work on any level. The main problem with this remembrance of love lost is the casting: Jean-Pierre Marielle is fine as the archetypal ageing queen and matchmaker-cum-chaperone, but neither Hippolyte Girardot or Sandra Majani bring much to the lovers, leaving us with fragments of a vague relationship between two people we don't care about. Not painful, but lacking purpose and capped off with an absurd ending that seems to be there simply to give the film an exclamation point.Second Sight's PAL UK DVD has no extras but does offera good subtitled transfer in the film's original 2.35:1 ratio."
3,Marvin heater,This heater had some discoloration on it. It works great. we are useing it day'ly. It suppliments our heat system very well. It was just as Amazon discribed it.
5,Best Heater with Reasonable Price!,"I have this heater ever since 1999, and it is so great. It is so quiet and won't make you feel dry because there is a space to put water in to make stream. Friends have been asking it to get one. I am highly recommended to get one at your home. And I do plan to buy another one for my mother."
4,"Clear, evocative descriptions highlight this excellent novel","Clear, evocative descriptions highlight this excellent novel by William Hoffman. Hoffman draws you in to the pages of Tidewater Blood until you can taste the rich, plaster dust in the shattered mansion of an old Virginia family, or feel the immense weight of the timeless, coal-laden mountains of West Virginia. The destroyed mansion is a metaphor for a ruined family, and the shrouded, ancient mountain coves a cautionary tale of our place in the world. Justice is well served as ex-con and fugitive Charley LeBlanc reaches into the mountains to uncover his family's secrets. The black sheep of his family, Charley is searching for his place in life, hoping to find it before the law catches up to him. If there is a flaw to Mr. Hoffman's fine book, it is perhaps a too-pat ending. Tidewater Blood is highly satisfying, nonetheless."
3,"Suspense? Maybe as a movie, but it's a picaresque first..","I have an obscure connection to Mr. Hoffman. He and I both attended Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, and although we never met, I have been aware of him and to some degree his work for more than 25 years.Mr. Hoffman is an accomplished novelist and story teller, but I couldn't get past the fact that this seemed less a reader's than a film watcher's journey. And the idea that Tidewater Blood is a ""suspense"" (as the book jacket says) is less descriptive of its value than an older genre term: it is much more a picaresque journey of an independent son of the south through his conscious and unconscious past.It's neither a page turner nor a put-down. What Tidewater Blood is is good, solid fiction from a writer who may be tiring of the work that comes with writing very well.I choose not to hold it as the best example of Mr. Hoffman's talent."
3,Disappointed,I was a little let down after reading all the raves about this book. The local color was enjoyable and educational - I really felt like I was there. But the characters were cardboard and the plot drifted along slowly. The payoff was detailed but lacked suspense.Only recommended for those who have read every other thriller out there.
4,good read.,"This book kind of reminds me of, The Fugitive. The underdog running from the law while trying to prove his innocence. I thought both the setting and the characters were interesting. Good ending as well."
4,Informative Geographical Mystrey,Set in an area I knew little about I found this book very interesting and compelling. It definitely kept me reading and was well written.
2,book didnt offer,im sorry two stars book did not offer any information that i couldnt get off the internet free of charge not happy with this one
1,Ripped Off,I returned product because it was the same as the online video. I was deceived into thinking it was much more including receipes. BE Careful how you interpet the reviews. I lost alot $5.10 of money to return.
2,a disappointment,"if you actually want a real ""best soul album in the world,"" buy al green's own album, it's a better guarantee. besides ""let's get it on"" and a few other notables like the temptations, this album has little to offer."
3,As expected,"Pretty well done, good craftsmanship and quality. There is nothing real spectacular, I will probably purchase more next year for Christmas."
5,Bach just doesn't get any better,"Walcha's playing is so inspired and insightful as to be almost unbelievable. His articulations are very ""baroque"" (way before the time the authentic performance train chugged out of its dusty railway yard), his choice of registration (given the complete set is recorded on only two organs) delightful. The one thing that amazes me is Mr. Walcha's ability to commit so much music to memory. If you think there's too much Bach on this set you don't know and only want the old favourites, think again. A highlight for me are the chorale preludes ... each one a gem and each one so intelligently observed. If I have any criticism it's that neither of the organs has a 32' stop. Yes, I can hear the authentics drawing breath, but even Bach remarked on the fact that the organ in Leipzig had a 32' stop and that he missed it on other organs."
5,THE ONE,"If you're looking for the greatest Bach organ performance on disk - look no further - you've found it. These interpretations by the blind mystic, Helmut Walcha, are literally out-of-this-world, transcendent. His Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor maybe the premier tour de force solo on any instrument in classical music. Not to say there have not been other fantastic Bach organ recitals - Albert Schweitzer and E. Power Biggs were no wimps. But the exalted, otherworldly quality of Walcha's playing has, in my opinion, never been equalled, and evokes in the listener a feeling of the deepest reverence."
3,A bit about Walcha,"I studied organ for many years at Penn State Harvard and elsewhere, and my view of Walcha has been shaped by performance practice as it was taught to me.Walcha, like Karl Richter, was a technical perfectionist, made all the more remarkable by the fact that he was blind from childhood. However, like Richter, his playing was relatively staid and does not reflect more recent scholarship on Baroque performance practice.Although it is well worth hearing Walcha, a more spontaneous performance is that of Chapuis on Valois, and Rubsam on Philips is likewise preferable.Joel Warren Lidz, Ph.D."
2,"low-intensity, as with Part 1","As with Part 1, I suppose this video could be useful to people with more severe scoliosis and/or old age. But the workouts are too easy for a half-way fit person. And since scoliosis varies so much from patient to patient, it'd be much better to visit a good physical therapist a couple times."
2,Disappointed,Had thought this would provide more beneficial exercises relating to scoliosis and strength building. Could possibly be helpful to those that have breathing concerns...would return but opened and played the cd...so I'm just out of luck and $20.00.
3,Good Pics But No Substance,"This is a good ""coffee table"" book but no stories to go along with the pictures. There is an intro from Hilly Kristal (R.I.P) but that's about it. Also not to many pictures from the later years or even from the hardcore days. A lot of Blondie, Television stuff.If you wanna browse pics or have friends look at it to remember the good ol' days this book is cool. If you want a story and and detail events look somewhere else."
3,Eh...,"A beautifully produced book of mostly band photos. I'd hoped for more photos of the crowd and the venue itself. I wanted more history and a better sense of the place. But again, a very nice coffee table book."
4,Without CBGB ther wouldn't a max's II,My husband is Tommy Dean owner of max's II and living in Florida. He remebers Hillystarting New Wave/ Punk and launched the whole scene.
4,"Wow, they look so young!","The history captured in the pictures in great. It was bought as a gift for a music fan. After spending a lot of time looking for a DVD history of the CBGB, I ""settled"" for this book. While there isn't much narrative on the history of the place, the pictures tell a great story on their own. The baby faced pictures of artists we grew up with makes it a great purchase for music fans."
4,pleased,"I bought this CD primarily for one cut, the Cascada song, but knew I would like some other electronica in my collection. It's been a nice addition to my library."
5,it was good.,a stupid little book that i've never read..i just did this to experiment cuz i have this poetry book due monday and i need a limerick poem.
1,This book was not what I expected it to be.,"I was very disappointed by this book. I was looking for something that would provide creative ideas for projects/activities for either my 2 year old or my 9 year old. For example, # 217 When you drive past a cornfield, go slowly to admire their beauty and think about the hard work that went into growing the cornstalks."" My 9 year old could care less and my 2 year old would be interested for about 2 minutes. At what age would that be interesting to a child????"
2,Not very helpful,"As a preschool teacher, I am always looking for fun and creative ideas and activities for my classroom. Although there are a few interesting ideas in this book, overall it is a big disappointment. Parents won't find many activities that will keep your child busy or interested for long and many of the ideas are not developmentally appropriate."
5,Fabulous book. Reviewers missed the point.,"This is a fabulous book for parents or teachers who can slow their lives down and help their children look at and think about the simple things in life - things in nature, things in the world around us. Most people are so busy looking at the fast images on TV, they don't know how to slow down and help their children to wonder, to ask questions, to look behind the scenes, and to watch closely. This book is a treasure."
1,Too Small Even For a Doorstop,"While this book does contain some information which may be useful to, say, comatose goats trying to break into a career in desktop publishing, this book provides no easy way of accessing it. The index and glossary are woefully useless and the book is disorganized and nauseatingly simplistic. If one of your coffee table's legs is a little bit too high, this book may just be perfect for you. For those of you with un-wobbly coffee tables, I suggest the Quark for dummies book. It is a crying shame that one star is the lowest possible rating allowed. I hope I have been successful in dissuading you from purchasing this book, you'll thank me later."
5,"Camaro-Anthony Young ,156 pages,Softcover,2003,Lowe & B.Hould Publishers,ISBN#0-681-20005-7","Camaro-Anthony Young ,Softcover,156 pages,2003,Lowe & B.

Anthony Young as Usual has done a Stellar job! Would recommend to Any Camaro Fan!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Item(s) stay's in great shape if you don't wash it. Once you due, it loses much of it's integrity and fades more than you'd like."
3,SHORT HAIRS ONLY,mkay so i has serious samurai hair for being whitey white white. and i gata say this head band jst dnst look as good on me as it dose on my short haired asian counter parts plain and simple. BUY THESE HEAD BANDS IF U <3 JAPAN!!!
4,Works good,My only complaint is that it is hard to clean once it gets dirty. You can't get to the area easily where food gets on it. It is a handy tool for opening a variety of things!
2,Disappointing,"This is the second Kuhn Rikon Auto Safety Master Opener I've purchased. I thought I got a lemon the first time, so I tried again. I open a lot of cans (6 cats) and I love the idea of no sharp edges. This is a highly-rated item - so did I just get unlucky yet again? Initially, the Master Opener worked beautifully: turn the handle 12 times, until you hear and feel the ""click"", then use the little tool on the side to lift the lid off. Wonderful. But with time and use it ceased to function. After a month, although the ""click"" still occurs, the lid does not detach, and I have to go through another cycle, and another - or give up and use a standard opener. This is a great concept, but it just does not perform as promised. Especially for the high price. The other end of the opener has a triple-tool (craft-bottle, twist-top and flip-top openers) and I will keep the opener for those tools, but use my trusty 25 year old Swing-Away for cans."
5,This is my third Kuhn Rikon opener purchase,This is the best opener I have ever purchased and would not buy anything else - or go back to the yucky old fashioned kind that touches the food and leaves a sharp edge. I suggest you read the instructions because this does not work like a regular opener but once you get the hang of it you will be happy you purchased it.
5,The only can opener you'll need,"Had an earlier model of Kuhn Rikon side-opening can opener that eventually bit the dust after many years and lots of abuse. I always worked flawlessly.After going through 4 cheap can openers in just three months, I decided we needed to go back to the tried and true.Although this is a slightly different style than what we had before, the concept is the same and the construction is just as sturdy and reliable. It opens cans reliably and effortlessly, and after all these years there is still very little else on the market like it.I never thought I'd get passionate about a can-opener, but here I am. Go figure."
4,Great opener,"I got this can opener on Amazon after seeing it on qvc. It is a little complicated to figure out at first but once you get the hang of it, the opener works great. I really like how the edges of the can are smooth after you are done."
4,Great multi-functional product,Well designed to solve some of the vexing product opening problems all in one sleek unit. My wife had particular problems with pull tabs and lately with some can openings. Both are neatly handled with this tool. Maybe a bit expensive in fact qVC has it for $5 cheaper but it works out about the same when you figure in shipping and time.
2,"Doesn't always open cans, some cans needs multiple cycles around to get open","I was excited to get this can opener because it would lift the tops off cans easily. Instead, this can opener has been a bit of a pain to own. I usually have go at least 2 times, sometimes 3 or 4 times around the entire can to cut the lid off enough to be able to lift it off. And then there have been some cans where no matter how many times i went around, it simple would not cut because the design of the can and this opener did not work together. This opener has been a disappointment."
3,Kuhn Rikon Opener,"Would not recommend this but i did and its OK. I will try to make use of this item, but."
2,Opener operation,"The first can I attempted to open was a bust. It was a large can and the opener spun around the lip distorting the lid while never removing the top or even creating a hole. I had to finish the process with a military P-38. Wouldn't recommend for large cans and has spent the remainder of time in my drawer unused.Kuhn Rikon Auto Safety Master Opener, Red"
4,GREAT.,"you can open many different kinds of cans with this.It was little hard to figure out at first, but once you figure how to use, its GREAT."
5,Super cool and super easy to use,"Its the best can opener i have ever used...it is so easy to use that u feel like doing it again and again...seriously, its so much fun when can opening becomes so easy....nyways, if u cant figure out how to use it(b/c i wasnt able to initially)...try watching this video on youtube: [...]This helps.I used to use this before and it sucks...Hamilton Beach 76375 CleanCut Extra-Tall Can Opener, White"
5,Best.Opener.Ever,"Love this opener! I have never been a fan of the electric can openers and most hand can openers get disgustingly dirty. This opener (its so much more than just a ""can opener"") never gets dirty when opening cans, I love the fact that the lid does not fall inside the can Im opening and there are no sharp edges on the lid. Its also easy to use, although it took me about 2-3 cans to really get the feel of it since it does operate differently than old style can openers. Opens bottles, removes twist off caps and has a hook to lift tabs off of cans (such as soda cans). Buy this - you wont be disappointed."
3,Disappointed,It doesn't meet my expectations (not as good as the 15 year old one I was replacing)....sometimes have to make more than one time around lid and getting the 'lift off' hook to engage not always easy.
4,Great multi tool,"This is a great tool.I love how it opens the can without any sharp edges. I can even let my kids to do it without any worry of a cut.In addition, after opening a can, I can ""close"" it by putting the lid back on. The way it opens the can, the lid can be placed back on a can for a pretty tight fit.My only issue with this opener, is its size. It is a BIG opener and I am sure it could have been made similar in size to a regular can opener."
5,Auto safety master opener,"At first I didn't like this product at all. Why you might ask. Because I couldn't get it to work. The directions, to me, just didn't make sense to me. So, I ended up calling Kuhn Rikon. A very pleasant woman tried to help me out over the phone. Still didn't understand. She told me how to get to the online video that shows you how to do it. Now, I really like it. I just wouldn't suggest it for someone that has arthritis real bad in the hands. It's not extremely ""easy"" on the hands."
5,Works Great!,I bought this product to take the lids of cans so that I could make alcohol stoves. It ended up being my favorite can opener. Works great.
4,Dusty,Great Album! Sure brings back memories of riding in the 68 Ford LTD with my Dad. Son of a Preacher man is my favorite.
5,Dusty Could do no Wrong!,"Dusty Springfield was an intelligent focused performer. These songs are great and tell the story of her era.My favorites are her ballads. ""Goin Back"" is a haunted masterpiece of a Byrds song.""The Look of Love "" is another pop gem. Bacharach should be proud of that cover!She is the best girl singer of all time in my book. Her inflections and artistry make pop something special. I miss her great voice, but her legend lives on!"
2,The very best? of Dusty Springfield,If this is the Very Best of Dusty then what it tells me that she had a couple of good songs which are on this CD. The rest sound like rehashing of the hot sellers. Dusty is a Great singer and I'm glad to reminisce about those days past. But the rest of the songs I surely don't remember on the hit parader back then.
3,Remembering when,"This CD is a great collection of Dusty's performances. She had great presence and a fabulous voice. Recording quality, or mixing quality, is poor, however... It sounds like it's done in a metal can. Not worthy of Dusty's performance at all."
4,This book will benefit anyone who reads it.,The advice in this book makes so much sense! It is holistic and intuitive. The writer clearly understands that health and well-being is more than just food. The book is an outstanding collection of information. And I like the recipes. Most of them are quick and easy. I recommend it!
5,Wish you were here and I do are the best two songs,"These songs are the best songs if you've lost someone in your life that you cherished very deeply. I lost my boyfriend of 4 years to a cimi and car wreck then this song came out "" Wish you were here"" and its really helped me through rough times."
5,"Haydn's Spectacular ""Jahreszeiten""","Karl Boehm is a master of classical music interpretation. This performance is unique in the series of Beethoven, Haydn and Mozart recordings. The obvious inspiration in the ""Jahreszeiten"" is spellbinding. This music contains many figures which point to Beethoven and great romantic music which follows Haydn's summit of the classical musical form. Boehm takes excellent care of each note, each phrase and theme. Overall delightfull recordings worthy of immediate addition to the collection of any serious student of the classical genre."
3,Nice bright red,"The color is a shiny bright red, which is what I wanted. The buckle on the one I received is silver. I had to replace it with the buckle from my old strap so that it would match the gold case of my watch. The strap did not come with spring bars and is a bit shorter than standard ladies length, but it will work fine."
3,Definitive but poorly presented,"This is an A-Z of Egyptology which will act as a definitive reference. Two downsides:1) There is no narrative introduction to the subject, so this Encyclopedia would complement a 'history', but not replace it2) The photographs are in black and white and are often bad quality: badly focussed, badly lit."
1,Not worth [money] much less 10 times that amount,"The problem with this encyclopedia is that it is not encyclopedic in nature. Many topics are not covered (for example, you won't find Hatshepsut's mortuary temple in it), and those that are covered are handled in a very simplistic and abbreviated (not concise, just short) way.I cannot remember when I was so disappointed in a reference book...maybe never."
1,Warning for flat screen owners!,"I'll leave the content reviews to the many others here who have left their opinion.My pet peeve is that there is no warning that you've paid your hard earned money for a DVD in good faith to watch on your big screen TV at home, and then this picture comes on in HALF size. Where do they get off with this rip off? We've bought the largest screen we can afford to maximize our home theater experience and then we see a reduced size picture surrounded by blank screen.I would buy no DVD's with this shortchanging as a matter of principle alone!"
1,Reality Bites,And so does this piece of pretentious trash! Half-hearted plodding thru a directionless plot by has-beens and wannabe's. The music (what music?) was just as mindless. This movie had so much unleased potential that it was almost torture to watch. I gave it one star for the nice scenery.
2,Definitely not my Téchiné préféré,"Wild Reeds and Htel des Amériques were wonderful films, but then Téchiné got repetitive, long-winded, and obsessed with Arabs, family discord and to a lesser degree, gays. Though influenced - he says - by Brecht and Ingmar Bergman, the man is obviously not as brilliant as either one of them. A good director, as far as I can see, keeps exploring new ground, expanding his vision and drawing on his imagination. Think of Kurosawa, Carné, Bertolucci... This particular film, despite great performances, is like a bad reality show segment... Lots of drama, endless discussion, plenty of hurt feelings and feelings of victimhood, and endless emotional dissection. The film lacks finesse, nuance or revelation. The plot is linear -- no flashbacks, no dreams, nothing to break up the dogged boredom. Some people like this kind of film. I thought it was trash."
2,"short, flat, too familiar. nice photos though","although this full of sharp insights and vivid descriptions, this novella seems to consist only of the scaffolding that houellebecq has used in his other novels - grim, witty 'michel character!, character who is even worse off than michel, pornographic writing -without the depth that made them engaging. There are things to think about such as society's rights and wrongs in allowing sects and violence to flourish (well, not much violence but I couldn't avoid the pun). Overall, 'lanzarote' resembles 'whatever' more than it does 'atomised' or 'platform' in that it leaves you pensive (or confused) despite disappointingly little in terms of events."
4,the first ones were the last ones,"Actually after chekin some ""NOW"" cds i realised that the first ones, like this, were the last ones where really incluides good music, that I can say ""this what i call music"", too sad..."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This album desereves -100 stars ,it's the worst CD I ever bought.the 1st song ...baby one more time from Britney Spears is great but the rest of the album is GARBAGE! DO NOT BUY IT!"
2,an ok cd -not one of the better now's,"...I think they had a poor variety of the music on this cd.Unfortunatly though not many great artists had come out yet.Britney Spears just arrived before the songs were picked.Britney,new radicals,sheryl crow,garbage,backstreet boys,and jay-z were probally the only really good songs on here...."
3,Pretty Okay,"Yeah, it's allright. But, huh? Sublime! Sublime does not belong on this album. Sublime is so superior to these other songs... and that leads to another thing: they mixed this CD horrendously. Doesen't flow whatsoever. Look, some good songs, I LOVE Boys II Men; as a matter of fact I appreciate most every kind of music from Classical (& Barouqe and Romantic [era]), to hardcore rap and then to reggae! The rock is kinda boring for the most part; Boys II Men are good on this CD, same as a few other great songs but they are not so great that you just have to buy it! You're probably a lot better off making your own mix or better yet buying the artists that have good songs' albums. I advise you listen to all these samples before you dive into your wallet."
4,Now! 2 Holds Up,"The Now! 2 CD, compares nicely to the others in the series, with the exception of possibly Now! 3, because there is a collection of better songs on 2 than on 3. The album includes standard Now! artists like Britney Spears(Baby One More Time), 98 Degrees(Because Of You), and Backstreet Boys(I'll Never Break Your Heart) which is a favorite of mine, but it's also nice to see artists like Garbage(I Think I'm Paranoid) which is totally original and EverClear(Father Of Mine) and also Sheryl Crow is finally put on a hits collection album the song chosen was ""My Favorite Mistake"" which is the perfect song for this album and the sole reason to buy this Now! album. This is the only Now! album Sheryl Crow appears on and that makes the album all that much special. There are others on here that make this album work and that's where I think Now! 3 went wrong, but Now!2 manages to hold it's own."
3,"Nice,but music changes.","At first I really enjoyed this CD.It has modern hits....or does it?The spice girls died out long ago.I felt no need for more.Also,It seemed that some artists were missing.Genie in a bottle by christina aguilaiar,was far more popular then becuase of you by 98*.But then again,no Cd is perfect,but other flaws made this Cd worse.the title says NOW 2,meaning modern music.Some CD's,you will like 5 months later.Not this one. the current hits will change,making this Cd seem poorer.It's a nice compilation,but it gets old,so beware."
4,Pretty Good,"The thing you have to know when you are buying this C.D. is that this is a compilation of greatest hits from many fields of music (Pop, Rock, Rap, R&B, e.t.c.) so it will be extremely rare if someone likes every single song on the C.D. Still, it is a very good C.D. Hit Me Baby One More Time gets pretty annoying, as do some of the later tracks. But Everybodies Free To Wear Sunscreen, Take Me There, My Favorite Mistake, Praise You and several others are very good."
3,Safe music for 13-14 year olds,"The NOW series has generaly safe music that is popular among young teens around 13-14 years old. This is pretty much ""Back Street Boyz"" type music - harmless and little kids love it. Some of the songs are even catchy (though honestly most of it wouldn't appeal to anyone who's been out in the world)."
4,OK CD,"This CD has some nice songs like ""Baby One More Time,""and ""I'll Never Break Your Heart,""but Totally Hits is much better and has more hits than the Now series. Check out Totally Hits if you want a fantastic CD!"
5,Rad Collection,This cd is a great collection of hit songs from the last couple of months. If u only prefer one song from a certain group & dont wanna buy their this cd is perfect.
2,The Worst Of the Series,"NOW 2 is the flimsiest piece of filth in this musical series. If you have read my review of NOW 6, you will know that I am not a fan of the editing process. FIVE songs get this treatment! If I spend [money] for a CD, I expect to get what the artist recorded. On this CD, the artists featured didn't record much. Whose pea-brained idea was it to put Baz Luhrmann's idiotic ""Everybody's Free"" on it?? When I heard this in my car, I always turned to another station. Artists such as 98 Degrees, Semisonic,Robbie Williams, and the Backstreet Boys just add to the mess that is NOW 2. Only a few songs rise above the mess, such as ""Never There"" by Cake & ""My Favorite Mistake"" by Sheryl Crow. I'm glad the other CDs in the series are better (I think NOW 3 & 4 are the best of the bunch). I hope NOW 7 (which will be out soon, I'm sure)is better than NOW 2...it just reeks."
4,Great,"The first nine songs are good. So are 13-14, and 17-18. I bought this CD becasue I liked Baby one more time, praise you, millennium, and sheryl crow I ended up liking more songs"
1,this cd sucks to the max,why not but something on this cd besides all the teeny-bopping crap?the only good artists on it are cake and sublime. don't buy this - it's a waste of money.
1,Not happy :(:(:(,THIS MOVIE DOES NOT WORK :( I RECIEVED IT RIGHT BEFORE CRISTMAS AND WENT TO WATCH IT WITH MY FAMILY AND IT DIDNT WORK. PLEASE GET BACK TO ME AT LYNDSAY733@HOTMAIL.COM very dissapointed!! Please contact me! i have been trying to contact someone since this happened :(
3,Not as Good as the Originals!!!,"This sequel doesn't really have the spirit of the originals, but it tries. Mikey and Julie have grown and they want dogs for Christmas. Mollie refuses to get one, but James is more open to the idea. This time, we have Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton as the voices of Rocks and Daphne; two dogs who can't get along and become adopted by the Ubriacco family. On Christmas Eve, James is stuck with his female boss who is trying to seduce him, and Mollie and the rest of the gang try to find him. When they have car trouble, a wolf shows up and tries to attack Mollie, and it's up to Rocks to save his new family. I would recommend LOOK WHO'S TALKING NOW!!!"
3,A great series of movies,"This is a great series of movies, but I liked the 1st one the best. Who does not like John Travolta. It is a funny movie but I recommend watching all three of them to get the best laughs."
3,"Funny, charming, and appealling family entertainment","This film was an enormous flop with critics (heck, these kinds of movies never do well with them) but I must admit to liking it. The story may be familiar, however there are many terrifically hilarious moments and good dramatic touches of family values. Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton lend very funny, imaginative voice-overs to the two dogs. The rest of the cast is also first rate. Not a must-see family classic, but still entertaining for the whole set."
4,The Funniest Movie in the whole wide World!,Daphine and Rocks were in mud at night and Julie was making fun Rocks and It was a the funniest in the whole wide world!
5,Better than the sequel!,"This time around, the Ubriaco's let two dogs into the family, and it is just hilarious! Danny Devito and Diane Keaton supply the voices of the two dogs who are always at each others throats. Kirstie Alley and John Travolta give good performances as the parents who are learning to live with the new pets around the house, and the lady that plays Travolta's sexy and coniving boss...she's good too!Watch it with the family, and, unlike the first two, the PG-13 on this one is rather tame, so don't worry about showing this one to your kids without guidence.It's great!"
1,Sorry. This one just doesn't make it.,"I was real disappointed when I saw this movie. It wasn't as good as Look Who's Talking, the first episode, and it was worse than Look Who's Talking Two. It was a waste of time."
1,Yikes!!!....what were they thinking?,"Okay, maybe this movie would have been a big hit in 1952....but these days, cheesy talking dogs and a plot that would even make Bob Saget barf, just DOES NOT hold up as a good movie. They shouldn't have made this third ""Look Whose Talking."" It's not funny.....it's bad acting...and the only station that would even consider airing it is ""The Super Station"" Save your money, go buy the original two movies. At least they were some what cute."
1,never got it igot i refund,hi i never received this order they had to refund my money which i wasn't very happy about it so thats my experience with this deal
1,What a waste of a tree.,"The best thing that I can say about this book is that they only bothered to make four ""practice"" tests. I've done parts of the first two, and have found inconsistencies beyond belief. There are questions with totally incorrect answers, there are typos all over the place, and they ask some of the most idiotic questions I've ever seen. If this is the best test preparation for the CS GREs, it's only because when you arrive at the real test you're so relieved to see a decently written question or two that you actually do well. This is the pits."
1,I can't find a worse book than this,This book's general coverage is too broad. It is not intended for GRE at all. And also there is so much maths work in it that we don't need to know.
1,The Worst Test Preparation,"Almost the entire content of this book is four ""practice"" Computer Science GRE exams. Not only do these exams bear almost no resemblance to the actual GRE exam, many of the questions are so vague and riddled with typos that the book is a joke. My advise is to stick to study material from the ETS, the writers of the GRE exams."
1,"well it is ""zero star"" actually..","They wrote the book and never read it again! At least they could correct typos. Well the material is inconsistent, questions are weird, answers are incorrect. I have doubts that they've never seen a real GRE test. Don't waste your money and your nerves."
2,"barely useful, not worth any money","This book is one of the very few preparations books for the Comp. Sci. GRE, but that does NOT make it useful. I bought it out of desperation for anything, but it bore no resemblence to the actual exam, was filled with errors, and the descriptions of the answers are incomprehensible.If you want a preparation book, just do the practice test ETS sends you and talk to your prof about the ones you didn't know. That will help you much more than this book, and will give you a solid preparation."
1,Wo is me for not looking at the reviews!!!,"If I could go lower than one start I would. This book was test preparation trash. I looked at Amazon and since they were out of stock I bought at a brick-and-mortar establishment. Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews are even glance at the ranking and can only hope others might and save their dough.Typos, worthless and dumb questions, etc. You name a bad way to craft a test and REA did it. One horrible thing was how ambiguous the questions were. I went over 3 of the 4 test before throwing up my hands in disgust. I went over the 1st test in detail with a friend and we found that almost each question with many factors of the question ambiguous or assumptions (incorrect sometimes) that were not stated at all, let alone clearly.I recently took the real thing and this book did nothing outside of practicing picking A,B,C,D or E.A definite DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,This is not even a book... it's terrible,"The professors and editors who collaborated to put this piece of worthless compilations of tests together get a big fat F from me! The so called ""detailed"" explanations are esoteric and vague. What makes for a good Computer Science GRE test prep book would be one that goes over the various topics and tries to cover the fundamental to intermediate concepts. This book does nothing of that nature as it simply lists four mock tests w/ brief descriptions to each question at the end of the test section. It seems like a few people got together one weekend and lumped together 300 or so questions from their lecture notes and then divided it by four tests to make a book. Completely useless book!"
1,If There's a Worse GRE Prep. Book I Haven't Found It!,"This book contains four ""sample"" GRE tests. After going through them though I doubt the authors ever bothered to look up the word ""sample"" in a dictionary. These tests are horrible. The questions are ill-conceived, outdated, and bear little to no resembelance to actual GRE exams. Stay away from this book, stay far away."
2,Groundskeeper Willie-esque,"I'm sorry, but I cannot get my head around lead singer James Graham's uncompromisingly thick Scottish accent. It's like listening to Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons. If it wasn't for his prominent voice, Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters would almost certainly be a classic."
3,Almost good,"This is a disappointing album. It is disappointing because it is frustrating. It is frustrating because amongst the swamp of guitar noise there are the roots of what could've been some wonderful songs. Three almost make it: Cold Days From The Birdhouse; That Summer, At Home I Had Become The Invisible Boy; And She Would Darken The Memory. Beautiful in moments but the problems are the same in each of them - they start well and then disappear into a big sort of ssssrrrrrshhhhhrrrshhsh guitar-noise-blanket which, while no bad thing itself, seems to act as a sort of lazy dénouement/coda for each song. So it means that the last two minutes of Birdhouse, the last minute of That Summer and the last two minutes of Darken the Memory are just ssrrrssssshhrrrshhh...such a shame. These songs could've been really really strong. So, yeah...frustrating."
4,An admirable debut and fun to decipher the Scottish accent,"This one made my ""Best Albums of 2007"" list (see http://www.amazon.com/Best-Albums-of-2007/lm/R1TUKG73VXM141/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full). I am not sure how I found out about this band, probably from one of the music blogs I subscribe to or from metacritic.com. The singer sings with a thick Scottish accent which makes it hard to understand the words sometimes but it also makes it fun to sing along with. All in all, a very admirable debut."
3,Worth seeing,"I watched this movie after turning off The Ninth Gate. Compared with Polanski's plodding film, I found this refreshing, invigorating. There are visual effects reminiscent of Godard, Bergman, Cassavetes, Warhol. Very interesting. Some parts were lame, such as the gathering of female heads to discuss the prospects of the relationship between Eli and Max, but other scenes made up for this.In one scene the talking heads are discussing what to call the female genitals, and no one says the ""p"" word. That surprised me.The movie did seem a bit sanitized, like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. No bitchiness, no cruelty, no stealing your friend's girlfriend... The goodhearted confrérie of lesbians was a little cloying.Finally, I ordered this film from Netflix because I thought it was by a filmmaker who made a legendary lesbian film in 1974. But her filmography says she is much younger. I ordered the wrong ""Go Fish"" by the wrong filmmaker."
2,Relative but still not any Good,"This movie is painfully artsy. It's very early 90s ""My So Called Life"" angst mixed with depression. Plus terrible amateur acting, and moments of unnecessary cliche cinematic affectations. I will probably watch this movie again, just because I relate. On the whole, though, not a good film."
3,Playing hard to get,"Lesbian love story set in Chicago. The two main characters that everyone in lesbian community is trying to hook up are polar opposites. One is young and pretty, while the other one is older and homely looking. Both are looking for the right love interest in their lives and are not rushing in their pursuit of finding one. While acting is somewhat substandard, we do get close to this story as everyone, regardless of the gender can relate to sincere efforts of finding a true love. In addition to intimate view of lesbian life and community, film also raises other questions such as commitment between two people, diversion of lesbian woman in sexual relationship with a man and what it means to other lesbian's perception of her."
2,Quite missable- only if REALLY you have nothing else to do!,"I guess for its time this movie was really groundbreaking because it was the first film made by lesbians for lesbians. But seeing it now is just painful. Aside from Guin Turner, this movie boasts some of the scariest looking females I have ever seen. The dialogue is contrived and the acting is appalling. I mean I realize they had a really limited budget to work with or whatever, and kudos, but theres really no reason you should waste 2 hours of your life on this film. Get something else."
4,"quality acting, diverse themes","A gay friend of mine dragged me (kicking and screaming, I might add) to this film. I'm not gay, but I still got a kick out of this film. It was not what I expected. Tender moments, scenes that make you think and scenes that make you double over in your chair from laughter.Definitely worthwhile seeing. An interesting black & white and often surreal view of a sub-culture within our American culture. An interesting & mind-provoking insight into what makes relationships work, regardless of your orientation. Is it looks, attitude, money?The film is not for kids... this film has nudity, adult themes and some domestic violence."
3,Go Fish - A Rainy Day Film,"I really like this movie. Yes, I know it's a warm&fuzzy film but it also makes me laugh. I loved the short bits of artography between the scenes. And though I did feel that VS Brodie could have really worked on her lines a bit more, and the sound occasionally left something to be desired - all in all, it is a fun movie that I love to watch often.My one question is...what is the name of the song at the VERY end of the movie? When Max & Eli are walking on the rocks? Who is the artist? Unfortunately, the credits do not reflect this song at all. Anyone out there have any ideas?Thanks, L"
2,"Great filmography, horrible acting","I have watched many gay/lesbian films, and I have to say that this is the worst one I have seen so far. It does have some great indie cinematography, and it is not your traditional lesbian story (cute girl finding love where she least expects it... with a homely older woman). But I could not get passed the horrific acting. Guinevere Turner, who plays the lead as ""Max"" does well as an actress, but for the most part, the rest of the cast seems to have the acting skills of junior high students performing a play. Dialogue seems obviously scripted and memorized, which just makes it unbelievable and obnoxious. It was painful to watch. If you are just going to rent this movie at your local video store, then I suppose it is worth the three dollars, but if you are thinking about purchasing the DVD, save your money. Show Me Love, Gia, Better Than Chocolate, and If These Walls Could Talk, are much better choices."
4,One of my favorites,"This movie is endearing. The characters are fresh and real and I found myself drawn to all of them. In fact, some of my favorites were secondary characters. The interweaving of the fantasy and reality sequences made the film so honest."
1,B&W with no entertainment...,I only made it through 15 minutes of this movie before I decided this was not something I wanted to waste precious minutes of my life watching. It's B&W but there is no artistic reason for it to be filmed that way. The acting is horrible. The dialog ridiculous. The cover has a very nice picture... unfortunately that's the only good thing about this movie.
2,has its place,"This film is alright as part of queer cinema history, but in and of itself is plagued by innumerable flaws. It is slow moving and boring. The constant skipping about makes it hard to follow. In general, it's just uninteresting and flat. There are many far better queer films out there, leave this one alone."
1,Why did they make this Movie ?,"What a pile of CRAP.I saw this movie when it first came out.I watched it twice because I thought Imust have missed something.I didn't !!!It is a self absorbed,self indulgent,BORING piece of crap .It looks like it was made by someonewho new nothing about a camera letalone camera angles.Then there's the idea that a woman shouldhit on another woman who she finds physicallyrepugnant and if she doesn't she should considerherself a superficial ,shallow person.I guess the author doesn't know the differencebetween friends and lovers."
3,not as bad as the reviews make it out to be,"I recently bought a copy because I saw it for sale for $2 at a flea market. I had been curious to watch it, but kind of put off by all the negative reviews printed here. The reality? The movie is definitely not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. The acting is ok, except for Guin Turner, who really does seem like she's reading off cue cards. The storyline is amazing, and the girls seem like real lesbians, versus Hollywood's idea of what a lesbian is supposed to look like (i.e., blonde, thin, femme). There is such a variety of lesbians here: black, Spanish, white, butch, femme, and in-between. The black and white gives it a nice artistic quality. Definitely worth a look."
1,Oh my god! Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!,"Let me start by saying; Two weeks ago, I made a decision to learn as much as possible about lesbian lifestyle as possible through movies. To date I have purchase about 7 films, All pretty good, but this one scared me to be honest. I just did not get it. What this movie did for me is completely understand why professionals make movies instead of people that just might know something about the subject. Ugly; extremely! I don't think you could have depicted girls in any dimmer light. Scary!"
4,Judging by the cover...,"...Once I got over the fact that the cover and the movie seemed to be entirely un-related, I really enjoyed this movie. From the ""who is gay?"" conversation (face it - don't we all do that?) to the love in unexpected places theme and the interwoven stories of the different characters - I thought this movie was really worth watching."
3,Black and White Story,A doco-style story of attracted each to other females and their deliberations related covered same gender affairs and possibility to play with men.A bit boring if even some scences somehow included for a few minutes in.
1,Dissapointing,"This movie wasn't what I expected at all. Get ""Better Than Chocolate"" or ""Bound"" instead you'll be much happier."
2,Home Movie Time!,"This is a two hour home movie made by a lesbian and some of her friends. It's amateurish in every sense of the word. To describe the acting as cardboard would be to insult the charisma of shipping boxes. However, it's watchable despite its non-existent budget, condenscending script, and extremely untalented cast.The plot: Pretty Gwen Turner finds happiness with a woman who looks just like the ""Stork"" from ""Animal House.""Word of warning to guys cruising the video store for lesbian soft porn: Do not be fooled by the cover of this video. It's not lesbian soft-porn, but a black-and-white, pseudo-art film. Also with the exception of Ms. Turner- the rest of the cast, all female, are extremely unattractive. Although, the ""Stork's"" high-and-tight haircut does improve her looks- a little."
5,One Of The Best Soprano Compilation CDs Ever,"This is one of my favorite CDs. I don't usually publicize my opinions, but the one-star review on this page so offended me that I need to raise the average back up to five stars where it belongs. I'm still in shock by the careless mischief of that anonymous criminal.Beautiful music, beautiful singing, beautiful song selection, beautiful pacakging, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!"
2,When all else fails... keep re-releasing the same material.,"Who needs another Greatest Hits/Best of compilation? If you've never heard of the Mish, you probably aren't reading this anyway. If you are a fan, you have all the albums so this is useless, especially since all the songs are the ALBUM versions. Even if you find yourself enomoured with the artwork, you don't really need this. And if you are some kind of completist/fanatic... why not find a hobby that will do some good in the world? Or at least one that will make you feel better about yourself."
5,The necessary purchase for all Mission Lovers,"Hello, If you are a fan of The Mission and the legendary Wayne Hussey, you must buy this CD; of course it's not the first ""best of"" they released, but lovers don't count .."
3,internet information in a book,you can find the information found in this book via the internet... the only thing i found this book good for is to convince the obvious: venture capital business is big business.also get to know who the big-wigs are in the business... which can be discovered on the internet... check out redherring.com and subscribe to the VC p.s. newsletter.
2,Bo-ring. VCs have great stories. Too bad they can't write.,"I believe the big mistake of this book is that the VCs did write their own stories. This means 2 things: (1) you're reading the same things over and over again and (2) the writing isn't all that good. If the author had access to all these great people and told their stories for them, we may have gotten something more interesting."
2,old news,"I was disappointed with this book. Rather than a behind the scenes look into the strategy and excitement of today's dealmaking, it is a look into the past (poorly edited)of several VCs really not relating to their current successes. Better historical perspective in ""The Big Deal"" by Wasserstein and better strategy in ""Winning at M&A"" by Clemente and Greenspan."
3,Only Browsing,No chance to read this book thoroughly. Three Star Rating is provisional. Sampling this book revealed the author to be unique.Goodrich's narrative of his life and his house reminded me of a classic PBS documentary. PBS documentary was original inasmuch as it showed sequences from a man's existence in the wilderness. This accompanied by voiceovers from the man's diary.Charles Goodrich's narrative might be considered to be a sequel to or at least in the same family as the drama aired on PBS.larchak
4,Well made- kids love it!,We just purchased this set for our pool. It was a bit pricey but the quality is worth it. It looks nice and it's durable. Very happy with it!
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this product to increase my breastmilk flow, as I read reviews of how it has worked for many others. It didn;t work for me. I got it in a timely manner after ordering and nothing was wrong with the product, it just did not work for me."
3,Not too sure it worked...,"I bought it thinking it may work better than my Gaia lactation support pills and I dont think it worked any better..went back to my Gaia pills since those worked before along with NuMom Breast Milk Enhancer, my 3 month old seems to be satisfied enough with this combination."
5,LOVE THIS!!! It works GREAT,"I absolutely love that this product actually works!!! I have PCOS and have not had enough milk for my previous two pregnancies, and the lactation consultant recommended that I try this. I have been taking one drop each morning, and have been able to nurse my baby now for a couple months and am able to pump out an extra bottle each morning for times that I am unable to be with my baby! I am actually able to stock pile up some milk for once! Thank you!!!"
4,"Yucky, but WORTH IT!","This product tastes gross, right off the bat. I'll admit it. But quite frankly the stuff works.How I managed to get it down is to put my serving size in a shot glass, filled with juice or soda. And honestly, it only tastes gross for a few seconds. I noticed a change in my milk supply that same day. I'm not one of those women looking to pump and store a whole lot extra, I just wanted enough milk to suffice what my baby needed, and it worked.Also, I had tried taking Fenugreek to increase my milk supply and it caused my newborn awful gas. I haven't noticed this liquid blend doing that.I'd recommend this product, and I'll continue to use it myself."
2,yuck,"this product was so gross..i had to choke it down and it didnt help me produce more, though i followed the directions..eventually i just had my doctor put me on reglan which was cheaper and actually helped lol so- no go..just ask the doctor for something"
5,"doesn't taste THAT bad, works well","I had trouble getting my milk production going, and started out with some pills to help, but wasn't seeing results. I ordered the drops and they have helped tremendously! The drops have a licoricy/herbal taste, but if you just squeeze it in your mouth quickly and swallow, it isn't that big of a deal. It is worth it to have the increased milk production! I haven't tried the other version with alcohol, honestly I don't know what the difference would be or why the alcohol is needed, so I'll be sticking to the alcohol free. It was shipped quickly, and packed in bubble wrap. The bottle is glass so I was glad they packed it so well!"
3,fenugreek is better,for me it didn't really work out. i have tried eating oatmeal and fenugreek as well. the fenugreek seems to work the best. it may be different for everyone so give it a try if you have tried everything else.
5,It works!!!,"I was having a hard time producing enough milk, as I did with my last child, but with the help of More Milk my milk supply increased, and now I breastfeed exclusively. It takes a while to kick in, but it works."
4,"A neat ""new"" way to listen to music recordings","This release of Three of Beethoven's Piano Sonatas is the first of a new type from DG and Schott's the disc plays in either your CD player or your CD-Rom Drive and is encoded with the scores for the pieces on the recording. Which is an interesting idea, as for the perofrmances Pollini as ususal plays these works quite well.The Cd-Rom part of the disc will be useful for music teachers and students alike."
2,True Story ?,"I have since found that this story is a fraud. If you read it, it will become quite obvious that this is so. This story is obviously concocted. Annd who remembers dialog in such detail years later? Obviously it was written with the hopes of being made into a movie but the movie was never made. Gibson and the co-author both did prison time for fraud. If you look at it as a work of fiction, it's a good read. But I wouldn't quote it."
4,"great, but it's not water-tight","I bought 2 of these to put under the kitchen sink; one for compost, one for recycling bottles and cans. They work well, and are a perfect use for plastic grocery bags, but be aware that if your grocery bags have holes in them (mine often seem to), any 'juiciness' from your garbage can leak from the seam around the bottom of the can and onto the floor of your cabinet. Maybe my cans are improperly made, but I ordered each one at a different time, and they both have this 'feature'. Finally I realized that I could use some siliconized acrylic caulk to fix this issue. I'm waiting for the caulk to dry right now, so I can say whether I've fixed the problem, but I'm pretty confident this should work."
5,"Expensive to buy, Cheap to operate","Perfect for using grocery bags rather than store bought trash bags. It is easy to load a grocery bag, it fits very nicely, use of grocery bags is more environmentally friendly than throwing them away and purchasing store bought. A plus and a minus is the small size of grocery bags. You won't have garbage sitting around as long if you use the small size grocery bags for liners. On the other hand, you may end up having to empty the trash can more than you would like and you can't fit large items into such a small trash can. Furthermore the can is expensive to buy. For applications where it fits perhaps it will pay for itself over time. If you are already stretching grocery bags over a too big trash can having one designed precisely to use those bags as liners will be a blessing."
4,Great for using grocery bags!,"Most average sized bags will fit this. Not the greatest choice of styles, and too small for my kitchen, but works well in other parts of the house where it's small enough to tuck almost out of sight."
2,Small,"For some reason I thought this was larger, way too small for my apartment kitchen. Its not touchless or automatic; the only good thing is that the handles from small plastic bags from the grocery store will fit around each side. I would have liked it better if it had a lid. Expensive for what you get."
3,Two Singing Cowboys for the Price of One!,"An engaging Gene Autry musical-western that clocks in at 54 minutes. Directed with breezy flair by Joseph Kane, ""The Old Corral"" (1936) features plenty of action, Smiley Burnette's comic relief, plus an early appearance by Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers (who sing ""Down Along the Sleepy Rio Grande"" and ""Silent Trails""). It's also great to see Lon Chaney Jr. play a slimy henchman three years before his screen breakthrough in ""Of Mice and Men."" Republic's ""B movie"" craftsmanship provides the ideal showcase for America's Favorite Singing Cowboy."
3,A little small,"I like this item. The face is beautiful. I just wanted it to feel a little more substantial in my hand. It is a little on the small side, and not very heavy at all."
2,Not Keegan's best work,"I'll start this review by saying that John Keegan is one of my favorite authors. With that in mind, I try to collect as many of his books as I can find. Unfortunately, this book is a product of the early '70s Ballantine days for JK. So he's in full-on dry professorial tone here. Heck, I still haven't been able to get through his account of Barbarossa in the same series! Avoid this one unless you're a Keegan completist."
5,rive gauche by yves st. laurent,A refined special fragance. I use it already 20 years and that's enough to say.It's me.The other product like mascara and eyeliner from YSL are also perfect. It's a must.
2,Esoteric,"I was pleased to hear upon completing this book that Nathaniel Mackey has more or less given himself over to writing poetry which I think is a smart move because his srange writing style (which places emphasis on sound) is far more suitable for poetry than prose. This novel, is the third installment of a trilogy about a traveling jazz band that is presented in letter form and has an off the wall weird mixture of music, myth, etymology, and surrealism. Unfortunately, for readers like me de-emphasis on story and character is always a serious handicap. It seems that Mackey is most interested with proving to his readers that he's an intellectual. Perhaps I just misunderstood this book, and maybe I would like it better if I read it again, but I just f ound it overly pretentious and ultimately unapproachable. There is a large following of literature buffs who swear it is masterful, but I can't imagine the average casual reader being anything but annoyed by this one."
4,Wonderful for kids,"My children watch this dvd over and over! Hearing the children sing, and play. the songs are easy to learn and fun to sing. I put this dvd in while my kids are playing, and I am cleaning the house. And we all end up singing this positive up lifting songs!"
2,A spaghetti sci-fi snoozer,"Battle of the Worlds (I watched the VHS version) had both good and bad (really) features. Claude Raines, who was hot in the 1930's (Invisible Man), was quite the eccentric mathematician in this low budget Italian attempt at star wars. A mix of both Italian and American actors produced some entertaining voice overs to keep it in english. The acting is pretty rigid and the military emphasis is rather stilted. The film was shot in color for the earth scenes but the shots of outer space are all black and white. However, once they reach the ""Outsider"" planet and enter into its core, some fairly interesting color schemes emerge. I only paid [$$] for this one. I guess you get what you pay for!"
3,Planetary Lapse Of Reason...,"Watch Claude Rains devour every piece of scenery as Dr. Benson, in this slow, yet somehow watchable space epic. Benson is the only scientist who seems to have a brain, and must overcome the idiots around him in order to deal with a rogue planet from another galaxy! Yes, said planet has entered our solar system and is heading toward the earth! It will soon be close enough to destroy all life! Worse still, the mysterious orb is loaded with killer flying saucers that thwart all attempts to investigate the planet! Can Benson find a way to get to the electronic brain at the planet's core before doomsday? Watch and see! BOTWs boasts special FX that are straight out of some poor kid's toybox! The story is nearly motionless at times and the characters (except for Benson) are petrified wood. However, I find myself enjoying it anyway! Am I sick or what?? Check it out..."
2,Battle to stay awake...,"Boring Italian flick dubbed into English starring the great Claude Rains as an eccentric scientist charged with saving the Earth from the mysterious ""Outsider"", a rogue planet full of flying saucers on a collision course with our own. Rains does his best to carry the picture, but he doesn't have much help. You would think such material wouldn't lend itself to boredom. Until the final scenes within the alien world, somehow the director and cast pull it off. Some accomplishment. The effects are fairly laughable, even by 1961 standards. For those wishing to see an Italian science fiction movie from this era with an engaing story and good acting, look no further than ""Assignment: Outer Space"". It's available in the same Tree Line Sci-Fi Classics package as BOTW, along with truly great schlock like Teenagers From Outer Space, Mesa of Lost Women and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians."
2,pyle audio,The wired remote does not work. I e-mailed support twice and have not got a response back from them. My wife got this for me for Christmas 2012.I guess i will try to call and see what happens. Getting a litte put out about it.
2,remote does not work,the remote does not work like it should. i unpluged and pluged it in many time and each time it was something different.....
2,No MP3 Capability,"Sound quality was good & everything seemed to work OK, but the unit I got simply would not ply MP3 CDs. WMA discs played fine. No reply from Pyle to my e-mail asking for assistance."
1,broke,The wired remote cable came broke was only able to tune 4 stations even after a new antenna. The radio was returned Pyle support was slow to respond
4,Review,"Seems to work good. The manual is lacking in describing the best way to set up a disc with MP3 files. It also plays WMA files, but does not tell you that. Great boat stereo for the price. The wired remote is good for applications (like boats) where the stereo might be mounted out of sight and reach. Not sure why they don't just make wireless remotes that don't require line of sight to function instead of the wired version. Routing a wire through your boat can be difficult."
3,comedy,The video was enjoyable when I saw it many years ago but this purchase was a birthday gift. I consider the DVD to be fluff and I purchased it for someone who enjoys lighthearted fluff.
2,library reject,"Although, the dvd did actually work. It looked like hell in a hand basket! It still had the stickers from the public library from which it was bought for a nickle! the disc itself looked like it had spent an hour in disk doctor tool. It was sanded beyond belief. Again, it did work which the most important thing. I just felt ripped off ten dollars (price plus shipping)."
4,This is the movie that makes you laugh 'til you need surgery,"While Nancy Travis plays a vapid love interest, and the ending lacks the punch for which you were hoping, Mike Myers makes this movie fly with his comedic rhythm and insanely funny portrayal of his character's Scottish father. A must-see for Scots, Beatniks, and Myers fans."
5,A Witfully Funny Comedy!!,"This is one of the funniest movies made, as it incorporates comedy with wit. Many of the funny scenes are take-off's on other movies or TV shows, such as ""Midnight Run"", an episode from ""Tales From the Crypt"", and ""Starsky and Hutch"". Mike Meyers provides many laughs. It's one of my favorite movies."
3,Quite uneven but Myers' wit saves the day.,"A similar plot to Hitchcock's ""Suspicion"", ""SIMAAM"" is harmless fun with a few twists and turns which should keep you away from the fast forward button. Mike Myers can become a little irritating especially with the catchphrase ""Hello"" overused in inappropriate places. Tony La Paglia and especially Alan Arkin play their roles with the right amount of panache and timing. All in all, not a bad effort, but certainly not Myers' best work by any stretch of the imagination."
4,Evolving Origins.,"Mike Myers stars in this film as a guy named Charlie who has a phobia about marriage and finds off-the-wall reasons for breaking up with his girlfriends (one was a mobster, another smelled like soup, another was a cleptomaniac, etc.). Then one day he visits a world meat shop and meets a beautiful butcher. The two begin to date and Charlie thinks he's found the one. Of course, there is the possibility she could be a mysterious axe-murderer known as Mrs. X. Nah. Well, maybe.Nancy Travis is a delight to watch in this film as Myer's love interest. However, the real star of the show is Myers. Though his performance often distracts from the pace of the movie, he is stil a blast to watch. In watching this film one can see how all the various characters of the Austin Powers movies originated and evolved. A fun date movie."
4,Ms. Right/Dead Wrong,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen, this is the story of a man who thinks he has met Ms. Right, and then becomes ever more certain that she will literally be the death of him. I can't tell you more without giving away the story, but suffice it to say that in the deft hands of Mike Myers and Nancy Travis -- and how do you beat that casting? -- this story is tears-running-down-your-cheeks funny."
4,So I married An Axe Murderer,"Just like all the other reviews, this movie is a must have. I had to get it on DVD so as to have easier access to my favorite scenes.... I highly recomend adding this movie to your collection."
4,Underrated Classic,"This past week, as we were driving around San Francisco, a friend asked if we had ever seen this movie. ""Of course."" I answered. He then informed us that the whole thing is set in San Francisco and we rewatched it while all of the locations were fresh in our minds.Mike Meyers toes the line between giddy lack of self-awareness and perfectly delivered satire. You can even see the prototypes for some of his Austin Powers characters is his use of accents and facial expressions. Nancy Travis plays her part flawlessly. And what's not to like about a wedding scene with a bagpipe playing ""Scotland the Brave""?Honestly, this film has so many great lines and memorable scenes, it's not surprising that it has become a cult classic."
2,Not one of his best....,"I like Mike Myers but this movie was not really funny at all. I laughed maybe twice, and wouldn't watch it again."
4,"Great Flick, Poor DVD","A cute, funny movie that I still enjoy each time I see it.Sadly, the transfer from film to DVD left a lot to be desired. When played on properly-calibrated equipment, it's dimmer than Dark City, which was supposed to be that way. Hopefully the distributor will re-master and re-press it."
5,I'm not kiddin' that boy's head's like Sputnik!,"This movie had me literally rolling on the floor for hours. My freinds and I had to rewind and watch the scene with the Father numerous times each time we watched it.If you have ever lauged at Mike Myers' Scotish humour... this movie is for you!""Oooo I hated the colonel... with his wee beady eyes... and that smug look on his face... ooo you're gonna buy my chicken... oooo!"""
5,gerr eight,"This movie is funny all the way. All the characters are great. It's got mystery and suspense on top of the comedy. It's Mike Myers brand of comedy without re-using any stuff from ""Wayne's World""."
5,So I Married an Ax Murderer,This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Pay attention to a small things going on around the main charecters.
4,What can I say? Mike Myers....,"I saw this movie on tv recently and had to have it on DVD. Mike Myers is hilarious...and the beautiful Nancy Travis sweetens the deal. My friends and I occasionally repeat some of the funny lines from this movie, so...it's a must-have for my collection. Downside: no special features....like a gag-reel, etc.. C'mon....this is Mike Myers we're talking about....there have got to be some outtakes (which should have been included). I believe this movie was out on VHS first, so...maybe they weren't doing outtakes back then(???). Funny movie."
5,We've got a piper down,"I may have to start dividing the world into two categories: those who love this movie and those who don't. Yes, Mike Myer's stand up routine can get a bit old but PLEASE don't tell me that the Scottish Dad bit is stale. Myer's playing the dad is totally what makes this movie--that and a great supporting cast. Alan Arkin does a wonderful cameo, Phil Hartman is a riot and (I'm afraid I don't know her name) the actress who plays the mom is a joy to watch. In my opinion it's a cult classic. The wanna-be beat poetry is pretty good too. Is this Casablanca? Well, no--but it's dang entertaining."
2,Movie doesn't work after first time. :(,"So as a fan of this movie since it came out, I upgraded to have it on Blu-Ray and watch it in high definition on my 52"" screen, as my old DVD is sorely dated.#1 0 special features, that really sucked, couldn't even put the trailer from the first DVD on there?#2 I can't get it to play again. I watched it once, and it has some kind of loading screen when starting, but after watching it last night when I bought it, it will no longer start, it comes up with the loading screen and never goes past it.Buyer beware, this is on the Sony PS3 with the latest firmware (2.36)"
3,"Weird, that's all I can say is weird.....","This movie is Weird, but in a funny way. It has somewhat of an original plot line and has a few good jokes here and there, but for the most part this movie was weird. If you're just becoming a Mike Myers fan or something like that I reccomend you check out Wayne's World and stuff like that before watching this movie, because this movie is truly for the die hard fans who are really into the comedy of Mike Myers."
4,This movie...sucks.,"Let's face it. No one is going to mistake this movie for one of the all-time greats. In fact, as a whole it is a rather weak flick. But that doesn't stop it from being one of my favorite guilty pleasures. The highlight of the movie is Mike Myers as an old wiley Scotsman who proclaims his distrust of the Colonel (yes, THAT one) while throwing verbal abuse upon his son with a rather large cranium (It's like an orange on a toothpick). This movie flopped in the theaters, but I do not know of one person in their mid-twenties who does not hail this movie as good dumb fun. Check it out. It may surprise you."
5,Stranger Days,this movie is great! I got it for my girlfriend and I on valentines day shes into horror and I'm into comedy so it seemed to bring both of our worlds together in this classic Mike Meyers film. :) Highly recommended
5,Great romantic comedy,"Loved it. Mike Meyers and Nancy Travis had great chemistry. Great movie, I would recommend 100%. Also has a great supporting cast."
4,A Missed Myers Classic,Mike Myers again playing multiple roles again does it hilariously. You have to enjoy this kind of humor. And you will get some classic lines from this movie that can be used over and over.
5,Mike Myers before Austin Powers...,"I absolutely love this movie! Mike Meyers to me was funny before Austin Powers and though he may have been ""excellent"" in Wayne's World he really brought a sense of family to this movie. Although most of us don't have relatives trying to axe us you could tell he was trying to emulate what his parents felt for one another. The supporting roles were well played by a cast of talented actors and Mike Myers playing his father sets you up for his Austin personas. I think this was a real ""test the waters"" film for him. All in all I believe it's a must see. If you've seen Austin Powers and watch this movie you will see the early correlations, and don't worry if you thought Austin Powers wasn't ""a bit of alright"", this movie doesn't spew outlandish overtures left and right. It's good honest humor."
3,A Downright Classic...,"I love this movie. Most of the movie is just...alright, but the movie is worth the price just for the scene where Charlie goes to his parents' house and we get to meet his weird Scottish father. The story is pretty much the same as a million other movies that we've seen in our lives, but it's a lot of fun."
3,A Pretty Good Movie.,"I remember seeing this when it was first released. Not the greatest film, but not bad either. Mike Myers does a good job in his role. Worth a watch."
4,Best Mike Myers comedy,"My personal favorite, this movie has lots of laughs, a great plot and the lovely Nancy Travis. What else do you need?"
3,Pure silliness,"I bought this movie only for the scenes in which Mike plays his Dad, an angry Scotsman whose other son has large, red Afro hair. It is worth it, to me, to own the movie just to watch these scenes."
4,"If you don't buy it, go rent it.","This is a great movie. I loooooooooooove Mike Myers, he cracks me up every time I see him. Any movie with him in it is guarenteed to be a good one. You should buy this, because even if you just watch it once, you should have it around to show guests!"
4,Hysterical and witty A++,"If you like Mike Myers, and you like to laugh, this movie is a classic best bet ! So many great lines and a good story line too. One of my top 10."
1,Not a Special Edition!!!,"Buyer Beware! I love this movie and give the movie five stars. However, this new re-release is NOT a special edition. There are no extras at all. Not even the trailer for the movie. It does offer several trailers for other movies and an anamorphic widescreen transfer, but that's nothing special and is standard on most DVDs. If this movie is a special or deluxe edition then every DVD is a special or deluxe edition and we need a new name for DVDs that include such things as audio commentary, documentaries, featurettes, still galleries and trailers. Calling this release of ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" a special edition is false advertising and the marketing hustlers at Sony who are responsible for selling this hoax should be called on this and be held accountable. Their integrity is seriously called into question and they need to take a course on ethics. I'm returning my copy of this movie for a refund."
5,Funny without being overbearing,"One year after ""Wayne's World"" and 3 years before ""Austin Powers"" Mike Myers made this pleasant movie. It's funny without being in your face like the ""Austin Powers"" series, it has some sort of broad appeal unlike ""Wayne's World"" which I personally liked but not everybody would have appreciated. You actually can see some embryonic ""Austin Powers"" style characters in it. Does anybody in it remind you of ""Shrek"" at all? Think carefully. MM plays Charlie,a neurotic but likable young comedian/poet. He also plays his hilarious father,a way over the top stereotypical scotsman. If I was scottish I wouldn't really know how to take him. But MM is of Scottish descent, so he's entitled to poke fun at himself. The movie is funny, exciting, the plot moves well and keeps you there until the end,and the choice of ""There She Goes"" (2 Different versions) was an excellent choice of theme song. Lets see more of this sort of thing Mike!"
2,Good information buried in fluff,"This author needs to take two classes at whichever university she teaches: (1) instructional design and (2) writing concisely. This book has quite a lot of good information, but it is all buried within convoluted fluff.There are many other books on research methodology that (a) do a better job of explaining, (b) include more comprehensive rules for research, and (c) don't take up so much of your valuable time with fluff. I recommend you look at those other books -- especially if you are a professor who is choosing a book for your students."
2,won't be buying these again,"while the pant was an excellent cut and a nice fit, my husband does not like the material of the pant they collect lint and losses its color after one wash. buyers beware!!"
5,Great Recording!,"I've always enjoyed Dvorak's Slavonic Dances, but this sprited rendition has made them a favorite with my children, as well. A very accessible, fun recording, for both those who know Dvorak and classical music well, and the neophyte."
1,Doesn't Pass The Smell Test,"Leave it to a ""journalist"" to opine, speculate, and exagerate an exceptional glitch in the Long Grey Line. Peee-uuu. Hold your nose."
4,Light-hearted and easy reading,"John writes another humorous, easy reading book that makes you take a look at how you interact with the world through his own shortcomings and hangups as a human being."
4,Almost a great soundtrack!,"All I can say is why the Sixpence None the Richer version of Dancing Queen on the soundtrack instead of ABBA's origianl version??? Was it not the ABBA version that they were skating and dancing to at the end??? I believe it was, duh??? So why put the slow downbeat version, that was a complete and total let-down, on the album??? I love Sixpence None the Richer, but they totally destroyed Dancing Queen...."
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!,"I am 15 years old and I have got to say, this is the BEST soundtrack EVER made! I didn't even live through the 70s and I just LOVE the music. I STRONGLY recommend it to all teenagers! In my opinion, it's A LOT better than the music made nowadays! Just try it out. You don't gotta buy the cd, but at least download some of the songs! I PROMISE you will like at least one, if not all. :)"
2,Should have put ABBA on the sountrack,"What is the point of Abba music without swedish accents? Well, OK I like Erasures ""Abbaesque"", but other than that everyone should definitely stick with the original stuff. Whatever the reason for including the cover version on here, it wasn't a good one. There are a lot of other fun songs though, but this release is fundamentally flawed. Both the ABBA version and this lame cover were in the movie. Why put only the cover version on the soundtrack? Why even ever record this useless cover version?"
4,funky funky funky,"What a glorious piece of cheese this is! A couple of years ago I was one of those people who detested '70s pop, mostly because everyone else did. When I actually heard some of the stuff, courtesy of the soundtracks from ""Boogie Nights"" and ""54,"" I quickly reversed my decision. While those two discs dealt more with the disco/club scene side of the '70s, the soundtrack for ""Dick"" is a glorious look back at the teenybopper hits of yesteryear.Looking at the tracks, you may be thinking, ""David Essex, Blue Swede, Grand Funk Railroad? Who the heck are they?"" Well, they were the Ricky Martins, Britney Spears, and N-SYNC of their generation. They didn't get any respect then, just as our teen idols don't get any respect now. Whether or not they deserve respect is a moot point; fact is, then (as now) the stuff is damn easy on the ears.Try getting through the ""Dick"" CD without cracking a smile, tapping your toes, or humming along: I dare you. Can't do it, can ya!:o)"
1,Contains Remixes,"Beware that this album contains remixes!My two favorite singles - I'm in the Mood and Finally - are remixes; not very good remixes to boot. If you are looking for original releases, do not purchase this item. I am so disappointed."
5,a very essential collection!,"I own this CD and I mainly bought it because of how many tracks there are on this, as I already own her ""Best Of"" album which only has 13 tracks (but great dance mixes and new photos made Best Of worth the purchase). This album Essential is very good. It has all Ce Ce's greatest hits including ""Finally"" (original '91 mix), ""We Got A Love Thang"" (Radio Party Mix), ""Keep On Walkin'"" (Radio Mix), ""Keep Givin' Me Your Love"" (West End Radio Mix), ""I'm In The Mood"" (Bad Yard Club Edit), ""and ""It Should Have Been You"" (LP Edit). The rare versions of her popular hits make this CD worth the buy, and the fact that you get 18 tracks! A complete full collection of her essential hits! If you don't own any of her albums, then I strongly recommend you pick this one up today! You can only get this CD online. I believe the stores don't have it, so make essential your next buy!"
3,Somewhat insightful,"Not as interesting as I'd hoped it would be, only somewhat insightful. Still I find him a quality thinker and good family man."
3,Movie review,"I was very anxious to see this movie, hoping I guess for some insight into Deepak's life. I was a bit disappointed. While there were some revelations I really did end with a sense that I knew any more than I did before watching."
3,FASCINATING film about Deepak Chopra,"I enjoyed this movie and the rare glimpses into Deepak's personal life. If you're interested in Deepak Chopra - he's also in the movie, SEROTONIN RISING with the Dalai Lama. This is another excellent film about how kindness can make you happier and healthier."
3,"Thumbs Up for Gotham, Thumbs Down for Deepak","As a former reader of Chopra's books, I've found issue with Deepak's mounting celebrity. This film exposes the man in front of the myth... a bit difficult to take him seriously as he accepts monkhood while refusing to lay off the Blackberry. It's a little unpalatable yet interesting to behold. Good one on Gotham for dispelling mystery and illuminating, instead, just another man good at his craft."
5,Amazing movie!,"This is not the new age documentary you might expect- it's a moving father/son story that follows a year in the life of the global guru Deepak Chopra as told by his filmmaker son Gotham. It's got appearances by everyone from Russell Simmons to Lady Gaga, Lucy Liu, Darren Aronofsky, and Diane Von Furstenberg(!?). Along the way Deepak gets ordained as a Thai Buddhist monk, picks a fight on air with Bill O'Reilly, and develops his own XBox game. At one point Deepak even attempts to take over directing the film. So you could say he's all over the map- literally.The movie generated a lot of buzz as one of the headlining films at this year's SXSW festival."
5,Gautama Chopra your film rocked!,"Loved this brilliant docu-delving into the enigmatic Spiritual savant and author, Deepak Chopra--by none other that his oh so gifted son, Gautam. In this absorbing film you travel with them to Thailand, where Deepak becomes ordained as a Buddhist Monk. You travel with Deepak and Gautam to New Delhi, India to locate their ancestral roots and to various venues where Deepak is teaching and conducting seminars. You will experience the multi-faced aspects of a truly enlightened person and hear him continually expounding existential Vedic wisdom along his journey.You will also observe the delima this can pose for a Son who would simply like a personal relationship with his Father rather than sharing him with the millions world wide who see Dr. Deepak Chopra as a Guru figure. For anyone interested in exploring the deeper issues of life and the impact that one's Spiritual search can have on family relationships--you're going to enjoy this film. Ashtar-Athena Sheran"
3,Decoding Deepak,"I have been a big fan of Dr. Chopra since the early 90's and have read and enjoyed several of his books since. I was expecting the movie to show from Gotham's point of view, more about who he really is. Sadly, I found this documentary to reflect that Dr. Chopra is indeed self absorbed, and has more interest in selling books and making TV appearances then I ever would have believed. What I did find interesting though, is that Dr. Chopra admits that he really doesn't have all the answers and seems to be like so many of us, on an endless quest to figure it all out. As he grows older, his urgency to do so has become more intense and has at times left him second guessing himself. I hope he takes the time to appreciate his family and live more in the moment then he actually does."
4,cute film!,"I rented this on Amazon and enjoyed watching it. I'm glad Gotham made this film. Deepak is an interesting character, because of the fact that he's had so much success you have to wonder how the man behind the scenes compares to his media persona. Many people view Deepak as being like a new age televangelist, out to make money by selling BS. But this film protrays him as someone who is not pretensious his status as a ""spirtual guru"". My favorite part of the film was when Deepak seemed to be getting stressed and asks, ""Where is our luggage"", and Gotham quips, ""We're practicing accepting uncertainty""."
5,excellent!,"Plenty of room for two people, and plenty warm. Yes the carrying ""case"" is a tight fit but i had no troubles fitting it in by stuffing and twisting.Highly recommended and worth the extra $!!"
4,Worth every Penny,"I camp with my family four to six timesa a year......during summer thur winter....and there is nothing like a cold night and this sleeping bag provides a very spacious sleeping space for at least three persons. Love it....then why a four star.....well; it is quite bulky and heavy. Indeed a challenge to stuff it back in the original bag, but manageable....all in all....a great value. Enjoy."
5,Built for a Queen,"No one actually related to the size of this bag in standard terms. It is VERY close to a queen size bed in width and probably a little longer than a standard mattress. Perfect for two larger adults and a child and for more emergent situations could less comfortably accommodate 2 adults and 2 smaller children. The cushion is enough to sleep reasonably good without a pad underneath and this thing is super warm. Also dries quick from tent condensation do the synthetic liner (also stays cleaner than the flannel liner type) Don't be fooled though, even when compressed to the max its too large to be used as a trail bag. This bag and a ultralight 2 man tent on a hauler frame pack is all that one person could manage"
4,Great,"This is probably the best sleeping bag we have owned. It was a little bit bigger (packed) than expected, however, even though it was bought for a motorcycle road trip, it straps on nicely. Not too difficult to get it back in to storage bag, bag is sturdy."
5,Best discovery ever!,"My fiancé and I didn't think we could find a duo sleeping bag and when we discovered this bag we weren't too sure it was going to workout. People were raving about it, so we decided to try it out. It's a heavy bag so we cannot use it to backpack unfortunately, but I don't think I have ever slept that good in a sleeping bag before. It is absolutely amazing. Cushiony and warm and very spacious. We can eventually fit a family in there one day. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Best for cold camping as a couple!,"I wish I could give this 6 stars!This is the absolute best sleeping bag to snuggle up with someone when camping on a cold winter night.It's HUGE though. REALLY REALLY big! It does not pack down small at all!I would NOT recommend this for backpackers. But if you're car camping, you NEED this.One of the best camping purchases that I've made."
5,Excellent Car Camping Bag!!!,"This sleeping bag is awesome! My husband and I used to zip 2 sleeping bags together, but it never really worked. This does! We can tuck our pillows into the top, zip up each side independently, and stay warm and cozy all night. Our dog can even snuggle up in between us, on the top of the bag! Plenty of room!The flannel lining is so comfortable.This isn't a hiking bag. It weighs 16.7lbs, and measures 27 inches high by 15 wide when it's packed into it's stuff sack. But what a stuff sack this is! Support straps run up all 4 sides, which can be tightened and released easily, and double as a carrying straps."
2,different from ad images,"I bought this used one like new what i saw on the amazon display.(Maybe is this my mistake to buy 'used one'?)There are sevral image pictures in the bottom of main product. Even main mark is different!When i received it and found it something different i recognized. Inner matreal is not what i expect! It is just mixing normal polyester and kind of cotton stuff. The rope and end of holding button which mark on name ""Teton"". It dosn't seems cozy, and no air through.I just feel disapointed what i have done. I will buy product after deep considering about it. This time it make me unhappy."
4,The Sleeping Bag from Heaven!,"Ok all you camper nuts; if you like having your partner with you while you sleep in your bag, this is the bag for you!!!! OMG, its comfortable, it does require some effort to stow it. Other than that I would give it 5 stars."
2,Price was $100 not long ago,"Just a heads up, the price has risen from $99 to $180 in a few months! Most positive reviews give it this rating because it was at a much lower price point."
2,I rarely use this bad - do not buy.,This bag is extremely heavy and very difficult to travel with unless you have a huge vehicle and you don't mind in unfolding over everything. Everytime I try to stuff it back into the bag I am sweating and panting by the end and have usually inserted my entire body into the bag to try to push it all down. It does not come with straps so you cannot roll it either. I have tried to find some straps but no success thus far. Comfortable bag but I find myself never wanting to take it out of the bag - it's just not worth it.
1,Promising Title - Disappointing Treatment Of It,"On the surface this book held a promise of giving a balanced treatment of this subject. Unfortunately it is nothing more than yet another misquided opinion shouted from the rooftops. It is also disappointing to see the name of a well known evangelist of the past used as a platform, in an attempt to buy the author credibility. Overall this book promises the earth but gives no real content of substance."
2,"""Three different gynecologists have proposed marriage to her!""","Overly predictable story about a high school spaz who inherits a billion dollar porn company where apparently all the women don't take their clothes off too much.The crude AMERICAN PIE - style humor at the beginning is pretty funny but then it sinks into the goofy NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE territory and that got old quick. Add on a true meaning of friendship ending and you'll be praying for the end.WHO'S YOUR DADDY? should have stuck to one direction and went with it instead of failing at fifteen. Ali Landry is hot but I think Marnette Patterson is hotter. Neither gets naked, or even close."
3,Shy nice guy inherits money and becomes butthead...,I purchased this movie because it supposedly had Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia from Buffy and Angel) in it...I think maybe there was a half second flash of her way in the background surrounded by other women....perhaps her scenes were cut as sometimes happens.
4,A mildly humous adult oriented movie,I enjoyed the movie and found the humor midly funny. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because only once in the whole movie did I actually laugh. All the rest of the attempts at comedy prompted nothing more from me than a larg smile (but they did make me smile). Also this show is definetly not for kids under 17. I am sure most people can tell just by the name and the picture on the cover of the DVD.If you are a collector of comedy DVDs then this will be a good but not great addition to your library. Good Luck.
1,Wow! Quite bad.,This is like a crude disney movie with random bits of nudity.Why was this movie made?
1,Abysimal,One of the worst films of a generation. Many talented comedic (Dave Thomas - Colleen Camp) were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral.
4,Astrology and Sex,"Good stuff! So far, I've found it all to be true! I'm sure there's even more why's and wherefor's to in more books on this fascinating subject."
5,Good Experience,The overall experience was great the merchandise arrived timely a great overall experience.
4,A useful little reference,"While not comprehensive and tied to Kodak's product line, this photoguide is quite handy and compact. My favorite features are the wheels and other such devices that make the reference data much more accessible."
2,It's ok,This product is Ok. The songs are great but the original artist do not sing them. I was unaware of this.
4,Very good book,"My 9 year old's book club coordinator picked this for one of their selections. I read it (42 year old mom) to get a feel for what they are reading.The main character (a middle school girl) reminded me very much of my daughter - lots of drama. Gives a nice insight into that young brain we all used to have and the story resolves in a positive way.My daughter liked the style of the book -- written in letter (or email) form. It was grade appropriate, both in subject and in difficulty.She really liked the book, and I have to say I did, too."
3,An easy and entertaining read,This book took me two nights to read and I enjoyed it the same way someone might enjoy a movie like You've Got Mail. You knew what to expect but enjoyed it despite yourself.
1,Very Disappointing,"I had read the author's second book, Pink Slip, first and loved it, so I eagerly anticipated this novel. I thought it was terrible. In my opinion, none of the characters had any good qualities. paticularly Rosa and Gary. By the time I got through the book I didn't care what happened to them. Ms. Ciresi has a knack for writing about the most gross of bodily functions ad nauseum. Thank goodness Pink Slip was an improvement over this book, and that I read this one after it. I would not recommend this book!"
3,Mixed feelings,"While I commend this book as a good read, the subject matter depressed me SO much. An American-Italian girl,Rosa, is at loggerheads ALL of the time with her parents,especially her mother who never ceases her attempt at dominating her daughter.Rosa meets Gary, the only son of a wealthy Jewish couple and the joy of his mothers life.This unlikely pair marry,more as an attempt to escape the stranglehold that both sets of parents have on them. Their marriage in NOT an unqualified success but they are both struggling along until Rosa loses her baby and Gary is diagnosed with a terminal illness.I'm not giving away the plot as we are given this news on the book cover. Rosa in particular, goes from an unhappy childhood, through to an unhappy marriage and then, on to early widowhood. Hardly a joyous moment accurs throughout the story and, although in Rita Ciresi's great style, overall it's a terribly depressing book--not one to read if you're feeling a bit down!."
5,Keeps them busy!,"I bought a dozen of these for the goody bags for my daughter's fourth birthday party where Cinderella was the guest of honor. I also keep a couple in my bag (Cinderella, Cara the Cowgirl, others from the same series) for an instant fix for bored kids! They love them."
1,Overpriced,Book is very small and it is not worth paying the $3.50 when the book really sells for $1.50.
3,"DMX IS SO FINE, BUT HE LOOKS MEAN!","I LIKE ROUGH-RIDERS, BUT THAT'S MAINLY THE ONLY SONG THAT'S POPPIN"
5,A must read if you have ever been in love!!!,"I'm not usually attracted to love stories or poetry books, but this book literally made me cry. The poems are heartfelt and simple. The words, however, are powerful enough to bring out the deepest emotions from one's very heart and soul. A wonderful (but a little depressing) read..."
5,Exactly what I ordered.,I was very happy with my purchase. It's very hard to find these filters in stores so I was especially happy to see I could order them from Amazon.
4,Water filter replacement cartridge D-250A,"This my 5th set of these Culligan filters ordered from Amazon. They are easy to replace and filter the water so that it is crystal clear and tastes good, and they are also easy to replace. Only once did I get a defective shipment that wasn't packed properly - one of the carbon filters was cracked. Thanks to Amazing Amazon, I had a replacement before I had a chance to send back the broken filter. I have nothing but praise for the way Amazon treats it's customers and have been a recipient of their ""white glove"" service for a 56"" TV purchased there(big purchase) Sounds like I work for them doesn't it? Not true, never have; just an appreciative pleased customer."
1,level 4?,I ordered level 4 and it was not delivered. The filters are D-250A but are only rated to reduce bad taste and setiment. The level 4 is good for taking out much more.
4,GE substitute filters,"These filters are a great replacement for the GE ""FXSVC"" filters with a cost saving especially if ordered using the subscribe and save option."
1,Don't buy,The company charges more for these Culligan D-250A filtersbut ships the cheeper non Culligan brand filters.So u may as well just buy the cheeper non Culligan brand filter.In fact after this experience I am not sure I would trust anything on Amazon again.especially since both filters are listed by the same company on Amazon ... so its a bait and switch.
5,Culligan Water Filter set,Amazon sent me exactly what I wanted at a good price. Excellent service and follow-up. Would recommend product purchases from Amazon to anyone.
3,Jury's Out,"I previously read unfavorable reviews regarding these filters that are now being made in China. Not being able to find comparable ones made in the U.S., I ordered them. One came with the green cap broken apart from its body. Not wanting to wait for a replacement I carefully placed it in the system and am using it. I'm not a scientist so I don't know if this product is filtering as it's supposed to, but I was disappointed to find that it arrived broken. If anyone has an American-made alternative for this product, I'd like to know."
4,Sturdy yet Small,"Excellent item, but it doesn't hold all of my books! If it was 2 ft. taller and had 2 more shelves, it'd b beyond 5 stars.Tip: use a drill rather than a screwdriver for assembly."
5,Beautiful!,"Easy to put together, just right for the corner I needed to fill. Cheaper ones out there, but I can guarantee they are not the quality product this is. Well made, sturdy, beautiful piece of furniture."
3,Not a first choice,"I once heard a lot of Mahler at the CSO conducted by Solti, Giulini, Tennstedt and others. While Boulez is a fine technician he lacks the ""soul"" in Mahler. The music is clean and well played. The CSO could hardly play it poorly. But the music lacks the depth that is written into the notes. I feel that Chailly, Giulini and the 1938 Walter recordings come closer to realizing how Mahler meant this music to be played. There is, of corse, the three Bernstein readings. I grew up with the NYP recording. I have to dismiss the DG recording...too indulgent. Yet, the Berlin recording he did is quite good. If you can tolerate the poor sound the old Walter reading is my first choice followed by Chailly's wonderful new recording."
2,YOU CAN FIND BETTER ...,"Sorry, Pierre: This recording doesn't compare to the new recording by Christoph von Dohnanyi and The Cleveland Orchestra (London/Decca), which is also available through Amazon.com. There, you'll find finer orchestral playing, a more involved conductor, richer sound ... and better Mahler."
3,"Greatly promising, but damaged.","This recording is 3/4ths of an extraordinary performance of this symphony. The first movement is perhaps one of the finest ever recorded, which means many listeners will find it perfect. It breathes, it flows, it rages, it soothes, it's magnificient. The playing is as fine as can be.The middle movements are also wonderfully shaped and performed, but then comes the finale, when it all falls apart, which is a shame. The first problem to solve in presenting this work is the linking, in weight and breadth of time, of the two main movements, 1 and 4, which are bookends in the complete sense: the work is contained and controlled by them. While they don't need equal weight, they need comparable weight, comparable seriousness and exploration. And here, after that wonderful beginning, Boulez rushes through the last movement, not just failing to answer the questions the first presents, but ignoring their very presence. While his fans may enjoy it, this is not successful Mahler."
5,Book 3 of a 4-Book Mystery Series,"Peggy Sue was murdered, and the mystery still is not solved. It will not be solved until the 4th book.The atmosphere of this book is fun; the murder mystery is intriguing and will keep you reading.The book takes place in a California high school; the characters are complex and well-developed. It is so fun."
5,Amazing,James Carlos Blake is my favorite all-time author ..... and while it can never happen ... I would like to meet him ... buy him coffee (or a drink) and thank him.
1,Never trust Soho Electronics,"Soho Electronics stole me more than [...]$... I've bought a Canon GL2 camcorder and accesories on March of last year and I never recived anything, after a lot of e-mails and false promises... Of course, they charged my credit card... They are liars and never give true information about email addresses to contact them, or never give an answer to the client's Emails... The customer service mail ([...]) doesn't work... The website doesn't allow you to contact them... The last time I phoned them they gave me false information and left me alone waiting a long at the phone... Attention please Amazon, attention please buyers: never trust Soho Electronics."
3,Average...Sorry!,"This one was a bit of a let down, as I had seen this show/tour...good for a collector and worth the watch, but probably won't be on my repetitive watch list."
4,deep purple rocks,this is a great dvd anyone that likes hard rock of the 70to now should like this a good look at one of the better band of our times great concert and interview that makes it clear why richie blackmore is not playing with this band anymore
3,Pass it by,"Sorry folks--I really hate to give this a bad review because if I got anything out of this it was an even greater respect for the other three members of the band (thus 3 stars); Blackmore doesn't contribute any interviews on the DVD. They seem like really great people and it's clear they all still have their chops...well I did have to cringe a little at some of Ians attempts to pull off a few of these tunes. Frankly, Blackmore's playing is really lack luster--it's clear he doesn't want to be there..I've heard better from good local bar-band Guitarists. He's a really talanted guy to be sure--and will certianly give him his due--but the man needs to grow up! Stop the tempermental artist bit. If he didn't want to do the tour he should never have agreed to do in the first place! Rent this if you can find it--otherwise skip it--nothin missed..go listen to Machine Head to get your Purple fix."
5,Total Rock & Roll Ecstasy!,"This is an awesome music DVD full of great music and it is a must-have for any Purple fan. Unlike Austrailia '99 there are hypnotic laser effects and masterfull light engineering throughout. The audio is crisp and loud, without any defects at all and the direction is excellent. Their rendition of 'Paint it Black' is unreal. I replayed it several times. I'd like to rip this to CD so I can hear it on the road."
4,Enjoy this effort,"Don't worry about Blackmore ""pouting"" or be bothered that he enters the stage two minutes into the opening song. Just enjoy this fine effort by the band at a low point in their creative career. The band still kicks major...and Blackmore is in fine form, his playing is not at all sloppy. I don't know where some reviewers get that. Blackmore is Blackmore and some people think he plays sloppy (some people say Jimmy Page plays sloppy, or Hendrix did)but seeing and hearing him is incredible. The fact that he pitches a small fit on stage and soon left the band makes this release all the more special. Buy this with the confidence that if you like DP you'll enjoy this. Sound and picture are very good, and interviews are a nice extra."
4,not what they used to be,"Machine Head was my introduction to rock and I think over the years I listened to it over a thousand times. I don't regret buying this DVD but it is very clear that everyone is old. Ian Gillan's voice is basically gone and Blackmore is disinterested. For some reason they rushed through the track Lazy at 100 mph, and they did not stick to studio.This is not the group it was in the 70's! By the way, if you like Deep Purple have you heard the older ""Come taste the band"" with Tommy Bolin instead of Blackmore ? It is quite nice."
1,Actually Zero Stars!! This shouldn't have been RELEASED!!,"What a disaster this dvd is!! I feel really sorry for Deep Purple on this tour!! First of all Blackmore is so angry that he comes on stage 2 minutes after the Highway Star opener!! He plays totally sloppy, almost, I think, on purpose!! The rest of the band is fuming and try to hold it together. He throws water at the camera, misses notes, and doesn't seem to care!! The rest of the band plays alright, some notes are missed but what would you expect when the guitarist is sabotaging the show!? The interviews are depressing, they go off on Ritchie, rightfully. SKIP THIS ONE!! Try to hunt down the old Rainbow vhs to see some great Blackmore!! This is not how I want to remember Deep Purple. Oh, and I returned it as well!"
4,This could be a very good concert but its worth for 4 star,"Why 4 star? because Mr.Ritchie 'Rainbow in the Dark' (Sung by Dio)have spoil the sup again with the camera man. A good showmanship can play their instrument very well and deep concerntration infront of any camera man but not him...... nowonder their title it:Come Hell Or High Water.Anyway this DVD is still worth for the serious ""Rocker wanna be"" and music lover."
3,Blackmore Bashing,"I have never seen Gillan so happy as in this farewell concert to the Ritchie DP era. Why DP had to ruin this DVD with all the inserts of ""Let's bash Blackmore"" is a testament to DP Gillan management to capitilize on the DP name. It's obvious that this production is soley based on ending Ritchie's career with DP for good by tarnishing the man in black as much as possbile. Give credit to Gillan and DP for making it happen. Thank you Mr. Ian Gillan and Deep Purple for your thoughts on RB and what he has done for/to DP. May the sun keep shining brightly for Gillan's Purple as I bask under the cloudy/stormy skies for sounds of music! Thank you very much."
4,Deep Purple!,"This is a great dvd... I mean, yeah... you can see the tention between Ritchie Blackmore and the rest of the band throughout the whole entire concert, but they still sound amazing. Ritche blackmore throws a cup of water across the stage at one point, and on some songs, he doesen't even come out on stage, until half way thorugh song haha.Very good setlist here. The interviews are pretty interesting to watch.All in all, a good dvd. Good stuff for deep purple fans."
3,Give me a break,"Apparently Mr bcsimmons has never heard the expression ""it is better to be silent and thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt""."
4,4 Star Musicians minus 1...,"This DVD is great despite the fact that Ritchie has an atitude through most of the show. Everyone except Ritchie gives it their all, but even without giving it his all his guitar work is still amazing. Gillan's voice is strong and clear through most of the show, and The band on a whole is very, very tight. I never saw DP live, so I am going to cherish this DVD and watch it often. I recommend this to anyone who likes DP."
3,Great music....poor attitude.,"The music on the DVD is great and all of the members of the band perform excellently but the attitude of Ritchie Blackmore almost ruined it for me. Blackmore, while an excellent guitarist, is a first class jerk (and that's being kind). The water throwing incident and the remark he made, that was told by one of his bandmates, concerning Eric Clapton were uncalled for. Also, all of the other members of the band appeared on camera for interviews but Mr. Blackmore was not to be found, just like when other members (especially Jon Lord) took a solo. Yes the music is great but be advised that you'll be witness as to why Deep Purple has had so many members and has disolved so many times, Ritchie Blackmore and his attitude."
2,SKIP IT - THE SONGS ARE GOOD BUT THE CD MASTERING IS HORRIBLE,"Some of Garcia's greatest hits in one convenientlypackaged CD. The CD was mastered and manufactured in Canada, but sold in the Argentine market. This is in the days before thay had CD plants down there and all CDs had to be imported from Canada, the US, Brazil, Mongolia, Burkina Faso, etc... In short, buy ""Obras Cumbres I & II"" instead of this terribly mastered CD. There's so much tape noise it's unbelievable. And they even desecrated one of my favorite tunes ""Como Mata El Viento Norte"" to the point in which nobody noticed the tape deck's azimuth alignment was completely off when they mastered this record. Spend a couple of more $ and get Obras Cumbres Instead. you won;t regret it."
5,Hilarious!,"A divine and sweet comedy. Has great incites on realtionships, both romantic and familial, a unique point of view. You will never view a penguin the same way again."
4,Fun and entertaining!,"Jim Keeble is so talented that I won't deign to compare him to that other lad-lit writer. Men and Other Mammals tells the story of Scott Barron, a bestselling author and toast of London. His life couldn't be better - that is until his girlfriend leaves him and his third book doesn't reach the same success that his previous efforts had. To make matters worse, he's begun to envy his younger brother's life. Hasn't it always been the other way around? After all, Jes is a struggling writer with an average life. But Jes, unlike Scott, is happily married. Is love the one thing missing in Scott's life? There are some fun twists in the novel.I know critics have put lad-lit writers through the Nick Hornby test. (Oops, I've said it!) But Keeble has wit, insight and self-deprecating humor all his own. I for one look forward to his next effort."
2,Not right for me,"This item is probably made for very very large radios. The velcro straps did allow for adjustment around mine, but it was still too big really. I pretty much had to rig it. (And we have one of the larger radios in law enforcement) The size is not my biggest concern however.The swivel clip on it is so loose and easily turnable, that my radio is constantly falling off of my hip. This is dangerous in my line of work. (corrections) I've also hit my emergency response button since owning this case (1 week) because I am constantly having to readjust it from falling or not fitting right. (Not good to hit that button.)I would say what I was most satisfied with, is the part that clips to the belt itself. It is very secure and you can tighten it enough not to move around.I've used a swivel clip before, and not had this kind of issue. Unfortunately I will have to return it and get something more suitable."
1,unsatisfied customer,"I am, unsatisfied with this server. I did not receive my book. I sent them an email letting them know and they said i should get it by august 4 and when I do i can send it back and get a refund. It is now August 14 and I still havent received my book. Very disappointed, and now I cant get my money back and I had to buy the book from my over priced book store at school"
1,Quality has slipped,I've used a dozen boxes of these photo mount cards and do not like the new design. The pocket for the photograph requires trimming a standard 4x6 print on three sides to get it to fit. This is very different than the former design and time consuming.
3,Serves it's purpose but very plain,"If you are looking for plain, these are plain. I purchased them because I couldn't locate any other design that weren't Christmas photo cards. Thank god I'm a scrapper, I was able to decorate them up with some bling !! Otherwise a good quality card !!"
1,Changed their product,I was re-buying this product after I ran out of my first batch. I used the frames for papercrafting but will not be purchasing them again. The older product allowed you to completely open the window flap by pulling apart two small glued spots but the new product has glued the window frame down completely and it is EXTREMELY hard to work with. It's probably fine if you are stuffing stiff photographs in them but I am printing pictures on my computer and making handmade cards with them with my own designs. My printed pictures are not stiff and do not go easily into their frames without damage. They need to go back to the old style. I also liked to emboss the frame but can not do that anymore unless I emboss the entire front of the card. It just doesn't work anymore. They look horrible. This company doesn't understand their market.
5,Excellent Pictures,"""Total Film"" is a magazine I discovered while waiting at Heathrow airport at six in the morning. Since then, whenever I see it I buy it. The contents of this magazine are incredible! Though the language can be PG-13 or higher sometimes, it shouldn't be too much of an issue. The articles are fun and fast, as the pictures (which are usually actual pictures, and not cheesy snapshots sold to them by tourists). I especially like the occasional ""abridged script"" on the back page. I definately, recommend this magazine to movie and entertainment lovers everywhere!"
1,A joke to anyone who knows anything about cinema.,"This magazine recently (April 05) featured what they felt were the 100 greatest movie moments of all time. Number 1 was the sing-along scene from MAGNOLIA. Other moments in the top 10 included the credits from AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of Eugene Levy's quotes from AMERICAN PIE. Keep in mind, these are the 100 greatest movie moments of ALL TIME.This mag/rag is nothing more than the film section of FHM stretched out to full-issue length. Utter trash."
4,"August Strindberg's ""The Father""","It's a fascinating play, laying bare the relationships, at that time, between the sexes. Chilling in its portrayals. If you're a man and about to get married - don't read this!"
2,How not to write a biography,"Rayfield's life of Chekhov is clotted with junk: railway itineraries, sexual details, and relentless speculation. Read his 600 pages and you will not be the better for it. You never get a sense of Chekhov the writer, or how Chekhov, the son of a failed grocer who beat his family daily, made himself into a man. Sure, other biographers are less frank about the sex -- but who cares, really? I recommend Henri Troyat's biography of Chekhov instead."
5,The magic of books,"The Little Country is all about the magic and music of books, the time periods and places they can take you, and the people to whom they can introduce you. If you enjoy immersing yourself in a story, read this charming tale by DeLint. You will be introduced to a wonderfully vivid cast of characters who are almost too real--you will be hard pressed to tolerate anything bad happening to the heroes and will wonder why they would ever get mixed up with the villains--and taken on a magical journey. Good rainy afternoon reading."
2,"Sad to rate it so low, but ...","Apparently I'm one of only two people to give this book such a low rating, but ... I've tried to read this book twice now. It's lyrically written, and the premise is fascinating. However, each time I've tried to read it, I get a ways in and then find myself closing the book in annoyance. Maybe it's just me, and maybe I've been misreading it, but the split that results between Janey and (I've forgotten his name now) is based, in my mind, on a pretty weak fight. The split is obviously necessary to propel the story forward, but I found the reason for the split to be so juvenile and unbelievable, given these characters' depth and personalities, that, as stated before, I've tried and failed twice to read the book. I am however reading Moonheart and think it's wonderful, and fully plan on reading more of de Lint's books. Perhaps one day I'll be able to finish The Little Country. I hope so, as it showed a lot of promise."
2,Disappointed,"By reading all of the other reviews I thought that this book would be right up my alley, and the actual story line was, but the execution of the story really lacks something. I felt no real connection to the characters, and there was never any suspense to the writing that made me want to read further. It's not that I disliked the book - it's that it didn't stirred my emotions at all. I felt that it was a waste of time."
4,Great,My wife and I heard Secada at Disney World last fall. She loved him and I gave her this disk for Christmas. The music is infectious. I know very little about music but it is clear to even me that Secada has an incredible voice.
5,John Secada has taught buns,"John Secada has the greatest voice. I listen to this CD every day before I go to my flamenco dance class. He really pumps me up for the physical nature of the flamenco dance. This way I can just imagine that I'm dancing with Jon Secada during my class. His songs, and images of his gorgeous body remain with me throughout the day. I love you Jon baby!"
2,Good Voice weak material,I respect Jon Secada.he has a alright voice.but most of his music is downright Boring&dull.i would like to hear him challenge himself with things more soulful.
4,only for little kids!!!,"i'm a swim instructor and i thought it would be good enough for kids about 8 to 10 years of age, but it turns out this kickboard is ONLY for really little kids, i.e. 3 to 6.it wont support bigger kids who are above 3 and a half feet tall. and if ur 5 year old is fat, dont get this board either.i use it to improve my breaststroke kick though b/c it barely supports me, i have to kick harder for more support. i guess it can be used to improve all ur kicks (flutter, fly, BR) if ur really into swimming."
4,Nice sled,"Received in flimsy packaging that was damaged, but the sled was intact. It is a fun sled for the kids."
1,Don't bother,"If you love feminist philosophy, and you don't mind all the impractical ideas and flawed logic, then this is your book. I cannot stand these things, so I found this book to be a waste of trees."
5,NEW LEADERS OF MUSICA NORTEN~A,"I THINK THIS CD IS INTOCABLE AT HIS BEST I PERSONALLLY LIKE ""COSTUMBRE"", ""SON~ADOR ETERNO"", ""HOY DUELE"", ""FUERTE NO SOY"",""TE QUIERO"" BUT THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE BEST BUT ITS ALL GOOD. THATS WHY I GIVE IT 5 STARS."
4,The untouchables do it again!!!!!!,"I liked 8 of the 13 songs on this cd. It had a softer feel than previous efforts. The first song is obviously the hit single but i liked ""Desengano"" more than the rest of the others. Intocable, more than any other band, has revolutionized the tejano sound. Their eclectic blend of music has given fans, young and old, a reason to listen. For now, they are at the top of their game! Rockin!"
3,No instructions for using a rice cooker :-(,"Beautifully put together book, but my main complaint is that there are no instructions for using a rice cooker. The authors talk about how they used one for a year and were quite happy with this technique, but preferred using the saucepan method. That's all well and good, but some of us don't have the time or patience for that."
5,Excellent recipes!,"My husband is the one who uses this book, but I happen to be a very picky foodie and I have to say, I benefit from the food he has made from the recipes of this book. We (or he) will try more recipes and we will see if the rest are as good."
2,Great if you own a pantry full of worldwide exotic ingredients and love the history of another part of the world.,"The cover states ""rice"" but once you start to read --- only about a quarter of the book covers actual rice recipes.Otherwise.... Most pages call for using exotic ingredients that are difficult to find in the largest of grocery chains in the U.S. unless you happen to live in - or near an all Asian neighborhood. Thailand....China....India...Calcutta....Persia.... Very hot chilies are not only used in Mexico. Many of those applied in this part of the world can ""cook"" your throat.Added and much appreciated herein are the lovely, lengthy stories that accompany the histories of condiments/recipes and peoples we'd otherwise have never known. In many ways this book is n eye opener in the quest to amplify one's knowledge of cuisine and - as well - quotidian life in other parts of the world."
5,"A compilation of twenty-four lengthy, critical essays","Mickey R. Dansby, James B. Stewart, and Schuyler C. Webb effectively collaborate to edit Managing Diversity In The Military: Research Perspectives From The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, a compilation of twenty-four lengthy, critical essays of a subject that inevitably arouses heated debate: issues of diversity in the United States military, and how to best resolve often widely conflicting opinions. Managing Diversity In The Military is divided into five main sections, which address issues from diversifying military leadership to gender integration/sexual harassment to race and military discipline. A scholarly, academic examination of a highly complicated subject fraught with human complexities, Managing Diversity In The Military is essential reading for anyone directly affected by or interested in this key managerial issue affecting the readiness and performance capabilities of the United States armed forces today."
2,Below Average,"Order was received on time and in the condition desribed by the seller. However, the material was less than what was expected. Not real discussion on the tough issues of diversity. The book focused more on policy but nothing on next steps!"
1,NOT heavyweight,"I bought this liner after reading the reviews, and wish I hadn't. Wasted my money as this is not a heavy liner, and billowed in around me when I showered. The suction cups on the sides are nice, but it needs weights/magnets at the bottom as well to keep it in place. Very disappointed....looking for a new one, again."
5,No more water on the floor!,"No matter how I try, certain shower curtains allow water to escape the tub and end up on the floor. This product, the Watergard Shower Curtain Liner-Frosty (it can be used without a shower curtain too) solves that problem with integral suction cups that hold the curtain far enough into the shower so that the water goes where it should, down the drain. It's a successful solution to an aggravating problem."
5,Good Product,This is the only shower curtain I'll buy. It stays free of mildew and it's easy to clean. The reinforced eyelets help the curtain last a long time. The only issue I have with the curtain is that it has a strong plastic odor for the first week or so. I suggest hanging outside for a few days if possible.
2,Amateur League,"Trust me, you already know these ""great"" secrets! This is geared toward women who have no self-confidence, and also no sense of adventure. I am NOT an expierenced woman, but any woman with a bit of logic would know these secrets; dressing sexy, teasing, being confident in bed. There is nothing new to learn here."
1,NOT THE COMPLETE MOVIE!!,"Be forewarned-this is NOT the complete 4 part movie produced by showtime. This is only the first 2 episodes. If you want the complete story, look for ""Bonanno: A Godfathers Story, The Complete Series"" which is currently around 65 bucks, otherwise you're just getting half the movie. It strikes me that one of the producers is listed as 'Bill Bonnano'. So is this just a way to rip off the public and get them to buy the same movie twice in order to rake in more royalties? Think about it...who sells half a movie? Gee, I hope I don't get whacked for exposing this fraud!!"
1,doesn't seem complete,"I remember it being longer, until I saw that it's not ""Bonanno: A Godfather's Story"". Regret spending even 10 cents on it."
4,"Good action, dramatic, but a bit of a whitewash","My only problem with this TV miniseries is that it makes the gangster Joe Bonanno look like a hero. Well, he may have been fairly clean compared to most of the other Mafia chiefs, but he was still a gangster.It is still an enjoyable series, and it contains some interesting perspective on the role Lucky Luciano played in helping the Allies invade Sicily."
3,Good movie and good telling... But...,This is a good movie and has a good story... But it looks like mr bonanno was trying to make him selvf look like a mr nice guy and that the other mob familys are only thinking of money and power. But again... A good movie:)
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this movie because I read all of the postitve reviews. I love Mafia movies and I own a lot of them. This is the ONLY mafia movie that I have watched and did NOT like. I was very uninteresting, very boring, and I will never watch it again."
3,Works.,"Works, but have to be sure to tighten the blender really tight so it does not leak when using it."
3,Worked fine,I have a fifty year old Oster blender and the gasket finally wore out. I found these gaskets on Amazon and wondered if they would work with my old blender. It's gasket was shaped a little differently. I was very pleased to find the gasket worked fine with my blender. No more leaks!
5,blender gasket,I bought an Oster blender [from Amazon] several years ago. I recently noticed it was dripping thru the blending mechanism at the bottom - I replaced the gaskets with these. The dripping was reduced but not eliminated so I also replaced the blending blades...with the new gasket and cutting blades mechanism the dripping stopped. very pleased.
3,Why do these guys all drive Jeeps?,"Krentz is getting a little laid back about her formula here. Even though the premise of a ""glass museum"" and the ""Hades Cup"" were interesting, I think that there were just too many nefarious goings-on in the art world for this story to be believable. Krentz seems to have left out the secondary characters which usually make her novels so much more interesting. It was very much an average read. Not very bad, but then again not all that very good. One would do better to go back and read earlier novels by Krentz."
3,Kept my interest.,"Enjoyable ""escapist"" reading. I thought the interplay between the protaganists was amusing. I hope the editor/publisher/author reads these comments occasionally: do you KNOW how many times the word ""discreet"" was spelled incorrectly?! There IS a word ""discrete"" but not with the meaning intended by the author! Use a spell-check program if you must but have someone who is reasonably literate read through the final version before publication, please! (Sorry about the diatribe, but I find errors like that very distracting while I am reading). That said, I did find the novel entertaining and will look for other books by the same author in future."
4,Sharp Edges,"For the first quarter of the book, I thought Eugenia was (to be polite) a witch. She slowly became likeable. All of poor Cyrus's choices in clothing were so tacky. The story had a good blend of romance and mystery. After reading this book and all the talk of glass, I have a serious interest in collecting glass art."
2,Not Krentz's best,"I normally love Jayne Ann Krentz's novels. I love her spunky, intelligent and funny heroines and unique males. However, I did not enjoy this novel. I agree with one of the previous reveiwers, I didn't like Eugenia. There is a point of being independent, then there is just plain old-fashioned snobbery. She constantly looked down on people/places in the town as well as Cyrus.I am giving it two stars for the suspense section as that was well written, but I don't recommend this novel as a great starting point for Jayne Ann Krentz readers. I would start with Absolutely, Positively, Family Man, Trust Me or Grand Passion."
4,"Good, but still missing something","I was excited about this book, because the beginning of it (published behind Deep Waters) seems to be a return to JAK's (and AQ's) normal style, which I think is great. (I do vastly prefer the Quick stories). But I was sad to discover that although this is a pretty good book, it still seems that you are watching the story through a dark, cloudly glass. Her earlier stories made you feel right in the thick of things. I don't care about the ""formula"" angle of these plots, the formula works great for me. I do want to care more about the characters, however. Ms. Krentz is still about the best Romance writer around. The sad part is that she could be (and has been) so much better! Please slow down. I would pay double for book I wanted to read many times over. None of the recent ones have qualified."
3,Sharp Plot,"I liked this plot. I think JAK even managed to surprise w/who was the bad guy in the end. It had some good twists and turns. The male/female leads were typical, but I like that. I don't want her to change up how she writes her leads. This was published in 1998. It's a good read."
5,You'll love it!,This CD-ROM is a great companion to the book. It reads the book and puts the story into song/rap. It features a read-aloud by Ray Charles. It also has other games that help kids with alphabet recognition. I am a kindergarten teacher and have used this in my classroom with much success. It is very user-friendly for little ones and they absolutely love it!
5,Gebbie Press,"Media contact information goes out of date so rapidly that even last year's edition of this directory may not suffice. Perhaps this edition may be of some value to someone researching media outlets that existed in the past, but I suggest that if you want current media contact details, you need the latest edition.Gebbie Press All-In-One Directory 2010"
5,I laughed out loud.,This was a fun read. Lewis cleverly makes his point. I seldom laugh out loud while reading. However I did with this book.
3,It covers pretty well software security theory,"It is a good book but with the exception of the chapter on buffer overflows, my perception of the book is that it focus mainly on the theory of software security. As someone who has an engineer formation, I have a preference for books more pratical with more concrete examples. For this reason, I did preferHunting Security Bugs"
2,Deeply disappointing. Keep on looking.,"For such an expensive and highly promoted book this is abig disappoinment. If you really want to know how to buildsecure software do not look here. You would do better tosubscribe to one of the security mailing lists and readdocuments available on the Web. The book covers only avery narrow range of topics. There is very little in herefor Web apps - securing Web servers, for example. I have athick tutorial from a consultant on my desk here whichleaves this book for dead - at least for Web security.Strangely the book criticises SSH and S/Key and I thinkthose criticisms were weak when so many more relevantissues could have been discussed. The book discusses bufferoverflows but the discussion is inferior to the referencedonline paper ""Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit"" by""mudge"". I could go on and on. There just is not enoughmeat in the book to make it a worthwhile read."
3,Highly recommended,"Accurate, to-the-point, and proper coverage of main topics. Good job on part of authors.Unfortunately, the book's accompanying website (www.buildingsecuresoftware.com/) at the time of this writing is not responding."
1,Not what I expected,"The book has an interesting premise. The parts of the book sometimes work, mostly don't, and in the end add up to very little. I found many errors, and felt the authors could have spent more time explaining web related topics then were covered. All in all, a big disappointment."
1,not what I expected,"very basic. all fluff. While I understand this is a guide for people just getting into coaching, it is still very basic. After reading the manual I feel I got nothing out of it. There are far better books available at a fraction of the cost."
4,Very good!,"I received the book last week. Though withdrawn from a library, it is in a good condition. I'll enjoy reading it. Thank you very much."
2,Buy this AFTER you get your license,"If you have no previous exposure to Ham radio, then this isn't the book for you. There isn't any big picture introductory material -- page 1 starts with guidance for purchasing your ham radio rig (back in 1998). The ARRL technician class study guide has better intro material.The author does a good job of defining terms, but many terms which need defining are missed (or not defined soon enough). For example, 'DXing' is mentioned 15 times before it is defined on page 24. The density of new terms is challenging -- even if they were all defined the first time they were used.Instead, this should be the first book you buy after receiving your technician class license. It is full of information and advice, but you simply can't start from zero with this book."
3,OK Starter,"I found the book was ok as an introduction to the area, but insufficient to prepare for a licensing exam."
5,"Odd name, Great book","I had this book for years and always got a laugh out of it. It highlights actual laws still on the books (as of date of print back in the 70's, but still humorous!) across the country. I can't recommend this book enough if you need a good laugh. If you have this book or are lucky enough to find one, hold onto it. My copy was stolen!"
5,Relaxing yet dynamic..,"I realize [now] that Anugama has been out there for many years. However, as a 60's R&B, Rockn, Rock,folk,jazz,clasical afficienado, I was unaware that there was authentically performed, composed, and enjoyable ""New Age' music out there. This is it. If money were no object, I'd buy all the Anugama CDs. But I think this one is the best, though I only sampled the other CD's on-line. Not just white noise, I had friends in their late 20's, 30's actually ask me what was playing when I had it in my main stereo during a party,not just the sleepy bedroom mimi-stereo. They could dig it. It's multifaceted music. Roger"
1,A Nice marketing tools for lawyers,"This book is nothing but a marketing ploy for a sub-par attorney. Save your money, and go to Nolo press (or some other entity) that is not trying to sell you something. A waste of time."
1,Poor sales pitch,I read this book and wish I could meet the author and ask her if she thinks all senior citizens are stupid. The books talks down to seniors and is a thinly disguised sales brochure for the author's sub-par living trusts.I wish she was more honest in the book; she obviously have never stepped foot inside a court before. All she has done is take advantage of seniors unable to see her for what she is; a trust peddler. This book is a sad tomb of lies and half truths. Better books exist from authors who actually practice law in courts.
1,Written by the ignorant for the ignorant,"This book is written by an attorney who knows very little about the practice of law. The information presented in the book is largely inaccurate, painfully written by someone who is obviously trying to sell the readers on her own expertise so they will use her legal services. I checked the California State Bar, and the author, a self described 'trust expert' is not even a certified specialist by the bar. Better books exist on this subject, written by real experts, not a clearly under qualified trust mill practitioner."
5,Suite Espanola - Aalbeniz,"This product is an excellent Kalmus production (K 03002) with a thick cover and highly acute print. Of course, the entire set of 8 beautiful Spanish piano pieces are presented with sufficient annotations (no fingering) to give you the flavor:Suite Espanolaa. Granadab. Catalunac. Sevillad. Cadize. Asturiasf. Aragong. Castillah. CubaI think it is understood that no score could be notated enough to allow the pianist to interpret exactly the Albeniz Spanish flavor but I believe there are sufficient notations; the Spanish feel has to come from listening and feeling this music and I would recommend playing the CD by Guillermo Gonzalez - http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000I7RS/ref=pe_58730_26560540_pe_vfe_dp2.I hope this helps you purchase this book."
1,Surprisingly yucky,"I bought these because we love Mrs. May's Almond Crunch, which we've bought at Costco. We like walnuts, too, and thought this snack would be just as good as the almond crunch. Unfortunately it's not. The skin on the walnuts makes the walnut crunch taste bitter and there's a strange kind of health-foody malty taste, too. We kept opening bags thinking the next one would be better, but they were all the same. Buy the almond crunch instead, that's really good."
1,Taste like sawdust,Not that I've ever eaten sawdust. But this just might be a good comparison. Very dry and no taste. I'm surprised this one ever got off the ground with Mrs. Mays.
1,THIS STUFF IS MADE IN CHINA,I WOULD NOT FEED THIS SNACK FOOD TO KIDS. IT IS A PRODUCT OF CHINA AND GOD KNOWS WHAT IS IN IT.
2,Buy Tom Tom,"Last year we traveled to France and rented a Tom Tom navigation system with our rental car. It worked great. This year we bought a Garmin Unit ($100) and a Europe insert ($100). It often mislead us, taking us off main routes to wander the countryside on narrow roads. A Tom Tom unit that covers North America and Europe is $160. I do not know how Tom Tom does in the US but it is much better in Europe. Our Taxi driver in Rome used a Tom Tom."
3,Out of Date upon Arrival,"If you have the time to to wait two hours to unlock the disk, load onto your computer, then load onto the unit, this this is the product for you. However, you will be wasting your time and money if you want the latest maps because this is an out-of-date product. After spending a hour with the Garmin rep, I was assured that I had the latest disk, because they only produce it once a year. The maps, however, are updated quarterly so this 2009 disk does not contain the latest 2009.1 map update. If you want to spend another $129, you can get a one time update for the map.Now that I have vented, I have to say I love the product, but Garmin needs a new business model."
5,What's the fuss?,"After reading some of the negative reviews here, I was a little nervous about buying this software upgrade, but went ahead and bought anyway.Installing the Europe maps to my device went off without a hitch, and it's pretty intuitive. So . . . I am having trouble seeing what the fuss is about. Unlocking the map(s) was easy and installing the software to my C:/ drive was a snap. You have the option of installing maps for just the areas you plan to visit or for Europe as a whole -- just be aware that all of Europe takes up 203 separate maps. And that was the most tedious part -- clicking on 203 separate maps.Once that's done, however, just click ""upload to device"" and stand back! A word to the wise -- I chose the ""all Europe"" option, and mine took 2-1/2 hours to upload.Highly recommended, and better than renting a GPS from the car rental agency once you get there."
4,upgrade Garmin for use in Europe,"Was very hard to install, had to call Garmin. But, once installed, it worked well."
1,Not useful for driving,"I bought the maps to help me navigate around Sicily. The product was less than helpful in doing that. I would summarize the issues as follows:* Poor recognition of input names. For example you must spell out long names for towns and streets. Any misspelling or deletion of an ""article"" for a name will cause the system to fail to find the location. There is none of the intelligence you get from systems like google maps.* Direction are often the most difficult way to get someplace. Several times I was sent down very narrow, barely passable streets only to find there was a major road that went to the same place. At least three times I was sent down the wrong direction on a one way street.* The system gives you street names as the primary indicator, even though street names in towns are rarely marked at each intersection.* Pronunciation of Italian names is unintelligible.So buying this product is a waste of money Its very disappointing that Garmin can not do better."
2,"Tried it, difficult to install ""correctly"".","After a recent trip to western Europe we returned home with smiles and snears.The three countries that had been installed by me on the Garmin 1300 were in places I didn't plan on visiting.I believe they were the ""latest"" entries to the total grouping. After my attempted installation I tried to test the potential of the new information prior to the journey's onset. I could not. Indoors OR out of doors.It shouldn't take a ""techie"" to install workable contents of the Garmin City Navigator Europe NT. What appears to have been simple---should have been..."
3,Inadequate installation instructions,"While the process of installation was simple enough, getting the application to actually work on a Nuvi with US maps already installed has so far proved impossible. The instructions provided are entirely inadequate."
1,Garmin worst ever,europe NT - three of us tried multiple download tries. No luck. Garmin phone help could not resolve said send it in. we did and they exchanged the new garmin we purchased thru Amazon for a refurbished Garmin. Still no help. tried three other computers. No resolve. Tried the Amazon review help reviews. What a bust. Sendig it all back.[[ASIN:B003ZX8B2S Garmin nüvi 1450LMT 5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Map & Traffic Updates
3,Depends on what you want.,"I used these maps in Poland and never got lost, however, with these maps the GPS finds quite convoluted ways to get to places. I didn't mind because that way, I saw much more of the country. But if that's not what you want, it will be quite annoying. One problem, I suspect, is that there isn't much data on what's a primary road and what's a secondary road. Also, there's no traffic information, so my guess is that shortest time is calculated purely using distance because that's all the information that's available. It does appear that the maps become less detailed the further east you go, so these maps may be much better for western Europe."
2,difficult to install,"The CN Europe NT maps for Europe are a surprisingly difficult installation. The documentation is confusing and poorly written. The process requires that you find and enter a number of codes (product code, serial number, unlock code, unit code, etc.) without suggesting where you might find them or what they might look like. All this is required so that you can then struggle with unfamiliar software for uploading sections of maps.I expected this to be like the relatively hassle-free North American map update. That one is straightforward and uploads the entire NA map in one action. Of course, until I get to Europe, there is no way to tell if I have uploaded the maps I need and whether the auto-routing feature will work.This is not an Amazon problem, it is Garmin's ""not user friendly"" design that is at fault."
2,Bring a translator with you!,"I've very used to using a Garmin Nuvi and find them very helpful in the US. We bought this map for use in ITALY. However, while this DVD provided capable routing directions, we could not understand the spoken directions -- not because they were in Italian; but because the spoken pronunciation didn't sound anything like the Italian version! As a result, when you were trying to confirm a highway or street name for a turn, you had to tap the screen each time to get the written street name. This is a BIG problem in Italy where drivers are crazy. Our view is Garmin needs to change their voice algorithms for Italian words to more closely resemble spoken Italian. We eventually only used this as a backup and navigated by map -- which we luckily brought with us for the trip."
1,High Fiber High Flavor,"I was extrememly dissapointed with this book. As a dietitian I expected a book entitled high fiber to have high fiber recipes in it. Some of the recipes look excellent but they are far from high fiber. I also expected that each recipe would, at least, tell me how many grams of fiber I was eating. If you purchase this book expect to get a lot of good recipes that use minimal amounts of grains and beans. This is a definite leave on the shelf book if you are trying to include more fiber in your diet. Unless, that is, you are prepared to change all of her recipes by increasing the amount of beans and grains used."
1,Some Information Please,"For a book that is featured as healthy, high fiber eating it is practically worthless. Any cookbook marketed under the banner of good health MUST have the nutrition facts included. There is absolutely no way to determine the amount of fiber of any recipe.Big disappointment."
1,And another thing...,"In some ways the author gives a better picture of Tolkien's England than Humphrey Carpenter; possibly because the latter is so much a creature of the same universe (born and brought up in Oxford) that he doesn't realise how different it is to some people.But the author's errors aren't confined to Middle Earth:Bournemouth isn't (and never has been) in Devon, you can't go 'along' the Carfax, Christopher Tolkien was a don at New College, not University College. Oxford doesn't have four teaching terms a year, the colleges don't award degrees, Exeter College isn't adjacent to Balliol...He doesn't even know that the pound sign precedes the amount. He has apparently looked at a map of Oxford, but never been there. Indeed, the book reads as though he had never been to Britain.I agree with the other reviewers: save your money."
1,Grotta should have read Tolkien on Tolkien.,"I must say that as a college student I would like to have my 15 dollars returned to me from the purchase of this book. Although there are some interesting ""facts"" in this book, it is largely not credible. I believe Grotta used questionable resources in compiling this biography which Tolkien himself refutes in many of his letters. i.e. Grotta writes of Tolkien's garage work shop on Sandfield Rd., which in ""The Letters of..."" Tolkien himself states that he ""...had never written any literary matter in it..."" and that the room was only used by his secretary. Grotta was clearly perturbed at his lack of ""access"" and seemed to want to portray one of the most prolific writers in history as a ""lazy"" individual. Obviously Grotta has never balanced a teaching post at Oxford, an ill wife, several children, along with creating one of the most fully imagined ""secondary worlds"" ever created. Hats of to all things Middle Earth and Grotta back to the drawing board."
1,A nominal effort by someone with an axe to grind.,"This book left me with two impressions. The first impression is that the author did not really have anything new to contribute to an understanding of the life of Tolkien, instead relying on humorous anecdotes, rehashing of Tolkien's relationship with CS Lewis, and materials found elsewhere. The second impression is that the author bears a serious grudge against the Tolkien family for not permitting the access to family papers that was accorded to the authorized biographer, Humphrey Carpenter. This grudge is manifested in snide asides about Tolkien's literary executors. Finally, I must criticize the author for his excursus into the politics surrounding the Nigerian civil war. What this has to do with Tolkien is unclear at best.Money is far better spent on Humphrey Carpenter's biography, and his edition of letters (especially the letters). It is in the letters where the spirit and genius of Tolkien best comes through."
2,One thing I have to add...,"I agree with what has been said already in most of these reviews, but felt compelled to add that while Grotta got a lot of information concering LOTR wrong, and while he obviously did bear a grudge against Christopher Tolkien and the Tolkien estate, he did manage to give a rather acceptible cursory introduction to Tolkien, and the amount of time spent discussing the legal battle between Ace and Houghton Mifflin was enlightening, if not slanted. I'd suggest that if you're looking for an introductory biography that you don't intend to take as gospel and wish to read quickly, this is for you. Otherwise, keep your money and read Carpenter's."
2,poorly edited,"The book is quite poorly edited. It includes footnote symbols without corresponding footnotes. It has numerous mis-spellings and some instances of poor grammar. It also includes many, many instances where citations of the sources of information are needed and not given. Overall, it gives the impression of being ""half-baked."" Quite a poor book, particularly from a journalist.Perhaps, though, the most telling observation may be that it is hopelessly out-of-date. The more recent works regarding the writing of the LOTR make this early attempt quite trivial, incomplete, and not authoritative.I bought an old, battered paperback copy for several dollars at a used bookstore, and, for the (unintended) amusement value alone, I don't feel cheated."
1,"IS THERE A ""O"" RATING??","I found EXACTLY the same as the previous buyer above, only I run dual monitors on two different computers, that means I purchased four (4) of these totally unreliable things, and after 14 months of use I have only one (1) remaining (and it will probably go out any day now)!! That means I sunk well over a thousand dollars for these three monitors and they've completely gone out, and it was too much to box up and send back for repairs for $250 + shipping each to manufacturer, only to have them go out again soon I'm sure.I WILL NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER, BUY SCEPTRE BRAND MONITORS EVER AGAIN!!I don't mean to be harsh, but I sure feel this brand has been harsh on me, sorry folks."
4,A Good Introduction to Opera,"For those persons looking for an introduction to Opera this compilation is an excellent beginning. The recording quality is pretty good overall, and the performances are both interesting and satisfying.I keep listening to these CD's, and they always sound fresh and fun.After listening to this album I find myself wanting to learn more about Opera."
3,"Good, but not universally applicable","Some of the material is very good, although the newer blood type concept perhaps renders this book more useful for people who are type O blood. I myself am type O and find the information very helpful. My type A girlfriend took on elook and said she knew it would never work for her."
5,a life-changing read,"This is the most amazing nutrition book I've ever read- and I've read many. The amount of data, the photographs, the anecdotes, all point to an obvious conclusion. I am simply shocked that his work is not better known. After reading this book I understand why the health of so many in the world today is so poor. This book provides all the answers. I know with absolute certainty now what constitutes a healthy diet. This book will fascinate you, educate you, and leave you feeling shocked. HIGHLY recommended!"
1,FIRST FEIST RUINS THE LEGEND OF THE BLACK SORCER...NOW THIS!,PUG SHOULD DUMP MIRANDA AND GET A WOMAN WHO'S VIRTUE ISN'T SO TARNISHED..AND WHO THE HELL IS SIDI?
1,ONE WHOPPING RIF OFF...ALL FOR DA LUV OF MONEY!,"Can someone tell me the purpose of having a God's dream as the main protagonist? Let alone one that can't be beat?! Feist, you sell out!"
2,The Weakest Book of the Series.,"This conclusion to the series was a big big disappointment for me. The plot was ""tired"", the Characters lacklustre and the villians were weak or non-existent. I think a better conclusion in Rage of a Demon King and let the series end there would have been better. I read this book hoping to be gripped by the usual twists and turns in the plot which is the hallmark of this great and talented author. What did we get? Not a lot. Nakor has great potential for a spin off series. he is a mysterious character and his life prior to his appearance in the Riftwar saga would I'm sure be of great interest to readers. If you compare this novel to the heavy weight ""Empire"" series which you just could'nt put down then it was very lightweight indeed. I do hope The author has'nt ""lost it"" because he can tell a riviting good yarn and of all the Fantasy writers I consider him to be one of the most talented."
2,this book is far below what i've come to expect from feist,while it was definately a good solidly written fantasy novel the quality of this book is lacking
4,Could be improved,"The story plot has far extended itself with too many characters that leaves many with a superficial role. Take Jimmy and Dashel, surely there must be some compelling events to shape them to take on such diverging characters later on. The premature death of William and Arutha would be sorely missed. I just hope that Feist would stick to a manageable number of characters and develop them. Just in Magician, the character Kulgan was so well developed that his shadow still lingers in Pug's character in the later books."
4,This Book Rates An 8 The Serpent War a Perfect 10,"Hard Core Feist readers are probably annoyed by the gaps in SOABC, but it is an annoyance of interest. If Feist wasn't one of the most entertaining authors around, no one would be worried about not seeing the whole picture. I'm sure all lingering questions will be answered in Feist's next book. Plus it's those doubts and annoyances that add to the entertainment. I eagerly await the newest release.Rift War... Serpent War... Shadow War...?"
3,Editors Needed,"To all those people in previous posts complaining about the editing: Word. I'm an editor by profession, and I've found that all of the books in the Serpentwar Saga have numerous typos, grammatical errors, poor phrasing, and inconsistencies with past books. Whoever proofread and/or copyedited this book should be fired, pronto."
1,Get rid of Pug and Thomas,Great story as usual from this author but completely ruined by ending. Heroic people do heroic things then poof! Pug just tells everyone to go home. You get the impression that Feist had written as many words as needed to fulfil committment to publisher. The problem with creating supermen is that the acts of the people around them are meaningless. Very few authors can make superman anything but a comic book and Feist is no exception.
2,"Engaging story, very poor editing","While the story was enjoyable, I had a real problem with the editing (or lack thereof). Not only were there a lot of typos throughout, (""then"" instead of ""than"", ""this women"" instead of ""this woman"", etc.) Feist couldn't keep the characters straight. The brothers Jimmy and Dash had a surname ""Jameson"" in the previous books *AND* in the cast of characters in the front of this book. Then throughout this book the name was changed to ""Jamison"". In a scene late in the book, Jimmy was rushing back to Krondor to help hold against Kesh, but all of a sudden, it became Dash who was attacking the Keshian supply train. Dash was in the city!!! Also, Feist referred to Manfred (Erik von Darkmoor's half brother) as the one who raped Rosalyn and got her pregnant, but it was actually Stephan who did that!!! Feist needs to get better editors in the future."
1,Why ?,"...how do I feel after reading this book, pretty miserable, 'bout the same as the state of the characters and kingdom we have come to love.... I feel David Brin owes us another book to tidy up the horrible mess he has left everything in, and someone pleeeeease give the book a better cover !"
4,I agree with Aaron from Sydney,"After developing such a high expectation from Feist, I must admit to finding his magic not being wove to the artistic endevour that he wove in earlier books. I think there seems to be too many characters and having to develop their characters too quicky, and from this a lack of identification with them. I find that this doesn't allow me to feel what the characters are feeling to the same level, and lowers the overall experience that Feist so ably offers. Nice story, needs that more of that Feist magic to be wove into it though."
4,"pretty good, but not as good as it should be","although quite a good book if you are a feist reader, i must say that even fans must be slightly disappointed after reading this book. unlike the riftwar series, the serpentwar saga and this book do not contain much of any serious character development.while eric and roo were good headliners for the previous books, even they were only marginally interesting compared to pug, prince arutha, and jimmy the hand in the first series. feist did not make the newer characters in the serpentwar saga have enough of a personal life to draw more of my interest.feist's books are now following the trend of movies: lots of noise and fast action. sure, i was hard pressed to put shards.. down, but when i was done, i felt deflated. it did not linger in my mind like many of feist's earlier works.in short, read it at the bookstore or buy the paperback when it comes out. it'll be a fast 6-7 hours."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Cleanup opportunities.After going through a war with a demon, much of Midkemia has serious rebuilding to do. So, great time for an invasion an enterprising Keshian military leader things.So, with the focus off epic fantasy and magic on the same scale as before we have something a little more similar to the previous novel with Borric and Erland, where a couple of the younger generation are the focus of the novel, and have to grow up fast to deal with a serious situation."
4,Another great succes,"Again I think Feist has written a great book. Though i feel he shouldn't always concentrate on the same time period. On the other hand he comes up with new ideas, for which he receives praise. All in all a great book, that also convinced me to buy his other books."
2,Nothing new here. Seemed like a filler.,"I will admit that the three books of the Riftwar saga, are some of the most original and imaginative works out there today. The subsequent books, however, failed to live up to my expectations. ""Shards of a Broken Crown"" basically destroyed my interest in Feist's novels. It was, in a word, boring. The continual cleaning out of present characters to create room for new ones drove me insane all throughout the series especially because many of the new characters were boring and the good ones had very few parts in the story. There were no really evil characters. Some of the plot turns made me throw the book down in disgust. Is there no good that can happen to the characters? Does every one have to die or get totally screwed over? I can only handle so much dispair in a boring book."
2,Feist fumbles the end of a terrific series.,"Having been an avid reader of Feist for many years, I snatched up the last book of The Serpentwar Saga with fervor. Unfortunately, what started out as a wonderful series ended with a flop. The editing was so bad, the book read as if the author was tired of the series and just ready to finish it. The characters of Jimmy and Dash were not well fleshed out, and the battles were won too easily. Eric and Roo, the series' main characters, are not given much time, and Feist succeeds in killing off many of my favorite bit players. I loved the first book of the series, and wished that he had kept the same tone throughout. But Shards of a Broken Crown just does not measure up to the rest of Feist's books. I'm hoping that his next book is a step up."
4,Shards of a Broken Crown,"Another well-written work of fantasy fiction by the author, which concludes the Serpent war saga. I look forward to the next adventures in Midkemia."
4,A good conclusion to the series,I thought this book was a very good conclusion to the Serpentwar series. For once you get to see the Kingdom on the offensive. You also get to see some of the overlooked parts of your average story. I like this book because it dares to be different.
2,Very hard going,"The endless descriptions of minor battle after minor battle that dominated much of this book left me nodding off. The book finally came along as Tomas, Pug, Miranda and others finally tackled the creatures of the nameless one but all too late. Feist is a limited writer at best, unfortunately this is definatley not one of his best works."
5,"Again, we want MORE","Just finished it. Loved it, but now I want to know what happens next to Dash, not to mention Jimmy. It would also be nice to know about... well we will just have to wait."
3,This the saga has ended just in time,"The last book of the Serpent war is maybe not the best, but it is a satisfactory ending to the story, albeit a bit off balance if you compare it to the to-the-pointness of the earlier three. Feist should not have steered the plot into deeper and deeper evil to be vanquished, and the part of the battle with the final evil is downright poorly written. The unimpressed way the heroes deal with that cannot bring up any suspense at all.Not that I think he will read it, but still a word of advice to Mr Feist: beware of the automatic pilot! Either end the story, or open up new threads that are worth developing, but don't introduce subplots that only last for 30 or so pages just to throw in yet another demon. not in a 2000 page saga anyway."
1,THIS BOOK IS THE WORST IDEA SINCE FEIST KILLED OFF VALHERU,INVINCIBLE GOD-DREAM VILLAINS...OMFG! I JUST GIVE UP
1,"HMM, MIRANDA SLEEPS WITH PUG...THEN CALIS..THEN PUG","Hmm,Pug should use whatever means he has to check himself for any STDs. I have feeling Miranda's been around the block a couple of time. But it won't matter to me, cause I'm done with total BS like this book."
2,"Sorry, I hate to do this....",But I can't say this was a good book. After all the good lit and the first two books of this series - AND THE ENDING SUCKED!!! I'm going along going - how will this ever end in this many pages and then....(*blah*) I'm not going to read the Betrayal book - he has turned me off - and I've read all his works.
1,A Big Yawn.,"I was almost as bored reading the end of this series as Mr. Feist appears to have been writing it. It is time for something new Ray, let Pug & friends find their rest now."
3,A weak book compared to its predecessors,"I was very disappointed after reading this book. Pug seemed such a weakling when compared to Miranda and Nakor that even Patrick decided to have a go at the most powerful mortal in the Universe. Even with Macros's vast library at his disposal, he was looking towards Miranda to teach him a simple teleportation trick. When he fell in Elvandar, he had to walk while in the previous book he flew towards the Emrald Queen's ship. Mr. Feist I guess forgot about Pug's powers or else has really underestimated him. Personally my image of Pug was really shattered and I hope the next book will do something to amend that. Owen Greylock's and Arutha's death was also premature and really left a bitter after taste because they were uncalled for."
3,notably inadequate,"I have been quite a fan of Feist in all of his writings. I am sorry to say that this is by far the least cognitive of his books. He started this series off very well with two books that had me begging for more. I am afraid that I should not have begged becuase I feel that Feist may have written the last two books just to end the series. This book especially went nowhwere and accomplished nothing. I am glad that I did not purchase it for my personal library as I would have been sorely upset. Other friends of mine agree that this book was very transparent and had none of the life that normal Feist books entail. I am sorry that I had to write this, but I felt that all of the other reviews were gifts by ardent fans. I enjoy good books and do not read an author solely for the name on the cover of their book. I am hoping that Mr. Feist makes another attempt at reaching the writing abilities that I know he is capable of."
4,"A good read, but not up to the quality expected of Feist","The depth and texture of his characters set Feist apart from the rest of the fantasy field, so it's a shame that this last installment is so similar to the attempts of other fantasy writers. The characters are flat, and rarely have the engaging personalities that makes the riftwar series so compelling. Even current characters like Eric, Nakor and Roo that once carried the story are sideline participants so that this ""epic"" tale can be told. The scale of this story has become so large, and the cast of characters so confusing, that the personal nature of the story is lost in the attempt. Still, Feist is an excellent writer whose mediocre stories are better than 90% of the best submissions by others. Only Julian May can weave a better story."
5,I'll wait for the Aussie release,This book will be cool. I just pity you Americans with that hideous cover. The cover alone is reason enough to wait for the Aussie release. The covers we get are awesome. Cheers!
5,Feist strikes again!,"Of course I haven't read this yet, but it looks to be yet another great book from my favourite author, Raymond E. Feist! I wonder what it will be about, since it seems that he wrapped up a lot of the story already in Rage of a Demon King (At least I think he did...can't talk about it much -spoilers!). Whatever happens in the story, it will be very good reading! Hmmm... I wonder what he will write after this book....?"
3,Doesn't have the good grace to lie down and die,"This is one of those books where you sit and think to yourself ""Gee if the author had just stopped at the previous book thing would have been cool.""No that would have been too easy instead this book stumbles along kinda half-baked while there are a few fun moments such as with Jimmy and Dash and their chocies in life this book is totally forgetable. Its a shame really..the chausm between the first and fourth book as a mile wide when you take into account like things like plot and charecter development.Overall-if you thought this book was bad don'tgo any further Feist only compounds his errors in the next two books."
1,THIS BOOK IS THE WORST IDEA SINCE FEIST KILLED OFF VALHERU,"Pus is one of the most powerful magicians in the Universe, but he almost gets beat by a dream of a god, whom he simply throws back into a ditch...Feist, you just lost a fan!"
4,Classic Thorogood,"BAD TO THE BONE is classic George Thorogood and his band the Destroyers. On this album we have 10 slabs of great blues-rock music that all music fans will enjoy. George helped to bring alot of the classic blues masters into the mainstream back in the 80's and early 90's when he was in his prime. On this album we have his classic title track that is enough of a reason to buy this album, but I think that the other songs are great also. BACK TO WENTZVILLE, NOBODY BUT ME, MISS LUANN, NO PARTICULAR PLACE TO GO are just furious rockin tunes that will get you moveing in no time. BLUE HIGHWAY, IT'S A SIN, AS THE YEARS GO PASSING BY are slower blues tempo songs that are pulled off very well here. George is still rockin 20 years after this release and hopefully we will still be getting some great music from him in the years to come"
3,Spirited but Sloppy,"This Burroughs Metal winner is a fine book for reviving one's appreciation for flight, packed as it is with ideas and enthusiasm, but I personally find the florid prose, superfluous content, sloppy logic, and dubious factual claims to be daunting. I hope to get more out of Murchie's later works."
5,What a beautiful doll!,"I purchased this doll as a gift hoping it would be as beautiful as the pictures and as durable as the information portrayed. It is gorgeous and appears to be very well designed to endure years of love. From the looks of the doll, it is one that should be placed on a shelf but the information contained within the shipment says it is made to use (it is machine washable!). I have no reason to believe this doll wont be around for a long time. I will order more for gifts."
5,Good book for my student,"This was a book originally given to Air Force Academy cadets to help them with their busy schedules and struggling grades. Now with a son in high school and heading to college, I purchased this gently used book (was formerly part of a library collection). Sure, the book was a bit used and tired, but the reading material inside makes for a great book for the student in your home."
2,Just for looks,Really good looking chair...fell apart once we started to use it.I need 9 more words to submit bad buy.
4,Beautiful Chair,"looks really great in my moms house, pretty sturdy - though you have to put it together yourself - but it's not IKEA cheap - it's good stuff. Highly recommended."
1,HORRIBLE,"This chair is so horrible. I really wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this lump of garbage I don't know what to do with. It did not come with all parts, horrible instructions and fell and cracked apart when we first sat on it. I am so mad. I don't have enough money to throw it away like this. Please do not give this company anymore money."
2,Looks Great But.....,"I bought this chair for my husband for his birthday because I really liked the way it looked, but after only 7 months BOTH arms came apart where there are seams (in the curviture of the arms). If it were only one arm doing it I might think it was a defective chair but with both doing it I would have to say it isn't made very well. I do have to add that my husband is a rather large man, 6'4"" and weighs about 290 lbs but if this chair doesn't support that it should state that in the description. I wouldn't recommend this chair for anyone weighing over 200 lbs."
1,"DO NOT PURCHASE, SERIOUSLY.","This rocker is a heap of junk. Not only did it come incomplete when delivered, waited for delivery of new parts, sent to wrong address, squeaks and makes rubbing noise when rocking, not proportionate from seat to floor(have to have very long legs) and now is just falling apart.This is a very poor constructed item and is not worth your time or money. Please dont purchase."
1,it's not working and ill spend have it's price if i ship it back,"i bought this product and i didn't expect that it wont work and the reason is it might work with 120v so i tried to send it back ,unfortunately i found it will cost me more than half its price and amazon wont cover more than 15 dollar so idecided to keep it till i find a way to fix it or in the future i could through it in the bin"
2,Dated Book,"I liked the story outline on the dust jacket but once I got into it I was turned off. The story was good and the space exploration facts were interesting. It was the social commentary that I was not waning to get bogged down with. I was looking for science fiction / action, not a George Will book. Overall the writing is good and the author spends a good deal of time on the characters, some times too much time. Overall this book just did not excite me and took too long to read."
5,Boy Scout Book,This book seemed to be unusual. Mr son-in-law loved it. He is a life long scout and it now leading a boy scout pack. So the book has come in very handy.
4,An insightful look into our past,"An excellent overview into how boys were (and perhaps still should be) raised back in the day when honor, competence, and personal responsibility were pretty much everything that mattered. Everything Sesame Street and daycare should be, but they are not even in the same game."
3,Get it for free,"This book with the original illustrations, including all the ads that were at the back of the book, can be downloaded as an ebook for free from Project Gutenberg."
5,Great book,"This book is essential for everyone...not just boyscouts or boys even, it is full of practical advice on just about everything- safty, tons of fun activities, being a good person, etc. an excellent book that keeps everyone from being 'bored' and encorages kids to make up their own fun. definatly worthwhile."
2,"Book ""A""t, your shipping an ""F""","I bought this as a gift and as far as the book itself, I was very happy with it and know the recipient was too. What I wasn't happy with was your shipping. The first book I got was mailed in a cardboard sleeve just the size of the book. Two of the hardback cover corners were smashed in and there was a dimple in the front cover. I chatted with your representative. I told her I wanted to send it back and would re-order if they could send it packaged better so it wouldn't damage the book. She said they would. Well, I got the second book packaged the same with different corners damaged but not a dimple in the front cover. Because I needed it for a gift, I kept it but I will NEVER again order a hardbook cover book from you, Amazon, again. It was a big bother with no better results."
4,depends on how you look at it,"the 1911 edition of the boy scout handbook is an amazing product . however this is only the way you see it. if you look at it as a replica, then yes. for the ads,diagrams,and print are accurate to the original. however as a manual itself is another story. it lacks diagrams and often leads the reader to imagine how this should be done. however this being it still is a very good read. i can't put mine down!"
3,Great refference guide,This works quite well for a digital copy. The only real downfall is the lack of checklists and pages for even taking digital notes. There is no way to keep track of what has and hasn't been done to complete the requirements like the real book has.
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for a simple reference guide to wilderness camping and hiking... I was in the Boy Scouts back in the 70's and remembered the wonderful things I was taught about camping and hiking. I figured that this earlier edition (1911) would be filled with a wealth of knowledge...wrong! Not only is the information incomplete and irrelevant to what I was seeking, the quality of print looked like someone copied it from a cheap printer and then made a book out of it. I guess it can serve at least one purpose when I go camping...as a fire starter."
1,"No pictures, just seemingly hand typed font.","I was expecting pictures, so I could see what flora and fauna actually look like.Instead, I got:[Illustration: Exercise 9.]Positions: Arms at vertical. Repeat exercise 8b.Without the illustrations, this book is less than worthless."
3,get it for free,"This book with the original illustrations, including all the ads that were at the back of the book, can be downloaded for free from Project Gutenberg."
3,"A bit too new, in my opinion","I have several versions of these reprinted Scout Handbooks. I dislike this one, as the size is now similar to the current handbooks, and the covers are a glossy type of card stock. I would greatly appreciate them going back to the more traditional printing, where the book is smaller and thicker, with more of a weathered look to them.Other than that, they are fine books, and it is interesting to see how things have changed over the last 100 years. I recommend that any Scout or former Scout get one.They are my preferred gift to a new Eagle Scout."
3,A run-on joke,"Magic players had been demanding more artifacts in the game for quite awhile. That is when WotC decided to be silly and build a block that was half artifacts. Mirrodin is not a bad set, but there is just too many artifacts. The cards are also not balanced; they are either bad, or they lead to degenerate decks that spoil the fun for everyone."
5,Try This One Out,"Haila Mompie's (aka Monpie, Momprie, etc) first solo album is a must. She has the sweetest voice and excellent musical sensiblities. The standard of musicianship on this record is excellent as well, as is the recording. Definitely not a cookie-cutter latino record."
2,Great Beat,"When I first heard the song, I would always get it stuck in my head. I was embarrassed to hear myself singing that I do both Jay and Jane. But overall, I love the beat, In don't like the lyrics."
4,Good for dance music lovers,"Dance music lovers will light up when they see the number of remixes on this single. The cover looks cheap, and the production work seems a little that way too, but this might actually crossover into the mainstream."
3,Good Tune...but that is about it,"Although a great single, and an overall good tune, this release by Larissa is void of anything of real substance. The lyrics are repetetive, the tune (on the radio edit) is anything BUT original...but keeping this in mind, the song is fun to dance to, and will keep you going in a rave. I like it, but it will be a short-lived hit."
5,Dont get caught singing along,"Yes I have to confess I sing along to this one, and I too get funny looks from people.Simply an amazing club tune, I originally got a part of this on Kyngnova orlando Breaks v4.0I just had to get the full version."
5,Awe-inspiring Song,"I don't understand why hardly anyone knows about this song. It is the beast of all dance songs out there right now, it just needs more publicity.So give it some!"
4,Au contraire! C'est tres amusant et drole,"This film is quite the charmer, as are all the characters and the French je ne sais quoi spirit as well. Set in the late 60's, but not focussed on the political ferment of the times, it starts off in a very Dickensian mood, but very quickly evolves into a delighful look into a particular quartier, where Jewish tradesmen take on apprentices (in this case two non-Jewish orphans) and the plot, such as it is, revolves around their growing affection for each other and the surrounding community as the two orphan friends find their metiers and manhood.Meanwhile the soundtrack is reminiscent of 8 1/2, with a certain circus atmosphere which permeates the film. It is a kind of pleasant supperealistic fantastic story that is peculiarly French and if you let yourself follow its well-defined universe, you are in for a treat."
2,A mix of comedy and passion does not make a movie a success!,"This film will not make the list of 100 best films ever, nor the top 200 or 300, but the film does make a decent effort to make you laugh. Overall, it is a decent film without any break through performances. The movie is the story of Fausto, an orphan who becomes an apprentice to an established tailor. Fausto, however, has dreams of becoming a fashion designer, particulary for women. Fausto's friend in the film provides much of comical relief, and is the only character who seems to have any depth.If you have a couple of hours to waste and need a good laugh, then you may want to watch this film. If you are looking for a good foriegn or french film however, I do not recommend you rent/buy this film."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I loved this book. Took me about three hours to read from beginning to end! I couldn't put it down and you won't either! The story is a great one, of two sisters who have inheritated a beach front property in Mexico and go down to sign some bank papers, taking a cruise to get there part away. They have some mishaps which will make you laugh and want to have a robe just like them!They become closer to each other and to the Lord, one already believing and the other drawing nearer every day. They meet a few interesting people and learn about others and ways of life along the way.You won't want to miss out on this book and I will be looking forward to all the others!! BRAVO!"
4,"Light-hearted, sister-bonding, good for laughs and inward thinking","I didn't expect to ""especially"" enjoy this book. It just happened to be our book club's May selection. But - for me - it was a great surprise! It was a quick read in that the writing was easy going and pleasing. And the story lines were funny & interesting. I very much enjoyed the obvious external story line. However, it was the internal, more subtle subject matters that brought me satisfaction and reading pleasure - and which I connected with ....I imagine other readers might find themselves also taking a moment to reflect upon themselves to imagine how THEY might relate (to the story line and the internal subject matter).So many funny one-liners and situations. Again, a quick read and I greatly enjoyed. Now I'm searching for the which of the other ""Sister Chicks"" I'd like to delve into...."
3,No Hit record,The best of Tommy Steele without his single HIT RECORD.I can't believe my eyes and ears for that.That's why I give only 3 stars.
1,Just a Proof of Concept. Not for daily use,"Nice feature set on paper, but terribly unstable.Dropped calls, regular auto-resets, Bluetooth headset spontaneous disconnects, unable to send sms unless reset, etcMaybe you can use as a PDA, but definitvely not as a business phone."
1,My new paper weight,"I loved the h6315 until it died. It was never dropped, left in a hot car, dropped in the toilet or shocked, but one day it died while I was on the internet. I tried everything to fix it to no avail. After 4 hours of bickering and ping pong transfers I finally got an HP technician on the line (Thanks to T-Mobile getting involved on a conference call). I received the ""$50.00 empty box"". I sent in the dead 6315 and found out that it would cost $250.00 in addition to the $50.00 to fix. The reason was system failure. I wouldn't recommend this Ipaq to anyone unless you can get one (with accessories) for under $100.00. HP should test failed units for free, heck I paid over $500.00 for it and the accessories and I got two and a half years out of it. Consumers wouldn't stand for service/treatment like this if their TVs, stereos, etc. lasted only two years. Look out Ebay here I come!"
1,What a piece of junk,"Don't be in the least tempted by the iPaq 6315, never have I come across a gadget with so many flaws, even with the latest software update that supposedly fixes the bugs. The problems are literally too many to list completely, the phone locks up, the bluetooth connection is flakey, dialogue boxes don't always close, and the latest fun thing on mine was for it to continually try to get a GPRS connection. This latest issue required a hard reset to solve, erasing all the data on the machine (I was travelling at the time).So, unless you don't really need to use it as a phone, are prepared to do daily soft resets and regular hard resets, buy something else.Oh, and don't look for support from HP. They've ""delegated"" any phone issues to the service provider."
4,Try Again,"My IPAQ h6300 received the software upgrade and since then has worked seamlessly. You need to turn off connections so it doesn't search for GPRS, etc. all the time. But that is easy to do with the connection manager. My bluetooth headset now works phenomenally too! It is great to be able to import all of my contacts from outlook and direct dial or email them just by tapping the phone number. Plus Wireless Internet built in, and Word, Excel, etc. on the fly. I have had a phone and PDA both for some time and it is convenient to have both in one, especially with the carrying case that comes with it. Get to know it, then you will love it."
4,my grandmother wrote this book!,"It's an adventure story sure to appeal to a young reader.My brothers and I always made fun of the book's German title,""Nouvats Grosse Fahrt.""I think my Grandmother won an award for this in 1934."
5,A wonderful book,This is a wonderful cookbook that not only delivers wonderful recipes but looks good at the same time. Roger Verge is informative and entertaining as he walks you through numerous planned meals. I have tried many of the recipes in this book and found all of them to be excellent.
1,Not Exactly What I'd Call Entertaining!,"I was so disappointed in this book. Roger Verge has brought the world of the impossible to home cooks. I don't think I know of any restaurants (and I have patronized many fine ones all over the world) require the ingredients found in this cookbook nor do they seem very appetizing. Roger has indeed embarked upon a ""new"" style in French entertaining if that is what he wishes to call it. Baby lobsters indeed! I, quite frankly, found his recipes just too bizarre."
5,Best in Class!,"This is an excellant film in nearly all regards. While the storyline is fairly ""mature"", the plot twists and characterizations are fresh and new. And as anyone with body art will attest, as the ink work progresses with patience and no little amount of discomfort, so to does the film. It's almost as if the frames of the next scene can't come soon enough! I've been looking for this film to add to my collection for some time. Harry Dean Stanton is a real sleeper here. GREAT acting. When the economics allow, it's spot is reserved."
1,Where's the noise canceling?,"Decent sound and comfortable fit, however all the noise canceling feature does, is add hiss.I looked at the turtle beach website to make sure I was not doing anything wrong, but the only relevant advice for me was the following""Q: My Turtle Beach buds don't cancel noise. I also own the $xxx plus Bose noise canceling headphones, so I know how they should work.A: Naturally, there will be a difference in performance. After all, the price is proportional to the quality and it is not fair at all to compare the Bose at 5-6 times the price with this inexpensive accessory.""I wish I had read this before buying them.In my opinion, save even more money and get a pair of sony buds without noise canceling, and enjoy a greater frequency range and no hiss!"
2,Wrong photo for the item,"Unfortunately, I was after the aftershave.... Not the spray on Eau de Toilette.Guys, it's critical to have the right photo for the items you sell.Also, why is it so damned hard to find quorum aftershave splash?"
3,Teenagers will love this movie!,"We watched the movie and although it did keep us interested with some very clever writing at some parts, it seemed as if the plot was too easily solved. This movie could have been a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but maybe the budget didn't allow to hire the best actors for all parts and props. Teenagers will like sweet romance that takes place within the adventure. It seemed like this was more of a made-for-TV movie than a feature film. Had the story had more twists and turns in it, it could have been really something for adults and kids... There could have been a few sequels to this movie if it had hit big. All in all, it was good and the location was cool!"
3,It's just OK,"I was quick to order some protection for my new IPad - and searching through available skins, I chose this one. It fits rather loosely and is thicker than I thought it might be. It does provide a bit more grip, which is good, especially when using the IPad to read books (as I do). But overall, I think that the c. $25.00 cost is FAR too much for this product. My recommendation for other IPad owners is to keep looking."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad...",I wouldn't suggest to buy this protector. When you apply it to the screen and try to peel the sticker off it leaves a horrible glue spot in the surface so is not useful at all.
4,A decent compilation,"If you are looking for the first album by Status Quo, keep looking. This is a German compilation of some of their earlier works. 3 of the tracks, I (Who Have Nothing), Hurdy Gurdy Man and Laticia are from when the band was known as The Spectres and without Rich Parfitt. Granted this early material is worth having, but not totally what I was expecting when I purchased this CD. Other than that, this shows what Quo was like when they first started playing the head-down power-chord boogie that they are now known for. Some of the highlites of this CD are Down The Dustpipe, Ice In The Sun, Spicks And Specks (written by the Bee Gees), and of cuorse, Pictures Of Matchstick Men. Buy this CD and you wont be disappointed."
5,MY favorite music.,"I was so happy to find another copy of this disk on amazon, as it has been discontinued for a while. I broke mine and love this band."
1,AWFUL,"The backpack slants at an odd angle forcing all four of my dogs feet together. We tried it on once, adjusting straps. Opted to return it only to be dinied full refund. Was told I failed to return PLASTIC bag it came in as well as the platform for the bottom of the bag. I did return ENTIRE product, have no use for a plastic bag nor a small piece of cardboard covered with lambswool. Avoid dealing with this company if you ever think you may have to return an item.Had to email them twice to ask why it had not shipped. The backpack itself would only be workable with a very small dog, mine is a 8lb malteese and was not comfy in it.The look of backpack is not bag but function is not what we thought it would be and customer service is the worst I have ever seen. I would give it ZERO stars"
5,I love it ;-),My puppy's Love it the bag is very stylish & very good value for money I would recommend this to anyone
3,Just OK,"This product says it's for animals up to 16lbs. I really don't think an animal that size would be comfortable. My dog is 12lbs. It's ok if he doesn't want to lay down. He can only be is upright position, which gets pretty tiring after too long. it should be a little wider to be comfortable for the animal."
1,Do not buy - the camisoles are made of rough and scratchy cotton,"I was expecting a soft-cotton camisole, but instead these camisoles are made of rough and scratchy cloth.I completely agree with the other reviewer that didn't like them. I also would have returned these, but paying the restocking fee and shipping would not make it worth the trouble."
3,I'm not so pleased,This product arrived on time and in perfect condition. They do shrink a bit when they're washed but they're long enough to fit someone 6 or 7 ft tall so shrinkage was not a problem.They were made in Mexico and for some reason I had thought it would be the USA. I found these shirts to be scratchy and uncomfortable even after they were washed. I would have returned them but this place charges a restocking fee and by the time you pay that and the shipping you only get back a few bucks. You live and learn I guess. But if you're looking for those nice soft undershirts like mama made you wear when you were little forget it and look elsewhere!
5,Mystery Off Glen Road,"Ordered this for granddaughter. I read all of the Trixie Belden books many years ago, got my daughter interested in them so she's also read all volumes. Now third generation is into the books! Great set of books for pre- and early teen girls."
3,Trixie Belden Mystery off Glen Road,"The book was ok, but it wasn't the best that I have read before. I didn't like how they didn't have a really good plot and they didn't have a real bad guy. It had some fun in it though. I also didn't like how they made it look like there was a bad guy but in the end it wasn't. This book wasn't the best I have read and I think it deserves 3 stars."
4,Imperdible,"Excelente trabajo que da cuenta de la historia economica del Perú en la última mitad del siglo XX,este libro que tuvo una edición en español,agadota por completo, es de gran utilidad para quienes quieran entender el desarrollo de Perú y su hasta ahora lenta lucha contra la desigualdad y falta de apoyo del estado hacia lsus habitantes.Imperdible."
1,NOT the Martin Sheen version!,"We were very disappointed that this was not the Martin Sheen version of this documentary that is shown on Smithsonian HD. The description should have mentioned this. In fact, the sound mixing throughout this version is terrible--anytime there is a loud scene with planes, tanks, or shooting, you can't hear the narrator. We plan to ask Amazon for a refund."
3,Youtube,No need to pay the high price per episode asked for here when you can watch the whole thing for free on youtube!
4,"not bad, if you can get your cats to use it","As described in the other reviews this simple box with a hole in it lets you keep the LM series in action longer between changes, and reduces the operating costs. You could build one yourself probably for $25 in parts, but even an experienced wood worker would take a couple of hours and you'd still have to find some appropriately sized continuous bags.I had a hard time getting my cats to use it. It's pretty high off the ground, and there's not a lot of space for them to land on. It seemed like they couldn't see where they were going so they stayed away. I eventually built them a 10"" high 'step' they could get on to ease their way into it.Be sure to remember to change the bag every couple of weeks, if not it will get so large that it will not come out of the cabinet and/or the bag will rip."
5,Wow! Wish I had this sooner!,"How much easier can you get? The automatic litter box works like always, it just dumps into a bag rather than the plastic container. I have 3 cats and I was constantly emptying the plastic container. Not only did it get expensive, it got messy. This is so much easier! The mess goes into a bag. You twist the bag, tie it off and cut it from the rest. You knot the bottom of the next bag. I don't have to touch messy litter. My cats are happy. I'm happy. Piece of cake!"
2,It was not corect,This product it is not correctly configured. You will need to make a few adjustments to make the top to actually fit.
3,Okay.,"The table was adequate, I had more problems with the littermaid product. Nice storage area underneath and nice finish to the outside."
5,Worth every penny,"This product has saved my marriage; we found ourselves constantly arguing about the odor in our house; we had the ScoopFree Self Cleaning box but it would last odor-free only for a couple of days. it reached to the point that I told my husband he had to choose between me and his cat. Finally, after a lot of research he found this wonderful masterpiece; he obviously had to switched to the Littlemaid litter box because this item won't work with the ScoopFree litter boxes. We have only one big cat but we do not have time to clean after him every day. We now do it only once a week. At first we were afraid the cat was not going to get used to it because he is old, but we placed it in the same spot as the old one and he began to use it immediately. The customer service is great.Needless to say both my husband and his cat are staying."
3,Amazing Grace and Chuck,"This movie was alright. it's great for young children who are learning about standing for what they believe in, regardless of the consequences. the principle of the movie was better than the acting. Despite the bad acting you find yourself lost in the situation, kind of like a what would you do? type of thing. Sit down watch with your children you'll be surprised with the conversation that will follow.Peace, Lise"
3,"what a gem, what a pearl","what an absolute delight, a gem of a piece of art, totally engrossing and a sort of movie you want to immediately, no, INSTANTLY, call friends and family alike, and tell them all about it...in great detail...on and on endlessly.....Joshua Zhulke's performance can be laid on pace with that of Henry Thomas in E.T., Haley Joel in Pay it Forward or Edges of the Lord or Barrett Oliver in Neverending Story.Awesome."
3,What-if fantasy of a bygone era.,Dated to an era when idealism was more common. Reminded me of the Harold and Maude genre (but not as well done). Not for reality TV fans.
1,Ultra Dumb,"I wanted to like this movie & I know that it's heart is in the right place, but it is probably the dumbest movie ever made. Dumb as in profoundly lacking in intelligence. As in trivializing something meaningful. I can't express how much I didn't like this."
1,This movie brings a new meaning to the word BAD.,"This movie is BAD. A stupid premise, a bad script, less realism than Disney could hope for, and poor execution.It is bad in every possible dimension of badness. Bad acting, bad directing, bad writing, bad script, bad editing...Well, maybe it wasn't THAT bad, but LORD, it wasn't good!One star is a compliment. It should have a negative rating."
3,"Good acting, weak story","This movie almost defines a three-star film for me. The acting of the four main characters is excellent and the movie is worth seeing just for that. The situation the story postulates is suspenseful and the action is fast-paced. However, the plot twists and turns get more and more unlikely, culminating in a showdown between Ryder (Travolta) and Garber (Washington) that is impossible to take seriously.So, the movie is a fun film to watch once, but don't see it twice or the holes in the story will overcome your suspension of disbelief."
4,The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3,"Pelham 1 2 3 is a good movie, I don't like the way it was shot which sadly seems to be the new style.(collateral)Travolta,Guzman,tuturo and Denzel do a helluva job,it's a big of a long one for a movie but it's good."
2,The Movie was Better,"I don't usually dis something on the grounds that the original was better. You'd think with the technology available today, a remake of The Taking... would be as least as good if not better than the original with Walter Matthau, but 5 minutes into the DVD and you know you're wrong. This is a lesson in how to take an exciting, engrossing, fast-paced plot and turn it into a plodding, badly acted, poorly executed ""who cares"" movie. We couldn't stay awake for this one."
3,"PROMISING START, BUT IT FALLS APART IN THE END! 2 1/2 STARS!","I'm a fan of the original witty film, but thought this remake would have given us a little more of an intense ride to update the original. While the story starts fairly strong, it doesn't add enough energy to replace the original's wit and charm. I also found with all the breakthrough technology that has occurred in the last 30-40 years, this film has some pretty stupid moments. i.e tracking device in the money bags (Hello!) and Travolta's character gives the authorities too many clues to figure out who he might be. It's an OK film for undiscriminating action junkies, but I rate this film 2 1/2 stars because it doesn't improve on the original in any way."
3,Good movie great acting,"This movie was pretty good. Denzel and John Travolta were awesome in it with no suprise. Near the end I was sitting on the edge of my chair almost the entire time. The movie does have some violence and most of it is cut out to a point. It's not as bad as some of the stuff they show on cable TV nowadays, but it's still bad enough. I enjoyed the movie."
3,Good remake,"Here we have another movie set in NYC, this time in it subway system. Denzel Washington plays the good guy and Travolta plays the bad guy. The plot is simple enough; a group of men take a subway car full of passengers hostage and hold them for ransom. They receive the ransom money and try to get away, but don't make it far due to Washington's cunning, quick thinking and craftiness. Besides the two main characters, the movie features a lot of smaller names such as James Gandolfini as NYC's mayor. I would consider this movie part drama and part action; the action part though is fairly short and not gory. There is some minimal comedy. All in all, an OK movie that didn't open to high expectations, but lived up to them."
1,Another Good Movie Totally Trashed by Hollywood,"If you don't mind the absolutely unregenerate language, you may like this movie. I was in the Army and never used the kind of language contained in this movie. Such a shame that the story line, great cinematography, and amazing special effects are ruined for me by taking the dialogue to its lowest common denominator, from teenager to adult. I want to be entertained without having to feel like a voyeur. I'll take the original of the this dramatic movie over the new one.mdv"
3,"Ok, but not great","For the record I have not read the book or seen the original movies so I can't compare this version to them. Overall the acting of John Travolta and Denzel Washington were wasted. They had good chemistry on set, but the movie lacked flavor. The biggest question that I feel that was not answered was the why question. Why take the train and demand hostages? I didn't feel that the characters did it just because they wanted to die as is presented in the movie, but over all not a horrible waste of time. It will be forgotten rather quickly though."
3,"2 great actors, 1 average movie.","This movie is about a thief that takes a subway train and it's passengers. He's after money, go figure. He talks to a transit authority official as his go between to get his money. They send him in to make a deal with the bad guy and save the passengers.This movie is very intense, but predictable. Travolta, and Washington are great actors. Despite their performance, this movie is just your average action flick. It's worth watching once, but not worth owning. I recommend just renting it."
5,Excellent movie!,"I've seen the movie several times and got it as a gift for someone. Love the story, how the whole movie evolves and especially love the ending. I've watched this movie several times and any time I find it on TV, I'll watch it again."
3,Satisfying but different from the original,"I never can truly enjoy a remake if I have liked the original. That was the case iwith the remake of a classic cat & mouse film made in the 70s and remade a few years back. The original featured Robert Shaw and Walter Matthau who take jabs at each other with a smile and a grin. In the remake, John Travolta is a sleazeball who taunts and humiliates Denzel washington. It is was too brutal and lacked style. Still, it entertained me but also made my skin crawl."
5,Well done,"Was actually surprised at how quick the DVD arrived. The padded packaging was marked ""Fragile, Please Handle with Care"" so that it was handled well. Good job. Wouldn't hesitate to use Jason's again in the future."
5,New York On Rail.,"Denzel and Travolta are at the top of there game in Pelham 123, but the real star of this movie is the New York Subway System. For me this is a movie I can watch over and over, and often do. Great action. Great cast. Makes this a solid movie."
1,highly successful at being utterly boring,"John Travolta's character shouting gets tired real soon. He's not scary, just annoyingly shrill. Denzel Washington's performance is flat and unbelievable.That's the whole problem with this poor imitation of the 1974 film - none of the performances are believable.It's a big snore."
2,Straight Forward And Shallow,"Considering the potential of all the actors involved with this film, I felt that the lack of plot twists and the uninteresting dialogue made this potentially engulfing movie lackluster and shallow."
3,Original A Bit Better,"I've driven NY City's subways for 30 years, so I had an interest in this movie right from the start. Obviously, there are mistakes thatare unknown to the general public, but that aside, the new Pelham doesn't pack the wallop that the 1973 Walter Mattheau version does. Too much of the action centers on Travolta & Luis Guzman, while the other two accomplices hardly utter any dialog; that's ridiculous!A real Transit dispatcher (Washington) would've NEVER commandeered a vehicle and tried to stop the thieves either! Tony Scott is a fine director, but he went for sensationalism instead of realism and the film suffers because of it. By all means see it, then see the original, and you'll know exactly what I mean."
4,Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,"If you like Denzel Washington or John Travolta this movie is a must see, turns and twists gallor. It will keep you rivited to your seat. One of the best films for sure in 2009."
1,The taking of 2 hours I'll never get back,"What a bad movie. There was absolutely no tension and you really didn't care about any of the characters. Also, there's almost no action up until the very end, and then it's not what you'd expect. Most of the time the train is sitting still in a tunnel underground and the two main characters are just talking back and forth. I guess the closest thing I can think to this was the negotiator, but Travolta and Washington bring not even the tiniest bit of drama to the screen, unlike Spacey and Jackson who you really cared about by the end and their performances were award worthy. Also, you actually started to care about the hostages in the negotiator and Spacey and Jackson. Plus, there was 10 times the amount of action in the negotiator even though it took place on a single floor of an office building for most of the movie. You'd figure about a train that was hijacked would have more action but you'd be wrong. I would not recommend this to anybody."
4,Pretty good remake,"Denzel good, not great; Travolta over the top; nice cameo by Gandolfini; faithful remake; good PQ & AQ; would have liked to have seen alternate ending to film though (as an extra feature)."
1,Why no rental?,"So Amazon says on its rental page you can rent it. You click on it, and you can only buy it. Why? This happens ALL the time with Amazon, which is why I am increasingly frustrated with their on-demand feature. Netflix and iTunes don't seem to have this problem."
2,Paint by Numbers,"Unfortunately an entirely predictable story populated by cliched characters - we've met all these guys before, in other movies, usually done better. The only ""twist"" in the plot took about 10 seconds to figure out. Can't anyone make an intelligent suspense movie any more?Note to filmmakers: you have the care chase(s), the maniacal killer, the plucky kid, the hero with a past, but you forgot the hot babe. If it's not going to be intellectually stimulating at least give us something distracting to look at."
3,Strong Cast Salvages Uneven Remake,"Denzel Washington and John Travolta make formidable adversaries in this erratic update of the 1974 thriller. Oscar winner Brian Helgeland's topical script gets diluted by Tony Scott's irritating music-video stylistics. The solid portrayals of Travolta, Washington, John Turturro and James Gandolfini keep ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" on track until it stumbles at the finish line with a needlessly protracted climax. Perhaps Scott should stick to MTV and leave the filmmaking in less-gimmicky hands."
3,Lots of techie stuff,"Well, I am a big fan of the original 70's. This kept some of it but it had the crashing/flipping cars and all the techie stuff. It was watchable; I enjoyed it but was quite disappointed in the last 5-10 minutes. I felt no closure."
2,This has been done before - and much better,"This movie is a complete throwaway. Denzel Washington's talent is completely wasted, and I was horribly saddened to learn that it was scripted by the same sreenplay writer of LA Confidential and Mystic River??? Those are 2 modern classics, and some of the dialogue in this movie was just laughable. How many times can Travolta call the authorities motherf-ers? And 'Bunghole'???! I had to try and not laugh out loud. You want to see an intelligent, taut heist thriller? Watch 'Inside Man.' Skip this re-tread, it's already be done. C- at best."
2,The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 DVD Review,"In my opinion, this remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 doesn't even come close to the original excellent 1974 film, which was directed by Joseph Sargent. The new version is tedious, boring, with a lot of vulgar dialogs, and pretentious acting. Luis Guzman, who is one of my favorite character actors, is totally wasted in this film. The musical score is inappropriate and doesn't match the action scenes at all. Note that at the end of the film, a police officer gives Denzel Washington a Walther PPK pistol for his protection, which he puts in his coat pocket. Later on when Denzel Washington pulls out the pistol, it is totally a different handgun."
1,Rated T for Torturous Travolta,"This movie should have been rated T for torturous.In the excellent 1974 thriller, the hijacker, magnificently played by Robert Shaw, barely raises his voice. Shaw created a deliciously mysterious villain. The wretched remake serves to showcase John Travolta's painfully annoying talent for reaching piercing decibel levels. Travolta's idea of dramatic effect is to assault the viewers with endless shouting. The entire film seems to be an assault on the viewers' senses. Denzel Washington's professionalism isn't enough to save this cinematic tsunami."
2,pelham123,"I like the movie but when I went to redeem the digital copy it expired.Not to happy with that.I wish i can get another digital copy so I can download,that would make me happy."
5,PELHAM REVIEW,"The direction was very astute, and John Travolta is up there with the best in Cinema.I was very pleased with the orginal and i truly think that this re-make can stand the test of time."
2,Could have been better...,"Both Denzel and Travolta did good work, and it's not their fault that they are not Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. So the problems fall to the Producer and Director. Why sandblast the original screenplay so bad? SPOILER: I really liked the Airborne hero bit, but why do you have to make Travolta a corrupt, racist and crazy Roman Catholic? Is there some secret club in Hollywood that requires you insult the faith (and from the looks of it, lose sales)of over a billion people on this planet? Couldn't he have just been a scary crook?"
2,A big disappointment,"Even disregarding the fact that I think the original production was superb, this remake was a *huge* disappointment. For starters, it seemed like every-other-word uttered by John Travolta's character was ""f--k"" (uh; slightly gratuitous?). Secondly, there was no fleshing out of the characters (including Travolta's) - and, in fact, the two hijackers who spoke some other (indistinguisable) language just seemed to be there as window dressing and there was no explanation of their connection to the others. For that matter, all of the passengers - except for the young guy with the laptop and the mother with a young son - were essentially irrelevant. There was also very little sense of NYC in this production and therefore it basically appeared to be a Hollywood stage set. The only moderately interesting character was Denzel Washington's (Walter Garber), but I wouldn't exactly call this one of his better roles."
2,Unfortunately Forgettable,"This version of Pelham did feature some interesting interaction between Travolta and Washington. The Blu-ray looked and sounded good, but the movie was missing something in script-writing. Maybe it was too much off-color language (replacing needed parts of the script)? I'm not sure, but only a few hours after watching it, I'm already starting to forget. Its probably worth a rental, but not a purchase."
3,The Taking of Pelham 123,Average Action too much use of foul language which seems to be typical of John Travolta movies. Not worth the extra costThe Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 [Blu-ray] for Blue Ray
3,An OK movie....wouldn't rent it in HD for the extra $,"Short attention span version:- Travolta IMHO always plays a great ""bad guy"" type character and in this movie expect the same- This is not so much action packed but will keep your attention- Movie does not delve into much character development and it's really hard to care about the characters- Seems ""too rushed"" things are ""just going on"" without much background or information- Nice for a rainy day and for a mindless flick- Don't expect to be sitting at the edge of your seats or expect a great ending...it just ends.Conclusion:Rent it if you like Travolta as a bad guy and you don't feel like thinking much. Otherwise skip it.2.5 stars (3 since Amazon only gives full stars)"
4,A great action thriller,"The taking of pelham 123 is a great action thriller.Have not seen the original this remake has been done very wellby director tony scott.His vision is superb filmaking and photography having filmed entirely in New York.John Travolta played an excellent hijacker,his portrayel of his character is very cunning and chilling.Denzel Washington also played an outstanding hero type character, there were some humor in this movie i like about and the action was very good.I would recommend this film to anyone who loves action suspense comedy.THANK YOU"
3,Just So So,"The movie was just okay, nothing to write home about or expect an award nomination for. Travolta did a very good job in his role, but Denzel was weak with his acting in this movie. Also the ending just fell short, after all the drama...then pop! it's over."
2,Good for a quick movie...,"The movie starts out fast paced and you kinda have to figure out what is going on at first, but I felt like I just didn't really care what was going on. The idea is to create mystery, who are these people and why do we care? The problem is the movie does it too well, I really just didn't connect with the characters. Although the actors are top notch, it feels like they just told them, ""hey you're this crazy dude who took over a train."" The end, so the film lacks depth, but it is decent for just a night when you don't have anything else to watch."
2,Disappointing!,"One cannot really expect too much from John Travolta - he needs the right vehicle and this wasn't it - but this was a shockingly poor performance from one of the best actors of our times, Denzel Washington. It was as if he wasn't really trying or as if he was just relying on inate quality to appear in his acting that just did not happen.Even visually disappointing...with High Def now, we except some ""Wows!""To understand what is being said here, watch the original."
3,Good thriller,"I have not seen the original version of this and so will not be writing a comparison.On its own, this is a pretty decent thriller, with Denzel as a man who is dealing with his own scandal and struggle as well as having to take on John Travolta as the angry, bitter man who wants revenge on the city of NY for past injuries. Tension and some bloodshed occur after JT and his cronies hijack a train underground and hold passengers hostage.Decent entertainment, though not all that memorable."
1,Suprised It was so bad,"Expected much more from this movie, C'mon it's John Travolta and Denzel Washington. Travolta just seemed to overact and you never get a feel as to what drives him in this film, no layers, no subtext, he's just a bad guy. Denzel who is usually so good, was very subdued, like he phoned this one in. And I wasn't buying James Gandolfini as the mayor. Throw in some unnecessary and unrealistic car crashes and you have a mess of a movie."
1,Pelham 123 is a very poor movie,What can't I say about this dog of movie One good thing is I did not pay good money watch it since I have a DVD/sat service and it was on a late viewing so I recorded and sorry I even took the time to do that. Dialog was full of profanity F this GD that MF ect. I think I counted at least 325 Mr bad guy John used one or the other. The other bad guys all they did was look around and act like a bunch of stiffs and gun tooting crazies. Mr Washington was just as bad he must and was not right guy for this role. Movie get a F and just like when ever they remake a classic movie they mess it up big time and this movie is no exception. Rate for this is an D and is not a family movie at all.
2,Typical boring modern film with no excitment like the old fims.,"THe 80s and 90s did classic jobs on films but modrn ones are too over the top and badly acted or are remakes which uses rather horrible cgi very frequent or just the actors are bad , this is bad its basically just another remake about a hostage ona train."
3,Disjointed,"While I think Travolta did a nice job creating an edgy character in this flick, the film was poorly assembled. For example, James Gandolfini announced at a particular point he was going somewhere (trying not to spoil anything here), and you never see him again. There was no reason for him to go, but he did, and that was that. A lot of background clues are dropped for the attentive viewer about where Travolta's character came from, and most are never resolved. They just hang there, so when the ending comes, you're surprised because there's so much unresolved information out there. Perhaps a director's cut might fix this one day, but I can't say it was much better than fair at it stands now."
2,Am I Hearing the Same Thing?,"....Frankly, I dont know what everyones talking about. This didn't strike me as anything special. I certainly dont think its worth making/buying this single. If this was on a full album it'd be a song I'd always skip. Although both Meth and Mary are talented, I wouldn't recommend this album."
4,Very Handy,I go to school online and therefore all of my materials are online. It's straight to the point and easy to understand versus the writing handbook I was provided by the university.
2,ok,"You will enjoy this book if you're a fan of sweet, less realistic romance.It being published under the Desire Series is decieving..."
2,OLD,"I absolutely love Sharon Sala, but I could tell from the very beginning that this was an old fashioned romance book. Just didn't hit the mark for me. (Ever other book of hers, I've given 5 stars!!)"
3,Predictable but fun,"This is an easy and fun read. Yes, it's predictable but it makes for a pleasant afternoon when you don't wish to be bogged down with something serious. It's fun to feature the character as the stodgy librarian, as well as an adventurous 'Amber.' And you have to like the old-maid Aunts..."
2,Classic - Not current,This book was a classic that was dated 30 years ago when I first read it. If you need perspective or hisorical info from that time it is an excellent guide.If you want a guide of info on current technology use the latest books by Shinsky or the current leading handbook (4th ed.) edited by Bela G. Liptak.
2,Needs some kind of answer verification,"The first few chapters are pretty straightforward. The problems are relatively comparable to the examples they give in the chapter. Once you get past part 1, the problems are not straightforward, and rely on special tricks or knowledge that could not be gained from the actual chapter. I believe this book would actually be useful if it gave final solutions to odd problems, or some other verification that you're understanding the problems/equations. The matlab functions served as a guide to testing your solutions for part 1, but once you get to part 2 the trouble becomes setting up the equations properly, not the calculus involved."
2,inadequate intro to process control,This book is not a good introductory to process control. Avoid this book at all cost !
5,The Small Business Millionaire,"I could not put the book down. It is such an easy read. Very moving. Anyone who wants to accomplish succes in their life, business owner or not, can benefit from this book. Wonderful formulas for success!"
5,"Easily Digestible, Valuable Advice for Business Owners","As a business owner, I loved the way this book put all of Steve and Sam's advice into a real-world format. Too often, with a non-fiction/self-help book, it's easy to get lost and to wonder, ""How do I apply this information to my business?"" With a fiction/story format, it's sometimes (and in my case, often) easier to see oneself in the same situations as the protagonists. Through such a vicarious experience, I am able to generate more ideas that can be directly applied to my business. As an English Teacher, I've always felt that if knowledge, be it practical or purely academic, were written in story format, students of any age would more readily comprehend. This book does just that. And on top of all that, it's a fun, quick read! As such, I highly recommend this book!"
3,Enjoyable reading !!,"I enjoyed this book, not only for some background on the real Lou Gehrig, but also for an honest viewpoint about the early 1900s in this country. The story Mrs. Gehrig tell about them growing up in the changing times of the new century was really interesting !!"
5,A lovely book,"This is a lovely book, and one I've used for a long time. I first ran into a copy in a library in Arizona while visiting my mother and brother. I copied some of the designs to try out and found them so satisfying that I ultimately purchased the book itself. It's one of my more treasured tatting books.Some of the designs are overwhelming, not because of the technique involved so much as for the time involved. I have little disposable free time, and a project of any great magnitude is likely to take an eternity. Some of the designs are very useful for tatted snowflakes, which I've made by the score for Christmas cards and tree ornaments. These projects are brief, the equipment small enough to fit into a pocket or purse to be done in spare moments--I've discovered I've the patience of a saint waiting in doctor's and dentist's offices or in line for anything--and are appreciated by most of the people who receive them as gifts."
3,a reproduction of books from the 30's,"A reprinting from earlier books including a large number of edgings, a few collar/yokes, baby bonnets, a booty pattern, doilies, medallions and table settings. The socklet edge designed for the baby booty pattern would make a great choker. The styles are typical of the period, some of the table settings make very nice doilies. There are several patterns that include a linen center also and a couple with insertions."
2,Meh! Soggy and Not Solid,"At first I was concerned that the product was made in China. But it states that it's all natural, free of artificial coloring and all that, so I bought it. However, it turned out to be not as ""air-tight"" as I'd like it to be. Feels a bit soggy and fluffy. Also, it lacks strong black sesame taste! In general, strong aroma is lacking, not to mention that it's on the pricey side. I wouldn't recommend this product if you desire a strong, solid taste of black sesame."
4,And This Is Laura,"This book was a great book! I loved how laura was physic, and could predict the future for other people and herself. The book is great except I think they could of let Dennis be missing for a longer time like for maybe a day or two. I would recomend this book to every person who is looking for a really exciting and a very interesting book. i would rate this book one-hundred stars if i could but i could only rate up to a five."
4,Good read,"This book reads well and has lots of of things of interest to say about this great, but flawed Englishman. One small niggle: the author has difficulty with the peerage system and titles [especially the sons of peers and the correct use of Royal Highness, which does not refer to the monarch]- okay, pretty trivial for most purposes, but fairly important for a historian of 18th century British politics."
3,Good but a little boring....,"I like that these are natural and organic, low cal and have fiber. I was surprised that there isn't much Vit C to speak of. A little boring; they would be better if they had some snap to them."
1,Chips were tough!,I was disappointed in the apple chips because they were tough and chewy. I had purchased another brand and they were very delicious. They were crisp and had a lot of flavor. These were a real let down.
2,I guess this is not for erverybody,"I took a chance and ordered this healthy organic product. I received my delivery today and I don't like the taste nor the soft texture. This is my first try at dry fruits, perhaps it is an acquired taste. Since I have 24 packs of them, I will give it a few more tries before I give them away during Halloween."
2,Crispy Green's freeze-dried apple chips tasted much better,"Amazon also carries Crispy Green's freeze-dried apple chipsCrispy Green's Fruit Snack, which tasted much better than this bake-dried one. Also freeze-dried keeps 90% of the original nutrition, while the bake-dried burns most of it. As a health product I would prefer the former. The only problem with Crispy Green's apple chips is ""Good but Expansive"" as one of its customer review puts it. As far as I know freez drying is very energy consuming. Now I found another product dried by a new drying method tasted just as good but the price is only half of Crispy Green's."
4,Only ONE Ingredient - WOW !!!,"I ordered two cases (48 pouches !) during the recent sale. Luckily, I like the taste of it very much. It's not crispy like some ""fried"" apple chips. It's a tad chewy but it tastes like REAL FUJI Apples. I checked the ingredient list and it only lists ONE: Organic Apples. It has No preservatives or added sugar - Gotta love that ! My only complaint is that yeah, some are not cored properly but I can't complain since I got such a great price on a top-quality product. My kids seem to like them too!"
5,Great snack on the go,"These apples tide over your hunger when your between meals. Tastes like what you'd expect: apples with a dry texture, which is great if you love apples like me. My vegan girlfriend has also stopped giving me a hard time about snacking on potato chips (100% organic). If you're climbing/hiking, the bag can be large, so dump it all into a small ziploc bag and it'll take up much less space in your bag."
3,worked for 6 months,"After 6 months, the plastic screws broke off but the seat itself showed no wear. It wasn't very expensive and I recommend buying a better seat."
3,"A hard book to read, yet difficult to let alone.","I am a fast reader. However, this book has taken me about two months to drudge through. I would have just put it aside and let it be, except that I became involved in the engaging characters. The story is tragically compelling, which forced me to return to my reading when the pages of hefty description and lofty narrative had no end in sight. James' complex and appealing characters as well as the inventive and dark themes are what saves this story from dying of the tiresome and hefty prose that paralyses the plot. This book will turn off most readers because it is difficult to muddle through. However, if you have patience and a little time this book can be a rewarding and memorable read."
2,Exhausting,"I'm a seasoned reader of the classics and have enjoyed other novels by James. This book took me four months to read and nearly killed me. After having read great literature almost non-stop for 10 years, I took a year's break from reading after this book. Enough said. I spent time reflecting on it - surely the hard slog was worth it? What was I missing? Other reviewers seemed to find depth to the book...But no, I wasn't touched or transformed, I learned nothing from the characters and felt no sympathy towards them. I felt empty and exhausted at the end. Perhaps that was the intended impact of the novel? If so, I give it 2 stars for achieving at least that."
4,"Molemen come through for Vakill, solid!","Sorta surprised that there aren't any reviews for this album, cuz it is dope! I think it is much better than Worst Fears Confirmed, which I found to suffer from poor production. Panik and Memo created some gritty uptempo bangers for Vakill, such as the title cut ""The Darkest Cloud"" and ""Til the World Blows Up."" Vakill sounds energized, dropping witty punchlines and creating vivid lyrics. His flow is solid and original. I would give this a 9/10 for a low A. Worth copping for sure."
2,Cool cover/flat vocals,"I just said it, listen to one song copy the vocals and paste them to the next, people say AC-DC songs sound the same has never heard this guy. I'd hate to ave himas a teacher, same tone, never rises or falls, if the music wasn't so loud his voice would put you to sleep. Try Nile,Bongzilla,Soilent Geen all from relapse records and by farr much better. Well thats my two cents"
4,Great Artist,"This is a great film for fans of the artist, Matthew Barney. While exploring his process for Drawing Restraint 9, it also references his previous work in Cremaster. The most valuable aspect of this film is Barney sharing about the symbolic nature and meaning behind his work."
4,"Check it out if you're a fan of avant-garde, esoteric, visceral, exotic artform!","A nice viewing experience. I'm waiting for an extensive Cremaster Set of somekind!! ""No Restraint"" offers some insights into Barney and leaves you wanting more."
1,Fer Christ Sake!,I Both love and hate this film. While it has the depth of apple skin it looks real perty. Any inbred would surely love it! If you gave this to a hillbilly I think he would give it back unless prompted by a corn cob pipe and a felt hat to keep it. I think you could drill out the center of the dvd and line it with some nice soft fur and use it for a marital aid.
2,Caveat Emptor!!!,Buyer Beware! The book I have is missing the first chapter (it starts on chapter 2). Consult w/ seller to make sure book has first chapter.
3,Illustrations are not very vivid or saturated.,"This is a lovely volume at a very attractive price. However, I was disappointed that the illustrations were not as good as I remember. Perhaps in childhood I had a different edition. The colors look somewhat washed out and, while there are many rhymes, there are not many full page illustrations.I probably had an edition with a much smaller number of the more interesting rhymes with each one illustrated by a very colorful picture. If I had known this volume was not of that type I would not have purchased it.I have seen photographs of the other available volume, titled, ""The Real Mother Goose"", and the colors seem to be more vivid. I wish I had known that before.It is all a matter of taste, of course."
5,Just like when I was a kid,"When I was very young I had a Mother Goose book with so many rhymes in it that it was staggering to even consider reading them all. But it also had vibrant, sometimes creepy, pictures that went along with them so I began reading them, slowly at first obviously, I was 5 and learning. Now that I have my own son I wanted him to be able to read the same rhymes with the same pictures. I searched everywhere but most Mother Goose collections have been abridged or even changed to make them more ""feel goodie"". Well this is the original and it's the one you want if you love Mother Goose. It has all the rhymes and all the same creepy artwork from when I was a kid. The only difference is the cover is purple instead of green. Every child should own a copy of this collection:)"
1,Frighteningly outdated,"The illustrations are wonderful, but they are they only thing I like about this book. The poems too often have subject matter of social class division, whipping or beating ""bad"" children or adults, and animal cruelty. In addition to this, the layout and typography of this edition are terrible! It is actually difficult to read the text, not a good thing in a book meant to be read aloud. I understand that this edition is based on the 1916 version, but on reading these ""original"" versions of the poems, in their ""original"" layout, I am convinced that there is good reason to update this material. I would love to see the beautiful illustrations pared with updated text (and typography!). This version may have value as an historical record of how much society has changed, but there is no place for it on my daughter's bookshelf."
1,Not worth it,"Bought this product to edge around flower beds. Doesn't work all that great. Blade is not sharp enough to cut though grass/grass roots and sharpening it will destroy the coating that prevents it from rusting. Requires using more effort than necessary to cut a nice edge and most of the time, does not create a crisp edge. Would probably work well if the blade was sharper."
4,A good start for Lindenmuth,"This film, which is actually nothing more than a retitled VAMPIRES AND OTHER STEREOTYPES, shows the energy and creativity that thrives in the low-to-no budget horror field. Director Lindenmuth, making his directorial debut here, brings quite a bit of freshness to what is an otherwise pedestrian affair. Anyone watching this should go into it not expecting Interview With The Vampire part 2. If you do, it's all over. But if you look at it for what it is, you should enjoy it greatly."
1,A Matter of Justice (Final Justice),"Yes, DO NO buy this DVD. It was butchered and not the whole movie. It was a great movie I have watched over and over so I could tell you the scenes deleted. I hope everyone else got their money back, I didn't."
1,an unhappy customer,The movie would not play so I spent 30.00 for nothing. Other than that all the other movies played and I was happy about that
1,DISSAPOINTED,"I was also EXTREMELY dissappointed. They butchered an excellent movie by cutting it as they did, leaving out curcial parts. There are huge gaps in the story line. AMAZON should have noted this in their description!"
5,The True Story,The true story behind this movie and book can be found at the link below. it's a website of movies based on true storieshttp://amatterofjusticeakafinaljusticemovie.blogspot.com/it has pics of both the real chris and dusty brown
1,Extremely disappointing! Save your money -- do not buy this DVD!,"I am extremely disappointed in this DVD. I first saw this movie as a mini-series called ""A Matter of Justice."" The editing is a real butcher job. A great move has been destroyed in this production. I hope someone puts the full production on DVD some day soon."
2,Final Justice,"I have seen this movie on TV a dozen or so times. I was very disappointed in this video. Sooooooo much of the familar scenes were cut out, and one scene was added that, in my opinon, was not needed. I prefer the TV version. I was not happy with the cut scenes at all. :( :( :(Therefore, if you are an avid fan of the tv version of this movie DO NOT BUY this dvd."
4,Plucky Brit rips lid off of conspiracy-and no one cares,"When I picked up Pritchard's book, I expected the usual right-wing pastiche of innuendo and speculation. How pleasant to be proven wrong! Far from being a political diatribe, ""Secret Life..."" is an in-depth expose' of some of the nastiest secrets our shadow government currently holds (or did). Taking its information from news stories, personal interviews and all manner of legal and governmental documents, this book delves where others dare not and demands consideration of the information within. The one problem is that the first 1/3 of the book concerns the Oklahoma bombing and various agencies' attempts to distort and conceal the facts concerning their involvement in and foreknowledge of the event rather than focusing on whatever involvement Bill Clinton may have had (which seems minimal, if only in this instance). Nevertheless, this book is an invaluable source of information for the student of modern government and/or conspiracy."
4,"Bob Woodward, America needs you","No reader, except Bill Clinton, can be intellectually honestand at the same time confirm or deny the allegations in this book.However, the multiplicity of events, witnesses, ""coincidences"", and convenient memory lapses and lost records strain all credibility that Bill Clinton is merely a Boy Scout under scurrilous attack from rightwing extremists.Why has the mainstream media been so slovenly and/or biased in their lack of pursuit of these potential ""Pulitzer Prize"" winning stories? The OK City bombing allegations alone, cry for ""independent"" verification.If Bob Woodward is unavailable, how about Geraldo?"
4,All the things every American Should Know -- but doesn't!,"The author, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, a British newspaperman, came to the States without preconceived judgment of the Clintons, an attitude which changed as time passed. He observed the difference between public utterances and private behavior too often screened from view by a fawning press which persists even unto today. Barnum said you can fool some of the people some of the time but you can't fool all of the people all of the time, but the Clintons et al made a pretty good stab at it --. No one should go to the polls to vote without having read Pritchard."
4,Is it true?,Its not wheather this is a muckraking piece of journalism;it's the question of truth.If even half of these allegations are true then American Democracy is in for some rough sledding indeed.
5,Amorality at its best,"Despite the voluminous documentation of corruption and callous disregard for the ethical standards of the offices in which Mr. Clinton has held, this book points the finger of damnation directly at the American political system itself. Evans-Pritchard's detachment from the typical biases of American political reporting has allowed him to disperse blame on both sides of the aisle. After reading this book you will not only know what Bill Clinton has been party to, but why he can get away with it time and again. It is not possible to read this book with an open mind and not come away with serious misgivings as to the direction our political process has taken."
5,Shame on you Bill Clinton and Shame on us America!,"I think the thing that really got my blood boiling was how ordinary people have been treated by U.S. representatives as described in this book. This book exposes the immense evil syndicate that our governmet has become. Ambrose clearly tells how we got where we are, regarding this administration. We have had our blinders on and it is past time for us to take them off. I for one will be handing this book, (and others like it) to friends, family and co-workers. This book is yet another piece of what may well lead this country to a much needed second Revolution."
3,The Title Doesn't Fit This Book,"A few pages into this book I began to wonder why it was titled, The Secret Life of Bill Clinton. After 92 pages of Oklahoma Bombing conspiracy notes, I was absolutely sure his editor had chosen the title to sell more books. Evans-Pritchard may be an ace investigator, but the details he reports on in this section of the book are tenuous at best. Still, the reader is left with the disconcerting thought that no ATF agents were killed, wounded or even there that day. An ATF sting gone bad? Probably. The Vince Foster material borrows heavily from Christopher Ruddy's work. The final material on Mena is well known and merely re-hashes old information. Personally, I would not waste my time or money on this tome. Of course I did, but then maybe I can spare you the same fate!"
2,"Easy reading, seems factual, but no cigar!","The book deserves a place on the president's libraryof critics but it should be read with guarded optimism. There are a few things the author seems to misunderstand about our government.Unlike Britain, we like to bring new faces into our presidency every few years. It serves to refresh our minds and the oval office. Then we take great sport to pick on the president to see if he can stand up to the grind of it all. In Brirain, the royals are in for life and they stay amidst the critics. When the author cries foul at the notion of the president replaciing all the US Attorneys upon taking office, that's his right, he can replace every political appointee at will, for any or no reason.All in all, it was a fairly good book but nothing to write home about."
2,"book is dry, without real content.","The title leads you to believe that the contents will be about unreported stories about Clinton in the White House. Instead you are lead through chapters of dry, humourless dribble about the oklahoma bombing and other events where clintons name is seldom even mentioned. The list of characters are dull, and seem to be in a play all their own outside of the title of the book. It is hard reading that does not make much sense and I found the entire book to be listless, and long, without much purpose at all. The authors must be three dry, dull professors who have little to do but confuse the reader when ever possible. This book is hardley a barnburner, and I found it easy to put down. What I found hard, was continuing to read it."
1,Evans-Pritchard commits logical falacies,"I had gotten about half way through the first chapter of Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's book ""The Secret Life of Bill Clinton"" before I figured out that he had forgotten two topics I usually place under the heading of ""The World is a Funny Place."" 1. If you have a bad event, it almost always the result of incompetence, not conspiracy. Incompetence is so much more common than conspiracy that you have to have definite proof of the latter. 2. After-the-fact coincidences are common. People assume that because before-the-fact coincidences are rare, that after-the-fact ones are also. In fact, they are very common. There is a story somewhere that Abe Lincoln always had a secretary named Henry, or something like that. It was just coincidence. As I recall Evans-Pritchard does a little guilt-by-association too, but incidences of that are easy to spot."
1,What a waste of trees used to print this thing,"Fortunately, I borrowed this from the library so I didn't waste any money on it. The only thing that kept me from giving the book a 1 was the entertaining nature of the charges. After a while, you just have to laugh! What truly strains the author's credibility is the assertion that President Clinton is directly responsible for everything from the Oklahoma City bombing to a teacher in Arkansas' foreclosed mortgage. If he's really THIS powerful, people like the author, Aldridge, and Limbaugh would have been shut up LONG ago. If you enjoy anti-Clinton conspiracy theories and STILL can't accept the election results, then you'll probably LOVE this book -- and I guess buying it is better than sending the money to the militias. However, if you don't fit that tiny sub-group, don't waste your money."
1,Use as toilet paper,"I was so sorry I read this book. It seems a sure way to make quick cash these days is to write some anti-Clinton garbage. There is a ready market of white trash out there who eat this stuff up. Seen any Black Helicoptors lately, Gary?"
5,Succinctly and objectively written as the British do so well,"Evans-Pritchard fills in the details of Clintons sordid scandals, which incidentally, are meticulously documented in the appendices. It is a depressing book until the epilogue. I recommend it to anyone who is objective, believes in the Constitution and believes in Common Law."
5,IT MAKES YOU THINK ! SHOCKING ! NOT JUST SEX !,This book is not the easiest reading since he has packed every page with information and backs each up with sorces and copys of real documents. He has given you the facts and is letting you make you own mind up what really happened. It is so unlike the T.V. news that is many times only part truths and is ofter very slanted to their own opinion. Every one needs to read this book. America needs more authors who are not afraid to lose their and their contacts if they write the truth. !
1,Another anti-Clinton book,"This book doesn't even deserve a ""1 Star."" Another book with no substance or truth. It will confirm the beliefs of the right-wingers, because they believe it and want you to believe it."
1,Competition for the National Enquirer,This book is a total waste of time and not worth reading except for slimmers.
1,Pot calling the kettle black,"Oh, the horror! Read about all of the awful things Clinton did. Of course nothing any worse than pretty much any other president has done. Maybe Clinton ran over the author's dog or something, but the very nature of the book seems to imply that Clinton was somehow unique in the corruption of his office. Not even remotely so. For a real comedic follow up perhaps the author could write of the pristine and angelic terms of Reagan and Bush."
4,The Craft of Cable-Stitch Knitting,"1. I do not own this book. I borrowed it from a library to determine if I want to acquire it.2. According to the copyright page, it was printed in 1971 Barbara G. Walker. This book was originally published as part of ""A Treasury of Knitting Patterns"" and ""A Second Treasury of Knitting Patterns"".3. You can purchase both of these books from Amazon for $30.00 each.4. Content? As with any Barbara G. Walker knitting book - EXCELLENT.128 pagesChapter 1: CablesChapter 2: Cable-Stitch PatternsChapter 3: Twist-Stitch Patterns"
2,Very cheaply made - lasted two weeks,The plastic is brittle and broke on the first little impact and I found in impossible to glue back together.
1,Flimsy toy,"The wheels are flimsy. One of them fell off immediately upon opening, and I discovered the other one on the same axle had the axle pushed all the way through it. Cannot be remedied. My son fell in love with it as soon as he saw it, so I'm hoping we can at least find a new one to exchange it for and that it lasts more than a few minutes."
3,Dryer booster fan,Fan is working great. Shipping was very slow(took a month to get). Has really cut down on drying time for our dryer.
4,Works great.,"So far so good... I have a 50ft run of ventilation, and it's always been a problem for me. With this fan I have finally got enough push to dry my clothing. It's also surprisingly quite. Install instructions are a little vague, but not horrible."
4,i think irene is one of the best,i went to a rave she was at and she was dope she made the place roc
3,It's no Hard House Diva !!!,"Don't get me wrong...the cd is good. However, compared to DJ Irene's Hard House Diva, the cd is just alright. I was hoping Tetris '98 would be the full mix but unfortunately its only 25 seconds long. Laura B does well in finishing off the cd, making it worth buying!"
5,A Very Useful Book,I used this book as a graduate student and continue to use it today. I especially like the examples and literature review.
3,Toddler Tunes,"The dvd is ok, was a little disappointed in that the words do not match the movement of the kids lips."
3,I only listen to Eek-ah-bo-Static Automatic,"I only gave it three stars because the only things I've listened to are ""Love & Affection,"" and ""Eek-ah-bo-Static Automatic"" because both feature some of the last recorded performances by Sly Stone. Eek-ah-bo-Static Automatic is a good clue as to what a comeback by Sly Stone might sound like; it is solid phuture-phunk, with nice electronic falsetto towards the end. It is dissapointing that this is all there is, however. Sly lives!"
3,"Solid mystery, awful romance","Chan is assigned to discover who murdered an aging movie star shortly after she arrived in 1920's Honolulu. There are some nice obvious clues, but one after another falls apart as a fortuneteller appears eager to help Chan solve the crime.Classic and well-done don't-believe-anyone situations, with more overt racism than Biggers has revealed before. Maybe in the atmosphere of the 1920's, he was afraid of alienating white readers by showing both white prejudgment and something other than a bland non-reaction on the Asian's part. The romance was unbelievable as usual, and the reader wasn't given the information to figure out whodunit until a few sentences before Chan announced it. Biggers strained to relate the title to the story - there was no mention of a black camel in earlier books in the series."
4,Charlie Chan And The Movie Star,"Movie star Sheila Fane arrives in Honolulu to shoot the few remaining sequences of a movie. She rents a house on the beach. When Sheila throws a big party, she is found murdered in the pavillion just before she is scheduled to make her grand entrance. Charlie Chan is assigned to the case. Tarneverro, a fortuneteller and former friend of the deceased, offers to help Charlie solve the murder. Charlie and Tarneverro arrive at the scene of the crime before the guests depart. Although not the best of the six Charlie Chan novels, this is a very good mystery and an entertaining story."
3,Pretty Sad about the color Switch,"This is a well put together pack. However, I wanted a cheery looking pack, that would lift my spirits when hiking. The pack shipped is all black with sides of dark blue and all the straps are black and gray. While it seems a silly type of complaint I feel there has been a bait and switch. Why not put up a picture of the pack they are selling?"
2,Teton Sports Fox,"I bought this pack for my trip to Europe. My concern is that it is very heavy with out cloths, food, shoes. ect... it seems very durable and it is a great size for a woman. Another Dislike is that there are to many straps/buckles. the straps/buckles are not removable and really after un buckling them to fix the positioning its like a maze to put it back together. and then theres the rain cover. Really does it need its own compartment? its possitioned at the very top of the bag and its not removable. so for the most part the bag is just ok.... i guess its true you get what you pay for."
1,IT's not a good bag !,"It's not a good bag ,and the design has a redundant construction !It might bring inconvenience to traveling .Since I have find the red color is not the same as the picture shows!I am not good luck to brought this one"
5,Awesome pack,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I've been using the same pack as I had in boy scouts over ten years ago, but after my latest long weekend trek along the AT with some buddies, I really wanted a new one but didn't have the cash for a nice one. The lightening deal on this pack was great, and even further the pack itself is awesome. Plenty of pockets and straps on the exterior so that you have more equipment accessible during a hike. This is my first internal pack, and I'm loving it. The material seems of high quality and should stand up to hiking through brush, etc."
4,Great value and performance,"I am not a frequent camper or backpacker...so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a backpack for my hiking trip to Havasupai in Arizona. I'm glad I bought this pack. I loaded it with 30-35 pounds for the 10 mile hike to the Supai campgrounds and had no problems at all. My only complaint is the unpadded stabilizer strap..it wasn't a problem, but would have been more comfortable with padding. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with this pack at this price. If you don't backpack very often, and just need a sturdy bag...buy this one. You won't be sorry."
5,"for the $, great pack","I have been using this pack for about 2 yrs now and have only came across one major defect in my opinion. The pack has been used in a number of different situation, all including down pours of rain for consecutive days.The rain cover was a wonderful feature to have included,it doesn't take much space or add much weight. The pack was easy to get in even in difficult weather. It dries out pretty fast. I do recommend the use of a water proofing spray. The only defect I can really complain about is the sleeping bag compartment zipper. It binds up and bends making it impossible to zip shut after opening. This is a real pain in the @#$%^&. All in all its a great value."
2,Disappointed,"I research virtually every product I purchase and did so with this item also. I felt pretty good about it until my son tried to strap his tent onto it and two of the straps broke. Now, his tent is a lightweight one, made for backpacking and hiking so weight wouldn't have been an issue. This backpack hasn't even made it outside yet. We are having the straps repaired (instead of sending it for a replacement)as his hiking trip is less than a week. If there are more issues after his trip I will be adding them to this review."
5,Totally worth for the value...great Backpack,"This is backpack I bought for my first back country backpacking to Yellow Stone. I could easily carry stuff for 2 people.This one is really great with excellent back support and cushioning. I had no problem carrying it for almost 20 miles.I got it at a great deal and it was totally worth it.It is really big if you want a backpack for just 1 person, but it is any ways worth it even if you don't want to carry much stuff and keep a part of it empty."
4,Good Deal on Reasonable pack.,"Bought this for my son doing a 5-day hike in the Sierras. Worked fine. Big enough and didn't rip or break. My son, at 6'1"", found it comfortable. I'm prejudiced toward exterior frames, but thought it was a decent pack for occasional/casual backpacking. Believe we'll be using for years to come."
3,Not for tall people,"This pack has a ton of space, great pockets and features all over it, and is probably very comfortable for people under 6'. It's not built for someone over that, though. After using it for about a mile my shoulders began to hurt and eventually I was in extreme pain. The weight doesn't transfer to your hips well, it was probably 50% on my shoulders. The lifter straps attach to the back of the head of the pack rather than the frames like they should, which contributes to the problem. I contacted Teton about the problem and they sent me a new model free of charge. Great company, great features on the pack, but construction could be better. Again, be wary if you're on the taller side."
4,Great for the price,This is a great backback for the price. Not the lightest pack for the capacity (which is decent) but not overly heavy (and cheap - I think I paid about $60). I found it very comfortable for a 4 days grand canyon trip. I did not like the side pockets - not very accessible and wierd shape that precluded putting water bottle in them. Overall a good pack.
4,nice bag/good price,I purchased this bag for a two week backpacking trip. I was very satified with the product. There was plenty of storage and many compartment options. The bag proved to withstand the airport baggage and the padding made it comfortable to carry.
2,Queja,"solo coloque dos estrella por que compre dos bolsos por separados y los envio en un mismo envio y una sola factura, por ende me cobraron nacionalización."
3,Not Quite Sure Yet...,"Teton Sports 5200 Internal Frame Backpack; After buying 2 of these items I realized that I will have to take one back. My 12 yr old boy it perfect for. As for me I am a larger man and there is no way I could ever get my sleeping bag, tent, cloths, and food for more that a weekend trip. After putting the food in I had like room for one extra pair of cloths.It is perfect for my son however. It would be great for a week trip if you were to use ALL backpacking equipment. (ie. tent, bag, cook wear, mess kit, etc...)The only other issue is the side pockets. I don't like the one sided pop out.I am donating my pack to the Troop 745 in Oregon City, OR. I bought a bit of a nicer one here [...]"
1,cheap,"Received this pack in the mail and everything was in good condition checked all seams clips and straps. When I put it on I realized that the pack is meant for shorter people (I'm 6' 3""). It appears that 6' and up won't be able to wear this pack properly. On the other hand, I put my sleeping bag in it's compression sack in the bottom just to gauge the size of the pack (it looks small when you first get it) and the colored so-called ripstop material tore about 8 inches just putting the compression sack in the bottom which took no force at all I'm not sure how it ripped so easily nor will I purchase more Teton ""ripstop"" material bags."
4,Great bag for the money,The backpack is a great value for the money. There are only 2 things i dont like about it... the main internal part of the bag seems small compared to the size of the bag and the weight is a bit on the heavy side. It is very comfortable to travel in and there are pockets galore. I like that you can extend the torso part of the bag for comfort. The bottom outside pocket is great to put shoes in or anything that is wet. I highly recommend this bag for the money.
5,"Well Constructed, Large Capacity, Light Weight, and Comfortable","This back pack is Well Constructed, Large Capacity, Light Weight, and Comfortable. It also comes with a rain fly cover and a detachable belt bag which is very nice for small hikes, or as an emergency stuff pack that is placed at the top of the back pack when attached to it. I like it. I recomend it."
4,Very Good Bag for the Price,"The bag is spacious, good material and perfect for its purpose. I am happy with the purchase for that price it is a great bag."
4,TOO MANY STRAPS!!,"I bought this bag based on reviews. I am NO ""backpacker"" but I wanted something for my every weekened 2/3 day trips that had size. This bag has a great size but the straps will get to you. I don't even know what I am tightening/loosening. The bag is awesome all around though."
4,Good first impression for the most part,"I got the pack and loaded it up with all my gear. I adjusted the hip straps trying to get the load to rest on my hip. When I did, the stitches holding the straps down started popping. It wasn't enough to rip them off but I was surprised at the lack of strength in them. I am 6'3"" and have a long torso so even at the highest setting the shoulder and hips were too close together but it didn't bother me too bad. It started raining and the included rain fly was a life saver. The other guys I was with were jealous that all my gear was staying dry.Hopefully it is just a fluke that the stitches were weak because I think this is definitely a high quality pack. Plenty of storage and it is comfortable especially if you have a shorter torso."
4,"Choice, indeed but not FIRST choice","The first disc has 15 tunes (63:24) and on the second disc, there's 18 tunes (66:50). Louis sings lead on all but one song on the first disc. The second disc is mainly Teagarden. A few tunes are instrumental.The sound quality is fair to good, for the most part, but never stellar.Just an FYI - the packaging on this item is unusually attractive/well designed. There's mylar threads that shine in the light through the white finish (inside and out) and the center buttons that hold the discs in place are nicely made. Notes in the accompanying booklet give details on the individual performances."
4,Very Good!,"This is one of the main publications about reptiles in Brazil. And one of the very few publications about such theme. It has excellent pictures and text, although it was wroten in a scientific language, limiting thus its public to academic students and researchers."
5,Well done Amazon,"I recently purchased a LiteOn DVD Writer Model (LH-20A1L06C) with a gift certificate I received for christmas. I was looking for a LightScribe model at a inexpensive price, needless to say Amazon had just the item I was looking for. I have built all the computers I own at present and found the installation to be fast and trouble free. The most pleasant part or my purchase was the shipping. The projected time I was to receive my drive (UPS ground) was 3 to 5 days, it arrived to my location in 2 days, how awesome that. :-) Thank You Amazon"
2,"[raises hand] I did it too, Needed IDE this is SATA","This is a SATA drive, it even says so but you have to read everything there is to possibly read about it. If I were selling it I would have SATA in the header. But, this is my fault. I'll return it and get the one I need and pay more attention to what I am buying. I gave it a two just because of no SATA mentioned in the header for those of us who don't pay attention. Good thing I didn't open the box first. Other than that I know this brand and stand by it, in fact when I do get the right one it will be Lite-On."
1,Lite -on w/light scribe,Product said it contained lightscribe as of yet My software does not find the lightscribe element. everthing else works. Not to happy.
1,Incompatable,Was a SATA only and wasn't advertised as such. Therefore it was uncompatable and I had to pay shipping to return it.
