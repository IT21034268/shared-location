5,"C'mon, it's the Beatles!","I'm only 18 and I am probably the biggest Beatle's fan that ever lived, so saying that only ""old farts"" defend this album is untrue. Although I enjoy listening to the Who, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, the Stones, Dylan, Nirvana and Metallica, none of them even hold a candle up to the Beatles. This is one of my favorite CDs, so buy it if you want to laugh, cry and try to find hidden meanings (that probably aren't even there). This album made big impressions on everyone, and the fact that all these people are arguing over it proves it!"
3,Well. I don't know...,"The album itself is weak, when compared to other Beatle work (for any other group it might be the best album they ever made), but I happened to enjoy receiving the new disc for Xmas. I always wanted an import with the stamped # and the name in raised type. I thought that the american version of the cover took away it's subtlety, and made it no longer a brilliant antithesis to the busy Pepper cover. And getting exactly what you would have gotten when buying the LP (i.e. the poster and pictures, just minaturized) is more like what I want a CD to be, exactly like the original LP, artwork and all, just smaller."
5,The most influential album,"Black Francis, the leader of the Pixies, once said ""The White Album is our favorite record. We've listened to it so many times that we can play the whole album without any preparation."" The white album has always been an immense inspiration to numerous creative musicians. Arguably the most influential album ever recorded."
3,a little dissapointed,"I was a little surprised at what I actually got.No Apple lable, no imbossed title, and as for the photos,I got 2Ringos and no George."
5,HAPPINESS IS THE WHITE ALBUM!!!,"This is a great album, I do not care what anybody says! If you're a true Beatle fan get it. Stop complaining about the 30th Anniversary Edition, it will be worth money one day, besides it is cheaper than the regular at my local music store. As for other reviewers, I agree with eyeamthewalrus@hotmail.com. Kelly Keelly is an ignorant fruit!!! He needs to be taking some english classes, my seven year old cousin is able to write better than that! You know that fool has no musical, songwriting, productive talents. Walrus I applaud you on your put down of that nimrodic pinhead Kelly!"
5,Their Greatest Accomplishment,"As my friend says, ""Everything the Bible doesn't say, is in the White Album"". This album may have some of their worst songs but the rest is perfection. Every time I listen to it I have a new favorite, the songs grow on me or they leave and come back, Hell Helter Skelter is kind growing on me. The album has everything I could ever ask for; however, this is not my favorite Beatles album, that goes to Rubber Soul.HighlightsDear PrudenceWhile my Guitar Gently WeepsHappiness is a Warm GunWhy Don't We Do It in the Road?Julia (favorite as of this moment, so touching and beautiful)BirthdayLong Long LongRevolution 1"
5,The Beatles White Album,"Still a classic -- groundbreaking then, but still challenges musicians to stretch and try new formats."
5,The Beatles Go For Broke,"As an early Beatle fan, I had no particular plan as to which order I listened to my Beatle music...therefore the transition from Meet The Beatles to The White Album was jarring yet wondrous, and it left me clamoring to quickly gather all of the jewels in this band's legendary catalog.This album comes to life with the rocking Back In the USSR and from that point on the Beatles do not allow you to relax. They change tempos and moods with Dear Prudence, get you clapping with Ob La Di Ob La Da, and leave you scratching your head with Bungalow Bill. As the album progresses, it continues to drift into oddities like Happiness... and it culminates with Revolution #9. As a final curve ball, the syrpy Goodnight ends the masterpiece, and all you can do is stare at your stereo in stunned silence.This is a testament to the creativity and diversity of the greatest rock band of all time.This is the album that made me want to become a musician.Add this CD to your collection....now!"
4,A bit too long...but not bad...,"Okay, I was born in 1981, and no, I'm not obsessed with the Beatles. This was a good album, with some really rip-roaring songs (""The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill"" and ""Back In The USSR""), some wierd ones (""Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey"" and ""Glass Onion""), some pop masterpieces (""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" and ""Obladi Oblada""). Overall this album is good, though not all of the songs are great. ""Revolution #9"" is also superb, though the complete lack of focus on the album is not a plus. Still, it's the Beatles, and how much can you complain about that...if only all bands could sound this good without focus..."
5,AWESOME,"I'd like to say this is a truly amazing piece of work. This album is definitely the Beatles' crowning achievement. Every song is great and each song has its own distinct style. Each song has its own flavor and individuality. There are 30 totally different tunes on the same album! That kind of work can be done only by the Beatles, the best band that have ever walked on the face of the earth. This album is one of the best albums of all time, surpassed only by Revolver and The Velvet Underground and Nico."
3,Pretty Good,"Good album, but since their is so much filler that you have to skip over, I give it a 3."
2,Thanks For the Analysis,"I reached my opinion of this album a little differently. I like the 12 or 13 high quality, finished songs much better than the rest of the album. That's worth about 2 stars. And if Helter Skelter is the Beatles playing ""hard rock"" it's a good think they stayed with pop."
2,White Album,"As a reviewer below noted, ""...within these two discs reside one solid disc of tunes."" You said it. It's unfortunate that the price reflects that of two CDs."
4,Not Exactly Faithful To Original Issue,"The Beatles 'White Album' 2012 reissue.Pros:- 180g vinyl with Apple labels- Poster on uncoated paper with unedited Paul picture and lyrics on back in black text- Four Beatles pictures on heavy stock (like original release)- Band name is embossed (not printed) on cover- Gatefold (like original)Cons:- No number is stamped on front like original- Has modern copyright info printed on inside gatefold bottom- Is not top loading like original UK release- Has black inner sleeves but they have label holes in middle and clear plastic inner sleeve (original does not have plastic)It's these little details that I want faithfully duplicated. Apple, while possibly making a superior-sounding record, has dropped the ball on making a true collectable.[DW]"
5,At the Brink of Break Up-A MASTERPIECE,"This is by far my FAVORITE Beatles Album. From the exparamental ""Wild Honey Pie"" to the slow but inpowering ""Dear Prudence"" this album has it all. What a come back to rock from their album, ""Magical Mystery Tour""! It is a surprise, as break-up was in their future that they could create such a...WONDERFUL album.Personally I think this album has more of an influence on ROCK than Sgt. Pepper. With the famous solo on ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" probably explains that. Don't let the plain cover fool you, this double-album is so well-thought out. I hate it when people call it a ""self indulgent"" album. WHO CARES? It has awsome music! All in all you should buy this, REAL ROCK, album."
3,Regurgitated Beatles albums,"I jumped on the band wagon and bought the new digitally enhanced Sgt Peppers and the White Album. Two of my favorite Beatles albums. I have to say that the audio has improved over the original recordings and I have a whole new perspective as it pertains to Ringo's drumming. The drums really come out in these albums which really kick up the songs. Ringo was indeed a class act drummer however, these are the same old very tired Beatles albums that have been played over and over for the last 40 years to the point where I have become tired of hearing them. I have to give the Beatles and Co credit for re-releasing the new enhanced albums with the Rock Band game to maximize sales of both. Pure marketing genius. However, I am not buying anymore because I have the old ones and they are just fine also so I will save a few bucks and stick with those. My review is ""same old same old""."
3,White Album,"This 1968 release has some great tracks: Back in the USSR, Dear Prudence, Birthday, Revolution, Yer Blues...and others. But there are a number of reasons that it isn't a five star album, including ObLaDi, Rocky Racoon, Savoy Truffle, Bungalow Bill, Wild Honey Pie, and the one song that best describes the album - Long, Long, Long. There are 10 great songs on here, but it's one good song, then two mediocre songs throughout the album."
1,Very overatted Pop MUSIC.,"I have never understood all the fuss over the Beatles. They couldn't sing, weren't good looking and played the same guitar music over and over that you can't even dance to. Britney Spears has much more talent and is alot cuter than they ever were. One more TIME, is the greatest pop album of ALLTIME...not any overatted Beatles album."
1,Xcuse me while I retch,"Garbage! Pure, unadulterated Garbage! This is music for lame-os who sit in their libraries drinking tea and discussing philosiphy. The beatles my foot! More like the Beetles that need to be exterminated.....NOW! Now some of the Beatles albums were OK, but this.... what the hell to you mean 'The white album'? So stupid they couldn't think up a name."
1,Guns N' Roses is better,"How could anyone love this horrible album? It is really bad contains so many terrible songs especially While my guitar gently weeps. Guns N' Roses are so much better than The Beatles because they ROCK and Axl Rose can play rock and roll better.Go get 3 Guns N' Roses CDs and stay far away from this horriblealbum. Guns N' Roses were great!!!Whirligig knows music, you don't."
1,"Foreigner, Green Day,Dire Straits, GNR, and Nirvana are all much better","HAHAHA! What a joke. Who all likes awful bands in THE BEATLES, PINK FLOYD, ROLLING STONES, STEVE MILLER, BOSTON, QUEEN, and AC/DC so much? THEY ALL SUCK, And the Beatles White Album has to be one of the stupidest, dumbest CDs on the planet contains awful jokes in WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS, Each and every songespecially that one is awful. Stay far away from this and go download songs from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day, GNR, and Nirvana insted. I'm glad you can't download THE BEATLES as they suck."
1,DON'T LISTEN TO THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS THIS ALBUM IS BAD,"The Beatles are one of the most overrated bands of all time. They are overrated, lame, stupid, and lousy. Each and every song except BIRTHDAY is bad, especially the horrible WHILE MY GUITARGENTLY WEEPS. Avoid all the Beatles and get Nirvana Nevermind insted."
3,Extremely over rated,"They really really really were losing there craft by the time they came out with this self-indulgent excuse for a album.This should have been a single album rather then a double album, Want a good Beatles album. Pick up Rubber Soul or Magical Mystery Tour. I think the Digimon movie soundtrack is better. Becuse digimon is cool"
2,The Beatles White Alblum,"It brings back great memories. We landed on the moon and then Sgt. Pepper. Roomers going round that Paul was dead, That this was there last alblum. Meanwhile I learned how to the play every Beatle Song ever written, joined a Rock Band and in 1971 I visited Abbey Road."
1,Get a grip,"Come on, what's all the fuss about? There were much better bands about in the 60s than these 4 dirty looking scallys from Liverpool. It's a case of the Emperor's new clothes, me thinks. Depressing isn't the word for this dross. Then they went arty farty and gave us a white sleeved album. Thank God for Yoko Ono, she came on the scene and split up this rubbish. If only Paul McCartney would disappear like all good senior citizens should but sales of dark brown hair dye would plummet.What at load of old rot. Don't waste your money. If you're looking for good British 60s music try The Hollies. Much better and vastly under-rated."
1,All White? Not really no!!,"This album is rubbish!! It's a shame I have to give it even one star.There's not one reference to snow, paper, talcum powder, dandruff or anything else white including Xmas!!!Nope, it's all over the show, no structure to the album at all, songs all jumbled up. I think The Beatles must have still been on drugs when they put this album together. Oh Bla Di, Oh Bla Da????? Oh Bloody Hell more like.Brian Epstein died just before this album was released, and personally, I think he had some insider knowledge as to how this album sounded. This album also coincides with Oh-no making an appearance. Something which must have put them all off their stride, judging by the sounds of it!!They even had to rope in Eric Clapton to try and make it sound better, but that failed miserably.Nope, this is a rubbish album by a rubbish band. The Monkees were the original boy band, were far better and produced better songs too.The beatless have become nothing more than a brand."
5,the Best Album ever !,I enjoy the album alot I think it is right up theirwith Abby Road or Sgt peppers album
4,PROOF THAT JOHN WAS BETTER THAN PAUL!,"I was always a ""Paul person"". I defended Paul when people started using the late John Lennon as a stick to beat Paul up with. Then again ,as a young man ,I could never afford The WHite Album. I never heard it until I borrowed the library's copy. NOW I see what people mean. John contributions(Dear Prudence,Happiness is a Warm Gun,Julia,I Cant Sleep) are mostly better than Paul's(OBLA _DI,Rocky raccoon) with Some exceptions(""still"",Blackbird). On balance I would say Paul did wrote more of the best stuff OVER THE WHOLE OF THE BAND'S RUN but on The White Album (as well as""Hard Days Night"")John was puttin in the work.PS: Geoge scores with""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" ,probably one of the thre best cuts on the set."
3,An ok Album,"I'm not a real big fan of the beatles, but they are pretty good and were part of the british invasion. I'm not going to force you to buy it or tell you not to. Go find out for yourself or listen to a friend's copy. If you're looking for better music, Look to.... Led Zeppelin, Pink floyd, the who, The doors, Jimi Hendrix etc. Nothing against the beatles, but they weren't the best band back then."
2,It's all too much...,"Beatles-fans state this as one of their best. I can't agree. There are far too many bad tracks on it (John and Paul had problems putting it together. There should have been 14 songs in the beginning but they thought that there was too many good songs that they couldn't decide which to put on. So they took em all.) The main point is that we could have been without half of the songs. The strongest ones are ""while my guitar gently weeps"", ""martha my dear"", and the first revolution-song (isn't ""no.9"" the worst song ever recorded?) and ""helter skelter"". Crap. Buy ""Revolver"" and ""Rubber Soul"" instead."
4,It's good but not as great as I remembered!,"Time has a funny way of making you think certain things were SO much better than they were and The White Album is a perfect example of this. Now, don't get me wrong; I still think this album is good but not the fantastic Beatles work I once believed it to be ;("
1,THIS IS LOW QUALITY,"I AGREE WITH THE FIRST REVIEWER. I BOUGHT A COPY EXACTLY LIKE THIS (SAME OBI STRIP) ON EBAY,AND WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THE SOUND QUALITY,AFTERI HAD ALREADY GIVEN AWAY MY ORIGINAL COPY OF THE CD.NOW I AM LOOKING FOR A REAL JAPANESE VERSION OF THIS ALL TIME CLASSIC. I RECOMMEND JAPAN CD CO.ABOUT 33.00 PLUS SHIPPING,BUT AT LEAST IT'S THE REAL THING,AND I HAVE HADONLY GOOD REMASTERS FROM THIS COMPANY. FRAN"
4,not as good as the blue album,they put a bunch ogf songs on this album that were on the blue album. oh well good stuff.
1,B-side myself,"I can't believe that the Beatles had the nerve to release such a load of garbage. As a Beatles fan, it hurts me. I felt nauseaous the first time I listened to this album all the way through. There are 30 songs on the White Album. Maybe three of them are of the usual, high Beatles quality. I'm so sick and tired of bands releasing albums that aren't worthy of themselves. And the Beatles started it all with this travesty. Songs like ""Good Night"" and ""Long, Long, Long"" have no business being on anything except a b-sides album. It's shocking that they ever released this whole thing. Beatles fans shouldn't even bother to defend this album. We should stand as far back from it as possible. Oh, well. Obladi, Oblada, life goes on. But if you want a real double album, check out the Smashing Pumpkins' ""Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness."""
2,The Beatles,"I am a longtime fan of rock music, but I don't believe that the Beatles were the best rock band ever. They used to rock up through A Hard Day's Night and Help, but then went down the road of easy listening and pop.This album is OK. It has 10 good songs, which I wish were all on one CD, and I wish the other 20 songs were on a separate CD so I wouldn't have to keep skipping over them.Gems like Back in the USSR are great, but there is a lot of mediocrity here. 10 songs out of 30 = 2 stars."
1,Interesting,"I like some of the things that the Beatles tried on this album. Creative. But it just doesn't work. It's way out of line. I've got a right mind to go to the music gods about the White Album, but I don't have their number. My problems with this album are two. First, there is no hard guitar on the album. Calling Helter Skelter hard is like calling Kenny G. rock and roll. Or like saying hardcore porn is high art. It doesn't work, people! Second, I'm offended that some other reviewers would say that the state of music today is poor. As long as Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are alive, everything can't be all lost. But my point is that music was just as much dictated by the record companies in the 60s as it is now. The Beatles were a product. Some of their product was better than others. And the White Album should have made it into the rejected bin."
2,Beatles White Album,"I wanted to complete my collection of Beatles albums and I was told no collection was complete without the White Album. I was dissappointed, sounded like the Beatles were doing heavy drugs at the time of the release of this album. With the exception of a few known hits, the rest of the album is a waste. I wish I could return it for the Best of the Moody Blues! - RB"
2,Contains A Great Album,There is a great album buried within the White Album. About 12 songs should have been on this release and the rest relegated to the Anthology series.
5,Great album,"4 solo albums grudgingly packed onto one sprawling double LP. Dark? Yes, it's dark. The cover is misleading. I quite like this different, adversarial Beatles, that little bit of anger, that tension, just beneath the surface, unlike Sgt. Pepper, where they all got along and threw in every idea that they all agreed on.And so what if they were on drugs? It's great music. Naysayers, go back to your music-hospitals where you can play your sanitised substance-free music, nicely smile to your nice neighbour as you listen to The Corrs, Borrowed Heaven, and relax, safe in the knowledge that your minds wont be expanded and that this is all you will ever feel."
5,awesome beatles cd,as i have said this is one of the finest beatles cd and you will thank me after buying it i assure you.buy it.five stars.
3,A rather good self loved album,THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM. But it's definitly not the masterpiece everyone here is talking about. Coming off a somewhat dissapoing album in the form of SGT PEPPER...I expected the beatles to released something very good...but they didnt..but this is still a decent album..however...dot expect to get blown away.
5,Thanks for the speedy service!,Great album by the best band in the world! The Discs were delivered quickly and it sounds great! Thanks so much and we we will be doing business again.
3,Not as good as I remembered,"The Beatles White Album was an icon of my college days. There are some good cuts but not the whole album, it is disjointed. Better off to buy the mp3 cuts you like."
4,Water Filter,"This water filter is great. We replace it more often than every 6 months, want to make sure drinking water is safe."
5,Culligan D-40-D Level 4 Drinking Water Replacement Cartridge,I've ordered this product several times over the last several years and it's always arrived on time in perfect condition. It always performs perfectly as advertised. I'll order it here again when the need arises.
3,Water Filter,This filter seems to work as stated. I am not a chemist so I can only hope that its taking out the the bad from the water................johan
1,DO NOT BUY! Doesn't work with Culligan US-600A,"I bought this with the ""new"" improved Culligan US-600A 3/8-Inch Undersink Drinking Water Filter from Amazon because I wanted better filtration. The 600 A comes with the Culligan D-20A filter which fits perfectly with no leaks. When I installed the D-40 filter it leaked a lot and no amount of tightening could solve it. I also tried exchanging the rubber washers at the top to no avail. The D-40 and D-20 filters look to be the same size, but the D-20 has slight indentations on the bottom that allow the filter to seat properly inside the holder. It looks like the Culligan D-40 Carbon Block Filter for $31.87 could have been the correct filter, as opposed to this $27.19 filter. I don't know. I do know that I'm out about $30 and still don't have the correct filter. YUK."
5,"Great taste, no flow issues.",I installed this filter on a dedicated faucet. So I had no flow issues and the water tastes great. I decided to go with the level four because I figured it wouldn't hurt to have the extra filtration. I can't wait to see how the filter looks like when it's done. I ordered a second one so I don't run out.
4,Neat but Pricey,"Installed one of these on a sliding bathroom door as a test case. Fit and finish was perfect. Had to get more, and found it at my local hardware depot for a lower price."
5,Wonderfully Accessible,"Tice makes Schleiermacher readily accessible and very readable. An established scholar, Tice gives nuanced definitions to some of Schleiermacher's debated words, explicates the late theologian's ruminations and provides reference tools (glossary of terms, etc) to alleviate the leg work of study. I highly recommend this small but valuable book to better understand ""The Father of Modern Theology""."
3,A good book for MBAs - not for experienced professionals,I found this book to be a good summary of everything I knew after a couple of years in Private Equity. I would strongly recommend it for MBA students who are trying to enter the world of Private Equity.
4,Short But Good,"With just a few songs and amazing cover art (taken from an old comic), this Misfits release won't disappoint. It probably won't convert anyone, either, but that isn't the point. It's a classic, and it needs to be on every punk fan's shelf.Vinyl is not dead, and this proves it. It sounds just like the Misfits should, and it is one of the best vinyl releases of late (it has been re-released since its original release date)."
5,The story of King David and the Psalms for Toddlers!!!,"We've had this DVD since before Thanksgiving (found it at my local Christian bookstore), and my 18 month old daughter loves it. The puppets are wonderfully simple yet detailed, and the music is great.Jodi Benson is back for the 3rd time with her wonderfully upbeat, joyful narration that's just wonderful for toddlers and babies who understand so much, but don't communicate back very well yet!The DVD follows David from his lowly beginning as a simple shepherd, all the way through his crowning. Granted, much is glossed over, but the basic story of David' being God's beloved and David writing all those songs (Psalms!, ergo: God Made MUSIC) comes across very clearly in the show.If you want a great way to introduce the Psalms and/or King David to your little one, this is it! Clean, crystal clear, biblically based and very attention-grabbing!"
4,Worth Every Penny!,"My 7 month year old Daughter loves this video. She laughs out loud at the the funny puppets (purple is her favorite) and the still pictures of the children. She is now more observant and laughs at the large pictures of kids we see in department stores in the childrens section.My only negative comment would be not to buy this for the music. There is really only and instumental version of ""Jesus Loves Me"". We wanted more praise music but she loves it just how it is!"
2,Poor Music and Image Quality,"In general, I find the Baby Faith videos OK. However, I found God Made Music to be a weak and poorly constructed video. There are random images of cars going across the screen or sand falling in an hour glass(hardly a biblical story!) . Not really sure why the company claims to make story-based video, but my family was disappointed in the quality.I did like the bonus feature of music, but that did not make the purchase worthwhile. I will stick to other infant videos for the time being."
5,THE best study Bible.,"A friend at my Church turned me on to the Old Scofield Study Bible. I have had it for a couple months now, and I absolutely love it! It really unlocks the Scriptures, and transforms mediocre bible study habits into Spirit-filled absorption of the Word of Truth! It has even turned me back to using the KJV (I was reading the NIV before...).One thing that I don't buy in the notes is the support of the events that allegedly occured between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 (the Gap Theory). The Scriptures used to support this position are questionable for this application. Of course, no notes added to a study Bible are ever going to be infallible. Only Scripture can make that claim. Overall, this is the best study Bible available for serious study of God's Word. Just make sure that you get the OLD Scofield Study Bible (Not the New politically correct one)."
3,Nelson study bibles,not enough study notes am interested in a Nelson annodated study bible. I have a Nelson study bible now and love it but the cover needs rebinding
3,Some Gems on this CD,"I love Jeffrey Osborne. IMO he has one of the best voices out there. My fav song from this cd are:The Family (We know life isn't all magic but I'll always support your needs anytime you get nervous baby know you always got me...!!!) love itCan't Go Back on A PromiseLa Cuenta,Por Favor (My friend and I love singing this song!)"
4,Eye Opening,An excellent primer on the connection between Anthropology and Economics. I have long since passed it on to my socially aware but economically ignorant friends.
4,Great Teaching Tool,"I am a teacher of underpriviledged kids, great tool to use , the kids think its very intuitive.Way to Go Ausin Ray!Keep up the great work."
2,Disappointed,This DVD was very disappointing and I expected much more! You can find more information on Black Inventors and better sources by searching online.
4,"Correction: For 18 months & up, according to the box.","I just bought this for my daughter (14 months old). According to the box, it is for children 18 months & up, not 3 & up. This is the same for all of the My First Princess dolls, with & without the horses, carriage, etc. It also applies to the Bathtime Ariel & Bedtime Cinderella, which I purchased as well.We enjoy all of the princess dolls we bought. I feel that it's fine for her age as well."
3,"Great cover, poor book.","Stafan May IS a great photographer. This though is NOT a great book. I think another reviewer already said it, the best photo (by far) is the cover, and it's all downhill from there. Just take a look at the ""additional images"" shown here on Amazon. The remainder of the book is rarely even in the same direction as the cover. Really, it's a shame, because that cover is really a killer photo. But personally, I *hate* it when publishers do this! Great cover that bears little or no resemblance to the contents of the book. It's so deceptive and misleading, like wrapping a $100 bill around a bunch of $1's.Mr. May can do better. Take a look at some of his other books. I'd really like to give this one 2 stars, but that cover shot alone is worth the purchase price of this book, so I give it 3 stars total. Buy it for the cover and consider the rest of the book as ""filler"".DBAX"
3,"Woman are objects, face it","Does photography capture the essence of soul? Or does it deceive our perception? Or both? This book's contemptuous discernment of preposterous visual dexterity lends nothing to the exploration of feminine essence. Rather, it confounds ocular satisfaction by projecting a shallow prognosis of intergender relations, which we are offered as a proxy for reality."
3,Ok not bad,"The play wasnt bad, Allen Payne was ok, the play was too long and stretched too much but the best was Monifah and christopher williams, they were the best. Always been a fan of them both."
1,WHATEVER,"This play is lame and the videography is poor. Rent it if you can, if you can't email me and you can have my copy!"
3,Not Great but OK,This play was not great but it was ok to watch. It does flow better than a lot of the other plays in the same genre.
2,A movie would be better.,"I did not like the play as well as I liked the book. I would love to see it as a movie with Allen Payne starring in the same role as he did in the play. All in all was okay, but I do wish I had rented it before buying it."
2,Corny,"This play definitely needed better actors. I love Allen Payne, but he looked so out of place in this play."
2,A Hot Mess!,"This play was HORRIBLE!!!..I desired to see it because it was here in my city and i missed it..needless to say i fell asleep on the DVD and come to find out i did not miss anything when it came here. not sure who's play came first, but i noticed that this play was fashioned after some of Tyler Perry's stuff. two thumbs down on this one.SAVE YOUR MONEY...if someone is giving it away then view it and make sure you give it back to them...LoL my brother on the crutches was fine as wine (Christoper Williams)..you hear me? but his acting was HORRIBLE! all that falling around and laying on the floor when he asked ol girl to marry him?!?!?...What was that? Pay attention when dad goes back over Derrick's house when he rings the door bell watch how the sound effects was delayed...(UGH)"
3,Allen Payne,"I really couldn't get into this play. Christoper should have been the lead, not Allen. Allen did not seem comfortable performing on stage in front of a live audience. Rhona Bennett was awesome. This was a whole different character then the one we see on the Jamie Foxx Show. She threw down!!!!"
1,Not What I Expected,"I haven't actually made it through the whole play yet because it's so filled with cursing and sexual conversations, and I don't think I want to. I don't recommend this one for anyone. I bought it thinking is was another Christian play, but I was wrong."
5,"Brilliant collection! Mr. McFarlane, just one suggestion:","In your book, would it be better to use ""spiritual leaders"", ""religious figures"", or even ""eastern philosophers"" rather than ""mystics""?Nonetheless, what a wonderful work to remove the superstitious impression on eastern religions of people who narrow-mindedly believe in science. Thank you so much!"
4,Interesting work,This is an interesting and enjoyable read. I would have liked to have seen references for the quotes to lend it an air of higher credibility. it does provide some interesting juxtapositions of scientific concepts and their spiritual analogies.
2,"Works great with XP, Not Vista compatible","Works great with XP, took me a long time to get it working in Vista.Had to install generic drivers etc. because it is not compatible with Vista, took a long time to get it working (google)"
5,Kudos to Pledge,"Best product I have used (and this is written by someone who has used twenty or more brands). Results that provide a shiny finish that nearly reflects surrounding objects in the light are only possible on true oil finishes. Surfaces with a water-based finish will shine, but noticeably duller than oil-based finishes. Likewise, using this product on unfinished surfaces only clean it of debris; absorb it within minutes.This cleaner may vary in its results via surfaces, but if you are looking to restore your furniture's original shine, this is a sure-fire product."
5,Other uses....,"use on stainless steel, fridge, dishwasher, etc. works great and no more finger prints. Works good on wood, but I use almost only on my appliances."
1,Grease!,"I used this product on one surface, and it left it shiny and oil. Nothing I use will get rid of it and I'm really frustrated. Not even normal plegde will get rid of this oily residue."
1,FAKE PRICE COMPARISON!,"The price per ounce is shown as $.13/oz, but my calculator says it's $.64. Strange, I thought sellers had calculators, too. This error may be inadvertent: if so, it ""inadverts"" quite often on Amazon among sellers of cleaning or household products."
5,Skull vehicle lighter review,"I think this product is very good. I got it for my Dad. He lost his original one, we think somebody stole it. This new one is even better anyways though, because it seems to be brighter when it's lit up."
4,cute hummingbird,"This is a cute bird. I gave it as a Christmas gift to my sister-in-law, and she really seemed to like it. It is a little heavier than it looks in the illustrations."
4,murder mystery!,"Rob Lowe and Meg Tilly,wow! Clothing/hair is very dated but otherwise, a real nail bitter. And if you love sailing, even better. The ending will grab you. Watch for the very subtle metaphors!"
4,An Early Talent,"This is probably Lowe's best early career movie. I miss not not seeing him in more today, so it's a treat to watch some of his early stuff. Recommend rent or purchase on this one."
4,Great Romantic Movie - wait for dvd format,"This is My Favourite Lowe's movie, good story, great acting, and beautiful picture. I'm waiting for its dvd format, i don:<t know when the studio release this movie on dvd. Anyway this is a worth movie for your collection..as mine."
5,"Slick, stylish thriller","A handsome gigolo charms his way into the life of a beautiful young woman, heiress to a multi-million dollar fortune. After the loss of her mother, she lives with her self-indulgent stepfather, a ruthless cad intent on controlling both his stepdaughter's inheritance and her relationships. A local police officer also shows emotional interest in the heiress, having known her since childhood. But who can she really trust? 'Masquerade'is a dark and moody thriller, focusing on themes of money and greed, trust and betrayal. Reasonably-paced, and containing a multitude of twists and turns, 'Masquerade' is undoubtedly one of Rob Lowe's better thrillers. It is in the same vein as 'Bad Influence' and 'First Degree', with a talented supporting cast, including Meg Tilly and 'Sex and the City's' Kim Cattrall."
3,Well more like 3 and a half.,"Bad Brains is quite possibly the best punk/hardcore band ever and there are points in this early recording that indicate what they would become. There are other points, however, where the straight-ahead thrashing and chanting becomes irritating and leaves one wanting to skip ahead to the next song (even if each one only does last for two minutes). For what it is, this is an outstanding recording, a heavy duty, full speed ahead sonic assault (with the added bonus of remarkably intelligent lyrics), but those kind of album are not hard to find if you know where to look. What is hard to find is an album that combines great lyricism with the virtuoso musicianship of, say, ""I Against I""."
2,too big and floppy for a 3 month old,I've read reviews about the red not being color-fast; I wouldn't have bought it but I haven't been able to use it because its way too big and its ridiculously floppy.
3,"Would be good for an older toddler, not a newborn","I purchased this item for my 4 month old daughter. I read in one review that the brim was sturdy enough to keep it from falling down and covering the face. That may be so on a larger child but the hat is too large for my 4 month old baby's small head. I will save it for when she gets older. In the meantime, I found a much more useful hat at a cheaper price at Target. I should have shopped around."
3,Too big,This is a good hat for the sun but it makes my son look like Scarlett O'Hara. The brim is just way too big and floppy. It does cover him up but it just looks silly. I'm sure that there are other hats out there that look cute and protect form the sun at the same time.
5,Good hat,"I got this for my 1 year old son for days at the park to shield him from the son. The hat is very sturdy and of good quality. In fact, I just keep it in my diaper bag all the time because I never know when I'll need it. It's gotten wet, dirty, etc., but it still looks good and cleans very easily. It provides a lot of sun coverage and I love that it has the tie at the bottom, which is the only way I can get my son to keep it on."
3,cute. not for every baby.,"so i bought the biggest rimmed hat i could find thinking it would offer the best protection. well, unfortunately my child would not allow this to sit on his head for more than 2 seconds. the smaller rimmed hats, he could ignore. the hat is great otherwise, i just thought i would point this out to others because i had not thought of it before i bought this."
5,A great little hat,"Needing a large brim hat for summer, I purchased this item. I have been extremely pleased with it. It's adjustable so he was able to use it all summer long...and it still fits him! So, we may get two summers use from this one hat. It's truly fantastic. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Works well.,"It's nice to be able to adjust the size. My 4 mo old will have room to grow into it. Protects him from the sun and keeps the sun out of his eyes, too. Nothing extraordinary about the hat, but does what it is intended for."
2,Too floppy,"We tried this and the Flap Happy Sun Hat and ended up returning this one. The brim is too floppy, so my baby hated it.The Flap Happy hat was all around better for only about 3 bucks more: stiffer brim which stayed off her face, UPF 50+, organic cotton, made in the USA, etc. We also got the XL even though our baby is only 12 months old. The looser fit will be cooler on her head and the straps will keep it in place.I'd recommend going with the Flap Happy over this iPlay hat."
4,"Cute, but big!","As the other reviewer stated, the brim on this hat is really wide. My 4-month son is pretty big for his age, so I got the 6-18 month size and it is HUGE on him. I got a different hat listed as a 12 month at Target that was not nearly as large. I think it will be cute in a while, but definately runs large!"
5,Super cute,It's hat is super cute. My daughter lives to wear it. It seems to be made well also. We are happy with it.
2,Terrible in wind and kind of girly for a boy.,"I really wanted this hat to work. It fit my 14 month old boy just fine and offers good sun protection, but it looks like a cute ruffled girls hat and the brim flips backward in any sort of wind and offers no sun protection once that happens. It's going back."
5,iplay Brim Hat,"This is a great hat. The brim is extra wide so it provides lots of face screening. The brim is floppy so it can look a little funny, but it works great. I'm hoping that it will grow with our little guy. We'll see!"
2,baby can't see,Pros: Adjusts to fit small newborn headCons: Brim is too floppy and my baby can't see.I wound up buying another iPlay hat that looks more like a baseball cap with fabric that protects the neck and he can see when wearing that one. I did not return this one hoping it will be better when he gets bigger.
3,Fits my 3 month old,Cute brim hat. I had to give it a 3 star because of the bulkiness of the drawstring. Although it makes the fit much easier for younger infants...I cannot lay my son down in his car seat with the hat still on because the knob on the drawstring would probably leave an indentation on his fragile skull! But this is my only complaint.
4,Very Nice,"I bought 2 of these for my twins who have very different size heads ... it fits both of them and I'm sure with the adjustable back strap we will get another summer of wear out of them too! As much as I love the hats, I do hate that the chin strap is the tie kind ... I would have given 5 stars if it was a SAFER velcro option!"
2,Too big & floppy,"This hat was disappointing. After another 6-12 month hat was too small for my 8 mo old, I ordered this one, but it is too big and constantly covers my daughter's face. The brim is so floppy, it doesn't stay folded up. It's funny on her, but pretty useless as a hat."
5,perfect,the straps are great at keeping the hat on my son's head and it keeps the sun out of his eyes and off his face he wore it everywhere fromthe beach to the park its just what i was looking for
4,Great Hat,"This has been a great little hat! It is wide enough to protect our babies shoulders and arms as well as face from the sun. We have used this hiking, wading pools, and he does not pull it off like other hats."
5,Perfect Sunhat,This is a perfect little sunhat. Has a wide brim to keep the sun off ofthe baby's face and a tie to keep the hat on the baby's head.
2,Beware - color bleeds!,"Buyer beware - this hat is not color fast! I'm not sure how this company can justify manufacturing a sun hat with non-colorfast dye that will be used by children around sweat and water. The very first time my daughter wore this hat it bled all over her shirt where the brim touched it. It took me a while to realize that it was the hat that had caused it. I couldn't really believe that it would have been made so poorly but rinsed it in the sink anyway just to see. The first time I rinsed it, red colored water just flowed from it. Ridiculous that something made for children wouldn't be made color fast, especially a sun hat!Positives are that the chin tie allows it be fairly adjustable and that the brim is wide.However, the negative of the fact that I can never trust that the color won't bleed all over my daughter's clothes makes it unlikely that I will ever actually use this hat."
4,Page turner.,"I thought I might be bias to give this book a good review because I enjoy Stephen Collins as an actor but I must give it a good review based on the story itself. This was truly a fast paced, sexy, suspensful read that kept me turning the pages. The character of Joe McBride is realistic and flawed but not an idiot which makes his actions in the story plausible. A recommended read."
3,Started out great but then got boring,The beginning of this book was great and kept me interested until about half-way when it became boring and predictable.
2,Not as good as 'Eye Contact',"After reading Stephen Collins' 'Eye Contact', which I thought was fabulous, I was so excited when I finally got my hands on 'Double Exposure'. I enjoyed the book until the last 1/3, when I decided the plot was getting a bit unrealistic and silly. I also felt like Mr. Collins speed wrote the ending just to get the manuscript off to the printer!"
1,"Mindless, ridiculous, and far-fetched. A waste of time.","I guess sex sells - but only because there is nothing else of substance here. The story starts with some great sexual energy, but quickly fades with a plot that is unrealistic and characters that are hopelessly predictable. The book tries to rescue itself with a couple of unexpected twists, but the ending sags back to the predictable ... with everyone 'living happily ever after.'Don't believe the reviews of this one - it is really a case of grade inflation. Spend your time and money elsewhere."
4,Precise application of principles,"Judge Thomas Troward's work is quite powerful, and precise. He says "" Each man is the center of his own universe, and has the power, by directing his own thought, to control all things"". The work is very explicative."
2,"Fantastic material, presented poorly","The book content is great, however it is photocopied onto the larger size, simply floating in the middle of the page. Crookedly done, too. However, looking on the upside, that gives quite a lot of room to make notes if you wish to make them. Troward's work is so intense I often am underlining and making notes!"
5,A Tale For Easter,An old fashioned story with old fashioned charm. Makes you long for an era that is lost to children of this day and age. Simple and sweet.
3,The fluidity keeps it from being a true fast paced thriller.,"A cop, who is haunted by a botched hostage negotiation leaves the force to work in a small town only to be dragged back into a hostage negotiation. That is what this whole book is about.It starts out well enough, with a few criminals going into a house and holding the family as hostage in order to beat out a murder charge. While not a bad novel, the sentence structure and fluidity tend to be terse and sometimes out of place. Crais also starts adding random complications that sort of pull the book away from the unlikely but possible to the almost absurd.It's a decent book, but Crais has done so much better."
4,great story/terrible Kindle transfer,"I loved the book but was distracted on virtually every page of the Kindle version with typos, typically punctuation omissions & substitutions and breaking 2-syllable words into 2 separate words. MANY pages had multiple errors. Disappointed with the Kindle version (but would wholeheartedly recommend the book otherwise)."
4,"I Liked the book a lot but,","I didn't especially care for the way the story was told, even though I think Robert Crais is a very good writer. My favorite book was L A Requiem. I hope he uses the Elvis Cole character again."
3,Better than the movie,"This is certainly not Crais's best book.All his Elvis Cole novels--especially L.A. Requiem--are lightyears ahead.But it's not bad.And it's WAY better than the LAME Bruce Willis flick made from it.In the book, the characters are moderately interesting (Mars is more than moderately interesting), and the plot is well-explained. In the movie, much is left out, the plot barely hangs together, Mars is dull, and there are huge gaps of logic filled by explosions.If you liked the movie, get the book and read it: see how it's supposed to be done.If you didn't like the movie, get the book and read it, and you'll see how the story is actually OK.(One final note on the movie: apparently the director, an Italian, hankers to be Sergio Leone. The movie, unwisely, transforms the noirish L.A. into a cheesy Spaghetti Western with ketchup-bottle-spurting blood at every turn. If it weren't so gross, I'd laugh.)"
5,Like a Runaway Train,"This one takes off like a rocket (for both the characters and the reader) and does not come down. The characters are fascinating and I really cared about how things turned out for them in end. If you have already seen the movie, the book is still worth reading because it is significantly different, provides more details, and is much better all around. Hostage is a great read for a few evenings or a week or two of lunch hours, but don't be surprised if you have a hard time putting it down."
1,Deaver did it better,"An opening murder, psychos take hostages, parental figures incapacitated, gasoline traps, brave children fighting the odds, law enforcement not what it seems, burned-out negotiator...A Maiden's Grave is a terrific thriller; unfortunately Crais's halfhearted recycling of these elements in Hostage is not. Where is the imagination of the creator of Elvis Cole?"
3,Please bring Elvis back,"This is a fine book in the genre of a thriller. If you want a page turner it's fine. The reason I bought the book was because of what Robert Crais had brought to the Elvis Cole series. In that series the author found time for humor and, while exciting, did not force me to read more than I wanted - I'm good for a chapter before bed, I don't need to be up all night. So please bring back Elvis with his Pinnocio clock that has eyes that go back and forth and his friend Joe with his answering machine that just beeps because the message ""speak"" was too verbose. Let them sit in silence outside a house for 6 hours. I would like that far better than this action packed tale with its split second timing."
4,Hang on,"This one is a roller coaster ride with a man at the top of his game at the controls. After the first chapter your disappointment that Elvis Cole and Joe Pike aren't around will be quickly forgotten. The premise is similar to many other books and movies, but the action never stops. Need a book for Labor Day weekend? Don't take this,if you want to anything other than read, you can't put it down. Thank you Mr. Crais"
1,Disappointing,"I love Crais' work, for the most part. I rush to get the latest book, but with this one I was bummed. No story depth, flat characters, and predictable. I look forward to the next book, but may holdout for the paperback."
3,Goes nicely with sunscreen,Undemanding beach material that'll be worth the $ when it's out in paperback.
4,Hostage,"Not Crais' best work, but definitely a good read.I bought this book from ""1kwiksale."" Don't make the same mistake. The book was very far from what was advertised."
3,Bring Back Elvis,"I have been reading Crais since 'Stalking the Angel' and have enjoyed each read more than the last. Demolition Angel proved that Crais was not just a one-character author. But if 'Hostage' is the direction of future works he would be well advised to return to Cole and Pike quickly. Longtime Crais fans will surely be disappointed, and not just because this is not an Elvis Cole novel. To me, 'Hostage' is a screen play, not a novel, and a trite one at that. My advise...wait for the next Cole novel."
5,I wish I could give this book 10 stars,I was completely captivated about this tale of a hostage situation gone bad. I couldn't put this book down and felt compelled to finish it in one day. Crais fans who think they may disappointed by a non Elvis Cole book should hold on to their hats...this book takes you for a breathtaking ride you won't soon forget.Do you get the impression that I liked it?
3,Two Words - Movie Script,"With D. Lehane et al getting 6 figures+ for their scripts - ... -- can't blame the guy. I'll give it a generic ""ok."" May seem inconsistent with a 3*** rating but I liked it enough to not flip to the end, would recommend to a friend or Crais fan with caveats. Let's hope we get back to Elvis & Joe within the next year."
3,decent but movie is better,"Like the book very much, but seeing the movie six years before reading the book left me asking a lot of questions. Mainly how did the movie do such an amazing job of telling its story and the book seemed to lack in the areas that the movie excelled. I loved the character development and how each chapter and our new paragraph was the actual character and their point of view. But i was more attracted to the characters of the movie than the book. The characters seemed a little flat, as if you kept expecting more but it never came. Recommend the book, easy and fast read."
5,CRAIS AT HIS BEST - Don't miss it!,"Robert Crais used to be one of my favorite authors. After reading ""Hostage,"" he's now my all-time favorite.Nobody does it better than Crais does with this one."
3,Interest Peeked By a Movie,"I found the book to be highly engaging, this was not suprising since I found the movie (staring Bruce Willis) also to be highly entertaining. A further review comparing the two versions is upcoming. It was well-worth the read."
2,Made For TV Book,"I've enjoyed all of Robert Crais books in the past and I was anxiously awaiting this one. What a disapointment! There were no shortages in the cliche department and the ending was totally predictable given the Mafia stereotypes. The biggest surprise however, were all the favorable reviews from readers. I read to suspend disbelief, but in this case the whole story was unbelievable."
2,Made for tv novel.............,"I have read all of Robert Crais' novels and have enjoyed them all until this one which I found extremely disappointing. I think it belongs on some night this fall as the 'movie of the week'. However, I hear that Bruce Willis bought it. This means automatically that I have no interest in seeing it, if and when it comes to the 'big' screen. Too bad someone did not bother to buy some of his earlier stuff that was worthwhile seeing on the big screen or in the case of HOSTAGE, on the little screen where it belongs."
3,Good but not his usual great stuff,"It really pains me not to give a Palin travelogue 5 stars, I just find this to be the weakest of an otherwise excellent lot. So the rating is more because Sahara suffers by comparison, buy the others first and save this one for last. Perhaps because in this travel Palin is a bit more confined in the range of personalities and cultures he meets? Still good stuff, but not great."
4,Another excellent travel book from Mr Palin,"Michael Palin provides another illuminating travel book, this time dealing with his journeys in the Sahara. He travels more around the outskirts of the Sahara than through it but he still visits some very interesting places that most people don't know about. The book contains many humorous anecdotes and is told in Mr. Palin's warm, witty and engaging style. Great pictures also."
4,Delighted to discover Palin,My first book by this wonderful travel author. How has he eluded me for so long? Michael Palin is that perfect mix of an excellent observer of all that is discordant and wise and genuine combined with a fearless desire to visit places others fear to trod. Happy to have discovered this new-to-me author.
4,Sahara,"This is another brilliant account of a Palin journey. It has the usual beautifully reproduced photography and is written with Palin's wonderful sense of description and humour, although I did find this book slightly more tedious towards the end than any of his other travel books, for that reason i'd recommend his earlier books first. Saying that there is such diversity in such a relatively small part of north Africa that you are left astounded at all the different cultures and customs. A great piece of travel literature."
3,nice but,it did not fit my strat to get it to fit required a modification to the body and the pick gaurd so i just changed out the faceplate on the new one to the old one and it worked but the springs on it are really tight making it hard to whammy so i might change out the springs for the stock springs
5,Understanding doctor visits,I got this book to read to my toddler granddaughter before her first doctor visit. We discussed the instruments the doctor would use and looked at the pictures of them. We also talked about getting shots and how they would keep her from getting sick. She petended she was the doctor and used her stuffed Elmo to 'examine' before her visit. She took him with her to the doctor's office.
2,"Elmo is cute, story ill-written","Our son loves Elmo, that's why we chose some Elmo books. Good thing the cute monster is on each page because the words of the story are pathetic. The author has no idea how to write for a 2- or 3- or even 4-year-old child. The words and phrases are all wrong, and quite boring. We change the words and I try to involve my son in the pictures instead of what is written. Very disappointing. Clearly they expect the book to sell because Elmo is the main character and little care was given to writing for kids."
4,Clear and Present Danger,"FRom a white hunter to author, Peter Capstick does both so well. The world is a richer place for his having been in it. Mr Capstick is probaly laughing himself silly about the doom sayers who predict the end of the planet.Peter tells in vivid words the accounts of some of the great and not so great contests bewteen mana dn animal"
1,Snide-sighted/hindsighted,Capstick could easily have inspired J.K.Rowling's character Gildiroy Lockwood. He is so full of himself but has only a twentieth of the intelligence that he imagines. Still most of us can get by well with only a twentieth of such a grand illusion.Time and again Capstick was snide-sighted to the suffering of the victims and their families while hindsighted to skills missing in those bent on saving them.
5,You don't have yours yet?,"This is without a doubt the best CD released this year! The band members flow and their music is powerful. The rock industry is definitely about to be rocked by Illbreak with The Flood. You don't have yours yet? I've got three! Seriously, get it today- and you can't beat the price!"
1,If you want to throw your money away...,"...buy this. Utter waste of money. It arrived today and went into the garbage today. Dust and bubbles were everywhere, and my ipad looks awful. This is your standard, run of the mill cover that, unless you somehow live in a dust-free environment, will leave you with those old, familiar bubbles that happen because of dust particles being trapped underneath. Yes, the recommend using a piece of tape to remove dust, but each time I lifted it to do so, more dust seemed to appear, until I finally removed it and tossed it out. Now my iPad looks beautiful. :) Will continue to search for something that doesn't trap dust and leave bubbles... Wish I hadn't thrown out $12 or so on this. If it was $1, I still wouldn't buy it again."
3,Disappointed,"I wanted more ""brain"" moments. More one liners and sarcasm. WWE did drop the ball on this. Oh yeah, and no booklet?"
5,COMIC GENIUS!!!!!!!,I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS DAY!!!! BOBBY THE BRAIN IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE WWE LEGEND. I USED TO RECORD & WATCH THE PRIME TIME SKITS BETWEEN HIM & GORILLA MONSOON OVER & OVER AGAIN. HE WAS THE GREATEST ENTERTAINER & MANAGER IN THE BUSINESS!!!!!!!
2,Disappointment,"Wow. What a disappointment. I could not agree more with previous reviews on the poor quality of this DVD. No Booklet, No Ric Flair or Hogan commentary and no The Bobby Heenan Show. The Documentary was under an hour the extras were sparse.Won't get fooled again by WWE!"
3,A little hokey but informative nonetheless,"This is the first dream analysis book I've purchased. I guess I expected something more psychoanalytical/scientific; it's essentially spiritual/supernatural in its approach to dreams and their meanings. Nonetheless, there are some good fundamental ideas on the typical kinds of dreams and symbols and how to interpret them."
2,lost dreams,I did like the book :however I think it lacked in more information on the detail of the dream meaning. It really needed to get more in depth.
2,It was not what I expected,"I bought this book based on all the wonderful reviews that it had. Unfortunately, it is not at all what I expected. I find that the dream dictionary that this book has its very limited. To this day I have not been able to find anything there that relates to my dreams. I wish I had not purchased it, and I am really disappointed. This book has not been useful at all."
2,Left out many common words in directory ~,"I was hoping to find a book with symbols / meanings to explain several of my own dreams. Though this book rarely touched any insight to my dreams. I was disappointed with the lack of helpful words to defined my dreams. Having to analysis and try to remember more of my dreams to find a 'word', that I could look up its meaning. Upon finding a similar word to define, the meaning/definition, it was then so far off from my dream that I was frustrated and having to recall even more symbols to try and clearly define my dreams. I am going to try ""Dreamers Dictionary"", and possibly receive more insight. Also looking for: everyone has freighting dreams, in any & all aspects. I should hope to find a book to help in their definitions as well. It is never always sunshine and flowers."
5,"Finally, a loving guide to my dreams.","There are many astounding things about this book. One astounding thing is that the symbols interpreted in the book are universal. I dream something, I look it up, the explanation in the book is true. Another astounding thing about this book is that as I grow and change, I find new meanings in my dreams and the book continues to explain them. The first 50+ pages are full of excellent insights as to ""why we are here"" and what life is all about. All other dream books I've read pale in comparison to Betty Bethards's book. I've given the book to several friends, because every time I lend it out I don't get it back."
5,Tremendous Insight,"I purchased this book many years ago, when I was a regular attendee at Betty's seminars in Santa Rosa, California. If I was being COMPLETELY honest with myself when I read the meanings, her explanation of the symbols made more sense than any other book on dreams I have ever read. The interpretations rang so true, and cut through any denial I may have had about my state of being. You have to WANT to hear the message in this book in order to appreciate it."
4,Good,I have not read the whole book but it has an easy to find information layout and I appreciate that... thanks so much!
3,Bought This as a Gift...Feedback is Based on the Recipients Feedback to Me,My coworker loves studying dream imagery and messages. She keeps a personal dream log and believes that she learns about herself through dream self-analysis. She owns a few books and reads many websites. She mentioned this book one day in passing so I bought it for her as a Christmas gift. She told me that she finds it is not consistent with many well documented dream analyses and that she found it to be a little too generic and non-committal for her tastes.
1,Scammed on Volume s #3 and #4,"Have purchased I MARRIED JOAN Volumes 1, 2, 3 and now 4. Volumes 3 and 4 are ""re-runs"" of shows already on Volume 2. When hyping the new Volumes 3 and 4, the marketing didn't list the titles of the show. It is not the $5.99 that gets me -- it is the fact that the producers of these DVDs are not being honest with the consumer who truly wants alll the episodes of I MARRIED JOAN and expects NEW EPISODES on NEW NUMBERED VOLUMES -- not include all the same episodes already in previous DVDs. I have been looking for an episode I saw about Joan Davis learning to play golf. It still sticks in my mind as one of the funniest minutes of hysterical laughter and would love to own it. Have been buying these I MARRIED JOAN Volumes hoping it would show up - thanks to the company for not releasing the names of the titles on each Volume, I am just re-purchasing the same shows over and over."
1,Hard to watch a blank DVD,"The disc, though it came with both a case and a label, appears to be totally blank. I tried it in several players and PCs and all of them said the same thing. Since it's a DVD-R, you can look at the bottom and see how much has been written to, and this disc was either completely empty or totally full. I'm guessing the former.I was pretty shocked to see something like this from Amazon. Hopefully they do better vetting of their partners in the future."
1,Not a must.,"Not the best work I have seen. Basically it was the same info as the Player's handbook. TSR makes mistakes like this from time to time but I would have expect more from Blizzard. They do great work, and I am a loyal customer, but this book is below par. Blizzard should have done an independant game-testing."
5,Insightful and well written,Dr. VanHeemst raises the question of educating our children -something often overlooked or put to the side by politicians. He should be commended for his insight into the subject and compassion toward the under educated poor of the nation
1,Catnip. Oh really?,"My cat loves catnip, but she just ignores these balls. And, I don't blame her. They have a chemical smell that has not gone away after three weeks out of the bag. Now they are in the garbage.Not sure why the price is bouncing ... they were only 2 bucks when I got them."
1,Disappointing.,My cats are not interested in these. They have not played with them once. It's a shame though no big deal since they only cost a few dollars. I will stick to the soft toys with a catnip pouch inside.
3,Very Educational,I found this to be quite informative on the subject and would suggest it to persons who want to learn more about his fascinating subject.
3,okay,these are really good once you sharpen the tips which is hard because they are round i recommendwrapping the back in some thick string so it does not hurt the back of your hand when you climb and to have a file ready.
2,modifications needed,"I'm not very happy with these. First off, they are, for obvious reasons, one solid piece of metal so they are not adjustable and the strap that is comes loose quickly. Secondly, being one piece of metal, this device WILL cut into the back of your hand. And finally, the most simple thing to fix, these are not sharp enough to actually secure yourself to a tree. I have the foot spikes with these and ill just burst your bubble now that these things aren't going to work unless you make major modifications to this stuff."
2,not so great,these claws are flawed in there design. they are intended for BOTH defence and climbing but they will not work for climbing the the upward pull of the tree and your weight on the claw causes the metal back to dig viciously into the back of your hand. teribly designed.
4,good,good they work well although if you have no type of foot spikes or foot climbing wear the metal will dig into the back of your hands and will hurt and discourage any climbing
1,AWFUL,These claws do not dig into the trees. There is no grip in them. The ninja Claws just take the bark off. Also they dig into the back of your hand. DO NOT BUY
1,I wouldn't buy.,This product did not work at all. First of all there just 1 big peice of metal the has a terrible strap. When I tried to use them they are near dull and cannot grab on to trees and there are cuts all over the back of my hand from the metal that is way to loose. I wouldn't buy these unless there just for show.
2,2pc ninja hand claw climbing tigers spikes,"I train a martial art known as ninjutsu. I bought this spikes in order to train for an exam. (as well as have fun). In my opinion the actual metal part and claws are really nice. My really big problemwith this product is the quality of the wrist guard. For one the attaching the claw to the wrist and hand is really not user friendly. Secondly, it is not sturdy, after only like 2 days of barely using the claws thefabric began to tear around the part where you secure the wrist. In my opinion it is not worth buying unless you want to replace the entire fabric of the claw."
2,Poor For Climbing; Need Work,"Using these claws for the purpose of actually climbing a tree is an absolute pain, in both the figurative and literal sense. The strap that goes around the wrist is short; I am unable to secure it before putting my hand through, and have to fumble with the strap with one hand after placing it on my wrist. The ends felt very sharp, but still have trouble digging into the bark of most common-variety trees. One needs to 'hug' the tree to get a good grip with the claws. If the claws are able to hook in, any pressure applied away from the fingers causes the thick metal loop to dig into the back of your hand, quickly making it too painful to climb anything. The only things that keep this from getting a one-star in my book is that they can be climbed with, and could serve as okay hand-to-hand combat weapons."
2,Bad for business,"As a few of these guys said, they will dig into your hand but padding works as a deterrent for this. Climbing is much easier without them, I'm a freerunner, so I thought this would give me an edge, but it really hinders your performance. Although They would work well in combat, I just think they are a hassle to weild."
2,Its pretty bad.,"wasn't expecting much, but this is useless. the only reason why I gave it two stars is it could be modded enough to have some use."
1,they are not verry good,these shipped quickly right when they were supposto. The tips were extreamly dull so i decided to drasticly change the shape of the tip with a metal grinding tool they are alot better but still can barley climb anything let alone a tree/ice-wall. They have a fey pretty big design flaws. They're a big piece of mettal and were so wide that i had to were big work gloves to fit my hands and my hande are roughly three inches wide the norm is like three to fore inches the mettal on the tiger claw's are Fore and one half so they are pretty big. The wrist strap is about one third the size of the one in the picture and fall off alot. The main piece of mettal is kindof thin so it cuts the back of your hand. i was not to pleased with thease.
1,"Nice idea, Bad product",I bought these hand spikes in hopes of using them to climb trees but sadly they do not work at all. As you try to use them the back gouges into your hands and really hurts. I tried wearing gloves but that didn't work either.
3,Its OK,My friend and I got this in hopes it would help with Airsoft. I know that sounds wierd but it does help with getting away or climbing up steep edges and even trees. But you need to sharpen the claws before you intend to actually climb a tree with them. I do reccomend getting the feet claws too because those help a lot.
2,Glass is filthy dirty,"It's a good thing this scanner comes with a lot of software for fixing damaged photos, etc. You will need it to fix the artifacts introduced by the scanner itself. My unit came with lint specs and a filthy cloudy film on the INSIDE of the glass. And I'm not talking about just a little grime. I am very disappointed. I thought I was paying extra for Microtek quality.I have since noticed many other reviews for Microtek scanners with similar dirt problems.Microtek: you should be ashamed!The scanner itself is as slow as molasses, bulky, and the Microtek advertising on the lid doesn't help my room decor any.On the plus side, everything works seems to work OK and the scanner produces better results than my old HP and UMAX scanners. But I feel gyped (at least they came with clean glass). If I had bought this locally I would take it back. As it is I will either have to learn to live with it or try to take it apart to clean. Bummer."
2,?????? what were they thinking?????,"Wondered what the school board was thinking by letting this movie be filmed at their school. R-rated and nudity--I don't want to offend anyone but I was once a majorette sponsor with the band shown in this film and aside from the fact that the actresses were over high school age my girls certainly did not wear uniforms like those worn in the movie. I purchased the dvd since it was filmed at locations and with people that were familiar to me. Sorry--but I didn't like the film-- :( Also, I felt that the kids shown in the film ie: band, football players, etc would probably want to view this film since they were in it but I personally feel that it would've been inappropriate for them to view."
2,The Majorettes,"The Majorettes is an 80's horror film, so it was a must watch for me. The first fifteen minutes has alot of storylines going on so it can get confusing and seem like there is about three stories going on. The first kill was very well done, the killer favors slashing the throats of the majorettes and then baptizing them into water. It also has faint religious overtones but this film has so much going on that its hard to follow. One girl was set to inherit half a million dollars and that story gets lost in the shuffle. Overall, it can be an enjoyable film but has way too many stories going on and it can get confusing."
5,My favorite writing implement hands down,"I got my first Shaker in the early 1980's. I've never been without one since. Ever. Last time I ordered them, I bought 6 because I use them everywhere. That ought to tell you something."
5,Ditto The Longevity,"I also have used these pencils for the last 30++ years. My father, who was in the art and drafting supply business, gave me my first one. When he passed away, going thru his things, I found several more. Nice legacy, great pencils. I always carry one. Occasionally, when using another type of pencil, I will shake it before writing. I get some funny looks from people. It's habit forming. Great for sketching my engineering circuit designs."
5,GI Joe Real American Hero,Great box set. Has all the shows and the PSAs. Great for anyone who was a child of the 80s or would like their kid to see what good cartoons were like back in the day.
3,Decent set to own but costly,"It took me 3 orders for this product to be satisfied, the outer edges were damaged down the seams so I returned the first 2. I have to admit Amazon handled my transactions without any headaches and treated me like a Champ. My 3rd set came fast and looked amazing, when I opened it I noticed some damage down the sides and in the inside. I had to do some minor repairs with a glue gun to patch up the artwork in the inside and on the outside of the box. To be honest, for the money it cost I expected perfection but it's been out for awhile so I guess I can't be too picky."
5,an adorable product for my grandson!,It is so cute and my grandson loves GI Joe. The box is lke a small foot locker and there are many DVds inside.
1,WTF,What is region 777 supposed to be; God region? If these are DVD-Rs then they're probably region 0. I no idea what is up with this thing.
3,Blurred out faces in commercials!!!!!!!!,"Gonna make this to the point on how I feel about the box set.PROSNice to have the complete set of cartoonsCONS1) Dog tag is a joke! A whopping 8 page comic. They could've done a lot more but since they didn't I won't get into what they should've done2) Vintage commercials....THAT would've been cool if they hadn't BLURRED out the faces. WHY bother adding them then?I know the main purpose if the cartoons, BUT do not give us extras that are edited and a usb drive with basically nothing on it!"
4,I want subtitles,"I am G.I.Joe fan in Japan. At Japan,only 34 episode had on aired.So,I'm very grad can see all episodes with this box set.However, I cannot grasp contents because English hearing is not soproud unless English subtitles are displayed. Because I buy that oneif entering subtitles appears, I want to release entering subtitlesby all means.(Sorry for broken English)"
4,"Great collection, not so great packaging","Good points for this product: all the Sunbow episodes (minus the movie) collected, wonderful extras and great re-use of the original box art.Could be better: the disc holders are of a hard, unbendable clear plastic, with a unpractical disc connector design. In other words: it's not possible to remove the disc from the disc holder without doing some damage to the disc holder, if you don't want to bend the disc too much."
5,Too long in coming!,"At long last I can cease my search for my Holy Grail of record albums: Weeds. As a borderline hippie girl and member of a Christian commune in the early 70's, all of us blue-jean babies high-kicked to ""Witchi-Tai-To"" at midnight communions (Jesus People knew how to rock out!). That song still inspires me with its plaintive pre-amble, ""Oh my God, must it be so hard . . . I'm doin' all that I can"" seguing into a liquid bongo beat that builds and builds, then crescendos with the mantra, ""what a spirit round my head, makes me feel glad that I'm not dead."" Until now, all Brewer & Shipley re-issues had the lengthy song chopped in two or faded out prematurely. For anyone who misses an era long-gone, get this album and crank it up loud -- it's guaranteed to ""shake off your demons,"" (another great Brewer & Shipley song . . . Thanks for this long-overdue re-issue!"
5,Like the old days,"We have been looking for a digital master of this for ages. Many of these songs, particularly on the Tarkio Road portion, not only harken back to the 70's, but seem very relevant even today. A truly wonderful compilation of a duo that should get far more credit than it does."
4,Great,"Great to have this music available again...Now if only they would release ""Shake Off the Demon"" and ""Rural Space"" on CD which both had some wonderful music on them too."
1,"Great mat, but the speakers cracked","I chose this mat because of the large pieces (other mats had smaller squares and dozens of pieces-a nightmare to put together everyday) but I was dissapointed to find that the speakers cracked. When I found this product, I was so excited to find such a large mat, I overlooked the fact that it takes 14 AAA batteries. The manufacturer stated that it comes with alll 14 batteries, but mine only came with 2 for the first mat. The mat is excellent quality, but the speakers aren't. I am taking mine back after only having it 2 months."
2,"good quality, but a bit too small","it's a pretty good quality foam mat. however, it's kind of small, and there isn't any child-proof mirror like the advertisement said. It ony pronounces the alphabets if you push the dotts really hard. Besides, the paints on the dotts are easily rub off. I have to say i am a bit disappointed for spending over $50 for this."
1,There's a design on this?,"Just received my item and am extremely disappointed. This board looks as if it's been run through a dishwasher 20-25 times. It not only makes me not want to buy anything made by Talisman Designs, but it seriously makes me wonder about Amazon's quality control considering it was stocked and shipped BY Amazon. All I can say is that if there is a product that has a design that matters to you, see it in person first. Wow."
3,A Little Light on Quality but Still Heavy on Fun,"This play set seems to have never-ending pieces (believe me, they turn up all over the house). The plastic is hard and brittle so the narrow signs are easy for the little ones to snap or accidentally step on. It's hard for little ones to put together the fence too. However, in general, my son still loves this set and gets the most mileage out of it possible. Mom just wishes it'd been made slightly better."
3,These reeds work nice,"These reeds are nice for beginning and intermediate leveled players. As I said in the title: these reeds work nice. Although these reeds are not the greatest, they usually work fine, are very durable and dependable. If you are an advanced musician try Vandoren. Fast shipping and great service as always in Amazon."
3,Mediocre reeds,"These reeds are good for beginners but for a long time player i would buy something else. They're like the bud light of beers, if that helps you. They're a fine default, but they are below average quality."
5,Good for beginners,"My younger son started playing the tenor sax this year. Rico Reeds was recommended by the teacher. So far, my son has not used up the first two boxes since he started playing 5 months ago. Of course, he burned through them faster at the beginning. Good quality, no defects in any of the reeds that we have found."
2,inconsistent quality,The reeds were bought for my son who is in high school marching band. He complained that the reeds were inconsistent in that there were flaws in the wood and that they did not vibrate well and tended to squeak more than the Vandorin reeds.
2,3 months of fun,"Havent found an electroinic dart board that handles metal tip darts well as of yet. This sucks becuase they sell them like they will work for a while. If you play quite a bit, get the insurance, your going to need it."
1,"High hopes, BUT!","This tool broke so soon that I never wanted to replace it. At first the heavy cast-metal body seamed sturdy enough but it snapped into two after no more than ten uses and I'm not that strong for my 160lb. Besides it was an inconvenience the work of aligning the fish-tape into the channel for every single pull. That was in 2002. If Klein now make this tool from a single steel bar it will withstand the heavy use that it's supposed to bear, but I doubt they'll bother to correct that issue. The concept is good but the execution is poor. If you are an electrician you can try but you'll get only a nice yellow paperweight. Good luck."
3,balding princess,"Cute toy, but the hair has been falling out since day one. My 2 1/2 yr old daughter gets very frustrated and can't brush the doll's hair without ending up w/ clumps of red hair in her hands. It was a 2003 Christmas present and it probably won't last past Easter."
5,Great toy!,"This toy is great in the tub or out. She dries quick, so no worries of mold.My 20 month old plays with her all the time in the tub. She was a great buy at $..."
5,A favorite,"I bought this for my 20 month old. She really enjoys dolls, and the red hair is icing on the cake. She is soft, great for in the tub or out, and she is a serious piece of eye candy for a little girl. Very huggable and soft for sleeping with. Awesome doll that stands out in a crowd."
3,OK IN SHORT DOSES!!,"Some may say this movie is Brilliant and Some may say it's just ok, well they're both right. As long as you only watch this thing for maybe 15-20 minutes at a time. That is as long as I could take it. I actually tried to watch the whole thing, but quickly lost interest fast as it became just too monotonous and WIERD, and the novelty and brilliance of the film wore off soon. Thus I think if you watch this movie for just 15 min or so a day then it may keep interesting as there is NO STORY per se and none of the sequesnces seem to follow any kind of sequence. It actually seems like a series of wierd shorts with some common characters here and there to try and tie it all together. If you are a DIE HARD artist or appreciator of ART then you might like this film. If you are looking for a good story or something ""cute"" you are barking up the wrong wierdly shaped tree.In closing, This movie is only for the hard core!! Thanks for reading this."
5,Excellent product great price,I ordered this kit for my wifes 1996 Toyota Camry. Her clutch was just starting to slip. I installed this kit in November 2010 and so far works good. The original Toyota clutch had a better feel to it but for less than 1/2 the money Toyota wanted we can live with it. I would buy this kit again it is of good overall quality. NO Chinese parts THANK GOD..!!
5,Ken Burns Eat Your Heart Out,"Wow. Just. Wow. Is the only word to describe this powerhouse CBC documentary. I am so glad I found this series when I did! If you are a hockey fan and have any historical interest in the sport and/or the country of Canada itself whatSOever, then this boxed set is for you. I can't say enough positive things about it other than the series makes me wish I had grown up in Canada. Simply outstanding.The only negative is the publishers chose to produce the DVDs in widescreen format so if you haven't spent $$$$$$$$ on a widescreen TV, then all the images will appear vertically stretched and otherwise distorted. Bad move, CBC. Widescreen televisions are not universal just yet and probably won't be unless and until CRT screens are banned. And even then it's a big question mark. Publishing any content exclusively in a single format, especially one that is not proprietary, is always short sighted and just plain dumb."
5,Great history and fun to watch when hockey was off the air.,"This was great fun ans informative to watch during the recent lockout. I learned a lot about the game I didn't know.,"
5,Finally! I found the Fuel Injectors that I need!!!!,"If anyone is looking for these injectors, you're not going to find them anywhere else for cheaper and actually the right fit for the 86' Starion/Conquest. Having trouble finding the right 89' injectors though."
5,Great,"Durable and safety protection. That was my goal when purchasing this item. Completely satisified. Does the job, protects the hand, retains sharpness."
4,Does the job... with slipping handle,"The chisel holds a great edge when pounding through brick, block and mortar. The only issue is that the handle, which saved my hand from the 4lb sludge (Ames True Temper 1197000 4-Pound Double-Faced Sledge Hammer with 16-Inch FiberPro Handle), is sliding back to the end of the chisel. You can slam through it, but is gets pretty annoying. This problem is obviously due to the vibration and gip with each hit... haven't yet found a way to remedy this issue yet."
4,Damn good for an 80s rock album,"I'm not a great fan of rock; I prefer classical, dance, and older pop. But INITIUM is just so refreshing to listen to. There are songs about Pagan rituals; unfortunately it ain't like the real thing. But still the satire is funny and remotely scary.One drawback: this album is TOO SHORT. Even with the ""Unholy Passion"" bonus track I got, it only came to 26-or-so minutes. You'd think a band like this could put out a good quantity of music with the quality they have. There's a lot of songs they must have performed live that never made it onto any album. I'm not a Danzig fan at all but Misfits and early Samhain is just pure comical satire. Anyone with some wits can enjoy it."
3,Good but it's no Misfits album...,"This may be an unfair criticism but there are some similarities that can easily be drawn between these two bands (you all who know anything about these two bands understand.) Production is weak its a bit raw and there is something of an echo on Danzig's vocals. Sure, nearly all of the Misfits' albums were produced a bit crudely but that was part of thier sound. The drumming is crap. Seeing as I sold this album already, I can't remember if Zing or a drum machine was used. Though I remember it being bad. All the bad aside the songs are really catchy and sometimes remind me of 'Walk Among Us' era Misfits. Final verdict; stick with the Misfits and early Danzig material."
4,Interesting synopsis of Presidents' lives,"This is a very interesting book if you're wanting an overview of Presidential History. It covers the highlights of each president, but of course in about 400 pages, it's simply impossible to go very deep.The book is arranged, not in chronological order, but in descending order of each president's success in office, as judged by the author, of course. I probably would have preferred a chronological discussion, for the simple reason that it would be easier to view each biographical sketch in it's larger context.But again, overall it's a good read. I'd suggest it for anyone who is interested in American Presidential History but doesn't want to read multiple books to get the overview he wants."
3,spot sprayer,doesn't spray as was listed. sprays like a pump up sprayer. Does fit the four wheeler rack. Should have gone for the 2 gpm pump on ebay for a few dollars more.
2,Were have standards gone?,"It will spray but you will need to go over every screw and clamp, they will all be loose, even then you may have leaks, I did, use plain water for your test. The spray stream at the finest setting is wide, 11"" at 1 foot high (a little to wide for me)I will need to spray from 8"" high. a narrow stream can be had but it comes out very heavy. I needed to use a wrench and Teflon tape to stop one hose clamp from leaking, a large screw driver should have been all I needed. Also the button on top fell into the tank in three pieces, so I needed to figure out how it went together an put it back, (instruction show no button) I bought this one because of all the good reviews and it may turn out good but it started bad. UPDATE: More leaks"" I needed to use smaller hose clamps, looks like they used two sizes one correct one not."
4,Great product for the price,"This sprayer works great. The intake hose needed to be shortened in order for the optional spray bar connection to line up, and was missing two hose clamps. Otherwise, I['d buy it again!"
1,NOT a documentary. FAKE FAKE FAKE,"This movie is NOT a documentary. That's just what the distributors & cable companies want you to believe. Take away the false premise, and all you have is a disjointed, poorly scripted movie with horrible dialogue and plot holes you could drive a tank through.In my opinion, the only thing that made this movie watchable was the actual belief (not willfully suspended disbelief) that the thief was on the edge of getting caught and/or smacked down for his audacity. Without that, there's no reason to watch it. Save yourself the time & money."
5,The Hazards of Flying,Safety Last has done the most in the past several years to alert the public to the daily hazards in flying. PATCO
1,I feel ripped off here,First look at the number of reviews that are by 'AReader'I wonder who that could be.What a clever way to get a good rating.Second this is all based on incidents/accidents that happened in the sixties. No new data here at all.I feel like a chump for wasting $20 on this.
3,Mediocre 80's 'gem',"I say this is a 'gem' only because the CD is exceptionally hard to find, no longer in print, and basically available only second hand these days. In addition, the song 'Another Lover' is also hard to find these days and basically is about the only reason one would acquire this album to obtain a clean copy of that catchy song. Also, 'Into You' is a favorite of mine...both songs bring back fond memories."
1,This is a lousy toy!!!!!,"I ordered this Micro- Fly for my son. On the computer it said it worked great, but it does not. It is a very false advertisement. It takes about 7 or 8 minutes to charge, but it only last for about 1 minute at the most."
1,Keep Your Receipt,"I bought this grinder about two years ago after much research and deciding that I did not want to spend $400+ for a good quality burr grinder. Got the first one home and the timer knob did not work, took it back and got a replacement. This morning the grinder just stopped working. The Baratza website has extensive troubleshooting information. The ""just stopped grinding"" problem is the first one addressed. Just disassemble the unit, then check to see if the problem could be a loose wire, bad thermal fuse, bad power board, bad motor brush...and then use my soldering iron to fix the problem, or call to purchase replacement parts. Then ""reassemble and enjoy"". I don't own a soldering iron and I don't think I should be responsible for their lack of QC. Done with anything Baratza."
5,Powerful grinder,"I replaced my last grinder (a Breville) which I was REALLY unhappy with, with this grinder.What an amazing difference. My old grinders had trouble feeding the beans into the chamber, in fact I had to push the beans with my finger with the Breville.This grinder has so much power that it goes through beans with no trouble.It is still messy, but that seems to be the case with all grinders.This machine is definitely the best I have ever used."
4,Excellent Grinder with a few qwerks,"I have had this grinder for over a year. It provides a very uniform grind over a wide range of settings. Recently, I had to adjust the grind calibration settings back to original spec by removing the hood & adjusting one screw. Instructions are on the web site, no problem. The grinder grinds again as when new. Quibbles: 1. When turned to the maximum setting, the timer does not keep the grinder grinding long enough to produce enough coffee for a twelve cup maker. You have to turn the timer again for more coffee. 2. Like a number of burr grinders I have used, the beans occasionally hang up in the feeder so that the grinder is running but no beans are being ground. This is more likely to happen with large and/or ""candy"" finished dark roast beans. Cleaning helps but does not eliminate this problem. Turning the grind adjustment ring to the max while the grinder is running clears up the stoppage, but it is an annoying glitch. Still, produces great coffee."
1,So Frustrated.,"This grinder will not work for dark to medium dark roast beans. Period. The beans simply fail to feed into the burr grinder. Like me, if you purchase this product, you will end up looking for various items around the house to push the beans into the grinder. I've tried spoon, wooden skewer, finger, cleaning brush, and a toothbrush, all with lackluster results. Its all rather comical, until I realize that there's beans all over the floor, the stupid metal timer knob has fallen off, very little grounds, and I spent 200 bucks on this thing.It is fair to say that this has been one of the top five purchasing blunders in my life."
1,Junk,"Poor fit, poor grind, bad adjusting wheel, ill fitting bin. It looks great but that's about it. The company is responsive but that can't help a product that in the end sucks."
2,not good for dark roast beans; knob falls off constantly,I was given this grinder as a gift. I like that it is relatively quiet and that there is less dust than other grinders I've owned. But if you like dark roast beans this grinder is not for you. I've tried all the recommendations suggested by the manufacturer but to no avail. It takes several minutes of grinding using a utensil to get this grinder to produce enough ground coffee.A small irritation is the knob falls off on almost every grind. I could live with this if the machine could actually grind beans.I was shocked to learn this grinder costs $200; for this price there should be no issues with grinding dark roasts. Do all Baratza machines have this problem?I am now in the market for a replacement. Please comment of suggestions if you have time. TIA.
2,A Big Mess!,"I owned a Maestro Plus for 15 years, used it daily and loved it. When it finally decided to quit (a long slow death), I ordered the Virtuoso last summer and have been using it daily. I like most everything (speed, noise), but it spits out residue all over the counter. There seems to be no way to reduce the static electricity so you get lots of 'cling' to the hopper. Grinds also drop out of the bottom. I believe the grind quality is also inconsistent with lots of 'flakes', no matter the setting. Whatever the differences, this is not the same quality as the Maestro Plus...not even close. While I may get another Baratza product, it will NOT be the Virtuoso. In the meantime, I am buying my coffee already ground (yikes!)at the store."
5,Virtuoso coffee grinder,"If your still using a blade grinder you don't know what your missing. Even if you only make coffee with a drip coffee maker it tastes better with a consistent grind. Don't let the other reviews fool you, a blade grinder produces to much powder a makes coffee taste bitter. After you used a burr grinder you won't go back. This grinder works very good, I haven't had any beans get caught in the burrs and I have tried flavored beans with a fine setting even though I don't require fine I still wanted to try it for this review. Cleaning is easy and comes with a wire brush to clean the burrs. Static is a bit of problem but this time of year and can get pretty dry when its this cold which doesn't help but the mess is worth it. If you have the extra money you won't be disappointed with this grinder."
1,FFLLIIMMSSYY!!,"I bought this grinder about 6 months ago and have been trying to make it work properly and justify it's price ever since. The first thing to break was the instant-on button on the front, then the knob on the side slid off and never has stayed on once turned or moved, the alignment indicators for the burr are not right and so the grinding is inconsistent, and now the french press settings(35 to 40) are inoperable. I am terribly disappointed, people reviewing this item said the customer service dept. for this company was great but I have never heard back from them. Sure would like to. Last month a friend gave me the KitchenAid Pro-Line nickel grinder and it is state of the art. I'll never go near a Baratza product again."
1,Do not expect a working unit,"Hideous quality control for a very high price. Missing parts, poor packaging. Maybe it works great, but I will never find out."
2,disappointed,"This is the second Baratza grinder I have had; previous was the less expensive Maestro model which I much preferred. This one is slower, messier and I don't like the way it grinds the coffee. Should have stayed with what I had before--and saved some money."
2,Da Vinci etc. purchased from Amazon .Com,"The 2 DVD,s on the life of Leonardo are woeful. They present 'pretty' images and make assumptions on his life which are irrelavant and ,based on other intensive reading,are inaccurate.The volumes on ""The Dissenter'and ""The Scientist' both narrated by Ian Richardson are worthwhile. The remaining discs ('The Prinnce' and 'The Artist') are rambling and lack cohesion.I cannot recommend this collection."
4,Excellent capabilities but expensive,I installed about a dozen of these dimmers and companion switch pads in a large rec room / home theater. They work very well and have almost infinite programming capabilities. One word of caution is to be extremely careful not to short any output of these dimmers as it will likely destroy the unit rather than trip a breaker. Once installed properly they have worked flawlessly despite power surges and outages.
1,Problem plagued devices,"These devices have a high failure rate. I have $3753.39 invested in them for automating my home's lighting. They will stop responding to paddle presses. If you want a high end dimmer only, there are better devices that cost much less and are more reliable. If you want to automate your lighting, there are other systems that are more reliable."
4,If such a thing existed...,"This is a classy looking Elvis Presley Travel mug. I realize this is a contradiction in terms, but if such a thing existed, it would be this. I got it for my girl-friend and she likes alot. It's made out of some sort of ceramic and I don't know how hot it keeps things, but she likes it.Am guessing it's not microwave safe, given it has a gold foil looking thing. Again, got it for my girlfriend so I don't use it."
5,Incredible!,"IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE features incredible animal photography by award-winning photographer, Rachael Hale. Animal lovers will adore the pig dressed in a tutu, the cat wearing a tiara, the poodle pair lying on a bed of roses, the sleepy black kitten wearing a witch's hat...and all those puppy dog eyes.The perfect gift book to lift spirits and fill the room with ooohs and aaaahhhs all year round."
2,Unable to use it,I bought this card for my DELL AXIM X-50 and yet I was unable to made it run on the palm. Tried the drivers that came along and no success. I eventually sold it.
1,Defective,"I purchased this for our home office. The price was great, but the cable didn't work at all. We ended up purchasing another brand of cable and it worked perfectly. I recommend paying the extra money and getting a higher quality cable!"
3,The Codification of Sebastian Coe's Training,"In this book Peter Coe describes the philosophy behind his coaching of Sebastian Coe, a famous British middle distance runner. He highlights the mindset of one elite athlete/coach combination. I found this book most useful as a coach's reflections on how to develop talent and harness the luck of genetics to create a great athlete. While the principles of hard work and persistence are universal prerequisites for the accomplishment of great things, sometimes we learn that lesson best from a memoir like this.However, much of the training information is dated. For more physiologic rigor and detail look atBetter Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition,Daniels' Running Formula - 2nd Edition, orLore of Running - 4th."
2,"Interesting, but there are better.","While this book covers all of the key elements of good training and racing, there are better books available on nutrition and training strategies (especially since the book is now almost ten years old). The book focuses on Sebastian Coe and uses him as an example. This only works to a point since most people didn't end up with his genes. If you are coaching young runners (many without Sebastian Coe's body or personality) and tried to use the mental conditioning section uniformly with each runner you would lose or ruin a good share of them."
4,A good start,This is a great introduction to the type of training needed for successful middle-distance running. I stress that this is an introduction only.
3,The right night & Barry White--inseperable,"Probably one of the better records Mr. White ever cut. Not worthy of notice to general consumers, delectable to fans of the Man. Dig this: ""Sho' you right about the night and you right about us."" Man."
4,One Of Iggy's Most Underatted Albums.,"This ablum is as close Iggy has ever come to ""heavy metal"".For the price it is well worth the money. It simply rocks harder than anything Iggy has done since the 70's. Several tracks are co-written with former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones and actually sound like Jone's most current band, Neurotic Outsiders, with Iggy on vocals.A welcome addition to any Iggy collection."
4,"Yeah, At Least It Rocks . . .","This is a very underrated album by the Iguana who recovered himself after the great deal of stupidities committed in his previous album (the all-time infamous ""Blah, blah, blah"") I don't consider this music to be heavy metal at all. From my point of view is just great rock 'n' roll performed with soul and conviction, that's all. Iggy was just trying to survive, making his way in a music world ruled by blockbuster nerds such as Phil Collins or Michael Jackson. Above all, it was a reaction against the commercial concessions made in the aforementioned album. Maybe ""Instinct"" is not a masterpiece but it's a must for the fans of Iggy's solo career, as a matter of fact, it was his most aggressive and boisterous album since ""Raw Power"", enough said.Play it loud and enjoy..."
3,Not enough variety,"No doubt this is worth getting if you are either (1) an Iggy Pop fan or (2) a Steve Jones fan. I've never been a big fan of IP, but thought that maybe this was enough of a collaboration and departure that it would be worth trying. I had even read that Jones' guitar work was 'molten'. Try unmodulated and monotonous. I think Jones' work with Neurotic Outsiders or his first solo is much better."
2,"Disappointing, dated","The Sacred Sword is a wildly inconsistent book that tries to pull its trance channelling into a credible narrative. Mostly, it covers the most mundane metaphysical material - reincarnation, karma, astrology, and so on - from the standpoint of a ""trance channeler."" Perhaps its main virtue is the effort to bind the message with relatively recent developments in physics. It's well-organized and written in simple, clear prose. Frankly, you can either bellieve or not belileve in the material here (and Betty would strongly agree with that), but this material has been presented more convincingly elsewhere."
3,Get the job done.,"Bought this for my friend. He liked them. His only complaint was that the grip gets your fingers sweaty and a little sore. Other then that they are just fine, he uses them whenever he plays his guitar."
3,Very British mystery,"Enjoyable novel, but VERY British in outlook and very first person. Some parts were very abrupt in transition, and some things were left dangling. It felt like the middle of a trilogy."
1,A rising star of Elitist Conspiracy Theorists,"Heather MacDonald surely doesn't believe the silly commentary she heaps into this book. She seems obsessed with ""elitists,"" whoever they are (evidently ANYONE who disagrees with her). Her book is little more than an opportunity for ultra-conservative Americans to whine about everything they have ever found remotely incomprehensible. No attempt is made to understand these phenomema; her sole purpose is to inspire anxiety about some kind of conspiracy of elitists determined to undermine all that ""good people"" (i.e., those who agree with her ultra-conservative politics) hold dear.Seeking to inspire disdain rather than to inspire understanding, this book has no value in anyone's library. Anyone who could consider the highly-respected conservative British periodical ""The Economist"" to be ""liberal media"" has surely earned an honored place in the Not-to-Be-Taken-Seriously Hall of Fame."
5,Progressive ideology revealed for the lunacy it is.,"Thank God for MacDonald. Society would be much better off if more people, like MacDonald, were willing to bo honest about social problems. She's not afraid of being labelled a racist, just for disagreeing with cureent progressive ideals, but rather has chosen to probe deep into the heart of urban issues; as for her reward, she has found answers. Everyone should read this book, then send it to their elected officials and demand that they address the issues raised in MacDonalds essays.My only qualm with the book is that there is no bibliography. I realize that these essays were written for a journal and it is obvious that MacDonald has done extensive research, but it would have been nice to have some references."
5,Excellent!,"Since I read so much at work, it's difficult for me to get motivated to read much at home. I picked this book up and couldn't put it down. This book cannot be discounted as conservative drivel as the author has really done her homework and all of her conclusions are well-documented with citations and authorities."
3,Robbie got lost in the moon light,"The song writting and instrumental work was excellent the singing was not. Robbie sounded like a New York City drag queen I heard singing on TV once. His voice was nazel and gritty sounding also sometimes it was out of tune-a real in the shower only singing voice. If he just would have let Richard Emanuel, Rick Danko 0r Levon Helms do those vocals the songs would have had justice done to them. Sacrifice with Leonard Pletieur was by favorite as in Alabama we know what happens when you step out of line. If you can forgive most of the singing the cd is worthy of purchase. Robbie should have stayed with The Band instead of Martin Scorcesi of which I think most of his films are dark and dull and a testimony to hollywood's golden age being over. My prayer is that Robbie finds the real meaning of life which is Jesus Christ."
3,Alright. For someone who has never been to high school.,"This book gave good ideas for helping adolescents with various problems. To me, I have already been in most of the situations that are described in the book and it was boring to me. However, this book can help someone who wants to become a high school teacher. There are tips on how to get students attention and how to adress social issues in high schools. I liked the part about the girl who was bored in school and how she would not give her full attention. I was somewhat like that in high school."
4,It was Fabulous!,"As an education major, I found this book to very helpful and all and all fabulous. I reccomend it for all education majors but especially for those who are planning to teach High School. It was full of anecdote's and very easy to read. Sizer made me feel a part of what he was talking about. He really puts the problem with high school children, administration, and motivation into perspective."
3,horace's compromise,"I thought this book was very intresting. I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about teaching high school. I did not get a lot out of the book as a whole, but there were many independent points that stuck out. I liked the way the book challenged the system."
2,"Low Budget, Video",The first 20 minutes of this video was used to do a tour of Gold's Gym and to talk about about all the famous people who have trained at the Gold's Gym. The lighting was bad - it looked as though someone used a home camcorder to shoot this. I only garnered a few tips from this video. I was very disappointed with my purchase.
2,SAYING THAT MUNGO PARK DISCOVERED RIVER NIGER IS RIDICULOUS,"This book is not too bad, but it would have been better if its author and editor were frank with their ""facts"".Mungo Park, an inquisitive Scottish doctor and explorer, displayed a lot of courage in his adventures. He was steadfast and result-oriented. However, it is wrong for anybody to assume that he discovered the 'Nile of the Negroes', (as the River Niger was then called). The indigenous Africans who lived by the river banks knew its course long before Mungo Park's forefathers were born. They showed the Scot the way!Thus, claiming that Dr. Park discovered River Niger is absurd. It is as ridiculous as claiming that the first African who sailed across River Thames discovered the English river."

1,I just received 4 valve cap,"I have received just 4 valve cap and when I bought it I saw that sayed 8 valve cap, I am unhappy with this product."
3,Work,"About a work after having my car serviced I noticed the mechanic had failed to replace one of the valve caps. So, I purchased these. They are more expensive than what I could have gotten in the store, but they work great. They're made of sturdy plastic. The only downside - they are much more expensive than those you could get in the store. I have a bad hip so I don't really like walking around stores and was, therefore, willing to pay the extra cost."
4,BEWARE of the quantity of the caps! they come with 4 caps not 8!,came with 4 instead of 8! but the 8 on the name is the item# so dont be tricked! but overall its good quality!
5,is what it is,"Nothing spectacular, just decent caps at a fair price. Bought for a 2011 Grand Prix and will look here again if I need more in the future."
4,Just cool it.,"Here we have a unique album where Sammy Davis does impersonations. The impersonations are only on the first side of the album. He starts off the song as the guy who originated it and then segues into other people who had no right to sing that song, other than for comedic value. His impersonations are really good, although some of the guys he does will be unfamiliar to people in the 21st Century. Side two is Sammy singing in his own voice. These songs are swinging and enjoyable. A fun album from beginning to end."
1,A Savage DVD,"Unfortunately, this beautiful film (THE SAVAGE INNOCENTS) comes out in DVD with a non scope aspect ratio. This is a shame, particularly in the case of a director like Nicholas Ray, who used to frame his scope pictures in a very careful way. Still waiting for a scope version on DVD of this title. ADRIANO"
3,A Bright and Shiny Album,"When this album came out while I was in college, I was looking forward to something similar to ""Brother Where You Bound?"" That album was moody and Pink-Floyd like, with David Gilmour on the title track. I would recommend that album to anyone, including Pink Floyd-heads and Yes-zoners.This album is such a departure. The first half of the album has strangely upbeat pop songs. Listening to this album is like chugging orange juice. I really don't know what the point is. The second side is not much different, although ""I'm Beggin' You,"" the single off the album, had a great MTV video and catchy horn crescendo. I bought this CD reissue because I am missing that glossy, late 80's pop sound and I want to revisit my past. You decide!"
4,Best of post-Breakfast,"The problem with Supertramp is, not everyone ""gets it"" the first time. I didn't dig this record right off, and I'm a rabid Tramppist. And, the title track came off a lot better in the two live records that followed. Still, the rest of the record is very danceable and compares well to Oingo Boingo and Orchestral Manouevres In The Dark. If you want some ""new"" Supertramp, give this a try. It's really excellent."
2,Elton Tramp,"John's ""Reg Strikes Back"" sounds like this album.This album is listenable, but that is about it. It IS more listenable than ""Some Things Never Change"" but is not a CD that you will carry in the car.It is very cheerful, especially considering 'tramp's back catalog of gloom and doom. Not much like ""Brother Where You Bound"" (it predecessor) to which I can and do still listen occasionally."
2,Grow up........why????,"Imagine Paul and Ringo going out on tour, calling themselves The Beatles. Talk about outrage..........its no different here except its a lower level comparison.In Free As A Bird, I have nothing positive to say about it. This is not a release that I will remember Supertramp by.One original Band Member left for WHAT?? To go out on tour and score some Easy Money??? Let it go, I say.......unless Roger is willing to return.Don't waste your time with this release."
3,Shiny happy people.,"The 2nd post-Roger Hodgson Supertramp album positively glistens, especially in its new remastered version. The synth-soaked production was quite off-putting in 1987 becuase it was such a radical departure for the band, but in hindsight this album was if nothing else the complete antithesis of 'Brother Where You Bound', their previous, very cynical and political album. Although still for hardcore fans only, 'Free as a Bird' is an enjoyable, fun, and sparkling album from these now-ancient prog rockers."
2,What did I miss?!,"After reading everyones incredible reviews of this book, I jumped into with excitement, expecting the best... unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.The first few chapters were great - they held my attention, but I ended up slogging through the rest of the book only because I kept expecting it to get better. I understood the message of the book (God's love), but I just found the main characters pretty much unlikable, except for Ivena.I'm going to give Dekker another chance (I'm reading another one of his right now), but frankly I don't know what all of the hullabaloo is about this one."
3,Doesn't compare to Blink,"I found the beginning interesting, but after expecting more of the action seen in his book ""Blink"" found this book disappointing in the time spent developing a love relationship between the two main characters - Helen & Jen. This was written when I was half way through. After finishing it I am reducing the stars to two. The ending is weak and the type bothered me from the start - it is small and faint which makes for difficult reading. I called, asking for a version with larger type. but non existed. I have enjoyed Ted.s writing in other books but would not recommend this one unless you like to get hung up in descriptions of interpersonal relationships."
2,A Little Morbid,"This book was somewhat interesting and thought provoking but seemed to me to have a morbid theme throughout. Perhaps the author feels all believers should die as martyrs. I also found the love story too hard to swallow. Frankly, I was relieved when I finished the book ."
5,It Had Me Weeping,"OK, I enjoy a good tear-jerker every once in a while, but boy oh boy, I wasn't ready for this one!! It's definitely a ten-hanky book--that's the maximum score I'm aware of. When Jan . . . well, I don't want to give away the story, but some INCREDIBLE things happen near the end of the book. And at the start of the book. And in the middle of the book, for that matter. This may be the most incredible story of redemptive love in the history of literature. Don't, I repeat, DON'T miss out on it!"
3,Not one of Dekkers best.,"I am one of Dekker's biggest fans and am sad to say I believe, ""When Heaven Weeps"" fell short of his other works. Do not get me wrong, there are many aspects of the book that are gripping. The first one hundred pages are riveting but the book grows weaker as it progresses. The lead character sees himself as a cross between Solomon and Hosea - both desperate and loving.Its sub plot is the story of cocaine addiction and its power vs. the power of the love of a man. Dekker attempts to show the love of Christ through the trials of the characters. Dekker's attempts fall short and turn cliché."
3,"Eh, it was ok.","My review is short and sweet. My first experience with Ted Dekker was the Circle Series. I was absolutely floored by that series! This book pales in comparison. The first few chapters were gripping and I almost couldn't read it because it was so heart wrenching. The rest of the book was boring. I got the message loud and clear but I didn't care for the story. Time after time Helen left and went back to her old life but after so long, I was done and was just mad. The ending was good, that was the only saving grace for me. It wasn't horrible, just wasn't great for me. Not after reading the Circle Series. Now that is a fantastic story!!"
5,Everything You Want all in One Book,"When Heaven Weeps was the first book I read by Ted Dekker and I haven't stopped reading his books! This one is my absolute favorite on so far. It has suspense, romance, thrill, heartache, paranormal/sci-fi; everything you could ever want in a book! Dekker draws you into a close relationship with all the characters with his attention to detail and vivid descriptions. I started and finished this book within 2 days because I was completly wrapped up with everything about this book! This is a MUST read if you like Christian Thrillers!"
5,"Exciting, Gripping, Hard to put down","I really enjoyed this book. I read constantly -- Christian fiction, the classics, etc., and I found this book to be fantastic! The writing and concept of the plot was amazing. I was thoroughly surprised by the ending.I enthusiastically recommend reading this book and am planning on reading Heaven's Wager next.I hope Mr. Dekker will write many more books for our enjoyment."
4,minimalist rhythm & blues,"Very unique sound. No guitars & a female lead singer from Sri Lanka. The cut called ""Tin Drum"" will mesmerize you. For some reason I had some of this music on the same tape as Wang Chung's soundtrack work for the movie ""To Live & Die in L.A.""--it seemed to fit well together."
4,off-the-wall bongo drummin' techno funk that mesmerizes you.,"it's the vocals, gotta be the female vocals that will get your attention. this no guitar group band provides a carnival atmosphere for an upbeat blend of bongos and techno and vocals. a combination of rusted root and new order.well worth the $12.49 suggested price. particularly striking are ""big hotel"" and ""boy wonder""."
4,Hard to Find Cd Found!!,I bought this as a cassette when it first came out. i loved the heavy percussion sound with the harmonica and the sultry voice of the lead singer. To find it on CD even makes them better and the bonus tracks at the end are a nice extra.
4,Good Poundin' Fun (?),"I was stuck in the cold waiting for the bus while listening to this CD - it fit really well. These folks are pretty ticked about...well, lots of things, actually - some personal, some political. Despite the presence of at least four times as many percussionists as most rock bands, they manage to get through the whole album without becoming dull or monotonous - an achievement in itself. A smidge more melody wouldn't hurt, but my fave tracks (""Breakaway"", ""Hungry Town"") do just fine. Good album for when you're in a lousy mood and don't want to talk to anyone (oh, like that NEVER happens to you...)."
3,silk Jacquard Duvet cover,beautiful silk BUT disappointed that the cover is seamed down the middle; not what I would expect for the price.
5,Far superior to previous editions,"The 30th edition is better organized than any previous editions. The print is much clearer and the scope of the reference has been greatly increased. If you own a previous edition of this text and depend on it as I do, the 30th is a must!"
4,"""Painted Desert"" Is A Classic","Three people made this: drum machine manipulator Iuke Mori and guitarists Robert Quine and Marc Ribot. With titles like ""Mojave"" and ""Santa Ana Excursion"" you would expect evocations of the West, and you wouldn't be disappointed. The tunes are pretty simple affairs but the guitarists display beautiful tone and Iuke Mori provides the right kind of propulsion. I'd rate this a classic of '90s instrumental music, right up there with Tortoise's ""TNT"" and Peter Scherer's ""Cronologia."" In fact, in this era of gloppy vocal music and too much melisma, albums like this are probably the only thing left to enjoy. No words. Quine you may know from his stint with Lou Reed, or maybe from ""Kid With The Replacable Head,"" that great Richard Hell track from the '80s. Ribot is great too; all his albums are highly recommended."
3,ok,"This CD was okay.Maybe not worth the $16 (well that's how much I paid for it) but maybe a used or burned copy of the cd would be.My two favoraite tracks on the CD would have to be #12 and #13 (""Halloween"" and ""American Nightmare"").But it's an overall ok cd."
4,"Addictive music, man!","This album is the home to a bunch of really good songs. It doesn't matter that the lyrics are incomprehensible; you can get them off the internet or something. The only problem with this album is that the recording is horrible. You can barely even hear the drums and guitars. When I listen to it, I really do feel like I am in a ""static age"". Still, it is worth buying. Here is how I would rank the songs from best to worst: Angelf**k, Hybrid Moments, Halloween, She, Where Eagles Dare, Who Killed Marilyn?, Some Kinda Hate, TV Casualty, American Nightmare, Static Age, Spinal Remains, Come Back, Theme For A Jackal."
5,the other static age album..,"these songs where recorded during the static age sessions, these are the other versions of the songs on static age, get both."
4,Pretty Good,"This was my first misfits cd ever, and at first, i didnt like it, but after i got used to listening to it, i loved it. Hybrid moments or Static age is my favorite song. I definately would reccomend this one for any fan of the misfits."
5,The Best,"Yeah, I know that it is the outtakes but it still makes it sound cool and just makes it sound more punk rock. This is the best cd to get if you want the best songs from the misfits. Unfortunatly there are a few missing but with Where Eagles Dare and Some Kinda Hate and Hybrid Moments and so on you can't go wrong. I don't know why people dislike this one. I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it. Who Killed Marilyn is my favorite next to Where Eagles Dare and Hybrid Moments. Totally cool album, if you are new to this great band i suggest this to be your first."
4,Ektachrome Q60 Target,"Slide was askew in holder, but usable. Had to position on scanner to straighten it out a bunch of times to get it to scan squarely. The data file is a downloadable file from Kodak, and the file needed is shown on the target, as well as the web like to get the file in the documentation that comes with the target. It arrived in an envelope. No problems. My system now color profiled from scanner to printer and monitor with a Spider from datacolor. This target is for film, but can be used to profile the scanner as well. Q60 Target is for Ektachrome, and I must say now my scanned stuff looks a lot like it... scary but very good."
4,real country alternative,"I bought this CD as a fluke mainly because of the cover. TheWagoneers are a group I was not very familier with but what analbum. The key tracks to pick are ""Lie and say you love me""and another song called ""Leavin'You"". The whole album flowslike cool fresh air on a hot day. For those of you who likecountry music but complain that its maybe not traditional enoughthis is your group. Lots of steel and lots of fiddles. TheWagoneers are the real deal and their music comes highly recom-mended. 4 stars"
4,Firepower Portable Tote / VCT-0384-0990,"this product is worked good, and price is cheap to if compare with another seller for the same product."
3,Legend of the Werewolf,"I had to rent this movie at the local funky video store, the quality was not the best. But this movie is very difficult to find, so beggars can't be choosers! I would say that the movie itself is just an average horror flick, but for the performance of Peter Cushing, who raises this movie up to a much higher level. If you are a Cushing fan, this is a must see. He is clever, funny, and obnoxious all at once. A top notch performance from a man who never gave any other kind!By the way, Happy Birthday Peter Cushing, you would have been 98 today, May 26, 2011! You are missed!!"
2,By far the worst in the Benni Harper series,"This was by far the worst book so far. The story line was weak and predictable. The characters are annoying (Is Benni ever going to stand up to her grandmother who keeps ""volunteering"" her for things? Is Benni ever going to trust her husband and stop putting herself in danger with murderers and other crazed criminals? Is Hud ever going to GO AWAY!!!). The editing is terrible -- Fowler puts a whole disclaimer at the beginning of the book about how it takes place in 1996 and then has one character tell another character to ""Google it."" Um, Google was not around in 1996. It was founded in 1998 and the term ""to google something"" did not enter our vernacular until well into the next decade. Other spelling errors and typos were prevalent.I have enjoyed the books so far, but this might be the last one I read. The stories are becoming too annoying, sappy, and predictable for me!"
4,Good entry in the series,"I liked this one a lot more than the last one because it had the things I love about the series - the family, the ranch, the community. The author writes so well about these things. However, I was disappointed by the violent quality of the ending - it was not an easy read. It was also the first book in the series that I felt was heavy handed with the author's religious beliefs."
2,Too Much Dialogue,"I liked the first of her books in general but I think the writing is getting almost childish, especially the dialogue. There is too much dialogue. It distracts from the story and I believe most of the dialog in a mystery should propel the story forward and offer some clues. It is too difficult in this one for me to read through the banality in the dialogue to discover clues. I found myself skipping huge parts of the book because it was boring. And I'm also getting tired of the ""keeping things from Gabe"" story line.I read a lot of mysteries and Ms. Fowler's writing needs some toning up."
3,first Benni Harper book I have listened to...,"As I said, this is the first Earlene Fowler/Benni Harper book that I have listened to..... I really like the characters and the writing seems great, but I find myself wondering if there is a secular version of the book. I am only part way through it and have struggled to continue listening in spite of the heavy religiosity. The characters are the reason I am still listening and may try another one. Is Ms. Fowler labeled as an ""inspirational writer""? I usually avoid those...If her publisher is reading this, wouldn't it be great if you could publish two versions? One with religion and one without? : )... back to enjoying the book. I just phase my mind out when the religion seeps in.Amelia in Chicago"
2,"Trite, hackneyed, and sacchrine but reasonable plot","I listened to the audio book for Delectable Mountain from beginning to end and while it may appeal to quilters of a certain ilk... it certainly wasn't the best book I've read; not by a longshot! What kept me listening is that the plot was quite interesting.The author renders Bennie as very egotistical albeit cloaked in Christian decency. Bennie knows everything, anticipates everything, reads into everything, psychoanalyses everything, understands everything...she is cloyingly ""everything"". Detailed beyond imagination, one cannot blow one's nose without understanding the fibre of the tissue, the content of the mucus, and the use of the hand/fingers to manipulate the tissue. Ms. Earline may be a recognized author with a decent plot however, her writing could be tightened up, less verbose and certainly render her protagonist as 99% less egotistical. It was enough to make me gag."
2,No Mystery with this One,"I usually like the Benni Harper series however, I had the villian pegged from the minute he walked in the door. It was so disappointing. I have rarely and I mean rarely looked at the end of a book, but I was so sure I was right I had to look. Sure enough I was right, sorry to say. Really spoiled it for me. Hopefully the next one will be better. I realize their are mostly light reading - but I do like a little mystery a long the way. Sorry."
2,Too much religion,"I usually enjoy this series, but I am starting to dislike Benni. She is just too ""sweet"" for me. In my opinion, she loves herself. Gabe should dump her, and he's not one of my favorite people. Yes, definitely too much religion for my tastes. The writing is good, but not much of a mystery in this one either. I have really enjoy past books in the series, but it will be hard to continue when I definitely dislike the heroine."
1,"Last one I ever read, and I've read them all","As a quilter and mystery reader, I enjoyed the previous books written by Ms. Fowler, but this one is flat, too mired in her own religious beliefs and the interplay between the characters was dull at best. I missed the realness her characters usually had and it seems she traded that for the ""goodie two shoes"" attitude. I won't waste my money or my time on another of these books."
3,They are ok for the price,"Considering that the dominoes that i purchased are for my daughter and I to have a fun game at home now and then, they are perfect for what we wanted."
5,DOMINOES,recd product in great shape loved it HAVENT HAD ONE IN MANY YEARS - I MISSED HAVING MY OWN SET thanx A++++
1,...,"This is a frivolous, trivial, crummy book, devoid of substantive information. The scant data available is so generic as to be meaningless, and the tone is patronizing and dismissive. The truly useful book I found is Simone Spence's ""Deadbeats: What Responsible Parents Need To Know About Collecting Child Support,"" which is superb."
4,the facts,"The truth about the pyramids, Nazca Lines, Crystal skulls...all of the evidence is compiled here. It is a good outline of all kinds of topics that cannot be explained away by modern science."
2,Stupid,"Just some annoying guy stringing random facts together not even sure if they are facts, and horrible production value just bad"
1,Playback issue,This video can not be played on the PC. I did not see any mention of that fact when I choose to rent the video. If your playback device is a PC this is a useless service to purchase videos from.
4,November-Coming-Like Wild Fire,"This album may not be the best place to start. Although it sounds much more ""Misfits"" like. Good songs and plenty of aggression as we have become accustomed to hearing from Glenn Danzig. You can hear Glenn's ideas for Danzig starting to sprout. In my opinion, Initium is a better album but this is no weak album and it is good throughout. Dig in and enjoy!!"
4,TNA Hard Justice 2005 review,"The AJ Styles-Jeff Jarrett-NWA World title match was not great but pretty good and it could have done alot better without Tito Ortiz as guest ref. The 20 man Gauntlet for the Gold was a high-flying,hard-hitting,smash-mouth,fierce showstealer. The Raven-Sean Waltman(who was subbing for Jeff Hardy)-Clockwork Orange House of Fun match was a bloody,hardcore & a good reminder of the 1990's ECW. The rest were ok. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
3,Fix It!,"I cannot comment because I haven't seen this show yet, but these other 2 reviews on here are wrong. They are reviews of Hard Justice '06 when this DVD listing is for Hard Justice '05. Could somebody please fix this as it makes for much confusion of what is actually for sale."
5,It's not the Stones from the 1960's... and that's good!,"I have been a Stones fan since Tattoo You, therefore I love that album and enjoy the following ones except ""Dirty Work"" and maybe ""Steel Wheels"". Oh, dont get me wrong, I absolutely enjoy the classical era (Beggars-Exile on main st), but to me the clasical Stones is Tattoo You and Undercover. Therefore, I think B2B is a Great album. To the old fans, I advise not to look the sounds of Under my thumb or Ruby Tuesday in this album, because this is NOT the 60s anymore. Bridges to babylon sounds fresh and professional to me. This is not a silly teenage act. The Stones have perfected their style and they are delivering what true fans want from them. To me, Vodoo Lounge and Bridges to Babylon are two of the best Stones album and I would say they are sounding much better compared to the disastrous decade of the 80s."
1,They have finally lost it,"Oh no. I hate to say it but The Stones dynasty has finally come to an end. Voodoo Lounge was a step down the ladder, but the guys have fallen off it now. With this shocking album, you can only cringe upon hearing songs like 'flip the switch', an absolutly terrible rock track. You have to ask the question, Where has the edge gone? Where is the percussion? The backing vocals? I don't know, but those used to songs like 'Under my thumb', 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' and 'You can't always git what you want' could curl up and die upon hearing this album. Lets face it. The Stones have stopped rollin'."
2,Burning Bridges,"I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to the post-Exile Stones. However, Bridges makes Emotional Rescue sound like Beggar's Banquet. I bought this CD used but am passing it onto someone else. I thought I'd first make a tape of the songs I do like, but couldn't even find 45 minutes worth of music I'd want to keep. Why ""Baby"" and ""Saint"" were the singles is anybody's guess. There's better stuff here than that. Most disappointing is Keith Richards contributions on this CD...he has absolutely nothing to say lyrically, mumbling his way through 3 embarassing numbers. The final song ""How Can I Stop"" makes me cringe. The best numbers are the 2 ballads and the two shortest songs. I'd settle for a good 30-minute Stones CD anyday than an hour-plus of this lame stuff. Wait until you have something to say or play before your next CD, guys!"
1,WHEN WILL THIS MADNESS END?,"IT IS MIND BOGGLING TO THINK AT ONE TIME THESE GUYS WERE SECOND ONLY TO THE BEATLES IN THE CHARTS.THE BEATLES LEFT THE STAGE ON TOP AND LEFT A INCREDIBLE LEGACY THAT NO ONE WILL EVER TOUCH,HAD THESE GUYS CALLED IT A DAY AFTER 1973,THEY TOO,COULD HAVE HAD A LEGACY,BUT IT'S ALL BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THERE STRING OF LEMONS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED SINCE.THIS ONE IS NO EXEPTION! TO HERE WHAT THEY COULD DO AT ONE TIME,BUY HOT ROCKS OR ANY OTHER GREATEST HITS PACKAGE,PRE 1973. THIS IS LAME,LAME,LAME!"
2,"Trying to be hip, failing miserably","This is certainly one of the worst Stones albums ever. The utilization of hip-hop/flavor of the month producers, rap crap in the middle of songs, shows the last pathetic gasp by Mick to make the Stones contemporary circa 1997. What is the point of being contemporary, if what is contemporary SUCKS?!? With the exception of Anybody Seen My Baby, there is really nothing redeeming about this album. When I first heard it 10 years ago, it struck me as contrived and tepid. Now, I was going thru a bad patch personally at the time, so I thought I'd give it another shot. NOPE. It still smacks of desperation, and was VERY unlike the Rolling Stones I know and love. Thank god they gave up trying to be something they're not, and with their next full album of new studio material (bigger bang), delivered an album worthy of being by THE ROLLING STONES!"
1,No Lion's Share,It would be embarassing if your grandfather recorded an album of Stones music. This is what this album sounds like.
1,The rock meter has run out,"Mick, Keith and the rest hang it up NOW! I can't take anymore of this so called blues rock you think your passing over to us. People out there that think this is great Stones music must listen to the early Stones. Compare both and you will find that the Rolling Stones were great from 1964-1978. Also fella's no more LIVE albums!"
2,tank not empty yet--might as well get juiced,"A much better effort (perhaps the key word) than the airless Voodoo Lounge. Flashes of wit and, really, more polished playing than any previous album. Hopefully, the legions of session musicians are not responsible for this. Fewer truly weak songs than any album since Tattoo You, maybe even Some Girls, but without the brazen power and knowing attitude of each album before Steel Wheels. This diminishment may not be as noticeable to non-native English speakers, since this album seems to rate more highly with foreign fans. Wish I could ignore the insipidness of Always Suffering, etc. Still, a level of ambition is there, even on the Keef songs, though give Jags the credit for branching out. Some have said they can't hear the difference on the Dust Bros. cuts; they must be listening to the TV."
1,good stones? please,"I just HAD to wrtie a review of this album if only to counter these crazies who say this album has anything worthy of attention on it. Pretty much everything on this ranges from fairly bad to dismal. And I've got every stones record from '66 forward and am not one of those who feel that their only good music was before '72. I would say their last breathtakingly amazing record was Tattoo You (esp. ""side 2""), and even Undercover I would consider a great album. But this is simply boring and dismal. Believe me, you won't listen to it much at all."
1,a joke right?,"Although the Rolling Stones are, in my mind, the third greatest rock and roll band of all-time behind 1)The Beatles, and 2)The Who, their stock is crashing at an alarming rate. Let's face it, the Stones should have hung it up in 79'(if not earlier). Nothing that they've done in the 80's or 90's is good, even by today's incredibly poor standards. Bridges to Babylon is a major mistake for Mick and the boys. The cd's one hit, is written by KD Lang of all people. I can understand if the Stones want to tour and perform their great resume of hits, but I think it's blatantly obvious that they need to stop making new music, because it's forever tarnishing their great name. This cd is not at all good. There is not a single good song on the whole thing."
3,Give us another Keith solo record!,"As far as museum pieces go, the Stones are still interesting. ""Bridges to Babylon"" is a far cry from their classics, but it justifies the Stones' continued existence. There's a handful of embarrassing Mick tracks, especially ""Anybody Seen My Baby,"" and a couple of the riff rockers are punch-the-clock, rote Stones songs. But the best tracks are the last two. ""Thief in the Night"" and ""How Can I Stop,"" both written and sung by Keith, are GREAT! He's still on top of his game, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe it's time for another Keith Richards solo album."
2,Don't bother even looking at it let aloan buy it.,"This was a disgrace to me, rock fans, and the Rolling Stones reputation. First off, the songs are terrible. It doesn't even sound like the Rolling Stones I'm used to hearing. It sounds to me like they were a little short on cash and made a new disc to make a little extra money.When you think of the Rolling Stones does this CD come to mind? If it does you have probably have never listened to Let it Bleed or Sticky Fingers. In these two CD's they sound like a totaly different band. My advice is to not by this disc and instead go buy Let it Bleed or Sticky Fingers. The difference is there. So don't get a bad impression of the Rolling Stones by buying Bridges to Babylon because the Rolling Stones have done much better albams."
3,After all this time they've still got it!,The Rolling Stones are one of few groups today that still keep me interested in Rock & Roll. Saint of Me is an instant RS classic! This song & others just make you want to sing & dance!
3,Take Me To The Bridge,"Bridges To Babylon is the most recent Stones studio album and much like most of their work for the past twenty years, it is a solid, but not spectacular effort. Being that they are one of a handful of the greatest artists of all-time, they still can make great music as ""Saint Of Me"" and ""Might As Well Get Juiced"" attest to. Keith Richards in recent years has taken a more aggressive role in the lead singing department and he contributes three superb songs, ""You Don't Have To Mean It"", ""Thief In The Night"" and ""How Can I Stop"". Most of the rest of the album is plain at best."
4,They still got it,"While this was pretty harshly critiqued by many fans, I love it. It just shows you how great the minds of Mick and Keith are. Speaking of Mick, he is in great voice, his newer gruffness coming in handy on many tracks. Keith is great too, and he and Ronnie have nice guitar interactions. Charlie is, as always, a heck of a swinger. If you listen with an open mind, it's very easy to fall in love with this one."
1,Save your MONEY !!!!!!,"The Dino Cuz was an extremely enjoyable toy for my dachshund (weiner dog) however after two days of play time; the toy was completely destroyed...... The tail went first, then the feet, after that the ridges on the back and then the squeaky !!!! My dog loved it!!!! I paid $7 for the cuz and $7 for shipping for a total of $14. Not very economical for two days of fun......The hard rubber really isn't that hard. If you have a weiner dog or other dog the loves the chew, this is NOT the toy for you."
1,Beware,"After only a fews days' enjoyment of this toy, my 15# cockapoo managed to disengage a section of the foot. Needless to say, the toy is history."
3,"Weird, but fun, loony tunes","Robyn Hitchcock inhabits a wild, weird world of unbridled lyrical imagination. You can either interpret the lyrics as just so much hallucinatory silliness, or treat them as the great brush strokes of an artist painting an alternate, if highly whimsical, universe.Either way, you'll have to admit that these quirky ditties can be fun. Not everything is great here, and he has released stronger albums, but Globe Of Frogs is interesting. It also contains some good guitar work from R.E.M.'s Peter Buck."
4,"Faith, a most complex issue.","Living faith is ensconced in systems of belief. Here is more than an introduction, providing in depth, interesting writing about faiths of the living world."
4,OMG,"So here I am watching TV with my wife and the new I-POD commercial comes on and what do they play in the background but Wannabe by the Spice Girls and all of a sudden my memory is flushed with all these great times I spent when I was 13 with my friends. WE LOVED THE SPICE GIRLS....I know I know, sad isn't it...a bunch of 13 year old boys singing ""If you wannabe my lover"" is kinda weird, but we didn't think so at the time. Anyways, after seeing the commercial I had to get the cd, you know, for old times sake, and I'm glad I did...It's nice to be able to just sit and laugh because this kind of music will make you remember better, simpler times...It's great. Thank you I-POD for making me remember!"
1,"Girl Power, who are they trying to fool........","Inane Lyrics, dire backing music, stilted dance routines. Welcome to the Spice Girls.This kind of blatent commercialism is totaly trashing the music industry and should be avoided at all costs.I can understand that this music appeals to young girls and boys, but the fact is they are being exploited by fat-cat record chiefs out to make a quick buck!!!Music is about self-expression, mood, soul, life and desire... Its not about image, barmy personalities and tacky product endorsements."
5,Fun and funky!,"I'm not a closet Spice Girls fan. In fact, I'm proud of it! This was the first album and a great introduction to the Spice Girls. I'll admit, sometimes it gets a little corny with all their references to friendships...but why shouldn't they write their music about it, if that's the way they really were? This CD cheers me up whenever I'm done, all the songs are wonderfully mixed and the lyrics are smashing as an early effort! I really enjoy this debut album."
1,ONE OF THE GREATEST EXAMPLE,"One of the greatest examples of ""marketing-pop music"" of our century: this is a project, not a band. This isn't about musicians playing something: it is about machines making industrialized music with one single puposse: to get rich the fast as they can, then disappear into oblivion, before people see that they have been fooled."
1,Flashes in the pan,"Skillful marketing and risque clothing may make a commercially successful group, but take away all of that and you have a bunch of pretty pathetic, cookie-cutter dance songs. That should be enough for anyone to stay away, but throw in the fact that pre-pubescents like my 10-year-old niece are trying to emulate their sleazy, whore-like looks and slyly suggestive songs, and I have to give the big thumbs-down to this outfit. Ten years from now, someone will say to you, ""Remember the Spice Girls?,"" and you'll both have a good laugh and wonder, ""What was I thinking at the time? Good riddance!"""
5,Bring me back,"This brings me back to late elementary school when I heard half of these songs at family rollerskating nights. ""Wannabe"" was my favorite of the Spice Girls. The Spice Girls movie is pretty good as well. 1990's music with the Spice Girls. Gotta have it!"
4,Nellie's review,"the spice girls were the best band ever, but after Geri left (aka Ginger) their music SUCKED!!!!! It's too bad that I was too young to appreciate them when they were together. the best tracks on this album are Wannabe, Say You'll Be There, Mama, and Love Thing. THis is a great CD, Spiceworld is also good, but it does not even come close."
2,Spice Girls not very good,"The spice girls have the worst messages possible. The only reason I rated this album 2 stars was because there were two tracks on it that I like. ""Mama"" and ""2 become 1."" The rest is trash. Don't waste your money!!"
5,Wuz ^ peps I just wanna say SPICE GIRLS ROCK the universe!,"Yo seriosly I am the BIGGEST SPICE GIRL FAN IN THE UNIVERSE! AND BEYOND THAT! SPICE the album is the phattest CD around and has phat lyrics and good messages for todays society. like in the song 2 become 1 the line that says be a little bit wiser baby,put it on,put it on it tells you to be careful about sex,and put on a condom."
3,"It was so,so.",The cd was ok.I liked some of the songs. But if you are thinking of buying the cd I wouldn't recommend it. It's not worth it. And the Spice Girls are nasty. There always up on eachother
4,A Truly Guilty Pleasure,"I used to be embarrassed that I liked the Spice Girls, but I am no longer ashamed. Sure, deep as a puddle, but does everything have to be deep? As my sister said once, they are a happy group. You can't be depressed and listen to the Spice Girls. So take them for what they are worth and enjoy the ride. They are not the anti-Christ, they are making money doing something cheesy and fun. Why not? As for me, I love them and even my ""too cool for school"" husband is starting to come around--he just won't let me tell anyone."
5,"What can I say, it's the Spice Girls, it's gotta be great!","I've had this album for a VERY long time now, and it MUST be great, cause I still listen to it constantly! Of course, I'm a die hard Spice fan, and I do honestly think that each and every one of these songs is a SMASH HIT! They've all got catchy tunes, and belong at the Top of the Pops!!!"
3,it's an alright cd,"I like some of the songs on the cd like the first 4 songs but in my opinion i wasted $15 of my hard earned money! the song ""mama"" is almost exactly like the boyz2men song ""mama"" but still some of the songs on it are good, it's not the best cd out there."
1,To henry,"WTF? The sg are s**tty pop s**t, and they ain't even cute! The REAL hottest chick ever is...CRISTINA SCABBIA!!! She is so hot she makes the sg seem like an ugly camel's ass!! For real DM, listen to Nile, Origin, Disgorge, Cannibal Corpse, Death, Carcass, Gorguts, Crimson Thorn, Opeth, Hypocrisy, Morbid Angel, Suffocation, Brujeria, etc."
1,The group whom are irrelevant in 2007,"Blue Racer: Say bug, aren't these Spice Girls stale. Japanese Beetle: Serpent Son, they sure are. They were only popular for one year in the US which was 1997 but after Ginger left they disintegrated. Blue Racer: The rest of the girls are too old and were the creation of that j*ck-*ff who created American Idol. Japanese Beetle: Wannabe and Say You'll Be There are so 1997, this is 2006 and OUT OF DATE! AVOID OR HAASAH(karate chop) SAYONARA!"
3,Some Fun Pop,"Back when I was in 5th and 6th grade I used to love this album, as well as the Spice Girls. Now, I am a little older and don't care for this type of music as much. But, still I give this disc an occasional spin. When I do, the first 3 tracks remind me why I found this album so appealing. First off, 'Wannabe' is a fun, uptempo number, while the ballad 'When Two Become One' is an ultimate guilty pleasure. The both catchy and sexy 'Say You'll Be There' is easily the greatest song on the album equaling the work of any pop artist of the last 20 years, including more respected ones like Madonna. Unfortunately, the rest of this CD is quite forgetable. Still, I'm sure any fan of the Spice Girls or of pop music will find it enjoyable. 'Wannabe', 'When Two Become One', and 'Say You'll Be There' are all classic pop songs and make this one of the best pop albums of the 90's."
3,not as great as Spiceworld,"This album is good and danceable. my fave track is Mama.(not danceable, but oh well). Worth having in your CD collection."
4,mister kapaluko can F*** off as far as i m concerned,"MISTER KAPALUKO (OR WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS) I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MY GENERATION.I CAN NAME A LOT OF GOOD BANDS AND ALBUMS THAT CAME OUT IN THE 90s AND EVEN TO THIS DAY.TODAY'S GENERATION IS SOCIALY ACTIVE AND WE DON'T TOLERATE ""BAD"" MUSIC BUT WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT TIMES CHANGE MY FRIEND...I AM 27.I LISTEN TO ALL MUSIC AND ESPECIALLY A LOT OF JAZZ AND I STILL THINK THIS ALBUM IS A GREAT POP ALBUM...STOP COMPARING YOU C***.THIS IS OUR TIME!YOUR TIME WAS THEN.THIS IS NOW.ACCEPT IT!"
4,Still fantastic,"The Spice Girls albums have really stood the test of time. And while their debut isn't quite as good as their sophomore release ""Spice World"", it's still packed with great tracks. There are only 1 or 2 here that aren't hit material. That isn't to say they're bad. They just don't pop the way the rest of the songs here do. That's the only reason I'm giving it a 4. But even if it isn't a 5, it's still a classic that you should have in your collection if you're any kind of pop music fan."
3,The Kobayashi Report,"This is probably one of the oldest CD that I still have in my collection. It really isn't my favorite anymore, but I still think it is still pretty nice."
1,What on EARTH is ziga-zig-ah?,"Unless ""zigaziga"" is another word for throw up, I am certainly not a spice girls fan. They have no musical talent whatsover-but I give them this, their music is upbeat and bouncy, good for a workout."
5,"Very Spicy, Baby!","This debut album by the Spice Girls is one of the great pop records of all time. In all fairness, the Girls do write their own songs and all of these songs are indeed catchy and carry a positive message. In this age of teenage violence, the Spice Girls certainly deserve credit for trying to spread positivity and traditional family values to the kids in America. Together with a hit production team and visually stunning music videos, the Spice Girls show that they are here to stay, for a long long time. Check out ""Say you'll be there"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Love Thing"", ""Who do you think you are"", ""Mama"" and the now-classic ""Wannabe""."
3,The messages really are terrible!!!!,"The spice girls say GIRL POWER! But why, There songs seem to be all about guys and lovers!!It had some good points on the CD like MAMA. Then there was a rude song which I really disliked NAKED. Should little ones be hearing this song? NO WAY But they are excellent SINGERS"
4,S club 7 are better,"This cd is good but the spice girls are getting old. I prefer S club 7 myself. I like the tracks: Last time lover, love thing, wannabe and Naked. It's a great cd and all but s club 7 are newer and cooler."
1,Give me a f****ing break!,"This album is an album that belongs in the garbage. First of all their first single off the album Wannabe, what a joke! The lyrics in it are so childish and do not make any sense whatsoever, I mean come on ""if you wannabe my lover you gotta get with my friends"" Please! The song Naked, I have no freaking idea even what the point of that song is, it talks about some girl who is naked,but what else does it explain, nothing. The only promising song on this album is Say You'll Be There. Although the Spice Girls show there soft side in the song Mama, they have songs that glorify having promiscuous sex and those songs should not be the type of songs displayed in their album especially since it is targeted at such a young audience. Spice Girls have no musical talent whatsoever and should drop out of the music business, because their material isn't music at all and is and should be an embarassment to pop artists everywhere."
3,The *best* karaoke album ever!,"The Spice Girls are great, and even though they're not ""in"" anymore, (::disgusted snort::) their music started a music evoltuion. Sure, the vocals aren't the best, and lyrics are slighty trite - but really, you can't tell me whenever Wannabe came on the radio you didn't start singing along! :) This is best karaoke album (even beats Spiceworld) on the face of the planet - made by five heartfelt girls who really loved music and the notion of girl power. So it's old. So it's corny. It's kinda good, too."
3,Spicy album!,"This was nice album. This is quite old and I've get bored to this, but I remember how much I loved Spice Girls music when this album came. ""Say You'll Be There"" is greatest song of the album and the others are quite good too... But this still wasn't so good... I'm wondering why there was so big Spice Girls mania?"
3,"Sell out, but a good one","Spice Girls aren't among my faves, but this album still stands as a very convincing piece of music. Back-to-back hits at the beginning of the album show why they are so popular. They ""Wannabe"" huge."
3,"These ""Girls"" got rhythym","Give me Lee Aaron any day over the very slimmed- down Fab Five, but back in '96 it was hard to escape the sounds of ""Wannabe"" whenever you went out to a club anywhere in your local nightstrip. Songs such as ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" ,""Say You'll Be There"" and the aforementioned worldwide hit that started it all made this album the teenybopper equivalent to ""Appetite For Destruction"" with the right sort of attitude (but minus the heavy guitars, naturally...). Even the ballad ""Two Become One"" can almost move me to tears with its haunting orchestral background. ""Mama"", on the other hand, is sappy dreck. True, they helped to ruin music for the next few years with the numerous clones that followed them (I'm looking in your direction, S Club 7...), but you'd prefer Everclear over this?..."
2,"They have no talent, but not a bad pop record","The Spice Girls have not an ounce of musical talent between them, but all the same this is not a bad record as far as pop goes. Congratulations to their production team. The better songs here are 'Wannabe', 'Mama' and the ironically- titled 'Who Do You Think You Are'. The rest is the kind of corny, heartless, and overproduced music you'd expect. Their singing is just about good enough after hours in the studio doing re-takes, and they rarely try solo. Overall, not a bad pop album, and kids, who it was primarily made for, will still enjoy it after all the pathetic commercialism dies down. If you like good music, however, don't waste you're money on this audition-band. They're already millionairesses anyway."
2,"This is okay, but I've heard better","This is a pretty good CD, but the lyrics are very dry. If you like dance and pop, than try Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, or 98* I like Britany Spears, buy that cd instead! It rocks!"
4,"Good music, bad advice","Everyone admired the spice girls for their marvellous 'girl power' attitude, which frankly put the suffragette movement of the early twentieth century to shame, and nobody can deny the catchiness of their tunes. One quibble however - what's this 'zigazigah' that they are claiming women really, really want. I have no idea what a zigazigah is or how to present it to a lady. Come on girls - be more specific!. I also lost a perfectly good ladyfriend when I attempted to 'get with' her friends as they suggested. Verdict: Good music but don't take it too literally."
1,Spice Girls need mental/physical help!!!!,This was just awful. I would never reccomend ANYBODY to get this CD. It's just a bunch of people that think they can sing and everybody who's anybody knows they can't!!! It's completely horrible and could make you cry(that's how bad it is) PLEASE DON'T GET IT!!! Ick! Ick!! Ick!!!
5,Girl Power Forever!,"An awesome album!I love it!It's still one of my favorites!Hot,spicy fun!Brilliant dance tracks along with a few slow jams.Buy it today!"
3,OKAY,"Hey, ummm.I used 2 love them but now-umm-eh.If you want only want a couple songs, get the singles.The $14.95 or whatever is not worth it."
5,"I ""Wannabe"" listening to them all day!","I love The Spice Girls and if you do too, just ""Say You'll Be There"" for them as a fan. I've got a real ""Love Thing"" for all the girls. I like to play their CD's one after another so ""2 Become 1"" My ""Mama"" even likes them. You don't? Well ""Who Do You Think You Are"" Even ""If U Can't Dance"" to some of their songs, don't be a ""Last Time Lover"" and pan the whole CD. Here's ""Something Kinda Funny"", I don't think one group is half as good as the Spice Girls are and that's the ""Naked"" truth!"
1,In a word - Dumb,"The music isn't all that bad, but the lyrics are totaly stupid and don't make much sense. If you love the ""dumbing us down"" no brainer tipe of music, I highly sugest this CD."
1,Don't buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh come on, where do the Spice Girls get off throwing together an album and then making a movie. I really just can't listen to Wannabe and Spice up Your Life anymore. The songs are sugar- coated love songs with a girlpower twist. RESIST, RESIST. Protest bad music and don'y waste your money."
5,Spice Girls,"Let's take a look here:Posh Spice- Victoria AdamsScary Spice- Mel BSporty Spice- Mel CGinger Spice- GeriBaby Spice- EmmaI have 2 say, I'm quite impressed. The Spice Girls, without a doubt, is the most popular gurl-group of all time. Hey, they brought the world of pop back!!! And major style. They all wear fab clothes, especially Posh and Baby Spice.Did any of u ppl out there in the world go to a Spice Girls concert?? One where there is ALL 5 of the Spice Girls?? If so, what was it like?? Did they wear fab clothes?? And etc??? My Gawd, I >33 dem sooo much!!!!!My absolutely fave song is Wannabe, it just rox!!! And it's gream 2 jam w/ u and ur friends!!!!I almost 4got about the Spice Girls until I watched Spice World, which happens 2 b a fantastic movie, one of my actual favourites. I hope the Spice Girls reunite!! I want dem 2 sooooo baaaadd!!!!!!"
4,1996's Guilty Pleasure,"You gotta admit it. ""Wannabe"" is one of the all time catchiest pop jingles. Is it in your head right now? ""Say you'll be there"" is also very good. The remainder of teh album, while nowhere near so catchy, isn't bad. It's perfectly respectable chick pop. Gotta own it as a piece of 90s ""culture."""
5,good debut,"When I first heard them I didn't like them but then bought the cassette for my sister for her birthday and got hooked on it myself so I stole the CD from my friend and it's still hiding in my drawer 8 years later, ya'll know you were rocking to this CD in 1997, all the songs are very strong musically and melodically and it's a happy, fun, dance party album. Sure they are not the best musicians on the planet, not even close, but as a package, this is just an album of fun dance music to not be serious too, so I take it for what it is."
5,The first attempt is always the best!,"The Spice girls' first attempts at stardom start right here, with the album spice. It is a delightful look into the spunky attitudes of five normal girls. The girls expand their horizons with R&B tunes, pop tunes, and slow tunes for the heart. It is truely a wonderful album and I reccomend it whole-heartedly"
1,one of the absolute worst,"The Spice Girls are an absolute disgrace to music. There are so many other great musicians out there. Ones that can actually sing. The Spice Girls are all about performance. If they didn't have their ""nice bodies"" and their flirtatous behavior, they probably wouldn'd have gotten very far....in the music buisiness that is. All those that are agreeing with me, not to fear; so many bands, simular to the Spice Girls (simular as in getting reconition but having no talet), have come and gone thoughout the years. Since the departure of Ginger Spice (thank god) 1 down, 4 to go. Doomsday for the Spice Girls is right around the corner."
5,What we really really want,"When I was only 2 years old I got this cd and I was soo hooked I learned all of the lyrics in one day. You would love this cd if you got I just ordered a cd that has spice and spiceworld 2gether on amazon it's so fun buy this Cd!!!!!! Good Times. It was sad that geri left but remember "" Never give up on the good times it good to belive in the love you find. Nevr give it up no never give it up no"" So cool"
2,"Wonderful gimmick, I'll give them that.","No matter how hard little kiddies may try to think not, these teen pop artists from the late 90's to the early 00's were mostly all (are) fakes. The Spice Girls were put together by a record label and hired for their looks and personalities. They don't have vocal talent whatsoever, and they were the first to admit it. A writer wrote songs for them, a DJ and music group came in and recorded the beats and tracks, all they had to do was open their mouths using their incredibely weak voices and sing the lyrics, then let the vocal purifier to the rest. It worked, and the Spice Girls, along with the Backstreet Boys proved that talent was no longer needed to make money in the music industry. So remember, if theres a cute pop star that you like their looks/personality and they have catchy songs- chances are they aren't even the ones producing and developing these songs- but its a group of writers and recorders. Just a thought..."
3,Hmmmmmmm?,"I'm sorry But this album deserves at least 2.5. Come on First of all this album isn't suppsoed to be taken seriously. the reason why I give such acts Like Britney Spears or NSYNC low points is because their music is boring , bland the same terribble voices and lyrics. With the Spice girls well they are totally manufactured and yes . This is bubblegum pop. But you can't say that you didn't find it fun to listen to some of the songs on this album cause I mean Wannabe. It was a hit it topped the charts in 33 countries and yes everybody listened, even they who hated the Spice Girls. This Album isn't one of my fabourites and indeed isn't really good but when this album was released in late 1996 almost everybody were buying. This Album sold 30 milion copies worldwide and yes made real music fans throw up and little girls party. But the whole thing with the Spice Girls is such a joke that I feel indeed sorry for them so I give them 3 stars."
2,"dumb, but not unlistenable","I bought this when i was in about 4th grade. I think ever girl of that age did. I'm in high school now, and i ave to say i almost never listen to it. It's pure pop. I dont really like pop anyway, bu this is completely superficial, nonsense lyrics, and very little talent. that said, it could be worse. Mama is almost really good, and the rest are ditzy fun. However, I listened to it so much when i first got it, and ive heard it so often on the radio, that for me its been heard often enough.Basically, dont buy this unless either1) you love the Spice Girls2) Youve never heard any of the songs before3) You like totally empty, dumb popor4) you are under 10 yrs. oldsorry to all u total fans"
2,Good cd.,"Bought this for my sister who was really into the Spice Girls at the height of their fame. I've listened to it with her and there are a couple of good songs but I was in my late 20's when this came out so it was a bit past my interest level. Music and vocals are ok. If you are a SG fan, you will like this cd."
1,I hate it,I thought it was the worst album out there. The spice girls can't sing. They are just plain horrible. I hate all their songs. Protest bad music don't buy this!!!
1,It was annoying!!!,I thought this record was just too annoying to be heard by anyone. There is a lot of better stuff to listen too out there. Don't buy this!!!
3,Good Clean Spankin' Pop Fun,"This is the album that made me a Spice Girl Fan, sad to say that I was only a fan for a few months. When the album Spiceworld came out I lost all interest. This CD is better than Spiceworld and that is not a complement."
3,Silly Girl-Power Fun!,"The Spice Girls broke up years ago. I like the song, ""2 become 1,"" and ""Wannabe."" Apart from the girls' musical style which is fun, light-heartedness, and soft. Don't expect something deep in this compact disc. This collection of songs were nothing more for a young audience. You want something deep and meaningful, it's not here. It's light and maybe too light and fun to listen too. You could play this disc at parties for dancing. The Spice Girls had their fifteen minutes of fame and made a lot of money for themselves. Their careers have split in their lives. This disc is fine but don't expect much."
5,If You Wanna Hear Good Music...,"Listen to this CD! This truly marked the return of POP! The Spice Girls burst onto the scene in America with the ultra popular song ""Wannabe"". This CD went on to sell over 7 million copies in the United States alone, and over 23 million copies worldwide! This has to be one of my favorite CDs of all time. I remember listening to it while I was little (a.k.a. 10 years old), and it brings back good memories. The other excellent singles from this CD are ""Say You'll Be There"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Mama"", and ""Who Do You Think You Are?""... This CD is excellent from beginning to end. It's too bad that the Spice Girls were so short lived! This is definitely a must-have for all fans of pop. It's really really really good. Give it a chance! Highly recommended, two thumbs up! ENJOY!!!!!!!!"
5,A Pop Classic,"Five years on from its'release, the Spice Girls' SPICE not only remains a true pop classic, but is justifiably credited with ushering in the resurgence of pop music that has yielded the likes of Backstreet, Britney, and all their soundalikes. The opening salvo of 'Wannabe', 'Say You'll Be There', and '2 Become 1' still stands as one of the best one-two-three singles punches in recent memory, and if nothing here rises to the glorious level of those three, it's not for lack of trying. Both 'If U Can't Dance' and 'Who Do You Think You Are'are nearly a match for those three and of the remaining set,only the maudlin 'Mama'occasionally borders on skippable. Any true fan of unadulterated pop are committing a grievous error if they don't have this one in their collection--Britney and the like couldn't spin pop gold like this in their wildest dreams."
4,Not that bad.,I got it from some lame gradge sale. 10 tracks with total groove is enough for SPICE GIRLS. Here's what I Think.01.WANNABE-Great tune! My Score [out of 10] 9.302.SAY YOU'LL BE THERE-One of my bro's faves. 6.903.2 BECOME 1-Great love ballad. 8.604.LOVE THING-Great teack!-1005.LAST TIME LOVER-My fave. 1006.MAMA-A good song for good mothers! 8.707.WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?-The Groove is contagis-1008.SOMETHING KINDA FUNNY-Good song. 909.NAKED 910.IF U CAN'T DANCE 10
3,If you wannabe a band...,"So the songs are okay, but these girls should learn to play instruments before they call themselves a band. The songs are,(for the most part) cheery and gleeful. The songs you haven't heard,though, you may mistake for deja vu. I don't have this album (heard it one too many times elsewhere),but I wouldn't say that you shouldn't buy it. I guess it depends on taste.=)"
1,If only they could sing...,"Sorry, but I cannot get with this Spice Girl thing - they dance, they wear cute clothes...but can they make music? Not too well, I'm afraid. The insipid lyrics (""If you really bug me then I'll say goodbye"" comes to mind) and terrible singing (sing? they need to sing?) make this album a joke. God help us, soon they'll be putting out solo albums...The only reason I don't give this album a 1 is that one of them (not sure which) can carry a tune - but I'll stick with girls who really know how to sing, thanks."
5,it is cool would love to chat,i thing they should of gave it a little more thought in there music and all they in spire me to sing and all and woyuld love to met them back stage
5,Spice girls are the bestest band or singers I ever heard!,SPICE is the first album and the first album I got. It is super. I have Spice World and Goodbye. My favorite spice girls are Mel C and Emma.
4,interesting,This book has some very interesting spells. None of this book is black magic and so I like it. The thing I liked about this book was that it tells you how to come up with your very own spells.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"If you don't know much about Cliff's early career than this documentary might have some interesting information for you.But if you are a Cliff fan that is expecting to see some really great,vintage footage of Cliff in the 1950's.....pass on this DVD. There is not ONE old clip in here that is in full. All the old clips are 30 seconds long then they cut away again. The quality of the old footage is very bad as well. Very dark and cloudy looking. Really wanted to enjoy this but it's just plan bad!"
4,A great way to start the day.,"Though I found the volume slightly too large to carry around as a true paperback, the 5 Minute New Testament is a great book for keeping on the nightstand and getting your day off to a spiritually healthy start. There is an excellent ""introduction"" that highlights the methods used in translating the New testament and a list of scholarly contributors. There is also a subject index and a brief introduction to the passage of the day. Following each of the 365 passages, there is a short question or statement that is meant to provoke thought. Alternative meanings to words or passages are also noted. A very readable, clear and clean text."
5,Love this book!,This book has great ideas on how to use phonics in the classroom. It gave me a fresh perspective on how to use different phonic activities in my classroom. I was able to create different centers or stations during my literacy block.
5,Class Requirement,This book is a wonderful tool for anyone who is a teacher or hopes to become one. It has great ideas clearly stated and easy to read and follow. These activities are adaptable to children of all ages. This book was a requirement for a class but I am glad to own it and will keep it for reference.
3,so-so,"The book I recently received came very quickly, but I thought the condition was worse than the description said. The book was pretty disgusting and I felt dirty picking it up. It was sticky and pretty beat up."
1,Phonics = Barking at Print,"I would recommend this for anyone interested in teaching Phonics. However, if you are interested helping children become proficient readers I would suggest you purchase Frank Smiths' ""Understanding Reading""."
1,horrible,"absolutely horrible. it won't clamp on right, it gets scratched up really easily and cracks in your pocket!!! HORRIBLE!"
5,A MUST READ CLASSIC,"The Judas Contract is the pinnacle of the Wolfman-Perez era of the Titans, thats all there is to it. Action, adventure, betrayal, and tragedy are all enveloped within some of Perez's greatest work ever. I would recommend this not just to any Titans fan, but any comics fan at all, and you couldnt ask for a better introduction to the Titans if you've never been a fan. If you didnt like The Judas Contract, you just dont ""get it"" and never will. Its easily one of the Top 20, maybe Top 10 stories ever told. Forget Crisis, Identity Crisis, and Avengers Disassembled, if you want an ""epic"" story arc or an ""event"", this is it."
4,Good item - but overpriced.,"This is a great book, but there are very few pages and it is a bit pricey."
4,not as good as other books in this series,"This book is written in quite a different format then the other books in this series. It is not as well written as the others. However, I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to have closure in this series, and for anyone who wants to know a little more about Caroline Ingalls's early life."
4,Misfits are awesome live,"If you love the Misfits there's no doubt that Evilive is worth buying. Even though the old Misfits aren't about to play together anytime soon, this CD gives you a little taste of the energy at a Misfits show. However, the sound quality is so poor on some tracks that it can be distracting, but after a while you get used to it. This CD is good, but there's definately room for improvement. If your a mega Misfits fan don't hesitate to buy it, but if your only looking to get your first Misfits CD get one of their other albums."
2,Tape Version Was Better,"Is it just me, or does this CD sound horrible in comparison to the release on actual audio tape? It sounds very tinny on CD. Furthermore, they removed the most interesting, hilarious track, the one where Danzig improvs his ""Bobby Steele's an a-hole"" lyrics during Teenagers from Mars. That was half the reason I bought this, and was very annoyed to find it missing."
2,Killed by the sound quality.,"I appreciate that the Misfits' production has always been lower-quality because it was DIY and that's part of their charm. However, with the exception of being able to experience how ferocious they were live (this includes Glenn jawing to audience members between songs), the songs on the album are probably better enjoyed on their studio releases.Recommended for established Misfits fans only; I would recommend new Misfits fans check out either Walk Among Us, Earth AD, or the first Collection album."
5,The Coolest Band On Earth!!!!!!!,"The Misfits are quite simply the coolest band on earth!!! The Misfits live were what shows should be about, fast, fun, and absolutely full of energy. This live cd is great, the sound quality is not very good, but that is not nearly enough to make this a less-than-amazing album. I wish it could've had some more tracks on it, but they put some of the best Misfits material on here. As well as, some less-known songs like Ghouls Night Out, and Horror Hotel. Highlights of the album are: Astro Zombies, Ghouls Night Out, Night of the Living Dead, All Hell Breaks Loose, We Are 138, and the best of all Horror Business. Overall this album is just incredibly fast and fun. This album is a MUST HAVE for any true Misfits fan."
3,This one could have been much better.,"After hearing ""London Dungon"" on a skateboard video, I set out to buy my first(of four) Misfits CD. This was the only Cd that I could find with ""London Dungon"". To bad I didn't see their self-titled album. Any way I popped it in the stereo and was shocked by the poor sound quality. Danzig's voice could be barly heard half the time and kept fading out. Another awsome song"" Horror Buisness"" was also marred by poor sound. In fact all the song on here sound bad. The best part of the CD is hearing them talk between and after some songs. This CD is not bad, it just isn't great. If you are looking for somthing new you should pick this baby up."
2,only buy this if you're a misfits fanatic,"This cd has pretty much all their great songs, but be warned. The sound quality is beyond awful. If you're hearing any of the songs on this for the first time, you might end up being biased, as the real recordings of these songs sound much better. For misifts newcomers, i'd reccommend ""misfits collection 1"". Then maybe collection 2."
2,Good for die hard fans,"Probably the only way you'll get to hear the misfits live but the sound quality is horrible. I've heard live bootleg Misfits records with better quality. This isn't to say that the band played poorly, but it can be a bit of a downer if you think your going to get blown away by the Misfits playing live. Not a record to start your Misfits collection off with but still a good listen if your into the Misfits."
2,"I guess I just don't ""get it""...","...if ""getting it"" means not feeling ripped off paying $17 for this short, sloppy and screechy set. Sure, it's ""as close as we're going to get to being there"" but I still think the people there were having more fun than anyone listening to this CD will.At least it's cheaper than the bootlegs."
1,I payed too much for this!,"wow this album has HORRIBLE sound quality! Some of it is sort of listenable but some tracks,but some are down right terrible! especially Night Of The Living Dead, Astro Zombies! There are a couple of okay ones near the end. If you want these songs you can find them on albums that have a much better sound such as MISFITS COLLECTION 1 & 2 and WALK AMONG US. If you are one of those people who just has to own everything a band releases then I guess it is sort of worth having for its pretty rainbow cover!hehe"
4,As close to being in person as you can get,"Despite it's sound quality, ""Evilive"" is as close as anyone can get today to seeing the Danzig-era Misfits live. As just about everyone knows, this disc comes close to sounding like an import bootleg, but if you can get past that you'll get a sample of the surprisingly awesome power and energy of what a Misfits show was like back in their heyday. ""Astro Zombies"", ""Horror Business"", and ""We Are 138"" (with Henry Rollins!!!) were meant to be played live, although ""Last Caress"", ""Die, Die My Darling"", ""Halloween"", ""She"", and ""Bullet"" would have been more than welcome here as well. That aside, this is still worth picking up for all Misfits fans, although newcomers are better left starting off with either ""Collection"" album or ""Static Age""."
1,NOT something I can recommend...,"a book that required gritted-teeth to complete.If you were expecting a Dava Sobel style (Longitude) book of fascinating insight and drama, you will be deeply disappointed.The author wanders randomly through 17th century gardening, seemingly without direction or interest.If you expected to see HOW Mr Fairchild did things, you won't get it. If you expected explanations on the methods used, you won't get it. If you expected even rudimentary paragraphs on the sex organs of plants or a light-weight explanation of SAP flow, once again, you won't find it. If you wanted endless vague descriptions of people long dead, then this book is for you.The final few pages top of an execrable book by being blatently pro-GM, despite most intelligent people having grave misgivings on the directions being taken.I cannot recommend the book unless you already have a detailed knowledge of gardening and 17th century Britain. But then you don't need this book either."
3,Lots of uses...,"but not really a good for covering baby. I regeistered for these based on the name. After I opened them I realized they aren't very big, they're thin, and after a few washes looked cheap. We ended up using them first rolled up in our carrier seat to keep our 4 lb. preemie in place, then as a top sheet in his bed. I now use them as changing pads or play mats while I'm away from home.I would recommend Carter's receiving blankets because are a little bigger and heavier and held up better after washing."
2,"Slightly useful, but not as a blanket","This blanket set has 1 yellow, 2 green, and 2 white blankets with a very faint print- very disappointing that it pretty much looks white. I only saw them online and thought they would be useful. Although it says they are great for swaddling, don't be fooled- they are hardly big enough or heavy enough to keep a fussy baby snug. They are also extremely lightweight, which I suppose is fine if it is really warm and you just need to keep drafts off the baby. But, that also means they fold up very compact and fit easily in the smallest diaper bag. After 2 months, I have found that I use these blankets as ""sneeze guards"" over the car seat while shopping, rolled up to help support baby's head in the car seat, and for privacy while nursing. Bottom line is that if you are looking for a blanket to keep the baby warm, or something that looks cute, look elsewhere. But, for $10 you, too, will probably find random uses for these."
5,Baby's favorite blankie,"These are my one year old daughters favorite blankets she won't go to sleep without at least one of them.(sometimes she likes to sleep with two) They are good for a spring/summer baby as they are lighter than some of the others that I have. They're just big enough to swaddle a newborn. I didn't swaddle my daughter for very long as she was born in May and it gets hot in Virginia in May. She would break out in a heat rash if I swaddled her. The blankets have worn well and I've washed them a lot. On average 2 to 3 times a week. The colored ones have not faded at all. The 2 with the design are faint to begin with they look almost white but there is a cute design on them and they haven't faded either. They are a good quality blanket which haven't faded or pilled . They are smaller than the carters but, they hold up just as well."
2,not swaddle blnkt,"these are rather small for a swaddling blanket, i actually prefer the hospital ones over any. but otherwise make sure they are large, that goes for the hooded towels too."
2,Quality of item poor,I purchased two of the HP 57 Tri-Color Remanufactured Inkjet Ink Cartridges in April and have just started using one and want to say I have been ripped off with this product. The colors doesn't even come close to what they should be and some writing doesn't even show. I don't know if I even want to attempt using the second cartridge. Very poor quality control on this item and I certainly will not order anything else from this vender.Aubrey Durbin
5,Works Great!,I bought this remanufactured ink cartridge for an older HP printer (HP PSC 1350xi All-in-One) that I own. The ink for the older HP printers is twice the price of the ink for the newer HP printers since HP has come down on their ink prices within the last year or two. I had no problem installing and using this remanufactured ink cartridge. My printer is attached to an HP/Compaq desktop running Windows Vista.
4,JG from Massachusetts,Great product for the price. Printer accepted the cartridge without conflict and it works great.
5,Great Gun for the Money!,"This gun is a great buy. I beleive it's actually more powerfull than what the specs say. I like the weight of it. The only con is that it dosent seem to be consistantly accurate from more than 25 feet or so, but for $30, it's a bargain."
4,Nice quality airsoft gun for the most part,"The gun itself is pretty fun to use, and hasn't had any issues yet. However, the laser pointer was lacking in quality, and broke down after 1 month of use. Yikes! This was especially annoying since the laser was one of the major reasons I bought it. The flashlight is a nice feature though, along with the laser scope.Very good for shooting at squirrels!"
4,Italian Coffee Maker,"These make the most delicious coffee. I have a gas range, and the coffee is done much faster than with a typical coffee maker. I recommend you order additional seals when you purchase, as you will need them at some point."
5,Love this little pot,"I love this little pot. The Italians are right. It makes two espresso cups for lattes for me, and the taste is great. I have ordred some fresher espresso beans (hard to find in South Dakota) but even with my grocery store beans it's great. I also bought the frother and wow it works great. I had an espresso machine once and threw it out. This is a much better way to make espresso. Quick and easy and tasty. If I did again, I might order a bigger pot - 6 cup, but for me it is perfect."
5,"If you care about the originality and quality of your coffee, this is for you.","I was about buying a fancy single-cup espresso machin (Tassimo), byt fund out about the Moka Express. This is how millions of people have been brewing their espresso for many years and the coffee taste just as good as any fancy machin. There is a lot to experience with this little espresso maker, you can learn as you brew and the outcome is never bad. I spend 25$ on this plus 1.99$ on a little IKEa milk frother and now I make all those starbucks fancy coffees at home. Believe me, joy of brewing your coffee at home, with a little money, is not comparable with anything that you buy from coffee houses.Make sure you get the right size of this coffee pot. This will not make large mug of coffee like what you get from filter coffee makers. With a 3-cup Bialetti, you get enough coffee for 2 espresso shots, or two lattes, if you added milk."
4,Nice looking coffee machine,"I decided to spend the extra money to purchase the original Bialetti Moka coffee maker. They had cheap imitations at Ross (?). I read all of the reviews before buying this. This is a coffee maker, not an espresso maker. If you are a dedicated espresso drinker, this will not satisfy you. It makes two (demitasse) espresso-sized cups of coffee. The coffee taste is closer to an espresso than the cone filter, but it still doesn't satisfy my need for an espresso. The hints for use from the other reviews seemed to be accurate. I had originally used coffee ground for a cone filter, which is about right. I still found some grounds in the bottom of my cup. If you want an espresso, buy an espresso maker."
5,Bye bye Starbucks. Hellooo amazing Vanilla Latte.,"I bought this espresso maker about a week ago at the suggestion of my cousin who lives in Italy. Also bought a milk frother from Ikea ($2.99), some Illy espresso (2 pack for $25) and vanilla-flavored syrup from Starbucks with pump ($7). I have been drinking the yummiest vanilla lattes every morning. Takes a couple of minutes to make and they are delicious. Why the heck was I spending so much money at Starbucks everyday for all those years?! (By the way, my Italian cousin says never to refrigerate the espresso coffee. Just keep it on the counter.)"
5,excellent 3 cup espresso maker,"Does the trick, but let it season!! it took about 7-8 cups to ""taste"" right...i actually feel like I am in Italy again...okay not really....but with the right espresso..it tastes like its from Italy!! Which means it taste perfect!! My favorite blend to use is Kimbo Espresso Napoletano--fill the ""cup"", do not pack it, just fill till full, tap any excess down, screw on the bottom and the top and there you go..a nice taste of Napoli! yummmm"
5,Better than I expected!,"I like strong dark coffee and this pot delivers for me everyday since I purchased it. I stopped going to my favorite coffee shop due to the rising gas prices. I was spending (rough estimate) about 20.00 per week (includes tip) on espresso type drinks. I purchased this pot on Amazon along with a hand milk frother voila! Fresh brewed espresso type coffee every morning with freshly frothed milk. :) I want to graduate up to a bigger pot at some point but this one works beautifully for now.BTW, follow the directions down to the word. Make sure you brew that first pot of throw away coffee prior to making the real thing."
5,Best coffee maker in the world.,These are the best espresso/coffee makers in the world. It's my second only because I forgot to make sure the first was cleaned and dry for a while. This size will make one nice cup of coffee very quickly or three of the small espresso cups.
5,very good !!,"I just made my first cup of coffee in my new Bialetti and I'm very impressed! It is smooth and great tasting and it was very easy to use. I wonder, though, is the aluminum safe?"
2,Not so satisfied,Ok so this product as it says can make 3 cups of coffee actually can only make one cup honestly ..! I don't know why it says three cups ..! Unless they are talking about teene tiny cups .&#128530;
3,monsoon diary,"Before reading this book I knew little about Indian culture. I feel like this book was very well writeen, though the description was dull at some parts. Shoba Narayan touched on every aspect of Indian culture, from train rides (one of my favorite parts of the book) to summers spent with grandparents, to the marketplace, family names and importance, traditions, and a special emphasis on food. This book was delicious to read and made me wish I had tasted the food Shoba describes so scrumptiously. I would recommend this book to someone interested in light, informative reading, with an empty stomach."
5,A delightful journey with stops for food along the way,"I literally devoured this book. The recipes look delightful and I can't wait to try some of them.I work with a large staff, which is approximately 1/3 Indian, any of them Southern Indian. This book gave me an insight into a culture that is mysterious to the average American. And vegetarian to boot!Now, just to find a great Indian grocer, so I can purchase some of the ingredients, although where possible, the author provides more common substitutes.Highly recommended reading (and eating!)"
3,Not bad...,"I certainly wouldn't call this book terribly well-written, but it does provide some interesting details about a childhood spent in India. Descriptions of visits to her grandparents house in South India, the milkman who brings along his cow every morning, and delicious-sounding foods that were prepared during certain seasons all make this book worth reading. It goes quickly downhill, however, after the author moves to America and describes her formation as an artist and eventual arranged marriage (not as interesting as you might imagine). The author should have focused more on her childhood memories in India rather than turning the book into a vague biography that becomes downright boring by the end, with random descriptions of various family visits in America."
3,"A reasonable ""recipe""","The idea of interspersing food recipes in a novel is not new and indeed, for books depciting life in India, such treatment is aplenty. ""The Monsoon Diary"" tells of the author's childhood years growing up in Madras. I especially like the narration of how the author's arranged marriage took place, how she met her future hubby and how he proposed- that is quite interesting. I could not recall reading such narration from the first-person perspective. The rest of the book is quite mundane. Nonetheless, a credible debut."
4,A collectors item,"This album is filled with live tracks, demos, and bloopers of the Ben Folds Five band. It gives a look at the band on a deeper level instead of simply a musical level. It is almost like ""Inside the Music"" on VH1, except in CD form. It has a lot of repeat tracks from previous albums. The only new release is Eddie Walker. A good CD for collectors and Ben Folds Five fans or anyone looking for a better look at the band."
2,Throwaway,"These guys are my favorite group right now, but this is simply a throwaway, I guess to complete the record contract. Sound quality is variable at best and they crossed the line between spontaneous and sloppy. I'd hate for someone new to the group to pick this up first because it's a poor representation of how good they really are. However, it does nothing to deter my expectations that they will put out great work in the future. But this one -- put it in the category of ""For Hard Core Fans Only""."
1,one of the worst CDs EVER,"I consider myself a casual fan.I loved ""whatever and ever amen"" and looked forward to this. What a dissapointment! Not one reason to let it take up valuable space on my rack. I think they put this crap together to test the loyalty of the fans. If we bought it, they'd stay together. If not, they'd split up. They're capable of excellence. But don't judge them by this."
4,This CD should be added toward the end of your Ben Folds Five catalog collection...,"I like the songs on this CD but a good number of them are for the most part just raw earlier versions of tunes which were issued on the debut CD titled ""Ben Folds Five"" and/or ""Whatever and Amen"". I am pleased with the CD as It first exposed me to the tune ""Eddie Walker"" and that bent tune ""For Those Of Ya'll Who Wear Fanny Packs""..this alone made it worth the purchase price but I would recommend purchasing it after one has already acquired some of the other CDs in either Ben Folds Five or Ben Folds Solo Catalog (with the exception of Fear of Pop which is really really bent! but good! but still bent!)."
3,For hard core fans only,This was the last Ben Folds album I need to finish my collection. It was worth the purchase but was not my favorite album. It shows how much the band and Ben has grown over the years. Good to have in a collection but not a must have.
3,quite good for what it is,"this is a great example of how good a demo cd can actually be.three reasons to buy this:- best version of ""underground"" they put out. blows the studio version out of the water.- BUILT TO SPILL COVER!!!!!! i never thought that i'd want to hear anyone cover built to spill, but man, bff does a fantastic job of it!- this version of jackson cannery is pretty spectacular.there is one huge downside of buying this though. after listening to it 3 or 4 times you're gonna get really bored with it.i'm really waiting for ben folds to either put out a cd of built to spill covers or just tour with them. that would be truly incredible."
3,Better than most odds and ends compilations...,"""Uneven"" is a fairly accurate term to describe any album that represents B-sides, studio demos, and live rarities. At best though,(and this is one of those instances) there are enough diamonds in the rough to warrant a purchase from the die-hard fans. Casual fans or newcomers to Ben should check out their fabulous self-titled debut or ""Whatever"" over this. Still, it boasts two songs that no lover of modern pop music should be without: the breezy, hummable ""Emaline"" and a gorgeous, heart-breaking live cover of Built To Spill's ""Twin Falls""."
5,I love these guys!,"This CD is a definite must-have for any one who loves the sounds of Ben Folds Five. Their great humor shines through in every track, especially the live ones, and the jacket is great. I have to say the most hilarious track on the whole CD, and in all the Ben Folds i've ever heard for that matter, is track no. 7. You'll be rolling around on the ground weeping after you listen to that track. Ben Folds Five is a unique band with great talent and this album is no exception."
4,BFF does it again,"Okay, this is a CD fill of B-sides and live performances. Know this before you buy the CD!! If you are just starting to listen to BFF, get a different CD... If you love these guys, GET THIS!! It is an excellent collection of stuff if you just can't get enough BFF. Eddie Walker is stunning, Fanny Packs is Hilarious, and most of the live performances are worth your listening to."
5,Endless creativity,"Naked Baby Photos was not my introduction to Ben Folds Five (thank God for mix tapes), but it was the first BFF album I purchased. I was immediately hooked, and introduced a friend to their music through this album as well. I think it's the perfect mix of humor (offbeat humor, yes, but I can't help loving it), poignance, creativity, and, simply put, excellent songwriting."
4,People need to stop comparing this to their studio albums.,"I bought this the day it was released and found (and still find) it to be a fascinating look at the creative process and drive behind BFF. If you bought the first two albums and dig them, you won't be disappointed, but don't buy this first. The key to enjoying this collection is to take it for what it is: naked baby photos. It's not SUPPOSED to sound as good as their studio albums. It's kind of like a scrapbook of demos and live performances in the vein of the Beatle's anthology project. My only regret is that ""Champagne Supernova"" and ""Mitchell Lane"" were not included, as I only have them on cassette. Bottom line: This album is extremely good for the type of album it is. If you have it and don't like it, read the liner notes and stop dissing it just cause it doesn't have that bloated, overrated throwaway ""Brick."""
2,"Snore-fest, USA","First of all, ""alot"" isn't a word.But that's neither here nor there.What's here AND there is this band. Bigelf never fail to sound like a dilapidated carousel sputtering out its last breath. That might be okay for one song per album (just like The Beatles and Saigon Kick used to do), but for every stinking song to sound this way is unforgivable. There are A LOT (two words) of people out there who enjoy this kinda thing, and I think that's great. ""There's someone for everyone and Tommy's love was Becky"" (you Kenny Rogers fans know what I'm talkin' about) BUT this is not for me. I'll gladly listen to the worst of ELO (""No Answer"") rather than listen to this big, giant, little elf's music again.In short: Not for me. [Take that for what it's worth]Love,A Future Fan"
5,Blah Blah Blah Blah,"I'm just echoing the sentiments of others by asking why the 12 inch versions of this album (many on this release) are being overlooked. Just add another ""Blah"" and you've got an extended release and title. Bowie's influence among others made this album shine in a way that Iggy deserved beyond his legendary contribution to loud and cool."
3,"Get it, if only...","This is probably his most commercial sounding album, which is a let down, obviously (for any real fan of his work). Plus it sounds extremely dated in an 80s, "" money for nothing "" sort of way - however "" Real Wild Child "" is still pretty catchy. ""Shades"" is a guility pleasure, a very well done ballad. Where Iggy really shows his greatness is on the title track, "" Blah Blah Blah."" It definitely rocks, even with minimal guitar work, with pounding, driving synth work (yes, really). It's the one great track on here, and lyrically gives the finger to everything fake and hypocritical about our nation."
1,Blah Blah Blah is right!,"This is a regrettable Iggy album. Its all synths and new wave crap. I get irritated listening to it. Its embarrassing from the Godfather of punk. For Iggy at his best, try ""Raw Power"" Beat Em Up"", ""Fun House"" or ""Skull Ring"". Leave this lame, Bowie induced, glam, new wave, queer junk in the bargain bin where it can fester forever."
1,Terrible album,"This album constitutes an indelible stain on Iggy's great solo career, I really hope ""Blah, blah, blah"" will be out of stock forever and never reissued again."
1,"Blah, Blah, Bleck","So many have connected this album to Bowie, and they are correct. Now throw in the fact that Bowie has said the 80's were without a doubt the lowest point in his career and he absolutely hates the junk he made. That should give you a little insite on this album. Ig needed to appeal to as many people as he could with this album, and I think he did a great job at that. It's pure junk food for the mind and spirit. Perfect for the time's it was created. Actually, Iggy, in my opinion, has never recovered from this uninspired album. With few exceptions, most music Iggy has made since Zombie Birdhouse has catered to a fan with a bland palate. I had such hopes for Skull Ring. Disappointed again. Don't bother with this album if you like a wild Iggy, he's just a parody of himself."
4,One of Iggy's Best!!,"I don't care what anyone says! This is a fine, mature, professional Iggy Pop album that shows his songwriting at its best, but it's still charged with that rambunctious unpredictable Iggy energy. And highly danceable!""Real Wild Child"", ""Winners and Losers"", ""Cry for Love"", and ""Fire Girl"" rock; ""Shades"" is a warm, thoughtful, unlikely masterpiece (a tribute to his favorite sunglasses and the lover who gave them to him)--probably the best song on the album. A close second is ""Hideaway"", a haunting atmospheric lament that still goes out rocking, with great guitars and a power beat. (And a damn good jogging tune for your Ipod!)Overall there is a warm glow to this album; play it at 3 in the afternoon with the sun coming through the windows and tequila on the table."
3,Not as good as Lieberman but acceptable.,"Mr. Kaminsky is a gifted writer but this is not his best series. If you haven't read Lieberman's Choice or Lieberman's Folly, try them instead of Lew Fonesca. If you have read Lieberman then you know what Mr. Kaminsky is capable of. So try his Inspector Rostnikow series. Still this is a good beach book."
5,When one book leads you to read three other books...,"surely it is worth five stars, is it not? This was the third novel in a series featuring Lew Fonesca, a grieving widower who relocates from Chicago to Florida and nearly gives up on life. It was the first of the series that I read, but now I've added book one, Vengeance, and book two, Retribution, and am about to start on the newest, Denial. Fonesca fascinates me. Through the four books, which probably cover less than two years in his life, he slowly builds a new network of family and friends and even a love interest. He solves mysteries, taking jobs as a finder of missing persons and as a process server. He gets into danger. He does not commit acts of violence. He lives simply, but thinks deeply. He believes he does not ""feel"" deeply anymore, due to the tragic loss of his wife, but his actions prove that he does. Kaminsky writes a ton of books, with five different series heroes, and all of them are worth checking out."
5,Golden Oldie,"For any Dion fans, this is the CD to buy. One great song after another. Shipment arrived very quickly and in perfect condition."
1,Relief Carving,I was very impressed with the designs and they are not so complicated that even an inexperienced carver can create a masterpiece. I feel the book is well worth its cost.
5,"""an eye for a eye head for a head""",Man what can I say.....I LOVE horror films mostly b movies this film takes the cake on sico type horror!!! It is a great film but you are let sitting there saying wtf and why did I watch this lol...Buy this movie you will love it!!!
1,Do not waste your time,"Horrible. Words cannot describe how badly this film was made. I am usually pretty lenient with horror films, but this was beyond disgusting. The acting was very bad, some of the dialogue and plot made no sense. Finding out the act of ""heading"" actually was disturbed me. Worst horror film ever seen so far."
1,Not worth watching,It was a stupid B movie with a horrible plot and really bad acting. The story is disturbing but all around the movie was really bad.
2,Overly formulistic,"Dispite the reviews on the Amazon web page ruining any suspense and giving away all of the plot turns i finished this book anyway. It is unfortunatly overly formulistic and extremly predictable, sadly i have read this book before in several guises. Shame it's a good title. And not a bad premise."
5,Impressive...,"...most impressive. When I was 21 I was out drinking beers, but I can't believe that a 20 yr old wrote this book. I think it borrowed a lot from quantum physics, but the story and idea were original. The plot is better than most books because it doesn't steal from Star Wars or other classics. Dennagon was very interesting. He's not fighting for power, he's fighting for truth. And it was a quick read with big bold letters. Less is more."
5,Behind the book,"Reading all the other reviews I'm sure you caught on with what this book is about. A mix of fantasy creatures in a sci-fi novel. That in itself makes the book unique so if your wondering whether if you should read this book or not, my advice is that you should. If you're into sci-fi you'll find it very interesting if not you might be lost. I bought this book because Eng graduated from my H.S, Cardozo so I thought it'd be cool to read it, then I hesitated because I found out he finished this 348 page novel within about a month. I lowered my expectations since I thought it was going to be something quickly thrown together but I really shouldn't have. Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate it amazing, even without considering that the author is 21 and finished it in no time. Kind of blows the whole Eragon, author started when he was 15 then finished the book four years later. Expect a sequel, he's working on it now."
4,Pretty good,"I don't know about everyone else, but I like sa quick read. Most novels just have so much garbage in them that it feels like I'm in elementary school again, but I read this in HS and it's pretty cool. I mean, how many other school books have Technodragons in them?Though the characters were a little stock, the action was awesome. I could so imagine the Dennagon killing spree being in the movies. Recommended."
1,Well Done Book,"Straight to it: DLT, one star out of five; plot is slow and thick; characters are too ""far out;"" writing style undeveloped; settings are unbelievable (even for fantasy); cover is (pardon this word) ""cheesy;"" one good thing about it (pointed out by Jerry Wright aka ""Mr. Bewildered"") is that the book itself is well done, with good binding and paper, unfortunately for the writer, thought, that part has nothing to do with him."
2,Only enjoyable if you don't take it seriously,"Everything from the pacing to the characterization is too outlandish to take seriously and any attempts to read it as a serious work of fiction led to a headache within a minute. In truth, it read more like a farce (and that is often times a stretch) and can only be enjoyed in the same fashion as the movies mocked in the mystery science theater 3000 could be."
5,Totally overlooked,This group is nothing short of amazing they would remind you a little of cameo on a few cuts but totally self defined effort here too bad they just made one CD
4,Another fine film from the past...,That will never be made in hollyweird this day without being reaped of anything worth merit. Passion!Romance (both adventure and love)!Action!and most of all... A friggin PLOT!Buy it if you love Hollywood before it became hollyweird.
3,Great movie,I orderd this and a few others as gifts. The DVD works great. Love the story. Would recommend this to anyone.
3,"Not bad, but not a great movie","""Barabbas"" is not a bad movie if you are watching it simply for the entertainment value. Anthony Quinn is very good and so are his co-stars. The script drags somewhat, with the second part being more interesting than the first. However, if you are wanting to look at this film in the sense of whether it portrays the message of Christianity well, then this movie is less than average. It portrays early Christians well, but the problem is with the portrayal of Barabbas. There is no complexity in the character of Barabbas, he simply ""goes with the flow."" There is never true repentence on his part, never a true understanding of the meaning of Christ and Christianity. It is simply not a film you would want to show your children if you want them to have a deeper understanding of their faith. For great classical gladiatoral action, this is a great movie (Jack Palance is wonderful), but it fails in portraying any deeper spiritual message."
3,What if....,"The imaginative novel by Par Lagerkvist that ponders what might have happened to Barabbas once he was freed by the Romans, his place taken by Jesus at Calvary, certainly inspired Dino de Laurentiis' own imagination. Dino decided to hire everybody in Hollywood who was looking for work and whipped up this overlong 137 minute epic to compete in the post-""Ben Hur"" movie spectacular era of the early '60s. Anthony Quinn grunts and groans his way through the entire film wondering, ""Why me?"" Arthur Kennedy in a toga does not a Roman make. Silvana Mangano (Mrs. de Laurentiis) literally gets stoned in a cameo appearance. Dino, what were you thinking? Lots of other ""name"" actors try to make a go of it, but it is only Jack Palance who may have a handle on things with his comically camp gladiator in a chariot. Hmmm, wonder where they got the idea for the chariot?"
2,Amazon Fan,"I bought this movie for my wife who is a Bible movie fan. The movie is not a great movie. The plot is unrealistic and difficult to follow. So unless, like me, you just want it for your collection, pass this one by."
3,God Provides Special Effect On Cue,"Anthony Quinn gives a good, tortured portrayal in this speculative movie of what happened to Barabbas after the death of Jesus. Although a bit slow in places, the film manages to keep the viewer interested in what will become of this poor character. One fact about the film that a lot of people do not know is that the sequence featuring Christ's crucifiction was shot during a REAL solar eclipse. This lends an eerie and divine backdrop to the crucifiction and sets the mood for Barabbas' journey to his ultimate destiny."
3,Interesting if you ignore the details...,"Barabbas is an interesting ""what if"" presentation of Barabbas the man who was saved from execution when Jesus was crucified in his stead. The movie is heavily slanted towards a view of Christianity that seems to be highly superstitious and primarily focused on signs, symbols, and ritual.Anthony Quinn does a great job in portraying a conflicted character who ebbs back and forth between belief and doubt."
4,A good film for those interested in a story not effects...,"I like this movie because of its meeningful message. Like many movies made in Hollywood before the Babyboomers took over, This movie has a positive christian message inbedded in a serious plot that causes the viewer to simpathise with the lead chararter Barabbus and hope for him. overall a likeble flim."
4,Very good,"I enjoyed watching Barabbas very much. However, this movie is just a notch below other movies of this genre. I assume production costs were considerable less than Ben Hur and The10 Commandments at that may have caused the movie to be behind these other classics."
4,Very glad I bought it!,"This is a very well-written and well-acted script. The story takes the Bible narrative about Barabbas and goes on with what happened after the Crucifixion of Jesus, and the impact that all its circumstances had on this man. Very imaginative and true to the historical period. I recommend it to anyone who likes old movies, Bible movies, or movies from the days of the Roman empire."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable epic with a lackluster transfer,"This would have to rate as one of the better Biblical epics, especially once one gets past the rather slow beginning. My only complaint at all would be with the DVD. This isn't to say that the movie was transferred poorly, but rather that the source film had seen its better days. While NOT riddled with dirt or grain, there are portions of the film which appear extremely washed out or faded...rather like a picture that has been sitting in the sun too long. It is not a consistent problem, as some scenes look spectacular.Overall, I'd say Columbia needs to do a little restoration and re-release this film. However, given it's rather obscure status, I'm doubting this will ever be done. So get this one, and enjoy."
3,Good Urdu Studio Recordings,"I was just a little disappointed with the selections on the cd set. They are not bad studio recordings of some of his songs, but there wasn't the same passion that you can find in his live recordings. Also, there was a lack of variety in the qawwalis, there were no punjabi selections. Overall, not a bad set though, but there are better Nusrat Khan CDs out there."
3,Too short information,The description too short. It should be figure out what methode or tool that used in this book.
1,Can't say it works.,"One of the many problems I had to solve in growing tomatoes in Puerto Rico was getting pollinated blooms on the tomato plants--as they were dying off. I purchased this product to solve that problem. At first I thought it worked but later changed my mind. Getting numerous blooms was done by simply using compost tea--see videos on youtube. The problem then became how to get the many blooms to pollinate--that problem was solved by using a battery-operated toothbrush to manually pollinate the blooms--again, see videos on youtube. THe problem now is supporting the many tomatoes as the weight breaks the stems. I found the Tomato Bloom to be useless and threw it away."
4,Worth the Price,"I ordered these pair of Skull License Plate Fastners to dress up a new license plate frame. They are as I expected for the price. The appearance new is very good. The skull portion feels very cheap and light. I can't tell if they are plastic or very light weight metal but they do include two washers, a lock washer and the nut to tighten on the bolt threads. The skull is threaded onto the included bolt shaft. I am using loctite so the skull cannot be just hand unscrewed from the bolt and taken off the vehicle. I am only using them to fill the two extra bottom holes on the licensed plate frame since the license plate and frame are mounted to my vehicle by the top of the frame only. I feel these fasteners will be adequate for this if they do not rust or degrade in appearance. I do not think I would use them to attach the plate and frame to the vehicle as they feel too light."
4,"Cool lookin, wish it came in 4 pack","Nothing fancy but they sure do look flashy on my truck. The only thing is you only get a set of 2 but that's no biggie, I just ordered 2 sets of these for both front and rear plates. If you already have the skull shifter and skull door locks, I highly suggest you get these license plate fasteners to complete the skull collection."
5,Looks great,These skull license plate fastners look great on the bike. Was tired of just plain screws or red reflector types.
4,Fits good and looks good,These work great to hold my bike's license plates in place and they look pretty cool too. The washers won't lose the tightness with the vibration.
5,These are super duper!,"I love 'em! They look so cool on my bike. I plan to order more for my other bike. Maybe, evenmy car. Nice product, well done."
3,"These sellers are Crooks, on price & S&H","Although I found the product likeable, I found it too be overpriced, and the sellers are ""THIEVES"" from the word go on their shipping and handling. They advised me that it would cost $ 7.17 to mail this 4 ounce product first class mail. But when I received the product I took it too the post office to double check how much the seller paid to ship my product, it turned out that the seller only paid $ 1.73 to mail my order, leaving the seller with a profite of $ 5.44 to put in their own pockets. These people are ""CROOKS"", & ""THIEVES"" from the get go. Avoid purchasing anything from this seller. The products are way over priced, and they LIE about the cost of S&H."
2,Video lacks substantive detail,"The video ""Insomnia"" from the Mayo Clinic wellness solutions series provides some practical advise for dealing with insomnia, but lacks specific detail. A portion of the video gives general advise about eating healthy food that applies to all aspects of health and is not particular to insomnia. A portion of the video shows an extremely fit yoga master sitting in a cross legged position that would probably cripple me. While yoga seems like a good idea for physical and emotional health, the sitting position of this yoga master is simply unrealistic for most people. The discussion of conventional therapies is so vague as to be essentially useless. This video doesn't provide as much education about the subject as I had hoped and left me disappointed with the lack of substance."
1,Worthless for insomnia,I bought it. I watched it. I found it useless because it is so vague. It's more an infomercial for Mr Lee and his yoga class than anything else. It only cost $5+ so it was easy to stick in the trash. Let me save you time and $...here is the substance of the video. Insomnia is a problem. Eat a healthy diet. Exercise. Explore yoga. Sleep. Ha.
3,first grunge album? i dont think so..,"The Replacements did everything much better and for longer than Soul Asylum. Paul Westerberg makes Dave Pirner look like GG Allen. That said, this is an entertaining album. Not bad. Anything by the Mats is better."
5,My All-Time Favorite Album,"This album displays all that is great about Soul Asylum. Catchy hooks, raucous guitar, and clever lyrics. The guitar interplay between Dan Murphy and Dave Pirner is phenomonal, and their talent becomes even more evident live. Their shows from the late 80's/early 90's are still some of the best I've ever seen. This is the quintessential guitar rock record. I remember something Dave Pirner said in an interview, as Soul Asylum toiled in obscurity back in the early 90's, ""We had guitars first, so we win"". Amen."
3,Not the one to pick up,"I've read a few Doctorows in my time and would rank this one the lowest. The writing is crisp and pungent, like an autumn breeze, but the book just never quite blew strongly enough to fill my sails.This book, creepy and macabre, is not a bad book. However, it is a new genre for Doctorow, one that he has perhaps not yet mastered. He said the book was written in honor of Edgar Allen Poe, his own father's favorite author. Indeed, the spirit of Poe is present here. Yet Doctorow never quite attains the dark transit of Poe."
2,Thin and Pretentious,"I found this book unsatisfying.Although it tries to evoke the same turn of the century portrait as the Alienist (by Caleb Carr), The Waterworks does not succeed. The plot is thin and characters not fully developed. The author struck me as more interested in the writing than the story and in style over substance.This book has been described as American literature. If this is literature, I prefer a good old American novel."
3,"An interesting post-civil war setting, but...","An excerpt from a letter to my author-friend, D.Stanwood: Thanks for your letter and for sending the Le Carre book. I've just finished The Waterworks by E.L. Doctorow, which has been kind of a slow read for me. It seems to me that this author, talented as he is -- and the style is strikingly elaborate -- gets so mired in his ornate descriptions of the human condition that the story telling sort of takes a back seat in the process. Built around the shenanigans of William Marcy (""Boss"") Tweed's corrupt government in 1870 New York, the premise holds plenty of potential for juicy suspense but just doesn't quite deliver. I imagine the Lit critics quite disagreed, so this is only my take and nothing more. I did not read Ragtime but I loved the story as it was told on film, and I know he is brilliant. In all fairness, I am not a patient reader, but I expected more from The Waterworks. --- Best, Don"
3,"OK, not excellent","This is my first reading of Doctorow, and this particular book doesn't seem worthy of the praise I here in association of him. It was an interesting read and it made me smile upon recognizing certain historical figures as they were mentioned (i.e. Boss Tweed), but the novel didn't tell me anything I didn't learn in high school American History. The setting was inconsequential and the main plotline was a somewhat absurd piece of science fiction. This one really strains one's suspention of disbelief. The story, overall, was entertaining, though in spite of it's shortness, by the end the story drags. This is probably because I couldn't wait to finish the book and move on to something more substantial. I'll try Ragtime and City of God in hopes that this was a low-point for Doctorow."
2,"Difficult to read, not for beginners",I was given this book for my Database Management Class. I found as a beginner it was full of jargon and therefore difficult to read. It was rather overwhelming and confusing.
2,Meh,"Keeps time all right. The radio is so tinny and trebly that it sounds like one of those old 60's pocket AM radios. The tuner also tends to lose its lock on stations. But I don't use the radio; I wake up by the beeping alarm, which is sufficiently annoying to get me out of bed.This gets the job done - barely - but there are far, far better clock radios out there. This product is a good example of ""you get what you pay for."""
3,Average thriller at best,"Most of the reviewers are getting caught up in the religious aspect of the movie. I say that is a secondary element - this is still a horror movie first and secondarily is a horror movie about religious people gone wrong, which, I suppose, characterizes this more as a documentary than a fictional movie :). Overall, the movie was mostly average. It was atmospherically fun and different having been set in a subway system, and drew interesting parallels to ""sleeper cell""-like armies just waiting to be activated. There were a few good scares for sure, and some good creepy moments. However, it was just average for me. There's nothing particularly memorable or inspiring enough to make me want to watch the movie again. So I'd probably highly rate it for rental purposes, but would not advocate buying before seeing."
1,Christian assassins gone wild,A not very convincing story line. Acting fair to good. I rented this movie out of curiosity. A group of survivors trying to avoid Christian assassins armed with cross shaped daggers who were slaughtering everyone they can find to save them from the demons which are supposed to take over the world so the slaughtered can go to heaven. Then just before midnight when demons were about to emerge the nut cases gave each other poison pills (they will go to hell if they commit suicide according to the Christian bible). Obviously these people trying to escape the murderers hadn't watched to many horror movies and split up instead of sticking together and got killed one at a time except... I don't want to spoil the ending so go watch it--Its definitely scary. Some scenes were confusing.
2,"Slow, Boring, Scary.........How Bad It Was.","Purchased this movie based on several rave reviews I read on the net. Ordered it quickly from Amazon and man what a waste of time and money. Aside from the lead actress, very bad acting, slow pace, the religious nut were way over the top and not enough demons. Complete bore, don't waste your pennies or time."
1,Horrible and offensive... and not in a good way,"This movie has no redeeming quality about it. I'm not a religious person, but was offended at how they used a religion to write a plot... and a horrible one at that.I can sum up how horribly offending this movie is with the scene that made me eject the disc. In the name of God, a pregnant woman volunteers to get stabbed to death in her stomach. The next scene is her and her husband dead and bloody with the unborn dead bloody fetus put on top.Even if not offensive, the movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen (and I've seen some bad movies) and a plot that goes nowhere."
3,Not bad for DTV,"With a Sci Fi Saturday night slant, this movie isn't that bad. Keep an open mind and just watch the movie without expecting much. The acting and effects are lacking but for what they were working with it was worth a look.Again I ask why can't Asylum make movies like this???"
4,RETURN OF THE MORAL MAJORITY...,"It's finally happened! The apocalypse has come, and the righteous few have only a short time to save the lost. Thankfully, they have their trusty crucifix-knives ready for stabbing their targets into eternal salvation! END OF THE LINE takes religious fanaticism / cultism to new heights (depths?) by playing out the ""end times"" in a subway system. We are there as a small group of sinners tries to stay one step ahead of those who wish to express their kindness through grisly murder (aka: God's love)! I enjoyed the idea of the TV preacher contacting his flock through pagers, turning them into lethal assassins for the Lord! Also, the ""demons' are well-done and not over-used. Worth owning..."
4,"WOW .. REAL GOOD SCARE, GORE & NICLEY DONE!!","It's a full moon and all of the crazies come out. The End of the Line was a dark and twisted piece of work. With a job at a mental hospital, Karen has seen every kind of crazy, but tonight it seems they are coming out of the woodwork. A religious cult, which would put Jim Jones out of business, is preparing for the coming Armegeddon. I was impressed with the moreso head trip, than the actual scare factor. The gore was a bit over the top fake, but just the right amount to give you the cringe factor. This was not a masterpiece by any means, but an original idea that was pulled off very well."
1,Not worth it.,"Despite the claims in the Editorial Review Description of this video, there is virtually nothing new here, and certainly no new ""methods of training"" or schedules. In fact, there's about thirty seconds on sets and reps toward the beginning of the video, much of which is contradicted when Glass talks about individual exercises. There's nothing on body part splits or how many days to work out, nothing on intensity, and nothing on weight selection. Basically, the video consists of the demonstration of one-to-two exercises per body part, with Glass offering a few helpful tips on exercise performance. The production values are low, and the video is simply not worth the money."
4,Awesome Puzzle,My almost-4-yr-old got this as a gift and absolutely LoVES it! She does the puzzle at least once a day. The seek and find aspect is fun for her too. This is one toy she never gets tired of!
2,Actually found them to be stiffer than their rating,"Ordered Rico Royal 2.0, they seem similar to the Vandoren 2.0, much harder to play than a regular Rico 2.0, more like a Rico 2.5 - 3.0. I needed to step up anyway but these wiped out my lip after 40 minutes of practice. Granted, I'm just a beginner (less than a year), but I could go for 2 hours at least on the regular Rico 2.0. One other thing, there's a fine line between getting good clarinet tone and a horrible raspy sound, especially in the low register. Bottom line, I won't be buying these again."
3,"Good for kids, not for adults","The reeds are much much softer than Vandoren 2.5s and if you're an adult trying to learn how to play, then I suggest you pick up a 2.5 instead because your natural embouchure will most likely be tighter than a kid's. The sound is a bit buzzy as compared to Vandoren's though. But if you're going for ease of use, this is okay."
4,Nice product!,These reeds are better than Rico normal ones. My overall sound just got better. Fast shipping and great service at Amazon.
4,Surprisingly Excellent Reed for Low Price,"The Rico Royal is a surprisingly good reed for the price. While Vandoren is the industry standard for reeds the Rico Royal has a nice bright sound with a high quality count on the reeds in the box. Almost all of them were playable after some shaping and approximately four or five were extremely playable right out of the box. I had to work much more with my Vandorens to get the instant high quality playability from them.Word of note though. This is a fairly hard reed and is perhaps more suitable for players with a more closed mouthpiece, which means the gap between the reed and the face of the mouthpiece is narrow. Those with a wider gap may prefer either a softer reed or perhaps a different brand."
2,Rico royal reeds. A royal PAIN.,"If you are going to buy these reeds, you may be thinking ""these must be better than regular rico reeds!"" Trust me, they are not. Rico reeds perform 100 times better than their ""royal"" relations. Rico royal reeds water-log easily and are softer than normal rico reeds. Despite the description on the back of the box, normal rico reeds react quicker and sound better than rico royal reeds. Besides, if rico ""royal"" reeds are only $2.00 more than normal rico reed, you can't expect them to be THAT much better."
1,I recieved the Wrong kind of Reeds,The ad states Rico Royal Clarinet Bb Box Of 10 Reeds Strength 1.5.I recieved soprano sax Reeds.
5,Nice alternative to more expensive reeds,"My son likes these just as well, if not better, than the more expensive alternatives. I find they do produce a nice tone, but don't last quite as long."
5,awesome i love them!!!,awesome i love the tone and last long i would lean more to the 2.5 size because i always bump my tooth on there but they barely chip or brake! also i learned with the 2.0 stengths if you slide them in the holder and hit the side it will tear when its wet. but other then that AWESOME!!!!
4,good reeds,This is a solid reed for school kids. I would give a better mark had the reeds been less inclined to chip.
2,i bought it splinted my lip,i bought it splinted my lip. i had to throw it away. it didnt work on my clerenet that is why
4,The way I remembered,"I saw this movie way back in 1976, and this DVD is uncut and my spined got chilled as much as way back the first time I saw it."
5,Still Chilling 30 Years Later,"I found this to be one of the more interesting made-for-TV films I've ever watched, thanks to the sensationalism of the true-life story and the mesmerizing performances of the lead villain (Steve Railsback) and his followers. Railsback plays the infamous Charles Manson.Railsback's eyes alone are frighteningly haunting to this viewer, 30 years after first seeing it. By the way, my VHS tape has one f-word in the film, which would never be allowed on TV. What gives with that? Whatever, I wouldn't mind getting the DVD of this, since the top reviewer here said it was a great transfer.As for the Manson ""gang,"" the most frightening people, as a whole, were the women who did Manson's killing for him. I was creeped out more by Nancy Wolfe's chilling performance of Susan Atkins than I did was by anyone else, including the famous ""Charlie.""The film has turned out to be a pretty good piece of American history, the kind of crime history we'd like to forget."
5,One of the most terrifying stories ever told,"Charlie Manson is, to many, the face of evil. After reading the Best Selling book, Helter Skelter, you will need to watch this film. If you are a fan of true crime, horror, or if you are interested in a time in our history where everyone was horrified.....watch Helter Skelter."
4,An interesting but crazy man,"What can you say, Manson is a nut. Simple. My wife had watched this when it first came out and told me about it. So, I ordered it for her. We sat down and watched it, it surprised her with all the extras in it that was never shown on TV. Overall, considering how old the movie is, it was just uncanny how some actors can get so into a character and show you how sadistic they could really be."
5,Review or Rearview,"I give HELTER SKELTER a Review gotta have it!If your into crime watch, this is for you.True story, eerie, creepy, you'll watch overand over."
1,Helter Skelter,I ordered this movie after seeing it several times over the years and I have read the book. The problem I have is the fact that the DVD's I ordered were defective discs. Both DVD's arrived scratched to h*ll and back. I would not advise ordering anything from these guys unless you're fond of defective products.
3,Helter Skelter,"I must say I expected a copy of the VHS Helter Skelter on DVD.While factually the story drags on, the original TV movie was NOT a documentary. Can I purchase the original TV movie on DVD?"
1,Poor Production Values,"This is a 50 minute lecture by Abbot John Daido Loori on Zen Meditation, shot using only one video camera. The back cover explains Abbot Loori is a Zen priest of over 20 years experience and that he is a resident Zen teacher and spiritual director of Zen Mountain Monastery in the Catskills of New York State. He explains the sitting postures, mind-breath exercises and meditation which make up Zen. So far so good.However, the whole project is undermined by the lack of production values: poor editing, poor camerawork, awful exposures, poor sound - all the hallmarks of a home-video. There is very little to recommend here."
1,Waste of money!!!,"I am very, very dissapointed with this breast pump, it takes me about an hour just to pump one side and I only used it once or twice a week. Also it's hard to clean, way too many parts, and milk always gets into the handle. I do not recomend it to any one!"
2,no foot pedal included with my pump,please make sure that your package says something about having a foot pedal with your pump. i ordered this because i have very sore hands and pumping would really make them hurt. i wrote...to find out why it didn't come with one i think that it is an extra part you have to purchase so just so you know it doesn't come with the package. you may want to call to ask first .
1,Don't waste your effort!,"This is the worst manual pump that I have ever had experience with; I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about breast pumps from both personal and professional experience as a labor and delivery/postpartum nurse and a mother of two. It is difficult to assemble in order to get a good seal, and even then, I was only able to get a small amount of milk pumped, and it took too much time. I even called the helpline and was simply told that ""this pump does not work for everyone."" I would recommend the Avent Isis over this one. The only reason I tried this pump was because my original Avent Isis pump broke and the price was half the price of the Isis--now I see why! I promptly returned this one to The First Years for a refund."
2,you get what you pay for,"I'm the one who always buys generic to save a little money here and there. BIG MISTAKE with breastpumps! It seems like you get exactly what you pay for. I bought this when I was nursing my son. I stay at home, so I only needed it to pump occasional bottles for trips to the babysitter or when we'll be gone from home for a long period of time and breastfeeding isn't easily done. I was able to express maybe a half ounce of milk after pumping for 20 minutes, after which my hand and my nipples were sore. Tried several more times, no luck. Threw it out and got the Avent Isis, which worked a little better, but still not that great. Finally broke down and realized I should've spent the money on the best product in the first place and got the Medela Harmony which worked like a dream! With all the money I spent buying the three manual pumps I almost could've gotten a double-electric!"
2,not worth it,"I must have just focused on the ""good"" reviews on this site, and been blinded by the saving at the checkout counter, because I was under the assunption it would be just fine for my needs. I used this a few times, and it just kept losing suction. It was great at first, but now I figure, why waste my time. I still use it because I use the milk for my sons cereal,and I want to have extra milk on hand ""just in case"", but I cannot wait to get something else.You definitely get what you pay for!"
2,stopped working,"I bought this product to keep at bedside for quick use at night. Initially, it worked great. I could pump both breast just as fast as I could using my electric pump. I was beginning to think that I wasted money on the electric one - until this manual one stopped working. I reassembled it numerous times, but never could get it to suction like before. After reading reviews, I realized that I am not the only one that this has happened to. This product was great for the short amount of time that it worked (about 3 weeks), so if you are lucky enough to get a good one, it is well worth the $20. I, however, bought a DUD!"
3,Okay for the money . . .,"I bought this pump based on the reviews and because of how inexpensive it was. Well, you definitely get what you pay for. I would say it's a good pump for the price. The best thing about it is that it doesn't hurt when you use it and it's easy to use. The worst thing is that it can be extremely time consuming and is difficult to take apart and put back together. The actual pump part some times falls apart during pumping and I've had to take it apart and fix it in order to resume, which can be really annoying. Since I don't pump that often, I don't mind using this but if I did, I would definitely buy a better pump."
3,not as good as avent isis,I was unable to find additional bottles for this product. The pump is not sturdy I don't think it will last a year.
1,Same Problems as everyone else,"I noticed that some gave this pump high ratings but over all this pump gets just 3 stars. Maybe some have had better luck with this than others but I noticed that more people stated that it didn't work well. I bought this pump and right away I had problems when I would be pumping it would fall apart. It made my breasts hurt like they have never hurt before with any other pump Ive used in the past. You get what you pay for if you are going back to work you might want to invest in an electric Breast pump, I bought the Playtex Embrace double breast pump and it works wonderfully.PS When I called TFY about my problems the lady just told me how to put it back together (that wasn't the problem) and got off the phone quickly with me. This went into the trash where it belongs"
2,Doesn't work,"The item I bought doesn't assemble right, the blue thing just doesn't lock with the bottom part attached to it so i returned it for replacement. When the replacement came, they assemble right but i can't just get any milk at all despite several attemps and I didn't feel any sucking pressure. I am not sure if i was just doing it wrong but it was useless."
1,A horrible product,"This is a truly horrible product. After buying it, two nurses told us what a waste of money it is, and they are correct. While the company is great at replacing any broken part of the pump, they will not give you your money back and neither will the traditional retailer. I don't know if Amazon will.Don't waste your time, energy, or money on this. I would say that ""it sucks,"" but unfortunately, it doesn't."
1,horrible pump!,i wish i had read the reviews before buying this product. it's just as bad as the others say it is. do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on one that lasts longer and does a better (and quicker) job.
2,no nipples available for the containers,"the pump works well, especially in the morning when the body produces more milk (3 oz in 10 min). what is frustrating is that the package does not come with nipples for the 2 containers and pouring the milk from the container to a bottle can lead to milk spills, very upsetting experiences.i wanted to buy the nipples and neither baby r us nor target had any"
1,Never again...,"My wife bought it 4 mo. ago or so but start useing it 5 weeks ago. At first she complained that its very inconvinient to use and dhe were never able do disasemble pump to clean it. Even for me it was almosi imposible to unscrew the blue ring, but pump was leaking from alover. Won't buy any TheFY product again."
2,Non-standard bottles a pain.,"This pump worked reasonably well for the price, but it is impossible to feed directly from the bottles because they are a non-standard size and no nipples are provided. I thought when I bought this pump that the bottles were the same size as the wide mouth Avent bottles, but they're not. I looked for nipples that would work with these bottles, but was unable to find any."
1,"Great, when it works....","We've bought two of these for my wife. When they work, they work well. The problem is that it's way too easy to break the seal inside the handle casing , which results in the handle popping out and acting broken. This happens regularly.FYI - how you fix it:1) Twist the blue ring to separate the handle assembly from the bottle and funnel.2) Turn the handle assembly upside down and find the small hole in the blue part3) Rotate the blue part until the hole lines up exactly in the center of the handle3) Separate the blue piece from the white and you can then see the clear silicon - you should also see that it no longer has a tight seal.4) Remove, wash, replace and reassemble - solves the suction problem until it happens again (and it will happen again, often)."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this pump on vacation because I accidentally left my good electric pump (Medela) at home. I was terribly disapointed with this pump from the first moment I took it out of the bag. The directions were unclear on how to use it...and the top popped off while I was attaching it to the catching cup. After this, the pump wouldn't suck properly. I finally threw it in the trash because it just never worked right. Save your money or invest it in a pump that works. I highly recommend Medela."
1,never again,"I bought this pump when my son was born. It did not express enough milk and every time I used it, it would fall apart and leak throughout. With my next child, I will be spending money on a better product."
2,waste of money,"I bought this manual pump after my first one broke, I only pump about once a day... I should have known not to be cheap, but you get what you pay for.. The suction is good at first, but only if you can get all the parts lined up just right. I don't know if I was doing it correctly, but the lid kept popping off as I pumped.. then when the parts get wet after you wash them, they don't fit back together as well. It was VERY frustrating... So I went out and bought a Medela pump and so far it's great... My advice is to spend the little extra money, otherwise you'll be spending more in replacing the cheaper pumps that don't work as well."
1,HATED IT!!!,"This pump is uncomfortable, it does not keep suction well, and does not extract much milk. A friend recommended I get a manual pump for when I travel and this pump sounded good, I have and LOVE the electric version, but the manual is SO MUCH MORE TROUBLE than it's worth. Another annoying point is that it does not fit the same bottles as the electric version so you have to pump into the special bottles and transfer it to whatever you use to feed or freeze. Don't I have enough to clean with a new baby?! It was SO frustrating I threw it away. NOT worth the $20.00."
2,lost suction,"I used it just a couple of times, and the suction just died, impossible to pump anything out. It was faster with just my hands!!!We did assemble, disassemble, clean all the parts, but could not get it to work again."
1,horribly uncomfortable,"I was breastfeeding my son when just a few days after birth the nurses gave him a bottle against my wishes. He never latched on again after that. I still wanted to feed him breast milk but naively thought I could buy just any pump. I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a pump but I should have. This pump was terribly uncomfortable ( I can't compare with other pumps because I never used any others). I never had discomfort breastfeeding but this pump made me cringe every time I used it. The suction was poor and my milk supply actually decreased the longer I used this pump. If you're going to pump, spend the money on a good one."
2,Not what I expected,"I already owned an evenflo electric pump, but was looking for a manual pump for on-the-go (for size and convenience). After reading the reviews for the easy comfort I decided to purchase it. I am very disappointed. I can pump about 4 oz in 5 min with the elec. pump. When it does work, it takes about 5 min to pump 1-2 oz. The biggest problem is that the valve falls out into the breast milk most times while pumping resulting in no suction. At home it is an inconvenience, but on-th-go it's unsanitary. I have to stick my fingers in the milk to pull out the valve. Once it is wet, it doesn't seem to stay in. I am still trying to work with it, but it seems that it makes more sense to travel with the electric pump. Also note that it is not much smaller than the electric pump that I own already, so it's not very compact."
1,WCW,"TNA has Kurt Angle. He is awesome on the microphone and I really, really, thought TNA would get somewheres with this guy. The results? Nothing has changed. Kip and BG tried an ""NWO"" angle but you knew Vince wouldn't bite; Triple H is out and the angle is dead I hope. Christian Cage as the champion is a great, WWE fans were craving that but WWE officals dont listen to fans. The brought in Tomko? What he ever do in WWE? Nothing at all. Im sick of TNA, WWE/ECW. They all have to improve in very different ways. Whats going happen with the wrestling on MTV? It'll probably be a distant memory soon. I mean 30 minutes is a short time to cram in high impact wrestling onto one show. So take your pick of what wrestling you like for now, WWE is #1."
2,TNA = WCW,"My review is based off of watching the PPV Live. If you liked WCW, you will like TNA. I honestly don't understand the hype of TNA. They have some good matches, but mostly all of its talent is underutilized and the talent they use are wrestlers who can't make it anywhere else. On this PPV the Kevin Nash Open Invitational was AWWWWFULLLLLL. Samoa Joe is a worthless talent. What does everybody see in him? Every match it is the same thing. Spike Dudley in TNA? Come on, Spike was only good in ECW and he had to be an idiot to be good. Why did Larry Zbyszko wrestle? The Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting match was horrible. Neither man should be wrestling today. Kurt Angle was the only benefit to the show & main event. I would rather watch the new ECW or Smackdown than tune into TNA or buy another PPV."
5,sick!!!,"Tna bound for glory is Tnas wrestlemania,they had many great matches,the open invatental was one of my favirtes and the monsters ball."
3,Cheap!,"The content of this book is fine, however it is very cheaply produced, a taped binding that will not last very long and the pages are photocopied. For that alone it isn't worth ... The cover is only slighty heavier than the pages. If you can find a second hand or library copy that hasn't disintergrated, read that instead."
1,Untitled,"This book is too dense. Even after I read it several times, I still have no idea how to perform SEA properly"
3,A Decent Start,"Consider this a 3-1/2 star rating. Michael Stone has all the equipment needed for the launch of a successful series; he writes well, he has a good sense of pacing, and Streeter is a likeable character. Unfortunately, one of the key clues in this book is telegraphed so early on that it deprives the story of much of its Aha! quotient. The characters, with the exception of Streeter and his friend Frank, come perilously close to stereotypes without quite falling over the edge into the abyss. I plan to read more of the series, in the hope that the promise shown in this first effort is materialized in subsequent books.Recommended."
4,Simply Divine!,"New Cathedrals are not born everyday. But, they are built to last and when it comes to choosing the art that goes in them, well, I keep thinking of Michelangelo. This is a well-made documentary on artist John Nava and the inspiration behind his tapesteries that reside in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels in Los Angeles. It takes us to Nova's studio in Ojai where we see his original sketches, then travel to the factory in Europe where the images are transferred into woven fabric and shipped back to LA. I especially enjoyed the candid interviews with the every day people(restaurant owner, teacher, etc) who posed for Nava's saints. If you have the chance, visit the Cathedral and take a close look at the fine work. you'll appreciate it more after you watch this doc - simply Divine!"
2,Not the best quality,"If you go online and look up the artist C. Allan Gilbert and the original drawing done in 1892, you will see a huge difference between this print and the prints done by Life magazine. The better quality drawings have more detail in the skull head - like a chandelier just above the woman's head. I guess this isn't a bad price, but if you want a copy of the real drawing, you can probably find one at a similar price."
2,Not worth the price,"This print is a nice piece, don't get me wrong. However, you could print this from a fair quality jpg found online, on some nice sturdy card stock. The actual picture is only a little smaller than 10""x13"". The rest is just white border. I don't think $15 plus shipping is a reasonable price. Its not like the artist is making anything on this anymore.Pros: The packaging was good. Adequate protection with no flaws. Like I said it's printed on sturdy card stock-like paper with no gloss which I find to be better than poster prints because it doesn't reflect the light and obscure the image. Suits the black and white.After seeing the product I would, in retrospect, have chosen to print it out myself or have my local print shop make one up for me for cheap."
4,Great,I find that this product makes Mass Tax so much more enjoyable. I don`t like doing taxes but using this product makes them fun.
3,Better than pencil and paper.,"This is my third year using the State version of TurboTax and my fifth year with the Federal version. If you made a big gulp and installed the federal version inspite of the product activation scheme then I would get the state version also. If you bought the deluxe federal version the state version is free after rebate.I have to give the state version three stars because it lacks a lot of the help features that come with the federal version of the program. For example, in Massachusetts you have to break down interest and dividends for inclusion into various tax brackets (it's worse than the federal form) but TurboTax gives very little help in figuring out what goes where. (May be other state versions are more helpful). Still, it is a lot better than the pencil and paper method. If you can take the product activation scheme then this is worth using."
1,Thank goodness I read the review first!,"I need to file in three states, and I foolishly assumed that a ""45 multi state"" package would do 45 states. It will do only one. Intuit's response? ""Yeah, it'll do 45 states, just not all at once."" It reminds me of the old joke about the shop keeper which had the sign that said ""open 24 hours"". When he would close he would tell people ""Yeah, we're open 24 hours. Just not in a row.""YOU HAVE TO BUY TWO COPIES TO DO TWO STATES. Very misleading."
1,Tuebo Tax Deluxe,"I have been using turbo tax deluxe on my dell lap top with windows ME for the last 3 years. This year intuit decided to add request codes and activation code so you can not use you disk on any other computer except the first one that you used it on. This is a great idea except certain version of windows will not let that info out to a software program such as Turbo Tax. Trying to contact customer support, no help, or technical assistance, spent over an hour,just gives your the run around and now its been a month and I still can not access the program I paid for"
4,NEW GROUP,"Maybe these guy have been around awhile, but this it the first I've heard of them. Got the disc today and let it play. Rather enjoyable. Reminds me a lot of the style of the Canton Spirituals. And that's not bad company to be in. After hearing Bro. Castro sing about losing his job, I now have to order the video. Take a chance on these Brothers. You won't regret it. Now, let me give In This Place another listen."
4,An useful toolbox,"R.Dilts provides an useful toolbox to master presentations.In fact, the most interesting part of this book is about how to project a good presentation.R.Dilts through Walt Disney's genius strategies indicates which skills improve focusing on the goals of a good presentator.Let's get on a bookshelf!Lorenzo Gatti- Anticipa Communication"
5,Great great CD.,"A great CD. While Elliott Smith fans DEFINITELY won't be disappointed (there are a couple songs in here that are better than a lot of his solo work, especially my favorite, the untitled track), there's a lot more here. Neil Gust has some great songs here too. While they're not very Elliott Smith-like, they are great melody-driven songs bordering on punk. Great CD. :)"
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"The first two Heatmiser albums are excellent. Real Alt-Rock at its best. Elliot Smith was suited to play heavier tunes too. But on this CD, it's obvious he was pushing the band toward his lighter acoustic vision (which I also love, but not in this context). Instead of sounding like Elliot Smith tunes pumped up, it comes off as Heatmiser songs watered down."
3,late but well compensated!,"The item itself was in perfect condition, but it ended up being severely late--the first problem i've ever had with amazon. however, i was kindly compensated with another one shipped free and a ten dollar gift certificate--so i really can't complain!"
4,under-appreciated,"This is a really good album. The songs move and flow together in a calculating way. I am not a real big fan of Smith's solo stuff (crucify me now), I have always enjoyed Gust's contribution's as well. Together they make Heatmiser a band that can can write down some really nice music. This is a great final chapter to a good band. Check out Dead Air and Cop and Speeder is you want a little more grind."
5,WOW,"This is truly an amazing album. If you love music, you will love this. If you like Elliott Smiths' solo music, you will love this. PLEASE: If you don't like this, consider donating your eardrums to those in need."
4,Good Product for young boys with braces,"Very good products for young sporty active boy (my son is 12 y/o). He said he liked the extra safety that he has now with full contact sports. The breathing though is another story. He said he has to take it out every little now and then to get a good breather. All in all a good product, but has to come up with a new way of breathing while in mouth."
4,"Great product, great price","While I have only used the product a handful of times at this point, I have always had difficulty with mouth guards tot he point of violent gag reflex in response to the apparatus. However, with this piece, I have not encountered any of these issues, especially once I perfected the fit. There is still of bit of discomfort in the anterior areas, but nothing that I likely cannot fix by re-fitting the piece again."
1,Poor quality,I followed instructions wrote in english and spanish because for logic reasons related with my low level english. I put in hot water for around 10 seconds the product and the final result was a sticky mass. Part of one of the edges became amorphous.
2,It's apparent why most of the band left after this one,"The Pacific Age, while not completely devoid of substance, finds OMD watching the cutting edge fade in the rear view mirror, replaced with slickly produced pop that struggles to be relevant. ""The Pacific Age,"" ""The Dead Girls,"" and ""Southern"" are standout tracks. ""Forever (Live and Die)"" with lead vocals by Paul Humphreys is charming and melodic but maybe not as compelling as some of his older songs like ""Souvenir"" and ""Never Turn Away."" Those four tracks would have made a four-star EP, but instead those songs are bundled with a larger amount of filler, from the annoying, throbbing disco of ""We Love You,"" to obvious throw-away tracks like ""Stay,"" ""Goddess of Love,"" ""Shame,"" and ""Watch Us Fall."" Out of all the releases by OMD's original lineup, this is definitely the weakest."
5,Enchanting!,"It's a fluffy title, but the songs on Pacific Age get in your head and demand to be replayed. They are well written and performed and have held up well over the years with many rememberable lyrics and strong hooks that cause me to put the disc back in the player for another listen."
4,Is this worth your scarce pennies?,"Yes, yes it is. This album is a revolutionary compilation of the worlds finest rock and metal! It holds a deadly cocktail of angry rock like Disturbed with 'Stupefy' and the harmonious indy sounds of Placebo with 'taste in men'. The greatness doesn't stop there, it takes you back a few years to the angry voice of Zach De La Rocha with 'Bullet to the head' and to the amazing party noise of Reef with 'Place your hands.' This album is amazing, I strongly advise any of you angry young rickers like myself out there to buy it, it'll change your life!"
3,"Fun Movie, Bad Transfer","I watched these movies when I was a teenager and I liked them. I thought they were funny movies. Anyway, going to the product itself:This is a decent purchase for anyone who wants to have three movies for the value of one. You get 3 Blu rays inside one blu ray case. The video transfer of the first movie is horrendous. The other two movies are acceptable.If you want to demo the power of blu ray to your friends, these movies are not the way to go to impress them. However, if you want to get high and laugh with your friends out of sheer stupidity, this is a highly recommended set."
5,"Valencia, CA","Outstanding! Many a night we have gone to the video store in search of the latest releases only to find that they are all checked out. This finally ends our frustration. Tatham opens the eyes of the consumer and shouts at them that there are hidden gems on those dusty shelves marked ""comedy"", ""drama"" and ""action/adventure"". He also makes it almost (and I mean almost) palatable to rent a movie with subtitles. His acidic commentary on not only the plot summaries but also the genre of the films he is recommending is ""laugh out loud"" funny. It makes you wonder why the television networks aren't using this guy to lift their I.Q. demographics. 1001: A Movie Odyssey is a must have for the cinema connoisuer. It's a video bible. This should be handed to you right after they cut your umbilical cord and slap you in the (...)."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Can't imagine why author was ever considered worthy of publishing such a listing. Basically, a useless reference book and I stretch to use that term."
5,I wish Glenn Danzig would reunite with the Misfits,this cd is truly freakin amazng!She and Hollywood Babylon r my 2 favs the whole thing rocks Great buy no filler kicks major a**
3,poor sound quality,"The music is awesome, but what a terrible sound quality! Get another Misfits cd instead. This sounds worse than your old cassettes."
5,this is one of the greatest misfits cds ever,"I like the misfits a lot, and this definately has the best stuff they did with danzig. Collection 2 isn't that good, but this one is awesome. Buy this one along with ''Famous monsters,'' and ''American Psycho.''"
3,Good for a New Misfits Fan,"Going out on a limb, I'd say every song on this compilation is amazing. But its still a compilation. If you've just discovered the Misfits, this (along with Collection II) is a good pickup, otherwise, buy ""Walk Among Us,"" ""Earth A.D.,"" ""Static Age,"" and ""Legacy of Brutality."""
5,KICK ASS HORROR/FIEND PUNK RocK!,"Could possibly be the best punk rock album i have ever heard! It has an even better collection of songs then part 2. the best songs are ""i turned into a martian"" ""astro-zombies"" but all the songs rock, if you like horror or sick stuff youu will love the misfits. they are horror but not crappy goth. MISFITS KICK ASS"
5,I Wish I Could Marry This!,The title says it all. This is the epitome of amazing! It may not be the number ONE Misfits album/etc but it's in the top!
5,greatest greatest hits album,"this is the best collection of Danzig-era misfits material. This is a great starting place for anyone interested, in fact static age might be better, as long as you don't get american psycho or famous monsters first. It was Danzig's band after all."
5,Misfits rule!,"This album is unlike anything else, unless its by the misfits.Some of the versions of these songs aren't as good as others I've heard, like teenagers from mars.Its still interseting to hear different versions so buy this even if you already own most of the songs on their other albums.We are 138!"
5,The best of Misfits,"This album could be titled The Best Of The Misfits, as it contains nothing but the very best songs of this great punk band. If you think Blink 182 and GreenDay are true punk bands, correct your misunderstandings by listening to this album -The Misfits were real punk, unlike the waterdowned, MTV psuedo-punk bands so many people mistakenly like. This album is one of the most important punk albums ever made."
2,Good for anyone has never written some code,"""SOA is only a concept"", This is the only useful line in the book once you are a programmer.If your job consists in saying many unconcluding words at your job meetings, maybe this book has something to teach."
2,Not for a Developer,"Note: My strong dislike of this book probably says more about me than the book...As a developer I like books that bridge the technical and the business gap. I need to see, in concrete examples, how things might be implemented -- I want to see code, configuration documents, snippets of policy code etc. I also find it helpful when books build upon a sample application. I wanted to see examples of the technology that enables SOA, walk-thrus of standards such WSPL.This book has none of that. To me it is a book of high-level lists of lists and every section I've read leaves me wondering what it said. I think they repeat themselves too much and the book seems poorly organized with material half way through a chapter which seemed to me to belong at the start. For all it being high-level, they make an assumption that the reader is familiar with a host of acronyms and/or the technology behind them."
3,I've never seen tweaker mexicans before....,"Low budget mexican film. Usually in low budget mexican films, there is some hot looking latinas that you enjoy watching. Not too much here. There's a couple good looking women, but one of the main actresses looks like a major tweaker...Some good sex scenes which are usually cut into with violence or drug use. Some hardcore close up stuff, but you can totally tell its fake pieces meant to look like human parts...I can't tell you anything about the story line... Its all in Spanish with no subtitles...You can check out mrskin.com for skin reviews."
4,This one grows on you,"Previously, my review of Silver Sun's ""Neo-Wave"" was the lowest (3 stars) on this page. Several months later, I would have to say that I was far too hasty in my assessment. This is one that may take some time to grab you, but be patient. Now I think it's vintage Silver Sun. If you don't know Silver Sun, trust me, they're a best-kept secret in America at least (the British and Japanese already know them well)."
3,Neo-Wave isn't as strong as the debut CD.,"Silver Sun's latest release is not as strong as their debut CD ""Silver Sun"" but will be worth having if you really like the first CD a lot. In short, the new sound isn't as classically ""Brit-pop"" as the first, which is not surprising when one considers that Brit-pop peaked in 1996."
3,Not for small hands!,"For the price, it is a decent knife. However, I am a woman with small hands (size 7 gloves) and therefore, small fingers. When using the ""pinch"" grip, this knife gives me a blister on my index finger and is very uncomfortable to use. Also, it's definately not the sharpest knife straight out of the package and feels un-balanced to me, due to the large bolster.If you have large hands and are just beginning to learn how to use a ""chef's knife"" and are intimidated by extremely sharp knives, this may be for you. I have other Rada brand knives (paring knife and tomato knife) that I really enjoy and they are good quality. Also, if you are someone who avoids products made in different countries (ie: China)all Rada brand knives are made in the U.S.A."
4,"Skeptical at first, but WOW! I really love this knife!","So I read the reviews, everyone seemed to really love this knife. I loved that it was ""made in the usa"", it was affordable and had great reviews. When the knife arrived, I was totally disappointed, it didn't appear very well made (the reason I only gave it 4 stars), it just didn't look finished. The handle had a few sharp spots, it was extremely lightweight, needless to say, I was concerned. We have had the knife a few months now, it has become the favorite in the drawer and is fought over at the prep of nearly every dinner. The sharp edges have worn down, the blade holds a sharp edge and we have all become accustomed to the weight, which is surprisingly well balanced. I am very pleased with it today and have just ordered a couple more pieces to add to my collection.My only recommendation to you, be sure to get the rada sharpener to go with it, it makes sharpening this knife simple."
2,Rada Paring Knife,I have had a couple of Rada paring knives for a couple of years. The handles now leave my hands black.
3,Knife,It is a good knife unfortunately it was bigger than my rack slot and I can't access it quickly...but that was my fault for ordering this size!
2,"questionable, at least for my use.","The product was well made and appears as original. BUT, I have a 1980 Shay (1929 Ford replica) and the running gear is all Pinto and the cable was about 12"" shorter than the original. So maybe I was mislead but the fittings were identical and looked great----------but too short. Maybe Pinto had other applications, but that was not mentioned in the order form."
5,El Che es guía a la acción por HOY no una leyenda sola,"Este folleto explica que el pensamiento como guía a la acción de Ernesto Che Guevara es más relevante ahora que siempre, dado la depresión económica mundial que ha comenzado ya, que nos ofrece la gente de trabajo más guerras, más desempleo, más incertidumbre. El imperialismo yanqui y las otras potencias imperialistas están conduciendo una marcha hacía fascismo y guerra, incluyendo hacía una tercera guerra mundial grácias a sus rivalidades; la autor explica cómo la perspectiva de Che puede ayudarnos a derrotar ese marzo hacia barbarismo y construir un ""mundo mejor"" mediante conquistar el poder estatal. A veces, este titulo no está disponible en amazon ( dice "" not available on amazon"") pero siempre se puede comprar de booksfrompathfinder""; imprime el frase ""new and used"" encima de la pagina al lado del titulo del libro."
4,A decent textbook,"I found this textbook to be useful, not it was not the best. If this is your first read on journalism, I would recommend this book. If not, look for something more advanced than this."
5,Just... enlightening!,"The most powerful thing in this book is that, more than the life and teachings of enlightened masters -Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar, Yogananda among others- it is a story about a human being who soars spiritually and reaches God (or the Ultimate, or whatever name you want to label it with). This is the account of what every man can reach, and will ultimately be called to. It's a masterpiece of hope in man and mankind. Must read."
5,Fabulous book!,"This is an amazing book. There are so many interesting accounts of not only this man's life, but short accounts of others' he met in his life. You'll learn a lot - fascinating. For anyone interested in India and Eastern religions."
5,"Amazing Book, Super quality Print","For the ones who are really looking for answers, For the ones who are asking the questions. This is a must read"
1,Judas was to Christ as Kriyananda is to . . .,"It never ceases to amaze me that the outcast Donald Walters continues to steal SRF's works from the organization founded by Paramahansaji, and uses Paramahansa Yogananda's name to further his own ego and his purse. But, this is the world of relativity after all.Walters once talked to some SRF monks after he returned from India around 1960. He said he had gone to the famous clairvoyant place in Banaras where they have the Akashic Records. He said that his ""karmic scroll"" foretold that he would either attain liberation in this life time, or he would leave his Guru. Don't need to be a clairvoyant to see which path he took.Purchase Paramahansa Yogananda's works from the organization he founded and gave all his works to, the Self-Realization Fellowship, rather than from this con-man, a.k.a., Swami Kriyabanana."
5,A great book!,"I read this book last summer, but a more recent edition. This copy is the original 1946 version. At my first read, I didn't realize that this was the case or that there might be a difference in the versions. I am enjoying my second read, especially keeping in mind that this is the original version. It is said to be a classic in religious literature. Throughout my first read I could not suspend my disbelief at some of the stories Yoganada related. This read, I took the advice of a friend and am reading the book as if it were an adventure novel. I am trying to let my rational, scientific self just enjoy Yogananda's story telling, humor and insight."
5,Amazing Book,"I read this book not expecting much, and not expecting to finish. Wow, what a life-changing read. This book showed me how to use the tools I have in my spiritual toolbox to greater affect. In addition, this book gave me several new tools, including understanding the control of energy at an atomic level. While I cannot do it presently, I understand now that it can be done. Great book, great read, great insight, great understanding. A Gift From God!"
5,Fantastic Book!,"Excellent book, absolutely fantastic read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you haven't read it, then DO IT!!! You will not be disappointed!"
5,Beautifully profound.,A great work and historical masterpiece. If you are new to spiritual writing this is the perfect introduction. I wish I had had the chance to meet him but alas I was 40 years too late. Like to visit the ashram in LA from time to time.
1,Not a real autobiography,This book is full of superstitious stories and I was severely disappointed. I went into it looking for insight on inner peace and understanding. What it gave me was a bunch of superstitious garbage.
2,Too Much Fantasy,"This book was highly recommended by a friend as something that would change my life. I expected something else. The author lost me in the first chapters with his descriptions of people seeing and talking to gods, reading minds, predicting the future, levitating, teletransporting, appearing in two places at the same time, fighting tigers with their bare hands, amongst other fantastic stories. Just a little bit too much for me, a long time atheist.Other people might have a kick out of it, not me."
2,An Autobiography,"Good Autobiography, but i received no inspiration from the reading. Didn't finish the book."
1,Complete Garbage,"This ebook falsely portrays one of the greatest charlatans of the 20th century in a positive light. If you are looking for the truth regarding eastern mysticism you won't find it here. It is such a shame someone who lead so many people to hellcontinues to be held in reverence by anyone.If you are seeking enlightenment seek GOD through prayer and Bible study. Wisdom is a gift of the HOLY SPIRIT. The Bible contains perfect wisdom through the ages. It has answers to ALL life's problems. The Bible is a gift from GOD for our betterment, to impart Divine instruction, correction, reproof and edification. Amazon has a good translation free - the English Standard Version.JESUS is the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one gets to the FATHER except through HIM. Seek HIM!"
3,Great guitarrist makes the album worthwhile!,Nuno plays amazing guitar. He is one of the best. But that is not the only quality of Extreme. There are some real good lyrics on this one.
2,A promising start... but the band grew up to the better,"This is a typical debut album for a band that, in its beginning, wanted to be a hardrock band.As a big fan of the two follow-ups to the Extreme album, Pornograffitti and III Sides To Every Story, I bought this one out of curiosity. And it IS a debut album. No less - but no more either.Most of the songs are very much alike, so after a third of the CD, you've heard it all. It only reaches historical value for Extreme fans (like me).There's a little too much of childish lyrics about schoolboys which, OK, gives the album a kind of theme. But luckily, both the band and its music grew up after having released Extreme. And they grew up to the better!The highlights on Extreme are the rock ballads like Watching, Waiting and Rock A Bye Bye, and in other songs, there are some pretty good guitar solos as well."
5,One of the best pop albums ever!,"Colin Vearncombe (Black's real name) shifted truckloads of his first album 'Wonderful Life' but he was too good to be commercially successful for long and none of his later albums got anywhere near that early success. That doesn't stop you finding out what you've been missing!Some people prefer his third, eponymous, album, but I've always loved 'Comedy'. The ten tracks are miraculously both perfectly produced and full of emotion. They're beautifully written too, and speak volumes with titles like 'You don't always do what's best for you' and 'You are whatever people say you are' a bit reminiscent of The Smiths.Most of the tracks are uptempo, like the excellent 'I can laugh about it now' and 'I was right you were wrong' but there are some great (scary!) downbeat moments: 'No-one, none, nothing' and 'Let me watch you make love'.Final thought: 'We're all in trouble - is there room in the sky for all of us angels here on earth?'"
3,"Hey, this CD is different from the original tape release","I am looking at the original cassette tape of ""Comedy"" by Black and the most obvious omission on this new CD release is the re-recording of 'Wonderful Life' which, in my opinion, is a much better rendition than the original recording. Also missing from the original tape are 'Sweetest Smile' and 'Reunion'. I don't understand why one would tamper with perfection. I was very excited to see the release of this CD; however, I was very disappointed to see the realignment of the tracks. 5 stars to the original cassette. 3 stars to the CD."
4,"Slight Ozu, not ""second-rate"" Ozu","With all due respect to the previous reviewer, I do not belive that Ozu has ever made a ""second-rate"" film. Good Morning is cheerful and slight, but it is a charming comedy of manners, and is a refreshing change of style for a director much more well recognized for his domestic serious drams on meditations on life and the transience of human existence. I will agree that it quite does not pack the punch of ""I was Born but.."", but is is very charming and entertaining in its own way. I am glad that Ozu was able to leave us with the beautiful swan-song ""Autumn Afternoon"" shot in lovely color, as a fond remembrance of his genius."
3,Second-Rate Ozu,"This is Ozu's first color film made in 1959. Although it is pleasant enough it is basically a watered-down version of his silent masterpiece ""I Was Born But..."" Slight, light-weight and mildly amusing but not up to his mostly excellent body of work. Buy the silent instead or anything else availbe from Ozu."
3,"Nice, but Slow","Admittedly, this is the only Ozu film I've seen. But I do have an opinion on it.The film eventually adds up to something, a slightly interesting meditation on the nature of small talk and personal happiness. But it's too slow a journey along the way. I had to watch the film in about 5 runs, I kept drifting to sleep along the way. Also, the stuff about the kids' digestive systems and the one who kept soiling his pants was very strange, it must be something that really does not translate from Japanese culture to other viewers."
3,too loose,I really love this shoe. Sooo cute! But when I tried it on it was really loose which made it hard to walk in.
5,Huss does it again!,"Dave Huss writes book for the rest of us! Not the professional photographer, graphic artist, or computer expert. If your Christmas shots of the grandkids look like they all have food poisoning, this is the book for you, even if you don't have Photoshop Elements! I use CorelPhotoPaint for picture maniuplation but Dave has advice and tricks here you can use with any bitmap manipulation program. His tips about how to use your digital camera alone are worth the price of the book! Of course, it you do use Photoshop Elements, this is a must have, and, it is fun to read!"
5,"Vincent Caprio-Easton, CT","I loved the energy of this book and felt great empathy with the main character as she struggled along her path to enlightenment. I would recommend it to any reader who enjoys a good tale, a bit outrageous and often bigger than life."
2,There are better...,"I do not have this book - I have the 3.3 version so my reveiw is based upon that book, but from what I can see of the cover (same as 3.3) it looks like this author just updated the commands for the newer version. Regardless, the book for 3.3 was horrible. If you have never worked with ADT before, this is NOT the book to start with. Even though is proclaims ""fundamentals"", without a basic understanding of how ADT works and where the tools and commands are accessed, you will quickly come to use this book for anything but a guide.Also, the price is *outrageously* high for something that was obviously thrown together on a word processor with little images pasted in.Steer clear of this one and try one of these: Edward Goldberg's 2004 book (good), Paul Aubin's 2004 book (the best I think for all levels) or William Wyatts 2004 book (haven't used yet)."
1,Let the buyer beware . . .,"This is more a review of the author's tactics than of the book, which I don't have. I find it egregious that the author ""reviews"" her own book, giving it a five-star rating in an apparent attempt to pull up her average rating - which even so is only 2.5 stars.Her defense is also unconvincing. She criticizes the two negative reviews as being written by CAD novices, but I see no indication of that in either review. In fact, one calls himself an advanced AutoCad user.I give this book one star to cancel out the author's ""review"" of her own work. I also hope someone at Amazon is monitoring these comments and will delete both hers and mine to restore the integrity of the review process."
5,The Feelies' Third Masterpiece,"The Feelies have three incredible albums under their belt. Crazy Rhytms, their first album, has and incredible sound with some of their best songs. It is my favorite of their albums. Their second album, The Good Earth almost equals their first album. Only Life, their third album, is between The Good Earth and Crazy Rhytms. It's their second best. It's worth buying just for the cover of the Velvet Underground's What Goes On. It also has some of the Feelies most melodic and best songs. My personal favorites on the album are It's Only Life, Too Much, Higher Ground and Too Far Gone. Al the songs are great. I would strongly reccomend picking up all three of their albums."
3,Not great . . . but good,"I read this book to my seven year old son after reading the original Peter Ban by James Barrie. My son enjoyed most of the book . . . I found myself skipping over several of the Peter Pan and Tiger Lily encounters as I thought this inappropriate for a children's story and even took away from the innocence of childhood. My son enjoyed the ""answers"" to some of his questions from the original story and usually begged me to continue reading as we read one to two chapters each evening. I, on the other hand, thought it was ""just okay"" -- not as magical as it could've been. I would've liked to hear more details about the fairies and more of the ""fun"" of childhood and of playing games, etc. I would, however, recommend it to other parents of children who liked the original Peter Pan book or movie and who want some answers."
3,Rushed to print,"This shows signs of being rushed to print, including obvious typos in the printed text. Conceivably, these were O'Brian's typos in his typescript and the publisher diligently reproduced them, but that seems unlikely at best. It's also disappointing that the publisher couldn't find someone to transcribe the final pages of the handwritten draft reproduced here; presumably time and money were issues."
2,"Better than Hornblower, but--","The Aubrey/Mathurin series is better than the Hornblower novels. But unless you are fanatical about the series, don't buy it."
3,Loved this series,"I enjoyed this series and didn't want to see it end. I learned a lot of history while reading it. Unfortunately, the unfinished work was more of a tease. I use a Kindle and I couldn't read the hand written manuscripts so it was very short for me."
3,unfinished it is,"just a beautiful unfinished torso of a novel that could have opened a new chapter in the Aubrey-Maturineid.I quite resented the editors' choice of leaving the final handwritten notes in fac simile, instead of typing them the way one would take for granted six centuries after Gutemberg.O'Brian's prose reads smoothly as ever , but his handwriting is above me.Oliviero Fuzzi"
3,The Last Bit,If you followed and enjoyed the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Maturin you would feel the need to read what could have been their last adventure. The book includes the last few pages Patrick O' Brian wrote before his dead in a (difficult to read) facsimile and its transcription. It's not enough but at leas we are able to see one last time Jack and Stephen and the old Surprise.If you are not a follower this is not for you.
3,The Unfinished Voyage,"Bought this for the Kindle. The story, as far as it goes, is typical O'Brian mastery of the novel. Would it do me any good to complain that he died before finishing it? But the photocopies of his manuscript pages are unreadable on the Kindle. Maybe I could read them on the PC, but I wish that the description of this offering had included the warning that the print would be SO small. And since the raw manuscript pages are presented as a picture (not text), changing the presentation font size on the Kindle does not help. Just a warning, not a serious complaint!"
5,Farwell,"This final unfinished book is not up to the standard of Patrick O'Brian's previous Jack Aubrey books, of course,but it helps give closure to the series. And a very sad farewell it is, indeed, to those fictional characters which had become alive and endearing to so many of us."
5,Alas,"The final exploits of Aubrey and Maturin. As other reviewers have mentioned, the manuscript beyond the typeset pages are very difficult to read as Obrian's handwriting is almost impossible to make out. Even with only a partial story and knowing this was the end of the saga it was a pleasurable and poignant read. I recommend this to anyone but only after having read the first 20 books in the series."
3,I wish Patrick Obrien had lived to be 130,I rated this only 3 stars simply because it was only a couple chapters long and those were rough drafts...Oh how I will miss the writtings of Patrick Obrien as well as the narrations made by Patrick Tull. Both men passed on way too soon
4,Buya hard copy of the book not the ebook,"The manuscript at the end is illegible on my eReader. Having gotten a hard copy from the library, it is still hard reading as Patrick O'Brian's penmenship is difficult to read. I LOVE HIS ""GIFT of words"" to the world...and I will again begin sailing through his 1-20 novels, again and again. May you, too, enjoy his gift."
1,21 Without Simon Vance,"Having wasted my money on this product, I now know why you go to great lengths to conceal the reader, who is not Simon Vance and can not be listened to. Utterly disappointing."
5,The Final Voyage,"Truely Patrick O'Brian's final voyage. After reading the 20 book set I went into mourning while reading the 21st. I have never been so attached to a group of characters as Aubery and Company and of course to their creator. The 21st book, O'Brian's hand written draft was very personal... and very sad. It is one of my most treasured books."
3,Requien for Aubrey/Maturin,"This work is only for the most dedicated of O'Brian fans. Substantial portion of conclusion not type set. Reader must rely upon deciphering O'Brian's handwritten hieroglyphs (no easy task) which requires a great deal of time and dogged perseverance.However, the artistic rendition of Surprise in mourning, with yardarms, ""all ahoo,"" may more than compensate for the price of the book."
3,Reading was bittersweet and at times frustrating!,"This final work of Patrick O'Brian leaves one wondering what could have been if? O'Brian's handwriting is, in places, impossible to decipher and can be frustrating. At 114 pages, many of which are blank or less than half filled, this final installment in Jack Aubrey's life at least provides closure for his quest of seeing his flag raised! I am thankful to the publisher for bringing the material to print, but this is one volume that's better borrowed from the library than purchased unless you wish to complete the set!"
3,"21- wish there was more, of course","Because each book in the series doesn't actually finish until the first few chapters of the next book, this does a fairly good job at closing off Blue at the Mizzen. I bought it just to get closure on the series. The book is thin, and the fact that there's also handwritten copy for each printed page, and many printed pages aren't all that full means it doesn't take long to read. There's maybe only 50 pages of actual story, but it's enough to close things off -- and make you wish he'd been able to write more."
1,O'Brien's 21st,This is pale shadow of the previous books. About 56 unedited pages plus 20 or more illegible script pages. Disjointed narrative. Badly needs editing and put totally in typescript. Only for the most serious followers of Aubrey and Maturin. David Herring
1,a realy sad excuse for a book,"the story was thin. it was poorly put together. an editor for the pubshler should have sorted through the material and made a short story of it. this poor excuse for a book, is total shit and should have never been published."
1,A disappointment,"I believe fans will be terribly disappointed by the last of the series. The three chapters do little to advance the story; the descriptions are colorless, and the dialogue is flat. It is a mere caricature of the first twenty books. The only thing clear is that O'Brian made significant changes between his first draft and the last.As his handwriting is unreadable, the publisher shoould have added a transcription of all the text. As the first 20 books were a joy, this was a labor."
2,Milking a dead cow--greedy and ghoulish,"Books like this are why some authors put clauses in their wills to have their unfinished manuscripts destroyed. Patrick O'Brian brought great joy to millions of readers with his nautical adventures, and it is a thousand pities that there won't be any more from him. But I can't help but view this book from the POV of the writer. If I were him, I'd no more want someone poking through my in-progress works than I'd want my fans surprising me in my bath. I don't doubt that O'Brian fans have been baying the publisher deaf for unreleased works, but this book is nothing but a cash-in, and should never have been published."
2,LACKLUSTER EFFORT,"Through the years, Contemporary Christian artists have tried to emulate the current pop scene in hopes of capturing new fan bases. IMAGINE is Benward's 2000 release, so there's strong ""boy band"" influences prevalent.This is Aaron's only solo release, having recorded a few albums with older brother Jeoffrey. IMAGINE's main problem is its lack of imagination in both the songs and arrangements. Benward's vocals lack conviction or passion. MAKE YOUR MARK and ALIVE are the only tracks that come close to distinction.Contemporaries like Steven Curtis Chapman, Michael O'Brien and Gary Chapman are stronger artists in this area. This is Aaron's final recording before he vanished from the CC scene."
5,Beautiful Babies - Start every day with a smile,This calendar is precious. I bought the 2003 calendar to enter my baby in the contest. The 2004 calendar was even better. The babies are adorable and the pictures are precious. My daughter loves to look at all the diferent babies and it is a great teaching tool as well. A great addition for the nursery or kitchen.
1,Got a lemon?,"After putting on the new string for 2 weeks, around less than 8 hours of practice, it appeared worn out and has poor quality of sound already."
4,Eyecatching,Love these bookends.....very novel and an interestingbit of whimsey on the bookshelf. The figure is welldefined and its ghostly self passing through severalbooks is incredibly charming.Most bookends today aren't very heavy and that is aregret generally as well as with these. One has to takecare which books are being bracketed; not too large orheavy.
2,Fine product arrived broken,"These bookends were a Christmas gift for my brother. I opened the box before wrapping the gift to find that one of the figures had broken free from the bookend. There bookend was scratched from the part bouncing against it during transport. Luckily, I was able to glue the figure back and, since I have some experience, I was able to repair or make the scratches less noticeable.The container and packaging used should have been more than suffient to protect the figures. It was simply not packed carefully."
5,Their best album,"The title says it all, this is their best album, almost every song is a hit, they sound fantastic. Odds are, if you're listening to Giant and considering this CD, it has a song that you heard and really liked. You wont be dissapointed with the rest of the songs."
4,overlooked gem,If you are a fan of ballad laden guitar driven hair spray rock then this is your ticket to flashback heaven...
5,"""I'll See You In My Dreams""","""I'll See You In My Dreams"" is such an awesome song. I can listen to it endlessly and never get tired of it. Beautiful.Does anybody know if there is a video to this song? A friend of mine said he saw the video to it and that it is really awesome. I have been looking for it on the internet and can't find it. Can anyone help? : )"
3,"Some very useful tid-bits - some fluff, too.","Recommend it!A bit of fluff surrounds some really useful information here. It's nice to read how Mr. Dilts applied NLP related learnings to some very famous / successful people in history. The Disney Dreamer/Realist/Critic example struck me as especially life-changing. So simple, yet so important. Take this opportunity to look at life through the eyes of geniuses. A fun trip with some fine lessons!"
1,Nothing left for Left Handed Dreams,"The Literary Group met October 27th to discuss Left Handed Dreams by Francesca Duranti, a rather clunky story retold by a supposedly brilliant self-absorbed Italian-born woman who makes good as an American university professor, but who maintains the lightweight theory that by recording her dreams and confirming that she was born left-handed she can prove how all of our identities are so close to being interchangeable, and once she shares this proof with the world all prejudices will go away. While it is unlikely that Duranti meant the narrator or those around her to be air-heads or air-head codependents, the brightest character in the book is a stray puppy who eats, sleeps, and poops.The group voted the book a miserable 1.2 bookmarks with the humble footnote that if this is Duranti's latest book she should call it quits for writing."
3,"Ask WEA about Hand held, Videotech...","A good CD, but as the reviewer above asked, where is Hand Held, Videotech, Mirror Mirror? Found the answer on the BBC Hitch Hickers Guide site h2g2 (a web attempt at a review of everything). Basically, WEA owned the rights, and has yet to release for a recording. Note - this info was removed a few months ago from the site, so we can hope for a release someday to complement the current collection?"
4,Tora Tora's Big Surprise,"One of the great overlooked bands of the late 80's. Every song is awesome and memorable. I just played this the other day and it still rocks. Stand out songs are Phantom Rider, Loves a [...] and Walking Shoes. Pick this up and you won't be dissappointed. Loud and Raw, just the way to listen to heavy metal."
4,This band should have been huge,"The sad thing about this band is that so few people I talk to have even heard of them. I agree with another reviewer that if this CD had just been released a few years earlier, Tora Tora would have been huge instead of forgotten. There is not a bad song on this CD. Great melodies, and excellent guitar work. Some of the best blues-rock you will ever hear. 28 days and Walkin' Blues are favorites of mine, but you can't go wrong with any part of this CD."
5,Best Metal Group Around,Tora Tora...one of the most underrated groups of the late 80's / early 90's. They are great! This album is a classic. I would love to hear something from them soon.
4,Great hard rock with solid hooks,"This album is just great, I don't know what else I can say about it. ""Walkin' Shoes"", ""Guilty"", ""Phantom Rider"", hell I could just put down every song as the standouts from this release. My only complaint is the crappy production. I hate when the guitars start out loud and proud, and then when the rest of the band comes in they (very noticably) drop the guitar volume. It ends up sounding really amateur on the production end. All that said, this album still kicks major and is well worth a listen if you like good hard rock with an attitude, 80's style. Their second release ""Wild America"" has a much better production and in many ways is superior to ""Tora Tora"", but I still like this one better...nostalgia possibly??? Either way they're both great, buy 'em when ya see 'em!"
5,"Inspiring and perhaps, life-changing.","After reading this book, all I have to do now is think of ""The Mighty Atom"" (a man who could hold back an airplane with his hair!) and I can open new jars of jelly in a snap, move a couch across a room in seconds flat, or even find a needle in a haystack, if I had to. It would have been an honor to know this (extra)ordinary man. Whenever I start feeling sorry for my overfed, overindulged self, I will pick up this book and read from it."
2,Poor recording,"I just received and watched this DVD. Although viewable, both the video and audio are not DVD quality; it appears to have been made from a poor quality video cassette recording. The audio is particularly poor, as it is unintelligible in places.Also, there is no scene selection, so if you want to stop in the middle and continue watching later, you have to leave your DVD player on pause.This humorous story deserves a much better DVD."
2,book of numbers,"very poor quality, it's looks like a copy of a copy. would not recommend anyone to buy this base on the viewing."
3,ok movie,did'nt deliver like I thought it would but very realistic for the times of the 1940's thru 60's
4,Book of Numbers...,"I've waited over 20 years for this flick to finally make it to DVD. Personally, I've liked this movie since I first saw it in 1973.Some may term it cheap, cheesy, weak on the script. I liked the movie enough to buy it - and I still laughed at the appropriate parts.I bought this movie from a third party (on DVD, no less!) for $9.99 (+ 2.54 shipping). You shouldn't pay any more than that for the movie. So, this is your 'heads up!' Be patient, copies on DVD will eventually turn up at a decent price. Get your copy, and enjoy it (I know I do!)Four stars!"
5,A must have for all Brandy fans.,"My favorites on this hot maxi single are... U don't know me like u used to both the edited version and instrumental and the two remix instrumentals of Almost doesn't count. The one thing i love about the two Almost doesn't count remix instrumentals is THA VIBE, and believe me, you can feel it. I ain't lyin. Everytime i listen to them, diverse things like nature and national parks where animals live and that type stuff play in my mind like home movies. If you just sit back and relax and just listen to the sound, you will know what i'm talking about. DJ Premier and DJ Pull did an outstanding job producing these remixes. I bought it at Wherehouse last year, and it is definetely worth your money. R&B and Hip-Hop Instrumentals with awsome vibes do carry your mind off to another place. U don't know R&B like u used to and just when you almost resist the feeling of a vibe and it eventually seduces you to be so into it, almost doesn't count indeed."
4,I love it,"Brandy's other albums have been good, but her new song ""You Don't Know Me"", the remix, is real hot right now"
5,DA BOMB!!!,I've always loved Brandy. She has worked with people that others have only dreamed about. She has made a respectable name for herself....SO STOP HATIN'!
4,Excellent intro to DB Design,"After thumbing through a half-dozen books on data modelling and database design, I finally picked up this book. It is the best intro to data modelling that I've come across yet. I've been playing with Oracle and MySQL for a year or so, but I knew I wasn't going to get very far if I didn't know how to build databases from scratch. This book was the first one I've come across that didn't take on the airs of an academic dissertation. Highly recommended for people who want to build Database Analyst skills."
2,Long on commentary,"Adler is obviously a very learned man and a very successful teacher. I found his argument that listening and speaking were critical skills left ignored by most educational institutions to be very well structured, and, as confirmed by my own experiences, very accurate.That said, I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book and found it a long treatise on oral communications in society rather than a practical book on self-improvement.I did find parts of it valuable, but the aggregate of these parts were only a fraction of the 7+ running hours. I probably would have been more pleased with the paper book version that I could skim, pick and choose."
4,book,"this book was ordered so i could use it in my language arts class at school i found it was a little old fashioned formy 6th graders, but i could use a lot of the suggestions in it."
5,Perfectly complements the book!,"This CD features guided meditations from the book, INNER DIVINITY, by Mara Bishop. The meditations vary in length from approximately 7 minutes to 18 minutes. Professionally produced, the author's voice is clear and soothing. The tracks feature subtle background accompaniments such as nature sounds, light music, etc., which enhance the listening experience. Keeping these on my iPod allows me to ""shift my perception"" every chance I get. (I highly recommend the book by the same name, same author!)"
5,thanos,"the 1st Thanos I bought was original and much lighter, as well as the gem showing, but the re-released Thanos is much darker and does not see as eye popping as the original but its what it is and still is a great figure to own, it still looks amazing and great, Just wish Death's face didn't look like some doll, and the gems on his gauntlet shinned a little more with a lighter color and possibly blend the color in a sphere around the outside of the gem so it looks like it is glowing."
3,ok,"its a good looking firure, but when i opended him up and start moving him around to test his articulation, his right leg popped right off. it's a ball joint and it broke at the peg, so i had to super glue it and he's pretty much just for show now, stuck in one pose and can oly move his arms and head. but if u get a good one the figures looks good, nice paint and stuff. hope urs works out better than mine did, he come with the death statue, and a second opened hand u can switch his left hand."
5,Before the Pilgrims there was . . .?,"We Conants have been here awhile, but (sic) 1520?! (g -- Roger arrived from East Budleigh in 1624).This is an EXCELLENT resource book. Unfortunately I haven't seen a copy in years and the reprint price appears a bit steep. Maybe the Stanford Library . . . (g)Edmund Conant Perry"
2,The First Half is Missing.,"The title is very misleading. This is only Volume II and starts with the 7th generation, circa 1800. The period from 1520 to 1800 is not covered."
2,Poor Quality Reprint,"Unfortunately, the book is a VERY poor copy -- made before xerox machines! It is possible to make out most of the text, but all the photographs are worthless.Having seen the original (library copy), I asked the publisher if they could make another, higher quality copy with modern scanners. I believe they do no longer have access to the original book. In short, the answer was NO."
4,"Amazing, but Ornette has been even more amazing...","This is a great album, but as other reviewers have noted, Ornette has done better. For example, his colloboration with Pat Metheny, Song X, is far more adventurous, intense, and powerful. This was a groundbreaking album in its day, and it's still really good. The liner notes from the original LP said that Ornette and his double quartet went into the studio, jammed for 37 minutes and 3 seconds, recorded it, and left the studio. The fact that there is a track called ""First Take"" (literally, a first take of Free Jazz) shows that this is false. Ornette's music was composed for the most part before the improvisation started. Ornette is an amazing musician, and this album is great, but there are better albums by him (Song X, The Shape of Jazz To Come, Change of the Century, and Chappaqua Suite)."
3,Not in their best form.,"First total free album in jazz history. But there are better Coleman's albums. This album is not too convincing. Company from this session is not in their best form. For example Coltrane '64-67 period albums are much better in gravity, cleric and value sides."
1,More like expensive noise,This is garbage - total garbage. Do not waste your money on this CD. That is not to say that Ornette hasn't done some great stuff - just not this. Miles hated it and so will you.
3,hmm,"(quoted from sleeve notes):""he plays a three-dimensional solo - rhythm and speed, then melodic speed, and the two together""""the emotion he uses liberates the rhythms and metres""""...the man who isn't bothered about ""newness"" or ""difference"" [says that] ""he sounds like someone crying, talking, laughing"" is having the soundest sort of response to Ornette Coleman's music.""It's music, but not as you know it. If you like free-jazz - give it a shot. If your favourite jazz track is ""take 5"" then don't go near it. I found this a very hard album to listen to - and I like Captain Beefheart!"
3,Musical Armageddon!,"""Free Jazz"" is recognized as an important revolutionary work that changed jazz forever! It had a profound influence on John Coltrane's pursuit of modal jazz. ""Free Jazz"" is a difficult album to absorb all at once through one listening. The album rambles with chaotic interrupting sounds with no musical structure. I admit that I did not enjoy it and expect my review to be rebuffed by hardcore jazz enthusiasts. For a new jazz listeners, this is not a good album to start with. ""Kind of Blue"" and ""A Love Supreme"" are better introductions!"
3,WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT,"this and i repeat this is not your grandma,s jazz. this is free jazz at its best. It only gets 3 stars cuz it is a short album"
4,"Interesting, emotional","Suprisingly good & original documentary about a foster mother who takes in children with special needs. Nothing is held back, and there is a tear-jerking moment. Glad I watched it."
3,"Worth watching, but...","This is an interesting and worthwhile movie, but it's incomplete. Margaret was left hanging at the end as we're left to wonder about her and her situation which makes the movie somewhat of a disappointment. One can't help but be a little skeptical about Susan's dedication to all her children when she so abruptly brushes Margaret off at a point when she's so obviously in need of some crucial emotional support. The extras give us a cursory explanation of this by the director, but Ben's comments lend insight of another sort.The director dropped the ball by not following up on Margaret."
4,I watched this one with mixed emotions,"You, too, might be wondering (as I did): Is the story of a dedicated woman with an open heart who adopts children no one else will consider? Or is this the story of a very dysfunctional family, including one very disturbed child, one who simply can not be saved? Or would he have been better off in a different family?This movie was both riveting and painful to watch and it was hard NOT to judge the adults in the movie: parents who abandoned their children, showing up for sporadic visits which only caused more pain to their children, emotional ups and downs, tensions and outright breakdowns. And yet, through it all, there was a spirit of resiliance, of hope and of getting a rare glimpse into a real family, with all its flaws and chipped edges."
4,Does the job,"This product seems to be worth the price.It isn't completely care-free, but very close, I rinse and refill it daily to start the vaporizing when I get home from work. It usually has emptied by the time I get up in the morning. (far less than the 40 hours per refill advertised, more like 14 hours) The top is secure, the base is stable. The container is fairly easy to fill, but clumsy to carry back from the sink. (no handle)I'm glad I got warm mist. And glad I spent the small bucks for a vaporizer rather than a warm mist humidifier.Complaint: the product had clearly been used, but was sold to me as new. It works so I'm not pursuing that. But found it odd."
3,Very Interesting.,"Very well written. It has a wonderful plot, and is very descriptive. I can almost see Eleanor myself...... but alas. In this book, Eleanor is a nice girl, but not like the real Eleanor of Aquitaine. The real Eleanor was an adventurous girl, who enjoyed when her father quarreled with the pope. She loved to have knights tilt in her honor, and be praised for her beauty. She loved being the center of attention. This story is very well written as I said before, but it is not the true story. However this story is fun to read."
4,Good Book,"I'd give this book a 4 because a few parts in it were a little hard to understand. This book is about medevil times and Princess Eleanor of Auquitaine. It tells about her life moving from castle to castle, how people cheer for her beauty, and her strong bond with her only livng sibling, Petronilla. Their little brother Willie died when he was 4 because a building collapsed on top of him.Petronilla is Eleanor's 12 year old younger sister. She's carefree, like Eleanor and pretty like Eleanor. In the book but not in real life, Eleanor falls in love with a brave night she calls Clotaire the Strong. But sadly, Clotaire wasn't on her fathers list of sutible husbands.Eleanor's mother had died around the time when Willie died. It hurt Eleanor to talk about it in her book.This book is aa great book for if you like midevil times. It was hard to put down, and when you picked it up again, It was hard to have distractions. A very interesting book."
5,One of my favorite books from The Royal Diaries series.,"Fourteen-year-old Eleanor is the oldest daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine, one of the most powerful men in France in 1136. Her father's only legitimate son died as a young child, leaving Eleanor, the oldest of his two daughters, next in line to inherit his lands, which are larger than those controlled by the King of France. Eleanor knows that because of her position, she will be married off in a strategic alliance. But what she would like is to marry for love, something that's completely impossible. Eleanor records the experiences of her life as a noble girl in Medieval France in a diary given to her by her grandmother. This was one of my favorite books in the Royal Diaries series. I especially loved the Medieval setting. I'd highly recommend this book to all Royal Diaries fans."
2,"A bit interesting, but not very...","After reading Cleopatra by the same author, I didn't have very high hopes for this book. However, while not great by any means, it was mildly interesting. For one thing, I did not know much about Eleanor before the book, and the author did give us a feel of what life would be like in France in 1136. There also was a plotline, but the book ended in a strange place. Not a bad book to read, but not great eithier."
5,Totally Satisfied,"It took me a while to find ""Great Earth, Wind & Fire"" but once again Amazon came through again. I have been an avid fan of Earth, Wind & Fire for many years and all my EWF LP's were destroyed when my house flooded after a terrible storm. This collection has all the selections I wanted. I am so satisfied and the price was right. Thanks Amazon"
4,good disc,Vesta is very talented.her voice reminds me a little bit like Chaka Khan's.Congratulations was the cut.she is very underrated to me.
4,"Gone, not forgotten, 4eva loved!","The rating for this album is for Sweet Sweet Love, And Congratulations! Love, love, love them both! Brings back nice memories. ITunes does not have this album, nor can u get it on mp3, so I had to go old school and get the CD, and its worth it! Vests was a talent of her own...R.I.P"
5,Wow! Intense! Emotional!,"I read the third book in this series first and couldn't wait to get my hands on the first book. Brink of Death starts off with heart pounding intensity and carries you on a wave of suspense to a nail biting and emotional climax. So intense, it brought tears to my eyes! Heartily recommend the other books in this series! - Cynthia M. Hickey, author of Pursued By Evil and A Dream Fulfilled"
5,This book will keep you jumpin!!!,"I finished ""Brink of Death"" in about 3 days, had to sleep some of the time.....The whole book was so great but the last 140 pages had mejumpin(g)through sentences so fast that I had to go back and re-read the paragraphs over again.This is the kind of book I just love and hate at the same time. Love because it is so darn good and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Hate, because it is so good that I read it to fast and it is over, gone, done POOF!!! , and I don't want it to be over. Oh yes, something else. You brought the Lord throughout the whole book so beautifully that as Annie was fighting him and reaching out to him at the same time, you could identify with her easily.I can hardly wait for the next one. I am utterly amazed at the skill and talent you have to put something like that together. Thank you.Winnie"
5,Be Afraid,"Brink of Death, the first book in the Hidden Faces series, literally scared the ba..jeebies out of me! Hold onto your seat and like Brandilyn says....""Don't forget to breathe."" She wasn't kidding. I held my breathe to the very end. I was still thinking about it the next day. It is the best suspense novel that I have read. Lock your doors. Read this book. Be Afraid. You may want to sleep with one eye open."
5,First Impression,"I've been wanting to read Brandilyn Collins for some time and I must say ""Brink of Death"" my a five star first impression on me. There is little to not like about this book. The dialogue is tight and the story proceeds at just the right speed. This story has great timing, never dragging but lingering on detail at times to allow the reader to catch up. I look forward to the rest of the novels in the Hidden Faces series."
2,totally falls short,"This is the second book I've read by this author. The first, Over The Edge, I couldn't put down so I was anxious to try another. Brink Of Death simply is not a very good book . . . the first in a series I won't be reading."
2,Just ok,"If you like murder mysteries, this one is just ok. I could not really get into it, and I tried."
1,Just Awful,"I picked this up hoping for some good escapist fiction while nursing a cold. Sorry, but this was completely unbelievable in every way. Trust me folks, homicide detectives don't discuss cases with civilians and don't drag them along to interviews. Ms. Collins' lack of credibility in her subject matter is further revealed in Sybee's not guilty in the murder trial. If a person is in the commission of a felony such as drug dealing and a person is killed, that person is just as guilty as the triggerman. Annie is an idiot who magically seemed to win in physical combat against the bad guy but lost to a two year old, who incidently had perfect diction.Ms. Collins appears to have very little general education. Perhaps her knowledge of Christianity is better. In that case, maybe she should stick to Christianity as the sole subject. She's not winning converts with her uneducated, ignorant fiction writing."
5,Where is Tamashi,This is the second album featuring violinist/singer Takumi Fukushuma and is easily as good as the brilliant Polyglot which first got me into this band. Guigou Chenevier has again managed to meld together a range of eccentric styles into a highly listenable album which should delight jazz and classical fans as well as those of progressive and alternative rock.
3,"It's ok, but...",I really can't get into this CD. Nothing is really bad about it. The problem is nothing is good about it either. Choose Labour of Love II or stick with Marley and Fine Young Cannibals.
3,cool look bad fit,"Very cool looking sunglasses but, unfortunately, they did not fit me well. There was too much space between the bottom of the frames and my face thus alowing too much sun in. The lenses were not as dark as I prefer. I returned them."
5,great set,My Granddaughtr just loved the set. It is what she wanted. The delivery was fast and got here before the time it said it would. I plan on ordering her the stable to go with it. A good company to do business with.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,I had no idea how realistic or big these pieces would be. We bought this for the Breyer Classic horse sets and it's perfect size. Definitely better to spend the extra bit of money and get these durable life like pieces rather than some flimsy plastic ones that are just gonna get lost!
4,20 year old fantasy flyer,"Bought this about 20 years ago for the son, his room was all about airplanes.This fan moves plenty of air, and looks great for a kids room or aircraft / WW2 themed room.I had to use more ""double sticky back"" tape to hold the wings etc. than was supplied.Now the son is in grad school and the fan has been moved to our summer house in the ""grandaughters room"" still looks and runs great. Use outdoor grade ""double sticky back"" tape to hold the wings etc, works better than the original mounting tape.I've had numerous ceiling fans over the years, and the HUNTER (brand) seem to be the best quality. This fan is unique in looks and runs great."
1,Why so crazy expensive ???,"I was at the Ellis Island ferry a couple of days ago and they sell this plastic ring bound book in their gift shop -- I cant remember the exact price, but it is probably less than $20. I am thinking $15-$17.Why are people selling it here for these crazy prices ? it is not a hard to get or out of print item. It's available to tourists everyday.I hate to see people being taken advantage of."
2,Bitter and Astringent,"I love most of Stash's green teas. LOVE them. Most of them are grassy and flavorful but lack the bitterness of many other brands of green.This is the exception. Blech! It is incredibly astringent, something even more common in Jasmine greens than in a straight green. I recommend trying it from a grocery store before committing to a large Amazon purchase unless you happen to like bitter tea. That sounds absurd to me, but I do have friends who prefer their tea with a bitter bite.TheYamamotoyama Jasmine Tea Bag(which stash also sells, but I couldn't find it here) is flavorful but NOT bitter."
1,Too complicated to use,It didn't even come with instructions. I found a how-to video on line. I still could not do it. Very difficult to lace into a shoe. I called New Balance and no one could help and they admitted they are difficult. I called a running shoe place and they had someone who could help me lace up my shoes but they said they are difficult. I decided to junk them.
2,Small pieces for small dogs,"I purchased the Smokehouse slivers for our two large labs hoping there would be enough size to hold their attention for a while. The dogs like the product, but they could down the piece while standing. This is probably a good product for small dogs, but large labs like our need more substance. The general problem is Pigs Ears have increased in price so much that I can't justify the approximately $1 per ear price I see. Our dogs three several treats a day, I can't afford to keep them in ""ears."""
1,RANCID!,"I bought these based on good reviews for quality and price. However, the two bags I received both have a strong rancid smell. I've bought fresh pigs ears from the local pet store and paid 3-4 times as much, but frankly, I wouldn't pay 1/4 the price for a rancid product ever again. Rancid oils are terrible for humans and terrible for pets. My dog, who usually LOVES pigs ears, picks these up, puts them back down, sniffs them, sneezes a few times, and walks away. Not sure if it was a bad batch or if they are all like this. I bought a big bag from costco that smelled similar, and I returned them. I probably should return these, but it's a bit of a hassle with online purchases. Anyway, very disappointed. Beware. Only good thing would have been the nice, appropriate size for a small dog (Havanese)."
3,Small Pieces,Small pieces and concered about a chocking hazzard. Stick to dog treats that you would not be concerned about an intestional blockage.
5,Loving it,"My dogs have enjoyed these pig ear treats greatly. Arrived in the promised time, will consider reordering in the future."
3,2 out of 7 pets agree!,If you've read any of my reviews you should know I have 7 little doggies with a big appetite for treats! I love spoiling them too. I've seen them tackle pigs ears and have heard they are not good for your dog so when I saw 100% natural and in these more bite-size shapes I jumped on them! Out of 7 only 2 of my dogs devoured them and they are two rescue dogs who are used to nothing and are thankful for crumbs. My at home born and raised other 5 are much pickier. I'm sure these are great but based on my dogs experience I give it a medium not a low score because I believe in giving your pets 100% natural treats and that is where this product did not fall short.
4,Love books,Loved these aas a kid and am now enjoying sharing them with mine. Not to long or short. Good flow to the writing. Like a modern Esops.
4,Great DVD for beginners,The Dvd is great specially if you are starting in bellydance and if you have knowledge already it is always good to revise and practice the basics.
5,dragon fly flapper,"This was purchased as a replacement for a flapper that I accidentally broke. I have not seen it put up yet, but the recepient seemd to like it very much. It came packaged in styrofoam, and arrived without any breakage.Over all, I was very pleased with my order/service."
3,I've Got To Wait For Another Two Books????,"This was my first Brooks' book and I read a couple of chapters and was captured. Then I decided to set it aside until I had read some of his earlier ""Shanara"" books so that I would be more familiar with the world and the setting.I read the ""Sword of Shanara"" trilogy and enjoyed all three. I would rate each as four or five stars.Happily I went back to Ilse Witch to resume reading. About half-way through I could see that the story was not going to end by the book's end. And it doesn't. It leaves you hanging in the middle of a climactic part and now I have to wait for the publication of the next book (and probably the third book), which may be years from now.It was a rousing good story, but I would definitely recommend waiting until you can read all three at the same time. The Shanara trilogy were all independent stories that became tied together. Brooks has not followed that plan with this series."
2,This is where I abandon ship,"I have read everything in the Shannara epic leading up to this novel, and while not blown away, the previous books were entertaining enough to keep me reading. However, this latest installment makes is apparent that Brooks is out of good ideas (flying ships doesn't quite cut it) and continues to repackage even his own stuff. After reading this book, I draw a line in the sand and refuse to spend any more time with Brooks' writing. I can only recommend this with the disclaimer to expect nothing fresh from Brooks here."
3,Wait till the series is finished....,"I love Terry Brooks. Well, I guess I don't 'LOVE' Terry Brooks but I sure do enjoy his books. So, it is with heavy heart that I say that I didn't enjoy this book. I honestly think he could have done it in 50 pages and not 450. The story just is stretched out so far that it really gets dull. On top of that, it is not even a self-contained story. It ends without ANY resolution at all. It reminded me of the Lord of the Rings (but doesn't all of Brook's writing). Anyways, I can say that it is worth the read but I'd wait until the whole series is finished. If you don't it would be like reading the first 5 chapters and then waiting another year to read the next 5."
3,"People consider this book ""Fast paced""?","This is not fast paced. The only good part is towards the end, and the only reason that I even had enough patience to get to the end in the first place is because I was sick with a fever. I wouldn't be willing to ever re-read this book again, and plus it was one event after another, not like twisting and turning plots that encircle each other like every fantasy should have. Plus there was a cliffhanger. I'm not gonna read the second installment in the trilogy, because I don't have enough patience to go through more and more fluff like there was in this book."
4,Great story until the very weak ending!,"I have read many of Terry Brooks books and all of them are written with great attention to story and character development. Ilse Witch is not unlike Brooks previous works in this manner. However, Ilse Witch falls short of being one of Brooks best works simply due to the fact that the ending is non-existant. The reader spends the entire book learning about the history of previous characters and the details of new characters and how they are leading up to a huge battle between good and evil (typical Brooks style). The battle does not occur in this book. The ending fizzles with a note that states that the clash will be detailed in the next book. So after 454 pages of gearing up to the great battle, the reader is left cold and frustrated. It seems as though this book is merely a teaser for Brooks future novel sales. I am thoroughly disappointed in this sort of writing but will undoubtedly purchase the sequel for closure, if anything."
2,Fontana is awful,"This was the first audiobook I ever abandoned on account of the narration. It's already abridged, which is just... pointless, but I dealt with it through the Heritage series. Fontana's idea of character voicing, however, comes across like a middle-schooler making fun of girls, or doing his best evilly-evil voice.Cursory googling suggests this book was the only work he ever got in the industry, and with good reason. The worst part about productions like this one is that they just sit there, discouraging a decent version from ever being made."
5,A good story,"I throughly enjoyed this book. I was hooked from the first page forward. My only disappointment was that it is the first book of a new series. I have read the other Shannara books but not for awhile and found that Terry Brooks has written a brand new story that is easy to read and understand even if you have not read any of the other Shannara series. However, if you have not read the other books in this series, please treat yourself and do so as soon as possibleRecomended, The Price of Immortaliy is a book well worth reading"
2,AVERAGE STORY WITH NO SUPRISES AND RATHER BORING,"The Shannara books have become so generic and formulatic that there are no surprises, no twists, nothing to make it interesting. His characters are generic, usually young adult, innocent who must go into the big world. How about some variety? Now that the Shannara world has been completly explored several books back, the mystery and adventure is gone. So now, in the book we go outside the four lands across the ocean, but do we find excitement, mystery and the unexpected? OF COURSE NOT! The characters go to three islands where some type of guardian attacks them, but the guardian is defeated so quickly and then they move on, so there's no chance of developing the story or sense of adventure. Terry rushes the characters across the ocean to get to mysterious land at the end where the second book and hopefull the story will start."
1,Lost the magic.,"I have been reading the Shannara books since I was 12. Having read the latest offering all I can say is that it is probably about time for Terry Brooks to retire. The story is old, the characters have been done. Let us remember you for the great author you once were, instead of the hack you have become."
4,Clear and Easy to Read!,"I really did like this book, it was different to the other Shannara books as it had more conversing with other characters. I could picture the scenes very clearly and easily in my mind. One thing I didn't really like in this book was that some of the characters that were involved in the first half of the book, in the second half were neglected, when I really wanted to know what they were doing/thinking. But then again there is other books to come out so maybe it will have more info on them later. But all in all a very good read!"
4,Not the best of Terry Brooks,"Don't get me wrong...I love Terry Brooks (most of my copies are autographed), but I don't think this is the best of his books.In reading past novels, you get the impression of a man with a vision of an alternate world. You get the feeling that he took his time to masterfully craft the story. Not here.In a few places in the book, I get the feeling that the author didn't thoroughly reread the work. I don't want to give away anything from the story, but in one instance, a character ""absorbs"" some sickness and passes out. In the next paragraph, someone is going to talk to them. How can this happen with that person being unconscious? Maybe I am nitpicking, but I got this sense in more than a couple of places.I would still read this book and recommend it for all Terry Brooks fans, but this is not a book for the first time reader of Terry Brooks."
2,Weak,"As a fan of the previous Shannara books, I was very disappointed with this one. The plot is weak, the characters undeveloped and the ""Cliff hanger"" ending was predictable. It seemed the author was in a hurry when he wrote it as everything was rushed and glossed over. Not recomended."
4,Only 1/3 of a book (maybe only 1/4),"I thought this book was a great summer read. It had a good pace, an interest concept and likable, if not complex, characters. My only disappointment was that it isn't an entire book, it is just a teaser for the books to come. The book does not have an ending; the book just runs out of pages. I highly suspect that Mr. Brook's book deal states that he needs to write 451 pages per book and that is what he did.The Isle Witch is a good start but if you have a memory like me wait until all 3 or 4 installment have been written, so you can read the whole story."
4,"I like the book, but. . .","I am a fan of Terry Books, and I like this book, but: 1. The book is titled the ""Ilse Witch"", but the character is missing from much of the book. The book is very entertaining when she is present, but drags when she is not. 2. It is frustrating to read a book without a strong ending. Of course, this is a novel which introduces a series. Thus, you expect loose ends. Even so, I cannot imagine a new writer ever getting this book published, because it is an incomplete work by itself. It is only because of Terry Brook's reputation and fan base that he can get away with a novel like this. 3. I agree with other reviews that at certain points, plot events and character motivations are not logical.When Terry Brooks gets going, there is no one better. I anxiously await the next book in the series. But please, Terry, give us the real deal!"
2,An idea whose time has come and gone--a long time ago,"I got this preview from Brooks' webmaster. I was excited to see if his exposure to the creativity of George Lucas might have shaken loose a sense of humor in Brooks, something he has always been severely lacking. The answer: not a chance.Brooks has built a career by ""borrowing"" the creativity of others--Tolkien [Shannara], Pullman [Running with the Demon], Lucas [Star Wars] and now Robin Hobb and some of the other fae-fantasists. While the characters are certainly a little different [for which I awarded an extra star] the writing is the same clunking, lackluster prose he has always had."
2,Whats Happened To Terry?????!!!!,"Terry Brooks has captivated me through his Shannara series, until now!! The Isle Witch lacks the flow of his former novels. It also seems to have been cut to the point where you read and expext more detail on many things but simply dosen't happen. The charachters are not so memorable as his last books made immortal. Truls Rohk is the only charachter I find interesting, the only ""cool"" charachter in the book. Terry Brooks didn't take the time to produce a proper novel, or simply is tired of the series and his imagination and patience has all but left. I am most displeased wih Terry's sudden change and lack of forethought to his writing. Terry went from a top writer to a writer simply ""pumping out a book"". He should be ashamed of this novel, apologize to his fans and strive for the magic he spun from the depths of his imagination that the Shannara series had once been!!!!!!! Shame on you Terry. YOU KNOW BETTER!!!!!!"
1,Giant Eels?! Woot!!!,"I'd never been a fan of Brooks or Shannara; captivating prose is one thing if it steals the scene in the first few pages, but sustaining the thrill throughout the book has never been a strength of Brooks, and in this case the book falls flat on its face. Giant eels? Oh please.The humdrum, cliched 'gathering of the Company' and the hollow characterization play second fiddle to the laughable plot twists however. I bought this book after reading the excerpt, hoping that the author's style had gained some flavor and maturity over time. As it turns out I just wasted my money."
2,Brooks doesn't know when to stop,"The original Shannara were good, Heritage was a nice read, but what is this? Not bad by itself, but read one of his older books and the entire book seems impossible and idiotic. Sorry, but does Brooks know how to not contradict himself?I enjoyed this book, but only because I'm Shannara fan."
3,1/3 the story of the old Shannara,"Any Shannara fan will love this book. If you remember the Shannara books were always complete stories. However, Brooks decided to milk us, seems this is to be a trilogy or something."
2,Shannara Fans Beware,"I have not even finished this book yet, but feel that a warning to fans of the Shannara books is justified. This book does not flow as easily or pull you into its storyline like the other 6 before it did. The writing is inconsistent. Every few chapters feel like the old books but you have to suffer through awkward, empty chapters to get to the good ones. I actually found myself skipping pages looking for familar Shannara content. The purity of the Shannara land has been ruined with technology that was never in the other books. The presence of such technology is inconsistent with the old storyline and has never been hinted at before. The book feels forced. So far, I am very disappointed and am forcing myself to finish this book in hopes that it will improve. As a long-time Terry Brooks and Shannara fan I had been looking forward to reading this book and still hope to enjoy the nostalgia of Shannara."
3,Hmmm. Can't seem to get through it,"I've read the entire Shannara series and then read Tolkein. Now I can't seem to get past the first 50 pages of this book. It seems as though Brooks has extended the Shannara name a little thin. His writing hasn't matured significantly since 'First King' and I seem to be detecting some repeated characterization and even repeated lines out of the original series and the Heritage series. Maybe someday I'll get past it and read the rest of the book, but I'm getting disappointed in the now-stale writing. Read the Landover series if you're looking for more Terry Brooks reading."
3,"Not the best, but still entertaining","Again, Brooks has started a series that requires the reader to purchase sequels rather than writing self contained novels. I'd buy them anyway, of course, I don't think anyone is better than he at making a virtual world come alive without illustration.This one is fairly predictable; from the beginning you can much more easily guess the family connections before you're told them. Then again, Walker Boh isn't Bek's great great great (and then some) grandpa's kind of Druid, so maybe he's a bit more open.I do look forward to the next installment, however, and find it an entertaining read, as always."
4,A good beginning,"I never had the desire to read any of Terry's books, despite the Shannara series being such a success. Ilse Witch happens to be my first of his books. I would have to say that Ilse Witch isn't that fantastic a book. The story development is good but not superb. But the Shannara story is a VERY compelling one and so are the characters in the story. So enticing in fact that it as prompted me to read the rest of the Shannara series. I do believe I have become a fan of Brooks..."
5,Great,"What a great time I had reading this book! Mr. Brooks has yet to disappoint me. It's fun, it's exciting - everything I've come to expect. I nearly cried at the end - not because of the book, but because of the long wait for the next book to find out what happens!~!"
4,Classic Terry Brooks,"This book is classic Terry Brooks styling. The story is compelling, the characters are well developed and interesting, and the world in which the story takes place is well described and maintains continuity. My only real complaint about this book is it seems to drag at the beginning and in the middle. That is to say that the adventure takes too long to get started, and once it does get started, only brief flashes of action interrupt the monotony.For those who have liked other works of Terry Brooks, you will enjoy this one as well. For those who want to get into the world of Shannara for the first time, read Elfstones or Scions of Shannara instead."
2,Not as good as the first,"Remember how Alien3 ruined the end of Aliens? Same deal here. Not a bad story, but it spoils the ""old world"" mystery of other shannara novels."
4,"Good, but took to long...","This was a really good book. Even the cliff-hanger ending didn't bother me (that much). My only complaint is that it took too long to get to the exciting parts (they must have spent 100 + pages preparing to leave!), and then, when the book did get good, the excitement was over too quickly. I did give this book 4 stars, because, overall, the story was good, and I really liked many of the characters. I would recomend this book to other readers, but only those that have already read the other Shannara books. I agree with Phillip Mills-Buuck, who said the the Elfstones book is the best!"
4,AweSomE Book,"HeY this book wAs just awesome!! good content, but the only reason its missing a star is because it was focused to much on one thing that was happening, i like books that has a lot of thoughtful instincts and stuff otherwise it was a pretty cool book, big enough, detailed enough, cost a lot of money for me thoughto bad paperbacks dont come out first!!!!!"
1,"Leaves you with hopelessness, shame, and guilt","Great book up until the ending... without giving it away, you are going to HATE the ending, and it will leave you with a profound sense of hopelessness, shame and guilt. If I had it to do over again, I would have rather not read the book at all, and I won't recommend it."
4,Disappointed in Product Condition,"Purchased so the author (a friend) could sign and I could present as a gift to someone. Product in fairly good condition - not VERY Good - due to stained cover. Not ""gift-ready-condition"" as hoped. It was ""free,"" however, so got what I ""paid"" for! Will advise Proquo."
5,The Only One We Use,"My ferrets are 7 years old and this is the only food they have ever eaten. They are in marvelous health: they have lucious, soft fur; great skin; healthy teeth; they are still playful and their senses are keen. We supplement this with other 8 in 1 products including Ferretone and Multivitamin. Together, we have happy healthy furbabies!"
1,Junk food for ferrets,"My second ferret was being fed this food when I got him. His coat was dull, thin, and rough. I switched him over to my mix (8in1 Ultimate Crunchy, Natures Variety Instinct Duck, and Wellness Core) and he's doing much better.Pros: Ferrets seem to like the taste and it's an interesting shape.Cons: The ingredients are less than ideal- chicken meal, ground corn (bad), brewers rice(bad), corn gluten meal(bad), animal fat(fat is good, but this is unspecified so not ideal), corn oil, dried egg, molasses (why is there a sweetner?) beet pulp (filler).... and so on. Out of the first 6 ingredients, only two are able to be digested. Waste of money in my opinion.Spend a little more on a quality food. You will feed less and your ferret will poop less too."
4,how electricity works,"I teach 4th grade and found this book very good at explaining what electricity is and how it is generated. There are not experiments crowding each page, just clear electron models that clearly explain electricity theory."
4,Not just a philosophical treatise with window dressing,"From all the reviews I read of this book, I was concerned that it would be short on action and long on talk. After all, the setup is not necessarily compelling: two guys hiding out in the snow, trying not to call attention to themselves. It doesn't make for an action-packed plot.Luckily, quite a lot of the book is given over to the two main characters telling their life stories, filling in some of the history of the Meme Wars. Most of the philosophical exposition happens inside this panoramic and engaging context, so it works better than the high school debate-style discussion I feared and expected.Once again, John Barnes has managed to make reading about abstract, high minded concepts be fun."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book more than any others I've read in a while. Barnes does a great job (as usual) of interpreting what the future holds and letting us grab a quick peek.The book is enjoyable, and the 'memes', futuristic viruses, are new, but the idea isn't. The idea of government control has been explored countless times, none better than Orwell's '1984'. But Barnes breathes fresh life into the concept. This time, the government isn't faceless bureaucrats, it's the mind-controlling entity itself.Perhaps what I most enjoyed about this book was the friendship that grew between the hero and the villain. Even though they were on different sides of the battle, they were very similar people.This book is short. Barnes tells his story and gets out. It's a refreshing departure from the commonplace 500 page tomes. This is a great book to read on an airplane. Check it out."
3,Needs more work,"John should take this back and work on it some more. The Kaleidoscope Century ideas are very meme-like in themselves and hypnotically lure this reader, but loose ends, confusing motivations and behavior,abrupt shifts in tone, and way-too-long folksy expositions abound here and should have been corrected. And far too much time is spent on two middle-aged guys digging holes and playing in the snow. I buy and read every John Barnes book, but the last three (including Finity and Earth Made of Glass)have not been up to the standards he previously set. Maybe authors should test-""screen"" their new novels before a sample audience before release, as many film directors do."
1,A Badly Underdeveloped Concept,"This book sets new standards for incomplete character & plot development. According to this book (written in 2000), all the major events in the book were triggered by the outbreak of widespread warfare using highly destructive and sophisticated bioweapons and the societal changes caused by this warfare. No mention is made of how these technologies came to such rapid fruition, since the negotiated peace that ends these wars occurs by 2002! The book then degenerates into generalities about ecological disasters, social decline, and wars between factions dominated by artificial intelligence programs. The whole book lacks focus, and the ending is just tacked on, as though Barnes became tired of writing. A thoroughly bad book, lightyears behind his Timeline Wars series."
2,Nothing special,Not as good as I though from the reviews - Older country type songs on on steroids with a few fair ones/
2,Mostly of historical interest only,"While many of the tracks on this CD have possibilities, indicating some decent songwriting skills, the arrangements are quite sparse and the vocals are just middling. I was hoping this would sound like an early-Eagles album, but Gram just doesn't have the vocal abilities of Glenn Frey or Don Henley and the arrangements and production seem somewhat primitive. I think Emmylou Harris' and Linda Ronstadt's versions of ""Sin City"" and ""Dark End of the Street"", respectively, are clearly superior to the Burritos', for instance. Gram Parsons' main contribution to music must be his songs and his influence on others, rather than his performances."
4,GREAT SINGING BUT CD MASTERING A BIT SUSPECT,The great Dakota Staton's glorious voice is in full force on this live recording. It's such a shame that whoever was responsible for the remastering on this live release didnt take a little more care. Dakota sounds a little like she is singing through a slightly muddy sound system. Thats why I given it four stars instead of the five it would have gotten.The performances are fantastic the vocals awsome the band tight.......remastering could have been a little better. Sadly we have just lost this underated jazz and blues singer to the one above. Ms Dakota may u sing forever in our hearts......
3,Probably geared towards modeler's more than any other group,"While the reviewer above is mainly correct about the book's shortcomings, I thought he was too harsh in giving it just one star.References on this airplane are scarce, I don't have the AIRTime book so this one stands head and shoulders over any of the existing (mostly in Polish) books on the Ju 188. Diagrams straight from the manufacturer's manuals are a great plus for someone looking to model this airplane, photos are very, very crisp and sized generously and the information on the operational record is accurate. As a modeling reference it could have provided more color profiles, but overall, I'm very satisfied with this book."
4,"Faith, Hope and Charity Charm",Very nice charm...good size. The detail on the anchor and cross is pretty. Item looks exactly as pictured.
1,Faith Hope and Charity,"Returned this charm..As I wrote earlier, buy the discs, they are more attractive..This charm is very small..There was no problem, and the people were courteous.."
1,extreme disappoitment,"I was overjoyed to see the song ""The Time will come""....or so I thought it was. there were only 10 songs...NONE were the song I wanted..I was very disappointed when I opened the CD to find it was not the original Planet of Life CD with 15 songs.including ""The Time will come...That's the CD I thought I was ordering. I was taken advantage of, and very much mislead....when i click the actual CD, but when ordering it takes me to another CD,,,,HORRIBLE!!!!!"
3,mom 2 b,"I can only give this seat 3 stars for now due to fact that I have yet to put my baby in it. As soon as it was given to me I was concerned w/ all of the poor comments about installing in a small vehichle. So out to my car, w/in 5 min. I had the base installed, leveled and ready to go,using the seat belt to attatch. The base didn't budge when I yanked on it w/and w/o the car seat attached.(Now of course I read directions before I attempted since I have no clue.) Also my car is a'95 nissan, 2 door, so far there seems to be plenty of space for this seat. Also I read issues w/ the matching stroller fitting into trunks, once again I have a nissan and the stroller fits more than fine in my trunk."
4,Great Product,"We have this product and it works great. We first bought the complete system w/ latch and it fit in our Expadition perfect. It easaly swapped to our Tarus as well. It is very simple to install if you have the latch system. I have yet to try the seatbelt system and would probably vote against using the carrier with a seatbelt. I would rather have the system anchored to the car than hooked up with a seatbelt.I am confused as to one reveiw saying this product does not work. You have to level it out due to the automobile car design, not the babyseat flaw.The one flaw is the sunshade which is poorly designed."
2,newmom,"I recommand that parents check theNational HIghway Traffic Safety Administration http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/The base is very difficult to install, the ball makes noise, and the base is not compatibile with any car. I have contacted peg perego since the plastic parts are falling apart on the base!!!"
2,Base Will Not Install Properly,"I echo Newmom's warning. After reading her review, I decided to try to install the carseat which we received this past weekend into my Subaru Forester. It simply will not fit properly. The problem lies in the design of our seatbelts. They are too thin to fit snuggly in the base guides, and the accessory that came with the carseat to compensate for thin belts is too large to fit properly on the belt between the base and the seatbelt latch. Our fire dept. personnel has recommended that we NOT use this car seat in our car. If you have comparatively thin seatbelts in your car, you might want to think twice about purchasing this carseat. If anyone has other suggestions as to how to make this carseat fit in our car, please post a followup review! Thanks!"
5,Sultry Peggy,An unusual and well produced album of Lieber/Stoller songs from the inimitable Peggy Lee. Full of surprises from blues to Showtunes and Dixie.
1,un trabajo fallido de una gran banda,"Si te gusta el trabajo de Geordie mejor revisa sus dos primeros álbumes: I hope you like it y Dont be fooled by the name.Este disco en particular no tiene nada, no hay coherencia, ni fuerza, tan solo harmonías facilonas y complacientes que son totalmente predecibles.La fuerza del grupo aquí es nula y presentan un trabajo aburrido y muy flojo."
2,Vastly exaggerated adventure,It got quite ridiculous. Superman before his time. I finally couldn't read any more. I did not enjoy the book much.
2,abones80,"I am in complete agreement with the very thoughtful review provided by ""abones80."" This casebook provides a disproportionate amount of questions rather than answers for those trying to glean some grasp of black letter law. On the subject of hearsay, I recommend A Student's Guide to Hearsay by Clifford S. Fishman."
3,Annoying,"Chances are reading this book is not your choice. However, allow me to suggest buying and reading a few commercial outlines and an E&E instead. Talk about hiding the ball. There is almost no specific or clear black letter information anywhere. After the authors pose a problem, they offer no answer. Furthermore, the misleading ""notes"" are phrased in passive-aggressive rhetorical question form. For example. This isn't a very good way to impart information to students, is it? It is repetitive, and annoying, when every sentence ends with a question mark, isn't it? I was irritated every time I tried to read this book for information, wasn't I?"
3,Does the job for now...........,First off---some evidence classes dont use casebooks but instead rely on fact/rule books. Not for my class--and Im glad. Mueller and Kirpatrick do a decent job of eliciting rules and then using cases to highlight the implementation of the rules. One major problem with the book is it tries to be a catch-all for federal and state rules------->and students suffer as a result. Therefore my professor has to go through and tell us which rules the book is discussing.But so far the book seems fine---Evidence itself is a tough class.
4,A sound buy,"I've read Noisy Farm repeatedly to my three- and two-year-old sons since it arrived in the post. They know the words, they know the sounds, they can't get enough of it. A lovely little children's book."
1,Baloney!,"This book is full of it! The Mormons do not believe in the biblical God of Christianity. They do not believe in the Trinity. They believe God is a being that lives on a ""mother planet"" and that we will all eventually be gods. They believe that Jesus was a created being, not eternal creator God. Mormons are polytheistic - Christians are monotheistic. Mormons feel that feelings validate reality - Christians obtain doctrine from the objective truth of God's Word, the Bible. True Christians are to have nothing to do with the occult beliefs held by the LDS"
2,Silly portrayal that strays far from the Bible,"I was looking for a family-oriented DVD to show to a Sunday School class, but this story is so inaccurate it is unusable. Scene after scene is full of made-up or rewritten events.I'm also not sure who the audience is supposed to be. It's a little bit violent for young children, but the production and story don't seem sophisticated enough to interest anyone over the age of 5 or 6.There are a lot of songs. The songs are so melodramatic the scenes are laughable. When young David is singing, he sounds like a woman.This movie was a huge disappointment."
3,Wasn't bad...since I was actually there!,"I was one of the people in the front row. Still have the special chair in my room. It could have been better, especially with how the main event (and things after this PPV) ended. Otherwise, i enjoyed this DVD."
3,WWE Survivor Series 2010 review,"The only 2 bad matches on the card are the World title match(Kane vs. Edge) & the WWE title match(Randy Orton vs. Wade Barrett with John Cena as Guest Ref) mainly becuase they're both slow,boring & plodding at best. The rest are not great but pretty good. No must-see mtaches with only 4 pretty good bouts to make up the lackluster world title bouts. Personal note: Im glad they finally fired John Cena even if it is for a short time. Overall,rent it don't buy it. I give this dvd a 5 out of 10."
5,Now Is The Hour,"At last a spiritual giant speaks out - bluntly sometimes - about war and peace - what doesn't work and what does work. Deepak Chopra can always be counted on to remind us and chide us about our soul responsibilities. I read this book from cover to cover with great hope seeping into my heart. I've read every book by Deepak Chopra - some many times - and as a former Editor of Science of Mind magazine, I've quoted him whenever an issue focused on personal choice. This book - Peace is the Way - is a powerful call for peace - to every thinking person. Peace depends on you and me, and I'm ready and eager to step up. My hope is that millions of people around the world - from every culture and every political persuasion (including hawks) - embrace the message of this book. It seems like our best hope yet. Elaine Maginn Sonne, Ph.D, the author of 5 books including 'Legends of the Stones'."
2,Don't expect too much,"After having read the reviews for this product, I was expecting more. This dvd is not instructional, but simly a bit of music, alot of colors and brief comments as to the chakras. Strictly to be used while meditating, in which case, many may not need a dvd, but rather music only. If you're wanting a simple meditation tool or wanting to trip visually on colors, this may be right for you. If you're looking for deeper insight and instruction into balancing the chakras, it's useless."
2,Disappointing DVD,"Was a bit disappointed in the DVD. Was expecting more affirmations associated with each chakra. I have an excellent audio CD and was hoping for the visual verison to enhance the experience.But if you're looking for a very basic chakra DVD, it's ok."
2,unpractical,"I bought this DVD to work with my chackras more, It was a short video, and I agree with the other raters that said it wasn't calming. It had images that not only did not fit with my perception of certain chackras which I can totally look past, but it was projected in clips that were like 2 minute commercials on each chackra. It was fast chatty and not something I would want to use as a meditation tool and in the year I owned it I watched it once. It doesn't seem to be developed as a meditation tool or for a deep introspection tool, but rather a simple introduction. This might be good conversation starter in a group session, introduction, even for someone who just wants to see a lot of colors and explore the body more."
1,chakra dud,this dvd is simply the worst. I threw money away. Visually it's like an acid trip. There are no meditative qualities. It's not relaxing in any way. Don't waste your money.
5,Great visuals & explanation,I have seen a lot of DVD's about Chakras and this is by far the best explanation I have seen. It is accompanied by amazing visual effects and perfectly matched music. I highly recommend it.
2,"Horrible Voiceover, Dated Graphics, Good Content","I had high expectations for this movie, because it seems like combining meditative music, hypnotic voiceover guidance, and 3d visualizations was a no brainer for a journey through the body's subtle energy systems. Unfortunately, the producer of this video cut corners on some of the animations, so while there are quite a few good ones there are enough really hokey spots that it distracts you from the journey.Worse still, the same lady, Anodea, decided that she should narrate this video. HUGE mistake! Her voice is not remotely relaxing, it sounds like a 50-something ex-valley girl reading her favorite passages from the Celestine Prophecy. They would have done better to have one of her gurus or swamis narrate it, at least then it would have had a shred of authority and credibility.Watching this movie just made me want to go and remake it with a capable narrator and quality animations."
3,Very short,The graphics and narration were very good in this DVD; however I was disppointed because it seemed like a very short DVD with not a lot of substance...So if you are looking for something that has any substance I'd recommend getting one of her books.
2,Not impressed,"I was hoping to expand my knowledge of the chakras, however this DVD provides an elementary introduction at best. A lot of time and energy was spent on imagery/graphics, and unfortunately not as much on content."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Since I was expecting a meditation dvd, I was very disappointed. The dvd is visually beautiful. It illustrates the chakras in colorful, almost 3d animation. That being said, however, that's it. There is no guided meditation. No information on working with the chakras. A real let down. One viewing was more than enough for me. And I really consider it a complete waste of money."
5,what every fan needs,"This is a great source to just go over a timeline of the star wars galaxy span over 25,000 years worth of star wars history from the formation of the Republic to formation of the Galactic Alliance and everything inbetween"

5,Son is a Star Wars freak,My son is seven years old and likes this book very much. There is so much detail within the covers. Excellent buy~!
3,A so-so book,You can spend time turning the pages and reading bits and pieces of info. Contains some typos. Just a coffee table book.
3,it`s for nerds!,"This thing is extremely nerdy, it even has a starwars timeline bby before the battle of yavin and aby after the battle of yavin! It has tons of stupid made up stuff that wasn`t even in the movies! If you are a nerd then go for it!"
2,rather disappointed,"I thought this would be similar to the Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, which show A LOT of details, cross-sections, and diagrams. Instead, it is full of comic/animated drawings, and many pics of Star Wars toys... and it is almost half as thin as The Complete Visual Dictionary. WTF?!I would return it if I could. :o("
4,Lots of Info,"I was fairly new to the Star Wars Universe when I first purchased this book. It did a great job of catching me up to speed. Although most of the items in the book are straight from the movies, it also taps into subjects such as the, The Great Sith War, The New Republic, Behind The Scenes,and Merchandising. There are not really any great pictures considering that most of them are also straight from the movies.Overall, I'd say I very much enjoyed this book. It is very informative and a must-have for any star wars fan. Enjoy!I also read in another review of this book that there is an error when it says that Ki-Adi-Mundi was the only jedi knight on the council. When I read that in the book, I was thoroughly confused, because in Episode III Anakin gets all worked up over being on the council and not being a master. He says something along the lines of, That's never been done in the history of the Jedi, it's insulting! Hmmm...."
5,Star Wars,"This book is GREAT! It covers ALL the Star Wars episodes. Love SW!!! The visuals are fantastic, very complete from the films and even the Old Republic. Darth Revan is a great bad figure."
4,Good overall history,My 6 year old son loves looking through this book and it brings back memories for me. It is a good short version of the overall history of the Star Wars saga. I wish they would have one that is much larger sometime. A good read anyway.
4,Who doesn't love precious moments !,Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the box was kinda dirty and old looking. But the statue inside was fine.
5,Winning the war within,I am studying this book in my sunday school class and I am really enjoying it. We love Charles Stanley and have done several of his books.
3,NFL New England Patriots sweatshirt,"The sweatshirt has a nice fleece feel but it does not resemble the one on the internet. This sweatshirt does not have a hooded string, and it is plastic embedded for the name.I kind of expected the sweat shirt to look more like the gray on the internet, what I got was a darker grey color, close to charcoal gray-black.the ad image looks more like a cotton texture, vs what i got in the mail. But i still like it despite what I saw in the internet."
3,Sliding Door Latch,It did not do what I wanted it to do but it is not the manufacturers fault that it did not work.
3,Not as seen on the picture,"Very low quality looking than on the web site picture, it work for what I need it so I kept it"
5,Great product.,"I have used different locks on the slider, non have been as easy to install or easy to use.Sence I put this in several of my friends have put in the same model because it works so well, andLooks so good.What's really nice is you can tell is locked at a glance, with the others you were not shure untill you checked the door."
1,Doesn't fit,"Doesn't fit, neither width nor height of the Blackberry curve 8300 series. Also brittle, therefore breaks easily."
1,No disabling magnet,"There is a slot on the back which should hold a magnet which tells the blackberry that it is in the holster and deactivates. This prevents buttons from being pressed and the power consumption is lower, and it changes profiles automatically. The slot was empty and there's no place to buy this magnet by itself... The whole reason I bought this case is because my magnet fell out on my existing case. I ended up getting it from AT&T's website.... Lame."
1,Complete Junk!,This thing lasted all of about 2 days before it snapped. It clamps the phone really well but the brittle plastic can't handle the flex it takes to remove your phone from it. Avoid this one for sure.
2,shortcake basket pan,I have made several batches of cakes & shortcakes and the basket definition does not come out on the cakes. You can't even tell that it is a basket which is disappointing to me since the picture on the advertisement of this pan is so cute. Any suggestions would be helpful.
4,"Great pan, but...","This is a great little pan for making individual shortcakes. The recipe that is attached to the pan is absolutely wonderful. Just make sure you grease the pan liberally or they will stick. My only complaint is the basket detail show in the picture is not what the final product looks like at all. I even tried to overbake the last time for more browning, but still does not look like a basket."
3,Cakes stuck first time,As they say I sprayed and floured the pan quite well I thought but the cakes still stuck in the pan. I'll try again.
5,best of phil ochs,cd was in excellent condition....shipped quickly.....one of phils best in my opinion....although its impossible to pick a favorite....30 plus yrs later....what a loss. I've always loved the live version of I Aint Marching Anymore at the end of this one...where he speaks to the audience....lots of great songs from a great man.
5,Make your fish great!,"This product is wonderful because you can control the amount of salt in your mix. It provides a nice light batter instead of a thick, sodium-laden one. Works for chicken as well!"
3,"cute dog coat, but watch those straps!","This dog coat is made well, looks great, and seems comfortable. The only drawback is that the straps that hold the back of the coat in place are such that when the dog urinates, the straps get wet. To avoid this we put the velcro straps on top of the coat. Not the best solution but did the trick. Still not bad for the price."
4,Warm Jack Russel Terrier,"My Jack Russel Terrier has an extremely thin hair coat--and her belly is basically bare. We live on a farm in North Idaho. She is fine out running around through the snow (for a while, anyway) when she can generate lots of body heat, but she needed something to wear in the car in the winter. As we know, it doesn't take long for that car to get cold while parked. This parka has been absolutely wonderful! She stays nice and toasty and it doesn't hang up on the seats like a fleece coat. I've bought a parka for each car and I have an extra in the house. You can't beat the price!Linda"
4,Helpful egg timer,"While not perfect, this ""timer"" does help to cook eggs as you would like them. The qualified portion of this review: If you like your eggs truly soft, you must pay close attention and, as soon as the outside perimeter goes dark, you need to take out your egg(s) or they will be overcooked.This timer is far easier to read if you prefer your eggs ""medium"", which to me appear much closer to fully cooked.Timing is a trial and error process as there are no instructions included with the timer."
4,Great music - reason to watch the Alfie remake,"While the Alfie remake does not quite measure up to the original Alfie, the soundtrack is superb! Great lyrics and singing by Jagger and Stewart."
4,"Love Mick & Dave, but where's the rest?","I just watched movie and fell in love with the music, not the movie, just the music. I will order the CD, but was disappointed to find that the sexiest song I've ever heard was not on the album. That song played on the juke box in the bar when he and Lynette were seducing each other - Oh, baby! But it's not here. Guess I'll try to find it somewhere else. Great music otherwise."
4,groovy,"a largely diverse and entertaining array of songs by the talented Dave Stewart and Mick Jagger (who is so refreshing simply accompanied by acoustic guitar).If you like this one, I recommend Frantic by Bryan Ferry - also touched by Stewart's magic."
3,Works as an album,"I bought this because I am a Rolling Stones/Eurythmics/Joss Stone/Sheryl Crow fan. I have no desire to see the movie, unless someday years from now it comes on tv. I am impressed how the recording, unlike most soundtracks, stands on its own as an album, even with the contributions from the different artists. The rocking instrumentals, by Jagger/Stewart, work very well, and in fact, ""New York Hustle"" is probably my favorite track, with absolutely fantastic harmonica work from Jagger. Joss Stone sings incredibly like she always does. Shery Crow is actually unnecessary, but pleasant. I have never understood why Rolling Stones fans think it's so cool to trash Mick Jagger's solo work. Supposedly he's one half of the Glimmer Twins, but ask the average creaky old Stones fan and they'll say Jagger can't wipe his butt correctly without ""Three Chord Keith"" there to tell him how to do it. That's just a pathetic pose.UPDATE: I saw this movie. It was great."
3,"ok, but not more than that","Overall it's a nice to listen album. But, as is the case with lots of soundtrack cd's, it's filled with some remixes of tracks that are already on the cd. I personally feel that in this case the remixes add nothing and they should have added some more tracks instead."
4,Great CD,"Alfie...great movie, and terrific soundtrack. While I'm not a big Jagger fan, I immediately felt this was some of his all-time best work as I wathced the movie. Had to have the track for my collection."
1,Item not original but a copy!!,"The item bought was a copy. Why; spelling errors on sleeve, sometimes not readable by cd player. Not good for Amazon."
2,Rather dull music,"I'm not sure how this music holds up as a soundtrack to a movie because I haven't seen the movie. But, just upon hearing the samples, it's a pass. I liked ""Primitive Cool"" more than this, the second, Dave Stewart and Mick Jagger collaboration. Mick keeps exploring other avenues besides the Stones, which is artistically healthy, but he never seems to surpass the bad boys. Mick might make the solo album of his dreams, and I know he wants to be a big solo act, by pursuing the blues instead of this pop schmalk sound."
3,so so,"the soundtrack of Alfie is Mick Jagger's fifth solo album (though in this record there are a couple of songs that are not performed by Sir Jagger), it is the first soundtrack recorded by Sir Jagger, and it marks the second time Sir Jagger collaborates with Dave Stewart (the first time was on Primitive Cool).The result of this second collaboration is so so. Some of the songs (such as for example the blind leading the blind) sound very much some of the songs Jagger recorded for Goddess in the Doorway--and that album was far from being a great album.Old Habits Die Hard is probably the best song of the record and the acustic guitar work right at the beginning is quite nice. The major problem of this record is that Jagger's voice is not as strong and good as it should be to carry this album.Overall this record is so so."
1,Maybe my expectations were off,"I saw the announcement that Jaggar was heavily involved in the soundtrack for Alfie. I'm a big Stones fan, I realize that Mick's solo work has not quite been up to the Stones level, but I found _nothing_ in the Alfie soundtrack that would cause me to listen to it a second time. You'll find my copy on E-Bay when I get around to it."
2,"Answer for ""Ronii""","Not sure about the first song you were asking about ( where he is in the bar where everyone is dancing) but the second song you were looking for (where he is playing pool with his friends girlfriend) is called ""For the love of you"". Performed by the Isley Brothers. Hope this helps."
2,too big,"This product is too big. I mean u dont see a kid walking around with a case like this. The reason i didnt give it 1 star is because its sturdy and when you drop it, the psp is still not damaged. This case would be great if u just store it at home, but i wouldnt recommend it if your looking for a case to store it in when your traveling."
1,Homespun remedies,"Natural Goat and Alpaca care was described to me as the goat owner's 'bible'. I had high expectations of this book, however high expectations are often followed by disappointments and this book was no exception.There is a lack of science and an over reliance on homespun remedies. References quoted were vague and ranged from unnamed butchers to conversations with fellow attendees at conferences. The tone of the book varied from a folksy chatty style to the authoritarian. Words like 'never' and 'must' appeared with monotonus regularity.The most important thing someone like me needs to know from an animal husbandy book is what is normal, and when to call a vet. But in this book, vets don't exist and sick animals are soley the result of a lack of remineralised soil.For an exprienced, conventional farmer who knows animal husbandry well and who would like to try some natural therapies, this book may well be useful. However, for a beginner like me, it has limited use."
2,"you'll have to replace the crank, but it's worth it!","I received this as a shower gift and loved it. However, after cranking it up once a night every night, it quit when my daughter was ten months old. The crank won't work, and the music won't play, and numerous calls to the manufacturer have not yielded any results. For a thirty dollar mobile you would hope it would last more than a few months.UPDATE................I must admit that after contacting the company, Dolly, they very quickly sent a replacement music box for the one that had broken. They were very friendly to deal with and the shipment was prompt, I'm so thankful."
5,Cute and friendly mobile,"I am a fan of Boyd's bears and have many in my daughter's room. I chose this mobile because of that and because of it's color scheme. It was easy to assemble and attach to crib. My daughter loves it and watches the bears in amazement. She immediately turns to the bears when I pick her up from her crib and touches and grabs them. They can be EASILY removed and rehung, which makes it great to let her play with them away from the mobile. They are hung by a knot at the end of each rope that catches on the hanger for each bear. The knot does not need to be undone to remove, just lift up the rope and slide off hanger. SIMPLE! It has male and female bears in their robes and slippers, VERY CUTE!"
2,Less than five mintues.,"Although this mobile is very cute, and the twinkle twinkle little star music box that powers it is very soothing, the music box plays for less than 5 minutes when it is fully wound. Hardly long enough to put a baby to sleep."
1,Does a skin graft coupon come with this?,"If you want to remove a layer of skin along with the hair you intended to shave off, then this razor is for you! As for me, I'm going back to my trusty Gillette Venus. If zero stars was available as a rating, I'd have given it zero stars."
4,RUSSELL'S RHAPSODY,"Brenda Russell---pop diva? Disco queen? Soul singer? R&B; vocalist? Or all of the above?Style aside, Russell is an accomplished artist, a Donna Summer compatriate with a more eclectic repertoire. This 1990 effort blends all the above-mentioned styles into a well produced and tasteful collection.The strongest tracks for me:KISS ME WITH THE WIND - a bouncy disco-influenced tune right out of the 80sALL AMERICAN military flavored funkJUSTICE IN TRUTH - Russell's passionate vocals soar on this lush balladNIGHT TRAIN TO LENINGRAD - a superb arrangement and its politically infused lyrics inspire this unique tunEDINNER WITH GERSHWIN - Donna Summer even recorded this Russell-penned ditty and scores high in her own spirited version.Russell has written tons of songs for other artists and had modest success as a singer. KISS ME WITH THE WIND is a solid record lost in the then volatile music scene."
4,Very pop-ish,"Here you get to know the pop-side of Brenda Russell. It almost sounds like a Stock Aitken Waterman production. Very pop-ish and very 80s. Quite some fun, but people who look for a song like ""Get here"" look in vain. There is here own version of ""Dinner with Gershwin""(also sung by Donna Summer) and some more catchy tunes like ""All Americans""."
3,Basic work glove,"I ordered large and received X Large. The quality of construction is not what I expected, but they will do for basic work gloves. Only time will tell as to their durability."
2,Poor Durability,Had these only about a month handling firewood. Wore a hole through fingers of gloves. The fit loosens with minimum wear also.
4,Funny!,"This book had me laughing all the way home, and I enjoyed every minute with the book's leading lady- feisty, real... Great stuff. Perfect summer reading!"
5,Simple and Good,"I'm yet to figure out what it is, but from 2 months old till now at 6 months old my son is just totally fascinated by this very simple crib mobile. So much so that even when you don't turn it on he just lies there looking at it laughing and making those noises babies make when they are well entertained.This was definitely a GREAT!!! buy."
2,just ok,"My baby likes to look at the objects but I think there are a few cons: it doesn't attach to my pack n play, you cannot turn it without music playing and the objects just turn but only really move when you hit them. It is cheap though."
3,"Great Mobile for Price, but Music Sucks","This is a really great mobile for the price, but I don't understand why they didn't make it so you could at least turn the music off! I just want the mobile function, not the sound, but there is no way to turn down the sound or turn off the sound.I gave it three stars because I have other crib toys that make better music, but I can't use the music on them cause I got this lousy sounding thing going off instead. I suppose I could just have multiple songs playing at once, but how annoying is THAT?So, its a good mobile, but the music isn't good quality and it isn't optional... your stuck with it."
1,TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK,Do not but this mobile. Ours stopped spinning after 4 weeks. The music is tinny and loud. There are much much better mobiles out there. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
3,a present for great nephew,he's only 2 months old seems to watch it and like itbut really can't tell . He's to young.
1,unsafe,The mobile is too heavy and it simply does not attach properly to the crib (it slides forward and since the construction is so cheap I have no confidence that it won't dettach and fall in the crib). I was very happy to find such a cheap mobile to replace our old/broken one since I was only hoping to get 4-6 weeks of use before converting to a music box since my (preemie) baby is already 5mo old but still unable to get up on hands and knees.
4,first time mom,I had my matching mobile that went with my crib bedding set. But it was the one I had to turn and it would only play few seconds and stop and then my baby would start crying. This musical mobile is cool because it uses batteries and when you turn it on it goes on for about 15 minutes. It has 5 pleasant songs and my baby likes it a lot.
1,A cheap piece 'o junk!,"Executive Summary: a piece of junkReview:-sound is cheap sounding. Some of the notes are actually out of tune- no joke! Very jarring to listen to (at least for an adult.)-Ours came missing one of the four hanging pieces!-it's the cheapest plastic it can be, with some sloppily slapped on stickers in places-nothing good to say about it"
4,Good Stuff,"A bit pricey, but I've yet to find anything better for preventing and in some cases curing corrosion on electrical devices. I'm into model airplanes and have brought servos back from the dead by shooting some corrosion block into the guts of the things. Every time I crack open an automotive connector I shoot a bit on it just for insurance. It works."
1,disappointment,i bought my troika athens watch about 3 months ago froma local merchant in nyc and in less than 6 weeks it wasntkeeping good time. i have to wind it now to keep it going.the automatic movement has stopped completely.
1,Not for sale product!,"I bought the mini version of Dolce And Cabbana and did not think they would sell me a ""not for Sale"" product for 15.98 including shipment-costs. After sending right an email on which Beauty Encounter not responded, I called them and they said they are allow to sell ""not for sale"" samples because they buy them from the manufacturer. I pointed out to the customer service representative that the perfume also was not the real one, because it had almost no odor of the Feminine smell. She said that that is not possible. They sent an email with the wrong perfume name on it and after calling again, they did resend one with the right name so no I can return it.Bottom line: I do not recommend this seller."
3,SE Knife available from Amazon works better,"I bought this knife and the SE Knife from Amazon. The blade edge on this knife doesn't get under the watch case tab as easily as the SE Knife. Also, the SE Knife seems to have easier prying with its flat handle vs. this knife's rounded handle."
4,What you see is what you get,"Ok, the name of the movie is THE KILLING OF SATAN and it's from the Philippines! If you expect some kind of cinematic masterpiece, you're nuts. This movie, I was glad I bought. It is ridiculous and though I watched it alone, this is an Ultimate pick for a background party movie. Made with I am guessing close to 3 American dollars (saying that with the image of the costumes in my mind), this is a flick I can toss in, smile and be happy to share with friends, not as an awesome movie that needs to be seen, but as an entertaining, goofy and enjoyable little cult gem that can make your crappy day, if you are having one, go away. How often will you see a small filipino man with a porn mustache beat up satan?"
2,"And in this corner, we have satan...","Very strange movie. I'm a theology student, but have to admit, I was unaware that one could fight the forces of darkness by literally beating the hell out them, and seriously, several devils (actually, guys in devil costumes, complete with lil' tails) get the living...spit beat out them in a number of fisticuffs involving the protagonists of this, um...movie.Very weird. Must be seen to be believed. I'll probably never watch it again, but I don't regret having made the purchase. On Amazon Marketplace. Used. And for like, three bucks."
5,"Baby,Please YES","This was the most riveting piece of literature I have read in a long time, quite possibly the best book by a young author written in my generation. Unlike a certain person who is apparently lacking in any sense of literary comprehension who finds dynamic and ""real"" characters to be flat and seemingly un-stimulating in any way, I found it to be most insightful. The author/narrator exposes the reader to a crude depiction of the harsh reality of her struggle and ultimate survival. The language she uses lacks literary ""fluff"" in order to allow readers to truly grasp the stark facts of her experience. If this was her goal, she definetly achieved it. I hope the aforementioned person who made the unfortunate decision to submit a review is able to stay sober long enough to recognize a good book."
5,Spellbinding,"I started this book last night, thinking I would just read for ten minutes before bed. I didn't put it down until my Kindle battery died at 3AM. This book is absolutely riveting. What this woman endured before her 18th birthday is more than anyone should have to endure in an entire lifetime. To have survived and come out on the other end will give hope and insight to anyone affected by abuse - perpetrated by others or on one's self. I think the most powerful message of this work is to look at those around us who seem like ""bad"" kids, to understand that there is pain beneath the toughness, and a human who is trying desperately to survive."
3,book,this memoir was purchased for my daughter for a project in school; it arrived on time and served its purpose
4,Gerry Loses His Cool,"Gerry certainly sheds his cool image with this early 1960's recording, sounding much closer to Pepper Adams than to Serge Chaloff or Cecil Payne. He even thows in a Adamsesque quasi quote at one point. The little known standards Here I'll Stay and You've Come Home are so strong that you wonder why they paid royalties to Cole Porter for Get Out of Town. Oddly enough I found the sheet music for both of them in the same out of print hardcover music book at a local library.Things cool off a bit for a couple of tunes but Gerry declines or the record company declined a out and out ballad. The influence of the conga drummer is very minimal"
3,Pleasant Relaxation,"Until I saw Jeru featured in a big-box book/music store which I frequent, I had never heard of it. Much less had I heard why it merited a remaster and a reissue. But since I own several other Gerry Mulligan recordings which I thoroughly enjoy, I bought it at an excellent price hoping to find a hidden gem.Well, that didn't happen but what I did find was a CD that at least induced feelings of pleasant relaxation, From what I have heard of Mulligan's music, that is what I always get. Nothing outstanding, but nothing lousy, Just good, competent jazz in a smooth vein without the pejorative stigma that comes with that ""smooth"" label.I like the entire CD, but it seems to me that for the money the label could have featured some bonus tracks that have become almost de rigeuer on reissues of classic albums. If you like Gerry Mulligan, I'm certain you'll agree that while Jeru may not be essential, it is certainly enjoyable."
4,the sun is a very lucky fellow,"I agree that this is not the complete Donovan box. I want to get Celeste,Fat Angel, I Love My Shirt,The Sun is a Very Lucky Fellow, Sunny Goode Street,Brother Sun Sister Moon, Turquoise, Little Tin Soldier,Isle of Islay,Hey Gyp,Love Floats,and Preachin'Love. These are my missing favorites. This box set is a wonderful start to a great artist that is/was wrongfully compared to Dylan. I've seen them both perform live. They are different. Donovan seemed to be very warm and talked openly to the crowd. Dylan had the respect of doing his set in his own way with little interaction. This box set was $13 with no liner notes and zippo anything else. Sound quality is great but I'm not that fussy.I enjoy a box set not costing over $30."
5,OLA !!!!,"Man this cat is at the top of my music chain. I never heard of him until i went on cd baby, and what i heard was phenominal. This is one bad dude. Would love to have him in a show here in the states with some others of his style. He's sho-nuff tuff."
5,I'M SO GLAD I FOUND HIM!!!!,"I had never heard of Ola until I received an email from another musician who had received a review from the UK. The actual website had other artist on it and I happened to read about Ola. So, I went to another website and sampled songs from this CD. I didn't buy the CD at that time, but did eventually purchase it. I'm so glad I did. I like his sound, very refreshing. Can't wait to purchase more of his previous CD's and also his latest."
3,Great potential...,"Saw Ola Onabule on TV in a recorded concert and was blown away by the voice...and the vocal simularity to great soul singers of yesteryear. I rushed to buy the CD...but was a bit disapointed with the mostly forgetable selection of songs. The voice is great ! but the material seems weak.In defense of the album , I may have been expecting more of the classic soul songs and stylings that I saw on TV. The material here tries to be jazzier and more complex.I'm sure that others will disagree with my narrow little opinion.I'll definitely keep track of future releases by this gifted vocalist in hopes that one comes along that's more to my taste."
5,One of the best albumns of all time,"It is very rare that I find an CD that so easily inspires such a range of emotion. If you close your eyes, listen and let the music fill you, you can almost visualize the legendary Battle of Heaven. When I first heard it, I felt dread, excitement, loss, sorrow and fear (And I still do!). To simply put it, this CD is AMAZING. Now only if Glenn and Plan 9 will put it back into circulation!!! *hint*"
3,not a very solid work,"Another reviewer hit the nail on the head with his review...the songs all sound like intros to songs. They start out awesome and it makes you think something seriously evil surely is to come; and then the song suddenly ends?? There is no body to any of the songs and the album is relatively short 20-25 minutes. You would think a composition such as this would be a bit longer. But from a guy who sang teenagers from mars this is a far cry from that and pretty good in comparison. Im a huge fan of all of his work from the misfits to samhain to danzig and i would say this is worth a spin, just dont get your hopes up as much as i did."
1,"Terrible, Horrendous, Hideous, Bad, Embarrasing..","I can't think of any more negative adjectives to describe this album. What a joke! Being in a terrible, amaturish, 2nd rate metal band is one thing - but then trying to create a 'classical' piece of art? Give me a break!I played this cd for my grandfather and he laughed. enough said.stick to your day job, glenn!If you want real classical music, i'd advise staying away from this but buying records from mozart, bach, beethoven, etc."
2,ruin it,"i bought this for my husband for christmas. i thought that this would be a good watch for him, being the fact that it looked nice and was fairly cheap~~he is kinda rough on watches, fishing, hunting ect.~~ but he hadn't even wore it yet doing anything like that and when he was at work he would sweat and the sweat i don't know kinda coroated-sp- the back and the band of the watch. so while it looks nice it would be the best if it is just worn occasionally or expect to buy a couple so once that one gets all nasty you have a couple of backups"
3,oops but its was a gift,"Ordering was simple. Quick shipping. Only negative was the listing did not reveal print on back, and symbol was much larger in person. It was like I got a whole different item shipped to me. But item wasn't realized until after it was given as a gift. They liked it so much I couldn't take back. Still tried to clear things up with company, but never got an actual person to answer cs number from paperwork."
2,Disappointing,"This is the only disc by Joe Henry that I don't like. I'm a huge fan of this guy, but this; his second release, is a dud. While being overproduced, the material is bland and just doesn't have anything that grab's you. He's changed styles a few times over the years, and I've liked the variety, but this one has no personality, so to speak."
3,Still Looking For A Sound,"This is Henry before he hit his Mammoth Records stride and way before his arty phase on Anti-. It's not fantastic, but it's definitely no dog either. For fans, it's worth picking up. But if you're new to Henry, try to find a copy of SHUFFLETOWN, SHORT MAN'S ROOM, or KINDNESS OF THE WORLD instead."
2,can not replace battery,as this might be a cute little item i used once. when i tryed to remove battery it stuck. i can not open therefor this is useless. i tryed to return and was told nonreturnable.. where does that say in item info? also kinda weak
3,Not impressed,"Wish I had taken the product description seriously when it says ""powerful"". The dolphin wasn't really doing much for me and the vibration was a little too intense- hurt my hand just to hold it while it was turned on. It also doesn't really have an off switch- you twist it to turn it on and untwist to shut it off. It pops open when you try to shut it off. All in all, it's not worth it."
2,"Not as powerfull as they used to be, dissapointing.","They must have cheaped out on the design, they are not as powerfull as they used to be. Typical I gues now a days, cheaper product for more money. I'll be looking for something else."
1,defective product!,Just got it and it does not work and hasn't since i took it out of the package. Waste of money.
3,It works,"It works for it's intended purpose, but even a brand new battery doesn't last more than 5-10 minutes. Invest in rechargeables!!! Or you may be feeling very, ahem, frustrated. Other than that, not a bad product for the price paid."
2,Mixed Feelings,"A powerhouse of academic scholarship, this book is the most tedious and boring biography I have ever read. Too many pages on Bacon's political career, too little on his scientific achievements."
1,"looked nice, awful quality","The first coat rack that was shipped to me was in awful shape. The box had been practically destroyed and was held together with mass amounts of tape. Many pieces were missing. it was unusable.Amazon was great and let me ship it back for free with no problems for an exchange.Problem was, the new one had its issues too. All the pieces were there, and when assembled, it looked really good. But a few heavy coats on one side would easily topple it over. Several of the pegs that hold your coats broke. The wood used on this is really cheap. Overall, this thing just isn't worth it. impractical design and cheap materials combine to make this a one star item."
2,Poor quality design/wood. Great shipping/price/delivery time.,"I received the coat rack perfectly on time, to be given as a xmas present.The price was amazingly cheap and the shipping was timely.The price might be a consideration, but the craftsmanship of this coat rack is far from good.-Upon assembly, I realized the top had been screwed into the bottom, without the middle spacer...after attempting to unscrew the two, I discovered that it would be impossible.-After assembly, the coat rack quickly broke a leg off, when one or two jackets were placed on it. The legs of the rack are not designed well. We had fixed the broken legs and glued them in place.Despite the design flaws, and possibly inferior wood, this coat rack is not serving our needs well...and, was sold to us at quite an agreeable price."
4,Great value; classy look,Any other coat rack that looks this nice costs a lot more. Just remember to assemble it properly (don't forget the piece at the very bottom that keeps it from tipping)!
3,"Interesting enough but not ""outstanding""","This was interesting to watch. It's really ""just another movie"" but it's worth watching if you're a big movie watcher like myself. It would have been better to rent this instead of purchase, but I purchase many foreign films just because they're not so easily available in the US and have enjoyed several Danish films recently, notably Adam's Apples, Brothers, and Pusher Trilogy, which are very good movies."
2,Too Much Like Other Book,"This book is almost identical to his other book: ""Successful Cold-Climate Gardening"". If you have the other one, you don't need this one."
5,20,jag har skrivit en book som jag kallar för anuskig heter p sörker if sörker är en plats i sweden
5,excellent but obscure!,"I have all of michelangeli,s recordings on the bigger labels. deutsche grammopon,EMI these recordings are top rate. they are done from euro radio and tv shows. most all the matrial is from 1962-1990. the last disk was done in the forty's this disk is not very good but all the others are par excellence! the debussy images,the brahms.schumann,beethoven and most of the chopin,these recordings put the big labels to shame. this set is not a bargin its simply a giveaway! Buy it NOW!"
3,samhain,"I'm quite a fan of Misfits, Samhain & Danzig but this cd was quite a dissapointment,there are good tracks but songs such as Trouble sound incomplete and mismatched. The standout tracks are Death...in its arms, The Birthing and Possession. Maybe a cd for completists but i think a better introduction to Samhain would be Initium. Glenn Danzig is a talent beyond belief and his earlier solo work is fantastic but this cd shows his flaws!"
2,Dont Waste Your Money,"This book was not helpful at all. After reading He's Just Not That Into You I expected something somewhat similar in this book; a little comedy, straightforward advice, and simple clear instructions about how to change your ways. No. The first couple chapters only talk about sex and the bad feelings woman experience after in some cases. The book also contradicts itself, by saying things like quit wasting your time on losers but then says to make sure your expectations aren't high."
1,An Unoriginal Effort,"Wow, this guy wrote a book that 'takes up where' another book 'left off?' Hopefully others have noticed the blatant attempt to cash in on another books success. I am baffled since he didn't write the first book to begin with.I have read this book and will just say it did nothing for me. I am confused that so many guys have been writing books about the female perspective, am I missing something here. Anyway I am sure we can all look forward to new books from this author such as, Larry Rotter & The Full-Blood Princess, Wink - The Art of Thinking While Thinking or perhaps, American Men Overeat: The Secret of Eating For Gluttony. Anyway you cut it I am appalled.As I suggested before if you would like a different perspective that is honest and fresh try Seed's Sketchy Relationship Theories - A Guide to the Perils of Dating. This actually challenges the reader to think for themselves."
1,Waste of money--just get the original book!,"I was really irritated by this book. I actually have the audiobook version, and I kept yelling at my stereo in annoyance.Did the author even bother to read ""He's Just Not That Into You""? Because it seems like he's actually making quite a few similar points--albeit from a somewhat different angle, with a condescending tone, and subtracting most of the style and wit of the Greg Behrendt book.Overall, I felt like Kerner wasn't even offering any solid advice--he just goes on and on in this really patronizing way about what women are doing wrong.Also, the whole CONCEPT of the book is totally cynical, as it cleary intends to capitalize on the success of the other (far superior, in my opinion) book."
2,Not as good as He's Just Not That In To You,"I was disappointed with this book. I bought it because I loved ""He's Just Not That Into You"" so much. This one was more about sex and not about what's important to the female in the relationship. In the beginning it talked a lot about women masturbating - something I'm proud to say I don't do - but this book will make you believe all of us do. I think it's just the author's sick fantasy. Buy this book if you dare, but you probably won't enjoy it as much and if you're a female."
1,Absolutely Pathetic.,"I had read the book ""He's Just Not That Into You"", and I must say I find faults with both this and that book. The first book assumes way too much about guys. For instance, if the guy doesn't call you back the next day after the date, he's apparently not interested. That kind of advice is sheer lunacy. Even if a guy is interested, he may not call because he doesn't want the woman to think he's a loser chasing (which I assure you she will. In fact, alot of girls try to get rid of a guy if he calls the day after) her.So anyways, this book is already starting out on the wrong track by giving way too much credit to the first book. Secondly, this book seems to want to give goddess stature to all women. As if every woman should get the best looking guy out there, even if she herself is fat and ugly. Yeah, way to help out your fellow gender Mr. Wuss.This book is almost a breeding ground for lesbianism it's so bad. The book is not worth the paper it was printed on. NEXT!"
3,Of Course I'm Not Into Him,"in-the-meantime guys serve a purpose, which is why they are named thatwhy would u want to get rid of them waiting on the right man? you'll be so depressed from sittin in the house bored, nobody will want you when you do get out"
1,horrible horrible horrible!!,"I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy! IT was stupid, and pointless unless you want to learn more about ""servicing yourself"". The first half of the book was about nothing except sex and why women masturbate. It assumed that every women does and is just filthy! the author's attempt to make it like the popular ""He's just not that into you"" failed horrible! At least the other book can go both ways!I'm regretting ever buying this book and would never ever tell anyone to read it! It was a waste of time!"
1,And if all else fails have a fridge full of your favorite ice cream to EAT,"Generally women need (and secretly like) being treated poorly - so long as her man ""comes around"" and acts nicey-nice; you know, buys her a small, yet meaningful gift. Gives her a genuine-sounding compliment to boost her ego. Then he is required to go back to acting like a cretin; it's a cycle you see - she needs him to be a jerk, so that when he does do something kind-hearted it really stands out. If he was sweet, nice, kind, gentle, thoughtful ALL THE TIME - that would get BORING, and she'd leave him for someone who could provide the needed drama that I described. So this book is total nonsense. To be used for those times when she's needing ""empowerment"" - and when the man has grown tired, and wise to the con of her need for drama."
3,"Funny, but has an unclear theme","Kerner's book has a lot going for it - it's funny, it provides a man's point of view, and has some good information about sex and male/female differences. As you read the book, you grow to like Kerner a little. And the professed theme of the book, which advises women to stop settling and to wait for the real thing, is a REALLY important message that more women's books need to focus on.On the downside, I had a hard time getting clear on what exactly Kerner's point was. He seemed to tell women to not settle, but then talked quite a bit about sex (he's a sex therapist) and provided a chapter written by his wife about meeting him. The book seemed to give you an overview and make you laugh, rather than really dive into the more meaty topic of raising your standards.Overall, a decent book and worth a read. But not a classic."
2,"To Be Honest, I Just Wasn't Into This Book","As many others have mentioned, this book focuses on sex more than anything, which really isn't the first thing I want to focus on when I'm dating to find a relationship. The title should've been, ""Be honest, you are just looking for some booty."" I also thought it was kind of petty and immature for the author of this book to spend so much time putting down ""HJNTIY."" I agree with other reviews that claims the author is trying to piggyback on that books success. Anyways, save your money, ladies. There are much better books about relationships and dating than this garbage."
1,Sheer exploitation,"I was very disappointed with this book. It was given to me by a friend because I had so enjoyed ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" but this is not the same author but just someone who decided to take advantage of the hard work of the original writers of the first book and name his book something similar. I found none of the humor and warmth I was expecting, nor any delving into what is important to ME in a relationship, which is moral make up of people, their beliefs and feelings. Everyone is stripped down to their biology. It is as if someone filmed a high school biology lecture and then named it ""Lord of the Rings"" so people would buy it."
3,Be Honest--You're Not That Into Him Either,"This book is mostly about sex, probably because it was written by a sex therapist. It is nothing like ""He's Just not that into you"" which is more of a how to guide to dating and relationships. This ""sex book"" is not all that great."
5,A Must-Read for Single Women...,"I picked up this book yesterday and couldn't put it down. I just wish it had come out sooner -- like when I started my downward spirial of dating guys that I wasn't that into when I graduated from college.The book is easy-to-read and funny. Forget ""The Rules."" This book provides useful, non-preachy advice. For some funny reason, I felt like Dr. Kerner was cheering me on from the sidelines. Definitely worth buying. Don't judge this one by the picture on its cover...."
3,Misses the mark,"OK, I have read both this book and the other similar one. I took a huge dislike to the other book because the approach was so one-dimensional.While I can say that ""Be Honest..."" is not quite as judgmental, my overall impression of it is that it misses the mark.For one thing it spends tons of time on sex, which for MOST women, is NOT really what relationships are about.When the book does actually get into the emotional aspects of it, I got the impression the author kind of just breezed through the topic - using a few examples along the way, but never really getting into the core of anything.I can't really put my finger on the problem, except to say that I did not ""get"" anything out of this book - at al."
2,If I am being honest...I am just not into this book,I thought it would be humorous it wasn't! And I was really really excited to read it! It was mildly raunchy and was not at all like I expected.
2,Why?,"Dumptruck is one of my favorite bands of all time so giving any CD they release a two hurts, but the selections on this CD are mindnumbingly stupid. Watch Her Fall is the only essential song on here and they make 5 star albums that are incredible without a weak track. Please buy the albums D Is For Dumptruck and For The Country they contain some of the best music from any guitar driven rock with an etheral feel, that makes depressing lyrics fascinating, ever."
1,boring,was very easy for my daughter who was preschool age. She got bored really easy and didn't want to play. She stopped using it within the first week of play.
4,I love this book!,"I love it, the first opening was surprised with the detail of the illustration that the artist manages the entire anatomy of the animals, breathtaking details of bones, muscles, hair etc.. A book that must be present in the library of any artist, animator, sculptor, modeller etc. I have to buy the other books in this series."
5,Great guide from a great artist,"Charles Knight is well known for his groundbreaking animal reconstructions. Even if this book isn't as heavily illustrated as I thought it would be, is full of useful advice from this incredible artist whose paintings did so much for natural history. I really enjoyed reading his extensive comments on each of the ""animal type"" chapters. The introduction, which is about animals through the history of painting and sculpture from the cave paintings to the XX century is simply great. The biggest section is the one about big cats, by the way, and all the drawings are superb."
5,very happy with all the purchases I havr made and very good delivery,"I have been happy with all the books and video's I have purchased from your company, Delivery is prompt tou give great service for people at home .CheersGrace"
4,"Expensive, but expansive","The book is not cheap, but it has been extremely helpful to me. This is not a ""starter"" dictionary, nor should it be the only Persian-Farsi dictionary in your collection. It is very useful when you know what subject you need to research, and it supplements my other dictionaries quite well. This dictionary contains useful slang, and some other uncommon words not found in other resources."
5,metro chase is excellent!,"This is an excellent movie for children, probably between the ages of 6 and 12. It's a fun romp through Paris and kids and parents alike will be very entertained throughout the entire movie! I strongly encourage everyone to buy this dvd for their kids!"
5,Overwhelmed!,"It is a staggering collection, better suited for libraries than the individual collector. I have to wonder if one can ever get through so many volumes. I have about 20 of the volumes already, and have enjoyed them immensely, as they provide excellent coverage of great American writers, political thinkers and essayists. I find the writings of Washington, Jefferson, Madison and the Constitutional Debates most fascinating, as they get to the heart of the so-called ""original intent"" of the Constitution. I also have copies of late 19th century writers like Melville and Whitman. However, my favorite remains the complete writings and illustrations of James Thurber, from which I draw endless pleasure. At this hefty price tag, I have to say it is better to buy the volumes you think best suit your interests. There really isn't that much of a ""savings"" in buying the complete set."
5,Another window opened into history,"Have so far purchased ""Reporting World War II"" (both volumes) and ""Reporting Vietnam"" (both volumes). I have never experienced history the way it is presented by the war correspondents who's experiences are transcripted as they unfold.I don't know if I'd jump into purchasing the entire set but for a history buff who desires to ""experience"" events as they happen I cannot give a higher recommendation than the war correspondent collection."
4,Acoustic Erasure,"""Boy"" is the lead-off track from the new Erasure acoustic album ""Union Street,"" to be released in April. This EP contains other acoustic tracks not included on the album, and a new ambient synth piece from Vince Clark. ""Boy"" (not to be confused with the old Book of Love club hit) is reworking of the 1997 original, and seems as if it had been written with this new arrangement in mind. The gentle guitars allow Andy Bell an unobtrusive backing on which to work his vocal magic--the standout track on this EP.This EP will not be released on CD in the US, only via download, so if you want the physical object, you need to buy this import.""Cry So Easy"" has the original 1985 vocals paired with new instrumentation--this is why it was not included on the album, which includes all new vocals.""I Bet You're Mad At Me"" is taken from a BBC radio session from 2005.""Jacques Cousteau"" is the ambient piece.All in all, a must have for Erasure fans. Can't wait for the album!"
5,Chanteuse & More!,In a perfect world Connie Champagne would be world famous and Madonna would be an obscure piano bar singer. Want to hear one of San Francisco's best singers? Get Connie!
5,The Inner Grail Quest,"Emma Jung, Carl Jung's wife, made a lifelong study of the Grail Legend, preparing for this book. After her death in 1955, her project was completed by Marie-Louise von Franz, the most pre-eminent of Carl Jung's disciples and one of the most respected expositors of Jungian psychology. This book, a Jungian analysis of the Grail Legend, is regarded as a masterpiece. What is the Grail Legend about? In a word: meaning. It is how the Fool, Perceval, finds the Holy Grail and thus rescues the suffering Fisher King from his non-life in the Wasteland. This book explains how that story, with its triumphant conclusion, can take place in each one of us. For anyone fascinated by the Grail and curious about its relevance to life today, there simply is no better book than Jung & Franz's study."
5,Very Deep Analysis of a Very Deep Matter +++,"I found ""The Grail Legend"" by Emma Jung [and M. L. von Franz] to be very thoughtful and detailed. Likely, the Holy Grail was a main concern for most of Emma Jung's life. One can readily see why Carl Jung viewed that subject matter as his ""wife's turf"". ""Animus and Anima"", also by Emma Jung, is an excellent little summary of Jungian Psychology with a focus on Animus and Anima. In contrast, ""The Grail Legend"" is so deep and detailed, that I found myself having to review several Jungian works to ""keep up"". Namely, ""Animus and Anima"", ""The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious"" and ""Aion"". The last two works being by Carl Jung. Very interesting and even inspiring for those interested in Jung, Grail, Merlin, Arthur, Celtic and Celtic Christian subjects from before the ""Dark Ages"" until the ""Present""."
2,Okay,This was better than the earring. You still had to look hard to make out what it was suppose to be.
2,Quality not what I would want.,"I had initially registered for this set online, the price seemed right (I believe that crib bedding is outrageously expensive considering) and it had such great reviews. I am so glad I actually went to a BRU and looked at it. The bumper was flimsy - it bunched around the sides of the crib, you would have to sew or velcro more ties to keep it in place and I would still be afraid the baby could get caught if it bunched over their face. The comforter (which I would just use when she was on the floor not actually in the crib) was thin and the material scratchy feeling. If cost is an issue I would suggest not buying the crib sets, and sticking to the seperates."
2,It is Not as Bright as it looks on line,"HiAfter looking at this on line it looks very cute , but i am sorry to say when i got the package it looked like a used set it was very dull the colours were fadded i was very disapointed . May be I got a odd one but buy with caution sorry ."
2,Greatly Disappointed,"After reading the positive views on this nursery bedding. I couldn't wait to see it. It looked like everything I would want for my baby's bedroom. I am a huge teddy bear fan, and as I child was know for reading to my stuffed animals. When I went to Babies R Us to look at this set, the 3D bears were not cute at all. And the colors on the quilt are very subdued. Don't be fooled by all these positive views."
4,Adorable and Affordable!!,"When my husband and I found out we were expecting our first child, we knew immediately we wanted something practical, cute, and affordable for either gender! When we came across this set, we both fell in love with the bedding and the price!The reason I gave the set four stars instead of five was because it took us quite a while to find a store that had it in stock! So, if you want this bedding, take my advice and call around to your local and surrounding Babies R Us stores before heading to a location to make sure they have it!"
4,Cute bear,I've been searching for a perfect bedding set for my daughter's room. I don't want anything that is too girly. Most of the bedding that I like are very expensive. I'm so excited when I found this one. The price is excellent and it's perfect for her. It's cute and not too girly. She loves playing with the interactive headboard. Overall it's a good product. I only gave 4 stars because the color is a little dull. It would be nicer if the color is a little bit brighter.
5,Strangers in the Night,"Maggie Shayne has a rare gift for turning words into gold. Strangers in the Night, is perfect for someone who enjoys romance with an exciting mix of twists, turns and events. This story is an interesting combination of romance,suspence and the supernatural which has the right combination to appeal to numerous types of readers."
3,"4 stars for the first, 2 for the others.","I wasn't expecting these type of stories at all, I thought they would just be romances. I thought Dark Journey was the best, even though I had left it till last, because the premise sounded the worst. The other two stories didn't really impress me at all"
4,No More Fear,"""He's My Brother"" is the story of a black activist (Dr. John Perkins) and a former Klansman (Thomas Tarrants, III). Their stories are told side by side, from the 1970s to the early 1990s, when they met in Washington, DC.Tarrants tells of his capture, imprisonment, and conversion from the dogmas of Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan. Perkins tells of his days living in the South under the shadow of the Klan, striving for equal rights for the people he led.Their tales are gritty but easy to follow and even identify with. The use of the word 'nigger' may offend some people, but I think this book is an excellent resource for any Sunday school study on real racial healing, intentional relationship, and commitment to change.Listen. Learn. Love.--Linda Leigh Hargrove is the author of two works of fiction: The Making of Isaac Hunt (2007) and Loving Cee Cee Johnson (2008). Her writings blend suspense, humor, and faith into compelling stories about race and class in America."
5,Great,The product came quickly in the mail and was exactly as described by the seller. Good quality that will last. I used it to build a quick load hopper for my cyclone feeder system. Works great.
4,Great shoe - sizing problem!,"Like most Bally - expect the best - but the size is at least one size big - don't know what the deal is with Bally, anything Swiss made are too large - otherwise a great shoe!"
1,Never buy another,"I have been sorely disapointed in the entire series of the Chilton ""Total Care "" line of books. Many of us who purchase these manuals are familiar whith the much older Chilton manuals and these books are nothing like them. Often the books are under illustrated(or offer generic advice) and frankly do not even describe the same vehicle or it's components. I have been a professional mechanic for many years and cannot recommend this book for anyone who is serious about repairing their own vehicle. It will however suit those wishing merely to change their own oil and filter and perhaps the occasional (gasp) tire. The Haynes manual series is far superior in every resect for the more serious owner."
2,Save yourself the trouble..buy Haynes!,Chilton manuals have indeed seen better days. This book has very little helpful info. I agree with the above reviewer that the Haynes Manuals are far superior to Chilton. I own them both and hardly crack open the Chilton.
1,Not much help.,"We were trying to replace the heater core, the instructions were foggy to say the least. Further repairs or maintenance just as foggy, its a good book if you have a lot of experience with repairing the vehicle and don't need a how to. Amazingly the ""Ford Tempo Mercury Topaz 1984-94"" book by Mark Christman, which is by the same company, was a lot better for repairs and maintenance. But neither book helped with replacing the heater core, we eventually used other resources for more ideas on how to actually get to the heater core to get it out."
2,Disappointed,Chilton's Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz Repair Manual 1984-94 is not for the average car owner. It is probably not even for the average mechanic. It is written in difficult language and at times seems to display unnecessarily complicated methods of performing simple tasks. From beginning to index it offers low quality information and instruction. There are too many diagrams and not enough photos. The photos available are poor. Overall this book was not very useful to me. I have used the Haynes manual for the same car and found it much more useful.
5,Great Advice and Funny too!,Margaret Bigger's series of wedding books are winners! Filled with good humor and lots of great wedding advice. Highly recommended.
4,Great gift for any francophile,"Now a confirmed francophile after honeymooning in Paris, my daughter is delighted with this collection of authentic bistro recipes and music. With the CD and recipes, easy enough even for her novice cooking skills, she can re-create the Parisian mood at home while entertaining family and friends. The only thing lacking are more photographs of the prepared recipes as food is to be savored by our mouth, nose and eyes."
4,An Absolute Must,"If only for the music. This collection, book and cd contains recipes and music in the french style, lively and lovely. For those of you who love good food and great music, here you will find both. The recipes are in great french fashion, ie: Coq au Vin, Lentils with ham, Soft boiled eggs with Morels, Provencal Garlic Soup and the desserts here are as rich as the food offerings. The music is oh so lovely, not a sour note in the lot. If you enjoy cooking and eating, especially french food, you can now do so with fabulous, jazzy yet gentle music to match. Sharon O' Connor has really done her research.I give it a four because I fell the content of the book could have been expanded upon. For what this book costs, I would wait for a better deal.Overall, a job beautifully executed. Enjoy!"
4,Still popular with kids today!,"I grew up reading Enid Blyton stories, and the Famous Five were always my favourites. I now live in America, and have two young boys who are in to all the latest video games, but they love these Famous Five audiobooks. We have the whole series. Yes, they are dated, but still very entertaining."
5,"Studio Recording Is Great, But The Live Show Was Awesome!!!","... This is truly one of the greatest albums ever made. As good as this album is, the live show was even better. Joe & his band at this time looked like a bunch of misfits on stage, but the sound they produced were unbelievable... Thanks Joe for staying on the cutting edge with your creativity!"
4,enjoyable melodies,"Blaze of Glory is a joy. The way Joe Jackson blends one song into the next makes this album seem like a continuous playing melodic journey.The only reason I didn't give it a five is because I thought all the songs weren't as complete as JJ's earlier albums, such as Jumpin' Jive, Night and Day, and even Big World."
2,not nearly Joe's best,"Best Joe Jackson album? Good place to start for peopleunfamiliar with this man's work? You've got to be kidding!This album is probably the worst JJ album (which is to sayit's still a decent piece of work, but no where near thequality of ""Look Sharp!"", ""Beat Crazy"", or even the albumhe put out right after this one, ""Laughter & Lust""). Thisalbum finds Joe at his most sappy (""Human Touch"") andleast witty (""Evil Empire""). Skip this one. I think there's areason this one's no longer in print."
5,A must have for Joe Jackson fans,"I don't know if he realizes it or not but this is his best disc so far in a long career of great music. The songs flow together like a story of life and love. Nineteen forever is my most favorite song because it describes the way I felt at the time this disc came out, over 30 and feeling like I was still a teen. Tomorrow's World, Evil Empire, Down to London, this disc got me through some of the worst times in my life, living with Cancer and it's many treatments. I would just put the head phones on and go to another place. Thanks Joe for creating such a beautiful group of songs, they are all top notch."
2,not durable,"bought this item because of the ""permanent"" wick. it works fine although it doesn't evaporate nearly as much as the throw-away paper wicks. (it will smell after a while but responds to soaking with mild bleach). the problem I have with this machine is the fragile fan. after less than a full winter season of use, the fan died on me, and I had to get it replaced by hunter. after putting it away for the summer, the fan again died after less than two months of use. now, I use this unit almost continuously but I would have expected hunter to make better fans. stay away from this model if you use your humidifier for more than a few hours a day."
2,Bad Fan,The fan started to make a loud kicking sound within a day of use. Returned and got a new one and the fan started to make the same sound with in 2 days of use. This is not a durable unit. I am going back to ultrasonic with ion exchange cartridge.
1,But where is humidity?,I have a newer one with LCD display but the same design with PermaWick filter.Compared to my hot steam humidifier this one produces only 1/4 to 1/3 of the vapor when running on low. I can't have it run on high due to the excessive noise it makes in high.Even on low the noise is harder from me to tolerate compared to my hot steam humidifier.It will be returned.
1,hunter humidifier useless,this humidifier was great for about half a season. then the fan started making loud noises. the unit is not worth sending in to hunter to fix- i would not reccomend this unit unless you're deaf and don't mind the noise.
3,Hunter 33252 Humdifier,"This model from Hunter is acceptable at best. It has been discontinued by Hunter, and it's not a ""carefree"" unit , as claimed. The humdification specs are way overstated, but it will do a small room. It comes with one filter - good perhaps for one season and are about $15.00 to replace."
2,Multiple uses except that of a humidifier.,"This product has mulitple uses. This product is for you if you a)want a fancy fan with a night light, b) need to water your floor every so often, c) are deaf and don't mind the loud sound. If you're actually looking for a humidifier then look somewhere else. We've had this humidifier for three weeks and not once has it ever reached the desired humidity. You'll have better luck finding bigfoot than ever seeing the green humidity level indicator light up."
2,Ancora,"This is a very good and relaxing CD, I can listen to it without getting tired of the music. I work on the computer all day and this sort of music helps me stay relatively stress free. I recommend it for anyone who needs some relaxing music."
2,Is this the Spanish version?,"I still don't ""get"" where Simon Cowell considers Il Divo opera singers. They are contemporary, mostly non-English singers. I 've grown to like their first CD and enjoyed the Christmas CD (except Over the Rainbow, Christmas???) When I started to listen to ANCORA, I checked to see if I had the Spanish version. (at least give English translation) Most of these songs sound the same and one runs into another. I was hopping their 2nd CD would show improvement. If this had been their first, I doubt I'd purchase another. I am seeing them 2/10 in NYC. I'm not so sure I still want to go.PS I think this is the 2nd time we've been ripped off with only 10 songs....but then again, that might just be a good thing."
1,I bought this for my mom,"Horrible music, get it off my recommendations list Amazon, please!If you like this kind of music, there are much better groups...try Westlife instead."
1,"yikes, really","Received this cd as a gift. Really horrible, don't know if they can sing it right and just sing like this for the masses to make money. And when the music arrangement is so loud and bad one suspects the voice has something to hide."
4,Il Divo is terrific!,"Loved the CD and play it over and over. Terrific, varied music and they have wonderful voices. Helps with my commute to work..."
5,marvelous voices,"Bought this to complete my Il Divo collection. Marvelous voices, solo or combo, excellent arrangements, wide-ranging repertoire mostly sung in Italian and Spanish. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. I sing along every day on the way to work and back."
2,Yeah..,"The album is pretty good musically, but it is practically all in Spanish. The thing I loved most about their last album was it was diverse with English, Italian and Spanish. There is ONE Italian song on this album. Personally, I find this kind of music to be best suited to the Italian language."
5,Outstanding in every way.,I have no words to explain how Il Divo has made my life more enjoyable. I am looking forward to more of their work in the future. They are the best young entertainers in the world.
1,not worth your money,"Except for ""I Believe"" there is nothing here worth listening to. Their first album was good"
1,Il Heavo,"Wretched and wrong. I guess appealing to the lowest common denominator makes lots of money. Carlos will need all that cash so he can achieve his greatest ambition ""To have all the knickers on my wall of all the beautiful girls that they throw to us on stage!"" From what I can tell they're all granny (...) or tighty-whiteys!"
3,Just a personal opinion.....,"I am a loyal fan of Il Divo, and will continue to be one. TheirChristmas cd was beautiful, and when I heard the ""Il Divo"" cd for the first time I was absolutely mesmerized! Their voices are phenomenal! The music that was chosen for that cd was perfect! I now have ""Ancora"", and am sad to say that I am disappointed in this new cd. To me, and this is my opinion, I feel as though this new cd was done in a rush. The musiclacked the careful consideration that was given to their official premier album. The music is beautiful, but the passion is missing."
5,Finally - Great Voices That Know How to Treat Music,Finally we have singers who actually know what singing is all about - making vocal love to the music! There is nobody on the vocal scene who can match the voices of these four men! Bravo Simon - bring us more.
5,WOW!!,This CD is beyond beautiful music! The voices of these men are breathtaking. You don't have to understand the language to enjoy this marvelous CD. It truly sends chills down my spine to hear these gifted men sing. I sent for their Christmas CD a few days ago and just hearing a little from Amazon...it will be one of my favorites!I can't say enough about their rich voices and beautiful music.If you are having a bad day....put this on and you will feel like you're in Heaven!
5,Absolutely Awesome,"Men hate it, [cause they are jealous], but women love it. I don't usually like male opera singers, but these guys are mesmerizing!"
3,good,"not quite as good as the first album, but still good. I was a little dissappointed. I will try another one by Il Divo."
3,Ancora,"I wished there were more songs in English. However, they are good and if you are a fan you will enjoy."
2,Not worth it,"dont get me wrong i am a FAn, but this album seems to be a compilation of some songs discarded to be part of their first album, with the exception of ""Isabel"" & ""all by myself""....""Aranjuez"" is ok , not exceptional.......""O holy night"" is from their Xmas album as ""Ave Maria"".......my advice: wait for a 3rd album....dont waste your money on this one.......or , buy their first album. by the way the vendor sent me an e-mail requesting i deleted my commnet as the review has to be regarding their shipping expertise........i give them 5 for shipping........2 for manners.......i stand by my perception of this CD."
3,Not a big fan of this CD,"Other than ""I Believe In You"" with Celine Dion, I'm not thrilled with this CD. I like their first CD better. The music selections on this CD don't thrill me and the blend between the musicians again seems ""completitive"" on many of the songs. Don't get me wrong, I think each singer is great in their own right, but as a group it just doesn't work for me. Carlos is probably the best singer in the group, but his voice often overpowers the others. I wish I could be a little more enthusiastic aboiut this CD because I generally like this kind of music. This CD, however, just doesn't do it for me."
5,Ancora,"Their sound is truly comforting and romantic. I have every item this group has put out, including their calendar.In my business (Logistics) which is stressful, this group puts me in a calm demure and I am sure my vendors appreciate it, especially when my freight delivery encounters a problem."
5,Too Short,"My only complaint about this masterpiece is its short length (32 minutes). Even ""All By Myself"", a song which I was never fond of, was extremely well done."
4,Il Divo Ancora,If you like tenors ( especially gorgeous ones with equally gorgeous voices) you will love this recording. They are spectacular
1,Huh?,"I just don't get this one. I would not recommend this CD, I couldn't even get through the entire CD it is so bad. Sorry folks, just my opinion."
1,here we go again,"well, il Divo is back, no longer wearing flower pots on their heads, realizing that you must write other songs because ""whip it"" has been used to death. the 80's reign once again. yawn."
1,Il Dufus,"When I first tuned into Il Dorko's cover of Eric Carmen's ""All By Myself"", my dog was in more pain than her traumatic spaying. In fact, the whole animal kingdom seemed to be heading for the hills upon hearing this sonic tsunami. I urge you to follow in the footsteps of Odysseus and plug your ears with beeswax so you don't have to hear the wretched wailing of these male sirens."
5,CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC,"Another one of Simon Cowell's great ideas. Il Divo's music is a combination of classic, contemporary, romantic and it really works! I enjoy the blend of the four different voices together. This is my third CD of Il Divo and I am enjoying it very much. Great music as background when you are having dinner guests or when you just want to relax in the evening."
4,First One Was Better.,"Their formula works well overall. Pop ballads in orchestral settings, for the four men to take turns doing solo duties within the verses, & then sing together in the chorus & bridge. There were two outstanding songs here. Their Italian version of Mariah Carey's ""Hero,"" & the closing song ""Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore. They sing these two with far more brio than the others. Make no mistake, this group has a very long & bright future in front of them. As with their debut, Carlos' powerful baritone carries most of the weight of the four. I could see him eventually being a solo star. This was better than the Christmas release, but not as good as their debut. Lastly, it was fourteen minutes shorter."
3,Music and voices wonderful . . . but lacking,The entire CD is 39 minutes long. This is an example of why Ipods and MP3 players will continue to become more and more popular. 39 minutes doesn't even make it through my lunch hour! It also needs more variety in the choice of music. I really enjoyed it but it didn't seem to soar as much as the first one or the Christmas album.
3,ok,Listened many times. They it got scratched really fast. Tossed in the trash. Made cheap? Who knows. Trashed it right away.
5,Can't get enough of Il Divo,"Many CD's contain one or two ""fillers"" that are quite forgettable. This CD doesn't fall into that easy trap. All of the songs on this CD are beautifully performed by these wonderfully talented vocalists. Can't wait for their next CD!"
5,Ancora,"Amazing voices blend so well and the selections are in Italian, but I know the songs, so can sing along in English."
3,Better flier than writer,"Louise Thaden won prizes in a world men ruled. A businesswoman, professional flier, wife and mother she was among those who shown the brightest in aviation's golden age. But her book is choppy, with anecdotes bumping into one another with no transistions. Some of the anecodtes take longer to set up than to tell, and a few were no doubt more impressive in the experience than in the telling. You will get a taste of daring, discomfort and pride here, but it is more a garnish than a course to remember."
4,A Complete Collection of Tornado Hits,"Ridin' the Wind is a very complete collection of Tornados' hits and album songs. All the greats are there: Telstar, Ridin the Wind, Love and Fury, Globe Trotting, The Ice Cream Man, Exodus, Early Bird, Pop Art Goes Mozart, Too Much in Love to Hear and more. The collection also includes B-sides, EP and album songs, live tracks, and previously unreleased material. Overall, the selection is very good, but it is obvious that some songs were recorded as filler material. Still, it is a very enjoyable collection with an informative liner note/poster to accompany it. Even though I was born several years after the last Tornados recordings, I find their music very enjoyable. Give it a chance, as it will grow on you!"
2,"""Live From The Ghetto"" Review","Whether he's ""Cold 187"" or ""Big Hutch"", Gregory Hutchinson has been regarded by many as one of the most underrated producers on the West Coast rap scene. The producer and frontman for Above The Law has dropped classic gems like ""Livin' Like Hustlers"" and ""Uncle Sam's Curse"" with his group but they have never been able to mantain a following. Big Hutch's second solo, ""Live From The Ghetto"" doesn't really do the veteran producer much justice. The very same guy who blessed us with the amazing ""Black Superman"" in 1994 seems a little uninspired on the production tip these days. Aside from the laid-back ""I Used To Respect You"", this album doesn't do much for me. Maybe I was expecting more here but I can't help but feel unimpressed by ""Live From The Ghetto""."
5,Love this album,"Always creative, nobody produces beats and flows like Hutch. Every song is a gem. Been listening to this album for years, and grab this even before my old Above The Law CDs."
4,Return of the Real,"Finally, a new release from the camp of legendary west coast rappers Above The Law. This album refreshes the scene with the same hard, g-funk sound that Hutch and ATL originated. Hutch is top notch when it comes to producing, so you can expect a quality effort when he has his hand in it. This album is no different. Solid solo follow up album to Executive Decisions. There are a couple tracks that he tried something innovative, with different results. All said and done, the album is still bumpin'. ""Gutta"" is classic. This is how the REAL west coast puts it down. Check out this album."
3,Sound quality is a minor drawback,"This box set is a good representation of Cindy Lauper's career; however, the price you REALLY pay for getting so much at such a relatively low cost is a frustrating sound quality. You'll hear the original productions of the songs, yes, but it seems as if the bass factor on this compilation was turned down during transfer and, consequently, every song has a slightly-flat quality to it. You will need to turn the bass control on your personal music system all the way up if you want to hear a satisfying sound."
5,"""Great Cyndi Lauper"" CD","I really enjoyed listening to ""Great Cyndi Lauper"" CD. I believe one can say that Cyndi Lauper is one of the great singers of our time."
5,Revelation for Dummies,This book has helped us make sense of Revelation. It is a very balanced approach. It explainsdifferent ideas and you can choose which one you like.
1,did not like,This book was very confusing to even get started on for me. Found a much better book to help me understand.
5,Good Book for Any Writer by Author Robin Shope,"Being an author, I am always looking for ways to better my craft, learn something new, see life and my characters through different eyes. I learned some wonderful new things from reading this book. It made me reflect on the characters I already created to see if I hit the mark with them, according to this author. I had. I also learned some new techiniques in character development which I found to be invaluable. In this world of many authors, its important to keep on top of the pack.The Valentine Edition"
5,Easy to understand and use,I started using this book for my writing the very day I received it. It's great--I can't recommend it highly enough
5,I love this book!,"I agree. It deserves a sixth star. It always plays a part in characterization for me, even if I don't use an archetype specifically from the book, or I make my heroine the ""BAD BOY"" whatever, it's the ultimate instruction book, and it gives you movie roles the archetype would fit. There's a section on how two archetypes would get along, or NOT get along. I don't plot a book without it. I don't give a character workshop without recommending it, either."
5,monsters lunchbox,"Monster's Lunchbox is the boy version of girl 'princess fantasy'! Slimey, gooey, monster-friendly yuck induces ughs and oohs that all little boys love to hate. My sons, my sons' friends, and now my grandson all give a thumbs-up to this 'treasure'. A definite joy to experience as a read-aloud. Thank you, Marc Brown!PS Little girls squeal with delight at this 'good-read' as well :-)"
3,Fun fun book,My kids love this book and I look forward to pulling it out every year around Halloween. We also have used it in our homeschooling classroom -- many opportunities for lesson extensions.
4,ben gay patch relief,Its a great product. Use it when ever my back begins to give me trouble; especially when traveling & have been sitting to long. Easy to carry where ever you go.
5,Better Than Expected,It was better than expected and I would recommend for anyone who is a fan of Danielle Steel's books and movie like I am. It completes my collection
5,Great Collection,This collection was excellent. The Promise skipped a little in the beginning and the straightened out and I was able to watch it just fine.
4,You Have To Be A Danielle Steele Lover,If you are a Danielle Steele lover you will enjoy this! I saw Star on t.v. and enjoyed that but haven't seen the others yet nor have I taken the wrapper off the DVD yet.
1,Absolutely dire,"""The Promise"" is something of a camp classic so we know what to expect.The other films in this set are so bad, even my wife - who is a major schlockaholic - found them almost unwatchable."
4,3 Out of 4 Great Films and 1 Average,"I've read and own most of Danielle Steel's work over the years. Palomino, Star, & Secrets being all highly regarded and enjoyable works & films. The Promise is one I was aware of but had never watched until I bought this collection--I believe it is the only way to get it. It was OK. Definitely not among the best but worth the time."
3,TV Movies,I enjoyed these movies before on the tv but you know how tv is with commercial after commercial so I was pleased when they released these onto dvd. It was nice not being bombarded with ads and having to wait to see what would happen next. I received my dvds in a timely manner. I have purchased several items before on amazon and I will probably continue to do so. I hope amazon will continue to offer tv movies on dvds as they are so hard to find and there are so many good movies that were made for tv and are not shown anymore.
1,This was a gift for my mother - not my thing. ;-),This was a gift for my mother - not my thing. ;-)(eight more words are required so here they are.)
5,Revisiting Favorites,"I bought The Lost Sheep and House Upon the Rock 15 years ago for my children. I have tried to find more of the books since I now have grandchildren. I was very excited to find The Stories that Jesus told. My grandson, 6, and I enjoy reading it every night when he comes for a visit. We love the humor and the illustrations! Please bring more of these books back. We want more."
5,Anguished!,"I'm in deep grief over this book! I mailed my copy to a dear young friend in England just before Christmas. I hadn't had it long, so I was sure I could order another for myself. Alas! It is out of print! The picture of the farmer and the sheep having a party was splendid! Please, please publish again! (Anyone have an extra copy?)"
4,Great introduction to morals for children.,I bought this book for my 3 year old daughterwho loves the illustrations and understands the morals. This is a great book which teaches christian ideals in a relaxed manner. I'm impressed !!!!(and I can't get it in NZ)
5,Best shampoo for moisture!,"This was recommended to me by my salon. It is an awesome, creamy, wonderful smelling conditioner. Paired with the shampoo it is a just have even though it is pricey."
3,Decent conditioner,"This is a decent conditioner for every day but not exceptional. For the price I expected something that would provide more moisturizing. I don't dislike it, but will not reorder it. I love Lanza's Trauma Treatment leave in conditioner, so I expected a little more from this product."
5,Happy with,"HI, This is a great book and I purchased it also for sharing with others.It arrived in great shape and the service was very good. Would purchase again from this person."
5,Here is my educated prediction of the top 50.,Here is my predicted list in chronological order:1. Buddy Rogers2. Bruno Sammartino3. Ivan Koloff4. Gorilla Monsoon5. Ernie Ladd6. Pedro Morales7. Freddie Blassie8. Andre the Giant9. The Fabulous Moolah10. Superstar Billy Graham11. Lou Albanio12. Bob Backlund13. Jimmy Snuka14. Hulk Hogan15. Big John Studd16. Bobby Heenan17. Rowdy Roddy Piper18. Jake Roberts19. Ricky Steamboat20. Randy Savage21. Ted DiBiasie22. Sherri Martel23. Mean Gene Okerlund24. The Ulimate Warrior25. Mr. Perfect26. Bret Hart27. Ric Flair28. Shawn Michaels29. The Undertaker30. Yokozuna31. Diesel32. Steve Austin33. Jerry Lawler34. Jim Ross35. Mick Foley36. Triple H37. The Rock38. Chris Jericho39. Kurt Angle40. Edge41. The Dudley Boyz42. The Big Show43. Eddie Guerrero44. Trish Stratus45. Rey Mysterio46. Brock Lesnar47. Booker T48. John Cena49. Batista50. Randy OrtonI'm not going to dare to get the ranking right. If I'm off it'll only be by one or two.
1,THIS LIST MUST BE A JOKE,"RIC FLAIR IS THE GREATEST WRESTLER EVER. Hogan is where on this list? Ridiculous!Edge and Misterio are how far up?! Angle deserves a higher ranking, as he may be THE most talented athlete ever to lace up in wrestling history, watch his matches, seriously. My top 10...1. RIC FLAIR (The pro wrestling god) 2. STEVE AUSTIN (Biggest money maker ever)3. SHAWN MICHAELS (showstopper, main event) 4. Hulk Hogan (the immortal, Hulkamania) 5.Undertaker (greatest gimmick, greatest big man) 6. Roddy Piper (best heat man ever)7. Bret Hart (Purest North American technician ever?) 8. Andre the Giant (8th wonder of the world, draws a crowd) 9. Randy Savage (Between Promos, look, and ability, hard to beat) 10. The Rock (easily could have been top 3 had he not left wrestling prematurely, but who can blame him?)......race steamboat henning bruno and rhodes are tough to leave outta that ten though. More double dip dvd matches, looking forward to gorilla monsoon stuff."
2,#23??????,"First of all the only reason this dvd got a 2 star review was for the matches on it. I can't believe the WWE seriously put this out. Hogan at 23 is just rediculous....Flair at 17? You gotta be kidding me....they left off so many great talents that should of been on there just to mention a few Dynamite Kid, Davey Boy Smith, Bam Bam Bigelow, Arn Anderson,Sting ( I know he never worked for the company but he deserves to be one of the top 50 of all time) Kevin Nash, Owen Hart, Scott Hall,Tully Blanchard. I just can't believe their ranking systems...they need to take this off the market lolI might dare to say the top ten should be something like this1. Hulk Hogan2. Steve Austin3. Ric Flair4. Bret Hart5. Shawn Michaels6. Randy Savage7. Ricky Steamboat8. Undertaker9. Kurt Angle10.Roddy Pipernow I'm not saying those were my favorite wrestlers but they all acomplished so much ....and I'm sure I'm forgetting someone lol"
4,GOOD!!!,The WWE did a great job with DVD ...The matches are edited old school and present day matches.The WWE these style of DVD's very well
4,Heres some of the matches,"* NWA championship: Lou Thesz vs. Argentina Rocca* Jack Brisco vs. Dory Funk Jr.* Boxing Match: Gorilla Monsoon vs. Andre The Giant* WWE Championship: Hulk Hogan vs. The Iron Sheik(Dec 28, 1984)* Rick Rude vs. Ricky Steamboat* The Rock vs. Mankind(halftime Heat)* Ric Flair vs. Bret Hart(WWE Championship)* Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show* Edge vs. The Undertaker(Wrestlemania 24)* Jerry Lawler vs Curt Hening(AWA Aug 1988)These are some of the matches there should be a total of 20 or so for this DVD, I think this will be a good DVD looking forward to it thanks for reading."
3,Money grab,"This is a obvious moneygrab, enterteining though. Dont need to say much but Flair is 17, Hulk Hogan is number 23 and LOL piper is number 10. This is all that needs to be said about this video.........Oh yea and no Cactus jack................"
1,The ranking was made to aggravate long time fans,"Hulk Hogan at number 23? Please! They didn't try to legitimately compose a list of the top fifty, they just made a list that they knew would anger the long time fans. I understand that Hogan and Flair are in TNA right now, but any top ten that doesn't have Hogan and Flair in the top tier is a joke. I would not recommend purchasing this due to the ridiculous ranking. Only buy it if you are interested in the match selections. WWE intentionally made this to be controversial. Now the reason for that is anyone's guess. I would say they either wanted to rewrite history and push their favorites to the young fans that don't know any better or they hoped controversy creates cash."
3,Simple child like,The storyline is a bit banal and tends to preach more than demonstrate christian beliefs. No complexity and most definitely no intellectual appeal
4,Had to read the entire series!,"I believe I started out with a free Kindle Book 1 in the Ivy Malone series. I was hooked! The LoL (Little Old Lady), Ivy Malone is a kick in the pants. Whether its solving murders, being hunted down by ""mafia types"" or catching the eye of eligible gentlemen, she never has a dull moment. It is funny, witty and the writing often had me on the edge of my seat between chapters. Ivy is an inspiration. Being a LoL does not have to be dull! I call Ivy a contemporary Miss Marple, with an edge."
5,woman of a certain age fleeing murderers,"Any of us of a certain age will love this book - she uses her ""invisibility"" to great advantage and I find it true in my life too."
4,Excellent read,If you enjoy the Agatha Christie Miss maple then you are in for a treat. Well written and keeps the reader interested.
